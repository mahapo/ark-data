[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 Notes on Editions of Sefer Yetzirah in English Don Karr Sefer Yetzirah (B OOK OF F ORMATION , hereafter SY) is the oldest known speculative treatise in Hebrew. There are three prime recensions of SY: short, long, and one somewhere in between called the Saadian recension (in that it was the basis of Saadia’s commentary of the early tenth century).* Even the longest of these contains something less than 2500 words. The date of SY’s composition remains a matter of some debate, but most scholars agree that it was written or compiled between the second and sixth centuries. However, Steven M. Wasserstrom has offered a strong case for the ninth century—within an Islamic milieu.** It was certainly extant by the tenth century, for it exerted a great influence on speculative and mystical thought from that time on. Commenting on SY, Elliot R. Wolfson stated, “Properly speaking, the work should not be described as a single composition, but rather as a composite of distinct literary strands that have been woven together through a complicated redactional process whose stages are not clearly discernable.”** __________ * Ithamar Gruenwald “A Preliminary Critical Edition of Sefer Yezirah,” in Israel Oriental Studies 1 (1971); A. Peter Hayman, “Introduction,” Sefer Yesira: Edition, Translation and Text-Critical Commentary (Tuebingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004). Aryeh Kaplan adds a fourth: the Gra/Ari version; see below, p. 13. ** The comments of both Steven M. Wasserstrom and Elliot R. Wolfson were made as discussants at the Association for Jewish Studies 33 rd Annual Conference (Washington, DC: December 16, 2001) in the session titled “ Sefer Yesirah : Mystical and Philosophical Intertexts.” See Wasserstrom’s article, “Sefer Yesira and Early Islam: A Reappraisal (in The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy , vol. 3 no. 1: 1993) and his comments in Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995), pages 126-133.

It was from the first chapter of SY that Kabbalah derived the term sefirot and the notion of these as metaphysical stages of creation. The remaining chapters of SY tell of the powers and correspondences of the twenty-two Hebrew letters. In 1971, Gruenwald noted, “Although Sefer Yezira is one of the most frequently published works of Jewish esoteric lore, there is no authoritative text available to those who want to study the book. To make a long story short, there are at least three main recensions of the book, and except for one recension (the so-called Saadian recension) all the printed texts are defective.”* Gruenwald was commenting on the state of editions in Hebrew, the inadequacies of which would inevitably be reflected in any translation. Armed with a more complete array of textual witnesses, many of which were not available to Gruenwald in 1971, A. Peter Hayman has produced Sefer Yesira: Edition, Translation and Text-Critical Commentary (Tuebingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004), which is the most thorough scholarly treatment of SY in English to date. The core of Hayman’s book is a synoptic edition of SY in Hebrew and English offering specific MS versions of the three recensions. Because of its importance—and no doubt because of its brevity—SY has been put into English many times. All of the English translations of SY which I have seen are discussed in P ART 1: T RANSLATIONS . I shall deal with these in chronological order, starting with the first, that of Isadore Kalisch from 1877, and concluding with the most recent, that of A. Peter Hayman from 2004.

New York: L.H. Frank & Co., 1877. Reprinted San Jose: AMORC , 1948, with several reprint editions following; more recently (late ’eighties) reprinted by Heptangle (Gillette) in an overpriced deluxe edition. Kalisch gives a straightforward translation, showing the English and Hebrew side by side. His notes clarify the ideas and language of SY, often referring to readings from major commentaries and other rabbinic works. The publisher’s forward in __________ * In the introduction to “Preliminary Critical Edition....”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 the AMORC edition says, “The service Dr. Kalisch rendered in 1877 by his first English translation of the Sepher Yezirah has grown ever greater with the passing years. Other translations, it is true, have a certain merit; none the less, none has surpassed and few have equaled the work which he did.” This comment was written in 1948, but one could have made a case to fully concur until relatively recently ( i.e. , until Kaplan [1990]; see below, page 13). Kalisch translated what appears to be the long version.* The work is free of any sort of occult agenda—a feature which plagues many of the versions discussed hereafter. A translation of SY was published in 1883 (2 nd edition, 1886) in Alfred Edersheim’s ambitious Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah (London and Bombay: Longmans/Green and Company, 2 volumes; reprinted in recent years as a single volume by several publishers: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1943 through 1981; MacDonald Publishing and World Bible Publishing Company in 1994; Hendrickson Publishers in 1993 and 1997). The translation appears in Appendix V, Section 4. After a perfunctory description of Kabbalah, which concludes, “...the book Yetsirah is the oldest Kabbalistic document,” the text of SY is summarized. The translation itself is qualified: “...not only...the meaning of the expressions but even their translations, is in controversy. Hence, not unfrequently, our rendering must be regarded as our interpretation of the mysterious original.” The translated text is then given in italics , with notes, bracketed or parenthetical words, and explanatory remarks in regular type. What we get is an earnest effort upon a rather terse version of SY (which, for instance, omits the “predominations” of the letters from chapter 4). The notes and additions are more helpful than intrusive, and where he is unsure, Edersheim nobly places a question mark next to his variant renderings. __________ * The short version, thought by some to be more representative of the original text, begins (chapter 1, paragraph 1) Thirty-two mysterious ways has the Lord, Lord of Hosts, ordained through Scribe, Script, and Scroll. (from Phineas Mordell’s translation) By contrast, the long version immerses this simple line in a stream of biblical epithets: In Thirty-two paths of wisdom did Yah, Lord of hosts, God of Israel, the living God, king of the universe, God almighty, merciful, gracious, exalted, Who dwells in an eternity of holiness, holy is His name, create His universe by three enumerations: number, word, and script. (from a partial translation of my own) Further, with this first paragraph we run into complications with the last several words, which are rendered differently by each translator. Kalisch has “by three Sepharim, namely: 1) S’for; 2) Sippor; and 3) Sapher,” leaving these transliterated in the text to then be explained in his notes. The anonymous Bray Press edition ends Mishna Aleph ( i.e. paragraph 1), “He creates His world in three forms, In letter, in number, in sound.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Westcott, William Wynn. Sepher Yetzirah. The Book of Formation and the Thirty- two Paths of Wisdom, translated from the Hebrew. Bath: Robert H.

Westcott’s SY is also included in the most recent reprint of Collectanae Hermetica , a series which Westcott edited 1893-1911 (Weiser, 1998). Westcott was an occultist who, with S.L.M. Mathers, was a founding member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Both Westcott and Mathers put several magical and mystical texts into English in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Most pertinent to Kabbalah are Mathers’ Kabbalah Unveiled (sections of the Zohar after the Latin of Knorr von Rosenroth) and Westcott’s SY, which, in spite of the claim on the title page that the work was “translated from the Hebrew,” appears to have been totally dependent on a Latin version. A.E. Waite, in his introduction to the Stenring translation (discussed below), says of Westcott’s SY It is based on the text of Rittangelius, compared with some other versions. It was prepared for the use of persons described as theosophists, occult and Hermetic students, whose purpose – if any – may have been served by such a production, but is in reality a paraphrase and fulfills few of the conditions required by scholarship. Even though there is a bit of the pot calling the kettle black in Waite’s comments, they give a fair appraisal of Westcott’s work. Along with SY, Westcott offers an English translation of The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom ; its inclusion is not explained, nor is the text introduced. From other sources (Waite’s introduction to Stenring for one), we learn that The Thirty-two Paths is a late addition to SY, appended in some Latin versions. In a series of short paragraphs, it tells of the intelligences, powers and virtues of the thirty-two paths, which are the ten sefirot plus the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Westcott’s connections with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn afford his treatment of SY a certain pedigree—at least in the eyes of those who involve themselves with Golden Dawn teachings and literature—thus, it has been reprinted far more often than any other version (and appears at a large number of sites on the Internet; see P ART 4 below).

English translation, London and New York: Thorsons and Samuel Weiser, 1977. Even though the original was French, Papus’ work is included here because it offers an SY translation (of sorts) by an influential occultist which has been circulating in English for some time. Unfortunately, one finds Papus’ treatment of SY (pp. 203-48 in the Weiser edition) in the midst of a pseudo-scholarly mess. The entire book is a confusion of elements, Jewish and non-Jewish, many having no connection with Kabbalah at all. There are many astounding errors, and the reader is flogged with a continual mystery mongering. As for the SY section, Papus introduces the text with a verbose and ranging forward followed by an utterly superfluous summary of the text. Finally, there is the text, full of bizarre renderings. Papus gives the three sefarim (SY 1:1) as “number, numbering, and numbered.” He uses E to represent the Hebrew letter aleph in one place, only to use it to represent heh in another. He renders heh-qoph as OCH, and for yod-heh-vav-heh he puts YOAH, then IOAH, and later IEVE. To the usual six chapters of SY, Papus saw fit to add a seventh, consisting of a redundant list of correspondences, an account of the derivatives of the letters, and a general resume. Papus follows SY with not only The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom but also The Fifty Gates of Understanding. The Fifty Gates is a hierarchic list of features of the universe; Papus’ version is derived from Athanasius Kircher’s Oedipus Aegyptiacus (3 volumes, Rome: 1652-5). Papus’ section on SY concludes with an essay, “The Date of the ‘Sepher Yetzirah’” by Dr. Sair A.C. which advances the notion that SY is from the patriarchal age or earlier on the basis that scholars have not proven otherwise—at least not to the satisfaction of subscribers to the occult tradition.* On page 30 of Gershom Scholem’s Kabbalah , an English translation of SY by P. Davidson (elsewhere noted as The Sepher Jetsirah , White County [GA]: 1896) is mentioned. I have not seen it. Given the time and place of this publication, it __________ * Papus’ rendering of eser sefirot belimah (a phrase which opens a series of statements in SY, chapter 1) is “The ten Sephiroth, excepting the ineffable.” It must be conceded that the meaning of belimah or beli mah is open to speculation. Gershom Scholem discussed some of the possible meanings in Origins of the Kabbalah (p. 28): According to some views, the obscure word belimah , which always accompanies the word sefirot, is simply a composite of beli mah – without anything, without actuality, ideal. However, judging from the literal meaning, it should be understood as signifying “closed,” that is, closed within itself. Further, see Peter Hayman’s comments in “Some Observations of Sefer Yesira (1) Its Use of Scripture,” ( Journal of Jewish Studies 35:2 [1984]) concerning belimah , where he mentions its likely derivation from Job 26:7."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 seems most likely that “P.

Mordell, Phineas. The Origins of the Letters and Numerals According to the Sefer Yetzirah. “The present thesis appeared in the Jewish Quarterly Review , New Series for April 1912 vol.

Published by Dropsie College Philadelphia Pa.” S UPPLEMENT : “A Solution of the Pythagorean Number Philosophy.” “Copyright 1922 by Phineas Mordell.” Reprinted, New York: Samuel Weiser, 1975. Mordell’s thesis regarding SY contains notions which are difficult to credit: ...the Sefer Yetzirah, as the earliest Hebrew grammar, contains...the fundamental rules of Hebrew orthography.... ...according to the Sefer Yetzirah, there are ten double letters, and not only seven, as is believed by all commentators since Saadya. In spite of the numerous works written on Hebrew orthography since the beginning of the tenth century, there is not one which may be considered as really based on the Hebrew [on which the SY is based]. Many more troubling statements could be quoted; however, I shall leap to Mordell’s conclusion: Already Abraham Abulafia perceived that the Pythagorean number philosophy is identical with the Sefiroth philosophy of the Sefer Yetzirah. The relation they bear to each other is variously explained. A. F. Thimus shares the view that the Pythagorean philosophy is an adaptation from the Sefer Yetzirah. Others hold that the author of Sefer Yetzirah borrowed his philosophy from Pythagoras and Plato. ... Would it be to [ sic ] bold to conclude that Sefer Yetzirah represents the genuine fragments of Philolaus? Mordell develops his thesis further in a supplement, “A Solution of the Pythagorean Number Philosophy,” which is included in the Weiser reprint of The Origin of the Letters and Numerals. Mordell put his English translation and the Hebrew of SY side by side, but his version is unlike any which I have ever seen, especially in chapter 1, paragraph 3, where Mordell’s translation reads, “The ten double letters are...” (the italics are mine). All other readings and translations put the number of double letters of the Hebrew alphabet at seven.* __________ * It is puzzling that, out of all the possible translations, David Meltzer chose Mordell’s quirky rendering to represent SY in The Secret Garden. Alas, this is not the only doubtful aspect of this well-circulated anthology. See below, the second (**) note on page 8. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Stenring, Knut. The Book of Formation (Sepher Yetzirah) by Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph ... including the 32 Paths of Wisdom, their correspondences with the Hebrew alphabet and the Tarot symbols, with an introduction by Arthur Edward Waite. Philadelphia: David McKay Co., 1923; reprinted New York: Ktav Publishing House, 1970. Stenring refers to his own work as a “word-for-word translation from the Hebrew.” He used a number of SY texts to construct his version. Those parts of the text which Stenring considered “genuine” are printed in ordinary type; those parts which he considered “spurious” are printed in italics . Thus, with Stenring we find the first attempt—in English, at any rate—to separate the long version’s supposed additions from the short version’s presumed original text while presenting both. Stenring supplemented the text with a long section of notes concerning the language of SY, citing numerous alternative readings. He also constructed several charts and tables based on the information in SY. Stenring’s work on SY seems careful and conscientious, but there are some disquieting statements here and there. A paragraph from the notes section serves well as a summary example: The 231 Gates Eighteen hundred years ago, when Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph reduced into writing the secret tradition of the Jews in the “Book of Formation,” he hesitated to unveil the greatest secret of the Kabala, the Arcanum of the Great Symbol, which had been handed down to him from his forefathers. For this reason he embodied it in a riddle (“S.Y.,” II. 4 and 5), which many ancient and modern philosophers have tried in vain to solve. Of all the different tabulations, claiming to be the Great Arcanum of the Kabala, that we have examined, none is correct. The token of the original table ONG and NGO was not to be found in any of them. We have succeeded in solving this riddle. The true Kablistic Symbol the Great Master Key to the theoretical and practical Kabala will be found facing p. 24 of the present translation. [The diagram faces page 21 in the Ktav edition.] In his introduction to Stenring’s book, A.E. Waite diffuses Stenring’s claims somewhat: They [those who consider Stenring’s diagram] will come at least across many curious permutations and will be in agreement with myself that the elaborate Diagram is of considerable interest, from whatever point of view it is approached, and however they may interpret Mr Stenring’s statement that absolute knowledge of a single number is “impossible for a human mind” (p. 37), unless it has opened every Gate of Understanding, i.e., has acquired “an encyclopedic knowledge of all sciences.” Waite’s introduction to Stenring is generally pretty good, though limited by his dependence on Christian sources. He gives a fair account of SY: its background, editions, and content.

(SY translation: pp. 114-16) Hall states that he used Kalisch’s translation as the “foundation” of his “interpretation” of SY, but that “material from other authorities has been incorporated and many passages have been rewritten to simplify the general theme.” He consulted a number of other versions of SY, two of which have been discussed above: Westcott and Stenring. Hall relied heavily on Western occult sources, some of which, such as the works of Mme. Blavatsky and Eliphas Levi, are notoriously unreliable. With Hall, we come to the end of a cycle of fairly frequent productions of SY in English. Between Hall’s translation and the next one reviewed here (that of Work of the Chariot, 1971), there is a lapse of over forty years.

Book of Formation (Sepher Yetzirah). The Letters of Our Father Abraham [WC #1b]. 2 nd edition, Hollywood: Work of the Chariot, 1971. [also at www.workof thechariot.com ] The 2 nd edition includes two appendices: 1. Diagrams; 2. Shuo Kua/I Ching with diagrams; plus SY in Hebrew and Gezer/Sinatic, and a depiction of the Gan Eden alphabet. This version has been neither well known nor, until recently [see the website shown above], generally available. It is included here in part because it is the version of SY on which David Blumenthal ( Understanding Jewish Mysticism [1978], pp. 13-46) based his translation in no small way. While Blumenthal made revisions and additions here and there, he presented a virtual copy of Work of the Chariot’s translation, while saying, “The translation given here is my own, based upon the Hebrew texts in L. Goldschmit...and Sefer Yetsira , anon. ed. (Jerusalem: 1964).” There is bound to be some concurrence in translations of the same text, but Blumenthal’s SY is the same as Work of the Chariot’s, word-for-word, through nearly all of the text. Blumenthal retained Work of the Chariot’s unique readings, e.g., “by border, and letter and number” (chapter 1, paragraph 1). Further, Blumenthal used Work of the Chariot’s format in the setting of lines and phrases. Blumenthal refers to what must be Work of the Chariot’s edition as “an anonymous, uncopyrighted pamphlet which was sent to me through the mail,” making no mention of Work of the Chariot. My copy of Work of the Chariot’s SY shows “ COPYRIGHT – 1971 / WORK OF THE CHARIOT , etc.” on the title page. Work of the Chariot’s translation is arresting, all but poetic, though many readings seem interpretive. A few notes follow the text; thereafter is a series of diagrams derived from various chapters of SY. The 1971 edition includes a translation of “ Shuo Kua (I Ching): A Discussion of the Trigrams.” Two more versions of SY follow, one in the traditional “square” Hebrew, the other in “the original Gezer or Sinatic Hebrew.” The diagrams are also rendered in these two scripts. One of the notes explains the motive for the work: All of the information given in the Book of Formation is here presented in visual form to facilitate meditation in the manner of the Tree of Perfection (Luria): a. each Sephirah may be meditated on individually b. the central Sephirot may be taken as a group c. all of the Sephirot may be taken as a group d. the lettered paths are the gates of release between the Sephirot, the Gates are in the Light of the Endless, and the specific letter is given in the Book of Formation."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"   10 Through the notes, the nature of various meditations is indicated by reference to the diagrams; lines from the Atharva Veda are offered for comparison with SY. Work of the Chariot’s publication seems to be entirely for an immediate mystical purpose. There is no introduction, no history, no account of editions of SY, etc., and the sparse notes are not of the usual sort. In 1971, Ithamar Gruenwald published the “Preliminary Critical Edition of Sefer Yezira” in Israel Oriental Studies , volume 1 (Tel Aviv University); of course, the texts are in Hebrew. In a follow-up article, “Some Critical Notes on the First Part of Sefer Yezira” ( Revue des Etudes juives , CXXXII, no. 4, 1973), Gruenwald gives English translations and analyses of the first sixteen paragraphs of SY. The article is a bit frustrating in spots: some words and quotes are not translated. This is, however, an article of great interest from a reliable scholarly source which touches on many important issues. Doria, Charles; and Lenowitz, Harris. Origins: Creation Texts from the Ancient Mediterranean. Garden City: Anchor Books and AMS Press, 1976. (SY translation: pp. 57-78) On the back cover of the paper edition, Joseph Campbell is quoted: “ Origins is an interesting and scholarly introduction to the texts of the ancient Mediterranean.” Some may find Origins’ treatment of SY interesting, but it is difficult to see how anyone could find any scholarly value in it. The text is done up as free-form poetry and is neither introduced nor supported by notes. The authors were apparently attempting what has been called a “total translation” in which the authors work as both poets & scholars, make use of all those “advances in translation technique, notation & sympathy” developed over the last few decades, from the methods of projective verse to those of etymological translation or of that attention to the recovery of the oral dimension of the poem... (from the “Pre-face to Origins by Jerome Rothenberg) Whatever the aim, the “San Francisco poet” style hardly seems suitable for SY, which is hard dogma in sober, enigmatic language. Poetic format aside, the individual words chosen in this version are often awkward and affected. For example, Origins has “Spiritwind” for ruah (spirit), and “lawed” presumably for khaqaq (“engraved,” though if pointed differently it could mean “decreed” or “legislated”). Origins brand of indulgence infects whole passages, making them stilted and vague.

Suares’ book on SY is one in a series on what he considers “the three great cabalistic works... [namely] Genesis, The Song of Songs and Sepher Yetsira.” Suares does not believe Kabbalah to be mysticism, stating, “...Qabala is a science and... The Sepher Yetsira is a precise and accurate treatise on the structure of cosmic energy, written in a hidden code.” Suares’ thesis rests on the belief that each Hebrew letter “denotes not only a ‘letter’, but also a proof, a symbol and even a miracle revealing its forgotten ontological origin.” In a chapter which is repeated in all three books of this series, Suares explains the letter-code as he has discovered, or re discovered, it. All this, of course, puts something of a spin on Suares’ handling of SY. Each short paragraph of SY is followed by a lengthy explanation, so the text itself is spread in small pieces over some sixty pages. The translation is mannered in a way that serves Suares’ thesis, so it is not always very clear on its own. However, he does include the Hebrew text next to his translation. (anonymous).

The clear translation is followed by observations of the text which analyze elements of the SY in a broad context of various ancient religions and philosophies.

The Fundamentals of Jewish Mysticism. The Book of Creation and Its Commentaries. Northvale: Jason Aronson Inc., 1992. Glotzer’s book gives SY one paragraph at a time (in English and Hebrew), each followed by an extended commentary. Glotzer freely draws from rabbinic sources ranging from the Gaon of Vilna and Saadia to Moses Cordovero and Hayim Vital. This means that the commentary stays within the bounds of traditional Jewish Kabbalah, even if straying from the stated contents of SY. Glotzer’s translation and extended commentary are preceded by a brief introduction to Kabbalah and followed by eight appendices covering particular points of doctrine related to SY, even if only by tradition: the sefirot in the shape of a man, the numerical values of the Hebrew letters, names of God, the thirty-two paths according to Raivad, the soul and the five faces , and two versions of the 231 gates. Overshadowed by Kaplan’s SY, which has been reprinted several times, Glotzer’s Fundamentals has not received the attention that it deserves. Segments of SY appear in Daniel C. Matt’s anthology, The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart and Soul of Jewish Mysticism (San Francisco: Harper-SanFrancisco [a Division of HarperCollins Publishing, New York], 1995). On pages 75-76, Matt gives his translation of SY chapter 1 paragraphs 1-8; on page 108 there is a compilation of SY chapter 2, paragraphs 2 and 4-6, and chapter 6, paragraph 4. Helpful notes are given in the back of the book explaining the terminology of the segments translated. Dan Cohn-Sherbok’s Jewish Mysticism: An Anthology (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1995: pp. 60-66) gives slightly condensed renditions of chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5.

For example, Scholem refers to Kaplan’s translation and commentary, The Bahir (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1979) as “worthless” ( Origins of the Kabbalah , p. 51, n. 1).

The critical edition and its translation follow specific manuscript versions**: one short, one long, one Saadyan, presented side by side, with extensive notes and commentary. Hayman’s SY is the first of a promised three-volume series: This first book “is concerned solely with the text—with the manuscripts, the recensions, the individual readings within the paragraphs” (page v); the second, a collection of Hayman’s papers on SY***; and the third, “a commentary on the content of the book” (page v). ______________ * The commentaries of Saadya Gaon, Dunash Ibn Tamim, Shabbetai Donnolo, and Judah ben Barzillai.

In Kabbalah: New Perspectives (Yale University Press, 1988: p. 8), Moshe Idel notes The first major work devoted to a detailed description of mainly Zoharic Kabbalah and making use of historical, philological, comparative, and conceptual perspectives was Adolphe Franck’s La Kabbale ... Franck’s presentation contributed more to the knowledge of Kabbalah in modern Europe than did any other work prior to the studies of Scholem. The publication data above indicate that Franck’s book has had a wide circulation, and one would rightly infer that it has had a great influence. Chapters 2 and 4 in particular deal with SY. While its appearance preceded much scholarship and many discoveries, Franck’s Kabbalah is still considered a worthy survey and analysis of SY and the Zohar . Franck’s treatment of SY is rational: insightful, even if skeptical. His synopsis is straightforward, supported by quotes from the text itself and by passages from Judah Halevi’s commentary on SY. But now, having been made aware by more recent scholars of the errors of Franck, we are inclined to approach this book more to see how far Franck was able to get than to pursue it as a source of reliable information. Comments: Scholem: These theories in the form in which they have been presented until now—for example, in the widely read book of Adolphe Franck—no longer merit serious scholarly discussion.

Notwithstanding this basic assumption on Franck’s part—which was rejected by subsequent research—he regarded Kabbalah as a uniquely important Jewish phenomenon.... This diagnosis of the role of Kabbalah is strikingly similar to Scholem’s famous perception of the role of Kabbalah as a vital component of Judaism.

London: Theosophical Publishing Company, 1902. b. The Secret Doctrine in Israel. A Study of the Zohar and Its Connections. London: Wm. Rider and Son, 1913. Waite discusses SY at some length in the following sections of The Holy Kabbalah: 1. Book II, Section I: “Date of the Book of Formation” 2. Book III, Section II: “The B ook of Formation” 3. Book III, Section III: “C onnections and Dependencies of the Book of Formation.” In the first section, Waite gives a survey of the issues concerning fixing a date to SY. He defers to his own introduction to Stenring’s translation to provide bibliographic details, yet in the second section he lists editions and translations. In the second section Waite summarizes the text well enough but again he defers to his introduction to Stenring to provide a conclusion as to the value of SY. The third section surveys commentaries on SY, giving the most attention to Saadia’s commentary and, in particular, its connections—or lack of connections—with later Zoharic Kabbalah. Waite then moves into a discussion of Azriel, then, briefly, Nahmanides and pseudo-Eliezer (of Worms). He concludes with a short list of other commentators. Waite includes a translation of The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom and a summary The Fifty Gates of Understanding (pp. 213-219).

( Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , p. 212) The 1906 edition of The Jewish Encyclopedia (vol. XII, pp. 602-8) contains the article “Sefer Yezirah” by Louis Ginzberg.

San Francisco: Straight Arrow Press, 1973. Ponce’s sections of SY may well be the strongest parts of his book, for elsewhere there are numerous errors and omissions. The first segment on SY (pp. 100-111) resides in a discussion of the sefirot ; here we find the first twelve paragraphs of SY in English. Ponce attributes the translation to Westcott. (Though it is similar, it is not the same as the edition used for review above, i.e., the 2 nd ; perhaps Ponce used Westcott’s 1 st edition.) Finally (pp. 157-64), we endure The Thirty-two Paths yet again; Ponce calls his presentation a “compilation of the translation of Westcott, Waite, and Stenring.” Comments: Ponce: There are four modern translations of the Sefer Yetsirah in English: W. Wynn Westcott, Phineas Mordell, Knut Stenring (under the title The Book of Formation ) & Rabbi A. Joseph. The only work that is at all easily available is the translation by Westcott. It includes a translation of The Thirty-two Paths , but those familiar with the original suggest that it is inferior to the other translations of the Sefer Yetsirah . The absence of any adequate edition of the Sefer Yetsirah in English is typical of the state of affairs of Jewish mystical texts in general. While the texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Tantraicism, Shintoism and Sufism are readily available in cheap paper editions, the major texts of Jewish mysticism are mostly untranslated and unpublished.

Scholem was a deep and sympathetic scholar, but one who would not suffer inaccuracy or lubrication. More recent scholars find fault with Scholem’s being long on historiography while short on phenomenology—a criticism always accompanied by acknowledgement of the debt owed Scholem’s work.** Kabbalah.

On pages 23-30, Scholem describes SY and surveys of its historical background. He gives a synopsis of SY’s contents with mention of some general interpretations of the book. He then discusses the problems of dating SY, concluding that it is from the 3 rd to 6 th century. He enumerates the commentaries to SY and concludes with a scan of the printed editions and translations of the text. Origins of the Kabbalah. The Jewish Publication Society/ Princeton University Press, 1987. This English edition is an expansion of the Hebrew work, Reshith ha-Qabbalah (Jerusalem: 1948), “more than double its size”; it was updated to include additional research (of Scholem’s) since 1962 (when a revised version was published in German: Ursprung und Anfange der Kabbala , Berlin: Walter de Gruyter & Co.) drawn from Scholem’s own special interleaved volume, into which he entered notes, queries, corrections, and additions. [French translation: Les origins de la Kabbale , Paris: 1966.] __________ * The Stenring and Rabbi A[kiva ben] Joseph translations mentioned in Ponce’s note are, in fact, one and the same. Further, Stenring’s “tabulation” of The 32 Paths is already based on Waite and Westcott. Ponce missed Kalisch altogether. The note quoted is typical of Ponce: He’ll make a pretty good point, only to undermine it with a serious error.

Elsewhere, Scholem discusses SY’s role in the formation of Kabbalah (pp. 46-8), its influence on the German Hasidim (pp. 97-8), its development as a manual for creating a golem * (pp. 102-3), its links with Merkabah mysticism (117-8), and notes on the commentaries on SY of Joseph ben Shalom (p. 224), Isaac the Blind (pp. 257-8), and Nahmanides (pp. 388-9).

Donnolo was a tenth-century doctor whose medical tracts on herbal prescriptions came to be overshadowed by his cosmological writings, in particular Sefer Hakhmoni . Donnolo brought together Jewish and non-Jewish ideas about astronomy and astrology, but fell short of creating a unified, organized system. Further on Donnolo’s commentary, see Elliot R.

Although we do not understand the main aspects of the circle’s pseudepigraphical framework, its dependence on Sefer Yetzira —without doubt the source of its mystical discourse—is clear and obvious. Chapter 12 discusses “The Commentaries on the Sefer Yetzira by Elhanan ben Yakar.” Dan points out (p. 37) that SY served as the main source of mystical speculation for Sefer ha-Bahir ,* the Iyyun circle,** the Provence school as headed by Rabbi Isaac the Blind, and the Ashkenazi Hasidim.*** ___________ * See Aryeh Kaplan, The Bahir: An Ancient Kabbalistic Text Attributed to Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1979; subsequently reprinted, Northvale: Jason Aronson). ** See Mark Verman, The Books of Contemplation: Medieval Jewish Mystical Sources (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992). *** For references on the Ashkenazi Hasidim, see the source list in my “Notes on the Study of Early Kabbalah in English,” pp. 19-23.

The work is divided into three parts: Part I contains prerequisite philosophical background (in deed, four chapters are borrowed from the Kitab al- Hada’iq of the Muslim thinker al- B atalyusi); Part II is ibn Matut’s running commentary, based upon his philosophical system, on Sefer Yesira (‘The Book of Creation’); and in Part III Samuel presents his system of synthesis of philosophical and kabbalistic thought, discussing, primarily, conceptions of the Divine Being and Its ineffability, the secondary beings / ten sefiroth that emanate therefrom, various realms of existence, the cosmos, the soul, prophecy, divine providence, evil, and the human ability to relate to divinity. Meshobeb Nethiboth , never published, is preserved in manuscripts in two recensions. In my dissertation (in which I trace the relation of the manuscripts to the recensions and the latter to ibn Matut’s subsequent works), I offer a critical edition of the second recension side-by- s ide with an edition of the first recension, annotation, and English translation, as well as a background study of Samuel ibn Matut and his work. In the background study I concentrate on the following areas: 1) Samuel ibn Matut as a popularizer and transmitter of various theosophical traditions, previously the domain of the Jewish Andalusian upper class, to a broader base of Jews in northern Spain; 2) the nature of the intellectual and spiritual life engendered through ibn Matut’s system; and 3) the use of these manuscripts not only as transmitters of the texts, but also - through information gleaned from colophons, orthography, marginalia, stemmata, and the like - as keys for gaining insight into Jewish intellectual and spiritual history in medieval Spain and beyond. • Sendor, Mark Brian.

Volume I is an in-depth discussion of Rabbi Isaac the Blind’s commentary on SY and its milieu; Volume II is an annotated translation of the text. Sendor also offers a neat summary of commentaries on SY in his third chapter, “The Reception of Sefer Yezirah ,” discussing Saadia, Dunash Ibn Tamim, Shabbetai Donnolo, Judah Halevi, and Judah ben Barzilai al-Barceloni.
