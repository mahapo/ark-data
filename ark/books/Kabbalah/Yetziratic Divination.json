Email: mallukh_ahi@hotmail.com - Developers see Page 10 The Cycles of Creation As you might know from my previous writings, I tend to view the creative process in three consecutive phases covering: 1) The development of the Form 2) The awakening and development of Consciousness 3) The conscious integration of Spirit The three phases correspond to the following: According to the Sefer Yetzirah , the Hebrew letter Shin is stationed in Binah and therefore is associated with the Great Mother (i.e. the universal 'form principle'). Binah (and Shin) superintend the evolution of the Form principle which includes the personality aspect of every human - being - consisting of the mental, astral, and physical bodies. Because the Hebrew letter Shin occupies the precise center of the 'master mandala' we have deduced that the ultimate intent of this mandala is the manifestation (or embodiment) of Shin within the Form principle. But in order to achieve this supreme goal there must ensue 21 lesser manifestations which are indicated by the central Hebrew letter in each of the 21 component mandalas that appear on the seven spokes of the master mandala.

It is called the ThK mandala because it is the final mandala of the entire series of 22 mandalas. (See the Introduction for further explanation of the ALBaM code.)

The ThK mandala is therefore a mandala that provides for us the underlying design of the creative process inherent within the master mandala of the Form principle. And it contains the ultimate purpose of this process in Shin at its center. We will therefore call the ThK mandala the 'key mandala' (i.e. in relation to the development of the Form principle). The above diagram shows the positioning of all the component mandalas within the framework of the 'Shin' master mandala. The notation used is based upon the ALBaM code. The spokes are numbered in red from one to seven. Notice that the ThK mandala sits at the center. 0 - A System of Divination - 2 Copyright © 2001. Patrick Mulcahy / AstroQab All rights reserved.

For the purposes of this treatise we will imagine this mandala as representing the various phases of unfoldment of the 'form' principle (or personality aspect) of a human - being. But it is not limited to this application. It can be applied to the systematic manifestation of the 'form aspect' of any 'creation' whatsoever. A System of Divination The master mandala can be used as a system of divination and esoteric knowledge because of its facility to be converted into interlaced cycles of time. 'Divination' is merely the process of perceiving and understanding the 'creative - evolutionary design' that underlies the life cycle of an entity from its beginning to its end, and the master mandala allows us to do this. Cycles Based on the Number Three An Average Human Life - Span Let us say that the master mandala (as a whole) represents a time - span of 73 ½ years (i.e. an average human life - time). We can divide this greater cycle into three 24 ½ year lesser cycles that correspond with the three concentric rings (of seven mandalas each) that are built into the structure of the master mandala, such that... Inner ring = seven '3 ½ year periods' = 24 ½ years Middle ring = seven '3 ½ year periods' = 24 ½ years Outer ring = seven '3 ½ year periods' = 24 ½ years Note : These numbers may seem a little awkward, but please bear with me because it appears that they are the appropriate numbers for us to use with the master mandala. We know that the three concentric rings of the mandala symbolise the process of creation in its three consecutive stages, and that these three correspond to Form, Consciousness, and Spirit. But how does this apply to the development of a human - being? I have briefly explained this elsewhere (in relation to Saturn), but I'll recap the basics... FORM: We might say that the first 24 ½ years of life the form principle is developed in our personal lives. Construction begins from the time of birth from whence our ongoing personal experience of the local environment sets down a foundation of physical, emotional, and mental structures. These structures provide a psycho - physical framework that is the basic foundation for the rest of our lives. Most of the building work occurs as a reaction to our personal physical circumstances - as we interact with our family and friends, and as we undertake our schooling and social programming. Page 1 of 3 A System of Divination - 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CONSCIOUSNESS: During the second 24 ½ year period we learn to express more strongly the consciousness principle. We undertake a process of personal deconstruction and reconstruction so that our lives become a truer reflection of who we are at an individual level. This involves breaking down some elements of the old foundation through a process of psycho - analysis and reintegration, but not necessarily on the couch of a professional counselor. It is usually a case of 'do - it - yourself' psychology involving personal crises followed by reflection and introspection that lead eventually to 'break - throughs' in consciousness. SPIRIT: It is in the third 24 ½ year period that we feel the need to express a deeper level of meaning and purpose in our lives, and this must come from the 'spiritual' dimension. We might feel a 'calling' during this time to devote ourselves to something 'bigger' than ourselves - like the community of our fellow human - beings for instance. As we approach closer and closer to death (and the spiritual realm in general) it is desirable for each of us to establish a comfortable relationship with 'God' and the 'big unknown'. And as we strive to build that relationship the spirit descends to meet us and It permeates our consciousness and our lives with a new kind of energy. So there you have the three basic levels of creative evolution for a human - being. All we now need do is sub - divide these three into seven shorter periods of 3 ½ years each. These 3 ½ year sub - cycles will be associated with one of the 21 smaller mandalas that compose the master mandala - i.e. 21 x 3 ½ = 73 ½ . The 3 - Cycle Table of Calculations The following table is based upon the number 147. It appears that the three concentric rings of the master mandala are meant to be read in the order of their spokes - rather than in the natural numerical ordering of their component mandalas (i.e. 1 to 21). In order to discover the mandala that corresponds with your present 3 ½ year life - phase you need to consult one of the three 'Sub - Cycle' rows below.

Stephen is currently 40 years old. He consults the table above and discovers that his age occurs in the 38 ½ - 41 age sub - cycle of the middle ring.

So Stephen's TR mandala phase began when he turned 38 ½ and will end 3 ½ years following - that is, on his 42nd birthday. Experimentation is required to see whether this methods works accurately as a system of divination. My own experience leads me to believe that it does, but you must be the judge in relation to your own life experience. I would recommend that you concentrate on exploring the meaning and effects of these major 3 - Cycles (as well as the minor 3 - Cycles) before delving into the 7 - Cycles that are described hereafter.

When we divide this time - period by seven we derive the number 10 ½ . So we can divide our lives up into seven 10 ½ year periods that correspond with the seven spokes of the master mandala. What processes does the seven - fold cycle involve? Here is one explanation: Phase I : Causal body - expression (Sun) Phase II : Mental body - expression (Mercury) Phase III : Astral body - expression (Venus) Phase IV : Physical body - grounding & integration (Earth/Moon) Phase V : Astral body - control & refinement (Mars) Phase VI : Mental body - control & refinement (Jupiter) Phase VII : Causal body - control & refinement (Saturn) [See article: The Solar System ] The Major 7 - Cycle Tables Spoke I (Sun) Spoke II (Mercury) Age Cycle (Years) 0 - 10 ½ 10 ½ - 20 Principle Form Consc.

Let us suppose that Stephen turned 40 on the 15th March, 2001. It is now July 31st, 2001. Therefore Stephen is 40 years and 4 months old, and is part way into his 5th month. If we consult the Minor 3 - Cycle table above we will see that Stephen is presently involved in a sub - cycle which is governed by the Hebrew letter Peh (P) on the 5th spoke. In Stephen's case this sub - cycle refers to the time period July 15th - September 15th, 2001. [For interpretative 'key words' for the TR mandala please go here .] It is important when interpreting these mandala influences to also consider the numerology of their seven spokes. For instance, the combined Hebrew letters on the spokes of the TR mandala (imaged above) all reduce to the number eight. Therefore, the numerological meaning of the number eight will provide a major indicator of the energy experienced during the period of its influence. An example of the manifest effects of this number is the fact that soon after I entered the TR life cycle (age 38 ½ - 41 years) I moved into a new residential address - that being 'unit 8, number 8'. This is the first time in my life that I have lived at a 'double 8' address. I moved here when I was 38/7mths old - one month after I entered this TR cycle and well before I received knowledge of these mandalas.

Some of these are based upon the astrological influences of the planets in our solar system as they proceed in their orbits. The measured effects of these astrological cycles have been recorded through the centuries. The cycles that we are exploring in this treatise are based solely upon the geometrical structure of the master mandala. And unlike the astrological cycles some of which effect different people at different times, the mandala cycles are solidly fixed such that their various archetypes effect everybody at precisely the same time of life. But this does not mean that everybody will share exactly the same experience of the archetypes. It is the nature of archetypes to manifest themselves in different forms - forms appropriate to each individual. But those differing forms will all contain in essence the same creative - evolutionary intent. Herein lies the immense value in learning to understand the essential nature of the basic archetypes - they are the 'building blocks' of Creation.. The structure of the master mandala is built upon the number 147. This is basically because: 147 = 49 x 3 147 = 21 x 7 The number 147 is the smallest 'whole number' of years that can be derived from other whole numbers (of days, months, etc) contained within the Master Mandala. Perhaps it is significant then, that it is written in the Old Testament that the most eminent Patriarch 'Jacob' lived for 147 years... Genesis 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. Jacob's name was changed to Israel after he wrestled with an angel and (according to the Zohar) became 'perfect'... Genesis 32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. Genesis 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. Genesis 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. Genesis 32:27 And he said unto him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob. Genesis 32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. Genesis 32:29 And Jacob asked [him], and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. Genesis 32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. Page 1 of 4 A System of Divination - 5 A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"According to the Zohar [171a] the name 'Israel' equates with ' princehood and strength ' and thus (in some sense) indicates the culmination of human spiritual achievement. As it happens, the final (21st) mandala (in the series of mandalas on the spokes of the Master Mandala) contains the word 'Israel' as if to indicate that the closing of the cycle (of 21 mandalas, and 147 years) results in the achievement of a state of consciousness identified by that esteemed name. The 21st Mandala - IShRAL As mentioned earlier, qabalistic Tradition recognises that 'Israel' (Heb: IShRAL) also permutes to 'ISh RLA' meaning ' there are 231 ' which also suggests closure to the series of '231 gates'. So, as the first spoke of the first mandala contains RLA (i.e. the number '231'), correspondingly, the first spoke of the final (21st) mandala contains YShRAL (i.e. 'Israel', or 'there are 231'). Thus, the 147 year life - span of Jacob (also called 'Israel') reflects the 147 year cycle that is built into the structure of the Master Mandala. And both appear to exemplify a cycle of human perfection - which again brings to mind those verses from Psalm 139: Psalm 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made: marvellous [are] thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth right well. Psalm 139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, [and] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Psalm 139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect (Heb: GLMY , lit. ' my golem '); and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of them.

Also, the total number of spokes of all the component mandalas is 147 (excluding the central 'key mandala' of the Master Mandala). The number 147 provides us with other numbers (factors of 147) that are geometrically related to the structure of the mandala, and it is these numbers that are easily converted into relative 'whole number' time cycles. But because 147 is a large number of years in terms of a human life - time, we must halve it to determine the appropriate cycles for a human - being. Thus we derive the number 73 ½ years for an average human life. This effectively means that every Hebrew letter (441 in total) on all the spokes of the 21 component mandalas of the Master Mandala equal two months of time. Here are two tabulations that summarise the major and minor cycles that we have produced using the master mandala. The minor cycles are contained within the major cycles with the smallest cycle being two months.

That is because most people spend most of their time occupied with personality - based issues, and therefore the Shin mandala is most appropriate as an indicator of past, present and future life - trends. But there is another master mandala that maps out for us the developmental cycles of the human soul. We determined that the Shin master mandala governs the activities of the personality because the Hebrew 'mother letter' Shin (according to the Sepher Yetzirah ) is identified with the sefirah Binah and hence with the Form principle of existence. The corresponding mother letter that is associated with the Consciousness principle (and the human soul) is Mem. Its element is 'water' and it is identified with the sephirah Hockmah on the Tree of Life. So it is logical to assume that the evolution of the soul is described by the master mandala that has the Hebrew letter Mem at its center. How can we determine the positioning of the mandalas on the spokes of the Mem master mandala? It is rather simple. All we need do is examine the small mandala that has Mem at its center. Here it is... The NG Mandala The NG mandala is the 'key mandala' of the Mem master mandala. As such, it tells us which Hebrew letters are in process of manifestation on each of the seven spokes of the Mem master mandala. For example, it tells us that the first mandala on the first spoke of the Mem master mandala has the letter Nun at its center. This happens to be the SD mandala.
