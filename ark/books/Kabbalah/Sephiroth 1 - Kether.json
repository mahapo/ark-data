[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"My Qabalah Kether Number 1 Title The Crown Image King God Jehovah, Allah, Brahma Colour White Relationships The Cranium The Dive Spark The Thousand petalled Lotus The First Principle Kether , the first Sephiroth, is the very start of the Tree of Life as it enters our existence. From Kether everything flows down, it is the first spark in our universe. For the Christians it is God almighty, Jewish: Jehovah Buddhists: The Godhead Buddha, Moslems: Allah, Hindus: Brahma, Egyptians: Ra, Greeks: The first Titan, Shamans: The Spirit Medievil: Minerva Everything begins with Kether , and it is the point we ascr ibe to from the bottom of the tree as we ascend the Tree of Life. Kether is in trinity with Tiphareth and Yesod below it. This is the Christian trinity: Father, Son & Holy Ghost. As is said \"The face of the Father is seen reflect ed in the Son through the spirit of the Holy Ghost\" . The Hindu equivalent would be: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.as they represent the same energies. You can plot your religious deities this way also up the centre of the Tree of Life, from Malkuth through Yesod to Tiphareth then ending with Kether The other Trinity for Kether is that of the Supernal Triangle . Where Kether's energy flows right and down to the 2nd Sephiroth Chokmah and then left onto the 3rd Sephiroth Binah This is a Trinity of th e Toaist Yin Yang, where Chokmah is the Yang ( Positive/Male ) and Binah is Yin ( Negative/Female ). These two Se phiroths head the ouside pillars of the Tree of Life and define the energies below them. This Supernal Triangle is unobtainable by we mortal folk. For to get there we would end our earthly existance. Yet we can meditate on the energies and glimpse the power of this Godhead.
