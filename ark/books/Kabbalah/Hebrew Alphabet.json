All of these 22 characters are consonants. (There a re also 16 vowels, indicated by dots and lines danc ing around the consonants.) The number of consonants is augmented by 5 alternat ive forms (Bh/B, Kh/K, Ph/P, S/Sh, Th/T), a dot indicating the less aspirate sound, and by 5 final forms (for Kh, M, N, Ph, Ts). Many of the representations are presumed from those of Old Hebrew, Aramaic, or Phoenician forms, as th e Modern Hebrew forms are much more abstract. Many of the original forms themselves derive from Egyptian hieroglyphic alphabets, probably their hie ratic forms. Kabbalistic origin: The spirit of the name (ShAM) g ave rise to ALPh as air, out of which came MM as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"water, out of which came ShYN as fire; these are th e 3 mother letters. Then were made the 7 doubles (aspirate/unaspirate) to correspond with the heaven ly spheres, and then the 12 simples that correspond to the zodiacal months. [GYML, DLTh, and RYSh were app arently originally doubles. And as ShYN hovers between being a mother and a double, QVPh is both d ouble and simple.] Note that 22 letters divided by 7 doubles is a clos e approximation of pi, the ratio of a circle's circ umference to its diameter, and that 22 plus 7 (plus Q's share of the moon's sphere) is the num ber of days in a lunar month.
