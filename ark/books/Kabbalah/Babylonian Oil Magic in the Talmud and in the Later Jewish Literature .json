When Jacob wanted to hallow the stone at Bethel he poured oil on it (Gen. xxviii. 18). \"When Moses dedicated Aaron to the service of God he poured oil on his head and anointed him (Lev. viii. 12, cf. also Exod. xxix). The Tabernacle and all that was in it was consecrated by being anointed with oil (Lev. viii. 10, n). Lev. x. 7, Moses says to Aaron and his sons: 'And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.' At the cleansing of the leper, too, oil was used. Four verses deal with the use of the oil for that purpose (Lev. xiv. 15-18 ; cf. also vv. 26-9). Every action mentioned in those verses no doubt had its significance. Samuel, when selecting Saul for the kingship, pours oil on his head (i Sam. x. i). When David was chosen by Samuel to succeed Saul he was anointed with oil by Samuel (i Sam. xvi. 13). And so were the later kings anointed with oil, see especially i Kings i ; cf. also Ps. xlv. 8. In Assyria, too, memorial stones and tablets were anointed with oil. So Tiglath-Pileser I (end of twelfth century B.C.E.) says : naru P L sd Samsi- # Ramman a-bi- ia samne ap-su-us, ' the memorial stones of my ancestor Samsi-Ramman I have anointed with oil ' (col. viii, 47- 48). See, for more references, Delitzsch, Assyrisches Handworterbuch, p. 550. In Egypt and Greece also oil was used for dedication ; see Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible, Vol. I, p. 101. Oil also played a role in magic. We know this from Assyro-Babylonian magical texts. In the Ritualtafeln A 2"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 BABYLONIAN OIL MAGIC published by Zimmern 1 oil is mentioned several times as an important element in magic. In old Babylonian texts, published by J. Hunger, 2 we find divination by means of oil. \"What importance there was ascribed to oil in Babylonian magic can also be seen from the following passage occurring in one of the incantations of the Maklu texts published by Tallqvist 3 : szptu samnu ellu samnu ib-bu samnu nam-ru samnu mu-lil-li sa Hani amnu mu-pa-as-si-i$ ^bu-a-na sa a-me-lu-ti saman sipti sa '* E-a saman sipti sa Marduk u-da-fri-id-ka saman tap-su-uJi-ti sd il E-a id-di-nu a-na pa-as-ha-a-ti ap-su-us-ka saman baldti addika.

The parallels are striking, not only with regard to the use of the oil, but also with regard to the ceremonies and formulas connected with it. It will be seen that the Babylonian and Jewish documents supple- ment and throw light on each other. The passages re- ferring to oil in magic in the Talmud are very few and fragmentary. It will be seen how they become clear and intelligible with the help of the Babylonian texts as well as the later Jewish documents. I will deal first with the Talmudic passages (A) and then with the later Jewish texts (B). These later texts I divide into two groups : (i) one group (B i) consist- ing of those texts in which oil is used in course of the divination ceremony as a part of the ceremony so that the spirits may appear in the thumb-nail or in the hand or in the vessel and may be seen through the oil (}K>W '\"it?, 1-7); (2) the second group (62) consisting of texts in which the whole divination is made practically through the oil only, as through the formation of the oil (8) or through the reflection or non-reflection in the oil (9, 10). Text 1 1 does not strictly belong to this group. But in this text, too, the use of oil is important. We find that oil also played a role in Egyptian magic. The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leyden, published by Griffith and Thompson, are full of oil divina- tion, and contain many striking parallels to Babylonian magical texts as well as to the Jewish texts published here. 1 There can be no doubt that this form of magic came to the Egyptians from the land of the Euphrates. The following passage from the papyrus mentioned will help to show clearly the Babylonian origin of Egyptian oil magic : [The spell] which you say to the oil to put it on the sting daily : ' Isis sat reciting to the oil Abartat and lamenting (?) to 1 Cf. Griffith and Thompson, I.e., pp. 21-33, 35> 49.

It is Isis who makes invocation to the oil ' (see Griffith and Thompson, I.e., p. 131, lines 17-22). These lines read as if they were formed on the passage from Maklu, quoted above (p. 4), and show unmistakably the Babylonian origin of Egyptian oil magic. In Europe, too, oil has been known as a means of magical manipulations ; of., e. g., lines 129-30 in Coleridge's The Ancient Mariner : 1 The water, like a witch's oils, burnt green, and blue, and white.' The influence of the culture of the land of the two rivers upon the development of mankind has been very great, but not the least great has it been in the domain of magic and witchcraft. The more one examines the ancient literature the more one sees how the various forms of Sumero-Babylonian superstition spread to the whole of the ancient civilized world, and how many of these superstitions have survived up to the present day in East and \"West."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A. PASSAGES FROM THE TALMUD. IN Talmud Babli, Sanhedrin ioi a , the following Baraitha is quoted : 'aao ^N fra bixa>i> pm x> }t? by pK>rr6 pro top jot?

It is clear that we have in this Baraitha the use of oil in magic. In the first case (fiOB> nt?, &c.) oil is used for divination purposes (jrn he6). In the second case the oil is used for ' whispering a charm ', puril^, for magical healing. How the oil was used by the diviner the Baraitha does not state. Neither is it clear what l| lt? means. Rashi explains that it refers to magical work with oil and that |Bt? nt? mean JiTD \"nt? (' the princes of the thumb '). But this does not add much to our under- standing of the Baraitha. In fact, the phrase )t? nB> (as well as D'jra nts>) appeared so obscure that some MSS. have <W or *vv* The Aruch (ed. Kohut, Vol. VIII, p. 161) translates nc? by ' princes '.

This is, however, unlikely. 2 See Rabbinowicz, op. cit., Sanhedrin, p. 306. Cf. also the attempt at explanation made by L. Goldschmidt in his translation of Sanhedrin, p. 443, note 530."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 BABYLONIAN OIL MAGIC Rashi, it can be also seen that the real meaning of the Baraitha was by no means clear to those who attempted to explain it. We will see later how the late Jewish documents throw full light on this Baraitha. At present we will see what the Babylonian ' Ritual Tablets ' yield for the understanding of this passage. Hit., pp. 196-7, iii, opens with the following lines: (2) il Samas bel di-nim il Adad bel bi-ri anasi-k[u-mi-*i a-kar-rab-ku-nu-s{] (3) samna ella samna mar il A-nim samna mar il Ba ... ' (2) ama, lord of the judgement, Hadad, lord of the divination ! I bring to y[ou, I dedicate to you] (3) pure oil, oil, a child of Anu, oil, a child of Ea . . .' This prayer of the baru is concluded in lines 13-14 : (13) ina qiblti-jd ms qati-jd ina mim-ma ma-la eppusu (-su) (14) ta-mit a-kar-ra-bu ina imni-su u sume- li-su ket-ta lib-si.

Here we clearly have a case of divination by oil. Although it seems, according to 1. i6 b and 1. 18, that it speaks here of lecanomancy, it must be inferred from 1. 2 b , 1. 3, 1. 17, and 1. 19 that the object was not only to get to know the future happenings from the formations of the oil (see below), but also and perhaps mainly from the gods themselves by means of the oil. Therefore, whether }B> in |{? ns? refers to lecanomancy or whether it refers which is more probable to a different use of the oil (see below), to ask of the }E> nc? means to inquire of the princes (the gods, the demons) through using oil what the future will bring or to ask them to fulfil a certain wish.

That the \\a& np often ' lied ' (p3T3BB> ^BID), even those who believed in those super- stitious acts will have known, as the ceremonies connected with those acts were so numerous and had to be most scrupulously and faithfully performed, and the least error brought about failure. JFor this reason the diviner prayed that he might be saved from mistakes, cf. 11. 13-14 of the quoted 'ritual tablet', also Hunger, I.e., p. I5- 2 1 See Zimmern, 1. c., note d. It means, perhaps, ' the making abundant of the heart '. 2 In the case of D^IPQ HB' eggs were used for the purpose of divination. We see from this that a magical influence similar to that of oil was ascribed to the egg, and that the egg was used for various magical purposes. Thus we also read in Hilprecht's Excavations in Assyria and Babylonia, of eggs which were concealed under incantation-bowls.

The Baraitha says that the whispering of the charms is done over oil in a vessel. The same thing we find in the Babylonian ' Ritual Tablets'. Cf. Rit., pp. 104-5, * ZI 7 : ma ^ a ^ a amsl ^ aril u-Jcan, 'the makaltu-vessel the diviner shall put (in its proper place)'. This makaltu was used for oil (and water) ; cf. Zimmern, I.e., p. 85 and p. 89. Cf. also Rit. } pp. 114-15, 1. 20, where the makaltu is mentioned, and pp. 118-19, ! 2 4 where the b&ru is called mukin makalti elli-te, 'he who puts down the sacred (divining) vessel'. Cf. also pp. 174-5, ! 9 : [* ar *' a ^ lcal-l\\u sam\\ne me tumalli- ma,' ' a kallu-vessel thou shalt fill with oil and water ', and pp. 176-7, 11. 41-2 : (41) \\Tc\\ar-ri-s\\u ]d samne me sd ina karpat Jcal-U (42) amsl zammaru a-na m\\ahar (?) m]ajali u-qar-rab' ' The mixture of oil and water, which is in the kallu-vessel, the singer shall bring before (?) the bed.' Through these Babylonian parallels it seems, by the way, to become clear that the Baraitha does not refer to hen's egg, which was concealed under the bowl ', ' is probably to be regarded as a sacrifice to those demons to appease their wrath and check their evil influence'. P. 368, we read of 'a well-preserved goose-egg' that was found in the mortar of the Parthian palace. References to eggs in connexion with magic are also made in the Stoord of Moses, ed. Gaster, p. xiii, 1. 33, p. xv, 1. 16, p. xvii, 1. 6 and 1. 24, p. xix, 1. 14, and p. xxvi, 1. 9, and in Thompson's 'Folklore of Mossoul', PSBA., 1906, p. 100, Nos. 25, 31, 35, and 1907, p. 167, Nos. 17 and 29. The passage in Talmud Babli, Aboda Zara 46* (cf. also Jerush. A. Z., ch. 3, 43*, ed. Krotoschin, see also 53*), rh minnBTI^ niTQ P)pt, could, perhaps, be explained better now. Having had a magical power, and having been regarded as effective against evil spirits, the egg may have also been made an object of worship. By the way, that the belief in the ' princes of the eggs ' is still alive, and that eggs are still used for superstitious purposes, the following quotation shows. In the Daily News and Leader of May i, 1913, the reviewer of My Past by Countess Marie Larisch quotes the following passage from that book : ' The Empress (Elisabeth of Austria) was very superstitious, and occasionally, when I had exhausted the gossip of Vienna, she would make me put the white of an egg into a glass of water, and together we would try to read omens in the shapes which it took.'

The last sentence of the Baraitha is probably to be understood in this way : because one whispers the charm over oil in the vessel and not over oil in the hand, one does anoint oneself with the oil -from the hand, but one does not anoint oneself with the oil from the vessel, as oil used for magical pur- poses must not be used for any other purpose. It may also be that magical oil was supposed to be injurious. Of interest is also the following passage in Talmud Jerushalmi, Shabbath, ch. xiv, 3 (ed.

References to the magical power of oil are also to be found in Talmud Babli, Shabbath io b and 66 b . From the Talmudic passages adduced here it is clear that the use of oil in divination, as well as in other kinds of magic, was known to the Jews in the time of the Talmud. The Babylonian parallels make it -equally clear that the use of oil in magic was of Babylonian origin and that the Jews took it over from the Babylonians. We will see later that the Babylonians practised oil magic as long back as 2OooB.c.E. The Ritual Tablets, although coming from the library of Aurbanipal, no doubt also go back to that time. There can be no doubt therefore as to the Babylonian origin of these magical practices. To the Babylonians again these practices came from the Sumerians. What concerns us now, how- ever, is that the Jews in the time of the Talmud made the same use of oil for magical purposes and performed the same ceremonies as the Babylonians. The examina- tion of the later Jewish documents and the adducing of their Babylonian parallels will make the Baraitha in Sanhedrin still clearer and will show how much in- formation there has been preserved in that short Talmudic passage."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"B.

'the princes of the thumb' that the thumb plays an important part in this divination. Then we learn (1. 2) that the diviner has to make very thin the nail of the right thumb of the lad, that he has to anoint this his nail (and his forehead) with pure olive oil (1. 4), and that the lad has to look at his nail (1. 5). The spirits that are to bring the king Mimon are called pte nt? ' princes of the nail ' (1. 7). The king Mimon has to be brought in that nail (nr piava, 1. 8). And when he wishes that they (the king and queen) should go away, the lad has to take off the oil from hjs nail (and his fore- head, 11. 10-11). It is thus clear that a great magical power is ascribed to the nail of the thumb, if prepared, anointed, and looked at in the proper, prescribed way. The very bringing of the spirits is possible only through the nail. And it is only natural that this prescription should be called ' the princes of the thumb(-nail) '. Now, this 'thumb-nail' is also to be found in the Baby- lonian magical literature. In Rit. there occurs three times the phrase bel supur ubani annie, p. no (b), 1. 3, p. 216, 1. 44, and p. 218, 1. 2. The last passage leaves no doubt as to whom this phrase refers, namely, to the baru, the diviner. Why is the bdrii called bel supur ubani annie? Zimmern translates : 'der, von dem dieses Nagel- zeichen herriihrt', and remarks in a footnote (p. 1 1 1, note b) : 'Bezieht sich wohl auf eine Tafel, auf welcher die Anfrage an das Orakel aufgezeichnet wurde, und auf welcher der Betreffende, wie auf den sog. Kontrakttafeln, seinen Fingernagel an Stelle eines Namenssiegels eindriickte.' This explanation is unsatisfactory. Why should the tablet be called ' finger-nail ' ? And even if this were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"LATER JEWISH TEXTS 29 so, what sense does it give? It is obvious from the note of Professor Zimmern that he also felt the difficulty. Now, I have no doubt that bel supur ubdni annie is to be translated ' the master of the nail of this finger ', and that the whole phrase is a designation for the bdru. \"Why ? Because the baru divined by means of his finger-nail in the way shown in these Jewish texts. How important the nail-function was we see from the fact that on p. no the bdru is called only bel supur ubdni annie. The bdru divines by ' looking' at shining objects (cf. below, p. 31). Divining by means of the finger-nail with all that belongs to it is therefore originally Babylonian. The bdru most probably used his own nail. But even had he used a boy as a medium, as he no doubt did at times, he would have been called bel supur ubdni annie, as he, as the magician, had the power over the nail. It is thus quite obvious that the fro nK> were of Babylonian origin. 1 It is probable that piav \"HP represented certain ' princes ' that had their origin in the Babylonian pantheon and perhaps adopted in the course of time, in the minds .of the Jewish magicians, vaguer forms (perhaps of angels and spirits in general) ; cf. also the following notes. Now there can be no doubt that these |m 1 nB> are included in the jK> ne> mentioned in the Talmud (see above, pp. 7ff.). }E> 'ItJ' was the general name for the various ' princes ' invoked by means of oil-magic. In the texts published here we have fro np, ep ntP, Dtt np, and 1 It would be tempting to say that bel supur ubdni annie meant ' the lord of this finger-nail ' and represented a spirit . thus being the exact equivalent of }fQ IKt. But in view of the context (see especially Bit., p. 218, 1. 2) this seems impossible. According to the interpretation given above, the ' princes of the finger-nail ' are, of course, presupposed in the Babylonian divination, as we know now, through the Jewish texts, what role the nail played in divination. Another question is whether ubanu in the passages in Eit. means ' finger ' generally or ' thumb '. The word Ji\"O in this text would almost indicate that ubanu means here ' thumb '. This would support the theory that ubanu meant originally only ' thumb ' (cf. Schrader , Zeitschr. f. Assyriol., I, pp. 460-1)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"30 BABYLONIAN OIL MAGIC nhna ne>. All these ' princes ' had the general name of pe ne>. It is worthy of note that Rashi actually explains ?DU> ne> by p3 HB>.

We see from this that Rashi (eleventh century) knew of the existence of magical work through }ra ntJ>. That Rashi was fully acquainted with the meaning of jra ns?, and the details of those magical performances, we also see from a remark in his commentary on Sanhedrin 6y b . Commenting on the saying of Abayya TDpn it? WEN, Rashi says : \"OT nwj fo uw \"^an by Tspne> *v inps? p3D panra* |nn nt? jwa nil mi^ ^is-in ^3 s^n B' ma panvi? 012 n^ 'He who is particular about the vessel (by means of which he divines), that he cannot do anything without the vessel that is required for that thing, as, for instance, the \" princes of the thumb \", for which they require a knife, the handle of which is black, or the '' princes of the cup \", that they require a cup of glass.' ' A knife, the handle of which is black,' exactly as in our text ! For the ' princes of the cup ' see text 7. It is interesting to see that Rashi, who lived more than half a millennium before the time of the manuscript of this text, uses the same words as employed in this prescription. ' Thumb ' magic is also mentioned by D. Kimhi (twelfth and thirteenth centuries) in his com- mentary on Ezekiel.

It is clear from this passage that Kimhi knew all about thumb-nail magic. He also tells us distinctly why the nail was used for these divination purposes: because of its brightness. The nail has a bright surface, and when well polished and prepared (see this text, 1. 2) its brightness is increased, and because of its brightness the diviner can look well into it and ' see ' the spirits. The same reason applies to the other objects of divination, as iron, mirror, liver, or glass cups and bdellium. It is important to know this, as it helps us to explain the meaning of the word DDp (' to look-at certain objects' ,' to divine by looking-at certain objects' ); see my article 'Die Bedeutung von DDp' in the forthcoming Festschrift in honour of David Hoffmann. This note makes it clear that the thumb-nail divination which was common in Babylonia 2,000 years before the common era (see for the date of the ' Ritual Tablets ', Zim- mern, I.e., p. 82, also above, p. 12) was in vogue among Jews in the times of the Talmud as well as in the time of Rashi and Kimhi and was still practised in the seventeenth cen- tury. It is still being practised in the Orient at the present time ; cf. Thompson, PSBA., 1906, pp. 84-5, where the description of a thumb-nail divination ceremony wit- nessed by the writer is given. Thus we see how magical practices wander from generation to generation almost untouched by the hand of time. Thumb-nail magic can, as we see, look back upon a period of 4,000 years. 1 1 The custom of looking at the nails during the prayer of Habdalah at the outgoing of Sabbath (see Shulhan 'Arukh, Orah Hayyim, ch. 298, 3 ;"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"32 BABYLONIAN OIL MAGIC ypnp2 i>uy new ' and make a circle in the earth '. The magical circle was indispensable, as it was supposed to protect the magician from attacks from the spirits. For details about the magical circle, see Thompson, Semitic Magic, pp. Iviii ff. \"What the use of the circle was we can see from a ' blessing ' quoted by Thompson, I.e., p. Ix. After referring to the work of mysteries to be begun the magician pronounced the following ' blessing' : ' We, therefore, in the names aforesaid, consecrate this piece of ground for our defence, so that no spirit whatsoever shall be able to break the boundaries, neither be able to cause injury nor detriment to any of us here assembled, but that they may be compelled to stand before this circle and answer truly our demands.' This protective circle we also find already in Babylonian magic; see Thompson, I.e., p. Iviii; cf. also Rit., p. 192, 1. 46 and 1. 58. This passage may be quoted : il Samas see also the compendium on festival and other ritual laws by Isaac ibn Ghayyat nth century published by I. D.

The attribution of magical powers to the nails and the supposed appearance of spirits in them may also be the reason for the old prohibition of throwing away the parings of the nails (see Talmud Babli, Mo'ed Katan 18 a, and Niddah 17 a). The reason mentioned in the Talmud is probably only a secondary one, which again may be connected with the reason given here. The accident to the pregnant woman (see T. B., 1. c.) was probably supposed to have been caused through the wrath of the ' princes of the nail '. Various other customs with regard to the cutting of the nails (as the days on which and the order in which they should be cut ; see Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. IX, p. 149) have probably also their last cause in nail magic. So may, for instance, on certain days the cutting of the nails have been regarded as being less harmful because on those days the nail-spirits may have been supposed to have less power of inflicting injury on the person. The same may have applied to the order of the nails to be cut. If the nails were cut in a certain order the demons had no power to do harm. All this would tend to show how deep-rooted nail magic was, and what an importance there was ascribed to the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"LATER JEWISH TEXTS 33 bel di-nim * 7 Adad bel bi-ri u-qat-tar-Jcu-nu-si '? erina ella Jci-is-ra sil-ta za-'-a taba Jci-is-rat *'? erini elli na-ram Hani rabuti usurtu ilu-ti-ku-nu rabl-ti u-qat-tar sa-ba-a *> erina erina lis-bu-ma qat-ra-a Hani rabuti a-na di-ni da-a-ni ta-as-ba-a-ma di-ni di-na il Samas u il Adad i-ziz-za-nim- ma ina qibUi-jd nls qdti-jd ina mim-ma ma-la eppusu(-su) ta-mit a-Jcar-ra-bu Jcet-ta lib-si (11. 56-61).

We thus see that the gods of divination are asked to enter the circle (usurtu), to sit down there and then to deliver judgement.

We thus see that the Babylonian usurtu is the later Jewish I'ljy. That the 'circle' was an important element in the ceremony we also see from the fact that the miracle- worker Honi mentioned in Talmud Babli, Ta'anit 19* and 23* ff, was called i>3j?, 'the circle-maker', after the circle which he used to make and in the midst of which he used to stand when he adjured God to grant his request and to cause rain to fall.

(1. 73).' 4 Another reference to these stones is made in 1. 104 (I.e., p. 58). We thus see that to these four stones a certain magical power is ascribed. No doubt the four smooth stones in our text stand in some connexion with the four stones in the Babylonian incantation. Various kinds of stones are also mentioned, together with oil, honey, and butter, in Rit., p. 138, lines 2-4, as necessary ingredients for the ceremony of the dsipu; cf. also p. 112, 1. 12, and p. 116, 1. 28.

As ~int2>n nicy stands for nn&J> so here &wn niy stands for wav. t?wn *ny vsb thus certainly means ' before the rise 1 of the sun '. From this we see that the ceremony had to be performed early in the morning before sunrise. Exactly as in the Babylonian divination. In Bit. we read several times that the various offerings, which were a part of the divination ceremony, had to be offered and the various other preparations had to be made before the rise of the sun ; cf.

It is interesting to note that the Jews did not take over the magical prayers from the Babylonians. This would have clearly been against their monotheism, and they substi- tuted their own psalms and hymns. They could adopt the obscure magical ceremonies and formulae, of the real (religious) meaning of which they were not quite con- scious. But they could not plainly worship SamaS and Marduk; see also the following note. For fuller notes on the use of psalms as spells see below, p. 41 f.

This is a very interesting line. What is the tt ? and what are the nn: rvihv ? There can be no doubt that DTI represents Ea, who plays a great role in Babylonian magic ; see Rit, p. 98, 1. 42 ; p. 158, 1. 4 ; p. 160, 1. 4, and passim. The Jam-knowledge is called nisirti Anim Bel u Ea ' the secret of Anu, Bel, and Ea ' (see Rit., p. 89). Wherever Ea is mentioned together with Samas and Marduk Ea is mentioned in the first place ; see Rit., p. 158, 1. 4, and p. 160, 1. 4 and 1. 13. Cf. also &urpu in Zimmern's Beitr. z. Kenntnis d. bab.

Ea was the god of the deep sea. And instead of saying Ea the Jews said ' the sea '. The real meaning of it was, as it were, made obscure. DTI is therefore Ea. The ' three lights ', nn: IJtfav, no doubt represent the three Babylonian gods, Sin (the moon), Samas (the sun), and Marduk (also the sun). 1 Samas and Marduk played a great role in Babylonian magic; see Rit., passim. 1 See KAT.', p. 370."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"LATER JEWISH TEXTS 37 And Sin is also found in connexion with magical cere- monies and prayers ; cf., e.g., Bit., p. 128, 1. I ; p. 140, 1. 10. Sin is also called bel purusse ' the lord of the decision of the oracle ' ; see KA T. z , p. 362. So we have in this text, in a disguised form, four Babylonian gods: Ea, Sin, &amas, and Marduk. Cf. Rit., p. 140, 11. 10-11, where these four gods are mentioned in the same order, only with the addition of Adad before Marduk. Line 8. Mimon, no doubt the name of a principal 'spirit', perhaps also represents some Babylonian deity. His ' queen ' reminds us of A-a, the consort of oamas (see Rit., p. 102, 1. 104). His ' two servants ' remind us of Bunene, ' the messenger (suJcJcal) of Sanaas\" and A-a ' (ibid., 1. 105). The lines which follow, and in which we read of the slaughtering of two lambs and of preparing them, of bringing three cups (of wine ?), of placing a table in the slaughter-house, and of inviting them (the ' gods ') to eat and to drink, have their striking parallels in the Baby- lonian divination ritual ; cf. Rit., pp. 98-110, and passim. There we have the same ceremonies with much fuller details. The following passage may be quoted : ina ba-lu qlsti u Jcdt-ri-e mar amU bare a-sar di-ni Id i-te-ih-hi { ? erina la inassi(-si] ta-mit pi-ris-ti ul i-ta-mu-su. 'Without gift and offering the diviner shall not come near the place of judgement, (otherwise) they do not announce to him the secret utterance' (p. 104, 11. 117-19). All those offerings were therefore a necessary part of the ceremony, whether performed by the Babylonian bdru or the Jewish diviner. 1 Line n. nya^n nao was no doubt the book in which all the magical prescriptions were contained.

For the reason of taking a small boy or girl for divination purposes, see Halliday, Greek Divination, p. 161. There can be no doubt that the innocence and purity of the child were supposed to make him or her a more effective medium. In the pregnant woman it was no doubt the unborn child that was the main factor. Lines 3-5. Of. Rit., p. 170, 11. 12-13: a-na libbi uzne imni-siL u sumeli-su III-ta-a-an tu-lah-hds.

In the Babylonian texts sometimes oil is poured on water and sometimes water on oil : cf. 1. c., p. 18. For very close parallels, cf. especially A 32-6 (p. 42), and 72 (p. 48), and B 10-14 (pp. 48-50). One or two paragraphs may be quoted. A 34 : samnum me-e i-na na-di-e-ka ip-ru-us-ma i-tu-ur a-ve-lum U-im-ra-as li-is-ta-ni-ih i-ba-lu-ud.

' If the oil, when I pour it on water, sinks down, seizes the bottom of the cup and does not go up (again), the sick person will die; the troops who have gone in the campaign will not return.' In B 10 we have, exactly as in our text, divination through pouring oil on water and through observing whether it sinks to the bottom without going up again, or rises again to the surface. For the sticking together of the oil-drops (rns'an ipmj) B 14 is interesting. In any case our text presents a striking example of the longevity of Babylonian superstition. It reads almost like a paragraph from the Old Babylonian oil-divination texts translated into Hebrew. TEXT 9. In this text we have another form of divination by means of oil.

In this text we have the same mode of divination as in the previous text. TEXT ii. Lines 1-2. We find that oil mixed with water was used among the Jews in Babylonia about 1000 c. E. for anointing a mourner at the end of the seven days of mourning. There, too, various Biblical verses were recited over the cup of oil and water. See Bamberger, op. cit., Part II, p. 74 (quotation in Ibn-Ghayyat from a responsum of the Gaon Hai) ; see also J. Miiller, op. cit., p. 253. For the use of oil and water in connexion with magic, see also the Sword of Moses, p. xiii. This text is of special interest because of the use made in it of psalm- verses. We know that the Bible was used for magical purposes ; see Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. Ill, p. 202 ff. The most favoured book in that direction was the book of Psalms ; see 1. c., also Vol. X, p. 204 f. Books were written which contained prescriptions as to how the psalms were to be used for magical purposes (&>lK> D^nn). For an extract of the D^nn JWOP, see l.c., p. 203 f. We also know that the Christians made the same use of the Psalms ; cf. Kayser, ' Der Gebrauch von Psalmen zur Zauberei ' in ZDMG., Vol. XLII, p. 456 ff. But from the cuneiform inscriptions we learn now that this custom al- ready prevailed among the Babylonians. The Babylonians made constant use of hymns and psalms in incantations. As a matter of fact, most of the Babylonian hymns and psalms have come down to us as parts of incantations. For the use of Babylonian psalms as incantations, see, e.g., Bit., p. 126 f. and p. 132 f.
