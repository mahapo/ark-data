[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Introduction The laws of nature, our place in the world and our behavior have been studied by scientists and philos ophers for thousands of years. Along with logical assumptions, science uses quanti fiable research and data. Yet our scientists and re searchers have discovered that the more they advance in their rese arch, the more obscure and confusing they find the world to be. Science has undoubtedly brought enormous progress i nto the world, yet it is limited. Scientific tools cannot measure man’s inner world, his soul, behavior and sources o f motivation. Man, the major component of the creat ion, is still left without knowledge about his role in this unive rse. Man has always looked for answers to the basic ques tions of life: Who am I? What is the purpose of my being here? Why does the world exist? Do we continue to exist a fter our physical being has completed its tasks? In this world of constant pressure, some find tempo rary satisfaction in Eastern techniques, measures a imed at relaxation, or reducing suffering by minimizing per sonal expectations and desires. Various forms of me ditation, nutrition, and physical and mental exercise quiet m an’s natural instincts and enable him to feel more comfortable from the point of view of his physical state. This process teaches him to lower his expectations, yet leaves him in conflict with his true desires. Our life experience teaches us that we have unlimit ed desires – and only limited resources to satisfy them. This is the primary reason there is no way to completely sa tisfy all our desires and therefore avoid suffering . That is the subject of Kabbalah. Kabbalah answers the basic que stions of life and guides us toward achieving unlim ited satisfaction on a daily basis. The essential questions of man’s being add another dimension to human suffering. They do not allow us to feel satisfied even when this or that goal has been fulf illed. When one attains the goal he strives for, he immediately feels he’s missing yet another pleasure. This prevents hi m from enjoying his achievements, and his suffering is renewed. In retrospect, he sees that he has spent most of hi s time making an effort to achieve his goals, and h as gained very little pleasure from the successes themselves. Everyone, each in his own way, tries to answer thes e questions from the sources of information at his disposal. Each one of us formulates our own perception of the worl d based on our experience. Reality and everyday lif e constantly put this perception to the test, making us react, i mprove, or otherwise change it. With some of us, th is process occurs on a conscious level; with others it happens uncons ciously. Kabbalah reaches out to all those who are seeking a wareness. It teaches you how to add an essential fe eling of the spiritual sphere – the sixth sense – that will affe ct your life in this world. This will allow you to perceive the upper world – the Creator – and to gain control over your life. The Bible, The Zohar, The Tree of Life and other au thentic spiritual sources were set down in order to teach us how to progress in the spiritual realms, to study them and to receive spiritual knowledge. They explain ho w to set out on a path to spiritual ascent in this world. Over the generations, Kabbalists have written many books in various styles, each in accordance with the era in which they lived . In total, four languages were created to introduce us to our spiritual reality: the language of the Bi ble (which includes the Five Books of Moses, the Prophets and the Scriptures), the language of legends, a legalis tic language, and the language of Kabbalah, which describes the s piritual upper-worlds system and how to reach it. T he differences in languages simply present various per spectives on the same subject in different formats – each suiting the generation it was intended for. The Kabbalist Baal HaSulam writes in his book Fruit s of the Wise: The inner wisdom of Kabbalah is the same as that of the Bible, The Zohar and the legends, with the onl y difference between them being the manner of the log ic. It is rather like an anci ent tongue translated into four languages. It is self- evident that the wisdom itself did not change at al l due to the change in language. All we need to consider is which is most convenient and widely accepted for conveyance. By reading this book, you will be able to take your first steps in understanding the roots of human be havior and the laws of nature. The contents present the essential principles of the Kabbalistic approach and describe the wisdom of Kabbalah and the way it works. A Guide to the Hidden Wisdom of Kabbalah is intended for those searching for a sensible and reliable method of studying the phenom ena of our world, for those seeking to understand t he reasons for suffering and pleasure, for those seeking answe rs to the major questions of life. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Part I The Need for Kabbalah in Our Daily Lives Chapter 1: What Is Kabbalah? Kabbalah is an accurate method to investigate and d efine man’s position in the universe. The wisdom of Kabbalah tells us the reason why man exists, why he is born, why he lives, what the purpose of his life is, whe re he comes from and where he is going after he completes his l ife in this world. Kabbalah is a method of reaching the spiritual worl d. It teaches us about the spiritual world, and by studying it, we develop another sense. With the help of this sense we can be in touch with the upper worlds. Kabbalah is not a theoretical study, but a very pra ctical one. Man learns about himself, who he is, wh at he is like. He learns what he needs to do to change himself stage by stage and step by step. He conducts his research through his inner self. All experimentation is conducted on himself, within himself. That is why Kabbalah is called “The Hidde n Wisdom.” Through Kabbalah a person undergoes internal change s that only he feels and knows are taking place. Th is activity occurs within a person; it is unique to him, and on ly he knows about it. The word Kabbalah comes from the Hebrew word lekabbel , to receive. Kabbalah describes the motives of act ions as “the desire to receive.” This desire refers to rece iving various kinds of pleasure. In order to receiv e pleasure, a person is usually willing to invest great effort. T he question is, how can one attain the maximum amou nt of pleasure while paying a minimum price for it? Everyone tries to answer this question in his own way. There is a certain order to the way the desire to r eceive develops and grows. In the first stage, man lusts after physical pleasure. Then he seeks money and honor. A n even stronger desire makes him thirst for power. He may later develop a desire for spirituality, which is a t the peak of the pyramid. A person who recognizes how great his desire for spirituality begins to seek ways of sati sfying this desire. The passage through the stages of the desire to rec eive makes a person become familiar with his abilit ies and limitations. Kabbalah deals with the upper worlds, the roots of our feelings and thoughts, which we cannot grasp. S ince we have no control over the worlds, we do not know how and why our feelings and thoughts are created. We wonde r at experiences such as sweet, bitter, pleasant, rough and so forth. We are unsuccessful at building scien tific tools to examine our feelings, even in the field of psycholo gy, psychiatry and other social disciplines. Behavi oral factors remain hidden from our understanding. Kabbalah is a system for scientifically evaluating our feelings: It takes the total of our feelings an d desires, and provides an exact scientific formula for each and e very phenomenon, at each level, for every type of u nderstanding and feeling. This is the work of feelings combined with intellec t. It uses, for beginning students, geometry, matri ces and diagrams. When studying Kabbalah, they recognize ea ch of their own feelings and begin to understand it . They know what name it should be given according to its power, direction and character. The wisdom of Kabbalah is an ancient and proven met hod. Through it, man can receive higher awareness a nd attain spirituality. This is really his goal in this world . When a person feels a desire for spirituality, he starts to feel a longing for it, and can then develop the desire thr ough the wisdom of Kabbalah that has been provided by the Creator. Kabbalah is a word that describes the aim of the Ka bbalist: to attain everything man is capable of, as a thinking being, the highest of all creatures. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Why Study Kabbalah? When an ordinary person studies the writings of the Kabbalists, he learns about what was formerly hidd en from him. Only after acquiring the sixth sense through study does he begin to feel and see what was previously u nrevealed. Everyone has a natural ability to develop this sixt h sense, and that is the reason Kabbalists transmit their knowledge of the structure of the upper, spiritual world. [Se e the chapter on “Sensing Reality Through Kabbalah. ”] When a person is exposed to Kabbalistic materials, he may not at first grasp what he is reading. But i f he wants to understand, and tries to do so in the proper manner , he invokes what is called the Surrounding Light, the light that corrects him; and very gradually he is shown his sp iritual reality. The terms “to correct” and “correc tion” are used in Kabbalah to describe a change in the desire to rece ive, i.e., to acquire the qualities of the spiritua l world and of the Creator. Everyone has this sixth, still-dormant spiritual se nse; this is called the point of the heart. Opposit e it stands the light, which will eventually fill the point, the sixth sen se, when it develops. The sixth sense is also called the spiritual Vessel ( Kli ), and it continues to exist even without material reality. The spiritual Vessel of the ordinary person who has nev er studied Kabbalah is not sufficiently developed t o feel the spiritual world. When he studies the original Kabba lah writings in the proper way, this light enlighte ns the point of the heart and begins to develop it. The point then begins to widen and it expands sufficiently to allo w the Surrounding Light to enter it. When the light enter s into the point of the heart, it gives a person a spiritual feeling. This point is the person’s soul. Nothing is possible without help from the upper wor ld, without the Surrounding Light descending from a bove and gradually lighting the way for a person. Even when we do not recognize this light, there is a direct c onnection between the point of the heart and the light due to fill it, as planned from above. Studying Kabbalah books enables a person to connect to the source of the light, and g radually come to feel a desire for spirituality. Th is process is called segula (remedy). Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag wrote in the Introduction to th e Study of the Ten Sefirot: Accordingly, why did the Kabbalists instruct everyo ne to study Kabbalah? While it is great and worthwhile publicizing that there is an incomparably wonderful quality to stud ying Kabbalah wisdom, even though they do not know what they are studying , it is the tremendous desire to understand what they are studying that awakens the lights surroundi ng their soul. That means that e very person is assured the possibility of eventually attaining all the won derful achievements the Creator intended for us in planning Creation. Those who do not attain them in this incarnation wi ll do so in another, until the Creator’s intention is fulfil led. Even if a person does not achieve this complet ion, the lights are destined to be his; the Surrounding Lights wait for him to prepare his Vess el to receive them. Therefore, even when he lacks the Vessels, when a person is engaged in this wisdo m and rec alls the names of the lights and Vessels waiting and belonging to him, they will shine on hi m but only to a certain degree. But they will not penetrate his inner soul, since his Vessels are not yet ready to accept them. Kabbalah is the only mea ns to create the Vessel to receive the light of the Creator. Th e light he receives when he is engaged in the wisdom imparts to him a grace from above, bestowing an abundance of holiness and purity on him, bringing him closer to reaching completion. Kabbalah is special in that it gives a person a tas te of spirituality while he is studying, and from t hat experience he comes to prefer spirituality to materialism. In pro portion to his spirituality, he clarifies his will and learns to distance himself from things he was once attracted to, much as an adult is no longer attracted to childish game s. Why do we need Kabbalah? Because Kabbalah is given to us as a springboard for change. It is given to u s so that we can know and perceive the Creator at any given mome nt throughout the day. These are the only reasons w hy the wisdom of Kabbalah was provided. Whoever learns Kab balah in order to alter himself and improve himself , in order to know the Creator, reaches the stage in which he begins to see he can improve, and fulfill his true destiny in this lifetime. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Who Is a Kabbalist? The Kabbalist is a researcher who studies his natur e using a proven, time-tested and accurate method. He studies the essence of his existence using tools we can all uti lize – feelings, intellect and heart. A Kabbalist looks like an ordinary person. He need not have any special skills, talents, or occupation . He need not be a wise man or wear a holy expression. At some po int in his life, this ordinary person decided to lo ok for a way in which he would find credible answers to the questio ns that were troubling him. By utilizing a distinct method of learning, he was successful in acquiring an extra s ense – a sixth sense – which is the spiritual sense . Through this sense, the Kabbalist feels the spiritu al spheres as a clear reality, just as we feel our reality here; he receives knowledge about the spiritual spheres, the upper worlds, and the revelation of higher forces. These worlds are called upper worlds, since they are higher than and beyond our world. The Kabbalist ascends from his current spiritual le vel to the next one. This movement brings him from one upper world to the next. He sees the roots from which eve rything that exists here has developed, everything that fills our world, including ourselves. The Kabbalist is simult aneously in our world, and in the upper worlds. Thi s quality is shared by all Kabbalists. Kabbalists receive the real information that surrou nds us, and feel this reality. Therefore, they can study it, be familiar with it, and teach us about it. They provi de a new method through which we can meet the sourc e of our lives, leading us to spirituality. They use books t hat are written in a special language. We must read these books in a special way, so they become a Vessel for discoverin g the truth for us as well. In the books they have written, the Kabbalists info rm us about the techniques based on man’s personal experiences. From their all-encompassing point of view, they hav e found the way to help those who would follow, and then climb the same ladder as they did. Their method is called the wisdom of Kabbalah. Chapter 4: The History of Kabbalah and The Zohar The first Kabbalist we know of was the patriarch Ab raham. He saw the wonders of human existence, asked questions of the Creator, and the upper worlds were revealed to him. The knowledge he acquired, and th e method used in its acquisition, he passed on to coming gen erations. Kabbalah was passed among the Kabbalists from mouth to mouth for many centuries. Each Kabbalist added h is unique experience and personality to this body o f accumulated knowledge. Their spiritual achievements were described in the language relevant to the sou ls of their generation. Kabbalah continued to develop after the Bible (the Five Books of Moses) was written. In the period bet ween the First and Second Temples (586 BCE – 515 BCE), it wa s already being studied in groups. Following the de struction of the Second Temple (70 CE) and until the current generation, there have been three particularly impo rtant periods in the development of Kabbalah, during which the mo st important writings on Kabbalah study methods wer e issued. The first period occurred during the 2 nd century, when the book of The Zohar was written by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, “the Rashbi.” This was around the year 150 CE. Rabbi Shimon was a pupil of the famous Rabbi Ak iva (40 CE – 135 CE). Rabbi Akiva and several of his discip les were tortured and killed by the Romans, who fel t threatened by his teaching of the Kabbalah. They flayed his sk in and stripped his bones with an iron scraper (lik e today’s currycomb) for cleaning their horses. Following the death of 24,000 of Rabbi Akiva’s disciples, the Ra shbi was authorized by Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehuda Ben Baba to teach future generations the Kabbalah as it had been taught to him. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and four oth ers were the only ones to survive. Following the ca pture and imprisonment of Rabbi Akiva, the Rashbi escaped wit h his son, Elazar. They hid in a cave for 13 years. They emerged from the cave with The Zohar, and with a crystallized method for studying Kabbalah and ac hieving spirituality. The Rashbi reached the 125 levels man can achieve during his life in this world. The Zoh ar tells us that he and his son reached the level called “Eliyahu th e Prophet,” meaning that the Prophet himself came t o teach them. The Zohar is written in a unique form; it is in the form of parables and is presented in Aramaic, a la nguage spoken in biblical times. The Zohar tells us that Aramaic is “the reverse side of Hebrew,” the hidden side of He brew. Rabbi"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Shimon Bar Yochai did not write this himself; he co nveyed the wisdom and the way to reach it in an org anized manner by dictating its contents to Rabbi Aba. Aba rewrote The Zohar in such a way that only those who are worthy of understanding would be able to do so. The Zohar explains that human development is divide d into 6,000 years, during which time souls undergo a continuous process of development in each generatio n. At the end of the process souls reach a position of “the end of correction,” i.e., the highest level of spiritua lity and wholeness. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was one of the greatest of his generation. He wrote and interpreted many Kabba listic subjects that were published and are well known to this day. On the other hand, the book of The Zohar, disappeared after it was written. According to legend, The Zohar writings were kept h idden in a cave in the vicinity of Safed in Israel. They were found several hundred years later by Arabs residing in the area. A Kabbalist from Safed purchased some fish at the market one day, and was astonished to discover the priceless value of the paper in which they had been wrapped. He immediately set about purchasing the remaining piec es of paper from the Arabs, and collected them into a book. This happened because the nature of hidden things i s such that they must be discovered at a suitable m oment, when suitable souls reincarnate and enter into our world . That is how The Zohar came to be revealed over ti me. The study of these writings was conducted in secret by small groups of Kabbalists. The first publicati on of this book was by Rabbi Moshe de Leon, in the 13 th century in Spain. The second period of the development of Kabbalah is very important to the Kabbalah of our generation. This is the period of “the Ari,” Rabbi Yitzhak Luria, who creat ed the transition between the two methods of Kabbal ah study. The first time the pure language of Kabbalah appear ed was in the writings of the Ari. The Ari proclaim ed the start of a period of open mass study of Kabbalah. The Ari was born in Jerusalem in 1534. A child when his father died, his mother took him to Egypt wher e he grew up in his uncle’s home. During his life in Egypt, he made his living in com merce but devoted most of his time to studying Kabb alah. Legend has it that he spent seven years in isolation on th e island of Roda on the Nile where he studied The Z ohar, books by the first Kabbalists, and writings by another rabbi of his generation, “the Ramak,” Rabbi Moshe Cordov ero. In 1570, the Ari arrived in Safed, Israel. Despite his youth, he immediately started teaching Kabbalah . His greatness was soon recognized; all the wise men of Safed, who were very knowledgeable in the hidden and revealed Wisdom, came to study with him, and he became famous. For a year-and-a-half his disciple Rabbi Chaim Vital com mitted to paper the answers to many of the questions that aro se during his studies. The Ari left behind a basic system for studying Kab balah, which is still in use today. Some of these w ritings are Etz Hachayim (The Tree of Life), Sha’ar HaKavanot (The Gateway of Intentions), Sha’ar HaGilgulim (The Gateway of Reincarnation), and others. The Ari died in 1572, s till a young man. His writings were archived accord ing to his last wish, in order not to reveal his doctrine before th e time was ripe. The great Kabbalists provided the method and taught it, but knew that their generation was still unabl e to appreciate its dynamics. Therefore, they often preferred to hi de or even burn their writings. We know that Baal H aSulam burned and destroyed a major part of his writings. There is special significance in this fact that the knowledge was committed to paper, and later destroyed. Whatever i s revealed in the material world affects the future , and is revealed easier the second time. Rabbi Vital ordered other parts of the Ari’s writin gs to be hidden and buried with him. A portion was handed down to his son, who arranged the famous writings, The E ight Gates. Much later, a group of scholars headed by Rabbi Vital’s grandson removed another portion from the g rave. Study of The Zohar in groups started openly only du ring the period of the Ari. The study of The Zohar then prospered for two hundred years. In the great Hassi dut period (1750 – to the end of the 19 th century), almost every great rabbi was a Kabbalist. Kabbalists appeared, m ainly in Poland, Russia, Morocco, Iraq, Yemen and s everal other countries. Then, at the beginning of the 20 th century, interest in Kabbalah waned until it almos t completely disappeared. The third period of the development of Kabbalah con tains an additional method to the Ari’s doctrines, written in this generation by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, who authored the commentary of the Sulam (ladder) of The Zohar, and the Ari’s teachings. His method is particularly suited to the souls of the current generation. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag is known as “Baal HaSulam” for his rendition of the Sulam of The Zohar. Born in 18 85 in Lodz, Poland, he absorbed a deep knowledge of the w ritten and oral law in his youth, and later became a judge and teacher in Warsaw. In 1921, he immigrated to Israel with his family and became the rabbi of Givat Shau l in Jerusalem. He was already immersed in writing his o wn doctrine when he began to pen the commentary of The Zohar in 1943. Baal HaSulam finished writing his co mmentary of The Zohar in 1953. He died the followin g year and was buried in Jerusalem at the Givat Shaul ceme tery."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"His eldest son, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag, “the Ra bash,” became his successor. His books are structur ed according to his father’s instructions. They gracef ully elaborate on his father’s writings, facilitati ng our comprehension of his father’s commentaries as hande d down to our generation. The Rabash was born in Warsaw in 1907 and immigrate d to Israel with his father. Only after Rabbi Baruc h was married did his father include him in study groups of selected students learning the hidden wisdom of Kabbalah. He was soon allowed to teach his father’s new students . Following his father’s death, he took it upon himse lf to continue teaching the special method he had l earned. Despite his great achievements, like his father, he insiste d on keeping to a very modest way of life. During h is lifetime he worked as a cobbler, construction worker and clerk. Externally, he lived like any ordinary person, but devoted every spare moment to studying and teaching Kabbalah. The Rabash died in 1991. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, the Baal HaSulam, is the recog nized spiritual leader for our generation. He is th e only one in this generation who has written a fully comprehensi ve and updated commentary of The Zohar and the writ ings of the Ari. These books, with the addition of his son Rabbi Baruch Ashlag’s essays, are the only source w e can use to assist us in further progress. When we study their books, we are actually studying The Zohar and the Ari’s writings through the most recent commentaries (of the past 50 years). This is a life belt for our generation, since it enables us to st udy ancient texts as if they had been written now, and to use them as a springboard to spirituality. Baal HaSulam’s method suits everyone, and the sulam (ladder) he built in his writings ensures that non e of us need fear studying Kabbalah. Anyone learning Kabbalah is assured that within three to five years he will be able to reach spiritual spheres, all realities and divine underst anding, the name given to that which is above and b eyond us and not yet felt by us. If we study according to the books of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, the Baal HaSulam, we can re ach true correction. The study method is constructed to awaken in us a d esire to understand the upper worlds. We are given a greater desire to get to know our roots and to connect with them. We are then empowered to improve and fulfill ourselves. All three great Kabbalists are of the same soul: fi rst appearing as Rabbi Shimon, on a second occasion as the Ari, and the third time as Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. On each occasion, the timing was ripe for further revelatio n because the people of that generation were worthy, and the soul descended to teach the method suitable for that ge neration. Each generation is increasingly worthy of discoveri ng The Zohar. What was written by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and hidden was later discovered by the generation o f Rabbi Moshe de Leon, and then by the Ari, who sta rted to interpret it in the language of Kabbalah. These wri tings were also stored away and partly rediscovered when the timing was right. Our generation is privileged to l earn from the Sulam, which enables everyone to stud y Kabbalah and to correct himself now. We see that The Zohar speaks to each generation. In each generation it is more revealed and better und erstood than in the generation before. Each generation opens the book of The Zohar in a unique way, suited to the r oots of its particular soul. Importantly, at the same time, an attempt is made t o conceal Kabbalistic writings so that those feelin g the need to seek them will discover them by themselves. The Kab balists evidently know that the process of change r equires two conditions: correct timing and maturity of the soul . We are witnessing a very interesting occurrence, characterized by the breakthrough and signaling of a new era in t he study of Kabbalah. Chapter 5: Who Can Study Kabbalah? Whenever Kabbalah is discussed, statements are toss ed about such as: One can go mad studying Kabbalah; it is safe to study Kabbalah only after the age of 40; a man m ust be married and have at least three children bef ore embarking on its study; women are forbidden to study Kabbalah , etc. Kabbalah is open to all. It is for those who truly wish to correct themselves in order to attain spiri tuality. The need comes from the soul’s urge to correct itself. That is actually the only test to determine whether a pe rson is ready to study Kabbalah: the desire to correct oneself. This desire must be genuine and free of outside pressur e, since only one’s self can discover one’s true desire."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The great Kabbalist, the Ari, wrote that from his g eneration onwards Kabbalah was intended for men, wo men and children, and that all could and should study Kabba lah. The greatest Kabbalist in our generation, Yehu da Ashlag, Baal HaSulam, left a new study method for this gene ration. It is suitable for anyone wishing to embark on the study of Kabbalah. A person finds his way to Kabbalah when he is no lo nger satisfied by material reward and hopes studyin g will provide answers, clarification and new opportunitie s. He no longer finds solutions in this world to th e significant questions concerning his existence. More often than not, the hope of finding answers is not even cogni tive; he simply takes an interest and finds it necessary. Such a person has questions: Who am I? Why was I bo rn? Where do I come from? Where am I going? Why do I exist in the world? Was I already here? Will I reap pear? Why is there so much suffering in the world? Can it somehow be avoided? How can I attain pleasure, comp leteness, peace of mind? Unconsciously, he feels th e answers to these questions can be found only beyond the rea lm of this world. The one answer to these questions is to know and fe el the upper worlds, and the way to do so is throug h Kabbalah. Through its wisdom, man enters the upper worlds wit h all his feelings. They are worlds that provide al l of the reasons for his existence in this world. He takes c ontrol of his life, thereby attaining his goal – tr anquility, pleasure and completeness – while he is still in this world. In the Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot it is written: “If we put our hearts into answerin g just one famous question, I am sure all questions and doubts will d isappear from the horizon and we will find they are gone. And that tiny question is – What is the point of our lives?” Anyone attracted to the study of Kabbalah due to th is question is welcome to study Kabbalah. The one w ho reaches serious study feels this question and asks himself constantly: “What is the point of our lives?” This is what urges him to search and find answers. People want quick cures. They want to learn about m agic, meditation and healing associated with Kabbal ah. They are not truly interested in the revelation of the u pper worlds, or in learning the methods of reaching spiritual realms. This does not qualify as a genuine desire to study Kabbalah. When the time is right and the need is there, a per son will look for a framework of study and will not be satisfied until he finds one. Everything depends on the root of man’s soul and that point of his heart. A true d esire within his heart to discover and feel the upper worlds will le ad him to the way of Kabbalah. Chapter 6: How To Study Kabbalah? Several hundred years ago, it was impossible to fin d Kabbalah books or books on this subject. Kabbalah was transmitted solely from one Kabbalist to another, n ever reaching the ordinary person. Today, the situa tion is reversed. There is a desire to circulate the materi al among all, and to call on everyone to participat e in its study. When studying these books, the desire for spiritual ity grows, whereby the light surrounding us, the re al world hidden from us, starts to reflect on those people w ho wish to be closer to the special charm of spirit uality, and they start to desire it even more. Kabbalists prohibited the study of Kabbalah by peop le who had not been prepared for it, unless they di d so under special circumstances. They treated their students cautiously to ensure they studied in the proper man ner. They limited students by certain criteria. Baal HaSulam describes these reasons at the beginni ng of his Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot . However, if we understand these restrictions as conditions f or the proper comprehension of Kabbalah, we will se e that they are intended as a way to prevent students from deviatin g from the correct way. What has changed is that we now have more of a lang uage, better conditions and a stronger determinatio n to study Kabbalah. Because souls feel the need to study Kabb alah, Kabbalists such as Baal HaSulam have written commentaries that enable us to study free of errors . Everyone can now learn Kabbalah through his books . To study Kabbalah in the proper way, it is recommen ded that the student focus solely on the writings o f the Ari, Baal HaSulam and Rabash in their original versions. The primary objective of Kabbalah is to achieve spi rituality."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Only one thing is necessary – proper instruction. I f a person studies Kabbalah in the right way, he pr ogresses without forcing himself. There can be no coercion i n spirituality. The aim of study is for a person to discover the co nnection between himself and what is written in the book; this should always be borne in mind. That is the reason Kabbalists wrote down what they experienced and ach ieved. It is not in order to acquire knowledge of how reality is built and functions, as in science. The intention of the Kabbalah texts is to create an understanding and assimilatio n of its spiritual truth. If a person approaches the texts in order to gain s pirituality, the text becomes a source of light and corrects him. If he approaches the texts in order to gain wisdom, it is for him mere wisdom. The measure of inner deman d is what determines the measure of strength he gleans, and t he pace of his correction. That means that if a person studies in the proper m anner, he crosses the barrier between this world an d the spiritual world. He enters a place of inner revelation and re aches the light. That is known as the beautiful sig n. If he does not achieve this, it is a sign that he has been neglige nt in the quality or quantity of his efforts; he di d not make a sufficient effort. It is not a question of how much he studied, but a question of how focused he was o n his intentions, or if he lacked something. However, if he reaches t his desire to correct himself, he can attain spirit uality. Only then will the heavens open for him to allow his entry in to another world, another reality, another dimensio n. He reaches this stage by studying Kabbalah in the right way. Embracing Kabbalah does not work by merely avoiding nice things so that one’s desire will not be kindl ed. Correction does not come from self-punishment, but rather as a result of spiritual achievement. When a person achieves spirituality, the light appears and correc ts him. This is the only way a person changes. Any other wa y is hypocritical. He is mistaken if he believes th at by putting on a nice appearance he will achieve spirituality. Inner correction will not follow, since only the li ght can correct. The purpose of studying is to invite the light that corrects one. Therefore, a person should work on h imself only for that purpose. If there is any pressure, or any obligatory rules o r regulations, it is a sign that it is man-made and is not an action intended by the upper worlds. In addition, inner ha rmony and tranquility are not prerequisites for att aining spirituality; they will appear as a result of the c orrection. But a person should not believe this can happen without an effort on his part. The Kabbalah way absolutely rejects any form of coe rcion. It grants a person an inkling of spiritualit y, bringing him to prefer it to materialism. Then, in relation to h is spirituality, he clarifies his desire. According ly, he retreats from material things as his attraction to or necessity f or them disappears. Studying Kabbalah incorrectly, even with the best i ntentions, can distance a person from spirituality. This type of student will only fail. Among the languages of the study of spiritual world s, between the Bible (which includes the Five Books of Moses, the Prophets and the Scriptures) and Kabbalah, the latter is the most useful and direct. Those who lea rn it cannot err in their understanding. It does not use names from this world, but possesses a special dictionary dire ctly indicating the spiritual tools for spiritual objects and force s, and the correlation between them. It is therefore the most useful language for the st udent to make inner progress and to correct himself . If we study the writings of Baal HaSulam, there is no danger of bec oming confused. Spirituality can be attained by studying the right books, i.e., books written by a true Kabbalist. The Bible’s texts are Kabbalah texts. They are books Kabbalists wrote to one another to exchange ideas and to assist each ot her in learning. A person whose spiritual feelings have gr own can see how these books assist him in continuin g his growth and development. It is like being led by a tour gui de in a foreign country. With the aid of the guideb ook, the traveler becomes oriented and better understands his new whe reabouts. We need books that are suited to our souls, books b y the Kabbalists of our generation or the previous one, since different souls descend in each generation and requ ire different teaching methods. A student in search of a Kabbalah teacher must do s o with care. There are so-called Kabbalists who tea ch incorrectly. For example, it is sometimes claimed t hat wherever the word “body” is written it refers t o our physical body, that the right hand symbolizes charity and th e left, bravery. This is exactly the strict prohibi tion rendered by the Bible and Kabbalists in “Thou shall not make a sculpture or a picture.” Why are there those who teach and interpret this wa y? First of all, they themselves do not comprehend the kabbalistic language of branches. [See the chapter on “The Language Of Kabbalists: Branches.”] If ther e were a direct connection between spiritual forces and our physical bodies, it would have been possible to tea ch people to succeed in life, and to cure the body by physical m eans under the guise of spirituality. It is important to join the right study group in wh ich to explore the writings of a real Kabbalist. Th is should be done under the guidance of a Kabbalist."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The group provides strength. Everybody has at least a small desire for materialism, and an even smalle r desire for spiritualism. The way to augment the will for spiri tualism is through joint desire. Several students t ogether stimulate Ohr makif (Surrounding Light). Although the physical body se parates people, it does not affect spiritualism, si nce in spiritualism, the point of the heart is shared by a ll, resulting in a much greater result. All of the Kabbalists studied in groups. Rabbi Shim on Bar Yochai held a group for students, and so did the Ari. A group is vital in order to progress. It is the prim ary tool of Kabbalah, and everyone is measured by h is contribution to the group. It is essential to receive from a true Kabbalist wh o himself studied under the guidance of a Kabbalist . A group does not eliminate the need for a Kabbalist; it is impos sible without a Kabbalist since it is he who direct s the group. The texts and the Kabbalist help the student so tha t he does not deviate from the correct way of study ing. He works on himself and on his inner being. No one knows the others’ place in the group, nor his level of spiri tuality. The books, the group and the Kabbalist simply help him to stay on course and increase his will for spiritu ality, instead of following other desires or worthless endeavors. To help students avoid failure, a list of questions and answers and an index of words and expressions is provided. During study sessions, attention is drawn to spirit ual truth, not to the depth or measure of comprehen sion. What is important is that the student is motivated to make spiritual progress, and not merely to advance intel lectually. It is true that people are attracted to the wisdom of Kabbalah in the hope of becoming more successful . We are all made of the desire to receive pleasure. It is our b asic makeup, but with proper instruction some of us attain spirituality and eternity. Others, without the prop er instruction, live under the illusion that they h ave achieved something spiritual. In fact, they lose their chanc e of attaining spirituality in this lifetime. Chapter 7: Spirituality and Kabbalah Man is incapable of making a move without there bei ng some advantage in it for him. In order to act, h e must first see how he may gain from it. This gain serves as th e fuel that gets him moving. The fuel is either the immediate or future gain he envisages. If a person does not feel there is any profit, he will immediately halt his actions. That is because man cannot exist without feeling he will ga in something. The Kabbalah teaches man how to receive. In order to attain spirituality a perso n must expand his will to receive. He must expand his will to absorb all worlds, includin g this one. This is the purpose for which he was cr eated. It is not necessary to become a monk or ascetic, or steer awa y from life. On the contrary, Kabbalah obliges man to marry, bear children and work and live a full life. Nothin g has to be given up; everything was created for a reason, and man need not withdraw from life. When a person begins to study Kabbalah, he may have no spiritual feelings, and therefore he embarks on the learning process with the aid of his intellect. We are supposed to open our heart through our intellec t. When the heart develops, we feel what is right and what is n ot, and are naturally drawn to the right decisions and actions. The Kabbalists begin by teaching spirituality in sm all doses, to allow the students to expand their wi ll to receive more light, more awareness, more spiritual feeling. Increased will brings with it a greater depth, und erstanding and attainment. A person then reaches the highest level of spirituality he can attain, to the roots of his soul. Chapter 8: Reincarnation and Kabbalah "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"None of us are new souls; we all have accumulated e xperiences from previous lives in other incarnation s. In each generation over the past six thousand years, souls have descended that were here on previous occasions . They are not new souls, but souls of a different kind that a ttained some form of spiritual development. Souls descend to earth in a special order: They ent er the world cyclically. The number of souls is not infinite; they return again and again, progressing toward correcti on. They are encased in new physical bodies that ar e more or less the same, but the types of souls that descend are d ifferent. This is referred to nowadays as reincarna tion. Kabbalists use another term: the development of generations. This intertwining, the connection of the soul and b ody, assists in the correction of the soul. Man is referred to as “soul,” not “body.” The body itself can be replaced , just as organs can now be replaced. The body is u seful only in that it serves as an encasement through which the s oul can work. Each generation physically resembles the previous one, but they are different from one another becaus e each time the souls descend with the added experi ence of their previous lives here. They arrive with renewed stren gth obtained while they were in heaven. Thus, each generation possesses different desires a nd goals from the previous one. This leads to the s pecific development of each generation. Even a generation t hat does not reach the desire to know true reality or God-like recognition accomplishes the task by the suffering it endures. That is its way of making progress towa rd true reality. All souls are derived from one, called Adam HaRishon (the soul of the first man). This does not refer to Adam as a mere personality from the Bible. It is a concept of spiritual, inner reality. Parts of the soul of the first man descend into the world, taking the form of bodies, leading to a connection between body and soul. Reality is d irected in such a manner that the souls descend and correct themsel ves. When they enter into body form they raise thei r level 620 times above the level from which they began. The or der in which souls descend into this reality of wea ring a body goes from light to heavy. The soul of the first man comprises many parts and many desires, some light, others heavy, based on th e amount of egoism and cruelty they possess. They come into our world, the lighter ones first, the heavier ones fo llowing. Accordingly, correction requirements differ. In their descent into the world, souls have gathere d experience from their suffering. This is called t he path of suffering, as this experience develops the soul. Ea ch time it is reincarnated, it has an increased unc onscious urge to seek answers to questions on its existence, its roo ts, and the importance of man’s life. Accordingly, there are souls that are less develope d, and souls that are more so. The latter have such an enormous urge to recognize the truth that they cannot limit themselves to the confinements of this world. If th ey are given the right tools, the proper books and instruction, they will attain recognition of the spiritual world. Ka bbalah also describes the descending souls as pure or as less r efined. It is a measurement in direct proportion to how much the souls require for correction. Souls requiring a gre ater correction are called less refined. As different souls descend, they require different guidance and correction, unique for that generation ’s souls. This is why in each generation there are people who lead us in our spiritual progress. They write books and fo rm study groups in order to convey the method of discovery o f the reality that is most suited to that generatio n. In this, the media age, they may appear on television, radio and most recently, on the Internet. In the beginning (before the soul of Ari appeared), there was an era of experience gathering and perse verance in this world. The souls’ existence was sufficient in order to make progress toward correction. The suffering they accumulated added urgency to their souls to relieve their suffering. The desire to leave their sufferi ng behind was the motivating force behind the development of the gene rations. That era continued until the 16 th century, when the Ari appeared and wrote that from his generation onwards, men, women and children in all the nations of the world could, and were required to, engage in Kabbalah. Th e reason was that the time had arrived in the development of gen erations, in which souls descending into the world were able to recognize true reality and were ready to complete t heir correction by the special method the Ari had d eveloped. They could achieve what was required of them. Souls have but one desire – while existing within p hysical bodies – to return to their roots, to the l evel they were before their descent. Physical bodies, with their d esire to receive, pull them back into this world. M an consciously wishes to rise spiritually. The great effort spent on the friction created by this dichotomy is what a ssists him in rising 620 times above his previous level. If a soul does not complete its task, the next time it descends into the world, it will reincarnate mo re deserving of correction. Sometimes, we believe that we should deny our desir es and longing so that in the next reincarnation we will be more successful. We think we should not desire anything except a little nutrition and lying in the sun, as would a cat. However, the contrary is true since in the next rou nd, we will be even more cruel, demanding, exacting and aggressive."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Creator wants us to be filled with spiritual pl easure, to be complete. That is possible only throu gh great desire. Only with a corrected desire can we truly reach the spiritual world and become strong and active. If o ur desire is small, while it cannot do great harm, it also canno t do much good. Desire is called corrected only whe n it functions out of the proper influence. It does not exist in u s automatically, but is acquired while studying Kab balah in the correct manner. A pyramid of souls exists, based on the desire to r eceive. At the base of the pyramid are many souls w ith small desires, earthly, looking for a comfortable life in an animal-like manner: food, sex, sleep. The next layer comprises fewer souls, those with the urge to acquire wealth. These are people who are willing to invest their e ntire lives in making money, and who sacrifice themselves for the sake of being rich. Next are those that will do anything to control oth ers, to govern and reach positions of power. An eve n greater desire, felt by even fewer souls, is for knowledge; these are scientists and academics, who spend thei r lives engaged in discovering something specific. They are interes ted in nothing but their all-important discovery. Located at the zenith of the pyramid is the stronge st desire, developed by only a small few, for the a ttainment of the spiritual world. All these levels are built into th e pyramid. Man also has the same pyramid of desires within him , which he must overturn so that its sheer weight w ill compel him to aim for the purest desire, the infinite desi re for truth. He must reject and discard all his ea rthly egoistic desires and put every effort and energy into increa sing the desire for spirituality. He achieves this through the proper way of studying. When a person truly wishes to increase his longing for spirituality, then the light around him, the sp iritual world hidden from him, starts to reflect back on him, mak ing him long for it even more. At this stage, group study under a Kabbalist’s guidance is crucial. [See the chapter o n “How to Study Kabbalah.”] A major change in the souls descending today lies i n the fact that we are starting to see around us a definite desire to achieve a spiritual system. Even ordinary people ar e seeking something spiritual, something beyond our world. Although this “spirituality” may include all sorts of shortcuts, magic tricks and esoteric teachings a nd groups promising answers to those who join them, neverthel ess, it bespeaks of the search for a different real ity. If a generation displays a stronger desire within the so uls themselves, a new method, suited to these souls , will emerge. In the last fifteen years there has been swift and active development in the descent of new souls. The desire of these souls is much stronger and more genuine. It is dire cted at achieving the real truth and nothing else. When we truly comprehend how reality applies to us and how we are affected by it, we will cease doing that which is prohibited; we will insist on the right thing an d we will do it. Then we will discover harmony betw een the real world and ourselves. In the meantime, we unconsciously err, then realize we have erred. It may appear that there is no poss ibility of escape. That is why mankind finds itself more and m ore in a blind alley, mired in increasingly difficu lt dilemmas. We will discover that there is no alternative to re cognizing the spiritual world of which we are a par t. This recognition will lead us to a new situation in whic h we will consciously begin to act as one collectiv e body, and not just as individuals. All people are connected to one another in one soul , from one generation of souls to the next. We all possess collective responsibility. That is why the Kabbalis t is regarded as “founder of the world.” He influen ces the entire world, and the world influences him. Chapter 9: The Language of Kabbalists: Branches When we think or feel something and wish to convey it to someone else so that he may feel it too, we u se words. There is a general consensus in the use of words an d their meanings; when we call something “sweet,” t he other person immediately understands what we mean since h e imagines the same taste. Yet how closely does his conception of sweet match ours? How can we best com municate our feelings while still using words? The feelings of Kabbalists are above our level. Nev ertheless, they wish to convey to us their wonder a t things that have no meaning for us. They do this through means taken from our world: often words, sometimes music notes, and on occasion, by other means."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Kabbalists write about their experiences and feelin gs in the upper worlds. They write about the higher forces and what they discover there. They write for other Kabb alists, since the interaction of studies between th em is so essential and so fruitful. Their writings are then extended to those who haven’t yet sensed spirituali ty, for those whose spirituality is still hidden. Since there are no words in the spiritual world to describe their spiritual feelings, Kabbalists call these experiences branches, a word taken from our world. Therefore th e language used in books on Kabbalah is called the language of branches. It is a language that borrows words from our world and uses them to identify spiritual exper iences. Since everything in the spiritual world has an equivalent in the physical world, each root of the spiritual world has a name and the name of its branch. And because we cannot d escribe our feelings precisely and do not know how to measure or compare them, we use all kinds of auxiliary word s to help. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag writes in his book Talmud Esser HaSefirot (Study of the Ten Sefirot, Part 1 Looking Inwards): ...the Kabbalists chose a special language that can be referred to as the “language of branches.” Noth ing takes place in this world that is not drawn from it s roots in the spiritual world. On t he contrary, everything in this world originates in the spiritua l world and then descends into this world. The Kabbalists accordingly found a ready language by wh ich they could easily convey their achievements to one another orally and in writing for futur e generations. They took the names of branches from the material world; each name is self-explanatory and i ndicates its upper root in the higher world system. For every force and action in this world there is a force and action in the spiritual world that is it s root. Each spiritual force correlates to only one force, its branch in t he material world. Of this direct correlation it is written, “There is nothing growing below that does not have an angel above urging it to grow.” That is, there is nothing in our world th at does not have a corresponding force in the spiri tual world. Because of this direct correlation, and because spi rituality does not contain names – just feelings an d forces without the mantle of animal, mineral, vegetable, or speech – Kabbalists use names of branches in this world i n order to define their spiritual roots by them. Baal HaSulam writes further: With all the explanations, you will comprehend what sometimes appear in the Kabbalah books as strange terminology for the human spirit, particularly in the basic Kabbalah books, The Zoha r and books by the Ari. The question arises, why did Kabbalists use su ch simple terminology to express these lofty ideas? The explanation is that no language in the world ca n reasonably be used, except for the special language of branches, based on the corresponding upper roots ... It should not be surprising if strange expressi ons are sometimes used, since there is no choice in the matter. The matter of good cannot replace the matt er of bad, and vice versa. We must always convey precisely the branch or inci dent showing the upper root as the occasion dictates. We must also elaborate un til the exact definition is found. In Kabbalah, the student repeats the main ideas of Kabbalistic wisdom: “place,” “time,” “movement,” “l ack,” “body,” “body parts” or “organs,” “match,” “kiss,” “hug,” etc., over and over again, until he feels wi thin himself the right feeling for every idea. A final word: It should be noted that there are som e so-called instructors of Kabbalah who communicate erroneous interpretations to their students. The error stems from the fact that the Kabbalists wrote their books using the language of branches and used words from our world to express spiritual ideas. Those who do not unders tand the correct use of this language are mistaken. They tea ch that there is a connection between the body and the spiritual Vessel, for example, as if by physical actions a pe rson is doing something spiritual. The branches are an integral part of Kabbalah and without their use, one is not learn ing true Kabbalah. Chapter 10: Sensing Reality through Kabbalah "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Everything we know about our world is based on man- made study. Every generation studies our world and conveys its knowledge to the following generation. Through it, each generation comprehends the sort of framewo rk in which he should live, and what his position is in relatio n to other generations. In each era, mankind uses t he world surrounding him. The same process takes place in spiritualism. Every generation of Kabbalists from Abraham onwards stud ies and discovers the spiritual worlds. Just as in scientif ic research, they pass along the knowledge they hav e attained to future generations. In this world we have a general sense, called the d esire to receive, with five receptors, which are ou r five senses. When a person undergoes a correction, he attains th e sixth sense, known as the spiritual sense. This s ense enables him to feel the spiritual reality. It is not in the same category as the other five senses whatsoever. Scientists, too, use only their five senses. Any in strument – precise, advanced, technical, mechan-ica l or otherwise – we regard as “objective.” But these instruments mer ely expand the limits of our senses so that we may hear, see, smell, taste and touch more intricately. Ultimately , it is man who examines, measures and assesses the results of research, through his five senses. Obviously, he ca nnot provide an exact, objective answer to what is accomplished by the senses. Kabbalah, the source of all wisdom, enables us to do this. When starting to study reality, we discover that we cannot study or understand that which is beyond us since it is unknown and unrevealed to us. If we cannot see it o r touch or taste it, we may question whether it rea lly exists. Only Kabbalists, those who attain a higher abstract uppe r light beyond our senses, are able to comprehend o ur true reality. Kabbalists tell us that beyond our senses there is only an abstract upper light, called the Creator. I magine that we are in the middle of the ocean, within a sea of light. We can sense all kinds of feelings that seem to be incorporated into it, as far as our ability to comprehend allows us. We do not hear what is happening elsewhere. What we regard as hearing comes as the response of our eardrums to ex ternal stimuli. We do not know what is causing it. We simply know that our eardrum reacts from within us. We ass ess it internally and accept it as an external even t. We do not know what is happening outside of ourselves; we mer ely comprehend the reaction of our senses to it. As in the example of hearing, so it is with our oth er senses: sight, taste, touch and smell. That mean s that we can never exit our “box.” Whatever we say about what is happening externally is in fact the picture we pai nt inside us. This restriction can never be overcome. The study of Kabbalah can assist us in expanding th e borders of our natural senses to achieve the sixt h sense, through which we can become acquainted with the rea lity around and within us. This reality is the true reality. Through it, we will be able to experience the react ion of our senses externally. If we direct all of o ur five senses correctly, we will see the true picture of reality. We need merely to internalize the characteristics of the spiritual world. It is like a radio that is able to tune into a cert ain wavelength. The wavelength exists outside of th e radio, which receives and responds to it. This example applies t o us, too. If we experience at least one tiny spark of the spiritual world, we will begin to feel it within ourselves. During his development, the Kabbalist acquires more and more spiritual characteristics, thereby connec ting to all the levels of the spiritual world, all built on the sam e principle. When a person studies Kabbalah, he beg ins to understand, to feel, to assess and work with all re alities, both spiritual and material, without diffe rentiating between them. The Kabbalist reaches the spiritual world whi le encased in his body in this world. He feels the two worlds without any border separating them. Only when a person experiences this true reality ca n he see the reasons for what is happening to him h ere. He understands the consequences of his actions. He the n begins to be practical for the first time, living , feeling everything and knowing what he should do with himse lf and his life. Prior to this recognition he does not have the abil ity to know why he was born, who he is and the cons equences of his actions. Everything is enclosed within the bord ers of the material world, and the way he enters it is also the way he leaves it. In the meantime, we are all at the level called “Th is World.” Our senses are equally limited; therefor e, we are capable only of seeing the same picture. Baal HaSul am writes, “All upper and lower worlds are included in man.” This is the key sentence for anyone interested in t he wisdom of Kabbalah and living the reality around him. The reality around us includes upper worlds as well as this world; together, they are part of man. For the time being, we understand this world throug h material, physical elements. However, we add seve ral elements when we study, through which we discover a dditional elements. It allows us to see things we c annot see today. At first our level is very low, as we are located d iametrically opposite the level of the Creator. But then we start to rise from this level by correcting our desire. We t hen discover another reality surrounding us, althou gh no change actually occurs. We change within ourselves, and fo llowing the change, become aware of other elements"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"surrounding us. Later, these elements disappear and we feel everything is due solely to the Creator, t he Almighty. The elements we begin to gradually discover are cal led worlds. We should not try to imagine spiritual reality, but should sense it. Imagining it merely distances us from its reach. Kabbalists reach the upper worlds through their sen ses, just as we reach out to the material world. Th e worlds stand between us and the Creator, hiding Him from us. As Baal HaSulam writes, it is as if the worlds filter the light for us. We can then see reality surrounding us in a differe nt way. In fact, we will discover that there is not hing between us and the Creator. All these disturbances, these worlds between us, hi de Him from us. They are masks placed on our senses . We do not see Him in his true form; we see only fractured ele ments. In Hebrew, the origin of the word Olam (world) is “ alama ” (concealing). Part of the light is transmitted, a nd part is hidden. The higher the world, the less h idden the Creator is. Those in this world paint different pictures of rea lity differently. Logic dictates that reality shoul d be uniform to everyone. Nevertheless, one hears one thing, anothe r hears something else, one sees one thing, and ano ther sees it differently. Baal HaSulam illustrates this by using electricity as an example: We have in our homes an electric soc ket that contains abstract energy which cools, heats, create s a vacuum or pressure depending on the appliance u sing it, and on the ability of the appliance to utilize the elec tricity. Yet the energy has no form of its own, and remains abstract. The appliance reveals the potential found in the el ectricity. We can say the same about the upper light, the Crea tor that has no form. Each person feels the Creator according to the level of his correction. At the beginning of hi s studies, a person can see only that his reality e xists, and is unable to sense any higher force. He gradually discovers, through using his senses, t he true, expanded reality. At a more advanced stage , if he corrects all his senses according to the light around him, t here will be no separation between himself and the light, between man and the Creator. It will be as if there is no d ifference between their characteristics. The person then achieves godliness in the real sense. Godliness is the highe st level of spirituality. How can a beginner master this science when he cann ot even properly understand his teacher? The answer is very simple. It is only possible when we spiritually lif t ourselves up above this world. Only if we rid ourselves of all of the traces of ma terial egoism and accept attaining spiritual values as our true goal. Only the longing and the passion for spirituality i n our world – that is the key to the higher world. Chapter 11: Kabbalistic Music Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the S ulam commentary of The Zohar, expressed his spiritu al feelings through the words of his numerous publishe d writings. Among them he wrote songs and composed melodies based on these spiritual feelings. The music itself is based on the way a person feels in the spiritual world. What is so special about t he music is that everyone can understand it, even if he has not reac hed the composer’s spiritual level. Listening to th e Baal HaSulam’s music, as conveyed by his son Rabbi Baruc h Ashlag, we have the opportunity to experience the spiritual sentiments of these prominent Kabbalists. The Kabbalist achieves two polarized stages in spir itualism: agony, as a result of drifting away from the Creator, and delight, as a result of getting closer to Him. The feeling of drifting away from the Creator produces sad music, expressed by a prayer appealing for closeness. The feeling of closeness to the Creator produces joyous music, expressed by a thanksgiving prayer. Therefore, we hear and feel two distinct moods in t he music: longing and desire for unification when d rifting away, and love and happiness when discovering unification . The two moods together express the Kabbalist’s un ification with the Creator. The music bathes the listener in a wondrous light. We do not need to know anything about it before lis tening to it, since it is wordless. Yet its effect on our hearts is direct and swift. Hearing it over and over again is a special experience. The notes are composed in adherence to Kabbalistic rules. The notes are chosen according to the way ma n’s soul is built. The listener feels them penetrating deep wit hin his soul, unobstructed. This happens because of the direct connection between our souls and the roots of the n otes."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In 1996, 1998, and 2000, three CDs of the Baal HaSu lam’s and Rabash’s music were recorded and publishe d.

Chapter 12: FAQs About Kabbalah We learn about Kabbalah by listening, reading, stud ying in groups and most importantly, asking questio ns and receiving answers. Following are some of the most f requently asked questions drawn from our Web site. If you have any questions you would like us to answ er, please write to info@kabbalah.info or visit our web site at www.kabbalah.info . I have been asking myself about my place in the wor ld. I don’t know whether Kabbalah is for me. What i s Kabbalah all about and what good will it do me if I study it? Kabbalah gives one answer to one common question: W hat is the essence of my life and my existence? Kab balah is for those who have been searching for answers; thes e people are best suited to studying Kabbalah. Kabb alah shows man the source and thus, the purpose of his life. I have always thought that Kabbalah is a secret. Su ddenly, Kabbalah has become the new, hot topic. How did this happen? For thousands of years it was prohibited to dissemi nate Kabbalah. Only during the 20 th century, when the books of the Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag were published, h ave we been afforded the possibility of studying Ka bbalah without restrictions. His writings are aimed at hel ping people like you, those without previous knowle dge of Kabbalah. It is permissible to distribute Kabbalah widely and to teach everyone who is seeking the mis sing spiritual elements in his life. Is it true that Rabbi Ashlag thought that Kabbalah should be taught to everyone, Jew and gentile alike ? Do you think that the gentile has a place in the corre ction process, or is this meant for study by Jews a lone? And what is the correction process all about? You may have read in the Bible that at the end of t he correction all will know God, from the youngest to the eldest, with no regard to gender or race. The Kabbalah is a bout man and the desire to receive, which God creat ed. All creatures have this desire to receive. Therefore, a ll who want to participate in the process of correc tion may do so. The correction is a process of exchanging one’s int entions from egoistic to altruistic ones, i.e., fro m the benefit of oneself to the benefit of the Creator. It is hoped that all mankind will be involved in this process. I am interested in learning more about Kabbalah. Is n’t it essential for a beginning student like mysel f to first study the Bible, the written and the oral law for m any years, before I begin learning Kabbalah, or can I start now? There are no prerequisite conditions to studying Ka bbalah. All that is needed is one’s curiosity and t he will to learn. Through the study of Kabbalah one learns how to be similar to the spiritual world in one’s deeds and t houghts. I have heard rumors that a rabbi or Kabbalah studen t put a spell on someone so he would die. My questi ons: Is such a thing possible? And if so, is there a spe ll that can be said? Also, I have purchased several books related to “good” magical practices and would like to know if you can steer me in the right direction as far as some of these books go. I do not know what books you have bought, but they do not deal with the true Kabbalah. Kabbalah is not about magic. Through study and reading you can gain a bet ter understanding of Kabbalah. We recommend several types of readings, e.g., the articles we prepare in which we teach about the stages of man’s development along his spiritual course. While it is important to study with a teach er and in a group setting, you can access these art icles through our Web site, and special prayer books that we produce. Seven years ago, I began my search for God, the Cre ator, the Father. Along the way my entire life was destroyed and I lost everything I held dear. One da y I told Him, “I will not give up until you answer me! You are all I have left.” Now I have begun to experienc e lights around people and animals. Isn’t this a manifestation of Kabbalah? I want to know God and t o develop spiritually. Your situation is precisely what motivates man to s tudy Kabbalah. The way to know God is very difficul t and requires specific study. And only after a spiritual feeling becomes revealed to him, does a man unders tand that his"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"former feelings were just products of his imaginati on. One cannot feel God until he ascends to the upp er worlds by turning all his egoistic characteristics into altru istic ones. I understand that the word Kabbalah is from the Heb rew verb lekabbel , to receive. What does this mean and what is the purpose of receiving? In the beginning, the Creator alone existed. He cre ated a general desire to receive. This desire to re ceive is called The First Man ( Adam HaRishon ). In order to enable The First Man to communicate with the Creator, the general desire to receive has been divided into many parts. The purpose of the creation is to achieve communio n with the Creator, because only in such a state can man achie ve fulfillment, endless tranquility and happiness. Does this imply that at some time in the distant fu ture, there will be only one man, again? The Kabbalah does not deal with our physical body, but only with our spiritual component. The upper wo rld is like one creature, one soul whose parts are projected to a lower world (the one we perceive) in which we fe el ourselves as distinct from each other. To explain this more s imply: Because we are limited within our egoism, we feel ourselves as separated from each other, despite the fact that we are all of us actually one spiritual body. Therefore, the separation exists only within our mistaken perc eption, for we are all in fact one. What are some of the concepts I will find in The Zoh ar? And who wrote The Zohar? The book of The Zohar explains how a man in this wo rld can reach the source of his soul. This road, or ladder, consists of 125 steps. The author of The Zohar must have passed through all of these stages. The soul of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag had reached the same heights (and spi ritual place) as the author of The Zohar, Rabbi Shi mon Bar Yochai. This is why Baal HaSulam was able to comple te the commentary on The Zohar, which we can use to day. Are you affiliated with other rabbis and other Kabb alah centers? Bnei Baruch is not connected in any manner to any o ther groups or organizations that deal with Kabbala h. Do you have a list of books or study materials that you could send me in English, French or Spanish? Unfortunately, there are no reputable, serious Kabb alah books written in any language other than Hebre w and Aramaic and based on authentic sources, i.e., Shimo n Bar Yochai, the Ari, Yehuda Ashlag, etc. Bnei Bar uch has created a basic course in Kabbalah through its Web site, and is publishing books for beginners in seve ral languages, including Spanish, German and Russian. The latest p ublication by Bnei Baruch, A Comprehension of the Worlds Beyond , is available in English and Russian. I was raised in a religion other than Judaism. It i s my belief there are more gods, more holy spirits, etc., than are mentioned in Kabbalah. And isn’t the purpose of creation to give man a better life in this world, as well as the world to come? I look around me and see what a terrible place this world can be. There exists only the Creator and man. The purpose of creation is to ascend to the upper worlds while being in this world. This can be done if man’s thoughts and desir es are equivalent to the desires and thoughts of th e upper worlds, a subject taught in Kabbalah. One who wants to asce nd and reach the goal of creation (which is each ma n’s personal goal in life, or he must return to this world after his death) must think positively about all creatio n. I am beginning to understand that I must take respo nsibility for my own actions, my own ego. I want to attain a more spiritual level in my life. Where do I start? And if I study Kabbalah, will I be able to act fre ely? Man must always imagine that he stands in front of God, the Super Power. Everyone who studies Kabbalah and rises to a certain spiritual level can acquire such capab ilities from this Super Power that allow him to use them as he wishes. And the greater his spiritual level, the mo re Creator-like characteristics and powers the Kabb alist achieves. Because of this, we may also say that the Kabbalist is able to act as freely and independently as the Creator. But no true Kabbalist will ever share these intimate exper iences with others. I read somewhere that there is a portion of the Kab balah that contains the 72 words or names for God a nd when read, the scripture makes known a message. Als o, when the Hebrew characters are viewed vertically , they appear in columns of three characters and each column contains a word for God. I don’t know if yo u ever noticed that God hides things in plain view, a s is the case here. Kabbalah utilizes many mathematical concepts such a s matrices, geometry, numbers, graphs, characters a nd letters, etc. These approaches are codes, shown in the Bible , which inform us of spiritual objects and the conn ection between them. Each spiritual level has its own name or number equivalent based on the sum of all lette rs in the name. The transformation of a name to a number is c alled gematria. These codes refer to spiritual leve ls that we should attain. I live in London. I am not Jewish but over the past few years I have become interested in Kabbalah and have also developed an increasing, personal interest in Judaism. Are you able to provide any guidance where by I can increase my knowledge? Do you have any represen tatives/members in the U.K. whom it would be possible to meet? There are no Kabbalists of repute living outside of Israel. However, we recommend that you begin to st udy, access our web site, and send us questions and requests."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Kabbalah seems to have ideas similar to all the major mystical traditions, such as Buddhism. Is th ere an important difference? If so, why should one choose this way and not another? If there is not, why isn’ t it acknowledged by Kabbalists? The general idea of all religious and mystical teac hings is to commune with an upper entity. Every per son comes with his own reason for seeking communion with this entity. For example, some people wish to enjoy an enriched and happy life in this world, to merit prosperity, health, confidence, a better future. They want to u nderstand this world as much as possible in order to better manage their lives. Others wish to learn how to manage in the world to come after death. All of these goals are selfish an d arise from man’s egoism. Kabbalah does not deal at all with these reasonings . Rather, Kabbalah aims to change man’s nature in o rder to enable him to have qualities similar to those of th e Creator. The Kabbalistic method states that man must use eve rything he has in this world with the intention of giving to the Creator. To reach this intention, however, man need s to sense the Creator and must feel that the Creat or enjoys his deeds. One who studies Kabbalah begins to understan d its meaning through the sensing of the Creator. Ten Kabbalah Lessons The goal of the following series of lectures is to assist you in traversing the first stages toward th e apprehension of the spiritual realm. How to Read Kabbalistic Text Hebrew Terms in the Lessons We would like to point out that it is not necessary to translate Hebrew terms used in Kabbalah into another language, since each one of t hem designates a spiritual entity (partzuf) or one of its parts. We have provided some parallel translation to assis t the English-speaking student. However, it should be emphasized that translations may lead to the association with images of our world. This is strictly forbidden because on e should not attempt to lower the spiritual to the level of our world. Terms such as Head ( Rosh) , Mouth ( Peh ), Coupling ( Zivug ), etc., could induce associations that have nothing to do with Kabbalah. Therefore, it is recommended to stick to the Hebrew denominations. Students, who do not understand Hebrew actually have an advantage over H ebrew speakers, as these terms will not bear reference to representations from our worl d. How To Read The Lessons The difficulty of explaining and teaching Kabbalah lies in the fact that the spiritual world has no counterpart in our world. Even if the objective of study becomes clear, understanding of it is only temporary. It is grasped by the spiritua l component of our cognizance, which is constantly renewed from Above. Thus, a subject once understood by an individual may again appear unclear at a later date. Depending on the mood and the spiritual state of the reader, the text can appear as either full of deep meaning, or entirely meaningless. Do not despair if what was so clear yesterday becom es very confusing the next day. Do not give up if the text appears to be vague, strange, o r illogical. Kabbalah is not studied for the sake of acquiring theoretical knowledge, but in ord er to see and to perceive. When a person begins to see and perceive, then, through his own c ontemplation and after acquiring spiritual strength, his consequent reception of the resulting spiritual lights and levels will bestow upon him a sure knowledge."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Until a person has a comprehension of the Upper Lig ht, and a perception of spiritual objects, he will not understand in what way the universe is built and works, since there are no analogies in our own world to the subject being lea rned. These lessons can help in facilitating the first st eps toward perceiving the spiritual forces. At later stages, progress can be made only with the he lp of a teacher. Lesson 1 Topics examined in this lesson: 1. Three Sources: Rashbi, Ari, Baal HaSulam 2. The Four Phases 3. Giving for the Sake of Bestowing 4. The Guest and the Host 5. Equating to the Creator 6. The Freedom of Choice 7. The First Restriction 8. Roots of Creation 9. The Structure of Spiritual Configuration: Partzuf 10. Satisfying the Desire to Receive Our knowledge of the spiritual worlds was given by people who managed to develop a perception of the u pper worlds and described the mechanisms and structures of those worlds in their writings. Methods of estab lishing contact with these worlds were also passed on. This legacy enables us to enter the spiritual worlds, a cquire the full knowledge, perceive complete perfection, understand the goal of Creation and fully grasp our existenti al purpose, while still living in this world. This course by Rav Michael Laitman, PhD is based on three sources: Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai’s Zohar wri tten in the 2 nd century CE, the works of the Ari, Rabbi Y. Luria, a Kabbalist who lived in Safed in the 16 th century, and finally, the works of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (the Baal HaSulam), who lived in the middle of the 20 th century. These three Kabbalists are one and the same soul wh ich reincarnated several times to teach an updated method leading to the mastery of the spiritual worlds, the reby easing the study of Kabbalah for the following generations. This unique soul reached its highest level during i ts last incarnation, giving life to Rabbi Yehuda As hlag, the Baal HaSulam. During its journey through our world this soul was able to provide explanations on the struct ure of the spiritual worlds beginning with the highest degrees , from the birth of the first being up to the compl etion of the correction of the universe. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag explains that the “Light emanat ing from the Creator” designates the desire to crea te beings and to please them. This phase is referred to as th e Root Phase or Phase 0. In Hebrew, it is called Behina Shoresh or Keter, as shown in Figure 1."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Figure 1. Five Behinot Afterwards this Light creates a Vessel whose desire to receive pleasure perfectly matches it. The Ligh t fills up the Vessel and pleases it. This is Phase 1, Behina Alef or Hochma . The attribute of this Light is to give, to bear the delight, while the attribute of the Vessels consis ts in receiving, experiencing pleasure. However, when the Light ente rs the Vessel, it begins to transfer to the Vessel its attributes and the Vessel wishes to become like the Light; ins tead of wanting to receive, it now wants to give wi thout restraint. At this stage, the Vessel desires to be like the Li ght, i.e. to give without restraint, and therefore it refuses to receive because it has nothing to give. This stage is calle d Phase 2, Behina Bet or Bina . Being empty of the Light, the Vessel begins to cons ider that the goal of the Light consists in creatin g a Vessel and pleasing it. Clearly, the Vessel can only experienc e pleasure if it receives a certain portion of the Light. The next phase corresponds to the desire to receive , let us say, ten percent of the Light, pleasure, b ut with an intention turned toward the Creator (bestowal). Thi s process is in fact a mixed phase, Phase 3 , Behina Gimel or Zeir Anpin . After having reached this state, consisting of thes e two antagonistic elements, the “Vessel-Desire” re alizes that it is more natural and better to receive than to give, to give without restraint. The original attribute of receiving and enjoying is rekindled. The Light of Hassadim, which has only filled ten percent of the Vessel, c annot transfer to the Vessel the attribute of giving without restraint, w hich thus leads to the predominance of the original attribute of receiving. As a result, the Vessel decides that it must fill i tself with one hundred percent pleasure, receive th e entire Light. This is Phase 4, Behina Dalet or Malchut . Such a completely filled Vessel is defined as a t rue, genuine creation since its desires come from within itself, which is different from Phase 1, in that it had no independent desire s of its own, being filled with the Light because the Creator so wished. Only at Phase 4 the true choice to receive the Ligh t emanating from the Creator is made by the created being itself. This first desire, to receive pleasure from the Lig ht, is born inside the created being. As shown in Figure 2, Hochma, Bina, Zeir Anpin and Malchut are the four phases of emanation of Light. The Lig ht of Keter emanating from the Creator is meant to form the desire to rec eive, or the true creation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Figure 2. Four Phases of Emanation of Light There is nothing in the world except for the Creato r’s desire to please and the created being’s desire to receive that pleasure. Everything is ruled by it. The entire cre ation in all its possible stages of development: in animate, vegetative, animate and speaking - everything desir es to receive a spark of the Light, to receive plea sure. The Creator has brought forth the Creation so that upon receiving the Light it may experience infinite and everlasting pleasure, not in a selfish way, but rat her in a perfect and an absolute way. If the Light enters the Vessel and fills it up completely, then this Vessel can no longer receive because the desire is saturated by the Light, and in the absence of a desire the pleasure passes away as well. It is only possible to receive endlessly when you d o not receive for your own sake, i.e. you enjoy for the sake of the giver. Then the Light entering the Vessel does not neutralize the desire to receive. Through experience we all know that when we are hun gry and begin to eat, after a certain time we no lo nger feel the hunger even if the most delicious dishes are made a vailable. Pleasure is experienced on the borderline between p leasure itself and the desire for it. However, as s oon as pleasure enters the desire and starts to satisfy it, this de sire slowly fades away. And if the pleasure is stro nger than the desire this can even lead to repulsion. How can pleasure be converted into something perfec t and unbounded? A specific scheme has been devised by the Creator. If man feels pleasure not within himself, but while pleasing others, this pleasure is infinit e because it depends solely on the amount of pleasure he can sti ll give and to whom he is giving it. The more peopl e I give it to the more pleasure do I feel myself. This condition produces an eternal existence, the perfection, whic h is one of the attributes of the Creator. This is exactly the stat e the Creator wants to usher us into. If the created being wishes exclusively to receive, it finds itself trapped in a vicious circle. It ca n feel only whatever is inside of it. If the created being could feel th e Creator’s pleasure from delighting the creation, it would endlessly experience the pleasure, just like a mother, who se lflessly gives to her children. The optimal scheme corresponds to perfection. The L ight does not only transmit simple pleasure, but in cludes pleasure procured by unlimited knowledge, infinite existence, self-knowledge and self-analysis, a feel ing of eternity and harmony, which pervades everything."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The ideal scheme includes the Creator relentlessly pouring the Light on the created being. The created being consents to receive the Light only if by doing so i t pleases the Creator. This system is referred to a s Returned Light or Reflected Light, as opposed to the Straight Ligh t emanating from the Creator. For this scheme to be, there must exist first and f oremost a desire that attracts the Straight Light t owards the created being. Secondly, the created being must place a Scr een on the Light’s path. This Screen prevents the e xperiencing of pleasure for one’s own sake and enables the created being to receive pleasure, but only in proportion to what he can give for the sake of the Creator. Then the created being becomes completely like the Creator. In other words, the following exchange takes place: the Creator procures pleasure to the created being who accepts it under the exclusive condition that by doing so it p leases the Creator. The Baal HaSulam quotes the very simple and eternal example of the guest and the host. The host presen ts to his guest a table full of delicacies. The guest sits do wn but dares not eat because he does not want to be in a position to receive and he is not certain if the host is sincer e in his desire to delight him. The guest is embarr assed because he has only to receive while the host gives. That is w hy the guest refuses what is offered in order to un derstand the host’s true desire. If the host insists, asking his guest to honor the food and assuring him that he will be very pleased if he does so, then the guest will start eating. He will do so because he is convinced that this will please the host and he no longer feels that he is receiving from the host but giving to hi m, i.e., he gives him pleasure. The roles have been reversed. Even if it is the hos t who has prepared all the food and acts as the inv iter, he clearly understands that the fulfillment of his desire to p lease depends uniquely on his guest. The guest hold s the key to the success of the dinner and consequently masters the situation. The Creator has especially made the created being i n such a way that under the influence of the Light it will feel ashamed of only receiving. The created being, using its freedom of choice freely, will reach a level w here pleasure is not experienced selfishly, so as to please the Crea tor. In this case the created being equals the Crea tor; Malchut rises to the level of Keter and acquires divine attributes. These divine attributes, these feelings are beyond description and we cannot conceive them. The entran ce into the spiritual worlds by acquiring just one degree of si militude with the Creator already means eternity, a bsolute pleasure and attainment. The science of Kabbalah studies the unfolding of Cr eation. It describes the path along which our world and all other worlds, the whole universe, must tread while achiev ing their progressive correction ( Tikkun ) to reach the level of the Creator, the ultimate degree of perfection and eter nity. We need to undertake this work of correction while living in this world, in our everyday circumstances and dress ed in our body. Kabbalists have reached this degree of perfection a nd described it for us. All souls without exception must reach this ultimate level in due time. The reincarnation of so uls in our world will carry on until the last soul has completed its way. It is only our world where the correction is p ossible in order to later on enter the spiritual wo rld and eventually reach the zero-point, or Keter . Could this process take place in one single life? N o, that is impossible. When a person is born, he re ceives a soul that has already been in this world. This soul has experienced certain stages of correction and gained experience. That’s why the people born today are much smarter a nd have more experience than previous generations. They are more prepared to function under modern technologica l and cultural conditions, various transformations taking place in modern society. In our generation, the desire to study Kabbalah has become more and more popular. S ouls have gained such a level of experience and reached such an understanding during past lives that a 20- to 25 -year-old person cannot proceed without spiritual knowledge. In the past, on the other hand, only a handful amon gst millions vaguely felt the need for spirituality. In a few years only, it will be possible to reach s piritual attainment during one’s lifetime. This is the goal of creation; it has been predetermined. Each one of us is a frag ment of the one and same Malchut (the original soul) and we are endowed with particular attributes and a specific p art to play in this world. By transforming its attr ibutes with the help of the scientific system of Kabbalah, each fra gment performs its correction in order to reach its highest degree. The fragment’s path is predefined from Above. We ar e all born in this world with a certain soul and sp ecific qualities. None of us have chosen our soul in advan ce. It goes without saying that our path is also pr edetermined. So what are we to do? Where is our free will? In what way are we intelligent beings and not simply mechan ical elements upon which such and such actions are carri ed out? To what extent did the Creator retreat to a llow us to express ourselves? He did it by requiring one impor tant condition: a man has to wish by himself to adv ance on the path of correction and elevation and may push himse lf in proportion to the strength with which he stim ulates his own desires."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Each one of us has to start from the starting point and eventually reach the final point. There is no free will for this. There is also no free will for the path because eve ryone has to go through all its phases and feelings and progressively integrate them in himself. In other w ords, we must “live” the path. Freedom means being in agreement with what happens all along the path, justifying each step and select ing the maximum speed to undergo the process of correction and bonding with the Creator. This is the only huma n- dependent factor and this is where the essence of c reation lies. To wish by himself to most quickly ge t rid of the initial condition, the way the Creator created him, to undergo a correction of attributes, and in the final point to bond to the Creator. Depending on how much man expresses this desire he may be called a man; otherwise he is a totally impe rsonal creature. Kabbalah is the only science that helps m an to develop and be an independent, individual, tr uly free personality. The four phases leading to the formation of a Kli (Vessel) can be differentiated by their desire to delight ( Aviut , thickness or coarseness). In Phase 0 (Root Phase) a nd Phase 1 this desire is absent. The more remotely the created being stands from the Creator, the stronger the des ire to delight, the coarser, the more selfish it is , the more it wants to receive. The fourth phase, Malchut , is absolutely selfish, and this desire stems from its own decision. Each subsequent phase contains the previous one: Keter is in Hochma , both are then contained in Bina , the three are in Zeir Anpin . Malchut comprises the four previous phases. Every previous phase supports the next one and provides its existe nce. The fourth phase has received all the Light, which filled it completely. We know that when the Light f ills the Vessel with pleasure, the Vessel gradually receives from t he Light its attribute to give. Malchut then begins to feel that its attribute is completely opposite to the attribute o f the Light. It becomes aware of its selfishness co mpared to the giver, which breeds such a feeling of shame that it decides to stop receiving Light and remains empty. The rejection of the Light from Malchut is called Tzimtzum Alef , the First Restriction. Once Malchut is empty, a state of equilibrium with the giver sets in; neithe r of them receives or gives, there is no reciprocal pleasure. So how can Malchut possibly equal the Creator? By imitating the example of the guest and the host, Malchut pushes away all the incoming Light because it does not want to feel as the receiver. Then it sets the cond ition that it will accept a portion of the Light, t hough not for its own delight, but because it wants to please the Creator , as it knows that the Creator wishes its delight. Receiving in such a way is like giving, so Malchut is now in a position to be the giver. We can see that the Light needs to undergo four pha ses if a true desire is to be brought to life. The same process takes place with all our desires whatever they are. Prior to the manifestation of a desire within us, this desire goes through all the phases of development of Light eman ating from the Creator, until we finally feel it. N o desire can emerge without Light. Light comes first, the desire afterwards. Let us examine the structure of Creation created du ring Phase 4 (see Figure 3). The Light emanating fr om the Creator is called Straight Light ( Ohr Yashar ), the Light Malchut pushes away is called the Reflected Light ( Ohr Hozer ) and finally the Light entering partially into the Vessel is called Inner Light ( Ohr Pnimi )."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Figure 3. The Vessel When the guest faces the host and the table full of delicacies he first refuses everything, then decid es to eat a bit in order to please the host even though he would like to gulp everything down in one go. This means that one must use his selfish desires, but in an altruistic way. As t he guest starts to consider things, he understands that he cannot accept the whole dinner for the sake of the host; h e only may accept a small portion of it. This is why the created being, after having perform ed a restriction, can accept with altruism a small portion of the Light, let’s say 20%, but it pushes away the remain ing 80%. The part of the created being that makes a decision on how much Light it may accept inside for the sake of the Creator is called Rosh (Head). The part accepting the Light is called Toch (Inner part) and the last part, which remains empt y, is called Sof (End). This is the place where the created being performs a restriction and no longer accepts the Light."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Figure 4. The Partzuf Different terms are attributed to the various parts of creation using analogies with the human body. T here are no terms, labels and numbers in the spiritual worlds. It is nevertheless easier and more convenient to us e words. Kabbalists have chosen to express themselves in a v ery simple language: given the fact that everything in our world results from the spiritual worlds, in accordance wi th the direct connections descending from Above dow nward, from every spiritual object to every object in our world . Then for everything that has a name in our world, we may take the name of an object of our world and use it to de signate the spiritual object that begets it. Let’s take the example of a stone in our world. The re is a force Above which generates this stone: it will therefore be named “stone.” The only difference is that the “spi ritual stone” is a spiritual root endowed with spec ific attributes, which in turn matches a branch in our world, labele d “stone,” a material object. This is how the langu age of branches was created. By means of names, denominati ons and actions of our world we can refer back to e lements and actions in the spiritual worlds. None of the authentic Kabbalah scripts mention our world, not in a single word, although they may be u sing the language of our world. Every object of our world re fers to a matching object in the spiritual worlds. Hence the region of a spiritual object responsible for analysis and consideration is called Head ( Rosh ), see Figure 4. The part of the Screen located above Malchut and which lets the Light to enter inside is called Mouth ( Peh ). The part where the Light enters is called Body ( Guf ). The line exerting a restriction, inside the Guf , is called Navel ( Tabur ). The lowest part, which is devoid of Light, is ca lled Conclusion ( Sium ). This object as a whole constitutes the Creation, the soul, Malchut . Thus, after having received twenty percent of the L ight in Toch , the region of Guf where the light is actually felt, the Partzuf begins to feel the pressure exerted from outside b y the Surrounding Light, the Ohr Makif . It says: “You see how pleasant it is to accept a portion of the Light , you do not know how much pleasure remains outside , just try to accept some more.” We can understand that it is bet ter not to experience pleasure at all than to exper ience just a tiny bit of it. Pleasure exerts pressure both from outsi de and inside and it therefore becomes much more di fficult to oppose. While it was not accepting any Light at all, the Partzuf could remain in that state for a long time, but no w the Light exerts pressure both from inside and outside. If th e Partzuf accepts some more Light, this means acting for its own delight, because the strength of its resistance to selfishness equals only twenty percent. The Partzuf declines to do"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"so. It did perform the First Restriction, not to ac t later on in such a way. This would be totally ina ppropriate. There is only a single solution, which consists in rejecting the Light in order to revert to the initial state, the way it was before accepting the Light (see Figure 4). And this is exactly what the Partzuf does. The pressure exerted simultaneously by the Ohr Pnimi and the Ohr Makif on the Tabur is termed “ Bitush Pnim uMakif ” (Blow from Inside and Outside). How does the spreading of the Light (twenty percent in this case) inside the Guf take place? The Screen, which was initially positioned on the level of Peh de Rosh (the Mouth of the Head), is brought down by the Li ght’s pressure by twenty percent below the Peh into the Guf , until it reaches the line of the Tabur . When the Light is expelled from the Guf , the Screen rises progressively from the Tabur to the Peh de Rosh , pushing the Light away. Before the spreading of the Light i nside the Guf , the Partzuf had all information available in the Rosh . It knew what kind of Light it is, what kind of de light it brings, it knew what its own desire is, an d how strong its force is opposed to the delight for its own sak e. According to all this information, as well as the i nformation remaining from the state when the Partzuf was filled with Light, and from the state following the restri ction of the Light, the Partzuf keeps a memory of the past - an imprint, which is called Reshimo . What exists in the spiritual? Nothing but the desir e to delight and the delights satisfying this desir e. The information about the desire per se in the Partzuf is called Aviut, and the information corresponding to the Light, whi ch would clothe itself with a Kli (Vessel), is called Hitlabshut . One can justly say that there is only the Creator and Creation. From the previous state there always remain a Reshimo of Hitlabshut and a Reshimo of Aviut . These two parameters are sufficient to define the previous state of the Partzuf . After having rejected the Light, a Partzuf knows precisely what it felt when the Light resided in its Guf . With this experience it knows how to act and what sort of calculations it has to carry out. The Partzuf , shown in Figure 5 below, understands that it is n o longer possible to retain twenty percent of the L ight. The decision is made to taste fifteen percent of it for the sake of the Creator. Figure 5. Five Partzufim: Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA, BON For this to happen, the Partzuf needs to move down a bit so that its Rosh and Peh will be positioned below the level of the previous Partzuf . The Light hitting the Screen is pushed away, and only perhaps fifteen percent gets in."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"How are the Hitlabshut and the Aviut determined? The calculation begins in the World of Ein Sof (the World of Infinity), where Malchut ( Aviut Dalet , Desire of Level 4) is totally filled with the cor responding Light ( Hitlabshut Dalet , Light of Level 4). This state of Malchut is shortly characterized by “ Dalet-Dalet, ” and is denoted by (4,4). The next Partzuf retains the data that now it is capable to fill it self up with Light, which corresponds only to Aviut Gimel , Desire of Level 3, and so on. Each of the following Partzufim lowers its capacity to fill its Guf with Light for the sake of the Creator more and more. Altogether there are 25 Partzufim, which emerge from above to below. When the turn of the last Partzuf arrives, its lower part crosses the separating line, the Barrier ( Machsom ) between the spiritual world and our world, and be gins to shine in our world. Our world is a state of Malchut characterized by the absence of a Screen. Lesson 2 Topics examined in this lesson: 11. The Goal of Creation 12. Inanimate, Vegetative, Animate, Speaking 13.

Five Parts of Adam Kadmon Man was created for receiving unlimited and absolut e Delight. But to reach such a condition man needs to know how the system of worlds operates. The laws of this world are issued from the spiritua l worlds. There our souls were before our birth, an d there our souls return after life. We are interested only in this particular time peri od when we are in our physical body and how Kabbala h can teach us the best way to live this life. Kabbalah tells us how to use to its fullest everyth ing that happens to us. To ascend spiritually, man needs to know everything and use absolutely all the possibilities he is offered. We have to grasp the nature of our world: inanimate , vegetative, animate and speaking. We need to unde rstand our soul, as well as the laws that describe its develop ment. According to the law of spiritual development, man has to reach the highest spiritual degree in this l ife. Man will be given many opportunities, if not in his present lif e then in the next one, and so on, until he reaches the required level. Kabbalah helps us to accelerate this process. The C reator designed a very interesting system: either m an accepts to ponder the meaning of life without awaiting any suf ferings, or such sufferings will be sent to him so that he may be coerced into asking himself questions. In other words, no matter whether man progresses to wards the goal of Creation voluntarily or by force, Kabbalah assists him to advance by his own will. This is the optimal way and man may enjoy it while advancing. There are those who pose the question: Can Kabbalah help cover a mortgage loan, assist one in business , to be successful in family matters, and so on? Actually, Kabbalah does not give an unambiguous ans wer on these questions. Kabbalah teaches us how to use our entire world, in the most effective way, for the ac hievement of the goal of creation. This is the dire ction in which the Creator pushes us, using all these troubles. Kabbalah explains what spiritual load a man must ta ke out of his life. Not how to solve our problems, but how to find a solution to the very problem for which all o ur everyday problems are sent to us. Suffering is j ust put in our way to bring us to our spiritual ascent. When man discovers all the laws of the spiritual wo rlds, he knows what is sent to him from above and w hy, how to use these challenges in the most optimal way and ho w to behave correctly. We basically do not grasp what to do when something befalls us – where to run, who to call? Solving ou r daily problems straightforwardly, trying to escape them a s we are used to doing, will not advance us to the goal but will create new difficulties. These will only disappear when their purpose is fulfilled by drawing us close r to the goal of creation."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"By knowing the spiritual laws, we are enabled to se e all the causes and consequences. We observe every thing through the correct perspective, we see all the lin ks. This way each of our steps becomes a conscious one. Life changes and no longer seems to lead to a dead end. We join together all our conditions prior to birth, du ring our present lifetime, and after we leave this world. We reach a completely new level of existence. Currently, many people are beginning to think about the meaning of life and other spiritual matters. T his happens because of the past experiences that have accumulat ed in their souls during their previous lifetimes. The Creator sends suffering in order to allow man t o meditate on the essence of these sufferings and t heir origin. Thus, man is able to call upon the Creator, still w ithout understanding it. The Creator expects us to cultivate the desire to bond with Him. However, when man takes the correct guidebook in hi s hands, he may progress through assiduous study, w ithout being coerced by sufferings. By choosing the correct path, man feels the same su ffering as pleasure; he progresses more quickly and gets ahead of it, while comprehending its purpose and origin. Thus the Creator turns into a source of delight rat her than, as previously, being the source of suffer ing. The pace of our advancement along this path depends solely on u s. The Creator created delight for us, but in order to make us use it correctly, he has to urge us on. St riving for a pleasure that cannot be reached makes us suffer. We are ready to run after it, wherever it is. In other words, suffering is the absence of satisfa ction. But no chase after delight will bring anythi ng good. The moment we receive it, we lose interest in it and we jump over to something else. Delight vanishes the moment we receive it. It is im possible for suffering to be filled with delight in our world. We sense delight only on the edge between suffering an d delight, when the first sensation is felt. The pu rsuit of satisfaction increasingly tarnishes delight. This method of being satisfied is perverted and unf it. In order to receive eternal delight, we need to learn how to give to somebody. Knowing that the Creator wants to delight us is our only reason for experiencing it, so that we can please Him and not seek self-satisfaction. We need to receive for the sake of giving. It is difficult, almost impossible to speak about t his process for the lack of words. Proper understan ding comes only when the Creator reveals Himself. People begin to sense the Creator after crossing th e Machsom – the Barrier between our world and the spiritual worlds. That comes 6,000 steps before Gmar Tikkun – Final Correction. Each spiritual step presents a degree of the Creator’s unveiling. Final Correction follows the correction of all man’ s desires. The first stage in studying Kabbalah consists in re ading as many pertinent books as possible and “dige sting” as much knowledge as possible. The next stage is group work, when the student’s an d group’s desires merge. The student’s Vessel enlar ges proportionately to the number of group members. Man starts feeling outside of his individual intere sts. In our case it is the group that symbolizes th e Creator, since everything located outside man is the Creator. Noth ing exists except for the Creator and oneself. Basi cally, all spiritual work both starts and ends within the fram ework of a group. Throughout time, Kabbalists have had groups. Only w ithin the framework of a group and based on the mut ual ties fostered by its members can students advance in the ir understanding of the spiritual worlds. Gmar Tikkun is the condition when all of mankind turns into on e single Kabbalistic group. There is still a long way to go, although every day it becomes more realistic. In any event, at the hi ghest spiritual levels everything is ready for this attainment – al l the roots, all the forces. In general we study two stages: (i) the descent of the created being from above, while it develops fro m the very idea, as conceived by the Creator, up to the level of our world and (ii) the ascent of man from our world al l the way to the highest degree. We do not mean any actual physical movement, because our body remains on this material plane, but in a spiritual way, as a result of our efforts and development. In the Partzuf shown above (in Figure 4) there are two conditions : (i) when it receives Light and enjoys, this Kli (Vessel) is called Hochma . (ii) when the Kli wants to give and also enjoys, then it is called Bina . These two Vessels are opposite. In fact there also exists a third condition, the mi xed one. This is where the Vessel receives a portio n for the Creator’s sake but still remains partly empty. Such a conditi on is called Zeir Anpin . Here we have 10% of the Light of Hochma and 90% of the Light of Hassadim ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"If there is Light of Hochma in the Vessel, such a condition is called Panim (Face). It is small or big, depending on the quantity of the Light of Hochma . The final stage, Malchut, is the genuine desire to receive - the created bei ng - because it is eager to receive the Light of Hochma . The Light therefore completely fills Malchut . This condition of Malchut is called Ein Sof , the World of Infinity, i.e., unlimited receiving. Afterwards, Malchut , still willing to receive the Light, decides not t o use this will. It understands that desire to receive for its own sake moves it away from the Cre ator. Therefore it makes its First Restriction and pushes the Light away and remains empty. By giving the Light away, Malchut likens its attributes to the Creator’s. The delight of giving away is felt as absolute and complete. The delight does not disappear because th e giver endlessly feels the receiver while giving to him an d thus sending him pleasure. While doing so the Kli is able to endlessly feel the delight with regards to both qua ntity and quality. It is understood that when the Creator created Vess els, He organized them in such a way that they prog ressively absorbed the Light’s attribute of giving relentless ly and thereby became similar to the Light. One may pose the question, how can Malchut be similar to the Light and still receive delight? We stated previously that Malchut puts an anti-egoistic Screen on all its desires. O ne hundred percent of Light- Delight is placed in front of it, according to Malchut ’s desire to receive, e.g. 100 kg. Using a Screen o f 100 kg (the force that counteracts its wish to receive Delight) , Malchut pushes away all the Delight and decides to receive as much Light as necessary to please the Creator. Such receiving of Light is equal to giving without restraint. The Light which comes to Malchut is called Ohr Yashar (Straight Light). All the Light which is reflected is called Ohr Hozer (Returning Light). The twenty percent of the Light which enters inside is called Ohr Pnimi (Inner Light). The greatest part of the Light left outside is call ed Ohr Makif (Surrounding Light). In the lower part of Malchut , where Ohr Hochma has not entered, there is Ohr Hassadim . From the condition of Malchut in the World of Ein Sof , there remains a Reshimo . This Reshimo is composed of: (i) Dalet de Hitlabshut (information about the quality and quantity of Lig ht) and (ii) Dalet de Aviut (information about the force of desire). Using these two kinds of memory, Malchut carries out the calculation in its Rosh that it is able to receive the first twenty percent of Light for the sake of the Creator . In order to feel the spiritual shame resulting from receiving, without giving in return, it is necessa ry first of all to perceive the Creator, His properties, to feel Him a s the Giver, to see His glory. Then the comparison between His properties and one’s egoistic nature will bring abo ut the feeling of shame. But in order to arrive at this perception, one has a lot to learn. As the glory of the Creator gradual ly unfolds, a desire to do something for Him appears. To give to the Superior is like receiving. We may a lso observe this in our world. If someone has the o pportunity to do a favor to a great person, he will do it with pl easure and enjoyment. The aim of all our work is the revelation of the Cr eator: His Glory and Might. Once this level is reac hed, what we witness will serve us as the source of energy in or der to do something for the Creator’s benefit. This revelation of the Creator, it should be emphas ized, will occur only when a man has already acquir ed a definite desire to use it only for altruistic purpose, i.e., for attaining the altruistic attributes. The first Partzuf that received a portion of the Light is called Galgalta . After Bitush Pnim uMakif i.e., being struck by both Lights, Ohr Pnimi and Ohr Makif, on the Screen at the Tabur (Navel), the Partzuf realizes that it will not be able to resist the delights of the Light that press es from outside. The Partzuf decides to push the Light away. In the current sta te this decision does not pose any problem because none of the delights are felt by the Partzuf . After the forcing out of the Light, the Screen rise s, weakens and joins the Peh (Mouth) of Rosh (Head). This action is called Hizdakchut (Refinement). When, on the contrary, under the effect of the Ligh t the Screen goes down, its Aviut (coarseness) increases. After the forcing out of the Light from the first Partzuf , there remained Reshimot : Dalet de Hitlabshut (information about the quality and quantity of Light) and Gimel de Aviut (information about the force of desire). One measu re of Aviut disappeared, because the Partzuf realized that it is impossible to work with the fo rmer degree of Dalet . According to Aviut Gimel , the Screen descends from Peh de Rosh to the level lower than that of Aviut Dalet . If the level of Dalet is Peh of the Partzuf of Galgalta , then the level of Gimel is its Hazeh . Once again the Light presses the Screen from above, the Screen pushes it back, but afterwards, under t he influence of the Reshimot (plural of Reshimo ) it decides to accept the Light up to the Tabur of Galgalta but not beneath."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"However, not even the Partzuf of Galgalta was able to receive the Light under its Tabur . The second Partzuf , which is now spreading out, is called AB . Again the action of Bitush Pnim uMakif occurs, i.e. the forcing out of the Light, and new information, Reshimo , now fills the Partzuf . This is Gimel de Hitlabshut (Light of the third level, not the fourth, as in AB ) and Bet de Aviut (again the loss of one level of Aviut owing to Bitush Pnim uMakif ). That is why the Screen, which ascended initially up to the Peh of AB when the Light was pushed away, now descends to the level of Hazeh of AB . At this point a new Partzuf is formed by a Zivug (Coupling) on the Reshimot of Gimel - Bet (3,2). The new Partzuf is called SAG . Further on a new Bitush Pnim uMakif makes the Screen rise up to the Peh de Rosh of SAG with the Reshimot of Bet - Alef (2,1). Then, according to the Reshimot , the Screen descends to the Hazeh of SAG , from where the fourth Partzuf , MA , comes out. Next, the fifth Partzuf , BON is formed on the Reshimot of Alef-Shoresh . Each Partzuf consists of five parts: Shoresh (Root), Alef (1), Bet (2), Gimel (3) and Dalet (4). No desire may appear without them. This formation is a rigid system whic h never changes. The last stage, Dalet , feels all the four previous desires, with whose h elp it was created by the Creator. Dalet gives a name to each desire, and it is those names which de scribe how Dalet sees the Creator at each moment. This is why Dalet itself is called by the name of the Creator: “Yood -Hay-Vav-Hay” – Y-H-V-H. These letters will be studied comprehensively further on. It is like t he skeleton of a man, it may be big or small, stand ing or sitting, but it remains the same thing. If a Partzuf is filled with the Light of Hochma , it is called AB , but if it is filled with the Light of Hassadim , we call it SAG . All the names of the Partzufim are based on the combination of these two Lights. All that is described in the Torah is nothing more than spiritual Partzufim , filled with either the Light of Hochma or the Light of Hassadim in different proportions. After the birth of the five Partzufim : Galgalta , AB , SAG , MA and BON , all the Reshimot disappear. All the desires that could be filled with the Light, for the benefi t of the Creator, have been exhausted. At this stage, the Screen completely loses the abil ity to receive Light for the Creator and can only r esist egoism without receiving anything. We see that after the First Restriction, Malchut can consequently receive five portions of the Ligh t. The birth of the five Partzufim is called the World of Adam Kadmon . Malchut has completed its five Reshimot . We see that Malchut of the World of Ein Sof is completely filled with Light. After the First R estriction, with the help of the Partzufim , it will only fill partially up to the level of th e Tabur . The task for Malchut is now filling its last part for the sake of the C reator as well. This part is called Sof (End) and spreads from the Tabur to Sium Raglin (Conclusion of Legs). The Creator wants to fill Malchut with unlimited delight. All that is needed to achi eve this is to create the conditions so that Malchut will have the desire and the power to fill the rem aining part or in other words: to send the delight back to the Creator. In the next chapter we shall see how this process t akes place. Lesson 3 Topics examined in this lesson: 21. 5 Senses 22. Revelation 23. Amendments in Spiritual Worlds 24. Attracting the Surrounding Light 25. Correcting the Ego 26. An Exit to the Spiritual Worlds Even an insignificant change in our senses will sig nificantly modify our perception of reality and our world. Everything we sense is called the Creation. As our sensations are subjective, the picture we build is also subjective. Scientists try to expand the limits of our senses ( with microscopes, telescopes, all kinds of sensors, and so on), but all these aids do not change the essence of our per ceptions. It is as if we are imprisoned by our sensory organs . All the incoming information penetrates us throug h the five sensors: visual, auditory, tactual, gustatory and o lfactory."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The received information undergoes some processing inside a person, is sensed and assessed following o ne algorithm: is it better or worse for me. From above, we are given the opportunity to create a sixth organ of sensation. This is acquired with t he help of the science of Kabbalah. If we study it correctly, using authentic sources i n a group of like-minded people and under the guida nce of an authentic teacher, we can qualitatively modify our organs of sensation and discover the spiritual worl d and the Creator. Kabbalah teaches that the only thing created is the desire to have pleasure and delight. Our brain is aimed only at the development of this sensation, measuring it correct ly. The brain is an auxiliary appliance, nothing mo re. The result of studying Kabbalah correctly is a comp rehensive and thorough experience of the true unive rse, as clear as our present perception of our world. The perception of both worlds gives us a full and l arge-scale picture, including the highest force, th e Creator who rules the entire universe. Kabbalah is talking about new sensations and feelin gs perceived by man; they appear not in man’s brain but in his heart. The heart reacts to man’s inner reactions ev en though it is simply a pump. In fact our sensations – feelings – are a pure spir itual substance. The various organs that enable us to “live” them are also of a spiritual nature. The heart simply reacts , since it operates to provide energy to the body i n accordance with our various reactions. In our initial condition, we simply do not understa nd or perceive that something is hidden from us. Ye t if during our studies we begin to appreciate this fact, it alread y becomes a step forward in the right direction. Further on, we begin to perceive a higher force, wh ich establishes contact with us, sends us different situations, and their causes and effects become clearer. This alrea dy is a certain degree of revelation. A person begins to evaluate his own deeds in accord ance with what the Creator sends him. One begins to criticize one’s own actions and reactions. He thinks “This is sent to me by the Creator so tha t I could let it go” or “In this case I have to beh ave differently.” Such self-criticism transports a man to the level o f “Man” because he has become more than merely the two-legged creature he was before. The man starts sensing the Creator, and sees which actions are useful to him and which are harmful. As man sees all the due causes and effects, he begi ns to know what is useful and what is not. Naturall y, nobody will consciously violate something while he sees what br ings him a reward and what leads to a punishment. Therefore, the revelation of the Creator grants man the opportunity to behave correctly in each specif ic case with maximum benefit. Such a man is then called a tzadik , a righteous man. He perceives the Creator, the re ward for all good, as well as the additional reward for not viol ating a commandment. A righteous man always justifies the Creator. When a man increasingly performs spiritual commandments, more and more light enters him. This inner light is called Torah . On further revelation of the Creator, man ascends t he spiritual ladder and on each rung he performs a spiritual commandment, and receives, in turn, a new portion o f light. He becomes more righteous until he reaches such a l evel where it is possible for him to perform comman dments regardless of himself, however good or bad this mig ht be for him. Man sees the Creator as absolutely kind and all His actions as perfect. All this is the result of a ce rtain degree of revelation of the Creator. As he moves along the 6,000 steps, man realizes tha t everything the Creator does to him and to his fel low men stems from the desire to endlessly delight all created be ings. Man is then overcome by a feeling of endless gratitude and a desire to thank the Creator through all his actions . These actions aim at giving to the Creator. This me ans doing more and more to please the Creator. Such a condition is called the condition of eternal and endless love for the Creator. At this stage man understands that the Creator only wished him good in the past. Before, when man was in his uncorrected condition, he believed that the Creator often put him in trouble, brought him grief. The Light of the Almighty is unchanging, but when i t enters an antagonistic desire it arouses an antag onistic feeling. The spiritual world is perceived only on the edge o f positive and negative conditions. One should not fear any situation that may occur. When one commences to study Kabbalah, suddenly prob lems, previously unknown, begin to crop up. Without the learning of Kabbalah this would have taken a number of years. Now, the process has just been accelerat ed. For this occurrence, one may use the ratio of one d ay for ten years. This does not mean that the numbe r of events planned for everybody is reduced. Rather, that the speed of their occurrence is compressed over a shor ter span of time."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"If a student attends the group lectures and listens correctly, while lessening his ego, his pride and superficial knowledge, he will begin to delve into what he hear s and pay more attention to it. We study the process of emanation of the worlds fro m above to below, in order to draw the spiritual Li ght in relation to the material studied. This Light gradually cleanses our Vessels, corrects them and renders them altruistic. We have students who have been studying for ten yea rs together with those who have commenced just a fe w months ago, but everyone is able to advance accordingly wi thout hindrance. Actually, today students come with a greater desire to understand everything; their souls are more exp erienced and prepared. For the length of time you study Kabbalah is not im portant in itself. What is most important is to wha t extent the student bonds with the group’s desire, how he merge s with it and humbles himself with respect. Due to this bonding with the group, it is possible to reach, after a fe w hours, spiritual levels that would have taken yea rs to attain through one’s own efforts. One needs to avoid pseudo-Kabbalists, religious fan atics who are miles away from true Kabbalah. One mu st study authentic literature only, and belong to a single g roup headed by one teacher. When I discovered Kabbalah, I wanted to find out ho w our world, the cosmos, the planets, the stars and so on are designed. Whether there is life out in space, what the correlation is between all these aspects. I was interested in various forms of biological lif e and their meaning. My specialization is biologica l cybernetics. I wanted to uncover the system of the regulation of o rganisms. While following this path I was urged from above to ward Kabbalah. As I learned more and more, I became less and less interested in such matters. I began to underst and that Kabbalah does not deal with the biological body, its life and death, which are unrelated to the spiritual sph ere. The spiritual world permeates our material world an d shapes everything existing in it: inanimate, vege tative, animal and human. Thanks to Kabbalah our world can be studied correct ly by understanding its spiritual roots and their i nteraction with it. For example, the study of Talmud Esser HaSefirot , composed by the Baal HaSulam, tells us about the birth of the soul in the spiritual worlds. If one reads it word for word, it does not differ from the conception of a human being in his mother’s womb, the periods of pregnancy, birth and feeding. It sounds like pure medicine. One then begins to grasp why we perceive in our wor ld such consequences of the spiritual laws of devel opment. The development of the soul is explained in a language that describes the development of the body in our w orld. The various types of horoscopes, astrology and pred ictions have nothing to do with Kabbalah. They are related to the body and its animal property to sense different things. Dogs and cats can also feel the approachin g of some natural phenomena. In present times many people rush to use so called “New Age” techniques, trying to change themselves, their lives and their destinies. Destiny may be changed, in fac t, if you exert influence on your soul and learn ho w to control it. When studying the laws of the spiritual world we be gin to understand the laws of our world. Most scien ces, such as physics, chemistry, biology, etc. become simpler an d more intelligible when viewed from the viewpoint of Kabbalah. Still, when man reaches the appropriate spiritual l evel, he does not care so much for material science s, which are less organized. Substances that are spiritually org anized now become of paramount interest and importa nce. A Kabbalist dreams to rise above his present level but not to go down. Any Kabbalist may perceive the roots of development of all sciences, if he wishes. The Baal HaSulam, Rabbi Ashlag, sometimes wrote abo ut the correlation between spiritual and material s ciences. A great Kabbalist, the Gaon of Vilna, enjoyed making comparisons between spiritual and material laws. He even wrote a book on geometry. Perceiving one of the highest s piritual worlds, he was able to draw a connection d irectly from there down to the science of our world. As for us, having no idea of the spiritual worlds, we shall simply read these books by pronouncing wor ds. But even by just pronouncing these words, we are in visibly linking ourselves to the spiritual by attra cting Ohr Makif (Surrounding Light) from a certain level where the author was. When reading the books of the genuine K abbalists, we allow the Ohr Makif to drive us forward. The diversity of levels and types of Kabbalist soul s accounts for the variety of styles expressed in K abbalistic works, as well as the various degrees of Light intensity w e may draw while studying them. However, the Light emanating from the various books of the Torah, and amongst them, from its special p art, Kabbalah, does always exist."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Kabbalist Moses wrote a book about the wanderin g of his people in the desert. If we only take thes e writings literally as stories, then the Torah will have no i mpact on us. But if we delve deeper, and understand what is trul y described there, then the Five Books become a Kab balistic revelation, wherein all the degrees of understandin g of the spiritual worlds are expounded. This is ex actly what Moses wanted to pass on. The same relates to King Solomon’s “Song of Songs.” Everything depends on how it is read and perceived . Either just as a love song or as a spiritual revelation, o n which the Zohar comments as the highest connectio n to the Creator. It is important to find authentic Kabbalistic sourc es whose content will induce thoughts about the Cre ator and the goal that needs to be reached. Then there is no dou bt you will reach it. The sources that divert one from the true goal will not bring any good. The Surrounding Light, Ohr Makif , is drawn according to one’s desire. The Light will not shine if one’s desire does not aim at a genuine goal. We speak of the number 600,000 souls; where does th is originate? From a Partzuf made of 6 Sefirot , each one of them is in turn composed of 10. This Partzuf has risen to the level of 10,000. Hence the number 600,000. We constantly breed different desires, whatever the y are. Our development depends on the level of thes e desires. In the beginning our desires are on the lowest leve l, the so-called animal desires. Later these are fo llowed by desires for wealth, honor, social position and so on. On a higher level are the desires for knowledge, mu sic, art, culture, etc. Finally, we find the more e levated desire for spirituality. Such desires gradually appear in the souls after ma ny incarnations in this world or, as we say, with t he development of generations. First the souls living exclusively in their animal nature life were incarnated in our world. Then, nex t generations of souls experienced the desire for money, honor and p ower. Finally, these gave way to the desire for sci ences and for something higher that the sciences cannot provide. It is impossible for man to experience two differen t desires because this would mean that they have no t been properly defined. After they are carefully analyzed and sorted, it ap pears to be the one and only desire. A man receives several desires simultaneously. He then selects only one of them if he is able to correctly assess his level. The spiritual Vessel ( Kli ) broke into 600,000 parts and lost its Screen. Now the Screen is to be rebuilt and the broken parts themselves must perform this task, so that th ey can “live” the path of return, feel what they ar e and create the Creator out of themselves. The spiritual Vessel consists of two parts: one kin d ranges from Peh down to Tabur and is called Kelim de Ashpa’a (Vessels of bestowing); they correspond to the desi res to give without restraint. Even though they are internally selfish, they opera te according to the principle of giving without res traint. The second part ranges from Tabur down and it is composed of purely selfish desires which operate for receiving, not giving, and they are called Kelim de Kabbalah (Vessels of Receiving). The point of the matter is not that the upper desir es are good, and the lower desires bad, but that th e upper desires are “small,” and the lower desires “big.” For this reason there is a Screen on the upper desi res as opposed to the lower ones. The upper part of the Partzuf is called Galgalta ve Eynaim , the lower part is called AHP . The weaker desires undergo their correction first; they do not require much time for this process. The n the desires under Tabur are corrected, these are more selfish. The altruistic desires called Galgalta ve Eynaim need to be corrected first and next the egoistic d esires called AHP . At the end of this process everything merges back i nto one common Kli . That is why the difference between the altruistic Vessels and the egoistic all comes down to the timing of correction. The time for Galgalta ve Eynaim ’s correction has come and their desires are expose d. They have reached a higher degree of development. On the other hand, the AHP cannot proceed to the correction of their desires as these are still hidden in a latent state. But when the time comes, we will realize how much b igger are the AHP s’ desires compared to Galgalta ve Eynaim ’s. As soon as these souls begin their correction, the already corrected souls of Galgalta ve Eynaim will be able to rise thanks to them. The egoistic Kelim , the AHP , by virtue of their forthcoming correction, place high demands on Galgalta ve Eynaim , the altruistic Kelim . Many of the latter have not yet started their cor rection and obstruct the correction of the former. In order to reach the spiritual world, our generati on needs to read very specific literature. Today it is the Talmud Esser HaSefirot . 500 years ago, it was books written by the Ari, R abbi Isaac Luria. Before the Ari it was the Book of Zohar."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Each generation is offered a special book serving a s a key to enter the spiritual world. This book cor responds to the development of the souls of the given generation. Once a person actually reaches the spiritual world, he may read all the books because he now sees that each one of them is suitable for him. Matching the spiritual world, achieving its attribu tes, means observing internally all its laws. As a consequence, the soul evolves. When the time of complete attainment comes: all wor lds – spiritual and material – will merge into a si ngle whole. Man will then be able to live in all worlds at the same time.

Place of Atzilut Having journeyed thus far toward the goal of learni ng Kabbalah, we urge the student not to fall by the wayside due to difficulties with some of the technical nature o f our explanations. Through an earnest desire for true knowledge of the wisdom of Kabbalah, the student will be assisted f rom above through an awakening of the Ohr Makif (Surrounding Light). When the time is right, the student will further hi s studies under the guidance of a qualified teacher as part of a group. The important aspect is to bear in mind the level m an needs to attain in order to give completely and not to receive anything for himself. Then the person has reached completion, with a true deveikut (attachment). This is the goal of creation, and ma n was created just for this. To return to our narrative: We wrote concerning the Light entering and leaving the Partzuf . Here we are discussing a fulfilled and unfulfilled desire. When the Light enters the Partzuf this corresponds to the fulfillment of a desire, t o a feeling of wholeness and delight. When the Light leaves the Partzuf there remains a void or frustration. This happens in spite of the fact that there is no such thing as a feeling of void in the spiritual world. If the Ohr Hochma exits, the Ohr Hassadim remains. Each time the Partzuf pushes the Light away, it knowingly understands where it is heading by refusing a certa in amount of pleasure. In the spiritual context, a selfish enjoyment is wi llingly refused and replaced by altruistic enjoymen t in nature, which is much higher and stronger. If the Partzuf perceives that it is unable to receive so as to pl ease the Master, it will refuse to receive for itse lf. It goes without saying that in order to make such a decision, some help, as well as a force opposing s elfishness are required. This decisive role is played by the Scree n ( Masach ). With a Screen, the Kli (Vessel) begins to perceive the Light instead of d arkness. The quantity of Light which is revealed is proportional to the strength of the Scr een. Without a Screen, the Light does not allow any altruistic action. It is precisely the absence of Light during the First Restriction, operated by the Kli , which enables it to build a Screen. By this means, it can allow the Light to enter. A d esire can be considered spiritual only when the Scr een is duly positioned. We have previously studied the five Partzufim of the World of Adam Kadmon . As already outlined, the main task for a student of Kabbalah is to attain the Light, t hat is to say, the filling of the Partzuf , the soul, by the Light. As soon as the Light enters the Kli , it immediately starts acting upon it and transmit s to the Kli its own altruistic attributes, i.e., the ability to give. Man then realizes what he is in comparison to the L ight and begins to feel ashamed of receiving it; th is makes him wish to resemble the Light."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The strength of the Divine Light cannot modify the nature of the Kli the Creator Himself has created; it can only change the orientation of its utilization: from sel f-aimed pleasure into pleasure for the sake of the Creator. Such a scheme of utilizing the Kli is called “receiving for the sake of giving.” It a llows Malchut to completely enjoy receiving the Light, while returning this delight t o the Creator. It then continues to enjoy, sharing now the Creator’s delight. During the first phase ( Behina Alef ) of the progression of the Straight Light ( Ohr Yashar ), Malchut only received pleasure from the Light that filled it. However, because of the path followed by the Light all the way down from the World Without End ( Olam Ein Sof ) to our world, and conversely all the way back to th e World Without End, but this time using a Screen, Malchut again fills up with all the Light, but with an intention turned toward the Creator. This makes it reach an e ndless delight. Thanks to this process, all its desires, both the l owest and the highest, lead to never-ending delight . This is also designated by the expression “feeling of completene ss and unity.” The five Partzufim of the World of Adam Kadmon have used all the Reshimot (Records) of the World of Ein Sof , by which it was possible to fill Malchut up to the Tabur . Of course there still remain very powerful desires below the Tabur of Galgalta . These desires are not endowed with a Screen and the refore cannot be filled with the Light. If we succe eded in filling up the lower part of Galgalta with the Light, the Gmar Tikkun (the Final Correction) would take place. In order to complete this task, a new Partzuf, the Nekudot de SAG, which comes out while the Light is exiting the Partzuf of SAG , descends below the Tabur of Galgalta We know that Galgalta bears the name of Keter , AB the name of Hochma , SAG : Bina , MA : Zeir Anpin , BON : Malchut . The Partzuf of Bina is a Partzuf which may spread in every place. It has only the d esire to give, it does not need any Ohr Hochma ; its attribute is to give without restraint, Ohr Hassadim . SAG was born on the Reshimot of Gimel de Hitlabshut–Bet de Aviut . Neither Galgalta nor AB , which work with selfish desires to receive, can descend below the Tabur , as they know that much stronger desires exist the re. Below the Tabur the Nekudot de SAG fill Galgalta with the Light of Hassadim , i.e. with the pleasures of giving. These pleasures can then be diffused without restra int to any desire in the Partzuf . Below the Tabur, the Nekudot de SAG form a new Partzuf which contains its own 10 Sefir ot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Mal chut. This Partzuf bears the name of “ Nekudot de SAG .” It is of paramount importance in the whole proce ss of correction, as being a part of Bina , which elevates the uncorrected desires to its lev el, corrects and raises above her. From the top to the Tabur , Galgalta comprises: (i) At the Head level: the Sefirot Keter , Hochma and Bina . (ii) At the Toch level: Hesed , Gevura and Tifferet . (iii) Below the Tabur , in the Sof : Netzah , Hod , Yesod and Malchut . When the Nekudot de SAG descend below the Tabur and begin to transmit the Light of Hassadim to the Sof of Galgalta , they are subjected to a strong reaction on the pa rt of the Reshimot remaining in the Sof of Galgalta from the Light that previously filled these Kelim . These Reshimot are of strength Dalet-Gimel . The strength of the Dalet - Gimel ( Hitlabshut of Level 4, Aviut of Level 3) is higher than the strength of the Masach of the Nekudot de SAG ( Hitlabshut of Level 2 , Aviut of Level 2). Therefore SAG cannot oppose such a powerful Light-Desire and beg ins to desire to receive it for itself. We can now examine the Bina phase in the spreading of the Straight Light from above downward (See Figure 1). This phase is composed of two parts: (i) In the first it does not want to receive anythi ng, while giving without restraint. This part is ca lled Gar de Bina and is endowed with altruistic attributes. (ii) The second part already considers receiving th e Light, though in order to transmit it further on. Although it is receiving, it does not do it for its own sake. This part of Bina is called Zat de Bina ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Figure 6. Partzuf of Nekudot de SAG The same thing occurs in the Partzuf of the Nekudot de SAG, which possesses the attributes of Bina : The first six Sefirot bear the name of Gar de Bina and the last four Sefirot are named Zat de Bina . The powerful Light of Hochma that reaches Gar de Bina does not affect it; it is indifferent to this Ligh t. However, Zat de Bina , which desires to receive in order to give to the lower levels, may receive only that Light which relates to Aviut Bet. If the desires reaching Zat de Bina are of a stronger Aviut , the desire to receive for oneself alone appears. However, after the Tzimtzum Alef (First Restriction), Malchut cannot receive with a self-aimed intention. Therefore, as soon as such a desire appears in the Zat of the Nekudot de SAG , Malchut rises and positions itself on the border between altruistic and selfish desires t hat is in the middle of Tifferet . This act of Malchut is called Tzimtzum Bet , the second restriction. A new border for the spre ading of the Light is being formed along this line: the Parsa . This border was located before in the Sium of Galgalta . While the Light was previously able to spread only up to the Tabur , even though it tried to penetrate under it, with the spreading of the Partzuf of the Nekudot de SAG below the Tabur , the Light of Hassadim did penetrate there, and paved the way so to speak for the spreading of the Light of Hochma to the Parsa . However, if before the Tzimtzum Bet the Ohr Hassadim could spread below the Tabur , afterward there would remain absolutely no Light below the Parsa . The Partzuf of the Nekudot de SAG has created the concept of “place” ( Makom ) below the Tabur . What is a “place”? It is a Sefira inside of which another Sefira , smaller in dimension, can be fitted. Our world exists in a “place.” If one removes from the universe absolutely everything it contains, the n the “place” will remain. Man’s finite mind cannot perceive it, but it can on ly be said that this is simply a void that cannot b e measured since it is located in other dimensions. In addition to our world there exist spiritual worl ds that are impossible to perceive or feel because they refer to other dimensions."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Afterward, the World of Atzilut appears at the place of Gar de Bina below the Tabur . The World of Beria is formed under the Parsa in the lower section of Tifferet . The World of Yetzira appears at the place of the Sefirot Netzah , Hod , Yesod . The World of Assiya whose last portion is called our world, is formed at the place of the Sefira Malchut . How can 10 Sefirot be obtained out of 5: Keter , Hochma , Bina , Zeir Anpin and Malchut ? Each of these Sefirot , with the exception of Zeir Anpin , is made up of 10 Sefirot . Zeir Anpin , being a small entity, comprises six Sefirot only: Hesed , Gevura , Tifferet , Netzah , Hod , Yesod . If instead of Zeir Anpin , one places its six Sefirot , then along with Keter , Hochma , Bina and Malchut , 10 Sefirot will be obtained. This is the reason why sometimes 5 or 10 Sefirot are mentioned. There is on the other hand, no such thing as a Partzuf with 12 or 9 Sefirot . Lesson 5 Topics examined in this lesson: 35.

The Shattering of Desires 42. World of Atzilut We shall commence with a brief review: the Creation is brought forth by the Light emanating from the C reator, and this Light is the desire to give delight, and is ca lled Behina Shoresh (Root Phase). It builds for itself the desire to receive delight, Behina Alef , which after being filled with the Light, adopts the attribute of the Light; that is the desire to give, to relentlessly bring delight. This corresponds to Behina Bet . But there is nothing it has to give. It realizes th at it can bring Him delight only if it accepts a po rtion of the Light for His sake. So the third stage: Zeir Anpin is created. It already has two properties: to give and to receive. After perceiving these two kinds of delight, Zeir Anpin feels that receiving is better and nicer than givi ng. This is its initial character in stage Alef . Therefore it decides to receive all the Light and i s completely filled with the Light, but now upon it s own wish. Its delight is infinite. This has become the fourth phase, called Malchut of the World of Ein Sof , the one and only true Creation. It combines the two conditions: it knows in advance wh at it wishes, and out of the two states it chooses receiving. The first three phases do not bear the name of “Cre ation” because they do not possess a desire of thei r own, but only the Creator’s or a consequence of it. The fourth stage, after being filled with Light jus t as during the first phase, starts adopting the at tributes of the Creator, and senses itself as a receiver. A feeling of shame arises leading to the decision t o become like the Creator, i.e. not to allow any Li ght in and the Tzimtzum Alef (First Restriction ) takes place. How is it that the Tzimtzum did not take place in the end of Phase 1? The answ er is that during the first phase, the desire of the Kli was not its own, but was the wish of the Creator. Here the creation restricts its own desire to recei ve, and does not use it. Tzimtzum is made not on the desire to receive delight, but on the aspiration to receive for itself. It refers only to intention. In the first case the Kli simply ceased to receive. Now, if the Kli made a decision to receive, but not for its own sa ke, it could fill itself with a certain portion of the Light, depending on the strength of its intention t o counteract the force of egoism. This reception of Light for the benefit of another is equal to bestowal. An action in the spiritual wo rld is defined by its intention, not by the action itself. The First Restriction means that the Kli will never use delight for its own sake. Tzimtzum Alef will never be violated. That is why the primary task of a created being is the necessity to neutralize the wish to receive del ight for its own sake."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The first created being, Behina Dalet , shows how to receive pleasure from all the Light of the Creator, although the First Restriction means that all that Malchut is filled up with will never be received as deligh t for its own sake. We shall see how this principle can be further impl emented. Initially, Malchut places a Screen above its egoism, which pushes awa y all the incoming Light. This is a kind of test to check whether Malchut is able to resist all the enormous delight which p resses against the Screen and which corresponds to an equally enormous desire to receiv e it. Yes, it does succeed in pushing away all the deligh t, and does not luxuriate in it. But in this case the Kli is separated from the Light. How to achieve a situ ation, when the delight is not simply pushed away, but some portion of it is received for the sake of the Creator? For this to take place, the Light reflected by the Screen ( Ohr Hozer ) must somehow clothe the Straight Light ( Ohr Yashar ), and together they will enter the Kli , that is, the desire to receive. Thus Ohr Hozer serves as the anti-egoistic condition, accepting a nd allowing in the Ohr Yashar , the delight. Here Ohr Hozer acts as an altruistic intention. Before taking in these two kinds of Lights, a calculation is carried out in the Rosh . How much Light may be received for the Creator’s sake? This quantity passes in the Toch . The first Partzuf may receive, for example, twenty percent of the Li ght, according to the power of its Screen. This Light is called Inner Light – Ohr Pnimi . The portion of Light which did not enter the Kli , remains outside and is therefore called the Surro unding Light, Ohr Makif . The initial receiving of twenty percent of the Ligh t is called Partzuf Galgalta. Following the pressure of the two Lights, Ohr Makif and Ohr Pnimi on the Screen in the Tabur , the Partzuf expels all the Light. The Screen then moves gradually up f rom Tabur to Peh , losing its anti-egoistic power and reaching the level of the Screen in the Peh de Rosh . Note that nothing disappears in the spiritual world , each consecutive action encompasses the previous one. Thus, the twenty percent of Light received from Peh to Tabur remains in the previous state of the Partzuf . Afterwards, the Partzuf , seeing that it is not able to manage the 20% of L ight, makes a decision to take the Light in again, this time not 20%, but 15%. For this purpose, it has to lower its Screen from t he level of Peh to the level of Hazeh of the Partzuf Galgalta , that is, to move down to a lower spiritual level. If at the beginning its level was defined by the Reshimot : Hitlabshut of Level 4 and Aviut of Level 4, now it is only 4 and 3 respectively. The Light enters the same way and forms a new Partzuf : AB . The destiny of the new Partzuf is the same; it also pushes the Light away. Following on this occurrence, the third Partzuf , SAG, spreads out, and after it, MA and BON . All five Partzufim fill Galgalta from its Peh to Tabur . The world which they form is called Adam Kadmon . Galgalta is similar to the Behina Shoresh , since while receiving from the Creator it gives w hatever it can. AB receives a smaller portion for the sake of the Cre ator, and is called Hochma , as Behina Alef . SAG works only for bestowal and is called Bina , as Behina Bet . MA is similar to Zeir Anpin , as Behina Gimel , and BON corresponds to Malchut , Behina Dalet . SAG, having the properties of Bina, is able to spread under the Tabur and fill the lower part of Galgalta with the Light. Below the Tabur , with the exception of empty desires, remain the d elights induced by similarity with the Creator. All this because the NHY ( Sefirot : Netzah Hod Yesod ) of Galgalta below the Tabur refused to take in the Light of Hochma . They enjoy the Light of Hassadim , the delight of similarity with the Creator. This delight is also on the level Dalet de Aviut . The Nekudot de SAG have Aviut Bet , and may enjoy from bestowal of the Light on this level only. Hence they cannot longer resist the delight of the level Dalet , otherwise they will begin to receive the Light fo r their own sake. The above should normally occur, but Malchut standing in the Sium of Galgalta rises to the middle of Tifferet of Partzuf Nekudot de SAG and forms a new Sium (Conclusion). This is the restriction of the Light , called Parsa , below which the Light cannot go. With this action Malchut makes the second restriction on the spreading of t he Light, called Tzimtzum Bet by analogy with the first one. To take an example from our everyday life: imagine a man with pleasant manners and good upbringing who would never steal up to the sum of $1000. However, if $10 ,000 were laid before him, his education might not “work” because in this case, the temptation, the prospecti ve delight, is too powerful to be resisted. Tzimtzum Bet is the continuation of Tzimtzum Alef , but on the Vessels of receiving, the Kelim de Kabbalah ."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"It is interesting to note that in the Nekudot de SAG , the Partzuf, which is altruistic by nature, has disclosed its s elfish properties; immediately Malchut , ascending upward, covers it and forms a line, cal led Parsa , to limit the downward spreading of the Light. The Rosh of the Partzuf SAG , as every Head, consists of five Sefirot : Keter , Hochma , Bina , Zeir Anpin and Malchut . These in turn, are divided into the Kelim de Ashpa’a ( Keter , Hochma and half of Bina ) and Kelim de Kabbalah (from the middle of Bina to Malchut ). Kelim de Ashpa’a (Vessels of bestowal) are also called Galgalta ve Eynaim . The Kelim de Kabbalah are the Awzen, Hotem, Peh: AH P . The restriction of Tzimtzum Bet means that from this point on a Partzuf must not activate any of the Vessels of receiving. It is prohibited to use AHP ; so decided Malchut , when it rose to the middle of Tifferet . After Tzimtzum Bet all the Reshimot move up to the Rosh of SAG , there requesting to form a Partzuf of the level of Galgalta ve Eynaim exclusively. This allows the Partzuf to receive some Light from contact with the Creato r. It now means that the Screen must be located not in Peh de Rosh , but in Nikveh Eynaim , which corresponds to the line of Parsa in the middle of Tifferet in Guf . After a Zivug in Rosh of SAG , a Partzuf will emerge from this point and will spread below the Tabur and down to the Parsa . The new Partzuf , which spreads below the Tabur to Parsa , clothes the previous Partzuf of Nekudot de SAG , but on its upper part only, meaning on altruistic Kelim . The name of the new Partzuf is Katnut of Olam Nikudim (Smallness of the World of Nikudim ). This Partzuf appears on the level of the restricted Reshimot of Bet-Alef . In fact, of the five worlds previously mentioned ( Adam Kadmon , Atzilut , Beria , Yetzira and Assiya ) there does not exist such a world, because as soon as it was born, it broke apart immediately. During the brief existence of this world, the Sefirot of Keter , Hochma , Bina , Hesed , Gevura and the one third of Tifferet are divided into ten and have the usual names. In addition, there are special names for the Sefirot of Hochma and Bina : Abba ve Ima (Father and Mother) and also, the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin and Malchut : ZON , Zeir Anpin and Nukva (Female). Following the Zivug de Aka’a in the Nikveh Eynaim in Rosh of SAG , upon the request of the Reshimot of the lower Partzuf , SAG performs a second Zivug on the Reshimot of Gadlut (Greatness) in the Peh de Rosh . As this action takes place, a great Light begins to spread out from SAG and tries to descend below the Parsa . Partzuf Nikudim is absolutely certain that it will be able to rece ive the Light for the sake of the Creator, and that it has enough power for this, notwithstanding the Tzimtzum Bet . However, at the moment the Light touches the Parsa, the Shevirat haKelim (shattering of the Vessels ) occurs, because it becomes clear that the Partzuf wants to receive delight for itself only. Light immediately exits the Partzuf and all the Kelim, even those which were above the Parsa, are shattered. So from the desire of the Partzuf to use the Kelim de Kabbalah for the Creator’s sake; to form the Wor ld of Nikudim in Gadlut , using all ten Kelim, a shattering of al l its screen-intentions occurred. n the Guf of the Partzuf Nikudim, i.e. in ZON above the Parsa (Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet) and below the Parsa (Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut) there are eight Se firot. Each of these consists of four phases (apart from phase zero). These, in turn, bear ten Sefirot, yielding a total of 320 Kelim (4 x 8 x 10), which have been broken. Of the 320 broken Kelim, only Malchut cannot be cor rected and this represents 32 parts (4 x 8). The remaining 288 parts (320 - 32) can be corrected . The 32 parts are called Lev haEven (lit. Heart of Stone). These will only be corrected by the Creator Himself at th e time of Gmar Tikkun (Final Correction). The altruistic and selfish desires have simultaneou sly broken apart and intermingled. As a result, eve ry element of the broken Kelim consists of 288 parts that are fit for correction and 32 which are not. Now the achievement of the goal of Creation only de pends on the correction of the broken World of Niku dim. If we succeed in our required task, the Behina Dalet will be filled with the Light. Olam haTikkun (World of Correction) is created to b uild a coherent system which will then correct the Kelim of the World of Nikudim. This new world is also called Olam Atzilut (World o f Emanation). Lesson 6 Topics examined in this lesson: 43. 125 Levels"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"44. The Sin of Adam HaRishon 45. The Shattering of the Vessels 46. The Breaking of the Souls 47. The Breaking of the Worlds 48. World of Nikudim 49. World of Correction 50. Partzufim of World of Atzilut 51. The birth of the Worlds of BYA There are five worlds between the Creator and our w orld. Each of them consists of five Partzufim and each Partzuf of five Sefirot . In total there are 125 levels between us and the Cr eator. Malchut, moving through all these levels, reaches the last one, and in this way, Behina Dalet , the only creation, merges with the four previous phases. Malchut fully absorbs the properties of the four phases an d thus becomes equal to the Creator. This is the Go al of Creation. In order to mix Malchut with the remaining nine Sefirot , a special Partzuf is created. This consists of Malchut and the nine Sefirot from Keter to Yesod . Its name is Adam . In the beginning, the nine Sefirot and the tenth, Malchut , are not connected to each other in any way. That’ s why it was said that in the beginning Adam was forbidden t o eat the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Goo d and Evil. With the fall of Adam and the shattering of his Kelim , the four upper phases, or the nine first Sefirot , fall into Malchut . Here the fourth stage can choose to remain the sa me old Malchut or to prefer spiritual development in the similarity of the four phases. If Malchut remains like its own self, this means that Malchut , or the soul, or Adam, is in the World of Assiya , though, if it becomes like the third phase, then Malchut is in the World of Yetzira . The similarity to the second phase means that Malchut is in the World of Beria . Similarity to the first stage corresponds to Malchut in the World of Atzilut . Finally, similarity to the zero phase means exist ence of Malchut in the World of Adam Kadmon . All spiritual movements from above downward, from Malchut of the Ein Sof to our world, and back to the World of Ein Sof , are preordained. Nothing is planned that is not in accordance with t he goal of Creation. This goal is achieved when the fourth stage becomes similar to the third, second, first and zer o stages, which are all contained in the fourth sta ge. All the worlds appear as the descent of the Creator from above downward, over the 125 levels of the fi ve worlds. This is like a permanent restriction of the Creator , making the whole of Creation recede from Him unti l Creation reaches the level of our world, which no longer fee ls Him. When Creation rises upward, it makes its way throug h the same 125 levels of the five worlds, which wer e formed for this specific purpose. Advancing a single level provides you with the power to take a leap forward to the next one. The descent from above to below is the regression p rocess of the soul, but the ascent is progression. During the descent, the power of each level lessens , because it conceals more and more of the Light of the Creator from His Creation. But the reverse movement increas ingly reveals to man the Light of the Creator and c onsequently grants him the power to overcome obstacles. Let us explain what happens when Shevirat haKelim takes place. The nine altruistic Sefirot that Malchut , being the selfish part, tries to use for its own sake, fall into Malchut . At this time, altruism and selfishness are blended together . Now, if a strong Light enlightens this blend and aw akens Malchut , making it understand its own nature and what the Creator is, this enables Malchut to strive to be like the upper Sefirot , i.e. the Light of the Creator. Even though Shevirat haKelim is, so to say, an anti-spiritual action, actually it is the only possible process that can enable Malchut to bond with the altruistic properties of the Crea tor and to rise up to His level at a later stage. After Shevirat haKelim , two parallel systems of worlds, Assiya , Yetzira , Beria , Atzilut and Adam Kadmon are built as two systems: altruistic and selfish. These world s are built on the basis of Shevirat haKelim , which is why their system specifically grasps a man’s soul. The soul of man also consists of selfish and altrui stic Kelim . The Fall of Adam combined these two sorts of Kelim and his Partzuf was broken. When ascending to the appropriate level in the syst em of worlds, each such broken part may discover it s respective attribute there. Shevirat Neshamot (the breaking of souls) of Adam and Shevirat Nikudim are built on the same basis. The worlds are a kind of outer casing for the soul."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In our material world, it is the Universe, the Eart h and everything around us, which forms the outer c asing, enclosing mankind within it. When examining how the World of Atzilut is designed, we may note that its structure comple tely matches the World of Nikudim . The Nekudot de SAG , after Tzimtzum Bet , ascend to the Rosh of SAG with three kinds of Reshimot . From the restricted Reshimot of Bet - Alef , the World of Nikudim is formed in the Katnut on Kelim Galgalta ve Eynaim . This spreads downward from the Tabur to Parsa . This Partzuf , like any other, is composed of Rosh and Guf . Its Rosh is divided into three parts: the first Rosh is called Keter , the second Abba ( Hochma ) and the third Ima ( Bina ). The Guf of the World of Nikudim is called ZON - Zeir Anpin and Nukva . Above the Parsa is Gar de ZON , below the Parsa we find Zat de ZON . Following this the World of Nikudim craved to enter the Gadlut , i.e., to join the AHP s to itself. But when the upper Light reached Parsa and tried to cross it, the World of Nikudim broke apart. Rosh Keter and Rosh Abba ve Ima remain, since the Heads do not break. But ZON , i.e., Guf, breaks completely, both above the Parsa , and below it. Now, there are in total 320 broken parts, 32 of which ( Lev haEven ) are not possible to correct by one’s own power. T he remaining 288 parts are subject to correction. Next, in order to correct the broken Kelim , Olam haTikkun (Olam Atzilut) is created. Reshimot from the breakage of all 320 parts ascend to Rosh of SAG . At the beginning, the Rosh of SAG selects the purest parts, the lightest with respec t to the ability to be corrected. This is the law of correction: first the easiest pa rts get corrected and then with their help, the nex t parts are handled. Out of the corrected Kelim , Rosh of SAG creates the Partzufim of the World of Atzilut , similar to a small World of Nikudim : (i) Keter of the World of Atzilut , also named Atik (ii) Hochma , also named Arich Anpin (iii) Bina , also named Abba ve Ima (iv) Zeir Anpin (v) Nukva , also named Malchut The World of Atzilut is a replica of the World of Nikudim . Atik is between the Tabur of Galgalta and Parsa , Arich Anpin from Peh of Atik to Parsa , Abba ve Ima from Peh of Arich Anpin to Tabur of Arich Anpin . Zeir Anpin stands from Tabur of Arich Anpin to Parsa , Malchut is in the form of a point under Zeir Anpin (see Figure 7)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Figure 7. The World of Atzilut and the Worlds of BYA Each Partzuf is composed of two parts: Galgalta ve Eynaim , Kelim of bestowal, and AHP s, Kelim of reception. After being shattered, the Vessel consists not of t wo parts, but of four: Galgalta ve Eynaim , AHP , Galgalta ve Eynaim inside AHP and AHP inside Galgalta ve Eynaim . Such a combination can be found in each of the 320 broken Kelim . The aim is to break each particle and separate Galgalta ve Eynaim from AHP . The process is as follows: the World of Atzilut directs a ray of powerful Light to every non-corre cted part, separating out its Galgalta ve Eynaim , then lifts it and sets aside the AHP , the Kelim . Therefore the AHP s will not be used. After the World of Atzilut corrects all the Galgalta ve Eynaim , Malchut of the World of Atzilut ascends to Bina , i.e., under the Rosh of the World of Atzilut . Rosh of the World of Atzilut are Atik , Arich Anpin , Abba ve Ima . There Malchut performs the following actions: (i) Zivug on Bet de Aviut (level 2), creating the World of Beria . (ii) Zivug on Alef de Aviut (level 1), creating the World of Yetzira . (iii) Zivug in Aviut Shoresh (level 0), giving birth to the World of Assiya . The ascent of Bina moves the World of Atzilut two levels up: Malchut is now in the place of Abba ve Ima , Zeir Anpin in the place of Arich Anpin , and Arich Anpin and Atik ascend in proportion. Partzuf Malchut of the World of Atzilut , which is in this ascent equivalent to Bina , Abba ve Ima , can create, “give birth.”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The result is that the World of Beria is born out of Malchut of Atzilut and occupies a new place instead of Zeir Anpin of the World of Atzilut , under the Rosh , that has given birth to it. The newborn is usuall y one level below its mother. After this, the World of Yetzira is brought to life. Its first four Sefirot , i.e. its upper part, now occupies the place of Malchut of the World of Atzilut . Though in its lower part, six lower Sefirot , are located, correspondingly, in the position of the first six Sefirot , the place of the World of Beria . The next world, Assiya , covers half of the World of Beria and half of the World of Yetzira . The four Sefirot of the World of Yetzira and ten Sefirot of the World of Assiya remain empty. This empty place is called Mador Klipot , the place of evil forces. In order to emphasize its importance we can conside r the whole process once more: The World of Nikudim went out in Katnut with Rosh being Keter , Rosh being Abba ve Ima , ZON being its Guf . All this is called Galgalta ve Eynaim and spreads from Tabur to Parsa . After this the Gadlut of the World of Nikudim begins to emerge, which has ten Sefirot both in Rosh and Guf . Gadlut appeared in Keter , in Abba ve Ima , but when ZON wants to receive Gadlut the World of Nikudim breaks apart. All the Kelim of Guf break into 320 parts, they fall under Parsa and combine with each other, yielding four groups: (i) Galgalta ve Eynaim (ii) AHP (iii) Galgalta ve Eynaim in AHP (iv) AHP in Galgalta ve Eynaim To correct the broken Kelim , the World of Atzilut is created. Firstly, its three Partzufim are born: Atik , Arich Anpin , Abba ve Ima , which fully correspond to the Partzufim : Keter and Abba ve Ima in the World of Nikudim . Zeir Anpin and Malchut correspond to the same Partzufim in the World of Nikudim . At this stage, the correction of the extracted Kelim Galgalta ve Eynaim from all the 320 parts is finished. Further, we have Galgalta ve Eynaim inside the AHP s. There is no way to extract it, but the directed ray of Light may bring it closer to the Light. Atzilut wants to do the correction in AHP . Malchut ascends to Bina and gives birth to the ten Sefirot of the World of Beria , which stands in place of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut because Malchut of the World of Atzilut is now in Abba ve Ima . At this stage the ten Sefirot of the World of Yetzira are brought about; the last one partially overlaps the World of Beria . The part of the World of Yetzira is under Parsa in the place of the upper half of the World of Beria . Finally, the World of Assiya is located from the middle part of the place of th e World of Beria to the middle part of the place of the World of Yetzira . Beginning in the middle of the place of the World o f Yetzira and finally ending in the place of the World of Assiya is emptiness, Mador Klipot . Presently we will see that the worlds can ascend an d descend, but always moving together with respect to their initial position. All that has been discussed in the present chapter is described in the 1500 pages of the Talmud Esser HaSefirot (Study of the 10 Sefirot ) by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. This work of major import ance provides guidelines for our spiritual progression and helps us to keep focused on the correct goal. Our correction pertains to the Second Restriction, Tzimtzum Bet . As a result we cannot see beyond Tzimtzum Alef , the First Restriction. Actually, there is no human way to even imagine what sort of forces operate the re, nor the nature of reality that exists in this place. These are referred to as the secrets of the Kabbalah.

The Birth of Adam HaRishon 57. Connecting with the Creator The first Partzuf of the World of Atzilut, Atik, co mes out on the Reshimot of Alef-Shoresh (Hitlabshut of Level 1, Aviut of Level 0) in the Katnut at first, from Tabu r to Parsa. Then it spreads in the Gadlut all the w ay to our world on the Reshimot of Dalet-Gimel (4,3)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"It is the only a Partzuf by means of which the Light can shine in our world . We do not see or feel this Light, but it shines and drives us forward. Whoever ascends from our world to below Parsa , where the worlds Beria , Yetzira and Assiya are located, is called a righteous man, a tzadik . It should be noted that the Partzuf Atik spreads not only to the Parsa , in order to pass on Light to other Partzufim of the World of Atzilut , but below the Parsa as well. Since Atik is in Tzimtzum Alef , this Partzuf is able to spread everywhere, and when it is below the Parsa it lights up the souls of the righteous who want to ascend to th e World of Atzilut . Being in the Worlds of BYA means “giving for the sake of bestowal,” while bein g in the World of Atzilut means “receiving for the sake of bestowal.” The next Partzuf , Arich Anpin , Hochma , comes out in Katnut . After this Partzuf , Abba ve Ima ( Bina ) is born, then Partzuf Zeir Anpin , and finally Malchut is born in the form of a point. The AHP s of the five Partzufim of the World of Atzilut are the Kelim de Kabbalah , Vessels for receiving. They are to be restored and corrected. The World of Atzilut is the only world we study. All the others we stud y inasmuch as they are related to the World of Atzilut . The aim is to ultimately raise all the souls to Atzilut . Partzuf Arich Anpin wraps itself up with many different coverings, which are called Seairot , hair, similar to the hair of the human body. The Light is passed onto all the lower worlds throu gh the Seairot. If the souls in the lower worlds de sire the Light of Hochma , they apply to Arich Anpin and receive this Light through its “13 kinds of me rcy” - 13 parts of the Partzuf Seairot. If this Partzuf contracts, the flowing of the Light ceases, and th rough this occurrence all the worlds suffer. All ki nds of exiles stem from this. But if Arich Anpin allows the Light to pass through it, such a period is considered very beneficial. In order to receive the Light of Hochma from Arich Anpin , it is necessary to rise in its Rosh . When Malchut of the World of Atzilut ascends to the level of Arich Anpin , it indicates that Malchut improves its properties to such an extent that it becomes simila r to Arich Anpin . This process unfolds as follows: first a request fr om Malchut is sent to Abba ve Ima , which performs a correction on Malchut , and then Malchut ascends to the Rosh of Arich Anpin . There can only be the Light of Hassadim in the next Partzuf , Abba ve Ima . Malchut and Zeir Anpin are being corrected with the help of this Light, and further they are able to receive the Light of Hochma from the Rosh of Arich Anpin . Abba ve Ima creates additional Partzufim , which enter Zeir Anpin and Malchut , in order to show by example how to carry out different actions. Such an additional Partzuf , which gives power and knowledge to Zeir Anpin and Malchut , is called Tzelem (image or semblance). Everything that corrects relates to Abba ve Ima . Everything that is corrected relates to Malchut and Zeir Anpin . Why are only these two Partzufim to be corrected? Because these two Partzufim were broken in the World of Nikudim . The first three Partzufim of the World of Atzilut came out on the Reshimot of Rosh (Heads) of the World of Nikudim . Zeir Anpin of the World of Atzilut is called “Ha Kadosh Baruch Hu” (The Holy One Bles sed Be He). Malchut of the World of Atzilut is called Shechina - the aggregation of all the souls. All the names, including the names of personages me ntioned in the Torah, spring from the World of Atzilut . Those personages, furthermore, who are in the Worlds of BYA , all the same, are under the control of the World of Atzilut . The World of Atzilut does not let through any Light below the Parsa apart from a tiny ray of Light, Ohr Tolada . This is done in order to avoid Shevirat haKelim (the shattering of the Vessels) again, as had happ ened in the World of Nikudim . How are the AHP s, located below the Parsa , corrected? They are illuminated with a powerful L ight by which they see how they differ from the Creator. They then wish to improve themselves and apply to t he Partzuf located above, which is the Creator for them. They ask for the feature of bestowal, or in other words a Masach (Screen). If the request coming from AHP i s authentic, the Partzuf located above lifts it out of the World s of BYA and into the World of Atzilut. The filling with Light only takes place in the Worl d of Atzilut . AHP s in the Worlds of BYA are actually seven Sefirot of Zeir Anpin and nine lower Sefirot of Malchut of the World of Atzilut ; it is so because Galgalta ve Eynaim of Zeir Anpin and the Sefira of Keter of Malchut are in the World of Atzilut . The request for help ascends to AHP s of Zeir Anpin and Malchut , located in the Worlds of BYA."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"If these Sefirot can be lifted and attached to the corresponding Sefirot of the World of Atzilut , then it will be possible to fill them with Light. Such a condition is called Gmar Tikkun (Final Correction). What is the difference between the ascending AHP s from those which are reached by the Light coming below the Parsa ? The difference is qualitative: when AHP goes up, it is used as a Vessel for bestowal, not for receiving. Its main feature of receiving is removed during the asc ension. It is thus used as Galgalta ve Eynaim . This adds something to the World of Atzilut , but does not correct the AHP fundamentally. While ascending, AHP does not use its own Light but the Light of Galgalta ve Eynaim . In addition to AHP s that can be raised to the World of Atzilut , there are many Kelim left in BYA that cannot be raised. This is because they are not combined with Galgalta ve Eynaim . What is to be done in order to correct these Kelim ? Just like the Shevirat haKelim in the worlds, a Shevirat haKelim in the souls is produced. For this purpose Malchut of the Ein Sof - which is nothing more than a purely selfish crea ted being, devoid of altruism and in a state of restriction that it acce pted on itself - is added to the Kelim of Galgalta ve Eynaim of the ZON of the World of Atzilut . Here there will be such a combination of Kelim de Kabbalah with Kelim de Ashpa’a , that naturally, such a Partzuf will break into smaller particles. Further, the separate sparks of altruism and selfis hness will combine, paving the way for the correcti on of Malchut by means of these same particles. And so, after the World of Atzilut enters the state of Katnut , Malchut of the World of Atzilut ascends to the level of Ima ( Bina ) of the World of Atzilut and there gives birth to the World of Beria , by making a Zivug on the Aviut Bet . After the second Zivug of Malchut on the Aviut Gimel , the World of Yetzira is born. Then the World of Assiya is brought about after the third Zivug of Malchut on the Aviut Dalet . After all this, a fundamentally new Partzuf is being created in Katnut with Galgalta Eynaim. The AHP of this new Partzuf in the future Gadlut will be Malchut of the Ein Sof itself. This Partzuf is called Adam HaRishon (First Man). But why were these additional Worlds of BYA created? This is to build the necessary environment for this Partzuf , wherein it would exist and receive from all aroun d the required Light, to match its ever changing desires. As in the World of Nikudim , Partzuf of Adam HaRishon is born in Katnut with Kelim Galgalta ve Eynaim . Similar to all Partzufim, it wishes to enter to Gadlut . But the moment it starts to receive Light for Gadlut , in the Kelim de Kabbalah ( AHP ) of Malchut of the Ein Sof , it breaks up into small particles. When Adam was born, he was absolutely righteous (a tzadik ), he was already circumcised, and devoid of Kelim de Kabbalah . Then, as he developed, he wanted to correct the who le Garden of Eden, i.e. all his desires. This, in spite of strict instructions from the Crea tor, not to do Zivug on Malchut of Malchut , which is not able to absorb altruistic intentions, any Kelim de Ashpa’a that will fall into it. Adam had no qualms about his capacity to perform a correction on Malchut of the Ein Sof, because it was his AHP . But the moment Light began to descend from the Worl d of Atzilut below the Parsa , Adam HaRishon was shattered into a great number of parts (600,000). Each of these parts has to spend 6,000 years strivi ng to accomplish its individual correction. The par t of selfishness that a man may sacrifice to the Creator is called t he soul. In the instant of breaking up, all the desires of A dam fell down to the lowest level of selfishness. A t this point all the fragments are separated, and each separate particle strives to draw pleasure and delight from this wor ld. This explains why special conditions were establish ed to help man strengthen his bonding with the Crea tor and to receive the correcting Light from above. While undergoing correction, a man sends a request to the Creator, for assistance to correct all his d esires. The Light of the Creator comes down, and this man must underg o 6,000 consecutive actions to correct his soul. When this happens, the soul becomes similar in its attributes to Malchut of the Ein Sof . It then receives all the Light for the sake of the Creator. Everything we discover relates to the World of Atzilut and to the Partzuf of Adam HaRishon . All that is written in the Kabbalah concerns some p art of this Partzuf , or the world in which it comes out. The perception of the surrounding world at any give n time depends on how high a level man has risen to , and which part of the Partzuf of Adam HaRishon . In order to bond with the spiritual world, a man ha s to achieve a similarity of attributes with this w orld. If even only one desire matches the spiritual attri bute of giving relentlessly, then at this stage, a connection with the Creator is established."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"It is quite difficult to establish this first conta ct. When a man opens up to the spiritual he clearly comprehends it and cannot mistake it. He then needs to transform his d esires. The Creator, for His part, wants man to ach ieve correction and expects man’s request. The divine Light exists in an absolute stillness, o nly the souls are transformed. At every stage of th e transformation they receive new information from the Light. The Creator only replies to sincere prayer-desire. If there is no answer, it means that this is not ye t a true desire to be answered. When man is ready, the answer comes immediately, be cause the Light always wants to fill the Kli . Lesson 8 Topics examined in this lesson: 58. Spirituality vs. Corporeality 59. Vessel Correction 60. The Revelation of the Desire To Receive 61. The Ari Method Arranged by Baal HaSulam 62. The Creation in the Eyes of the Kabbalist All sacred scriptures describe the feelings that a man is expected to live out. The message is always the same: that we are to prefer spirituality to the lures of the m aterial world, and to praise the Creator. The Creator does not stand in need of our praises, because He is totally devoid of egoism. The only thing He wishes is to fill each one of us with delight. This is proportionate to our desire t o choose Him amongst all other things, and to our aspirations to achieve attributes similar to His. The glorification of the Creator is an indication o f the correct orientation of the Kli . The delights from bonding with the Creator can become infinite, eternal, perfect a nd are only restricted by the intervening of a pers on’s egoism. Altruism is a specific attribute, a means of correc ting the Kli . Egoism does not bring any good, worthwhile thing. It is plain to see: the more people have, the more lik ely they are not to be satisfied. The most develope d countries often have an alarming rate of suicides amongst young and old. One may give everything to a person; this often res ults in a lack of feeling for the simple tastes of life. Taste is sensed only when suffering and pleasure co me into contact. The fulfillment of a pleasure lead s to the quenching of the desire to receive it. The Creator’s commandment to change the egoistic na ture of the Kli into an altruistic one, is given for our benefit, not for His own sake. The present condition of man is called Olam Azeh (This World), but its next condition is Olam Haba (World to Come). A world is what one feels at a present momen t, the next, elevated perceived feeling leads to th e perception of a new world. Each student, even if he attended a short course in Kabbalah and then walked away, would still receive something that would keep on living inside him. Each one of us feels unconsciously what the most im portant thing in life is. People are all different. Some were born smarter an d are quicker. Such people often gain success in bu siness and in society. They become wealthy and begin to exploit o thers. Some people are born lazy, they grow and develop sl owly, they are not very lucky. Some might even work harder than the smart ones, but get little in return. We are not able to assess in this world the efforts of a person, as they depend on a great number of i nner qualities that men are born with. There are no devices that could measure the inner, moral efforts of a man, nor the physical ones. The Baal HaSulam, Rabbi Y. Ashlag, writes that appr oximately ten percent of people in this world are s o-called altruists. These are people who receive delight fro m giving. Just as an egoist may kill for not receiving, such an “altruist” may kill for not being able to give. Giving is just a means of receiving delight for him. Such people are, in a way, egoists as well, because their intention is to receive something as a resul t of their bestowal. Naturally they also have to undergo correction. Wit h regards to the spiritual they are all the same. T hey have to go a long way in order to grasp the inherent evil in the ir not being genuine altruists. This is the period in which they realize they are egoists."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The “coarser,” the more egoistic a man is, the clos er he is to seizing the opportunity to move on to s pirituality. His egoism is as mature, as it is enormous. Now, one further step is required, to realize that this egoism is evil to man himself. He must then pl ead with the Creator to change his intention from “receiving for one’s sake” to “receiving for the sake of the Crea tor.” The attribute of shame appears in Malchut of the Ein Sof , when it realizes what Keter , Behina Shoresh is like. It is the sensation of the sharp contrast existing betwee n the Light and itself. Malchut itself does not perceive the Light, only the attri butes and properties which are awakened in it by th e Light. Light itself does not possess any attributes. Those attributes that Malchut feels are the result of the influence that the Light has upon it. All the reactions of the human organism are useful and necessary, whether we speak about the spiritual or material organism. It is considered that all diseases are the reaction of the organism in order to maintain a state of ba lance. Assume that a man has a fever. His organism produce s a high temperature to kill germs, to protect itse lf. This reaction is always perceived not as an unhealthy co ndition of the organism, but as an outer manifestat ion, a reaction to an inner process. That is why it is wrong to kill the symptoms of the diseases, i.e. to neutralize the reaction of the o rganism. Our egoism is very clever. If there are any desires impossible to satisfy, it suppresses them in order not to bring needless suffering. However, the moment certain conditions arise, these desires resurface. The above is true for even a weak, ill or old perso n, who does not have any special desires except one : to remain alive. The organism suppresses the desires that are not to be fulfilled. The evolution of the world is divided into the four stages of Ohr Yashar , when Behina Alef turned to Bet , Bet to Gimel and so on. But when Malchut of the Ein Sof was formed, it absorbed all the desires of the upp er Sefirot , which live in Malchut and do not change in any way. The fact that other worlds were formed later on doe s not bear witness to changing desires, but to evol ving intentions. Depending on the intention, different desires are a ctivated. But the desires themselves do not change. Nothing new that was not there previously is created. It is the same with the thoughts that came to us to day, but not yesterday. They were there before, but yesterday they were concealed from us. Everything is in a latent state inside of man, and there is a time for the unfolding of each action. N othing new is created. It is impossible to transform two different things into one another. For example to change inorganic n ature into organic, or beings of the vegetative kingdom into m embers of the animal one, etc. The intermediate classes do exist, for example, hal fway between the vegetative and animal worlds, i.e. the corals of the sea. Between vegetative and animal we may find a living organism feeding on the soil. The ape is located halfway between the animal and h uman realm of existence. It cannot be a complete an imal, but neither will it ever be a human being. The only transformation that may occur is when a di vine spark draws man to the spiritual and fosters t he desire to attain, to reach for something higher. At this stage then, this two-legged creature become s a true man. There are only very few men that may be called “man” from the Kabbalistic point of view. The development of science and technology is bound to reach an eventual deadlock and make us come to t he conclusion that that is not the main goal. But firs t of all this state of deadlock needs to be reached . Kabbalists have always organized groups of students . Under no circumstances are the students to be ran ked or distinguished according to their desire to study. Man is created with certain desires beforehand, and nobody knows why he is created that way and why hi s desires are displayed in a particular way. Ranking and selection in a group takes place natura lly before a permanent group is constituted. Nobody, except for Haim Vital, understood the Ari p roperly. The Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria, lived in the m id 16 th century and taught in Safed. It is known that Haim Vital undertook to study by f ollowing the new method worked out by the Ari. Ther e were already great Kabbalists in the group of the Ari, b ut he nevertheless transmitted everything to Haim V ital exclusively. The way a master in Kabbalah teaches depends on the type of souls which descend to this world."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Prior to the Ari, there were other systems of teach ing, other methods. Following the disclosure of the Ari’s methods, it is possible for everybody to study; only a genui ne desire is required. The Baal HaSulam, Rabbi Y. Ashlag, did not modify t he system of the Ari, he only extended it. He gave more detailed commentaries on the books of the Ari and t he Zohar. It is in this way that those in our generation who want to study Kabbalah and draw themselves closer t o the spiritual realm may understand the inner essence of the studi ed material, and may establish analogies when readi ng the Bible (The Five Books of Moses, the Prophets and the Scri ptures). The souls that entered this world prior to the Ari perceived the spiritual as purely extrinsic. After the Ari’s death, souls began to descend, and they studied and analyz ed themselves and the spiritual world by means of a spiritual and scientific method. This is the reason why the books issued before the Ari, are written in a narration format. The books subsequent to the Ari’s teaching, e.g. th e Study of the Ten Sefirot , are written using the language of Behinot (Phases), the Sefirot and the Olamot (Worlds). It is a psychological engineering, a sci entific approach to the soul. For a great Kabbalist there is no reason to be enga ged in the sciences of our world, to carry out diff erent experiments and discoveries. He may provide all the explanations from the point of view of the Kabbalah, because it is the source o f all sciences. Each science possesses its own language. If the Kab balist is not a scientist he will not be able to de scribe different phenomena using the required scientific terminology . The Kabbalist perceives the true laws of the Univer se, which are the foundation of the material and sp iritual essence of all things. In what language might he write the correlation bet ween two objects? And what are the relations betwee n spiritual objects? How can he describe the spiritual force wh ich holds this entire world together? No specific formula in this world can convey all th is. In the spiritual world, the Kabbalist may be ab le to pass on all his perceptions, though how can these perceptions b e made available to the layman? Even if it were possible to somehow narrate, nothin g could be applied to our world until man changes h is egoistic nature. If people could modify their attributes to a higher level, they would be able to communicate amongst t hemselves in a spiritual language and perform spiritual deeds. Each person receives and suffers according to the l evel on which he stands. To rise to a spiritual lev el, a Screen ( Masach ) is required and this is no easy task. Man, as it were, is trapped inside a vicious circle from which he cannot escape. He thus ignores what is beyond it. This is why Kabbalah is called a secret science for those who do not know about its workings. In his Introduction to the Book of the Zohar the Ka bbalist Baal HaSulam talks about the four degrees o f knowledge: (i) substance, (ii) form clothed in substance, (iii ) abstract form and (iv) essence. Science may only study substance and substance with a form. Form without substance is a purely abstrac t conception and does not lend itself to accurate ana lysis. The last, essence, which is what animates ob jects and triggers reactions, is unknowable. The same applies to the spiritual world. Even a gre at Kabbalist may, while studying something spiritua l, perceive substance and its makeup, in whichever form, though never the form without a substance. Thus, in the spiritual dimension, there is also a l imit to our knowledge of the Universe. Finally, when a Kabbalist reaches a certain require d level, he receives a present from Above, and the secrets of the Universe are disclosed to him. Lesson 9 Topics examined in this lesson: 63.

Final Correction The birth of the five worlds:"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"(i) Adam Kadmon (ii) Atzilut (iii) Beria (iv) Yetzira (v) Assiya is actually the realization of the five Sefirot : Keter , Hochma , Bina, Zeir Anpin , and Malchut , which were in Malchut itself. The spreading of the worlds from Above to Below mat ches the progressive increase of the Aviut of the four desires or phases from 0 to 4. The worlds are like a sphere surrounding Malchut . As an analogy, you can picture a man surrounded b y spheres and using his organs of sensation to perceive only the sphere that is closest to him: the World of Assiya . By sharpening his organs of sensation and by modify ing his qualities, man begins gradually to perceive the next sphere, and so on. All the worlds are a sort of filter placed in the L ight’s path, a special Screen that blocks the Surro unding Light: the Ohr Makif . As soon as man senses the presence of these worlds, he removes the “screen-filters.” This draws him cl oser to the Creator. If the Light reached man without being filtered, it would bring about the Shevirat haKelim of man’s Vessels. By removing all “Screen-Worlds” man allows all the worlds to penetrate him. At this stage man acquires the Light and possesses attributes similar to the Light’s. Such a state of being is associated with Gmar Tikkun – the Final Correction. In the beginning, a man is located inside the world s and he perceives their power and the constraints imposed upon him. How can one overcome these constraints? By performi ng an inner correction, corresponding for instance to the attributes of the World of Assiya . This means being an altruist on level zero. After having been overcome, the World of Assiya penetrates man and can be sensed by him. In order to sense the World of Yetzira , it is necessary to acquire attributes similar to those of this world and to allow this world to penetrate us. At this stage we become level one altruists. The go al is to let all the worlds in, and to become simil ar to these worlds according to the following degrees of Aviut : 2, 3, 4. By this means, Malchut is fully corrected and absorbs the first nine Sefirot , while man moves beyond the limits of all the worlds and reaches the World of Infinity ( Olam Ein Sof ). To begin correction man needs to aspire to the attr ibutes of the Creator as well as attain his own. Each new Partzuf of the World of Atzilut starts from the Peh of the previous Partzuf , except the Partzufim of Zeir Anpin and Malchut ; Zeir Anpin starts from the Tabur of Abba ve Ima and Malchut starts from the Tabur of Zeir Anpin . The three Partzufim of Atik , Arich Anpin , and Abba ve Ima are called Keter , Hochma and Bina and this corresponds to Keter , Hochma and Bina of the World of Nikudim . Rosh of the World of Atzilut corresponds to the two Heads of the World of Nikudim and fulfills the same function. Rosh of the World of Atzilut , which consist of Atik , Arich Anpin and Abba ve Ima , was the first to emerge on the Reshimot of the non-broken Kelim of the World of Nikudim . However, Zeir Anpin and Malchut are gradually restored. Only Galgalta ve Eynaim is restored from Zeir Anpin and a single point from Malchut . AHP s of Zeir Anpin and Malchut are in the Worlds of BYA . If these AHP s are corrected, then all worlds are corrected. The correction is carried out with the help of the Partzuf of Adam HaRishon . What is this Partzuf of Adam HaRishon like? Malchut of the World of Atzilut is raised to the level of Bina . This is achieved in three phases. The whole World of Atzilut then ascends three levels. The normal condition of the World of Atzilut is called “a weekday.” During such days the World of Atzilut is illuminated by an incomplete Light which spreads do wn to the Parsa . After this, a greater Light comes down from Above a nd grants higher attributes to the World of Atzilut , making it move up one level. Now Malchut is located in the place of Zeir Anpin . Zeir Anpin now reaches the level of Abba ve Ima . Abba ve Ima replace Arich Anpin , which in turn rises to the level of Atik , which finally rises even higher into SAG . The first elevation of the World of Atzilut takes place on Friday evening, Erev Shabbat ."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Such a progression is called arousal from Above, itaruta de letata , in Aramaic. In our world this corresponds to days, weeks, time and all that is not dependent on us but dependent on the laws of nature and over whi ch we have no control. The next phase elevates the World of Atzilut one level higher. Malchut now stands on the level of Abba ve Ima, where it is endowed with an additional attribute: t he intention to give. At this stage Malchut may receive, for the Creator’s sake. It now has a Screen and is able to perform a Zivug de Aka’a , thus creating new Partzufim . Based on the attributes of Abba ve Ima on the one hand, and on the attributes of the Malchut of the Ein Sof , on the other hand, Malchut creates a new Partzuf : Adam HaRishon . For a Kabbalist, spiritual states, called Erev Shabbat (Friday evening), Shabbat (Saturday), Motzei Shabbat (Saturday evening) may be experienced on days beari ng no connection to the calendar. While on the Shabbat it is prohibited to smoke or to travel in a vehicl e, in the personal Shabbat , everything is allowed. That’s because the Kabbalist lives in this world an d is compelled to do and obey its laws. Thus, for a Kabbalist six days may last a split sec ond, while Shabbat may last several days. These two kinds of things are totally incomparable. Everything that occurs in this world relates to our body, but what takes place in the spiritual world relates to the soul. For the time being, we can witness that our soul an d body are not synchronized. But in the future, when our world will operate with the same principles as the spiritual worlds, which will happen when the Gmar Tikkun is achieved, all the deeds of the two worlds as we ll as all the times will merge together. If you changed and this has taken you one second, a nd your next change takes five years, then this mea ns that your next second will have lasted five years. In the spiritual world time is measured by the tran sformation of one’s attributes. A thousand years ma y elapse in our world before a man begins to study Kabbalah. Upon entering the spiritual, we are able to live in a day what we used to live in several lives. This is an example of transformation and shrinking of time. Spiritual years correspond to the 6,000 degree leve ls of BYA and they cannot be matched with our material time referential. Ascent from the Worlds of BYA to the World of Atzilut is called Saturday, Sabbath or Shabbat . The portion ranging between Tabur of Galgalta and the Parsa is called Shabbat . The first ascent is the ascent of the World of Beria to the World of Atzilut , the second one is the ascent of the World of Yetzira to the World of Atzilut , and the third one relates to the World of Assiya . The ascent of the Worlds of BYA and the World of Atzilut takes place simultaneously. When the third phase of ascent occurs, the World of Atzilut encompasses the Zeir Anpin and the Malchut of Atzilut and the Worlds of BYA . At this time the Rosh of the World of Atzilut : Atik , Arich Anpin , Abba ve Ima , duly cross the boundaries of the World of Atzilut and enter the World of Adam Kadmon . The Rosh of Galgalta ascends in its turn (Phase 1 of the ascent) togeth er with Rosh AB (Phase 2 of the ascent), and with Rosh SAG (Phase 3 of the ascent) and enters the World of Ein Sof . A man who reaches the first spiritual World of Assiya may, during the third phase of ascent, reach the W orld of Atzilut and experience the spiritual Shabbat . This man would then be brought back to his initial state, because his ascent was not the result of his own efforts, but received as a gift from Above. The direction of spiritual time is always from the bottom up. All souls, all of mankind, without being aware of the process, are constantly ascending, getting closer t o the Creator in order to bond with Him. This is called the direct flow of spiritual time. T ime always is measured in the positive direction ev en if man may feel the process as being negative. Man is egoistic, that is why the spiritual is perce ived as negative. However, man never degrades himse lf when he walks the path of spiritual progression. In this world man should not seek to inflate his eg oism, rather he should long to come closer to the C reator instead. While working in this direction until his final cor rection, man will increasingly sense his growing eg oism, i.e. his natural egoism will be worsened compared to the div ine attributes. The study of Kabbalah implies the attraction of the Surrounding Light ( Ohr Makif ) whose function is to reveal to man what his true attributes are. These appear ever more negative, albeit they have remained unchanged ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In fact, man has only become more aware of the true nature of his attributes under the influence of th e divine Light. This sensation is an indication that man has made p rogress, even if he believes to the contrary. What are the Worlds of BYA like? They are the altruistic Kelim which have fallen into the AHP below the Parsa . These worlds are also divided into Galgalta ve Eynaim and AHP s. Their Galgalta ve Eynaim ends in the Hazeh (Chest) of the World of Yetzira , i.e. after the ten Sefirot of the World of Beria and the six Sefirot of the World of Yetzira . The fourteen lower Sefirot from the Hazeh of Yetzira and below (four Sefirot of the World of Yetzira and ten Sefirot of the World of Assiya ) are the AHP s of the Worlds of BYA . The World of Atzilut illuminates with its Light the Worlds of BYA all the way down to the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira . The World of Atzilut is called Shabbat . The sixteen upper Sefirot of the Worlds of BYA ( Galgalta ve Eynaim ), from the Parsa to the Hazeh, are called the “Domain of Shabbat ” ( Tehum Shabbat ) but the World of Atzilut itself is called Yir (city). Even when all the Worlds of BYA ascend to the World of Atzilut , it is still possible to work with desires located below the Parsa up to the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira ( Galgalta ve Eynaim ). That is why in our world, it is allowed during Shabbat to cross the limits of the city, but only in the l imits of the city within the boundaries of Tehum Shabbat . This distance is measured as 2000 ama (approximately 3000 feet) and 70 ama . How is this distance divided? From the Parsa to the Hazeh of the World of Beria it is called Ibur and equals 70 ama . This distance is included in the World of Atzilut even though it is located outside it. It is an out er strip surrounding the city. The distance from the Hazeh of the world Beria to the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira equals 2000 ama . The whole distance between the Parsa and the Sium is 6,000 ama . The portion of the Worlds of BYA stretching from the Hazeh of Yetzira to the Sium is called “a filthy place” – Mador Klipot (the place of the Husks). This Mador Klipot is composed of the AHP s of the Worlds of BYA, which embrace the four Sefirot of the World of Yetzira and the ten Sefirot of the World of Assiya . It is a place absolutely devoid of sanctity ( Kedusha ), one cannot go there during Shabbat . In Israel, cities are surrounded by a special wired fence, which indicates that everything within this fence is related to the city. It is called an Eruv and it creates a unified territory for this city. Within these limits it is permitted to walk, to bring things in and out. When a man ascends to the spiritual world and cross es the Machsom , he need not go through the Mador Klipot . For him the transition to the spiritual does not take p lace during Shabbat , when the Worlds of BYA are in the World of Atzilut . The spiritual Shabbat does not begin at the same time for everybody. In our world, Shabbat sets in at different times in different countries and cities, but if a man is not under the influence of the sun or the moon, for example in th e cosmos, he has to adjust his Shabbat with Jerusalem time: in accordance with the spiritual understanding that th e Creator is in Jerusalem. The souls are lifted to the World of Atzilut to show them what inherent limits exist there, so that they can keep within them. When a man sets himself limits he does not notice t hem, he is above these limitations, and they are no t constraining. Then the actions man undertakes stem from his own a ttributes. The goal of Creation implies a personal ascent, and Shabbat exists in order to show man what exists in the hig her worlds, what there is to strive for. The achievement of correction is when the Light of the Creator shines directly, no longer through the worlds that act like filters. The shining of the Light is unbounded and brings un bridled delight to fulfill the goal of Creation. Lesson 10 Topics examined in this lesson: 70. The First Man ( Adam HaRishon ) 71. The Equivalence of Form 72. The Correction 73. Spiritual Filters To summarize what we have covered so far: Adam HaRishon is the only created being. This Partzuf reaches the height of the three worlds : Beria , Yetzira and Assiya . Its Head is in the World of Beria , the Garon (Throat) spreads to the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira , its Guf"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"(Body) is from the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira stretching all the way to the limits of this world . The Raglaim (Feet) are on the place of the World of Assiya . How are the countries situated in the worlds? The Baal HaSulam says the following, using the lang uage of the Branches: the World of Atzilut is calle d Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel). The nearest place to it, Jordan, is on the place of the World of Beria. Upon the Creator’s command two tribes of Israel, tw o parts of the souls may be situated in Jordan, i.e . in the World of Beria, as the attributes of this world (attribut es of Bina) only differ slightly from the attribute s of the World of Atzilut (Hochma). Syria is considered adjacent to Israel; it is calle d Malchut of the World of Beria. Then, from the Mal chut of the World of Beria, up to the Hazeh of the World of Yet zira, we find the location of Babylon . It is evident that the distance from the Parsa up to the Hazeh of the World of Yetzira still corresponds to Eretz Yisrael and is called Kibbush David , David’s conquests. King David materialized the spiritual in our world. Everything that we study about the spiritual must be materialized in this world, at least once. There are only the Creator and man, i.e. the desire to give delight and the desire to enjoy this delig ht. There are five filters around man which conceal the Light of the Creator, five worlds. If a man acts naturally, according to all his desir es, he finds himself under the influence of these f ilters. All of them are above him. But if a man decides to correct himself in accordan ce with the properties of just one of these filters , even the lowest of them, he will ascend. He will stand above the fi lter and his attributes will match the attributes o f the given world. Furthermore, if his attributes become similar to th ose of the other two worlds, he will neutralize the action of these two filters as well, and will find himself above th em. Then the Light of the Creator will shine directly t hrough his soul. Everything that happens to us betw een life and death is a consequence of what takes place in the s piritual worlds. The Light wants to enter Malchut regardless of its condition. Man has to push the L ight away even though he can receive it. We are now experiencing Tzimtzum , and it seems to us that the Creator no longer wan ts us to perceive Him, that is why He conceals Himself. Actually, if a man, for example, performs a correct ion equal to the World of Assiya , then this means he is located in this world. He has removed the filter he no longer needs as he can now retain the Light and receive it for the sak e of giving. Then he realizes that for the Creator it does not m atter whether we are making the restriction in orde r to receive for His sake or for our own. Simply, man himself reaches a moral level where the re is no distinction between receiving or giving, t ruth and lies, good deeds and transgressions. Man himself chooses what he prefers. But on the Cre ator’s side there is only one desire, to delight ma n. The type of delight depends on the receiver. The main aspect is, without any conditions set by t he Creator, to choose the altruistic ascent even th ough no additional reward or punishment will be incurred. This choice is not on the punishment-reward level, but on the highest spiritual level where selflessne ss and detachment prevail. The Creator places five filters in front of man, to seal him off from the divine Light. Behind the las t, the fifth filter, the Creator is not sensed at all. This is where our material world is located. There also, life is supported by a tiny spark of Li ght ( Ner Dakik ), which is the meaning of our life, the sum of all our desires from all generations, in all souls, since t he dawn of mankind. This Light is so minute that the deeds carried out by the souls are not considered transgressions but are merely considered as minimal animal life. There is no restriction on receiving these minimal pleasures. Live and enjoy... However, if you want more, you have to become simil ar to the spiritual. Each spiritual pleasure means committing a completely altruistic bestowal regardless of yourse lf. To achieve this it is necessary for man to reach a certain level and act like the filter itself, by sh ielding away the incoming Light with the help of his moral strength. The filter then ceases to exist for such a man, and he is able to push away the Light that strives to enter his Kli . This man will later on receive, but for the sake of the Creator. The soul of Adam conformed to the 30 Sefirot of the three Worlds of BYA , which represent the same World of Atzilut , but are located inside egoistic desires with an Aviut Bet , Aviut Gimel and Aviut Dalet ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"When Adam corrects his actions, spiritualizes them, he ascends together with the worlds to the World o f Atzilut . After passing through the 6,000 degrees of correcti on, Adam HaRishon fully ascends to the World of Atzilut . Each soul, being a fragment of the Partzuf of Adam HaRishon , follows the same path. Man himself cannot choose what needs to be correcte d, but corrects what is sent to him from Above, wha t is revealed to him. And so on till the highest level. "}]
