Good opposite evil, good from good, evil from evil. Good makes evil recognizable, and evil makes good recognizable. Good is kept for the good, and evil i s kept for the wicked. 3: Three: Each one stands alone. Seven are divided, three opposite three, with a decree deciding betwe en them. Twelve stand in war: three who love, three who hate , three who give life, and three who kill. The thre e that love are the heart, the ears and the mouth; the three that h ate are the liver. the gall bladder, and the tongue . And God, the faithful King dominates them all. One over three, t hree over seven, and seven over twelve, and all of them are bound, one to another. 4: And when Abraham our father gazed, he looked, sa w, delved, understood, engraved, carved, permuted a nd depicted, and he was successful.

These are the ten ineffable existences, the spi rit of the living God, Air, Water, Fire, Height and Depth, East and West, North and South. Chapter 2 The AlephBeit 1. The foundations are the twenty-two letters, thre e mothers, seven double, and twelve single letters. Three mothers, namely A, M, SH, these are Air, Water, and Fire: Mu te as Water, Hissing as Fire, and Air of a spiritua l type, is as the tongue of a balance standing erect between them pointing out the equilibrium which exists. 2. He hath formed, weighed, transmuted, composed, a nd created with these twenty-two letters every livi ng being, and every soul yet uncreated. 3. Twenty-two letters are formed by the voice, impr essed on the air, and audibly uttered in five situa tions, in the throat, guttural sounds; in the palate, palatals; b y the tongue, linguals; through the teeth, dentals; and by the lips, labial sounds. 4. These twenty-two letters, the foundations, He ar ranged as on a sphere, with two hundred and thirty- one modes of entrance. If the sphere be rotated forward, good is implied, if in a retrograde manner evil is intende d. 5. For He indeed showed the mode of combination of the letters, each with each, Aleph with all, and al l with Aleph. Thus in combining all together in pairs are produce d these two hundred and thirty-one gates of knowled ge. And from Nothingness did He make something, and all for ms of speech and every created thing, and from the empty void He made the solid earth, and from the non-existent He brought forth Life. He hewed, as it were, immense column or colossal pi llars, out of the intangible air, and from the empt y space. And this is the impress of the whole, twenty-one letter s, all from one the Aleph. Chapter 3 The Three Mothers 1. The three mother letters A, M, SH are the founda tions of the whole; and resemble a Balance, the goo d in one scale, the evil in the other, and the oscillating t ongue of the Balance between them. 2. These three mothers enclose a mighty mystery, mo st occult and most marvelous, sealed as with six ri ngs, and from them proceed primeval Fire, Water, and Air; th ese are subsequently differentiated into male and f emale. At first existed these three mothers, and there arose three masculine powers, and hence all things have o riginated. 3. The three mothers are A, M, SH; and in the begin ning as to the Macrocosm the Heavens were created f rom Fire;nthe Earth from primeval Water; and the Air wa s formed from the Spirit, which stands alone in the midst, and is the Mediator between them. 4. In the Year or as regards Time, these three moth ers represent Heat, Cold, and a Temperate climate, the heat from the fire, the cold from the water, and the temperat e state from the spiritual air which again is an eq ualizer between them."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"These three mothers again represent in the Microcos m or Human form, male and female; the Head, the Bel ly, and the Chest; the bead from the fire, the belly from w ater, and the chest from the air lieth between them . 5. These three mothers did he create, form, and des ign, and combine with the three mothers in the worl d, and in the year, and in Man, both male and female. He caused Aleph to reign in the air, and crown it, and combined one with the other, and with these he sealed the Air in the world, the temperate climate of the year, an d the chest (the lungs for breathing air) in man; t he male with A, M, SH, the female with SH, M, A. He caused Mem to p redominate in Water, and crowned it, and combined i t with others, and formed Earth on the world, cold in the year, and the fruit of the womb in mankind, being c arried in the belly. He caused Shin to reign in Fire and crowned it, and he combined one with the other, and sealed them, a s heaven in the universe, as heat in the year, and as the head of Man and Woman. Chapter 4 The Seven Doubles 1. There were formed seven double letters, Beth, Gi mel, Daleth, Kaph, Pe, Resh, Tau, each has two voic es, either aspirated or softened. These are the foundations of Life, Peace, Riches, Beauty or Reputation, Wisdom, Fruitfulness, and Power. These are double, because their opposite s take part in life, opposed to Life is Death; to P eace, War; to Riches, Poverty; to Beauty or Reputation, Deformity or Disrepute; to Wisdom, Ignorance; to Fruitfulnes s, Sterility; to Power, Slavery. 2. These seven double letters point out the dimensi ons, East, West, height, depth, North, South, with the holy temple in the middle, sustaining all things. 3. These seven double letters He formed, designed, created, and combined into the Stars of the Univers e, the days of the week, the orifices of perception in man; and fr om them he made seven heavens, and seven planets, a ll from nothingness, and, moreover, he has preferred and bl essed the sacred Heptad. 4. From two letters, or forms He composed two dwell ings; from three, six; from four, twenty-four; from five, one hundred and twenty; from six, seven hundred and twe nty; from seven, five thousand and forty; and from thence their numbers increase in a manner beyond counting; and a re incomprehensible. These seven are Planets of the Universe, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; the seven days are the days of creation; and these an the seven gateways of a man, two eyes, two ears, two no strils and a mouth, through which he perceives by h is senses.

By these seven letters were also made seven worlds, seven heavens, seven lands, seven seas, seven rive rs, seven deserts, seven days (as before), seven weeks from P assover to Pentecost, and every seventh year a jubi lee.

In proof of these things, and witnessing faithfu lly are the Universe, the Year of time, and Man him self, the Microcosm.

Tali, the Dragon, is above the Universe, as a ki ng on his throne; the sphere in the year as a king in his State, the Heart of man as a king in warfare. And our God made the states of opposition, good and evil, good from the good, and evil from the evil. Happiness is reserved for the just, and misery for the wicked on es. 3. And out of the triad one stands apart; and in th e heptad there are two triads, and one standing apa rt. The dodecad symbolizes war, the triad of amity, the triad of en mity, three which are life-giving, three which are death-dealing, and God, the faithful king, rules over all from the throne of his sanctity. One above three, three above seven, and seven above twelve, and all are linked together, and one with another. 4. After that our father Abraham had seen, and pond ered over, investigated, and understood these thing s, he designed, engraved, and composed them, and received them into his power (hands). Then the Lord of all appeared unto him, made a covenant with him, and kissed his head, and naming him after his own name, called him his friend; and as it is written, completed a covenant with him and with his seed forever, who then believed on Go d, the Tetragrammaton, and it was imputed to him for right eousness. God ordained a covenant between the toes of his fee t, that of circumcision; and a covenant between the fingers of his hands, that of the Tongue. He bound the essences of the twenty-two letters on his tongue, and God disc losed to him the secrets of them. God has carried these through waters, He has borne them aloft through fire, and H e has stamped them in the storms of the air; He has distributed t hem among the seven stars, and has assigned them to twelve celestial constellations.
