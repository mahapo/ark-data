Indeed, one can consider this particular vision a model-vision of Merkavah mysticism.” 4.

Arguments over the dating of this body of literature continue, but there is general agreement to a range of 200-800 C.E. The bounds and structure of these writings are also matters of dispute, for the notions of titles and fixed contents of a specific canon of hekhalot books appear to be more academic conveniences than reflections of the state of the literature. Since the ’seventies, scholarly work on the hekhalot texts has increased dramatically, as the publication dates on a clear majority of the books and articles discussed below attest. Before this spate of academic activity, there were in English little more than Gershom Scholem’s works 6 and Hugo Odeberg’s attempt at a critical edition of one of the hekhalot texts 7 to shed light on this oblique collection of writings. Even as this lament is being recalled, no time should be lost in acknowledging Scholem’s inescapable influence on this and all other aspects of the study of Jewish mysticism. Some of Scholem’s conclusions regarding the hekhalot have been challenged, and some of his observations on and characterizations of the ________________________ 4. cont. > Florentino Garcia Martinez, The Dead Sea Scrolls Translated (Leiden: E.J.

A list of Scholem’s works is given below. Morton Smith’s “Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati,” in Biblical and Other Studies , edited by Alexander Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963) was another early notice. In the ’forties, Smith translated Hekhalot Rabbati into English (the complete text—not just the second half). This translation was circulated among scholars in the field but never published. The typescript was corrected by Scholem, whose occasional notes appear in the margins. Scholem mentions Smith’s translation in Jewish Gnosticism... , page 11, note 4. 7. 3 Enoch or The Hebrew Book of Enoch (1928, Cambridge University Press; rpt New York: Ktav Publishing House, 1973: with a prolegomenon by Jonas C. Greenfield)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 hekhalot texts have come to seem convenient, imposing order on that which is, in fact, near chaos. Yet, Scholem’s writings on this subject remain some of the clearest and best supported. They are also among the most accessible, not only in their style but in their actual availability. As for Odeberg, his lone work is more problematic. As significant as it was , Odeberg’s treatment of Sefer ha-Hekhalot (B OOK OF THE H EKHALOT , dubbed by Odeberg “3 Enoch”) is now considered unreliable and misleading on many points. But, as contemporary scholar David Halperin has pointed out, 8 Odeberg’s work has “proved easier to criticize than to emulate,” for critical editions of hekhalot texts—with English translations or not—are few indeed. Today, however, we are in pretty fair shape to study merkabah mysticism and hekhalot texts, though some of the leading scholars in this field publish in German 9 and, of course, Hebrew. Nevertheless, from the texts and studies now available in English, the persistent reader can certainly gain firm impressions of (i) the contents of the hekhalot texts, (ii) the issues captivating contemporary scholarship regarding the hekhalot texts, and (iii) the place of the hekhalot texts in the history and development of Judaism, early Christianity, and their mysticism. In the following pages, books, sections of books, and articles on merkabah mysticism and hekhalot literature—including translations—are described. I also discuss the various texts attached, however loosely, with the hekhalot corpus, with indications of sources for translations and studies of them. __________ 8. FACES , p. 364. (See below: Halperin). 9. In German there is Peter Schaefer and his team. Certainly, the most significant work which Schaefer has overseen is Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tuebingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1981), which presents in the original Hebrew and Aramaic an array of manuscript readings side by side. Synopse was followed by Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur by the same team (1984, same publisher). Soon after, German translations of Synopse appeared (1987 onward, same publisher). Schaefer has also published a collection of his articles—ten in German, three in English—as Hekhalot-Studien (1988, same publisher)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Studies The best general introduction to hekhalot and merkabah mysticism is Joseph Dan’s Ancient Jewish Mysticism (Tel Aviv: MOD [= Ministry of Defense] Books, 1993). Dan reviews all of the major topics, issues, and texts in a manner which does not exclude the non-specialist. Any reader can appre- ciate this well-grounded overview. 10 Further elaborating on the topics covered in The Ancient Jewish Mysticism is the collection of articles which comprises Dan’s Jewish Mysticism , Volume One: LATE ANTIQUITY (North- vale/Jerusalem: Jason Aronson Inc., 1998). Many of Dan’s articles listed below have been reprinted in this book (hereafter JM1). The works of Gershom Scholem form the basis of contemporary scholarship on Jewish mysticism, and, hence, they provide the foundation of subsequent work on merkabah mysticism and hekhalot texts. Those works by Scholem which address this subject at length are the following: • Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition . New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1960; 2 nd improved edition, 1965. • Kabbalah [articles collected from ENCYCLOPEDIA JUDAICA ]. Jerusalem and New York: Keter Publishing House and Times Books, 1974; rpt. New York, Meridian, 1978; rpt. New York, Dorset Press, 1987. Pages 8-21; pages 373-6 (“Merkabah Mysticism”); and pp. 377- 81 (“Metatron”) • Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism . Jerusalem: Schocken Publishing House, 1941; London: Thames and Hudson, 1955; reprinted fre- quently New York: Schocken Books. Lecture 2 : “ Merkabah Mysticism and Jewish Gnosticism” _________ 10. Ancient Jewish Mysticism expands Dan’s earlier chap book, Three Types of Ancient Jewish Mysticism (University of Cincinnati, 1984), which discusses a. ascent to the divine world b. the mysticism of Hebrew letters c. Sar Torah (Prince of the Torah) revelations ( Three Types of Ancient Jewish Mysticism = JM1: Chapter 2.)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Besides Dan’s works on ancient Jewish mysticism and Scholem’s Jewish Gnosticism... , there are a number of studies which focus on the topic of merkabah/hekhalot mysticism: • Arbel, Vita Daphna. Beholders of Divine Secrets: Mysticism and Myth in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature . Albany: State University of New York Press, 2003. Arbel’s summary of hekhalot and merkabah literature and scholarly approaches to it is not as engaging or detailed as, for instance, the introduction in Davila’s Descenders to the Chariot (see below). However, Arbel nicely treats the question, “What is MYSTICAL about hekhalot/merkabah mysticism?” i.e., what are its “mystical” characteristics and intentions? FROM THE SUNY PRESS CATALOGUE (Spring 2003): “While previous scholarship has demonstrated the connection between Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and parallel traditions in Rabbinical writings, the Dead Sea Scrolls, apocalyptic, early Christian, and Gnostic sources, this work points out additional mythological traditions that resonate in this literature. Arbel suggests that mythological patterns of expression, as well as themes and models rooted in Near Eastern mythological traditions are employed, in spiritualized fashion, to communicate mystical content.” • Chernus, Ira. Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism: Studies in the History of Midrash [ STUDIA JUDAICA , Band XI]. Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1982. This series of essays shows the relationship between merkabah mysticism and rabbinic midrashim following, generally, two motifs: the revelation on Mount Sinai and the eschatological rewards of the world to come. • Davila, James R. Descenders to the Chariot: The People behind the Hekhalot Literature [ SUPPLEMENT TO THE JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF JUDAISM , Volume 70]. Leiden/Boston/Koln: Brill, 2001. In the first chapter, Davila provides an excellent summary of the issues and debates in hekhalot scholarship. He then makes his case for understanding the hekhalot texts as not being mere literary constructs but as describing the experiences of real practitioners, whom Davila likens to shamans, i.e., “religious functionaries,” “intermediaries” seeking “to gain power over the spiritual world.” • Deutsch, Nathaniel. The Gnostic Imagination. Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Merkabah Mysticism [ BRILL’S SERIES ON JEWISH STUDIES , 13]. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1995. Deutsch gives an account of the relationship between Gnosticism and merkabah mysticism using Scholem’s written statements on these as a starting point. He surveys a range of scholarly opinion on issues surrounding these topics, drawing on many of the writers mentioned in this bibliography. Deutsch summarizes his view of Scholem on page 36: “Even though his [Scholem’s] comparative analysis of Gnosticism and Merkabah mysticism is problematic from a number of methodological perspectives, its role as an intellectual catalyst cannot be overstated.” • Deutsch, Nathaniel. Guardians of the Gate. Angelic Vice Regency in Late Antiquity [ BRILL’S SERIES IN JEWISH STUDIES , 22]. Leiden: Brill, 1999."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 “Within Merkabah mysticism, God is frequently depicted as an exalted and highly remote figure. Thus, Scholem was partly right when he described the gulf between humans and the God in Merkabah mysticism. Yet, Scholem erred when he emphasized the impossibility of closing this gulf—that is, when he defined the God of Merkabah mysticism as absolutely inaccessible or transcendent. How was the distance between human beings and God breached in Merkabah mysticism? The answer to this question requires an appreciation of the paradoxical nature of the angelic vice regent” ( Guardians , p. 9). Deutsch discusses Metatron in this role, with comments on Akatriel; he then examines similar figures in Gnosticism (Sabaoth) and Mandaeism (Abathur). • Elior, Rachel. The Three Temples: On the Emergence of Jewish Mysticism , translated by David Louvish [= MIKDASH U-MERKAVAH, KOHANIM U- MAL’AKHIM, HEKHAL BA-MISTIKAH HA YEHIDIT HA-KEDUMAH , 2002]. Oxford / Portland: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. Elior details the traditions and literature leading up to the hekhalot texts. She writes, “Heikhalot literature preserves the living continuation of the sacred service by recovering it from the realm of space and time: the Temple/ heikhal is lifted up to the heavens, and the priests serving therein become the ministering angels in the supernal Temples; the sacred service in these heavenly sanctuaries is described explicitly in terms of the rituals of the earthly Temple. This metamorphosis is implemented through the terminology of Merkavah mysticism, combining the hallowed memory of ritual with creative imagination and visionary inspiration, creating a bridge between the ‘revealed’ and the ‘hidden’” ( INTRODUCTION , pages 14-15). Refer, however, to the critical comments made about Elior’s Three Temples by the presenters (Nehemia Polen, Alan F. Segal, Jonah Steinberg, and Lawrence H. Schiffman) at the 36 th Annual Conference of the Association for Jewish Studies (Chicago: December 19-21, 2004), Section 4.5, H EAVENLY S ECRETS AND H UMAN A UTHORITY IN THE T HOUGHT OF S ECTARIANS , S AGES , AND E ARLY J EWISH M YSTICS , chair: Rebecca Lesses (CDs and tapes available from Content Management Corporation, 3043 Footh ill Blvd., Suite #2, La Crescenta, CA 91214: 818-857-0874). • Eskola, Timo.

Eskola says in the introduction (page 17), “...it will be the main purpose of this work to investigate the relationship between Jewish merkabah mysticism and New Testament exaltation Christology by focusing on the central metaphor of the throne.

Perhaps the most striking similarity is that they all are represented as the possessor of the Name of God, the concept of which plays an enormous role in Judaism.

(hereafter FACES) FACES is a thorough study which challenges many conclusions and assumptions of previous scholars, tracing merkabah material from the Bible, through the apocalypses and rabbinic literature, concluding with the hekhalot texts. Translations of the text Re’iyot Yezkiel (V ISIONS OF E ZEKIEL ) and other important segments of hekhalot material are included. FACES is valuable in a way that few books of this ilk are in that Halperin invites the reader to engage in his entire scholarly process, which he lays out in great detail in his 450-page text, two-tiered notes (footnotes and endnotes), seven informative appendices (Appendix I: “Orientation to Rabbinic Sources” is especially helpful), and full reference list (which is divided into sixteen sections according to topic). • Halperin, David J.

Alas, here we enter directly into the question of what is and what is not a member of the hekhalot family; the canons offered by various scholars differ. For instance, Schaefer’s Synopse includes some items which some commentators find dubious, namely, T HE S WORD OF M OSES and Seder Rabba di Bereshit . One well-known text, T HE V ISIONS OF E ZEKIEL , while almost always included on lists of hekhalot texts, is clearly of a character different from the so-called “core group.” Discussions regarding which texts belong to the hekhalot canon have progressed along several lines: 1. Texts which have long been counted among the hekhalot are now thought not to belong, for example, T HE V ISIONS OF E ZEKIEL . 2. Magical works, such as T HE S WORD OF M OSES and Sefer ha-Razim , are being drawn closer to the hekhalot . 3. Some works are being wholly reconsidered in that they might not be works at all but rather of one genre or another, as, for instance, the Shi’ur Qomah and Sar Torah texts. As mentioned already, even the titles of these “books” are late inventions which have become con ventions, used even by the scholars who refute their validity.

Gruenwald’s chapter on MR in AMM begins with a description of material which probably does not belong to it, namely, a portion of the Sar ha-Panim (ShP, P RINCE OF THE P RESENCE , or C OUNTENANCE ). Peter Schaefer treats ShP as an independent text in “Die Beschworung des Sar ha-Panim: Kritische Edition und Ubersetzung” (T HE A DJURATION OF THE P RINCE OF THE C OUNTENANCE : C RITICAL E DITION AND T RANSLATION ), originally in Frankfurter Judaische Beitrage , vol. 6 (1978); reprinted in Schaefer’s Hekhalot-Studien.

Certainly, the convenient notion of a neat separation be- tween ascent texts and magic texts can no longer be sustained. Of late, the tendency among scholars is to dismiss such loaded terms as “magic” (a negative term— vs “theurgy” or “religion,” positive terms) and “mysticism” to concentrate on the methods and aims of Jewish, usually along with early Christian and pagan (Greco-Roman), rituals and how these reflect the mindset and beliefs of their era. On this trend, see, for example, Rebecca Macy Lesses’ Ritual Practices to Gain Power (summary statement on pages 11-13), James R. Davila’s Descenders to the Chariot ( CHAPTER 2 discusses the difficulties of the words “mysticism,” “magic,” and “shamanism”), and Naomi Janowitz’ Icons of Power ( INTRODUCTION ).
