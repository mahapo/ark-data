[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"JUNG AND THE KABBALAH Sanford L. Drob The following article is based on a presentation de livered at the American Psychological Association's Annual Convention, August, 1998. It originally appeared in History of Psychology. May, 1999 Vol 2(2), pp. 102 -118. A more detailed discussion of Jung and the Kabbalah appears in Kabbalistic Metaphors, Chapter 8, pp. 2 89- 343. In a forthcoming book I will provide a detailed analys is of Jung¹s relationship with National Socialism, and discuss in greater detail what I r egard to be Jung¹s teshuvah (penitence) during and after his 1944 heart attack, after which he experienced Kabbalistic visions and saw himself as Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai. Summary: Jung's use of Kabbalistic symbols and idea s as well as his personal Kabbalistic vision are cr itically examined. It is argued that as great as Jung's ackn owledged affinity is to the Kabbalah, his unacknowl edged relationship was even greater. Jung has been accuse d of being a contemporary Gnostic. However, the int erpretations which Jung places on Gnosticism and the texts which Jung refers to on alchemy, were profoundly Kabbali stic, so much so that one would be more justified in calling the Jung of the Mysterium Coniunctionis and other late works, a Kabbalist in contemporary guise. While Jung, at lea st during 1930s, appears to have had powerful motiv es which limited his receptivity to Jewish ideas, his highly ambivalent and at times reproachable attitude towa rd Judaism should not prevent us from appreciating the affinit ies between Jungian psychology and Jewish mystical thought. _______ In a letter to the Reverend Erastus Evans, written on the 17th of February 1954, Carl Jung described t he excitement of his first encounter with the Kabbalistic symbols of Shevirat ha-Kelim (the breaking of the vessels) and tikkun haolam (the restoration of the world): In a tract of the Lurianic Kabbalah, the remarkable idea is developed that man is destined to become G od's helper in the attempt to restore the vessels which were broken when God thought to create a world. Onl y a few weeks ago, I came across this impressive doctri ne which gives meaning to man's status exalted by t he incarnation. I am glad that I can quote at least on e voice in favor of my rather involuntary manifesto (Jung, 1973, Vol. 2, p. 157). Several years later, in a letter to a Ms. Edith Sch roeder who had inquired regarding \"the significance of Freud's Jewish descent for the origin, content and acceptan ce of psychoanalysis.\" Jung replies: ....one would have to take a deep plunge into the h istory of the Jewish mind. This would carry us beyo nd Jewish Orthodoxy into the subterranean workings of Hasidism...and then into the intricacies of the Kabbalah, which still remains unexplored psychologi cally (Jung, 1973, Vol. 2, pp. 358-9). Jung then informs Ms. Schroeder that he himself cou ld not perform such a task because he has no knowle dge of Hebrew and is not acquainted with all the relevant sources. In point of fact, Jung, in the last decades of his life, had taken a deep interest in the psychologica l aspects of a number of Kabbalistic symbols and ideas; ideas whic h he had been exposed to primarily through his read ing of 16th and 17th century alchemical texts, and, especially, through the writings of the Christian Kabbalist an d alchemist, Christian Knorr Von Rosenroth (1636-89). As a resul t, Jung's last great work, Mysterium Coniunctionis, completed in his 80th year in 1954, though ostensibly a treat ise on alchemy, is filled with discussions of such Kabbalistic symbols as Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man), the Sefiro t, and the union of the \"Holy One\" and his bride. T hese symbols became important pivots around which Jung c onstructed his final interpretations of such notion s as the archetypes and the collective unconscious, and his theory of the ultimate psychological purpose of hum ankind. Yet as great as Jung's acknowledged affinity is to the Kabbalah, his unacknowledged relationship was e ven greater. For every reference to the Kabbalah in Jung's writi ngs there are several to Gnosticism, and perhaps do zens to alchemy: yet the interpretations which Jung places on Gnosticism (itself a close cousin to the Kabbala h), and the very texts which Jung refers to on alchemy, were pr ofoundly Kabbalistic, so much so that one could cal l the Jung of the Mysterium Coniunctionis and other later works, a Kabbalist (albeit a Christian one) in contemporar y guise. Jung has frequently been called a \"Gnostic.\" Intere stingly, Jung¹s main accuser in this regard was the Jewish philosopher, Martin Buber, who is well known for, a mongst other things, his work on Hasidism. Buber he ld that Jung was Gnostic because he reduced God to the inne r divine spark in humans and identified religious e xperience with a turning inward into the Self, as opposed to a participation in relations with others as the vehicle for relating to a transcendent God (Buber, 1952; see also Dourley, 1994)). Conversely, the Christian \"death of God\" th eologian, Thomas J. J. Altizer, hailed Jung¹s \"Gnosticism\" as part of his proof of the death of a transcendent G od, which, through Christ, had become completely immanent in h umankind (Altizer, 1959, see also Segal, 1992). For reasons which I will detail in this paper, it i s my view that Jung is far more Kabbalistic than he is Gnostic, and he is \"alchemical\" largely to the extent that the a lchemists borrowed from and relied upon Kabbalistic ideas. I will"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"also argue that in the 1930s, when Jung was formula ting a psychology based on his reading of alchemy, he had a strong motive to suppress the \"Jewish\" origins of m any alchemical ideas. In this essay, I argue that Jung ultimately read Gn osticism in such a manner as to transform a radical anti-cosmic, anti-individualistic doctrine into a world-affirmin g basis for an individual psychology. Further, I wi ll show that he interpreted alchemy so as to extract its Kabbalisti c spiritual and psychological core. Had Jung been s ufficiently familiar with the Kabbalists (and Hasidim), his tas k could have been far easier, for their writings wo uld have provided Jung a psychologically richer and more sym pathetic symbolism than either the \"other worldly\" theories of the Gnostics, or the radically material practice of the alchemists. Indeed, in some instances the Gnos tics, the alchemists, and the Kabbalists share the same symbo ls and images ( e.g., the \"sparks,\" \"Primordial Man\") but in each case the Kabbalistic approach to these symbols is t he closest to Jung's own. In short, by providing a \"this-worldly\" interpretation of Gnosticism, and a spiritual-psych ological interpretation of alchemy, Jung arrived at a view which was in many ways Kabbalistic in spirit. Indeed, Jun g, in his interpretation of alchemy, succeeded rema rkably in extracting the Kabbalistic gold which lay buried in the alchemists¹ texts and methods (to use an alche mical metaphor). His work can then be profitably understo od as falling in the tradition of those thinkers su ch as Pico della Mirandola, Johannnes Reuchlin (1983), and Knorr von Rosenroth who created a distinctively Christian Ka bbalah (Scholem, 1974, [pp. 196-201]). Jung can be interpreted as a contemporary Kabbalist , yet one who provides the basis for a radical psyc hological interpretation of the Kabbalists¹ symbols and ideas . Such an interpretation was not altogether foreign to the Kabbalists themselves, who, on the principle of the microcosm mirroring the macrocosm, held that their own descriptions of cosmic events were also, and equall y profoundly, descriptions of the dynamics within m en's souls (Idel, 1988, 1995). Indeed, such an interpretation of the Kabbalah provided the major impetus for the doctrines of the Hasidim. Still, Jung took this psychologization process further than either the Kabbalists or Hasi dim, living in a pre-psychoanalytic age, could ever hope to do thems elves. The Kabbalah The Kabbalah, the most developed expression of Jewi sh mysticism, is a vast subject that today commands its own field of study. Rooted in early Jewish mysticism, a nd, regarded by many as a Jewish form of Gnosticism (Scholem , 1961/1941, 1960), the Kabbalah achieved its own uni que expression in the anonymous Sefer HaBahir, gene rally regarded as the earliest extant text in this mystic al genre (Scholem, 1987/1962). It is in this work t hat the theory of the ten Sefirot, the value archetypes (Will, Wisdom , Understanding, Kindness, Judgment, Beauty, Glory, Splendor, Foundation and Kingship) which the Kabbalists all h eld to be the essence of creation, takes distinctiv e form. The locus classicus, however, for the Sefirot and other Kabbalistic symbols, is the Zohar (Sperling & Simo n, 1931-34; Tishby & Lachower, 1989), traditionally attributed to the rabbinic sage Shimon Bar Yohai (with whom, a s we shall see, Jung identified himself), but thought by conte mporary scholars to have originated in Spain some t ime in the thirteenth century. The Zohar, which is written as a loose and far-reaching commentary on the Torah (t he Five Books of Moses), is the source of much of the \"wedd ing symbolism\" (unifications of the various Sefirot ) which preoccupied the alchemists studied by Jung. Its hom ilies on the nature of the unknowable infinite, the masculin e and the feminine, and the relationship between good and evil can provide much of interest to analytic and archetypal psychologists. Jung himself quoted a number of Zoha ric passages, and appears to have been acquainted w ith both a German and English translation of portions of this book. It is, however, the radical reformulation of the Ka bbalah, initiated by Isaac Luria (1534-1572 ) and r ecorded by his disciples, notably Chayyim Vital (1542-1620), which is of the greatest interest from a Jungian perspec tive. Luria's ideas were little known outside orthodox Jewish cir cles, however, until Gershom Scholem brought them t o the attention of the intellectual world in the 1930s an d 40s (Scholem, 1961/1941). The Lurianic Kabbalah i s of interest in part because of its systematic and dynamic treat ment of many of the symbols and conceptions of the earlier Kabbalah (see Elior, 1993, Jacobs, 1987, Schochet, 1981 and Scholem 1973, 1974). Jung's Familiarity with the Kabbalah Jung does not appear to have had any in-depth knowl edge of the original texts of the Kabbalah. While M ysterium Coniunctionis includes citations to the Sperling an d Simon English translation of the Zohar (first pub lished in 1931- 4) as well as to a German translation of the Zohar by Ernst Mueller (Jung, 1963, pp. 634, 47), the maj ority of Jung's specific citations to Kabbalistic symbols and ideas are to the writings of Knorr Von Rosenroth, whose Kabbalah Denudata, published in 1684 is a Latin translatio n of passages from the Zohar, other Kabbalistic wri tings, and essays on the meaning of the Kabbalah (Scholem, 1974). Kno rr¹s work was the most important non-Hebrew referen ce on"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the Kabbalah up until the close of the 19th century and was the major source on the Kabbalah for non-J ewish scholars at least up to that time. Knorr, writing a fter the advent and dissemination of the Lurianic K abbalah, includes (amongst many other things) Latin translations of p ortions of the Zohar, Cordovero¹s Pardes Rimmonim, a detailed explanation of the Kabbalistic tree after Luria, an d even some of the writings of Luria himself. Jung had \"visions\" inspired by the symbolism of the Kabbalist Moses Cordovero (Jung, 1961. Pp. 293-5), and Cordovero's Pardes Rimonim is cited in the bibliogr aphy of Mysterium Coniunctionis, but the only actua l reference is in a single footnote, and this is cited through Knorr (Jung, 1963, p. 22). While Jung was clearly a ware of the writings of Gershom Scholem, he appears not to have read them closely prior to 1954. Otherwise he woul d have undoubtedly been familiar with certain doctrines of the Lurianic Kabbalah such as the breaking of the vessels and tikkun prior to the date he acknowledges in his let ter to Evans in February of that year. Jung carried on a correspondence with a number of students who had fi rst-hand knowledge of Kabbalistic texts and even acknowledges to R. J. Zwi Werblosky that he receive d a copy of the Kabbalist R. Gikatila¹s text on dre ams (Jung, 1973, Vol. 2, p. 122), but the overwhelming evidenc e in both the Mysterium and the Letters is that Jun g derived his working knowledge of the Kabbalah from Knorr Von Ro senroth, references to the Kabbalah in the writings of such alchemists as Dorn, and an occasional perusal of th e French and German literature on the Kabbalah extant before the field was thoroughly transformed by Scholem. Jung's limited familiarity with Kabbalistic texts a nd ideas in no way prevented him from commenting pr ofoundly and in some detail on certain Kabbalistic symbols, such as the Sefirot, of which he was aware. The major Kabbalistic ideas which concerned Jung we re those that had clear parallel formations in Gnos ticism and alchemy: the notion of a spark of divine light cont ained within humanity, the concept of Primordial Ad am who contains within himself in coincidentia oppositorum the various conflicting tendencies within the huma n spirit, the theory of divine unifications, particularly the uni fications of good and evil and masculine and femini ne. In spite of an occasional reference to Luria, absent from any d etailed consideration in Jung's major works are the symbols of Tzimtzum (Divine Contraction), Shevirah (the \"Break ing of the Vessels\", Tikkun Haolam (the \"Restoratio n of the World) which are unique to the Lurianic Kabbalah. I t is true, however, that just as these Lurianic con cepts were implicit in the Kabbalah that preceded Luria (e.g., the Zohar), they are, as we will see, also implici t in the alchemical writings which borrowed so heavily from the earlier Kabbalah. Had Jung considered these symbols prior to 1954, they would have been of invaluable service to him, not only in his attempt to grasp the spiritual and psychological nature of alchemy, but also in the expression of hi s own psychology of the self. Jung's Interpretive Method Jung's interpretation of Gnosticism, indeed his int erpretation of religious phenomena in general, rest s upon his theory of the history of the human psyche (Segal, 1 992, pp. 11-13). According to Jung, humankind has h istorically moved from a condition in which it projects the con tents of its unconscious onto the world and heavens to one in which, as a result of a total identification with t he rational powers of the ego, it has not only with drawn its projections from the world but fails completely to recognize the archetypes of the unconscious mind. T hese archetypes, however, reappear in the form of neurot ic symptoms. Jung writes: The gods have become diseases; Zeus no longer rules Olympus but rather the solar plexus, and produces curious specimens for the doctor¹s consulting room, or disorders the brains of politicians and journal ists who unwittingly let loose psychic epidemics on the world. (Jung, 1967, p. 37) Psychology, specifically Jungian psychology, is in a position to provide individuals with a direct awa reness of the archetypes within their own psyches. This, Jung bel ieves, can be accomplished through an interpretatio n of the spontaneous symbolic projections of the unconscious in fantasy, art, and dreams, guided by a new psych ological understanding of the basic archetypal images which have presented themselves in the history of myth an d religion. Jung turns to this history for a catalogue or map o f the contents of the collective unconscious and he interprets his patients¹ (archetypal) dreams and images accordingly. His interest in the \"dead\" religion of Gnosticism, as well as in the forgotten science of alchemy, lies in the fact that their symbols presumably contain a more or les s pristine crystallization of the collective unconscious, undi sturbed by the ego oriented reinterpretations of re ason and dogma. Indeed the long incognizance of the Kabbalah in off icial Judaism suggests that it too preserves elemen ts of the collective unconscious in a relatively pure form. Jung and Gnosticism: The Seven Sermons To the Dead Jung's interpretation of Gnosticism is critical to his understanding of the Kabbalah. This is not only because many of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the major Kabbalistic themes are anticipated in the Gnostic sources with which Jung was familiar, but because Jung¹s general approach to both alchemy and the Kab balah was shaped by his interpretation of the Gnost ics. The identity of Gnosticism is itself open to consid erable debate (see Filoramo, 1990; Robinson, 1988; Rudolph, 1987; on the Jewish origin of Gnosticism see Schole m, 1946, 1960; and Wilson, 1975). Traditionally Gno sticism was viewed as a Christian heresy which developed al ong-side the early Catholic Church in the second an d third centuries. The discovery in 1945 of a library of Gn ostic texts at Nag Hammadi along the Nile River in Egypt, and their eventual publication, has led to a view of Gn osticism as a multifaceted religious phenomenon ind ependent of Christianity. The origins of Gnosticism are far from clear. Some scholars, notably Quispel (Jonas, 1965), have hypot hesized a Jewish origin to this syncretistic religious phenom enon. Other scholars have looked to the Qumran text s of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other apocryphal texts of Judaism, e.g., The Book of Wisdom and The Book of Enoch, whi ch date from just before and during the advent of the Chris tian era, for the origins of the Gnostic quest for ontological knowledge and personal illumination (Filoramo, 1990 ). Scholars have also differed in opinions regarding t he identity and defining characteristics of Gnostic ism, some pointing, for example, to its dualism of good and e vil, others to its theories regarding the aeons, an d the demiurge. However, the Congress of Messina on the origins of Gnosticism distinguished between \"gnosis\" in genera l as \"knowledge of the divine mysteries reserved for an elite\" and \"Gnosticism\" proper, which it defined as follows: The Gnosticism of the second-century sects involves a coherent series of characteristics that can be summarized in the idea of a divine spark in man, de riving from the divine realm, fallen into this worl d of fate, birth, and death, and needing to be awakened by the divine counterpart of the self in order to b e finally reintegrated (into the divine realm). (Filoramo, 19 90, p. 143) Jung's comments on Gnosticism are scattered through out his writings (See Segal, 1992), but his major s tatement on the subject is contained in his essay \"Gnostic symb ols of the self\" (Jung, 1969). However, long before he had systematically considered Gnosticism from the point of view of his own analytical psychology, Jung had been familiar with Gnostic theology and even constructed , in 1916, his own \"Gnostic Myth\" which he had circ ulated privately amongst friends but which, at his own req uest, was excluded from his collected works (but pu blished in Segal, 1992). In this myth, entitled \"Septem Sermon es ad Mortuos\" (Seven Sermons to the Dead) Jung reg isters a number of \"Gnostic\" themes to which he was to retur n many times in his later writings . Amongst these themes, perhaps the most significant and pervasive is a concern with the coincidence of opposites and the unification of antinomies. \"Harken\", Jung w rites, \"I begin with nothingness. Nothingness is th e same as fullness. In infinity full is no better than empty. Nothingness is both empty and full\" (Segal, 1992, p. 181). The \"pleroma\" (or fullness of being which for the Gnost ics is the equivalent of the Kabbalistic Ein-Sof, t he infinite) is characterized, Jung tells us, by \"pairs of opposite s\", such as \"living and dead\", \"Good and Evil\", \"Be auty and Ugliness\", \"the one and the many\". These opposites are equal and hence void in the pleroma but are \"di stinct and separate\" in the human mind. A variety of other typically Gnostic themes make th eir appearance in \"The Seven Sermons\". Amongst thes e are the doctrine that humans, as finite creatures, are char acterized by \"distinctiveness,\" and the natural str iving of humankind is towards distinctiveness and individuat ion. However, this battle against sameness and cons equent death is ultimately futile because our pursuit of various distinctions inevitably leads us to seize each of their opposites. In pursuing good and beauty we necessarily lay hold of evil and ugliness as well. Hence, humans should no t strive after difference, which is at any rate, illusory, but rat her after their own Being, which leads them to an e xistential (rather than an epistemological) awareness of the pleromati c \"star\" which is humanity¹s ultimate essence and g oal (Segal, 1992). Jung's prescription for humankind in \"The Seven Ser mons\" is significant because it appears to be so ty pically Gnostic. This world of distinctiveness and individu ation offers humans nothing. They must turn their b acks on the world of \"creatura\" and follow their inner star bey ond this cosmos, for, according to Jung: Weakness and nothingness here, there eternally crea tive power. Here nothing but darkness and chilling moisture. There wholly sun. (Segal, 1992, p. 193) Years later, when Jung comes to take a second look at Gnosticism through the eyes of a more fully deve loped archetypal psychology, he reverses himself and inte rprets it in a manner which is far more friendly to the world and the individual, and, as I will argue, far more Kabb alistic than Gnostic. Jung's Interpretation of Gnosticism "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jung eventually interpreted the Gnostic myths, incl uding the origin of the cosmos in the Pleroma, the emergence of an ignorant God or demiurge, the creation of a Prim ordial Man, and the placing of a spark of divinity within individual persons, in completel y psychological terms. The Gnostic myths do not, ac cording to Jung, refer to cosmic or even external human events, but rather reflect t he basic archetypal developments of the human psych e. Jung regards the pleroma, within which is contained the undifferentiated unity of all opposites and contrad ictions, as nothing but the primal unconscious from which the h uman personality will emerge. The \"demiurge\", whom the Gnostics disparaged as being ignorant of its plerom atic origins, represents the conscious, rational eg o, which in its arrogance believes that it too is both the creator and master of the human personality. The spark, or scintilla, which is placed in the human soul, represents the possibi lity of the psyche's reunification with the unconsc ious, and the primal anthropos (Adam Kadmon or Christ), which is related to this spark, is symbolic of the \"Self\", t he achieved unification of a conscious, individuated personalit y with the full range of oppositions and archetypes in the unconscious mind. \"Our aim,\" Jung tells us, \"is to create a wider personality whose centre of gravity does not necessarily coincide with the ego,\" but rather \"in the hypothetical point between conscious and uncons cious\" (Jung, 1929/1968, p. 45). Jung sees in the Gnostic (and Ka bbalistic) symbol of Primordial Man a symbol of the goal of his own analytical psychology. Jung's Interpretation of Alchemy Jung provides a similar if more daring and far reac hing interpretation of alchemy. According to Jung, what the alchemist sees in matter, and understands in his fo rmulas for the transmutation of metals and the deri vation of the prima materia, \"is chiefly the data of his own unco nscious which he is projecting into it\" (Jung, 1937 /1968, p. 228). For example, the alchemist¹s efforts to bring about a union of opposites in the laboratory and to perf orm what is spoken of as a \"chymical wedding\" are understood by Jung as attempts to forge a unity, e.g., between m asculine and feminine, or good and evil aspects of the psyche (J ung, 1937/1968). \"The alchemical opus\", Jung tells us, \"deals in the main not just with chemical experiments as such , but with something resembling psychic processes e xpressed in pseudochemical language\" (Jung, 1932/1968, p. 242). I n his Mysterium Coniunctionis Jung (1955-6/1963) provides a catalog of alchemical symbols which are rich in spiritual and psychological significance. Many of t he most significant of these symbols, including the notions of Adam Kadmon, the divine spark in humanity, the unio n of the cosmic King and Queen, and the divine natu re of evil (each of which Jung regarded as foundational for hi s later psychology) were imported into alchemy from the Kabbalah. Kabbalah and Alchemy Jung himself was aware of the strong relationship b etween the Kabbalah and late alchemy, and frequentl y spoke of specific Kabbalistic influences on the alchemists o f the 16th century and later. \"Directly or indirect ly\", Jung (1955- 6/1963)writes in the Mysterium, \"the Cabala was ass imilated into alchemy. Relationships must have exis ted be tween them at a very early date, though it is difficult t o trace them in the sources\" (p. 24; cf. p. 384). J ung points out that by the end of the 16th century the alchemists began ma king direct quotations from the Zohar. For example, he provides a quotation from Blasius Vigenerus (1523-96) compar ing the feminine sefirah Malchut with the moon turn ing its face from the intelligible things of heaven (Jung, 1955-6/1963, p. 24). He points to a number of alche mists, including Khunrath and Dorn who made extensive use of the Kabbalistic notion of Adam Kadmon as early a s the 16th century, and informs us that works by Reuchlin (De Arte Kabalistica, 1517) and Mirandola had made the Kabbalah accessible to non-Jews at that time (Jung, 1955-6/1963, see also Reuchlin, 1983). Both Vigene rus and Knorr Von Rosenroth, Jung informs us, attempted to relate the alchemical notion of the lapis or philos opher¹s stone to passages in the Zohar which interpret biblical v erses (Job 38:6, Isaiah, 28:16, Genesis 28:22) as m aking reference to a stone with essential, divine and transformativ e powers (Jung, 1955-6/1963). He also notes that Pa racelsus had introduced the sapphire as an \"arcanum\" into alchem y from the Kabbalah. Two of the alchemists most fre quently quoted by Jung (Knorr and Khunrath) wrote treatises on the Kabbalah, and others such as Dorn and Lully were heavily influenced by Kabbalistic ideas. These auth ors included a notion of the \"sparks\", which was to become a key element in the Lurianic Kabbalah, and gave it a Kab alistic (as opposed to Gnostic) interpretation in t heir work. While Jung clearly recognizes the relationship betw een Kabbalah and alchemy, he only provides us with part of the story. The spiritual aspects of alchemy, which inte rested Jung, were to a very large extent Jewish in origin. Even Jung¹s own view of alchemy appears to have its orig ins in Jewish sources. Maria the Prophetess, the Eg yptian Hellenistic Jewess who is regarded by Zosimos (3d c entury) to be the founder of alchemy (and by modern scholarship to be amongst its earliest practitioner s), viewed the alchemical work as fundamentally a p rocess through"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which the adept attains spiritual perfection (Patai , 1994). Maria regarded the various metals in the a lchemical work to be analogous to aspects of humanity, hence her f amous maxim \"Join the male and the female and you w ill find what is sought\" (Patai, 1994, p. 66), an aphorism w hich could well serve as a motto for much of Jung¹s own interpretation of alchemy. Space limitations prevent me from providing anythin g like a full survey of the Kabbalistic sources of the spiritual side of alchemy. The interested reader is referred to works by Suler (1972), and Patai (1994). Jung's Understanding of the Kabbalah Jung brought the same interpretive posture to the K abbal ah that he had brought to Gnosticism and alchemy. O nly his approach to the Kabbalistic tradition was far less systematic and his views on this tradition must occ asionally be pieced together from his discussions of parallel Gn ostic and alchemical ideas. Amongst the Kabbalistic notions which were of significance to Jung (or are signific ant from a Jungian perspective) are Ein-Sof (the In finite), Tzimtzum (Divine contraction), Adam Kadmon (Primord ial Man), Shevirat ha- Kelim (The Breaking of the Vessels), Kellipot (Shells or Husks), the separation of the K ing and Queen, Tikkun Haolom (The Restoration of th e World), and Partzufim (Visages). I will discuss each of the se in turn. (1) Ein-sof (the Infinite) is the limitless, unknowable, procr eative source of all being, which is the union of everything and its opposite. Jung had interpreted t he Gnostics¹ pleroma, a conception of the divine th at is essentially equivalent to the Kabbalist¹s Ein-sof, as the infin ite, unknowable depths of the collective unconsciou s. For Jung (1955-6/1963), Ein-sof, like the pleroma, is the ch aotic unknown which unites within itself all contra sts and oppositions and which humanity returns to time and again as the wellspring of creativity and desire. (2) Tzimtzum (Divine contraction) is, according to the Lurianis ts, the concealment, negation and withdrawal of God¹s presence which \"makes room\" for the world. Th e Lurianists invoked this symbol as a vehicle of tr ansition from an infinite God to the finite world. According ly, the original act of creation was a negation in which the Infinite contracts and conceals itself from itself in order to bring about a finite realm. Jung makes no mention of Tzimtzum. However, this notion of self \"contraction \" and \"concealment\" can readily be understood psych ologically as an archetypal limitation or repression which sep arates the ego from the unconscious. (3) Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man) embodies the ten value archetypes (Sefirot) through which the world was created. Jung reflected in detail on this Kabbalist ic notion, noting that a cosmic primordial man is a symbol which appears in many of the world¹s myths of creation. F or Jung, Adam Kadmon is a symbol of the \"Self\" (Jun g, 1955- 6/1963, p. 50), as it unites within itself the full range of values (the Sefirot) through which both t he world and humankind were created. It is important to note tha t, for the Kabbalists, Adam Kadmon is in a constant state of transformation and renewal, and only fully becomes himself subsequent to the \"Breaking of the Vessels\" and their reconstruction in Tikkun. It is thus no wonder that Jung equated Adam Kadmon with the alchemists¹ Merc urius (Jung, 1955-6/1963, pp. 10, 394; Jung, 1937/1968, p . 319), and regarded Adam Kadmon as an important sy mbol of psychological transformation (Jung, 1955-6/1963, p. 429). (4) Shevirat ha-Kelim , (The Breaking of the vessels) is an archetypal ev ent in which the value archetypes were shattered and distributed throughout the cosmos as \"sparks\". Jung, as we have seen, was fascinated by the Kabbalistic symbols of the Breaking of the Vessels and Tikkun (the vessels \"Repair\") when he chanced u pon these ideas in 1954. For him, they represented the role t hat humankind must play in the restoration of the w orld, the redemption of evil, and the restoration of the Self . However, even prior to that time Jung had encount ered these notions in their alchemical guises, as the chaos an d destruction which must precede the alchemical wor k, and which Jung understood as prerequisites for the forging of a unified Self. (5) Kellipot (\"Shells\" or \"Husks\") entrap the sparks of divine light, prevent them from serving their purpose in creation, and give rise to the negative realm known as the Sitra Achra or \"Other Side.\" According to t he Kabbalists, this evil realm is nevertheless part of the divine plenum and must be \"given its due\". The Kabbalistic notion of the \"Other Side\" has its Jungian equivalent in the arch etype of the Shadow. The Kabbalists regarded the Ot her Side as a necessary part of the divine plan and, like Jung, h eld that the individual¹s baser instincts must be i ntegrated into his or her being rather than rejected or repressed. We read in the Zohar: Mark this! As Job kept evil separate from good and failed to fuse them, he was judged accordingly; fir st he experienced good, then what was evil, then again go od. For man should be cognizant of both good and ev il, and turn evil itself into good. This is a deep tene t to faith.¹ (Sperling & Simon, 1931-34, Vol. 3, p. 109). Compare this Jung¹s assertion that \"A safe foundati on is found only when the instinctive premises of t he unconscious win the same respect as the views of th e conscious mind.\" (Jung, 1967, p. 48) (6) The separation of the \"King\" and \"Queen\" was un derstood by the Kabbalists to symbolize a split bet ween the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"masculine and feminine elements of the deity, which itself reflects the disorder and chaos of a broken world. For the Kabbalists, the disharmony of the world is reflecte d in a separation between male and female, and the world¹s restoration and repair is symbolized by a wedding b etween Tifereth and Malchuth, the masculine and fem inine Sefirot, known in the Kabbalah as the Holy One and his Bride. Jung, of course, interpreted these ideas psychologically, and saw them as symbols of the uni on between animus and anima which in the individual psyche is a pre-requisite for individuation and psychological growth. Jung explored the Kabbalistic symbols of t he divine marriage extensively (Jung, 1955-6/1963, pp. 23, 24 , 396, 432-445, esp. 442; Jung, 1973, Vol. 1, p. 35 6, Vol. 2, p. 292) and, as we shall see, himself had dreams and v isions which incorporated these Jewish ideas. (7) Tikkun Haolam (the Restoration of the World) is the process thro ugh which humanity repairs the world in the service of a \"second creation. According to the Lur ianists, one result of the Breaking of the Vessels is the depositing of a hidden divine spark in the soul of each indivi dual, and in the Kabbalistic (but not Gnostic) view , in the heart of all earthly things. For the Kabbalists, the purpose of Tikkun, the Restoration of the World, is for in dividuals to \"raise\" and redeem the sparks within both themselve s and the world, in order that both humankind and t he world can actualize their fullest, divine potential. Jung con sidered the theory of the \"sparks\" or \"scintillae\" as they appeared in Gnosticism, Kabbalah (Jung, 1955-6/1963, p. 301, n2 6) and alchemy and concluded that they represented an element of the primordial, archetypal unconscious i n man (Jung, 1955-6/1963, p. 491). Unfortunately, h e was apparently unaware of the development of the \"spark s\" symbol in later Kabbalah and Hasidism, where, in contrast to the Gnostic understanding of the sparks as a vehicl e for escape from the world and self (Jung, 1955-6/ 1963, p. 48, and p. 48, n55), they are understood as an opportun ity for the development of the person and the spiri tualization of the world. For the Hasidim, each individual is plac ed on earth because there are sparks both within hi s/her own soul and the world that only that individual can redeem. In raising the sparks, male and female are reunite d and creation is completed and perfected. (8) the Partzufim (Visages) are, understood by the Lurianists to be a plurality of archetypal personas through which the Primordial Man must evolve in the process of Ti kkun. For Jung, the notion of the raising of the sp arks and the entire process of Tikkun would have been ideal symb ols for individuation. That the process of Tikkun g ives rise to, and causes the Primordial Man to embody, archetypal personalities (the Holy Ancient One, the Father, t he Mother, the Impulsive Male, and the Female) each of which h as a role in Tikkun, and which clearly anticipate J ung¹s major archetypes is further proof of the fit between the Lurianic Kabbalah and the Jungian \"Self.\" Kabbalah, Gnosis and Jungian Psychology Regardless of the direction of influence it is clea r that nearly all of the basic symbols and ideas of Gnosticism are to be found in one form or another in the Kabbalah and vice versa. The notion of an unknowable infinite g odhead which contains within itself a coincidence of metap hysical opposites, the gradual manifestation of the Infinite through an emanation of logoi or Sefirot, the notio n of a cosmic accident giving birth to the manifest world, the distinction between the God of the Bible and the tr ue Infinite, the estrangement of humankind from its true essence, and the entrapment of a divine spark within the ind ividual¹s material nature, are all themes which fou nd their way into both Gnosticism and the Kabbalah. Yet for all the similarities between Gnostic and Ka bbalistic doctrine, certain essential differences e merge which are of ultimate significance for Jungian psychology. Th e major difference is that Gnosticism has no equiva lent concept or symbol for the Kabbalistic notion of Tikkun ha-O lam, the restoration of the world. As we have seen, for the Gnostics (as well as for Jung in the Septem Sermone s), the goal of spiritual life is not a restoration , but an escape from what they regard to be this worthless, evil wo rld. The Gnostic identifies with the divine spark w ithin the self in order to transcend the physical self and the materi al world. The Kabbalist holdsa radically different view. Although there are also escapist or \"Gnostic\" trends within the Kabbalah, the majority of Kabbalists held that the realizati on of the divine spark both in the person and the materia l world, brings about an elevation, restoration and spiritualization of the individual and the environment. In Gnosticis m the world is escaped, in the Kabbalah it is eleva ted and restored. The latter view is one that is much more congenial to Jungian psychology, not only on the ob vious principle that for Jung life in this world, and the world itself, is worthwhile, but also with respect to the (less obvious) psychological interpretation which Jung pl aces on the Gnostic myths. As Segal (1972) has poin ted out, the Gnostic ethic, as interpreted by Jung, would, stric tly speaking, lead to a complete identification of the subject with the unconscious mind. This is because the Gnostic a ttempts to escape from the world (which Jung equate s with the ego) into a complete identification with the infini te pleroma which, as we have seen, Jung identifies with the collective unconscious. By way of contrast, for the Kabbalists and Jung (an d the alchemists as interpreted by Jung) the godhea d creates the world and humankind in order to fully realize itsel f. By analogy the unconscious mind manifests itself in a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"conscious, reflective ego in order to complete and know itself as a \"Self.\" \"The difference\" Jung writ es, \"between the natural individuation process, which runs its c ourse unconsciously, and the one which is conscious ly realized is tremendous: in the first case consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginni ng\" (Jung, 1952/1969). For Jung and the alchemists, the world, and its psychological equivalent, the ego, far fro m being the superfluous, harmful and lamentable conditions envi sioned by the Gnostics, are actually necessary, ben eficial and l audable (Segal, 1992). Both God and humankind must pass through the world and redeem it in order to re alize their full essence. This is precisely the view of the Kab balists, as expressed in their symbol of tikkun hao lam. Gnosticism actually advocates the precise opposite of Jungian Psychology (Segal, 1992). Interestingly, the alchemists are far more compatib le with Jung (and the Kabbalah) on this crucial poi nt than are the Gnostics. The raison d¹être of alchemy is the trans formation of worldly matter (Segal, 1992) not the e scape from it. For Gnosticism, the dissolution of the world is an end in itself, for the alchemists it is a precondit ion for a new creation, just as in the Kabbalah the Shevirat ha-K elim, the breaking the vessels and destruction of e arlier worlds, sets the stage for the world¹s redemption in tikkun haolam. Jung is more Kabbalistic than Gnostic on a number o f other crucial points as well. For example, accord ing to the Gnostics, the demiurge or creator God, (the God arc hetype in Jung) is thoroughly evil, whereas for Jun g (and the Kabbalah) it represents both good and evil, persona and shadow, a coincidence of opposites. Quispel wr ites that the fundamentally Jungian interpretation, according to which the representation of God, and thus the godhe ad, encompasses both good and evil, has no analogy in t he Gnostic sources. It is not Gnostic at all. One c an call it magical, but only magic with a Jewish foundation (in Segal, 1992, p. 236) Indeed, Gnosticism preaches a radical dualism of go od immateriality and evil matter; while for Jung, a s for the Kabbalah, good and evil originate (and end) in the same source, are mutually dependent upon one anothe r and are not simply to be identified with spirit and matter. Had Jung been more familiar with the Kabbalah, par ticularly in its Lurianic form, he would have found a system of myth ical thought that was far more compatible with his own psychology than was Gnosticism. In 1954, shortly af ter his discovery of the Lurianic Kabbalah and afte r essentially completing Mysterium Coniunctionis, Jung all but ac knowledged this point of view. In a letter to James Kirsch (16 February 1954) he writes: The Jew has the advantage of having long since anti cipated the development of consciousness in his own spiritual history. By this I mean the Lurianic stag e of the Kabbalah, the breaking of the vessels and man's help in restoring them. Here the thought emerges fo r the first time that man must help God to repair t he damage wrought by creation. For the first time man' s cosmic responsibility is acknowledged (Jung, 1973 , Vol. 2, p. 155). For Jung, in contrast to the Gnostics, man is not e njoined to escape the world (and his conscious life within it) but is rather responsible for its repair and restoration. It is this notion of \"world-restoration\", what the Kabbalist¹s referred to as tikkun haolom, which most connects Jung to th e Jewish mystical tradition, and which clearly dist inguishes him from Gnosticism. Jung's Kabbalistic Vision Jung appears to have had a personal experience of t he Kabballah which went far beyond his scholarly in terests. In his Memories, Dreams and Reflections, Jung (1961) r ecords a series of visions which he describes as \"t he most tremendous things I have ever experienced\". The vis ions, which occurred in 1944 when Jung, nearing the end of his seventh decade, was stricken with a heart attack an d \"hung on the edge of death\" (p. 289), involve the divine wedding between Tifereth and Malchut, which, in the Kabbalah, are the masculine and feminine divine pr inciples. Jung describes these visions as occurring in a stat e of wakeful ecstasy, \"as though I were floating in space, as though I were safe in the womb of the universe\" (p. 293). He further describes his experience as one of indes cribable \"eternal bliss.\" He reports: Everything around me seemed enchanted. At this hour of the night the nurse brought me some food she ha d warmed... For a time it seemed to me that she was a n old Jewish woman, much older than she actually wa s, and that she was preparing ritual kosher dishes for me. When I looked at her, she seemed to have a blu e halo around her head. I myself was, so it seemed, i n the Pardes Rimmonim, the garden of pomegranates, and the wedding of Tifereth with Malchuth was takin g place. Or else I was Rabbi Simon ben Jochai, whos e wedding in the afterlife was being celebrated. It w as the mystic marriage as it appears in the Cabbali stic tradition. I cannot tell you how wonderful it was. I could only think continually, \"Now this is the ga rden of pomegranates! Now this is the marriage of Malchuth with Tifereth!\" I do not know exactly what part I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"played in it. At bottom it was I myself: I was the marriage. And my beatitude was that of a blissful wedding. (Jung, 1961, p. 294) Jung relates that the vision changed and there foll owed \"the Marriage of the Lamb\" in Jerusalem, with angels and light. \"I myself\", he tells us \"was the marriage of the lamb\". In a final image Jung finds himself in a classical amphitheater situated in a landscape of a verdant c hain of hills. \"Men and woman dancers came on-stage , and upon a flower-decked couch All- father Zeus consummated the mystic marriage, as it is described in the Iliad\" (p. 294). As a result of these experiences, Jung developed the i mpression that this life is but a \"segment of exist ence\". During the visions, past, present and future fused into one. A ccording to Jung, \"the visions and experiences were utterly real; there was nothing subjective about them\" (p. 295). It is remarkable that Jung, in what he describes as the most tremendous and \"individuating\" experience of his life, should find himself in the \"garden of pomegranates, \" an allusion to a Kabbalistic work of that name by Moses Cordovero, and should identify himself with the con iunctio of Tifereth and Malchuth as it is described in the Kabbalah. In this vision, which can only be describ ed as \"Kabbalistic,\" Jung further identifies himsel f with Rabbi Simon ben Yochai, who in Jewish tradition is regard ed as the author of the Zohar. Here, on the brink o f death, Jung has a mystical experience in which the truth of the Kabbalistic we dding is equated with the truth of the hierosgamos, the divine wedding in Greek mythology. The sexual u nion of male and female is mystically experienced a s the source of both immortality and personal indiv iduation and redemption. Jung tells us that such ex perience involves an \"objective cognition\" in which all emotional ties, \"relationships of desire, tainted by coercion and c onstraint\" are transcended in favor of a real coniunctio, a relati onship with oneself, others and the world which is beyond, yet also behind, desire. Only after this Kabbalistic experie nce was Jung able to compose the Mysterium Cioniunc tionis and other major works of his final years (Jung, 1961). Given Jung¹s familiarity with Kabbalistic ideas and symbols, the profoundly psychological nature of th e Kabbalah, and Jung¹s own Kabbalistic visions we might ask why he never developed the sustained inquiry into the Kabbalah as he did with regard to Gnosticism and, especially, a lchemy. There are several reasons for this. In the first place, as Jung himself notes, he did not know Hebrew and was unfamiliar with the relevant sources, most of which in his day had neither been translated nor even summarized int o languages with which Jung was familiar. More significantly, in spite of Jung¹s protestation s that he was neither metaphysician nor theologian, his major concern in his later works was a psychological revi vification of Christianity through a study of its u ndercurrents, Gnosticism and Alchemy, which he understood as the compensatory \"shadow\" to official religion. While J ung held that the Kabbalah played a similar role vis-a¹-vis orthodox Judaism, as a Christian this was of periph eral interest to him. True, there was a Christian Kabbalah (of which Knorr was an example), but for Jung, the Kabbalah was essentially Jewish in origin and import. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Jung maint ained a strong ambivalence towards Jews and Judaism , which, at least during a critical point in his career, may ha ve compromised his receptivity to Jewish ideas. Jung and Judaism As is well known, Jung was originally placed by Fre ud in the unenviable position of playing guarantor that psychoanalysis would not be looked upon as a \"Jewis h national affair.\" According to Jung, after the tw o parted ways, Freud accused him of anti-semitism because Ju ng could not abide with Freud¹s \"soulless materiali sm\" (Jung, 1973, Vol. 1, p. 162). The relationship with Freud appears to have colored Jung¹s view of Judaism, as Jung¹s later identification of psychoanalysis as a Jewish psycho logy inapplicable to Europeans appears to have in p art been fueled by his competitiveness with and personal ani mosity against Freud (McClynn, 1996; see Jung, 1934 /1970). Although the controversy regarding Jung¹s personal and professional stance with regard to the Nazis du ring the 1930s is beyond the scope of this discussion (see J affe, 1971 and McClynn, 1996), it is important to r ecall that during this period Jung expressed certain negative views about \"Jewish psychology.\" In the 1930s, duri ng the rise of Nazi anti-semitism, Jung chose to highlight what in his view were the differences between Jewish and G erman psychology (C.G. Jung, 1934/1970). His statements w ere understood by many to be anti-semitic and as pl aying directly into the hands of those who would view Jew s as a threat to, or parasites upon, Germany and ot her European states. Jung¹s observations that the \"Jewish race as a whol e...possesses an unconscious which can be compared with the \"Aryan\" only with reserve\", and that \"the Aryan unc onscious has a higher potential than the Jewish\" (J ung 1934/1970 p. 166) were seen as reinforcing Nazi ide ology (despite a context which could be understood as praising the Jewish mind in other respects). Further, in his polemic against Freud, Jung, as ear ly as 1928, wrote \"it is quite an unpardonable mistake to accept the conclusions of a Jewish psychology as generally valid\" (Jung, 1928/ 1966, p."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"148, n. 8, see also Jung 1934/1970, p.544). In a le tter to B. Cohen he later explicitly stated: \"In so far as his (Freud¹s) theory is based in certain respects on Je wish premises, it is not valid for non-Jews.\" (Jung , 1973, Vol. 1, p. 154) It was during the period of Jung¹s early, and perha ps greatest, involvement with alchemy that he chose to distance the Western/Christian psyche from Judaism. In 1935 Jung wrote to Neumann (who had written to Jung abou t Judaism) \"analytical psychology has its roots in th e Christian middle ages, and ultimately in Greek ph ilosophy, with the connecting link being alchemy\" (Jung, 1973, Vol . 1, p. 206). Given Jung¹s need in the 1930s to dis tinguish his Christian/Western psychology from the Jewish psycho logy of Freud, one wonders whether Jung underemphas ized the huge impact of Judaism (via the Kabbalah) on al chemy, and thereby upon his own thinking. It is not until after the war that Jung begins to make numerous reference s to the Kabbalah. His report, in the letter to Eva ns quoted above, to the effect that he only came across the m ajor doctrines of the Lurianic Kabbalah in 1954 is surprising given his long contact with Gershom Scholem at the Eranos conferences and the fact that Scholem¹s popu lar writings on this subject had already appeared in th e 1930s. I do not know for a fact that Jung suppressed the J ewish mystical origins of some of his ideas. Howeve r, given his polemic against Freud, his characterizations of the Jewish psyche, his desire to distinguish his psych ology from \"Jewish psychology\", and the situation in Europe du ring the 1930s, he had a powerful motive for doing so. If indeed Jung had consciously or unconsciously suppressed th e Jewish mystical sources of some of his ideas, his Kabbalistic visions during his apparently mortal illness in 194 4 can be understood (in Jungian terms) as a powerfu l compensation for that suppression, or more generall y, as an atonement for his anti-Jewish writings and sentiments. It is important to note that Jung¹s attitude toward Judaism, even in the 1930s, was by no means always pejorative. During that period Jung steadfastly defended himsel f against any accusations of anti-semitism and work ed to prevent Jewish psychotherapists from being pushed o ut of their profession. He defended his right to po int out the unique features of Jewish psychology, as he had don e, for example, with respect to the Indians and Chi nese, and insisted that his views on Jewish psychology long a ntedated the rise of National Socialism in Germany (Jung 1934/1970), though he seemed to forget his earlier (1928) view that on the deepest psychological level it is \"impossible to distinguish between an Aryan, Semiti c, Hamitic or Mongolian mentality, [as] all human r aces have a common collective psyche\" (Jung, 1928/1966, p. 149, n. 8). Even in his 1934 paper, Jung (1934/1970) he ld that the Jewish mind had a greater consciousness and was mor e differentiated than the Aryan, and, in a letter t o Roback, held that Jews have an extension into their own subconsc ious which is rare amongst non-Jews, (Jung, 1973, V ol. 1, p. 224). Further, Jung cogently observed that in spite of the fact that the so-called \"cultivated Jew\" is always on the way to becoming a \"non-Jew\" (Jung, 1973, Vol. 1, p 206), that No one who is a Jew can become a human b eing without knowing that he is a Jew, since this is the basi s from which he can reach out towards a higher huma nity.\" (p. 162). While it is clear that Jung regretted even the appe arance of having flirted with National Socialism (J affe, 1971; McClynn, 1996) he never, as far as I can tell, prov ided a full and satisfactory accounting of his earl ier views on Jewish psychology. His disciple and confidant, Anie la Jaffe (1971), later wrote that Jung¹s early stat ements about the Jewish mind \"spring from a lack of comprehensio n of Judaism and Jewish culture which is scarcely i ntelligible today\". In a letter to Jaffe, Gershom Scholem relat es that after the war Jung was confronted by the Je wish scholar Leo Baeck on these matters, and the two ultimately made peace after Jung¹s confession that he had \"sli pped up.\" This, Scholem relates, was sufficient for both Baec k and Scholem to, in effect, forgive Jung and conti nue their relationship. I am deeply troubled by Jung¹s apparent duplicity a nd opportunism with respect to what he himself term ed the \"Jewish question.\" However, none of the above consi derations should, in my opinion, prevent us from ei ther appreciating the affinities between the Kabbalah an d the position Jung eventually arrived at, nor in n oting the influence of Kabbalistic ideas both directly and in directly (through alchemy) on Jungian psychology. N or should these considerations prevent us from embarking on t he fascinating task of examining the vast Kabbalist ic literature which has come to light in the past 60 years from a Jungian perspective, and thereby enriching our und erstanding of both the Kabbalah and our own psyche. As I have attempted to show, Jung¹s relationship to the Kabbalah is multi textured, if somewhat unsett ling. The story of Jung and Jewish mysticism is one, I believe, tha t is only beginning to be told and understood. References Altizer, T. J. (1959). Science and Gnosis in Jung¹s psychology.
