The result of this is to be seen in the uneasiness that prevails everywhere. But humanity is waking up, slowly but surely and begin- ning to realize that it, itself, is the most precious thing on earth. The old-established statement that the individuals that make up the race are imperfect is no more true than that a pile of lumber is imperfect, that is to be afterward reformed or built into a house. As it is the carpenter's business to take the lumber, which is perfect as material, and build the house, so it is the legitimate work of spiritual man to take the perfect material everywhere present and build, by the perfect law of chemistry and mathematics, the perfected, har- monious human being, and with this material, employ the same law to build up society collectively. It is a well-known physiological fact that the blood is the basic material of which the human body is con- tinually builded. As is the blood, so is the body; as is the body, so is the brain; as is the brain, so is the quality of thought. As a man is builded, so thinks he. According to the views of students of modern al- [7]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Tbe Tree of Life chemy, the Bible both the Old and New Testaments are symbolical writings, based primarily upon this very process of body building. The word Alchemy really means Fleshology. It is derived from Chem, an ancient Egyptian word, meaning flesh. The word Egypt also means flesh, or anatomy. Alchemy, however, in its broader scope, means the science of solar rays. Gold may be traced to the Sun's rays. The word gold means solar essence. The transmutation of gold does not mean the process of making gold, but does mean the process of changing gold, solar rays, into all manner of materialized forms, vegetable, mineral, etc. The ancient alchem- ist studied the process of Nature in her operations from the volatile to the fixed, the fluid to the solid, the essence to the substance, or the abstract to the concrete, all of which may be summed up in the changing of spirit into matter. In reality, the alchem- ist did not try to do anything. He simply tried to search out nature's processes in order that he might comprehend her marvelous operations. To be sure, language was used that to us seems symbolical and often contradictory, but it was not so intended, nor so at all in reality. We speak in sym- bols. If a man is in delirium, caused by alcohol in his brain-cells, we say he has \"snakes in his boots.\" Of course, no one supposes that the words are to be taken literally. Yet if our civilization should be wiped out, and our literature translated after four or five thousand years, those who read our history might be puzzled to know what was meant by \"snakes in his boots.\" Again, it has been believed by most people that the words, \"transmutation of base metals into gold,\" used by alchemists, referred to making gold. But a careful study of the Hebrew Cosmogony, and the [8]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Wonders and Possibilities of the Human Body Kabala, will reveal the fact that the alchemist al- ways referred to solar rays when he used the word gold. \"Base metals,\" simply means matter, or basic. The dissolving, or disintegration of matter, the com- bustian of wood or coal, seemed as wonderful to these philosophers as the growth of wood or the formation of coal or stone. So, the transmutation of base metals into gold simply meant the process of changing the fixed into the volatile, or the demate- rialization of matter, either by heat or chemical process. It is believed by modern students of alchemy that the books of the Old and New Testaments are a col- lection of alchemical and astrological writings, deal- ing entirely with the wonderful operation of areial elements (Spirit) in the human body, so fearfully and wonderfully made. The same authority is given for the statements, \"Know ye not that your bodies are the temple of the living God\" and \"Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give ye rest.\" According to the method of reading the numerical value of letters by the Kabala, M and E figure B, when united. Our B is from the Hebrew Beth, meaning a house or temple the temple of the soul the body. Thus by coming into the realization that the body is really the Father's House, temple of God, the soul secures peace and contentment or rest. The human body is composed of perfect principles, gases, minerals, molecules, or atoms ; but these build- ers of flesh and bone are not always properly ad- justed. The planks or bricks used in building houses may be endlessly diversified in arrangement, and yet be perfect material. Solomon's temple is an allegory of man's temple the human organism. This house is built (always being built) \"without sound of saw or hammer.\" [9]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life The real Ego manifests in a house, beth, church, or temple i. e., Soul-of-Man's Temple. The solar (soular) plexus is the great central Sun or dynamo on which the Subconscious Mind (another name for God) operates and causes the concept of individual consciousness. The brain of man is the Son of God, the mediator (medium) between the central dynamo and the Cosmic Ocean of Space. Thus digestion or combustion of food, circulation of blood, inbreathing the breath of life (aerial ele- ments) , is carried on by the co-operation of the Holy Trinity; God, the solar plexus; the Son, the brain; and the Holy (whole) Spirit, or air. No wonder that the seers and alchemists of old declared that \"Your bodies are the temple of the living God\" and \"The kingdom of Heaven is within you.\" But man, blinded by selfishness, searches here and there, scours the heavens with his telescope, digs deep into earth, and dives into ocean's depths, in a vain search for the Elixir of Life that may be found between the soles of his feet and the crown of his head. Really our human body is a miracle of mech- anism. No work of man can compare with it in accuracy of its process and the simplicity of its laws. At maturity, the human skeleton contains about 165 bones, so delicately and perfectly adjusted that science has despaired of ever imitating it. The mus- cles are about 500 in number; length of alimentary canal, 32 feet; amount of blood in average adult, 30 pounds, or one-fifth the weight of the body; the heart is six inches in length and four inches in diameter, and beats seventy times per minute, 4200 times per hour, 100,800 per day, 36,720,000 per year. At each beat, two and one-half ounces of blood are thrown out of it, 175 ounces per minute, 656 pounds per hour, or about eight tons per day. [10]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Wonders and Possibilities of the Human Body All the blood in the body passes through the heart every three minutes; and during seventy years it lifts 270,000,000 tons of blood. The lungs contain about one gallon of air at their usual degree of inflation. We breathe, on an aver- age, 1200 breaths per hour; inhale 600 gallons of air, or 24,000 gallons daily. The aggregate surface of air-cells of the lungs ex- ceed 20,000 square inches, an area nearly equal to that of a room twelve feet square. The average weight of the brain of an adult is three pounds, eight ounces; the average female brain, two pounds, four ounces. The convolutions of a woman's brain cells and tissues are finer and more delicate in fibre and mechanism, which evidently accounts for the intuition of women. It would appear that the difference in the convolutions and fineness of tissue in brain matter is responsible for the degrees of consciousness called reason and intuition. The nerves are all connected with the brain di- rectly, or by the spinal marrow, but nerves receive their sustenance from the blood, and their motive power from the solar plexus dynamo. The nerves, together with the branches and minute ramifications, probably exceed ten millions in numbers. The skin is composed of three layers, and varies from one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch in thick- ness. The average area of skin is estimated to be about 2000 square inches. The atmospheric pres- sure, being fourteen pounds to the square inch, a per- son of medium size is subject to a pressure of 40,000 pounds. Each square inch of skin contains 3500 sweat tubes, or perspiratory pores (each of which may be likened to a little drain tile) one-fourth of an inch in length, making an aggregate length of the [ii]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life entire surface of the body 201,166 feet, or a tube for draining the body nearly forty miles in length. Our body takes in an average of five and a half pounds of food and drink each day, which amounts to one ton of solid and liquid nourishment annually, so that in seventy years a man eats and drinks 1000 times his own weight. There is not known in all the realms of architec- ture or mechanics one little device which is not found in the human organism. The pulley, the lever, the inclined plane, the hinge, the \"universal joint,\" tubes and trap-doors ; the scissors, grind-stone, whip, arch, girders, filters, valves, bellows, pump, camera, and Aeolian harp; and irrigation plant, telegraph and telephone systems all these and a hundred other devices which man thinks he has invented, but which have only been telegraphed to the brain from the Solar Plexus (cosmic centre) and crudely copied or manifested on the objective canvas. No arch ever made by man is as perfect as the arch formed by the upper ends of the two legs and the pelvis to support the weight of the trunk. No palace or cathedral ever built has been provided with such a perfect system of arches and girders. No waterway on earth is so complete, so commo- dious, or so populous as that wonderful river of life, the \"Stream of Blood.\" The violin, the trumpet, the harp, the grand organ, and all the other musical instruments, are mere counterfeits of the human voice. Man has tried in vain to duplicate the hinges of knee, elbow, fingers and toes, although they are a part of his own body. Another marvel of the human body is the self- regulation process by which nature keeps the temper- ature in health at 98 degrees. Whether in India, [12]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Wonders and Possibilities of the Human Body with the temperature at 130 degrees, or in the arctic regions, where the records show 120 degrees below the freezing point, the temperature of the body re- mains the same, practically steady at 98 degrees, despite the extreme to which it is subjected. It was said that \"all roads lead to Rome.\" Mod- ern science has discovered that all roads of real knowledge lead to the human body. The human body is an epitome of the universe; and when man turns the mighty searchings of reason and investiga- tion within that he has so long used without the New Heaven and Earth will appear. While it is true that flesh is made by a precipita- tion of blood, it is not true that blood is made from food. The inorganic or cell-salts contained in food are set free by the process of combustion or diges- tion, and carried into the circulation through the deli- cate absorbent tubes of the mucous membrance of stomach and intestines. Air, or Spirit, breathed into the lungs, enters the arteries (air carriers) and chem- ically unites with the mineral base, and by a wonder- ful transformation creates flesh, bone, hair, nails, and all the fluids of the body. On the rock (Peter or Petra, meaning stone) of the mineral salts is the human structure built, and the grave, stomach, or hell shall not prevail against it. The minerals in the body do not disintegrate or rot in the grave. The fats, albumen, fibrine, etc., that compose the organic part of food, are burned up in the process of digestion and transposed into energy or force to run the human battery. Blood is made from air ; thus all nations that dwell on earth are of one blood, for all breathe one air. The best food is the food that burns up quickest and easiest; that is, with the least friction in ths human furnace.

Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.\" \"Welcome every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean, not an inch, not a particle of an inch, is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.\" \"Divine am I, inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from.\" \"I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough; none has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough ; none has begun to think how divine he him- self is, and how certain the future is.\" The vagus nerve, so named because of its wander- ing (vagrant) branches, is the greatest marvel of the human organism. Grief depresses the circulation, through the vagus, a condition of malnutrition fol- lows, and tuberculosis, often of the hasty type, fol- lows. The roots of the vagus nerve are in the medulla oblongata, at the base of the small brain or cerebel- lum, and explains why death follows the severing of [14]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Wonders and Possibilities of the Human Body the medulla. It controls the heart action, and if a drug such as aconite be administered, even in small doses, its effect upon this nerve is shown in slowing the action of the heart and decreasing the blood pres- sure. In larger doses it paralyzes the ends of the vagus in the heart, so that the pulse becomes sud- denly very rapid and at the same time irregular. Branches of the vagus nerve reach the heart, lungs, stomach, liver and kidneys. Worry brings on kidney disease, but it is the vagus nerve, and especially that branch running to the kid- neys which under undue excitement or worry, or strain, brings about the paralysis of the kidneys in the performance of their functions. When we say that a man's heart sinks within him for fear or apprehension, it is shown by the effect of this nerve upon the heart action. If his heart beats high with hopes, or he sighs for relief, it is the vagus nerve that has conducted the mental state to the heart and accelerated its action or caused that spasmodic action of the lungs which we call a sigh.

Aviation, liquified air, deep breathing for physical development and the healing of divers diseases rule the day. In every brain there are dormant cells, waiting for the \"coming\" of the bridegroom, the vibration of the air age (the Christ) that will resur- rect them. Everywhere we have evidence of the awakening of dormant brain cells. Much, if not all, of spiritual phenomena, multiple personality, mental telepathy, and kindred manifestations, are explainable upon the hypothesis of the possibility of awakening and bring- ing into use of dormant brain cells.

In our waking moments our eyes are bombarded every minute by at least 600,000,000 vibrations. The ear is a colossal mystery, and the phenomenon of sound is a secret only recorded in the Holy of Holies of the Infinite Mind. And what is mind? We know absolutely nothing about it. Some believe that mind is the product of the chemical operation of matter, viz. : the atoms or materials that compose the human body. These persons contend that all electrons are particles of pure Intelligence and know what to do.

At last we have seen the \"Travail of the Soul and are satisfied.\" No more temples of the Magi now, but instead the Temple of the Ego, the glorious human Beth.

When he finds out what he really is, and how much he has always had to do in the making of himself what he is, he will be ready to grasp some idea of the wonderful possi- bilities of every human soul and body, and will know how completely and entirely is every man his own savior. Just so long as he denies his own powers, and looks outside of himself for salvation from pres- ent or future ills, he is indeed a lost creature. If the race is to be redeemed, it must come as the result of thought followed by action. If the race is to think differently than at present, it must have new bodies with new brains. Man must be born again. Modern physiologists know that our bodies are completely made over every year, by the throwing off of worn-out cells and the formation of new ones, that is going on every minute. Nature will take care of the making-over process, but we are responsible for the plan of reconstruction. Man must learn to run the machinery of his body with the same mathe- matical accuracy as he now displays in control of an engine or automobile, before he can lay claim to his divine heritage and proclaim himself master of his own.

And he has indeed assisted in creating manifesting all that is. Being a thought, an outbreathing of universal spirit, he is co-eternal with it. In material concept, we do not begin to realize the extent of our wisdom.

It is only a matter of time when all the necessities of life will be produced directly from the elements of the air. It is well known by chemists that all manner of fruits, grains and vegetables are produced directly from the elements in air, and not from soil.

This is a fact abundantly proved. Mr. Berthelot, a scientist of France, Tesla, the Aus- trian wizard, and our own Edison have long held that food can be produced by a synthetic process from its elements artificially. Some six or seven extracts, as well as coloring material, are now being manufactured in this man- ner. Madder is made almost exclusively by this process now. Sugar has recently been made in the laboratory from glycerin, which Professor Berthelot first made direct from synthetic alcohol. Commerce has now taken up the question; and an invention has been patented by which sugar is to be made upon a com- mercial scale, from two gases, at something like 1 cent per pound. M. Berthelot declares he has not the slightest doubt that sugar will eventually be man- ufactured on a large scale synthetically, and that the culture of sugar cane and beet root will be aband- oned, because they have ceased to pay. The chemical advantages promised by M. Berthe- lot to future generations are marvelous. He cites the case of alzarin, a compound whose synthetic man- ufacture by chemists has destroyed a great agricul- tural industry. It is the essential commercial prin- ciple of the madder root, which was once used in dye- ing. The chemists have now succeeded in making pure indigo direct from its elements, and it will soon be a commercial product. Then the indigo fields, like the madder fields, will be abandoned, industrial lab- oratories having usurped their place.

But air, in passing through the various avenues and complex structure of the human organism, changes, condenses, solidifies, until it is finally depos- ited as flesh and bone. From this established scien- tific truth, it appears that, by constructing a set of tubes, pumps, etc., resembling the circulatory system, as well as the lung cells of the human mechanism, which is a chemical laboratory, where the chemistry of spirit is ever at work, changing the one essence of spirit substance to blood, flesh and bone, air may be changed into an albuminous pabulum, which may be again changed into the special kind of food required by adding the proper flavor, which may also be pro- duced direct from the air. There does not seem to be any reason why this sub- stance, the basis of all food or vegetable growth, can- not, by proper process, be made into material for clothing. Wool, cotton, flax, silks, etc., are all pro- duced from the universal elements through the slow, laborious and costly process of animal or vegetable growth. Why not produce them direct? Those who believe in a time of peace on earth, a millennial reign, certainly do not think that our pres- ent mode of producing food will continue during that age. Slaughter of animals, and fruit, grain or vege- table raising leave small time for men and women to enjoy a condition foretold by all the seers and proph- ets.

The translation from the Hebrew text as given is crude and misleading. The real meaning in the original is, that the human embryo remains nine months in the female laboratory, thus falling short three months of completing a solar year, or soul year. Twelve represents a complete circle. The word sin comes from Schin, the 21st letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means to fall short of com- pleteness or understanding. In the Tarot symbol, S, or Sin, is represented by the \"Blind Fool,\" one lack- ing in wisdom. \"Brought forth in iniquity\" is merely a repetition of the words \"born in sin.\" Iniquity and inequity, or unequal, mean the same.

To acquire wisdom that will enable the Ego in flesh to build a bridge across the three-month gap, or space between the point of conception and birth, is the one real problem that confronts Soul on the material plane of expression. The alchemists, seers, and as- trolbgians of all ages have wrestled with this problem in their ceaseless endeavors to unravel the great mys- tery of man's dominion over flesh. Whether it be the chemist seeking new compounds, the physiologist searching and testing the fluids of the fearfully and wonderfully made body of man, or the alchemist probing for the Elixir of Life the Ichor of the Gods or the astrologian pulling and adjusting the etheric wires that criss-cross the spaces in an earnest desire to make good and sane the statement \"The wise man rules his stars,\" all, all are seeking to span the aw- ful space that yawns between the neophyte and the Promised Land of immortality in the body, where \"in my flesh I shall see God,\" and when and where he can truly say with the regenerated Job, \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.\" Man must work out his own salva- tion.

In so far as his circulatory sys- tem may receive these needed builders, health will be balanced and life prolonged. The chemical union of these cell-salts with organic matter, such as oil, fibrin, albumen, etc., forms the various tissues of the body, and administers to the physiological needs as represented by the Bridge, that the multiple cells may respond more harmoniously and completely to the magic touch of the # Divine en- ergy, just as the tones of a musical instrument are made the more melodious through a properly skilled manipulation.

This con- dition of air is liable to prevail whenever the tem- perature is above 70 degrees. One molecule of nat. sulph. has the power (chem- ical intelligence) to take up and carry away two mole- cules, or twice its bulk of water. The blood does not become overcharged with water from water taken into the stomach, but from the water lifted by expan- sion caused by heat above 70 degrees and held in the air and thus breathed into the arteries through the lungs. By the above we see that there is more work for this salt in hot weather than during cold weather. So-called malaria, Latin for bad air, is due to a lack of this tissue salt. Water lifted from swamps or clear streams or lakes by the action of the sun's heat is the same ; for heat does not evaporate and lift poisonous disintegrating organic matter from a swamp or marsh, but the water only. GEMINI : The Chloride of Potash, or Potassium. Synonyms: Potassium chloride, Kali Muriaticum, Kali Chloratum, Kali Chloridum, Potassi Chloridum. Formula: K Cl. This salt must not be confused with the chlorate of potash, a poison, chemical formula K Clo 3 . Chloride of potash may be obtained by neutraliz- ing pure aqueous hydrochloric acid with pure potas- sium carbonate or hydrate. The cell-salt kali muriaticum (Potassium chlo- ride) is the mineral worker of blood that forms fib- rin and properly diffuses it through the tissues of the body.

Em- bolus is a Latin word meaning little lump, or balls ; therefore to die of embolus, or \"heart failure\" gen- erally means that the heart's action was stopped by little lumps of fibrin clogging the auricles and ven- tricles of the heart. When the blood contains the proper amount of kali mur, fibrin is functional and the symptoms re- ferred to above do not manifest. CANCER : Fluoride of Lime. Synonyms : Calcaria Flurica, Calcium Fluoride. Chemical Formula : CaF 2 . This salt is formed by the union of lime and fluo- rine. The inorganic salts are the workers, controlled and directed by infinite intelligence, that performs the ceaseless miracle of creation or formation. Biologists and physiologists have searched long and patiently for a solution to the mystery of the dif- ferentiation of material forms.

No two forms of the different species of animals have the same combination of this \"rock foundation,\" but all have some of the same minerals. It is quite as important for a student of Biochem- istry to understand the process by which certain cell- salts operate to supply a deficiency as it is to know what a particular symptom calls for. Elastic fibre, the chief organic substance in rubber, is formed by a chemical union of the fluoride of lime with albumen, oil, etc. Therefore, we find this salt dominant in the elastic fibre of the body, in the enamel of teeth and connective tissue. A lack of salt in proper amount causes relaxed con- dition of muscular tissue, falling of the womb and varicose veins. Sometimes there is a non-functional combination of this salt with oil and albumen which forms a solid deposit, causing swelling of stony hard- ness ; it is a sort of incomplete fibre with other lime salts and vitiated fluids of the body. LEO : Phosphate of Magnesia. Synonyms : Magnesium Phosphorica. Formula : MgHOPOJ (H 2 O) . This cell-salt may be made by mixing Phosphate of Soda with Sulphate of Magnesia.

The white fibres of nerves and muscles need the dynamic action of Magnesia Phosphate especially to keep them in proper tune, or function, for by its chemical action on albumen the special fluid for white nerve or muscle fibre is formed. When the supply of this salt falls below the standard, cramps, sharp shooting pains or some spasmodic condition prevails. Such symptoms are simply calls of nature for more magnesia. The impulsive traits of Leo people are symboled In the pulse, which is a reflex of heart throbs. The phosphate of magnesia, in biochemic thera- peutics, is the remedy for all spasmodic impulsive symptoms.

The stomach and bowels burn food by chemical operation as truly as the furnace of a locomotive consumes by combustion. In the case of the locomotive the burn- ing of coal furnishes force which vibrates water and causes an expansion (rate of motion) that we name steam. The average area of skin is estimated to be about 2,000 square inches. The atmospheric pressure be- ing fourteen pounds to the square inch, a person of medium size is subject to a pressure of 40,000 pounds. Each square inch of skin contains 3500 sweat tubes or perspiratory pores (each of which may be likened to a little drain tile) one-fourth of an inch in length, making an aggregate length of the entire surface of the body 201,166 feet, or a tile draining for the body nearly forty miles in length. All tangible elements are the effects of certain rates of motion on the intangible and unseen ele- ments. Nitrogen gas is mineral in solution, or ulti- mate potency. Oil is made by the union of the sulphate of potas- sium (potash) with albuminoids and aerial elements. The first element that is disturbed in the organism of those born in the celestial sign Virgo is oil; this break in the function of oils shows a deficiency in potassium sulphate, known in pharmacy as kali sulph. Virgo is represented in the human body by the stomach and bowels, the laboratory in which food is consumed as fuel to set free the minerals, in order that they may enter the blood through the mucous membrane absorbents.

This alkaline cell-salt is made from bone ash or by neutralizing orthophosphoric acid with carbonate of sodium. Sodium, or natrum, phosphate holds the balance between acids and normal fluids of the human body. Acid is organic and can be chemically split into two or more elements, thus destroying the formula that makes the chemical rate of motion called acid. Acid conditions are not due to an excess of acid in the blood, bile or gastric fluids. Supply the alkaline salt sodium phosphate, and acid will chemically change to normal fluids. A certain amount of acid is necessary, and always present in the blood, nerve, stomach and liver fluids. The apparent excess of acid is nearly always due to a deficiency in the alkaline, salt. Acid, in alchemical lore, is represented as Satan (Saturn), while sodium phosphate symbolizes Christ (Venus). An absence of the Christ principle gives license to Satan to run riot in the Holy Temple. The Advent of Christ drives the thief out with a whip of thongs. Reference to temple in the figurative lan- guage of Bible and New Testament always symbols the human organism. \"Know ye not that your bodies are the Temple of the living God?\" Solomon's temple is an allegory of the physical body of man and woman. Soul of man's temple the house, church, Beth or temple made without sound of \"saw or hammer.\" Hate, envy, criticism, jealousy, competition, selfish- ness, war, suicide and murder are largely caused by acid conditions of the blood producing changes upon which Soul plays \"Divine Harmonies\" or \"fantastic [36]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Bridge of Life tricks before high heaven,\" according to the arrange- ment of chemical molecules in the wondrous labora- tory of the soul.

Synonyms: Calcium Sulphate, Calcarea Sulphate, Calc Sulphos, Gypsum, Plaster of Paris. Formula : CaSo 4 . This salt can be obtained by precipitating a solu- tion of chloride of lime with dilute sulphuric acid. SAGITTARIUS : The mineral or cell-salt of blood corresponding to Sagittarius is Silica. Synonyms: Silica, Silic, Oxide, White Pebble or Common Quartz. Chemical abbreviation, Si. Made by fusing crude silica with carbonate of soda; dissolve the residue, filter, and precipitate by hydrochloric acid. This product must be triturated as per biochemic process before using internally. This salt is the surgeon of the human organism. Silica is found in hair, skin, nails, periosteum, the membrane covering and protecting bone, the nerve sheath, called neurilemma, and a trace is found in bone tissue. The surgical qualities of silica lie in the fact that its particles are sharp cornered. A piece of quartz is a sample of the finer particles. Reduce silica to an inpalpable powder and the microscope reveals the fact that the molecules are still pointed and jag- ged like a large piece of quartz rock. In all cases where it becomes necessary that decaying organic matter be discharged from any part of the body by the process of suppuration, these sharp-pointed par- ticles are pushed by the marvellous intelligence that operates without ceasing, day and night, in the won- [37]"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life drous human Beth, and like a lancet cut a passage to the surface for the discharge of pus.

Arrow heads are composed of fiint, de- carbonized white pebble or quartz. Thus we see why silica is the special birth salt of all born in the Sagit- tarius sign. CAPICORN : Phosphate of Lime. Synonyms: Calcerea Phosphoricum, Calcium Phos- phate. Formula: Ca 3 Po 4 . Phosphoric acid dropped in lime water precipitates this salt. Circle means Sacrifice, according to the Cabala, the straight line bending to form a circle. Thus we find twelve zodiacal signs sacrificing to the sun. Twelve months sacrifice for a solar year. Twelve functions of man's body sacrifice for the temple, Beth, or \"Church of God\" the human house of flesh. Twelve minerals known as cell-salts sacrifice by operation and combining to build tissue. The dynamic force of these vitalized workmen constitutes the chemical affinities the positive and negative poles of mineral expression.

A combination of sodium and chlorine forms the mineral known as common salt. This mineral ab- sorbs water. The circulation or distribution of water in the human organism is due to the chemical action of the molecules of sodium chloride. Aquarius is known as \"The Water Bearer.\" So- dium chloride, known also as natrum muriaticum, is also a bearer of water, and chemically corresponds with the zodiacal angle of Aquarius. PISCES: Phosphate of Iron. Synonyms: Ferrum Phosphate, Ferri Phosphas. Formula: Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 . Phosphate of iron may be prepared by mixing so- dium phosphate with sulphate of iron. The salt pre- cipitated by this union is filtered, washed, dried and rubbed to a powder. The iron phosphate should not be used below the sixth (decimal trituration), as large doses of iron, as in tinctures, have a bad effect on the mucous lining of the stomach, injure the teeth and utterly fail to supply iron to the blood where it is needed to carry oxygen, the life giver. One red blood corpuscle does not exceed the one hundred and twenty millionth of a cubic inch. There are more than three million such cells in one drop of blood, and these cells carry the iron in the blood.

Thus we find the phosphate of iron molecularly deficient in all fevers and inflammatory symptoms. Health depends on a proper amount of iron phos- phate in the blood, for the molecules of this salt have chemical affinity for oxygen and carry it to all parts of the organism. When these oxygen carriers are deficient, the circulation is increased in order to con- duct a sufficient amount of oxygen to the extremities with the diminished quantity of iron, exactly as seven men must move faster to do the work of ten. This increased rate of motion of the blood is changed to heat, caused by friction, otherwise known as the \"conservation of energy.\" This heat, or increase in the temperature of blood, has been named fever, from the Latin word fervere, meaning \"To boil out.\" The writer fails to see any relevancy between the word fever and a deficiency in iron phosphate mole- cules in the blood. From Hippocrates to Koch you will not find a true definition of fever outside of the Biochemic theory. It is not simply the heat that causes distress in a fever patient, but it is the lack of oxygen in the blood due to a deficiency in iron, the carrier of oxygen. The feet are the foundation of the body. Iron is the foundation of blood. Most diseases of Pisces people commence with symptoms indicating a defici- ency of iron molecules in the blood; hence it is infer- red that those born between the dates of February 19 and March 21 use more iron than do those born in other signs. Iron is known as the magnetic mineral, due to the fact that it attracts oxygen. Pisces people possess great magnetic force \"in their hands and make the best magnetic healers.

It will now be made plain why the Masons and Catholics are not in agreement, for our letter N is an abbreviation of the 14th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, Nun, a fish. By adding N to Maso, the riddle of cooked or prepared fish was made so plain that the priest- hood strenuously objected, and thus developed fric- tion between the church and Masonry. The disciples were fishermen. The early Chris- tians used a fish as their secret symbol. Money to pay taxes was taken from the mouth of a fish. Bread and fish were increased until 12 baskets full were left, &c. God prepared a fish to swallow Jonah. Jonah means dove. Dove means peace the germ descending from the gray matter of the brain (See baptism of John). The storm means sex desire. The life seed was thus saved. \"He that is born of God cannot sin (or fall short of knowledge) for his seed (fish) remaineth in him.\" John. The age of puberty is about 12. Up to that age, a child does not understand moral responsibility. \"The first born\" means the first seed or fish. Pharaoh, sex desire, always tries to destroy the first born. When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, he went (at the age of 12) up the pneumo-gastric nerve, which crosses the medulla oblongata at its junction with the spinal cord at the head of the \"River of Jordan,\" the marrow or nerve fluid of the spinal cord (See illustration in Physiological Charts) and enters the cerebellum, the temple.

Nun is Hebrew for fish. Moses was the physical or generative fish. Moses' laws were on the physical plane. Joshua's laws were spiritual. Joshua means \"God of Salvation,\" and salvation comes from saliva or salivation. Sal is salt which Saves. \"If the salt loses its Savor\" i. e. Savior, wherewith shall it be salted?\" Saliva saves the body by digesting (or preparing) the food. Saliva is a smear or ointment, and so Joshua compares with Christ as Moses com- pares with Jesus.

But the question will be asked What or where is the source or origin of this seed or redeeming Son? We answer: Ether, Spirit or God. Names mean nothing. Esse, Universal intelligence, or It may be used. It breathes into man the breath of life. This elixir is carried through lungs into arteries, or air carriers, where it unites with the inorganic cell-salts, material- izes (cooked), and forms granules, and is then deposited as flesh and bone. The study of Astrology, Biology and Biochem- istry, added to Physiology, will lead one into the great Alchemical laboratory of the \"Fearfully and [47]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life wonderfully\" made human temple the temple made without sound of saw or hammer. Before the Neophyte can fully realize the power of the Optic Thalmus, the Divine Eye within his own brain, he must understand the meaning of Or espe- cially in its relation to Word and Jordan. Jordan (not Jordan) is the word in the original text. I is framed from lod the 10th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, and means \"hand,\" or that which creates. Or is gold, not metal, but the \"precious substance\" the seed. Dan is Hebrew for Judge, therefore the Creative Power, operating through the precious substance, produces Judgment, or the man of good judgment. The upper brain is the reservoir of this Or and is the gray matter or \"Precious Ointment\" of Christ. \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God/ All things were (or is) created by it,\" &c. The upper brain is the Word, and it furnishes all that man contains, or is. Jesus was not a Savior until he was Christed of lohn in the Jordan. Then he became the \"Beloved Son.\" Why was the baptism necessary? Because there are two fish. One was Jesus, the Carpenter, the man; the other, the Christed Jesus the Son of God. The Christ substance gave the electric or magnetic power to the seed to cross the nerves at Golgotha without disintegrating or dying. To crucify, means to add to or increase a thousand fold. When electric wires are crossed, they set on fire all inflammable substances near them. When the Christed seed crossed the nerve at Golgotha, the veil of the temple was rent and there was an earthquake, and the dead came forth, i. e. the generative cells of the body were quickened or regenerated. The crucifixion or crossing of the life seed gives [48]"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Optic Thalmus power to vibrate the pineal gland at a rate that causes the Optic Thalmus to fill the \"whole body with light,\" and send its vibration out along the optic nerve to the physical eye, and thus heal the blind. Let us hark back to the Nile : Pharaoh means a ruler or a tyrant or sex desire. Israel means blood, children of Israel, molecules of the blood. \"Moses lifted up the serpent,\" &c. Moses, the first born, the seed, desired to regenerate the blood and lead it to the promised land, thus he lifted up sex desire, here symboled as the serpent (See the temptation of the Adam and Eve.) ... So shall the \"Son of Man be lifted up,\" &c, &c. that is put on the cross in order to reach the pineal gland. 1 'If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me,\" I will draw all other seed unto me. Study the ety- mology of \"men.\" The tree in the midst of the garden bore fruit every month and its leaves were healing. The Commandment to not eat of the fruit of this tree was not (is not) heeded by the race, and death is the result. The serpent said \"Eat, thou shalt not die,\" but sex desire was a liar from the beginning. A noted Professor of Greek, in one of our Uni- versities, says that the translation of many New Test- ament texts from Greek are radically wrong. For instance, \"He that saveth his life, shall lose it, and he that loseth his life, for my sake, shall find it,\" should read: \"He that saveth his seed life shall loosen it (set it free), and he that loosens it, shall find it,\" which means that this \"Bread cast upon the waters\" shall redeem him. Galilee means a circle of water the fluids of the body. Jesus walking on the water is a symbol of the seed, or fish, on its journey. Peter, from petra [49]"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life (stone) is a symbol of physical or material thought which was rescued by the fish, Savior. The Optic Thalmus is called \"The Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world\" Sin is from the Hebrew letter Schin, meaning to fall short of knowledge. Sin does not mean wrong or crime, but one may commit a crime or do wrong through lack of knowledge. Paul said: \"I die daily\" . . . . \"I am the chief of sinners.\" Revela- tions: \"And the lamp thereof is the Lamb.\" The word, \"Lamb,\" ends with B, which means a house or body of some kind. Now, the optic, or central single eye, is a body, like the outer eye ball; therefore, a beth. This is called lamb by the ancient poet. Lamp ending with P, which means speech or sending forth or radiating, and is from Pe, the 8th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, and was used to express light, or knowledge, emanating or going forth from this eye or \"Lamb of God.\" \"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" The cerebellum is heart shaped, and in the Greek is known as the heart. The organ that divides blood was called the \"Dividing Pump.\" The seat of thought is the Cerebellum. Our thoughts shape our lives. If we think continually below the solar plexus in the Kingdom of the Earth; if we dwell in thoughts of material pleasures, we become animal and mate- rialistic. If we really desire the Kingdom of Heaven, we must think of the process that will enable us to realize it. When Jesus was born, they put him in \"swadling clothes.\" Now the psychic germ (fish) is composed of the concentrated essence of life, and is covered by a gossamer capsule for protection. If this swadling cloth is broken, the \"precious ointment\" is lost, i. e. it disintegrates and corrupts the blood. [50]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Optic Thalmus In order to save this germ of life, man must remember, that as a man thinketh, so is he. While men must abstain entirely from sexual contact, he must also realize that \"He who looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart\" By constant prayer do we attain the Kingdom. Envy, hatred, ambition, covetousness, will destroy the capsule that contains the seed, and thus corrupt the blood as surely as sexual contact. Alcohol in all its deceptive forms is the arch foe to this life-seed, and seeks by every means known to the enemy of man, to destroy it. \"No drunkard shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,\" because alcohol destroys the redeeming substance that enables man to understand or think in his heart the thoughts of the Spirit. Alco- hol cuts the capsule that holds the Esse, born every month in Bethlehem. Alcohol eats the fruit of the tree of life. Gluttony is another enemy to regeneration. All excess of food, all that is not burnt up in the furnace the stomach and intestinal tract all that is not properly digested ferments and produces acid which develops alcohol. Auto intoxication is common among those who overeat. Most every one overeats. The furnace, stomach and digestive tract, becomes a distillery, when the surplus food ferments ; and thus becomes Babylon, the home of unclean birds and beasts which pander to carnal mind. Here we have the reason why sickness was consid- ered Sin by the ancients: \"To heal the sick and cast out devils\" is the mission of the seed. \"He that is born of God cannot sin, or be sick, for his seed remaineth in him.\" \"The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin\"; therefore from all disease. [Si]"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life Here is the physiological explanation : When the Christed substance, the ointment from the river Jor- dan,, the oil in the spinal cord, reaches the pineal gland, it vibrates to a rate that causes new blood the new wine. This is the blood of Christ that heals all infirmities. Unless, so-called, Christians repent of their sins, the doom of the church is at hand; \"Mene, mene teckel upharsin\" is written on the wall. Here are the words that define a Christian: \"These signs shall follow those who believe; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. They shall cast out devils and raise the dead. All the things that I do, ye shall do, and greater things shall ye do.\" If there be one Christian on Earth today, let him stand forth and prove himself worthy. \"He that overcometh, I will give to eat of the fruit of the tree of life.\" To overcome a habit is to cease to do it. When the earthly man is controlled by the spiritual man the Lord God he ceases to eat of the fruit, that is, waste it. This fruit is then carried up to the brain and \"Eaten in the Father's Kingdom.\" \"And the last enemy to be overcome is death.\" We overcome death by ceasing to die, and in no other way. \"He that believeth in me, shall not perish.\" Those who die are sinners, and, therefore, are not Christians, for Christ Jesus was (is) without sin. \"The wages of Sin is death.\" \"Repent, forsake evil, take up thy Cross, call upon the Lord and He will abundantly pardon.\" \"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion.\" When the sexual functions are used for the propa- gation of human bodies, there is no condemnation or sin. Motherhood is holy, pure, divine. But motherhood forced, is crime. Unwilling mother- hood has created the spirit of war and murder and [52]"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Optic Thalmus has well nigh destroyed the race. Sexual union for pleasure alone is the broad road that leads to death. \"And there shall be no more Curse\" Revelation. The word \"Curse\" has no reference to an oath. Curse means friction, to grind. The statement, \"Then Peter began to curse and swear\" . . . And immediately the cock crew,\" when understood physiologically, fully explains the meaning of curse. Sexual commerce for the birth of children where the parents sacrifice themselves for their offsprings' sake, or total abstinence, is written with a pen of flame on all the pages of ancient Scriptures and modern biology. \"And I saw a woman clothed with the Sun, having the Moon under her feet and twelve stars upon her head.\" The Sun is the \"Son of Man,\" the product of her own body saved and lifted up. The Moon refers to the generative life. Twelve stars are the twelve functions, typified by twelve zodiacal signs, which she has mastered through physical regen- eration. Miss Ruth Le Prade, the woman poet of the New Time, sings of the Kingdom as follows : \"I am a woman free. My song Flows from my soul with pure and joyful strength. It shall be heard through all the noise of things A song of joy where songs of joy were not. My sister singers, singing in the past, Sang songs of melody but not of joy For woman's name was Sorrow, and the slave Is never joyful, tho he smiles. \"I am a woman free.

Let Ignorance and Tyranny Tremble at the sound of my feet. \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet and pray to thy Father in secret, and he shall reward thee openly.\" The word Secret is derived from Secretions. The upper brain, the Cerebrum, contains the secretions, gray matter, creative, or that creates, builds and sup- plies all life-force of the human temple. Soul of Man's (Solomon's temple).

Virgin, pure. Mar-y, or mare, water. Virgin Mary, pure water. Pure Sea. Pure Ether or spirit. Fish come out of the water. The water, or fluids, of the body give birth to the seed, or fish. The Virgin Mary is not mentioned in the Allegory after the ascension of the Christed Jesus the re- deemed fish. Each person, male or female, must \"work out their own salvation\" All so-called sex reform, that tolerates union of sexes, may be answered by : \"There is a way that Seemeth right to man The end of which is death.\" \"In my Kingdom there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, But they are as the Angels in Heaven.\" Eden, good dwelling place, and Promised Land, mean the same. The children, molecules, of Israel, blood, crossed the Jordan in order to reach Eden. Jordan is the spinal cord, and the pneumo-gastric nerve crosses, at the junction of this cord, with the body known as Medulla oblongata, and thus connects with the cerebellum, which is the anteroom or Eden the head the \"Thalmus\" or chamber that con- tains the \"Single Eye,\" the pineal gland and upper brain or cerebellum.

Pishon is the urine; Gihon is the intestinal tract; Hiddekel is the blood; Euphrates the nerve fluids, especially the creative. Abram and Sara, or Sarai, had the letter H added to their names when the angel appeared to them and gave instructions. See Gen. 16, 17 and 18. H is from Heth, the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means a field or a vision. The meaning of Heth (H) is given in the Jewish Kaballa and Tarot card symbols as \"Spiritual Perception\" field, or vision. Sarah gave birth to Isaac after this regeneration. Isaac means laughter, a symbol of happiness; so the story is a symbol of physical regeneration. The story of Job is evidently a fable. The letters I. O. B. (No J in Hebrew alphabet) figures up, numerically, 19, which means \"resplendent light.\" Regeneration develops the optic thalmus, or single eye, by furnishing the oil necessary to light the cham- ber or Eden. \"And the temple needs no light of Sun, Moon or Stars,\" &c. Job, on the generative plane, his experience in the Kingdom of Earth, suffered great trials, tribulations and disease; and while he argued much about God and kept his faith, he failed to comprehend. But after he became regenerated, he exclaimed: \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.\" Notice mine eye, not eyes. So here we have another proof that regeneration opens the Optic Thalmus the eye behind the eyes.

In the technical terms of modern chemistry and physiology, the above text is explained as follows : Sand and cement form rock or stone. Sand alone, without some medium cement is unstable, simply \"shifting sand.\" The Pineal gland, the dynamo that runs the organ- ism of man, is composed of sand plus a cement, an ointment, a smear, found, as has been explained, in large quantity in the spinal cord, also, to some extent, in all parts of the body. When this cement is wasted, as the Prodigal Son wasted his substance in riotous living, there being a deficiency of this precious oil, the pineal gland becomes brittle, and does not vibrate at a rate that vitalizes the blood and tissue at the health and strength rate, and the house, beth or body, falls. In the common slang of the hour, we say: \"He lacks the sand\" or \"grit.\" The mineral salts of blood were called sand or salt by Hebrews.

The mission of Jesus, the Christ, was to triumph over death and the grave, over matter, and trans- mute his body, and be able, also, to materialize at will. He not only succeeded in doing this, but stated most emphatically that all the things that he did, we may do also. Did he proclaim the truth? Answer thou of little faith! \"Rock of Ages cleft for me, Let me hide myself in thee.\" And the Christ Substance shall create the cement that completes the rock surface of the bridge that crosses the three-span gulf between the shores of conception and birth.
