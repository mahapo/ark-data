[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Notes on the Study of Early Kabbalah in English to which is appended KABBALAH STUDY: JEWISH MYSTICISM IN ENGLISH Don Karr The phase of Jewish mysticism conventionally referred to as “early Kabbalah” begins with Sefer ha-Bahir (ca. 1180) and ends with the Zohar (1270-1300). The major features and figures of this span can be outlined thus: 1 A. Early Kabbalah 1. Formative Period a. Sefer ha-Bahir (1180) b. Provence (ca. 1200) i. Isaac the Blind (d. 1235) ii. The Iyyun School (early to mid- 1200s) c. Gerona (ca 1200-1250) i. Ezra ben Solomon ii. Azriel iii. Nahmanides iv. Jacob ben Sheshet v. Sefer ha-Temunah vi. Sefer ha-Yashar d. Castile (active 1260-80) i. R. Jacob ha-Cohen ii. R Isaac ha-Cohen 2. Developmental Period a. Abraham Abulafia (1240-ca 1292) b. Joseph Gikatilla (1248-1325) c. Isaac of Acre, or Acco (1250-1340) d. Moses de Leon (1240-1305) __________ 1. This outline is offered with full awareness that it gives an oversimplified picture of the development of early Kabbalah.

Provence: Sefer ha-Bahir made its way to Provence where it fed the development of a mystical school, ca. 1200. This school’s second generation was headed by R. Isaac the Blind (d. 1235), “...the first Jewish scholar whom we know by name that dedicated all his creative powers to the field of Kabbalah” (Dan’s introduction to EK, p. 31). On Isaac the Blind see EK (pp. 31-4, translations on pp. 71-86), and OK (pp. 248-309). R. Isaac’s major work, Commentary on SEFER YEZIRAH , “the first systematic treatise of Kabbalah,” is fully analyzed and translated by Mark Brian Sendor in The Emergence of Provencal Kabbalah: Rabbi Isaac the Blind’s Commentary on SEFER YEZIRAH , Volumes I and II (Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge: Harvard University, 1994). Further, in Mystical Union, Individuality, and Individuation in Provencal and Catalonian Kabbalah (noted above), Yechiel Shalom Goldberg analyzes key passages from R. Isaac the Blind’s Commentary on SEFER YEZIRAH as well as from the works of R. Isaac’s nephew, R. Asher ben David, and R. Azriel of Gerona (see below). See CHAPTER ONE , “The Mystics of Provence,” in Israel Zinberg, A History of Jewish Literature, Volume III: THE STRUGGLE OF MYSTICISM AND TRADITION AGAINST PHILOSOPHICAL RATIONALISM (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1973) Also circulating in Provence in the early-to-mid 1200s were the writings of the Iyyun (Contemplation) school. The Kabbalah of these strange texts is quite different from the doctrines which developed into classical Kabbalah. See EK (p. 26, translations on pp. 43-56) and OK (pp. 309-363), and especially Mark Verman’s study, The Books of Contemplation: Medieval Jewish Mystical Sources (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), which includes translations of several major texts of this group.

Shimon Shokek argues for Rabbi Jonah Gerondi (13 th century) as the possible, if not probable, author. Some traditions attribute ShY to Rabbenu Tam from the end of the 14 th century.

Early beginnings a. Pseudepigrapha (ca. 200 BCE onward) b. Philo (ca. 20 BCE to 50 CE) c. Qumran (= Dead Sea Scrolls: 100 BCE onward) d. Rabbinic and synagogue trad itions (100 CE onward) e. Miscellaneous magic texts and other “occult” works 2. Merkabah and hekhalot (200 CE onward) 3. Sefer Yezirah (between 200 and 500 CE) 4. Transition a. Geonic period (600-1000) b. Early commentaries on Sefer Yezirah c. Religious philosophers i. Solomon ibn Gebirol (1020-1070) ii. Judah Halevi (1075-1141) iii. Abraham ibn Ezra (1089-1164) 5. Hasidei Ashkenaz (German Hasidism: ca 1170-1240) 1. Early beginnings Since Jewish mysticism is ultimately based on the Hebrew Bible, the beginning, really, is the Tanakh , parts of which are more “mystical” than others. More important to our line of inquiry is that certain themes were developed more than others for a variety of mystical purposes. By Talmudic times, two branches of the mysteries were well known and defined: the work of creation , i.e. developments of the first chapters of Genesis, and the work of the chariot , developments of Ezekiel and, to a lesser extent, Isaiah. a. Apocalyptic, Wisdom Literature, Pseudepigrapha Radicalizations of Bible themes appeared in the intertestamental apocalypses, which, when grouped together with a somewhat irregular splay of wisdom literature, psalms, testaments, prayers, and other material, are referred to as the pseudepigrapha . Two fine introductions to apocalyptic are 1. Russell, D.S. The Method and Message of Jewish Apocalyptic . Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1964. 2. Collins, John J. The Apocalyptic Imagination: An Introduction to the Jewish Matrix of Christianity . New York: Crossroad, Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1984; rpt. 1998. __________ 2. Refer to my “Kabbalah Study: Jewish Mysticism in English” (1996-8), appended below, where there is a section offering suggestions for a survey of Jewish mysticism, one segment of which parallels the outline presented here. Alternative titles are discussed. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Another strand begun in the Bible, including Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, and certain of the Psalms, is wisdom literature , which traces its way through the standard extra-canonical set called The Apocrypha (Ecclesiasticus), through the Pseudepigrapha, and on into the Talmudic Sayings of the Fathers ( Pirqe Aboth ). An enduring treatment of all this is O.S. Rankin’s Israel’s Wisdom Literature (Edinburgh: T&T Clark Ltd, 1936; rpt 1954 and 1964; rpt New York: Schocken Books, 1969.) A generous compendium of pseudepigrapha (which includes material which does not really belong under this heading) is The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha , edited by James H. Charlesworth: Volume 1: APOCALYPTIC AND TESTA- MENTS ; Volume 2: EXPANSIONS... LEGENDS, WISDOM... PRAYERS, ODES, PSALMS, FRAGMENTS (Garden City: Doubleday and Company, 1983 and 1985). It is a collection of utmost value—far more inclusive than the previous standard, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament , edited by R.H. Charles (2 vols., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1913). 3 The Charlesworth edition, however, does not include the Apocrypha. b. Philo Philo, who has a somewhat anticlimactic relationship with Jewish mysticism, was the most important Jewish philosopher of the first century. Thoroughly Hellenized, he begins for us the long, and rather strained, counterpoint between Neoplatonism and Judaism (and, indeed, Jewish mysticism) which simmers right on up to Spinoza and beyond. Of particular use in the present context are the following: On Philo: • Borgen, Peder. “Heavenly Ascent in Philo: An Examination of Selected Passages,” in The Pseudepigrapha and Early Biblical Interpretation , edited by J. Charlesworth and C. Evans (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1993). • Lewy, Hans (ed). “Philo: Selections,” in Three Jewish Philosophers (New York/Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society/Meridian Books, 1960). • Niehoff, Maren R. “What Is in a Name?

Rabbinic and synagogue traditions Bits and pieces of the “mystery” are scattered throughout the rabbinic writings following the themes mentioned ( creation and chariot ), along with others (angels and demons, mystical exegesis on various topics, etc.) Some material might be cast more into the category of “legend,” but here the allusions can often be suggestive and significant. It is difficult to pin down a few books to represent this phase of development; what with recent publications on midrashim and other rabbinic literature, a full list might have dozens of titles.

Geonic period It is generally thought that the Geonic period left little by way of evidence of theosophical development. Apocalyptic, merkabah , and rabbinic writings continued to exercise authority, this material being compiled and redacted with little being added to the existing traditions. In this period, however, magical works circulated and grew. Joseph Dan writes, “The Geonic period, from the sixth to tenth centuries, is a period which seems to be outside the realm of the history of Jewish thought. ... [I]t st ill retains the image of being a half-millennium almost completely devoid of any Hebrew works on theology or ethics. This image is not completely true.” 5 See Klaus Herrmann, “Jewish Mysticism in the Geonic Period: The Prayer of Rav Hamnuna Sava,” in Jewish Studies between the Disciplines:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Papers in Honor of Peter Schafer on the Occasion of his Sixtieth Birthday (Leiden–Boston: Brill, 2003).

Religious philosophers 6 A History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy by Isaac Husik (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1916; rpt. 1941) is considered a classic, but Husik grants only perfunctory mention to Kabbalah in the opening strains of his conclusion. A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages by Colette Sirat (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) serves our purpose better, for it pays some attention to how Kabbalah fits in. See also Elliot R. Wolfson, “Jewish Mysticism: A Philosophical Overview,” in History of Jewish Philosophy edited by Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman (London – New York: Routledge, 1997), and Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, “Philosophy and Kabbalah: 1200-1600,” in The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003). Ernst Muller, in History of Jewish Mysticism (Oxford: East and West Library, 1946; rpt. New York: Yesod Publishers, n.d.), writes (pp. 73-74): In Spain the Cabbalah assumed a more philosophical form, due to the influence of the religious philosophy which was already fully developed in that country. There are numerous points of contact between it and the work of the three great thinkers Jehudah Halevi, Solomon Ibn Gabirol, and Abraham Ibn Ezra. The first-named devoted some space to the Sefer Yezirah in his great work Cuzari . Gabirol as a neo- Platonist has many resemblances with the Cabbalah. ...

The ‘Unique Cherub’ Circle (Tuebingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1999), page 17. 6. According to Abraham Abulafia, Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed is a profound mystical text. Be that as it may, Maimonides is not generally ranked among those who contributed to the development of the Kabbalah. Nonetheless, he is considered esoteric —perhaps a euphemism for elite . See James Arthur Diamond’s Maimonides and the Hermeneutics of Concealment, Deciphering Scripture and Midrash in THE GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002), and Marvin Fox’s excellent Interpreting Maimonides (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990).

"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Kabbalah Study Jewish Mysticism in English by Don Karr A. In an article reviewing the then-current (1970s) state of scholarship on the history of early rabbinic Judaism, 1 Jacob Neusner complained, in particular, about E. E. Urbach’s study 2 concerning “ the sages, their concepts and beliefs” (Neusner’s italics) as revealing “remarkably little variation, development or even movement,” where “[d]ifferentiation among the stages” and “among schools and circles within a given period” was all but neglected. More recently, s imilar complaints have been leveled against “establishment” historians of Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah: In the last fifteen-or-so years, the neat linear history offered by Gershom Scholem 3 and those following his lead has been seriously challenged. In the proceedings of a conference marking the fiftieth year since the publication of Scholem’s landmark book, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941), 4 Ithamar Gruenwald argues 5 that this work (i.e., Major Trends... ) “appears to be too limited in its conceptual framework, as well as in its actual treatment of the subject matter.” Scholem saw certain developments in antique Judaism as a mystical phase which followed well after the writing of the Hebrew Bible; he also saw expressions of mysticism, once present, as separate and distinct not just from the scriptural phase but from normal (common or popular) expressions of religion. Gruenwald makes a case for tracing “mystical, or quasi-mystical, elements in Scripture itself.” Further, he states that there are mystical elements in rabbinic literature to which Scholem did not give due attention. Critical analyses focusing on Scholem’s treatment of ancient Jewish mysticism (i.e. merkabah mysticism and hekhalot literature) have also been offered in recent years. 6 For the moment, our concern is with those developments which, by one rationale or another, © Don Karr, 1993-1996.

Our approach may at first appear to be at cross purposes, for, while there is a case supporting a definition for Kabbalah which is more inclusive (as in Gruenwald’s comments noted above or in the suggestions in Moshe Idel’s article noted below), there are those of us who would like to see Kabbalah circumscribed sufficiently to salvage it from the excessive, near-generic use of the term, primarily in Christian and occult circles, to refer to mysticism and magic of all sorts. (The term kabbalah is itself a coinage 7 with problems not unlike those of related words as “mysticism,” “magic,” “myth,” and “gnosis/gnosticism.”) 8 The issue of defining—or redefining—Kabbalah has been addressed by Moshe Idel. 9 He critiques the “prevailing assumption in the academic field” that Kabbalah is “a relatively homogeneous mystical phenomenon, more theoretical than practical.” Idel’s primary target is, of course, Scholem and his notion that Kabbalah is defined, and thus unified, by a certain “core question,” namely, the mystery of the Godhead—which question is “answered” by the doctrine of the sefirot . Idel discusses the various mystical uses of divine names as an alternative kabbalistic channel. In the introduction to Essential Papers on Kabbalah , Lawrence Fine attempts to set up a working definition for kabbalah starting with a rejection of the “popular, noncritical use of the term” as referring to all “esoteric and occult phenomena, past and present.” 10 Fine prefers to limit Kabbalah to “a discrete body of literature that b ecame clearly identifiable beginning in Provence in the late twelfth century and northern Spain in the thirteenth.” However, in a book which has heated up the discussion on the origins of Kabbalah (and other topics), Moshe Idel has argued that there is not such a definite separation between rabbinic literature and the conventionally circumscribed Kabbalah. Idel’s view suggests a more continuous, less neat development which gradually coalesced into a proto- Kabbalah. 11 The medieval Jewish mystics referred to as “Kabbalists” did not abandon the mysticism—or any other part of the vast rabbinic literature—which came before them. The hekhalot writings, German hasidic material, Sefer Yezirah and the various commentaries on it, etc., along with the Talmud, midrashim , and the rest of the rabbinic writings, were all considered authoritative—all part of the same chain of tradition ( kabbalah ) of which the medieval and later Kabbalists considered themselves links. 12 Kabbalah did not spring up ex nihilo . It seems prudent to open channels for the origins and growth of Kabbalah back into the depths of ancient Judaism. Determining a starting line at Sefer ha-Bahir and the mystic circles at Languedoc does not match the facts. To begin with, the Bahir is itself a compilation, with sources and references to earlier material, which immediately begins our search into the time before its appearance. 13 "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"B. To investigate Jewish mysticism, how is one to begin at the beginning? The documentary evidence is sprawling, yet incomplete. We cannot commence with Genesis 1:1 and travel a nice straight line to Kabbalah today . However, to set a broad stage for subsequent mystical endeavor, a fine first book is Cosmos, Chaos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith , by Norman Cohn (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), the second part of which charts the primal swirlings of the path which eventually leads to Jewish (and Christian) mysticism, beginning with Zoroastrian concepts, tracing their development in Jewish apocalyptic, finally landing in the Book of Revelation. This last turn may seem to veer off track unless one keeps in mind the fundamentally Jewish character of this mystical apocalypse. For grounding in the theme (the ascension to heaven) taken up by the ancient Jewish mystics associated with the merkabah and hekhalot , a most informative source is Martha Himmelfarb’s Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (New York/ Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993). On a somewhat different tack, though holding onto the thread begun with the last two selections, is Markus N.A. Bockmuehl’s Revelation and Mystery in Ancient Judaism and Pauline Christianity [ WISSENSCHAFT- LICHE UNTERSUCHUNGEN ZUM NEUEN TESTAMENT – 2. Reihe 36] (Tuebingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1990) 14 Assuming that the reader is reasonably familiar with the Hebrew Bible, the next step would be to acquire some knowledge of early rabbinic thought and method. The Sages by E. E. Urbach (see note 2) is an excellent start. Three anthologies serve as introductions to their respective texts: 1. The Classical Midrash: Tannaitic Commentaries on the Bible , translated and introduced with commentary by Reuven Hammer. Mahwah: Paulist Press, 1995. 2. The Mishnah: Oral Traditions of Judaism , selected and translated by Eugene Lipman. New York: Schocken Books, 1974. 15 3. The Talmud: Selected Writings , translated by Ben Zion Bokser. Paulist Press, 1989. As a first approach to Jewish mysticism proper, an indispensable source is The Ancient Jewish Mysticism by Joseph Dan (Tel Aviv: MOD [Ministry of Defense] Books, 1993). At this juncture, it would be a good idea to read some of the more general books on Jewish mysticism in order to get an impression of its history and concepts. My re- commendation is to study the following books—in the order in which they are listed: 1. Scholem’s Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (see note 3), some comments on which have already been noted 16 2. Moshe Idel’s Kabbalah: New Perspectives . New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988. 3. Elliot R. Wolfson’s Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism . Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A weakness of Major Trends is the absence of a chapter on the early Kabbalah. Two books nicely fill this void: 1. Scholem’s Origins of the Kabbalah . Jewish Publication Society and Princeton University Press, 1987. 2. Joseph Dan and Ronald C. Kiener. The Early Kabbalah . Paulist Press, 1986. Paulist Press has provided two more titles which help round out our short list: 1. Daniel C. Matt. Zohar: The Book of Enlightenment (1983) 2. Lawrence Fine. Safed Spirituality: Rules of Mystical Piety, The Beginning of Wisdom (1984). The final development of Jewish mysticism covered in Scholem’s Major Trends is Hasidism, on which I have not developed an extended bibliography. However, I can suggest three works to provide a foundation: 1. Rachel Elior. The Paradoxical Ascent to God: The Kabbalistic Theosophy of Habad Hasidism . Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. 2. Moshe Idel. Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic . State University of New York Press, 1995. 3. Rivka Schatz-Uffenheimer. Hasidism as Mysticism. Quietistic Elements in Eighteenth-Century Hasidic Thought . Princeton/ Jerusalem: Princeton University Press and Magnes Press, 1983. Three of the books listed above (Dan and Kiener’s Early Kabbalah , Matt’s Zohar , and Fine’s Safed Spirituality ) offer texts as well as introductions. There are some other anthologies: 1. Daniel C. Matt. The Essential Kabbalah (see note 3). 2. Dan Cohn-Sherbock. Jewish Mysticism: An Anthology . Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1995. 3. Ben Zion Bokser. The Jewish Mystical Tradition . New York: The Pilgrim Press, 1981. 4. David Meltzer (ed). The Secret Garden. An Anthology in the Kabbalah . New York: The Seabury Press, 1976; rpt. Barrytown Ltd., 1998. 18 There is a bit of redundancy among these titles; fortunately, all are available in low-cost paperback editions. There are some collections of articles which can be recommended: 1. Lawrence Fine (ed). Essential Papers on Kabbalah. New York University Press, 1995. 2. Arthur Green (ed). Jewish Spirituality : volume 1: FROM THE BIBLE THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGES , 1986; volume 2: FROM THE SIXTEENTH-CENTURY REVIVAL TO THE PRESENT , New York: Crossroad Publishing Company, 1987. Haredi students of the Kabbalah might sneer at many of the works suggested here. For an overview, they would instead urge Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan’s Inner Space: Introduction to Kabbalah, Meditation and Prophecy (Brooklyn: Moznaim Publishing Corporation, 1990)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"or Rabbi Yechiel Bar-Lev’s Song of the Soul (Petach Tikva, 1994). Both, especially the latter, are serviceable introductions to Lurianic Kabbalah, which is somewhat thinly handled in our entry on Safed Kabbalah, though covered well in Scholem’s Major Trends . For further advice on readings in Judaism, see Back to the Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts , edited by Barry Holtz (New York: Summit Books, 1984). There, one is guided by specialists through the issues and literature of the Bible, Talmud, Midrash, medieval commentaries and philosophy, kabbalistic texts, hasidic teachings and prayer books. Another good overview of the literature of Judaism is The Sacred Books of the Jews by Harry Gersh (New York: Stein and Day, 1968). One of the best general anthologies is Philip S. Alexander’s Textual Sources for the Study of Judaism (Totowa: Manchester University Books/Barnes and Noble Books, 1984; rpt. University of Chicago Press, 1990). Alexander’s introductions are particularly helpful. A very instructive set of anthologies (if you can get past the lame illustrations) is Louis Jacobs’ CHAIN OF TRADITION SERIES published by Behrman House (New York): 1. Jewish Law (1968) 2. Jewish Ethics, Philosophy and Mysticism (1969) 3. Jewish Thought Today (1970) To these could be added Jacobs’ Jewish Mystical Testimonies (New York: Schocken Books, 1977).

XIII] (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1995). An essay which takes a critical look at contemporary “Kabbalah Studies” in general, but with a rather different approach from that of the present discussion, is Gil Anidjar’s “Jewish Mysticism Alterable and Unalterable: On Orienting Kabbalah Studies and the ‘Zohar of Christian Spain,’” in Jewish Social Studies , vol. 3, no. 1 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, Fall 1996). Regarding Anidjar’s central theme, namely Moslem influence on Kabbalah, see Moshe Idel’s leveling response, “Orienting, Orientalizing or Disorienting the Study of Kabbalah: ‘An Almost Absolutely Unique’ Case of Occidentalism,” in Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts 2 (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 1997). In several of Schaefer’s discussions ( Gershom Scholem Reconsidered for one) and in David Halperin’s The Faces of the Chariot (Tuebingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck] 1988), questions are raised about the titles and contents of hekhalot texts. The notion of fixed bodies of content forming a canon of “books” representing a coherent school of hekhalot mysticism appears unsupportable. A similar problem exists with the very term kabbalah (see note 7). A partial solution is suggested in such subheadings as the early Kabbalah of the Provence and Gerona circles, the ’Iyyun school, prophetic Kabbalah (of Abraham Abulafia), or Lurianic Kabbalah. However, should the German Hasidism be excluded so definitely from Kabbalah? 7. Until the thirteenth century, kabbalah referred to the whole body of oral religious teachings: the Talmud, the midrashim , etc. Indeed, anyone who picked up a copy of Sefer ha-Kabbalah (Book of Tradition) expecting it to expound upon kabbalistic mysteries would be sorely disappointed. See The Book of Tradition , translated by Gerson D. Cohen (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1968). 8. On the terms “mysticism,” “symbol,” and “myth,” see Gil Anidjar’s article, mentioned in note 6. Words causing particular difficulty in the field of Jewish mysticism are “gnostic” and “gnosticism”; examples of discussions on these terms are • P.S.

If one were to pick up any of a number of popular books on Kabbalah, one might come away with the impression that Kabbalah was primarily, if not solely, the doctrine of the sefirot , or divine emanations. In fact, Kabbalah involves a rich array of concepts and techniques, not the least of which are various types of letter and name mysticism (though many of the hermeneutic conventions concerning words and letters, such as gematria , are more accurately considered rabbinic, not kabbalistic). Topics are diverse: the progression of cosmic cycles, mystical explanations of the mitzvot , the interplay of humankind with the ultimate God, the source and reason behind evil, creation and the end, the mystical significance of the holidays, angels and demons, the transmigration of souls—indeed, a ranging literature full of unpredictable interpretations of scripture. 11.
