follows is essentiall y an extended meditation on the kabbalistic Tree of Life mandal a . During the meditation a new vision of the Tree of Life is formulated. Perhaps paradoxical ly, this new vision is derived from information encoded in several well- known ancient tradition al sources: The Book of Creation (Sefer Berashit) 1 , The Book of Formation (Sefer Yetzirah) 2 , The Book of Concealed Mystery (Sefer Dtzenioutha), The Greater Holy Assembly (Ha Idra Rabba Qadisha), and The Lesser Holy Assembly (Ha Idra Zuta Qadisha) 3 . There appears to be a common thread running through all of these classic texts. Formation of the Tree of Life seeks W 1 The first book of the Pentateuch. It's called the Book of Genesis in the English Bible. “ Berashit ” literally translates as “ in the beginning ”. All quotes used in this book are from the King James v ersion and highlighted in blue. 2 The Sefer Yetzirah is of unknown origin, but is consid ered to be ancient. It is one of the most revered books of the Kabb alah. All Sefer Yetzira h quotes used in this book are taken from Aryeh Kaplan's translation of the GRA version. See: Sefer Yetzira h , by Aryeh Kaplan. Weiser, 1990. Quotes are highlighted in yellow and can be identified by the abbreviation: SY. 3 These last three books belong to the larger work known as the Zohar . Quotes us ed in this book are from the Soncino Edition, and from Mathers' translation of Knorr von Rosenroth's Latin version. See: The Kabba lah Unveiled , by S. L. MacGreg or Mathers. Weiser, 1968. Quotes from the Zohar are highlighted in grey and can be identified by the abbreviations: BCM, GHA, and LHA. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life to follow that thread and by means of it to unify (to a certain extent) the knowledge contained in those fi ve ancient books. This book is filled with hypothese s and speculati ons. I had origina lly planned to make it simply a picture book without any accompanying commentary, but I was asked by a friend: What is my personal interpretation of this series of Tree diagrams? So I decided to include my own interpretations, along with the diagrams, for those who might be interested. The diagrams however, can be usefully studied without reading my commentary at all. In fact, you will probably discover levels of meaning that I have altogeth er missed as you peruse them. Essentially, this book is meant to be a visual meditation on the Tree of Life mandal a , and should be treated as such . If you are already well-versed in the Kabbalah and familiar with the Tree of Life diagram, then as you delve into these pages it is probable that my new arrangement of the twenty-two Hebrew letter pathways will challenge your existing preconceptions about the Tree of Life. You may even think to yourself: “Not another path arrangement! ” Read on however, and you will soon realise that these placements are by no means arbitrary or superficial. On the contrary, there is a definite and profound reason and purpose for each and every placement. In fact, I think you will be surprised at the amazing simplicity and 'obviousnes s' of the scheme's basic metaphysical premise. The formula is, in fact, so simple and so obvious that once you have grasped it there is no need to memorise the Hebrew letter pathway correspondences. Knowing the formula you can easily determine the Hebrew letter attribution of any Tree of Life pathway merely by applying it to the Tree diagram. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life The kabbalistic Tree of Life diagram consist s of thirty- two organised and interdependent components. Its structure defines the basic metaphysical architecture that underlies, supports, and sustains the universe and everything in it. Kabbalists throughout the ages have put forward many and various configurations of the ten sefirot and their twenty- two interconnecting pathways, and there have b een many proposed arrangements of the twenty-two Hebrew letters upon the pathways. What I am presenting here is a new configuration. This new arrangement differs considerably to previous versions because it reveals very plainly the fundamental dynamics operating within the kabbalistic Tree of Life, and it demonstrates in a step-by-step process how the Tree unfolds into manifestation. In all my writings I have never sought to appeal to kabbalists of the orthodox variety. My work is an exploration into new kabbalistic realms and possibilities. These new ideas have been received by me after years of studying the existing foundation of kabbalistic thought (and other metaphysical knowledge systems). Thus, although this book builds on the past it also offers some alternat ive interpretations of various primary source texts, and challenges some long- held present-day as sumptions. In bygone days tradition al commentators of the Kabbalah tended to distribute the Hebrew letters amongst the pathways so that the three Mother letters were given to three horizontal paths, the seven Double letters were assigned to seven vertical paths, and the twelve Simple letters were attributed to twelve diagona l pathways. (For example, see Diagram 1.) That may be a valid geometric 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life arrangement, but I have not yet found any deeper metaphysical explanation for those placements. The premise for the geometric arrangement is based on a particula r way of interpreting the Sefer Yetzirah , but nowhere in the 14 Diagram 1 : Tree of Life ( One of many va riations )"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life Sefer Yetzirah is it explicitly stated that the three Mother letters are assigned to three horizontal pathways, or that the seven Double letters are assigned to s even v ertical pathways. In Aryeh Kaplan's translation of the Sefer Yetzirah the twelve Simple letters are described as ... Twelve Elementals: h w z ' ' , x j y ' ' , l n ' ' o , e u q ' ' . Their foundation is the twelve diagonal boundaries [ GBVLY ALKSVN, Nwokla ylwbg ]... [From: S Y, 5:2] The Hebrew phrase “ g'vulei alakson ” is somewhat ambiguous. The preferred translation of Saadia ben Joseph is “ limit of the angles ” 4 . Kaplan's translation “ diagonal boundaries ” certainly does not accurately describe the twelve diagon al pathways of the Tree of Life diagram. Yes they are sloping (or 'diagonal'), but in what sense are they “ boundaries ”? 5 The Hebrew word “ alakson ” actuall y refers to the side of a triangle 6 – a concept that (as you will see) resonates quite nicely with my new path arrangement. In this new arrangement, every Simple letter pathway forms one side of a triangle whose other two sides are also occupied by Simple letters. Hence , it can be said that all the Simple letters are “ diagonal boundaries ” (or 'sides') of Simple letter triangles. 4 Saadia ben Joseph (al-Fayyumi). Commentaire sur le Séfer Yesira ou Livre de la Création par Le Gaon Saadya de Fayyoum , trans. & ed., M. Lambert, Paris, Emile Bouillon, Editeur, 1891); translated into English from the French & Hebrew by Scott Thompson and Dominique Marson, San Francisco, 1 985. 5 Of course, the well-kn own 'cube of space' provides one explanation, but the Tree of Life can also be shown to fulfill the “ diagonal bounda ry ” requirem ent. 6 According to the mathematicia n C. P. Benton it specifically refers to the longest side of a triangle. See: An Introduction to the Sefer Yetzirah , by Christopher P. Benton. Published in: The Maqom Journal for Studies in Rabbini c Literatu re , Vol VII, Winter 2004. My feeling though, is that the author o f the Sefer Yetzira h is being mor e general and is ref erring to any side of a triangle. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life As you may know, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alefbet are much more than simply elements of language. They symbolise the twenty- two primordia l archetypes (or fundamental ideas) that are the 'building- blocks' of Creation. In chapter one of the Sefer Berashit , the Creator is described as manifesting His 7 Creation through speech. In other words , He combines and sounds forth the twenty- two archetypes (in the pattern of the Tree of Life) and in so doing bring s the universe into being. In its commentary on the Sefer Berashit the Zohar reminds us that the Creation is built upon the twenty- two universal archetypes: He [the Creator] enfolded Himself in a covering of a supernal radiance of thought and created therefrom a world. He produced from the light of that supernal radiance mighty cedars of the up per world, and placed His chariot on twenty- two graven letters which were carved into ten utterances and infixed there. [Soncino Zohar. Vol I, pg. 111. Bereshith 29a.] [Bracketed text is my own.] The following pages illustrate how the twenty- two Hebrew letter archetypes are progres sively combined 8 to produce the Tree of Life diagram. 9 In other words, this book reveals how the Creator is 7 I have assigned the masculine gender to the Creator merely for the sake of convenienc e. It shoul d be underst ood that the Creator is actual ly beyond the concept of gender as we conceive it. The Hebrew name used to define the Creator in the Sefer Berashit is Elohim ( Myhla ) which literally means: powers , rulers , judges , divine ones , angels , or gods . 8 This process does, of course, occur outside the dimension we call Time, and theref ore any ordered sequence is pur ely symbolic. 9 It is a mistake to think that the ten sefirot are divorced from the Hebr ew letters, or that they are based soley on 'number'. The ten sefirot are called “utterances” in the Zohar becaus e they are 'voiced' into existence by the Creat or as He prono unces the Hebrew alefbet. The Hebrew letters also repre sent numbers, but the letters themsel ves ar e consider ed primary forces. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life thought to combine the twenty-two primordial archetypes to produce the manifested universe .

The three Mothers are impregnated by Ain Sof (the Father of All) and consequently give birth to the seven Double letters archetypes (who are associated with the Son principle). The twelve Simple letters archetypes (representing the Daughter principle) emerge into manifestation after the seven Doubles and form Malkut. The twelve Simples become illumin ated by the masculine force of the seven Doubles. These esoteric concepts will become clearer as you study this book.

(See Diagram 2.) When the universe was created, the twenty-two primordial archetypes arranged them selves according to the sym bolic structure of the Tree of Life and this design became the archetypal basis of the ultimate atomic unit (or 'anu') 10 of our universe. It could be said that the Tree's energy pattern describes the 'DNA' of Adam Kadmon 11 – the Universal Man. Every fundamental atom (phy sical, astral, and mental) of our universe i s built according to that divine blueprint. 10 See the book: Occult Chemistry , by Annie Besant and C. W. Leadb eater. Theosophical Publishing Hous e. 1919. The 'anu' was clairvoyantly observed by Leadbeater. Like the T ree of Life, it has a 3 + 7 n umerical stru cture. (S ee Diagram 3.) 11 Adam Kadmon is a kabbalistic repres entation (drawn in human form) of the macroc osm, or univ erse. 19 Diagram 3 : Leadbeater's 'Anu'"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life There are thirty- two components (i.e. “ thirty-two paths of wisdom ”) 12 that constitute the kabbalistic Tree of Life, but there are only twenty-two Hebrew letter archetypes. Therefore, some of the twenty- two archetypes are used twice during its construction. Each archetype however, is only used once in relation to the ten sefirot, and once in relation to the twenty-two pathways. For example, there is a sefirah whose attribution is the Hebrew letter Gimel, and there is a pathway whose attribution is also Gimel. These two components represent different expre ssions of the Gimel archetype because one is a sefirah and the other is a pathway. A special relationship however, exists between the Gimel sefirah and the Gimel pathway – a relationship whose significance becomes self- evident when the Tree of Life structure is examined.

It is therefore associated with Ain Sof 13 . It is similar to what is termed the “ Holy Breath ” and “ Breath of the Living God ” in Sefer Yetzirah , 1:9. Ten Sefiroth of Nothingness: One is the Breath of the Living God. Blessed and benedicted is the name of the Life of Worlds; The voice of breath and speech; And thi s is the Holy Breath . [SY, 1:9] The Spirit (or Breath) of God can be interpreted in these texts as kabbalistic code for the Hebrew letter Shin ( s ) because like Shin, the phrase RVCh ALHYM ( Myhla xwr ) is valued 300. 14 In the Sefer Yetzirah the letter Shin is associated with the Fire element so the phrase “ Breath of God ” can also be understood to be associated with the movement (or action) of divine elemental Fire. You will discover as you read through the pages of this book that the Tree of Life mandala is fundamental ly based on the interaction of three primary elements: Fire, Water, and Air. In this regard the Sefer Yetzirah will be our main guide and a lot of information from that sacred text will be employed during the Tree building proces s. Divine elemental Fire ( s , Shin) and Water ( m , Maym) exist within Ain Sof in a dormant unmixed state, but when Elohim chooses 13 Ain Sof (AYN SVP, Pwo Nya ) means 'Limitless'. It repres ents a state of being that exists prior t o the formation of the Tr ee of Life. 14 The Hebrew letters each have a numerical value attached to them. For example, Shin, s = 300. When the Hebr ew letters composing the term RVCh ALHYM are added together they also total 300. This traditional kabbalistic hermen eutic technique is called gematria and was sometimes employe d by ancient kabbalists to veil the sacre d mysteries. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life to actively combine Fire with Water divine elemental Air ( a , Alef) is produced. The Shin archetype (as occultl y described in Sefer Berashit 1:1- 2) can be symbolica lly understood as referring to the kundalini force located in the Creator's (“ Elohim ”, Myhla ) base chakra . Its movement 23 Diagram 4 : Ain Sof"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life is upwards towards the Maym archetype that is (metaphorical ly speaking) located in the Creator's crown chakra . 15 As these two cosmic forces merge together and interact, a creative spark of divine Consciousnes s (i.e. AVR, rw a , Light) is awakened. (See below.) This awakening repre sents the initial point of emergence of the creative influence of the Elohim into a new dimension of being. 16 So when the Sefer Berashit states: “ the Breath of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters ” it can be thought of as referring to the action of the Creator as He raises kundalin i Fire (using 'rhythmic breathing') and blends it with the Water element within His divine consciousnes s. Thi s merging produces the Air element. 17 As you will see (below) after the Air element appears it proceeds to separate back into its component elements Water and Fire, but as these two forces reappear they are stepped down so as to manifest within a denser level of being. This is the basic formula of Creation: Fire and Water combine to produce Air; Air then separates back into Water and Fire, and so on. As it is written in the Book of Formation... ...It comes out that all that is formed, and all that is spoken, emanates from one Name [ShM, Ms ]. [SY, 2:5] 15 It is well-known that the practice of 'rhythmic breathing' is able to stimulate the movement of the 'fiery serpent' through the chakra system. Sefer Beras hit is describing the same principle, but in a cosmic s ense. “As be low, so above.” 16 This principle is also reflected in the positioning of the Maym and Shin pathw ays above and below (and also c ontiguo us with) the sefirah Tifaret. (S ee be low.) 17 These elements ar e described m ore fully further on in this book. 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life The original Hebrew is: dx a Msm a u wy (“ emanates from one Name ”) 18 , and you will note that it contains the kabbalistic code sequence A - M - Sh - M - A (or, Air-Water- Fire-Water- Air). This proce ss reverberates and repeats down through all the lower worlds until the physical universe (as symbolised by the Earth element) comes into being. Keter 3. And God said [AMR, rma ], Let there be light [ AVR, rw a ]: and there was light. [Berashit, 1:3] “ Let there be light ” (“ Yehi Aur ”, r wa yhy ). These are the first words spoken by the Creator. They represent the first vibration that arises in the primordial void. The Creator takes His breath in Ain Sof (i.e. as represented by the previous two verse s of Sefer Berashit ), but it is not until He speaks that the twenty- two letters of the divine alefbet become 'audible' and the Creation begins to manifest. In this verse the creative Word is spoken, and its vocalisati on marks the appearance of the first sefirah of the Tree of Life. From Ain Sof comes Light ( AVR, rw a ) and its derivative: Air (AVYR, ryw a ). 18 The primacy of the divine elements Fire and Wate r is symbolised in the Hebrew word 'Name' (ShM) which is comprised o f the l etters Shin (Fire) and Maym (Water ). 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life Divine elemental Air is Light ( AVR) expressing itself in the decad (Yud, Y, y ). 19 The insertion of Yud (Y) into AVR to form AVYR represents the implantation in AVR of the structural seed and essence of the ten sefirot (i.e. represented by the first sefirah Keter ). 19 Because Yud = 10. 26 Diagram 5 : Keter"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life In the Book of Formation elementa l Air is represented by the Hebrew letter Alef (A, a ).

The sefirah Keter is still considered to be intimately attached to Ain Sof , and therefore it remains relatively 'unintellig ible', or 'inaudible'. 22 The Creation does not become intelligible until the second and third se firot appear. 23 (See b elow.)

As you will see, what makes the Light distinguishable from the Darkness (and thus what makes the universe intelligible ) is represented by the path of Bayt (B, b ) – the first letter of the Book of Creation ( Sefer Be rashit ). 24 Elemental Water (Maym, m ) is associated with the Light of Hockmah , and elemental Fire (Shin, v ) is associated with the Darkness of Binah .

The pathways that subsequently arise between them represent secondary coalescences, and these produce the seven lower sefirot. Thus, the seven lower sefirot represent specific dynamic inter- relationships (or resonances) that are established between the higher sefirot. These resonances are projected downward in order to form the lower branches of the Tree of Creation (i.e. as seven lower sefirot). For example, the sefirah Da'at represent s a dynamic interaction that arises between the higher sefirot Hockmah and Binah, or in other words, between the fundamental principles Maym (Water) and Shin (Fire).

This distinguishes Da'at from Keter because in Keter Light and Darkness are united, but concealed . The path of Bayt and its associated sefirah Da'at make it possible for all created beings to differentiate between the Light and Darkness principles. The Firmament is named Heaven ( ShMYM, Mymv ) because the Hebrew word for Heaven combine s within itself both Fire (Shin, v ) and Water (Maym, Mym ). 26 Consequently, everything that exists beneath 27 (or within) the Firmament of Heaven is dominated by the interaction of the Fire and Water elements. 28 The Air element (Alef, a ) is concealed behind Fire (Shin) and Water (Maym). This is reflected by Keter 's position behind Hockmah and Binah (on the Tree of Life diagram) and also by the position of the Alef pathway relative to the other two Mother letter pathways, Maym and Shin. (See below.) The Firmament circumscribes and contains the seven lower sefirot of the Tree of Life. The lower sefirot also symbolise the seven visible planets of our solar system. 29 Everything above Da'at on the Tree of Life is invisible to the microcosm 30 (i.e. because the higher sefirot exi st above and beyond the Firmament of Heaven ). 26 That is, as Sh + MYM where Maym is spe lled in full as MYM. 27 Meaning everything below the sefirah Da'at on the Tree of Life diagram. 28 Or in o ther wor ds, between what the Zohar calls Judgement and Mer cy. 29 On the Tree of Life diagram the firmanent encompasses the seven visible (i.e. to the naked ey e) planets, as we ll as the 'starry heaven', or circle of the zodiac.

The phrase “ waters which were under the firmam ent ” refers to the path of Maym that extends below Da'at and links it with the sefirah Tifaret. 31 (The esoteric inter- relati onship between the Waters above and the Waters below will become clearer later in this book when the path of Maym is examined.) The Book of Creation ( Sefer Berashit ) begins with the manifestation of the Bayt (B, b ) archetype, and so too is Bayt the first pathway to manifest on the Tree of Life diagram. 32 Bayt is the first of the seven Hebrew Double letters. The emergence of the seven Double letter pathways brings the seven lower sefirot also simultaneo usly into manifestation. The seven Double letters are referred to esoterically as 'Doubles' precisely for this reason. They play a critical role in erecting the sefirotic foundation of the kabbalistic Tree of Life, and they do so by manifesting in two ba sic forms – a 'soft' form and a ' hard' form. The soft forms of the Double letters are referred to the seven Double letter pathways . These pathways represent seven dynamic relati onships that exist between the higher sefirot. They are called 'soft' because of the necessary suppleness (or 'hollowness') that enables them to blend the energies of the higher sefirot. 31 And it also refers to the sefirah Hesed (as explained be low). 32 The path of Bayt is the first to manifest becaus e its appearance is require d to bring the first of the lower sefirot (i.e. Da'at) into manifestation. The first three sefirot derive their manifestat ion from the higher World. (Explained below.) The other Double letter pathwa ys follow after Bayt so as to bring the other six lower sefirot into manifestation. (See below.) 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life The Double letters manifest their 'hard' forms in the seven lower sefirot of the Tree of Life from Da'at to Yesod. The sefirot represent relatively fixed expressions of the Double letter archetypes while the pathways are more fluid in their expres sion. The Double letter pathways resemble the soul aspect whereas (in relation to the pathways) the Double letter sefirot are like the body aspect (i.e. they are a more materia l expres sion of the soul aspect). The hard forms of the seven Double letters are identified in the Hebrew language by a dagesh (small dot) that is located centrall y within the form of each letter. (See my diagrams.) The path of Bayt unites and separates Hockmah and Binah , and it is for this reason that the Lesser Holy Assembly states that the Creation technically begins in the sefirah Hockmah (Wisdom). 212. This Wisdom is the beginning of all things . Thencefrom are expanded the thirty- two paths: Nylybs , Shebilin, Paths , I say; and not Nyxra , Archin, Byways. 213. And in them is the Law comprehended, in the twenty- two letters and in the ten utterances. [LHA, § 212- 213] You may wonder why Rabbi Schimeon emphatical ly states (in the Zohar passage above) his preference for the Hebrew word 'Shebilin'. The reason may be that the word 'shebil' (Heb: ShBYL, lybs , 'path') is being used here as a kabbalistic key that ingeniously reveals the fact that the Bayt ( b ) pathway extend s between the sefirot Hockmah (Maym, m ) and Binah (Shin, s ). 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life The final two letters of ShBYL –i.e. 'YL' (10 + 30), equal 40. This is also the value of the Hebrew letter Maym. Thus, the letter sequence Sh-B-YL is equivalent to Sh-B-M or, Binah-Bayt- Hockmah. (See Diagram 7 above.) The manifestation of the path of Bayt automatica lly and necessarily results in the simultaneous appearance of the sefirah Da'at (lower down on the Tree). Like the path of Bayt, Da'at also repre sents the special relationship that is established between the sefirot Hockmah and Binah , but unlike the path of Bayt, Da'at is a sefirotic expres sion 33 of the Bayt archetype. The Greater Holy Assembly has this to say about the sefirah Da'at ... 566.

This is that which is written, Prov. ii. 4: \"And in knowledge shall the conclaves be filled.\" [GHA , XXVIII: 566- 568] 33 To put it simply, a sefirah is a stand-alon e (or fixed) expression of an archetype, while a pathway repre sents the same archetype as an expression of relationship .

For instead of tysarb , b'Rashith, “in the beginning,” it may be read, tys ar b , Bera Shith, “He created the six.” Upon these depend all things which are below (principally the Queen, who is the lowest path, or the bride of Microprosopus, and all the three inferior worlds.) 18.

The “ beard ” that hangs from the “ seven conformations ” is a reference to the seven lower sefirot. As we know, the seven lower sefirot are emanations of (or “ hang down from ”) the seven Double letter pathways. In other words, the symbolism of the “ beard ” refers to the sefirotic emanation that grows out of the “ head ”. Its “ thirteen portions ” can be thought of as the twelve Simple letter pathways plus the path of Shin (locate d in their midst). (See below.)

(See Diagr am 36 above.) So when (in our first quote above) the Zohar states: [Jacob] “ called his sons round him ” it is symbolic of this particul ar Tree of Life configuration because Jacob/Israel represent s the sefirah Tifaret, and Tifaret is clearly seen (in Diagr am 36) to be surrounded by his twelve sons – the twelve tribes of Israel as repre sented by the twelve Simple letter pathways of the Tree of Life. It should be noted that our earlie r Simple letter pathway configuration (see Diagram 30) shares similar characteristics to the one depicted above because in both versions the four cardinal sign pathways are joined to Tifaret and form the 'garden' that surrounds it. Similarl y, in both versions the four fixed sign pathways form the square 'wall' that encloses the garden of Tifaret, and the four mutable signs are positioned as the 'ceiling' that covers the garden of Tifaret. This basic similarit y effectively establishes a general rule that reduces the number of possible Simple letter pathway configurations to four. 64 Humanity is currently in proce ss of transitioning out of the Age of Pisces ( L ) and into the Age of Aquarius ( K ). We can interpret this shift from Pisces to Aquarius (in terms of Diagram 36) as a movement from the sefirah Yesod to Netzah to Hod.

This process of mitigation is called Tikkun Olam ('rectification of the world') in traditiona l kabbalistic terminolog y. In esoteric human anatomy the path of Maym corresponds to an influence that touches the upper half of (what is known in the East as) the 'shushumna nadi'. 75 The path of Maym represent s an energy that is most readily acces sible to the four highest chakras: the crown chakra , the ajna chakra , the throat chakra , and the heart chakra . On the Tree of Life diagram these four chakras are represented by the sefirot: Da'at (Crown), Hesed (Ajna), Geburah (Throat), and Tifaret (Heart). 75 The shushumna nadi is an energy channel that occupies a region (on subtle levels) that is conterminous with the human spinal column, and along it are positioned the seven major chakras. 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life Shin The path of Shin (Sh, s ) is closely associated with the influence of the sefirah Binah .

They are the two primary elements that bring Heaven (i.e. the Creation) into manifestation and sustain its existence.

They are centrally located directly below and within the Firmament of Heaven (i.e. below Da'at ) and function automatic ally to bring about steady progres s as the universe unfolds on its path of evolution and creation. It is, in fact, the interaction of these two primary pathways (and their associated elements: Water and Fire) beneath the Firmament of Heaven (i.e. below Da'at ) that sustains the existence of the Consciousness principle (or, Air) within the created universe. We saw this univer sal law in operation when the first sefirah Keter came into manifestation out of Ain Sof , and also when the sefirah Da'at made its appearance upon the Tree of Life. The same law is now seen to also be applied in regard to the sustainment of the sefirah Tifaret because on either side of Tifaret , on the middle pillar of the Tree of Life, are found the paths of Maym (above Tifaret ) and Shin (below Tifaret ). The sefirah Tifaret symbolises the central principle of Consciousnes s (i.e. Air) that inhabits the created univer se. The sefirah Yesod , unlike Tifaret , has direct acces s only to the path of Shin (i.e. Fire), and therefore Yesod must seek to cleave to Tifaret in order to receive the mitigating influence of the path of Maym (i.e. Water). The proces s of divine Creation is ongoing. The universe is not a static creation, but rather it is in a constant state of unfoldment.

This process is however, limited by the prevailing level of consciousnes s of Microprosopus 84 . During the divine creative process two hidden pathways on the Tree of Life manifest to microcosmic consciousnes s and become temporaril y active. These two esoteric pathways provide special ingress for the energies of supernal Water and Fire, or Mercy and Judgment (i.e. towards the seven lower sefirot). The creative influx of Mercy enters via a special Maym pathway that opens up between the sefirot Da'at and Hesed . The creative influx of Judgement enters via a Shin pathway that opens up between the sefirot Da'at and Geburah . The path of Alef regulates the distribution of these Shin and Maym energies from its place above the sefirah Da'at . This special influx of addition al Maym and Shin energies reconfigures the original Maym and Shin pathways (i.e. that extend below Da'at ) so that they reflect the Creator's ongoing creative- evolution ary program. The changes then reverberate through the seven lower sefirot and the twelve Simple letter pathways (and thus also through the seven astrologic al planets and the twelve zodiac al signs) .

The symbolism being used in these books of the Zohar expres ses various aspect s of the Tree of Life from different perspective s. Here 86 the perspective of the sefirah Da'at is from that of the macrocosm (i.e. Macroprosopus). The 'lips' symbolism ( described further below ) refers to the potential creative power of Microprosopus (i.e. microcosmic humanity) when he is rightly aligned with Macroprosopus. In the Zohar both the “ nose ” and the “ mouth ” are seen to be inlets and outlets for the 'spiritua l breath' of Ruach (RVCh, xwr ). The ' nose' symbolism we are discus sing in this chapter refers specifically to the influence of the macrocosm upon the microcosm . 85 This macrocosmic process is analagous to the microc osmic process whereby, for example, a yogi asserts conscio us control over the normally unconscious autonomic functions of his/her physical body. “As abov e, so below.” 86 The Greater Holy Assembly .

It then goes forth from the nose (i.e. Da'at) to the sefirah Geburah and thus to Microprosopus so that he may be “ aroused in the Garden of Eden ”. The “ Garden of Eden ” refers to six lower sefirot from Hesed to Yesod. The 'arousal' occurs as a result of the evolution ary force of the Fire of Shin as it is applied to Microprosopus. “ Wisdom ” is gained from the Water of Maym (i.e. the “ Spirit of Life ”) as it descends from the right hemisphere of the brain of Macroprosopus (i.e. Hock mah) through the right nostril (i.e. Kaf, k ) of the nose (i.e. Da'at) to the sefirah Hesed. The phrase “ hope to know Wisdom ” is used here because the influx of Maym only becomes conscious in the microcosm when the Hesed faculty has been integrated consciously in the human psyche. Thus the “ hope ” exists that one day we may all “ know Wisdom ”. 179. And from that galler y ariseth the Spirit, and proceedeth from the concealed brain, and at length resteth upon King Messiach [ MShY Ch, xysm ]. 180.

Da'at represents an interface that exists between Microprosopus and Macroprosopus and that enables a conscious relati onship to be established between them .

This stone has on it seven eyes, as it is written, \"On one stone seven eyes\" (Zech.

These correspond with the seven Double letter sefirot (i.e. from Da'at to Yesod) of the Tree of Life. The seven pillars rest upon a “ recondite and inscrutable myster y ” that cannot be known because it exists beyond the realm of Da'at ('Knowledge'). That unknowable mystery is, in the Zohar extract above, referred to as the “Holy of Holies”. It is represented by the three highest sefirot (i.e. Keter, Hock mah, and Binah) of the Tree of Life. The sefirah Da'at is symbolised by a 'stone' (Heb: eh'-ben N b a , ) that was cast by the Creator into the 'Abyss' and from which were hewn the seven s efirotic 'pillars'. The 'abyss' represents the apparent (i.e. to the microcosm) separation that occurs between the Creator and His creation.

The “seven eyes” that are on the 'stone' of Da'at symbolise the seven Double letter archetypes of which the letter Bayt (representing Da'at itself) is the first. The Da'at 'stone' is said (in the quote) to be “ compounded of fire, water , and air ” which is a reference to the special connection that the sefirah Da'at has with the three highest sefirot: Binah (Fire), Hockmah (Water), and Keter (Air).

So scripture says: \"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars\" (Prov. IX , 1). These in turn are upheld by one grade from among them called \"the Righteous One, the everlasting foundation \" (Ibid. X, 25).

This was the case when Maym and Shin combined in Ain Sof to produce Alef in Keter, and it is likewise the case when Maym and Shin (from Hesed and Geburah) combine in the soul of Adam to produce Alef in Tifaret. As regards the human microcosm (i.e. Adam), the influx of Maym and Shin from Da'at has the greatest potency (of Water and Fire) and therefore automatic ally generates a correspondingly intense radiati on of life-force, or Breath in Tifaret. This is needed (and provided) to sustain the momentum of the creative proces s – that is, to sustain the major creative work being undertaken by the receiver of such a powerful influx. A creative project that results from a Shin/Maym influx from Da'at may require years of Earth- time to complete and therefore the Holy Breath (in Tifaret) is provided in order to sustain the passion of the creator while he completes his work. The word 'passion' is perhaps the best word we can use to describe the enlivening life-force that is the Breath. Passion is the child of Will and Love. An important attribute of Shin/Fire is will , while the corresponding attribute of Maym/Water is desire (or love ). When 168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life these two attributes are combined together they produce the Alef/Air attribute of passion . The paths of Shin (Fire) and Maym (Water) combine to generate the soul's passion to live and to evolve. This is an innate passion that the human soul possesses from the moment of its inception at the beginning of Creation. This Breath is the passion that holds the soul focused and centered within the realm of Creation. The Fire and Water that issue from Binah and Hockmah via Da'at generates a new kind of passion. This is the passion to create . It's a passion that's acquired when the major trials of physical evolution are nearing completion. This passion strongly inflames the soul and supersedes the 'lesser' Breath (i.e. that is fueled in the soul by the paths of Shin and Maym). The Will of Shin is not necessarily the same as what we call the personal will of a human- being. Similarly, the Desire of Maym is not necessarily the same as a human- being' s personal desire . The Will of the original path of Shin is the Will of the macrocosmic Creator as it expres ses itself in our personal lives. It permeates our soul and physical nature and is an irresi stible evolution ary force that i s bigger than the will of the ego. Our personal will graduall y aligns with the Will of the original path of Shin as we begin to intelligent ly cooperate with the evolution ary current that is flowing through our lives . The Will of Shin that is received in the sefirah Geburah (i.e. from Da'at) is also an aspect of the Will of the macrocosmic Creator. It represents the Will of the Creator to involve Himself in the ongoing process of Creation.

The Desire of the original path of Maym represents the desire of the human soul. It is a deep desire that is able to guide us towards achieving our personal evolutionar y goals. It is not necessarily the same as our personal desire because in the early stages of human evolution our personal desire is based mainly on the superficial values of material ism (i.e. of the Form principle). When we follow the Desire of the path of Maym (i.e. the true desires of the Heart) we are guided towards acquiring skills and attributes and other personal resources that enrich our soul and psyche and that ultimatel y become the tools that we can use later when we become qualified to be involved in the macrocosmic creative process . To be able to follow the desires of the soul requires that we overcome the fear, glamour, and illusion that initiall y permeates the human personality. These influences natural ly arise within us because the human personality is submerged within the lowest three planes of the universe –i.e. the physical, astral, and (lower- )mental planes. These three levels of physicality are dominated by the influence of the Great Mother principle, and like children growing to adulth ood, we must eventual ly ween ourselves away from a natural ly developed over- dependency upon Her. We are all required to overcome the materiall y based influences of the Form principle and as we do so we conse quently rise in consciousnes s to the level of the soul.

The Desire of Maym received in the sefirah Hesed (i.e. from Da'at) is a higher expre ssion of desire than that of the path of Maym. It is an expression of the Father's (i.e. Hockmah's) Desire for the divine Mother principle (i.e. Binah). Hockmah longs to unite with Binah so that He can sire His progeny within Her fertile womb. Human- beings become actively and consciously involved in facilitat ing that process of divine conception (and birth) after the faculties of Hesed and Geburah have been suitably prepared. Human consciousnes s then becomes the medium through which the Father and Mother are able to combine Their creative energies so as to bring something divine to birth within the universe. Thus, as an individual becomes involved in the macrocosmic creative process , he/she combine s energy from all three of the sefirot of Day: Hesed , Geburah , and Tifaret . The Maym and Shin energies contributed by Hesed and Geburah are obtained from Da'at . The Breath of life (Alef) provided by Tifaret arises as Maym and Shin combine together within the soul of the microcosmic creator. It is the divine right and destiny of every individual (i.e. every microcosm) to eventually establish conscious contact (and become spirituall y aligned) with the divine Father ( Hockmah ) and the divine Mother ( Binah ) principles and thus participate in the eternal macrocosmic process of Creation. 171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life 172 Diagram 49 : The \"Cup of Salva tion\""},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Formation of the Tree of Life Alphabetical Index 375 ..................................................................................................... 142 613 ...................................................................................................... 119 Adam Kadmon ................................................................. 19, 61, 63, 73 ADM ('Mankind') ................................................................................ 99 Advocate .............................................................................................. 59 Ain Sof .................................................... 21p., 25, 27, 60, 67, 69, 135 Anus .................................................................................................... 86 Aquarius .......................................................................... 74p., 85p., 92 Aries ............................................................................. 74, 85p., 92, 99 Arikh Aphim (\"Long of Nose\") ................................................ 64, 143p.
