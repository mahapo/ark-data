The Key to the True Kabbalah is the final book of a four-volume set, which includes (i) the preamblatory Frabato the Magician (1979), a “mystical” novel which amounts to the author’s spiritual autobiography; (ii) Initiation into Hermetics (1956), a “course of magical instruction in ten steps”; (iii) The Practice of Magical Evocation (1956), instructions for e voking spirits, complete with seals. All of these titles have recently been reprinted by Merkur. The Key to the True Kabbalah treats its subject as a “cosmic language” linked by sympathetic correspondence to colors, elements, musical notes, etc., as well as analogous influences in the akashic , mental, astral, and material realms.

Of particular interest in the present context is Bloom’s section on the Mormons: Chapter 5, “The Religion-Making Imagination of Joseph Smith,” where Bloom states, “The God of Joseph Smith is a daring revival of the God of some of the Kabbalists and Gnostics, prophetic sages who, like Smith himself, asserted that they had returned to the true religion of Yahweh or Jehovah” (p. 99).

Trithemius absorbed not only Cabala’s angelic magic and its rituals, which utilized divine names, but also its ciphers and cryptological met hods. Scholarly debate over the beliefs and intentions of Trithemius comprise the discussion in the final chapter.

Copenhaver asserts that De magica naturali (1492-94) was the first description of Cabala in Renaissance France as a correction to Francois Secret’s contention that Symphorien Champier’s Ars parva Galeni (1516) was “la premiere presentation de la kabbale par un François” (in Les Kabbalistes Chretiens de la Renaissance [Paris: Dunod, 1964] p. 152). _________________. “Scholastic Philosophy and Renaissance Magic in the De Vita of Marsilio Ficino,” in • Renaissance Quarterly , vol. 37 (The Renaissance Society of America, 1984); and • Articles on Witchcraft, Magic and Demonology , Volume 11: RENAISSANCE MAGIC , edited by Brian Levack (New York/London: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1992). “Since the Enlightenment, the occultist tradition has lost almost all c ognitive authority am ong educated persons in the West, so much so that in our time an intellectual who seriously professed belief in magic would thereby call into question his own seriousness.

The Private Labyrinth of Malcolm Lowry: UNDER THE VOLCANO and the Cabbala . New York/Chicago/San Francisco: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1969. Private Labyrinth is the first “scholarly” book which I saw (in the early ’seventies) which drew a distinction between “The Two Cabbalahs,” namely Jewish and Christian —including the late occult “qabalah” of the Golden Dawn—without dismissing the latter out-of-hand, which, until recently, academics tended to do. Recall Scholem’s comments in Kabbalah , p. 203: “To this category of supreme charlatanism bel ong the many and widely read books of Eliphas Levi, Papus..., and Frater Perdurabo..., all of whom had an infinitesimal knowledge of Kabbalah that did not prevent them from drawing freely on their imaginations instead”; or in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , pp. 2 and 353: “From the brilliant mis understandings of Alphonse Louis Constant, who won fame under the pseudonym of Eliphas Levi, to the highly coloured humbug of Aleister Crowley and his followers, the most eccentric and fantastic"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"   43 statements have been produced purporting to be legitimate interpretations of Kabbalism ... No words need be wasted on the subject of Crowley’s ‘Kabbalistic’ writings in his books on what he was pleased to term ‘Magick,’ and in his journal, The Equinox.” Lowry’s letters suggest that Frater Achad was a particular favorite of his. In Epstein’s bibliography, however, some of the works listed as having been authored by Achad were written by others. Achad indeed wrote The Anatomy of the Body of God and QBL , but he was not, as Epstein has it, the editor of The Equinox or the author of Sepher Sephiroth (in The Equinox , Volume 1, Number 8); these were Crowley’s works. Nor did Achad write “A Note on Genesis” (in The Equinox , Volume 1, Number 2); this belongs to Allan Bennett. (All of these works are given notice in the present paper.) Faivre, Antoine.

Halevi’s series is quite popular among both Jewish and non-Jewish readers. Individual volumes range from instructional to inspirational in that they present versions of Kabbalistic ideas while suggesting ways to apply them toward spiritual growth. Specifically, The Work of the Kabbalist gives practical advice for individual work and School of Kabbalah suggests methods for developing group work; on the other hand, the earlier Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree and A Kabbalistic Universe are more theoretical.

As what was esoteric became exoteric, and t hough Kabbalah sort [ sic ] to portray itself as conservative and not innovative, its claim for ancient roots and for not revealing anything new brought it into conflict with other existing belief systems” (p. 103). “Thus, what is being suggested here is that the appearance of Kabbalah on the historical stage can only be understood as an exoteric phenomenon.

Mirsky writes (pages 18-19): My speculations on Dante and the erotic vibrations of the Commedia recalled to me the reading I had done in the Zohar , where dreams speak of knowledge of God through a spiritualized sex. I began to wonder whether Hell, Paradise, and Heaven in Dante were constructed out of similar ideas. Moses de Leon, the reputed author of the Zohar , was dependent on Maimonides. Dante’s philosophical tutor, Thomas Aquinas, was a careful student of the twelfth- century Jewish philosopher. Shlomo Pines, in the introduction to his translation of Maimonides’ The Guide of the Perplexed , speculates on the basis of a designation of the prophet Moses in the Inferno , that Dante had read Maimonides in Latin translation. The Neoplatonism of the thirteenth century underlay both the new mysticism of the Kabbalists and the dreams of the poets of Sicily and Bologna—texts that sought to draw together philosophic and erotic longing.

In the section of this article entitled “Renaissance and magic,” Quispel writes: Pico was wrong when he believed that Cabala came from Moses. But he sensed that the two currents [Hermetism and Cabala] were essentially identical. In this he was right, because both Hermetism and Cabala date from the same period of history, reflect the same culture, Hellenism, and originate in the same climate, Alexandrian gnosis. (pp. 224-5: [my brackets- DK ]) Only recently the texts found near Nag Hammadi in 1945 have shown that these Christian Cabalists [of the Renaissance and Reformation periods], although completely ignored by modern scholars, were on the right track. The Gospel of Truth , one of the first works of the Jung Codex, contains long speculations of Jewish esoteric origin about Christ as the Name of God. And few scholars would deny nowadays that according to the author of the Fourth Gospel, the Gospel of John, Jesus is the embodiment of that secret Name: ‘Holy Father, keep them through thine own Name, which thou hast given me’ (John 17, 11). And we see clearly that Paul sees Jesus as the Glory of God. Nay, even the mysterious title” ‘Son of Man’ has been elucidated, now that so many works from Nag Hammadi call the Son of God: Man. Son of Man, Aramaic bar anash , simply means ‘Man’ and indicates God who reveals himself in the form of a man. All these insights were in nuce already there in the works of these Christian Cabalists.

Saurat believed that within the Zohar one could find “the expression of occult doctrine” which “in a more or less diluted form, reached our poets” (Spenser, Milton, Blake, Shelley, Whitman, Goethe, Nietzsche, Hugo, and others). The final section, “The Philosophical Ideas of Edmund Spenser,” concludes with “Spenser and the Cabala.” ___________. Milton: Man and Thinker . New York: The Dial Press, 1925; rpt 1935. Saurat begins Section II, “Contemporary Sources and Influences,” Milton’s relationship to movements of his own time may be summed up thus: roughly speaking, the whole of Milton’s philosophy is found in the Kabbalah, except his materialism; his materialism is found in Fludd, except his mortalism; and his mortalism is connected with ideas of the contemporary English Mortalist group. The three stages are connected and form developments, one from the other: Fludd starts from the Kabbalah, and the Mortalists have their general principles in common with Fludd, and probably derived them from him.

Hanegraaff, Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998), Daniel Egmond writes (p. 336), ...in the fourth ‘cultic’ degree (i.e., the first degree of the third section) the student was taught various exercises that involved physical movements and the ‘vibration’ vowels. These exercises were combined with the Masonic signs and ‘grips,’ and were taught to be the means by which the ‘subtle energies’ of the body could be harmonized. In a note (p. 345, n. 90) Egm ond adds, These exercises played also an important role in the O.T.O. ; hence it is also possible that Steiner received them from [Theodore] Reuss. ... Another version of these exercises was published by Albert Schutz, Call Adonoi (Goleta, 1980)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"   55 Seligmann, Kurt. The History of Magic.

Suares’ series covers “the three great cabalistic works”: Genesis, Sepher Yetsira , and The Song of Songs. Suares does not consider Kabbalah to be mysticism but rather a science of cosmic energies, though in a hidden code. Suares’ thesis rests on the belief that each Hebrew letter “denotes not only a ‘letter’ but also a sign, a proof, a symbol and ever a miracle revealing its forgotten ontological origin.” In a chapter which is repeated in all three books, Suares explains the letter-code as he has discovered, or rather re discovered, it.

Here one finds raw material—lots of it—but Thorndike’s conclusions and opinions should not be taken as the last word (rather like reading Graetz on Kabbalah). The late Ioan Culianu’s comments seem too dismissive: A history of magic during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance has yet to be written. New discoveries and, a bove all, new interpretive viewpoints, have made obsolete the few existing syntheses, like those of Lynn Thorndike, Kurt Seligmann, or Emile Grillot de Givry. Any scholar who still relies on these works—especially on the first—is by no means better off than would be an anthropologist who relied exclusively on James G. Frazer.

Wolfson speculates that the motif of the cosmic tree combines Jewish and Christian influences. While doing so, he calls into question traditional lines of inquiry into certain subject matter (namely, the ten sefirot ) as the major indication of the origins of Kabbalah. Wolfson says, in effect, that if Sefer ha-Bahir is the earliest known work which can properly be called kabbalistic, its own contents suggest that something more—if not something other—than the sefirot comprises Kabbalah’s primal swirlings.

By the seventeenth century, cabbalism had become so fused and intermingled with other ways of thinking that we look for it less in defined doctrine and creed than in an a ttitude toward a question.

In Cabalistic interest, the [seventeenth] century begins with Robert Fludd whose so-called Mosaicall Philosophy is an amplification of Agrippa’s Cabalism. Fludd was, in some respects, akin to Pico, in that he tried to reconcile the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies. His attempt to do this was based upon the identification of the ten spheres of Aristotelian cosmology with the ten Sephiroth, which are obviously Platonic—i.e., Neo-Platonic—in character. (Joseph L. Blau in “The Cabala in English Literature,” page 158, noted below) Cabala is given its most concentrated treatment in the Second Section of B OOK 2, starting at CHAP. II, p. 171ff.

Now if any one pondering this in his mind, should be troubled how to reconcile the great variety and difference which is found amongst men, with the uniformity of their Original ; would not such an one, in order to the clearing of this difficulty, find it of use to consider the manifold members of mans body, all of which (though never so different) make up but one man ? And would not he by this means come to understand the true ground of this variety, which is found amongst men, and acknowledge, that notwithstanding all this, they are but an emanation from the highest Unity ? And when we compare this body, consisting of many members (every one of which are opperative and working to a higher degree of perfection) to an Army ? Can we make any other inference from what hath been said, but that every Souldier in this Army that hath well discharged his place, and done his duty, which belonged to him at such a time, is afterwards made an Officer, and so pro ceeds till he becomes a General ? But if any man should object, that this doth too far surpass all bounds of number, as well as the reason an comprehension of Man : May not we answer this Objection, by saying, that it is so much the better, forasmuch as this doth the more magnifie and set forth the Glory of God, who is, and is stiles the Lord of Hoasts ; and hath created us after his own Image, that we might bear a resemblance with him. Upon which account we are likewise called Kings and Priests, because of the surpassing great increase and glorification of our Beings, by means of this never ceasing melioration and Revolution ? As also this may teach us to have more certain, proper, and becoming thoughts of God ; forasmuch as one onely World is much too little to know God in, and find him out to perfection ? And that therefore there are Worlds without End, for that we can never come to an end in the knowledge of God ? For whatsoever the mind can comprehend, is less than the mind itself ; and consequently man is much more happy in feeling and perceiving of God, than he would be in comprehending of him, which is altogether impossible. For there is another way of perceiving God in mans mind, besides that which is meerly intellectual in the understanding, which when it is felt, the mind loseth itself in the perception of a sweetness which is altogether incomprehensible, and therefore inexpressible, and doth not proceed from mans own will, or from himself, but purely and alone from God, and surpasseth all understanding.

Therefore Men born into this World, (to speak properly) are not immediately created, neither in respect of Soul nor Body ; the external or outward Body, with the Life thereof, is that which belongs to this World of Fabrication ; but the Soul which is called Neshama , pertains to the World of Formation, which possesseth the middle place between the Soul and outward Body, and this Spirit by the Hebrews is called Ruach , but the Life and Spirits of the external Body are termed by the same Nephesh , there are therefore three vital principles in every Man, Neshama , Ruach and Nephesh ; Neshama of the World of Creation, Ruach of the World of Formation, and Nephesh of the World of Fabrication ; moreover Nephesh is the Cloathing or Vehicle of the ... Ruach , and Ruach is the Vehicle and Garment of the Neshama . ( Seder olam, pages 16—17) 51. Therefore this Asiaick VVorld, is to be again converted and reduced into the Superior and excellent Jeziratick VVorld, that all its parts may be re-united to these antient Souls, whereunto in times past, they belonged, that so at length the Souls and Bodies may be purified in this VVorld from all dreggs of Sin and Death, as in a refining Furnace of Affliction and Suffering, and lastly, eternally glorified in a indissolvable & incorruptible union of both Body and Soul. ( Seder olam, pages 21—22) 74. The plurality of the Worlds su cceeding one another, seems to be evinced by the 42 Pilgrimages of the Children of Israel , in the Wilderness, till they came at last to Gilgal , where, by the command of Joshua , they were Circumcised ; now Gilgal seems a Wheel or Revolution. ... 75. Moreover this Su ccession of Worlds is clearly proved from what we read in Scripture of a thousand, yea, of thousands of Generations, and yet from the beginning of this VVorld, to the end thereof, consisting of 7000 Years, there ca nnot be rekoned 400 Generations. ( Seder olam, pages 30—31) 19. This Truth being once demonstrated and granted, in a manner all the Mysteries and things difficult to be apprehended of the future Millennium, will be most easily understood ; for the Ignorance of the Souls, being born again, and returning to Life, in a body of Flesh, hath migh tily obscur’d the Mystery of the future Millenium, and in a manner all other Mysteries of the whole Christian Religion, which indeed (when the said new Birth or carnal Regeneration is demonstrated) will display themselves, and appear with a wonderful sweetness, fac ility, and the evidence of Truth. 20. First, therefore it shall be demonstrated by certain Arguments drawn from Scripture, that the same Souls, after death of the carnal Body were again raised to Life, and born of Parents in a Body of Flesh.

With the kabbalistic concept of gilgul (roughly, reincarnation , or transmigration ), van Helmont found his beloved doctrine supported by authority of the Bible.

Alchemist Vaughan describes two types of “Kabalah” in Magia Adamica : (1) the “true Kabalah,” whose “truths were unknown to most of those rabbins whom [Vaughan had] seen, even Rambam himself,” and (2) the “inventions of some dispersed wandering rabbis” which consist of “certain alphabetical knacks,” the varieties of which “are grown voluminous” (in Works ..., edited by A.E. Waite, page 167). Further, Va ughan speaks, following Sefer Yezirah , of the “The Literal Kabalah... [which] hath Three Principles, commonly styled Tres Matres , or Three Mothers,” namely, Aleph (air), Mem (water), and Shin (fire) ( Works... , page 168). Va ughan links the sefirot with Jacob’s ladder, stating that this symbol “is the greatest mystery in the Kabalah” in that here one finds “inferiors united with superiors” ( Works... , pages 169-170). Ultimately t hough, for Vaughan, “the learning of the Jews—I mean their Kabalah—was chemical and ended in true physical performances” ( Works... , page 171). In Lumen de Lumine , Vaughan equates the supernal sefirot with the Son ( hokhmah ) and Holy Ghost ( binah ), and thus, by inference, the Father ( keter ) ( Works... , page 295). He concludes Now, Reader, I have unriddled for thee the grand, mysterious problem of the Kabalist. “In the seven parts”—saith he—“there are two triplicities, and in the middle there stands one thing. Twelve stand in battle array : three friends, three foes; three warriors make alive; three in like manner slay. And God the Faithful King Ruleth over all from the Hall of His sanctity. One upon three, and three upon seven, and seven upon twelve, and all standing in close array, one with another.” ( Works... , page 305) Lumen de Lumine , edited by A. E. Waite, was republished in 1910 (L ondon: John M. Watkins). Both Magia Adamica and Lumen de Lumine are included in The Works of Thomas Vaughan , edited by A. E. Waite (London: John M.

Figures 8-12 show a tree derived from Emek ha-Melech representing stages from the initial tzimtzum (contraction), through the emanations in the form of a wheel, to the second Adam Kadmon and the parzufim (faces). Figures 13 and 14 show the sefirot in the world of azilut . Figures 15 and 16 depict the sefirot brought down in various ways to the lower worlds.

A summary of T HE B OOK OF THE R EVOLUTION OF S OULS is offered by Waite, Holy Kabbalah , pages 417-420. Some of the contents of De Revolutionibus Animarum are approximated in Sha’ar haGilgulim [ T HE E IGHTH G ATE ]: The Gates of Reincarnation , translated from the Teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria 1534-1575, translated by Yitzchak Bar Chaim (Malibu: Thirty Seven Books Publishing, 2003).* Note, however, that De Revolutionibus Animarum was translated from Sefer ha-Gilgulim , published in Frankfort: David Gruenhut, 1684—the same year as KD II), which contains both Lurianic and non-Lurianic material. Sha’ar ha-Gilgulim is the last section, or “gate” of Shemonah She’arim [T HE E IGHT G ATES ], redacted by Hayyim Vital’s son, Shmuel, and not printed until 1850-99 in Jerusalem. These works represent two different streams of Lurianic teaching: Sefer ha-Gilgulim is from the more eclectic “European” line which traces from Vital to Jacob Zemach to Meir Poppers, the redactor of Sefer ha-Gilgulim ; Abraham Azulai, author of Hesed le-Avraham , also influenced this European Lurianic kabbalah. Sha’ar ha-Gilgulim , the “Safed” line, passed from father to son and is limited to Luria’s teachings (though Shmuel’s version is a bit more inclusive than his father Hayyim’s earlier Etz Hayyim ).** _____________________ * On the Lurianic doctrine of transmigration, see also • David M.
