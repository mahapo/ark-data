It consi sts of a large body of speculation on the nature of divinity, the creation, the origin and fate of the soul, and the role of human beings. It consists also of meditativ e, devotional, mystical and magical practices which were taught on ly to a select few and for this reason Kabbalah is regarded as an esoteric offshoot of Judaism. Some aspects of Kabba lah have been studied and used by non-Jews for seve ral hundred years - see What is Hermetic Kabbalah."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Q1.2 : What does the word \"Kabbalah\" mean, and how s hould I spell it? The word \"Kabbalah\" is derived from the root \"to re ceive, to accept\", and in many cases is used synony mously with \"tradition\". No-one with the slightest interest in Kabbalah can fail to notice that there are many alternative spel lings of the word, the two most common being Kabbalah and Qabalah. Cab ala, Qaballah, Qabala, Kaballah (and so on) are als o seen. The reason for this is that some letters in the Heb rew alphabet have more than one representation in t he English alphabet, and the same Hebrew letter can be written either as K or Q (or sometimes even C). Some autho rs choose one spelling, and some choose the other. Some (the author for example) will even mix Q and K in the sa me document, spelling Kabbalah and Qlippoth (as oppose d to Qabalah and Klippoth!). A random selection of modern Hebrew phrase books and dictionaries use the K vari ant to represent the letter Kuf, so anyone who clai ms that the \"correct\" spelling is \"Qabalah\" is on uncertain gro und. There has been a tendency for non-Jewish books on K abbalah published this century to use the spelling \"Qabalah\". Jewish publications are relatively uniform in prefe rring the spelling \"Kabbalah\". The author takes the view (based on experience) tha t the spelling \"Kabbalah\" is recognised by a wider selection of people than the \"Qabalah\" variant, and for this pur ely pragmatic reason it is used throughout the FAQ. Q1.3 : What is the \"Tradition\"? According to Jewish tradition, the Torah (Torah - \"Law\" - the first five books of the Old T estament) was created prior to the world and she advised God on such weig hty matters as the creation of human kind. When Mos es received the written law from God, tradition has it that he also received the oral law, which was not written down, but passed from generation to generation. At times the oral law has been referred to as \"Kabbalah\" - t he oral tradition. The Torah was (and is) believed to be divine, and in the sam e way as the Torah was accompanied by an oral tradition, so there grew up a secret oral tradition which claimed to possess an initiated understandin g of the Torah , its hidden meanings, and the divine power concealed within it. This is a principle root of the Kabbali stic tradition, a belief in the divinity of the Torah , and a belief that by studying this text one can u nlock the secrets of the creation. Another aspect of Jewish religion which influenced Kabbalah was the Biblical phenomenon of prophecy. T he prophet was an individual chosen by God as a mouthp iece, and there was the implication that God, far f rom being a transcendental abstraction, was a being whom one co uld approach (albeit with enormous difficulty, risk , fear and trembling). Some Kabbalists believed that they were the inheritors of practical techniques handed down from the time of the Biblical prophets, and it is not imposs ible or improbable that this was in fact the case. These two threads, one derived from the study of th e Torah, the other derived from practical attempts to approach God, form the roots from which the Kabbalistic trad ition developed. Q1.4 : How old is Kabbalah? No-one knows. The earliest documents which are gene rally acknowledged as being Kabbalistic come from t he 1st. Century C.E., but there is a suspicion that the Bib lical phenomenon of prophecy may have been grounded in a much older oral tradition which was a precursor to the e arliest recognisable forms of Kabbalah. Some believ e the tradition goes back as far as Melchizedek. There are moderate ly plausible arguments that Pythagoras received his learning from Hebrew sources. There is a substantial literat ure of Jewish mysticism dating from the period 100A D - 1000AD which is not strictly Kabbalistic in the modern sen se, but which was available as source material to m edieval Kabbalists. On the basis of a detailed examination of texts, an d a study of the development of a specialist vocabu lary and a distinct body of ideas, Scholem has concluded that the origins of Kabbalah can be traced to 12th. cent ury Provence. The origin of the word \"Kabbalah\" as a label for a tradition which is definitely recognisable as Kabba lah is attributed to Isaac the Blind (c. 1160-1236 C.E.), who is also credited with being the originator of t he idea of sephirothic emanation. Prior to this (and after) a wide variety of terms w ere used for those who studied the tradition: \"mast ers of mystery\", \"men of belief\", \"masters of knowledge\", \"those who know\", \"those who know grace\", \"children of faith\" , \"children of the king's palace\", \"those who know wisdom\", \"th ose who reap the field\", \"those who have entered an d left\". Q1.5 Do I need to be Jewish to study Kabbalah? Some aspects of traditional Kabbalah are so deeply intertwined with Jewish religious beliefs and pract ice that they are meaningless outside of this content. Other aspe cts of Kabbalah (what I refer to below as Hermetic Kabbalah)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"have been studied and practiced outside of Judaism for so long that they have a distinct identity in t heir own right, and no, you do not have to be Jewish to study them, any more than you need to be English to study the Law of Gravitation. However, if you choose to study Kabbalah by name yo u should recognise that Kabbalah was and is a part of Judaism, and an important part of the history of Je wish people, and respect the beliefs which not only gave rise to Kabbalah, but which are still an essential part of Jewish faith.. Q1.6 : Is there an Obstacle to a Woman studying Kabb alah? Within Judaism the answer is a resounding \"Yes!\": t here are many obstacles. Perle Epstein relates some of her feelings on the subject in her book on Kabbalah (se e the Reading List below). The obstacles are largely grounded in traditional a ttitudes: it is less easy for a woman to find a Rab bi prepared to teach Kabbalah than it would be for a man. Persiste nce may reward (see below). Outside of Judaism the answer is a resounding \"No!\" : there are no obstacles. For the past one hundred years women have been active both in studying and in teaching K abbalah. Q1.7 : I've heard that one shouldn't study Kabbalah unless one is over forty years old? Is this true? The great Kabbalist R. Isaac Luria (1534-1572), beg an the study of Kabbalah at the age of seventeen an d died at the age of thirty-eight! His equally famous contemporar y R. Moses Cordovero (1522-1570) began at the age o f twenty. Many other famous Kabbalists also began the study e arly. This prohibition has come from Ashkenazic (East Eur opean) Jews and has never applied to Sepharidic (Mi ddle Eastern) Jews. The historical basis for the \"rule\" comes from opponents of Kabbalah within Judaism who (successfully) attempted to restrict its study. At the root of this was the heresy of false messiah Sh abbatai Tzevi (17th. C) which resulted in large numbers of Jews l eaving the orthodox fold. This heresy had deep Kabb alistic underpinnings, and in the attempt to stamp out Shab bateanism, Kabbalah itself became suspect, and spec ific prohibitions against the study of Kabbalah were ena cted (e.g. the excommunication of the Frankists in Poland in 1756). A further factor was the degeneration (in the eyes of their rationalist opponents) of 18th. century Ha sidism, which had roots both in Kabbalah and Shabbateanism, into \"wonder working\" and superstition. The rationalist faction in Judaism triumphed, and the study of Kabbalah became largely discredited, to the extent that many Jewis h publications written earlier in this century discus s Kabbalah (if at all) in a very negative way. Greg Burton has supplied this (mildly amusing) post from America OnLine, from a Rabbi Ariel Bar-Zadok: \" One thing I assure you, I am not a \"new ager\", nor am I sympathetic to any thing that is not pure, authoritative Kabbalah. Remember, Kabbalah means \"to receive\". I am a n Orthodox Sephardic Rabbi, ordained in Jerusalem. I teach only from the true texts, many of which most Rabbis for whatever reasons have never read. I document all my source s so as to verify to you that these teachings are authentic. (I must also admit t hat I have studied other religious and meditative systems, in this way I feel comfortabl e and confident to discuss them). My classes are open to all, Jew and Benei Noah alike, m en and women, (in accordance to Tana D'vei Eliyahu, Eliyahu Raba, Chapter 9). By the w ay, according to the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabi Ovadiah Yosef (Yehaveh Da'at 4,47) quoting Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, one only has to be 20 years old to study Kabbala, and not 40. THIS IS THE HALAKHA!!\" This still leaves R.Isaac Luria looking embarrassed , but R. Moses Cordevero scrapes in under the bar ; -) Q1.8 : Do I need to learn Hebrew to study Kabbalah? A Jewish Kabbalist would maintain that it is imposs ible to study Kabbalah without knowing Hebrew. Most Hermetic Kabbalists learn some Hebrew, but there ar e many practical exercises and ritual techniques wh ich can be employed with only a minimal knowledge of Hebrew. There is no question that a knowledge of Hebrew can make a very large difference. Non-Jewish texts on Kabbalah abound in simple mistakes which are due largely to uninformed copying. Thousands of important Kabbalis tic texts have not been translated out of Hebrew or Aramaic, and the number of important source texts in transla tion is small."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The difficulties in trying to read the archaic and technically complex literature of Kabbalah should n ot be discounted, but it is well worthwhile to acquire ev en a superficial knowledge of Hebrew. Four useful b ooks are: Levy, Harold, \"Hebrew for All\", Valentine, Mitchell 1976 Harrison R.K. \"Teach yourself Biblical Hebrew\", NTC Publishing Group 1993 Kelley, P.H., \"Biblical Hebrew, an introductory gra mmar\", Eerdmans 1992 Brown, F, \"The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Heb rew-English Lexicon\", Hendrickson 1979 Many Kabbalists view the Torah as the word of God a nd Hebrew as the language of creation. In this view the alphabet and language are divine and have immense m agical power. Many of the source texts of Kabbalah are commentaries on the Bible, and derive their insight s using a variety of devices, such as puns, anagram s, gematria (letter manipulations) and cross references to the same word in different contexts. The reader is pres umed to be adept at playing this game, which becomes completel y inaccessible in translation. Q.1.9 What is Hermetic Kabbalah? Many people who study Kabbalah are not Jewish. This has been happening for 500 years or so. It is diff icult to know what to call this variant of Kabbalah. \"Non-Je wish\" is inaccurate, as I have personally known sev eral Jews who opted for Hermetic Kabbalah in preference to th e traditional variety! At one time it was called \"C hristian\" Kabbalah, but this is also very misleading. The origin of this variant can be placed in Renaiss ance Italy in the last decade of the 15th. century. It was an amazing decade. In 1492 Christopher Columbus set sa il for America. In that same year the King of Spain expelled all Jews from Spain on pain of death, bringing to a n end centuries of Jewish culture in Spain, and cau sing a huge migration of dispossessed Jews through Europe, many of whom were welcomed by the Turkish sultan, who i s reputed to have observed that the King of Spain had enriched Turkey by beggaring his own country. At around the same time, at the court of the great banking family of the Medicis in Florence, Marcelio Ficino had established the Platonic Academy under the patronag e of the Medicis and was translating the works of P lato. A bundle of manuscripts, lost for centuries and datin g back to the 1st. and 2nd. centuries A.D. was disc overed; this was the Corpus Hermeticum , a series of documents relatingto Hermes Trimegist us, identical with the Egyptian god Thoth, god of wisdom. Cosimo de Medici told Ficino to stop translating Plato and to concentrate on the Corpus instead. At the time it was believed that the Corpus really was the religion of the ancient Egyptians, and that Hermes was a kind of Egyptian Moses. The fact that they were wri tten much later, and heavily influenced by Neoplato nism, had the effect of convincing readers at that time that Greek philosophy was founded on much older, Egyptia n religious philosophy - this had a huge influence on liberal r eligious and philosophical thinking at the time. In to this environment came the Kabbalah, brought in part by f leeing Spanish Jews, and it was seized upon as anot her lost tradition, the inner, initiated key to the Bible. Two figures stand out. One was Giovanni Pico, Count of Mirandola, who commissioned several translation s of Kabbalistic works, and did much to publicise Kabbal ah among the intellectuals of the day. The other wa s Johannes Reuchlin, who learned to read Hebrew and became dee ply immersed in Kabbalistic literature. It must be said that Jews were suspicious of this activity, finding that Christian scholars were using the Kabbalah as a bl udgeon to persuade them to convert to Christianity. It was out of this eclectic mixture of Christianity , Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Kabbalah and Renaissan ce humanism that Hermetic Kabbalah was born. Over the centuries it has developed in many directions, with strong influences from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, but continued input from Jewish Kabbalah has meant tha t many variants are not so different in spirit from the or iginal. Its greatest strength continues to be a str ong element of religious humanism - it does not attempt to define God and does not define what an individual should b elieve, but it does assume that some level of direct experience of God is possible and there are practical methods fo r achieving this. In a modern world of compartmentalised knowle dge, scientific materialism, and widespread cultura l and historical illiteracy, it provides a bridge between the spirit of enquiry of the Renaissance (the homo universalis or - in Hebrew - hakham kolel ) and the emergence of a similar spirit of enquiry in our own time. Q1.10 : Is Hermetic Kabbalah really Kabbalah? On the basis of my own beliefs and practice I would say yes, but others might contradict me, and ultim ately it is a matter of definition. Jewish writers on the subject tend to downplay aspe cts of Kabbalah which conflict with orthodox rabbin ical Judaism, so that we do not see the heretic Nathan o f Gaza classed as an important Kabbalist, despite t he fact that he was very influential for almost two hundred years. We hear little about the non-rabbinic \"Baal Shem\" o r \"Masters of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the Name\" who used Kabbalah for healing and other p ractical purposes. There is ample evidence that man y magical practices currently associated with Hermetic Kabbal ah were widely used and well understood by some of the most famous rabbinic Kabbalists. It is the author's opinion that Hermetic Kabbalah h as preserved up to the current day many practical t echniques, and R. Aryeh Kaplan makes the following significant com ment: \"It is significant to note that a number of techniques alluded to in these fragments a lso appear to have been preserved among the non-Jewish school of magic in Europe. The relationship between the practical Kabbalah and these magical schools would cons titute an interesting area of study.\" A more difficult question is whether Hermetic Kabba lah conforms to the spirit of Jewish Kabbalah. One of the most visible distinctions is that between theurgy and th aumaturgy, between the attempt to participate in th e workings of the divine realm for the betterment of the creation , and the attempt to interfere with its workings fo r personal betterment. Modern Kabbalah outside of Judaism appe ars in many guises, and is often associated or comb ined with ceremonial or ritual. It may be mixed with a wide r ange of theosophical traditions. This does not in i tself set it apart from historical Kabbalah. Ritual has always been an integral part of Kabbalah, and Kabbalah has absorb ed from cultures and traditions all over Europe and the Mid dle East. Even the distinction between theurgy and thaumaturgy may be meaningless, as similar techniques can be us ed for both - only by examining intention could one begin to judge which was which. Given the lack of a dogmatic tradition in Kabbalah it is not clear that the question about the legitim acy of Hermetic Kabbalah is meaningful. Even within Judaism it is u nclear what the authentic spirit or tradition is - there are large differences in outlook between someone like Abraham Abulafia and Isaac Luria. There is no good answer. One person will be reassur ed that the tradition is alive and going off in man y different directions - that is the sign of a living tradition . Another person will feel threatened by outsiders and dilettantes who are bringing the tradition into disrepute. About th e only thing which can be said with complete certai nty is that there is a great deal of prejudice. Just about everyone w ho studies Kabbalah seems to be certain that someon e else hasn't a clue what Kabbalah is about! Q1.11 : How can I find someone who teaches Kabbalah ? It is not possible to recommend specific people or organisations as what is right for one person may n ot be right for another. In general, (good) teachers of Kabbalah ar e not easy to find and never have been. There is a tradition that when the pupil is ready, a teacher will appear. The difficulty in finding a teacher can be viewed a s a nuisance or a positive part of learning Kabbala h. A thing is valued more when it is hard to find. Associate with people who share your interests, go to lectures an d public meetings, go to workshops, go to whatever happens t o be available, (even if it is not entirely to your taste), and sooner or later someone will \"turn up\". Many Kabbalists are people with strong personal con victions of a religious nature, and may see their t eaching as a personal obligation (see \"What is the Great Work?\") . Those who do not charge money for their teaching may require a strong commitment from pupils, and are unlikely t o welcome \"flavour of the month\" mystical aspirants . A word of advice: a genuine teacher of Kabbalah wil l help you to develop your own personal relationshi p with God. Beware of a teacher who has preconceived and well-d eveloped ideas about what is good for you, or who t ries to control the development of your beliefs. Section 2: Specifics Q2.1 : What is the Great Work? \"Do not pray for your own needs, for your prayer will not then be accepted. But when you want to pray, do so for the heaviness of the Head. For whatever you lack, the Divine Presence also lacks.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"This is because man is a \"portion of God from on high.\" Whatever any part lacks, als o exists in the Whole, and the Whole feels the lack of the part, You should therefore pray for the needs of the Whole.\" The term \"the Great Work\" has many definitions, and is not a term from traditional Kabbalah, but it ha s a modern usage among some Kabbalists. The quotation above, f rom a disciple of the Kabbalist R. Israel Baal Shem Tov, is a traditional Kabbalistic view: that the creation is in a damaged and imperfect state, and the Kabbalist , by virtue of his or her state of consciousness, can bring about a re al healing. A name for this is \" tikkun \" (restoration). There are many traditional forms of tikkun , most of them prescriptions for essentially magica l acts designed to bring about a healing in the creation. This view of the Great Work also exists outside of Judaic Kabbalah and survives today, namely that the creation is in a \"fallen\" state, and each person has an individ ual role to play in bringing about a general restor ation. \"When someone stands in the light but does not give it out, then a shadow is created.\" This is a modern restatement of an old Kabbalistic idea. In this view, God gives life to the Creation: from second to second the Creation is sustained by this giving, an d if it were to cease even for an instant, the Crea tion would be no more. If someone wants to know God then they have t o resemble God, and this means they must give to ot hers. Kabbalah is not a self-centred pursuit; it pivots a round the Kabbalist's relationship with all living beings. Q2.2 : I want to know more about the Archangels. The following information was derived initially fro m a discussion on alt.magick where several people c ontributed pieces, in particular, (in no order) Le Grand Cinq- Mars, Amanda Walker, Leigh Daniels, Patric Shane Li nden, B.A. Davis-Howe, Mark Garrison, Baird Stafford, and myse lf. Apologies if you said something and I missed it . Angels are found in the Judaic, Christian, Islamic and Zoroastrian traditions. The word \"angel\" is der ived from the Christian Latin \"angelos\", itself derived from the Greek \"aggelos\", which is a translation of the Hebr ew word \"mal'akh\", a messenger. Angels are typically found in groupings of four, se ven and twelve, reflecting their role in mediating the divine influence via the planets and the stars. For exampl e, in Zorastrianism there was a belief in the Amesh a Spentas, seven holy or bounteous immortals who were function al aspects of Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord. In Islam four angels are well known: Jibril (Gabriel), the angel of revelation; Mikal (Michael), the angel of nature ; Izrail (Azrael), the angel of death, and Israfil, the angel who plac es the soul in the body and sounds the last judgeme nt. The sources for the angels used in Kabbalah and cer emonial magic are primarily Jewish. The canonical O ld Testament books mention only Michael and Gabriel, b ut apocryphal and Talmudic literature provide riche r sources, and there is a suspicion that this was a result of contact with Zoroastrianism during the period of th e Babylonian Exile (6th-5th centuries BC). The four best-known a ngels are Michael According to one source his name is his war-cry: \"Who is like God?\". Michael i s at war with the great dragon or serpent, often identified with Samael in Jewish sources. Michae l's original position in the celestial hierarchy has been progressively eroded by angels such as Metatron. In medieval Kabbalah he is attributed to Chesed, but in modern Kabbalah he is attributed to Tipheret, and sometimes to Hod. Uriel/Auriel Uriel means \"Fire of God\", from the word \"oor\" meaning \"fire\" and Auriel means \"Light of God\", from the word \"or\" meaning \"light\". Both names tend to be used synonymously, and the association with light is common in Kabbalah. In medieval Kabbalah Uriel is a ttributed to Truth and the middle pillar of the Tree, in Tipheret. The association with light is sig nificant because of the importance of light in practical Kabbalah, where several differ ent kinds are distinguished, including: nogah (glow), tov (good), bahir (brilliant), zohar (radiant), kavod (glory), chaim (life), and muvhak (scintillating). In Christian times Uri el may have been"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"identified with Lucifer (\"light-bearer\") and Satan, an odd identification a s the diabolic angel according to Jewish tradition is Samael. Raphael Raphael means \"Healing of God\". Raphael is sometimes attributed to Hod and some times to Tipheret. Gabriel Gabriel means \"Strength of God\" and in medieval Kabbalah was attributed to G evurah (the words share a common root). In modern Kabbalah Gabriel can be found further down the Tree in Yesod, using his strength to hold up the foundations. The four archangels can be found in a variety of pr otective incantations where they guard the four qua rters, an almost universal symbolism which can be found in gu ises as diverse as nursery rhymes (\"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, bless this bed that I lie on\") to ancient Egy ptian protective deities. A well-known incantation can be found in the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (see below). The angel Samael is also important in Kabbalah. Sch olem shows (in \"The Origins of the Kabbalah\") that in early medieval Kabbalah, Samael retained some of the char acteristics of the Gnostic demiurge Ialdebaoth (the blind god), and derives the name from \"sami\", meaning \"blind\". He is attributed consistently to the planet Mars an d the sephira Gevurah, and is the source of all the nastiness in the world. He appears in various guises as the Dark Angel and the Angel of Death. The suffix -el betrays his divine o rigin, and Kabbalists have been divided between pla cing him at the head of a demonic hierarchy (alongside his wife Lilith), and viewing him as an unpleasant but nece ssary component of creation. Samael is identified with th e serpent in the Garden of Eden, a tempter and a po isoner of life. The archangel Metatron does not appear in many list s of archangels, but has an important role in Kabba lah as the archangel of the Countenance. Legend has it that Me tatron is none other than the Old Testament sage En och, lifted up to Heaven by God. Scholem comments that \"...ther e is hardly a duty in the heavenly realm and within the dominion of one angel among the other angels that i s not associated with Metatron\". Metatron is usuall y associated with Kether. There are many lists of seven archangels. Almost al l of them differ from each other. Mark O. Garrison (ORMUS@SORINC.CUTLER.COM) kindly provided the follo wing information which clarifies the difficulty: --Mark's material begins here-- The problem lies in from whence the author goes to research the names of the 7 Archangels. The earlies t sources giving the names of all Seven Archangels is ENOCH I (Ethiopic Enoch) which lists the names as followin g: Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Zerachiel, Gabriel, and Remiel The next two sources which originate within a few d ecades of each other list quite different names of the Seven Archangels. In ENOCH 3 (Hebrew Enoch) the Archangel s are listed as: Mikael, Gabriel, Shatqiel, Baradiel, Shachaqiel, Baraqiel, Sidriel While the TESTAMENT OF SOLOMON mentions: Mikael, Gabriel, Uriel, Sabrael, Arael, Iaoth, Adonaei The Xtian Gnostics changed things a bit further, bu t they still mention Uriel (though, in some cases t hey called him Phanuel). The compleat listing of the Archangels ac cording to their tradition is: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Barachiel, Sealtiel, Jehudiel Pope Gregory the Great wrote the Archangels as being the se 7: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Simiel, Orifiel, Zachariel Likewise, the Pseudo-Dionysians used a similar grou ping, mentioning Uriel also. They list the followin g as the Seven Archangels: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Chamuel, Jophiel, Zadkiel"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"It was not until much later times, around the 10th century C.E. when the name Uriel was replaced by ot her names in these much latter sources. In Geonic Lore, Uriel is replaced by Samael (The Angel of Light, or THE Lig htbearer, from whence the ideology of Lucifer had originated from also). In Geonic Lore the seven are noted as b eing: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Aniel, Kafziel, Samael, and Zadkiel Around the 12th to 15th centuries C.E. the name of Haniel came to replace the name of Uriel. However, the two being quite different in their Natures. The name Ha niel is common to the Talismanic Magical Tradition and other forms of Medieval Ceremonialism. These Medieval Tra ditions mention the seven as being: Zaphkiel, Zadkiel, Camael, Raphael, Haniel, Michael, Gabriel Also, a late sourcebook titled THE HIERARCHY OF THE BLESSED ANGELS mentions a different list of the seven archangels. They list them as following: Raphael, Gabriel, Chamuel, Michael, Adabiel, Haniel, Zaphiel It need be remembered, that the Judaeo/Xtian tradit ion originates from several religions and tradition s, each having its own legends and thusly, its own hierarchies and namings of the angels. In Islam, there are only fo ur archangels: Gabriel, Michael, Azrael (the Angel of Death, often interchanged with Uriel since the 15th century in some European traditions) for instance. One can easily d etermine the sources and origins of an book on Qaba la or Ceremonial Magick by what angels they use, obviousl y. I personally have drawn up a TREE OF LIFE for each of these traditions, based upon much research, for reference purposes. Note though, the differences do not stop with just the names of the Seven Archangels. These sources also do not agree on the Orders of the Celestial Hierarc hy, The Ruling Princes, The Throne Angels, and the Names of God, just to name a few! Are you starting to get th e idea yet, or are you more confused! [GRIN] :) :) --Mark's material ends here-- Baird Stafford (BSTAFFORD@BSTAFFORD.ESS.HARRIS.COM) provides the following list of references to archangels for those who would like to read the ori ginal source material: --Baird's material begins here-- And here is an expanded list of references to the A rchangels, including those cited by Br'anArthur. I' ve included verses from the Pseudepigrapha (which are the apocr yphal books of the Bible not included by the Roman church in its version of the Apocrypha, although I understand that some of them are included in the Orthodox Bib le). Uriel had a number of stand-ins who appear to have been other angels who took over his duties for a while: their names are Sariel, Strahel, and Suriel. I've not included thei r references. And, just for the fun of it, I've als o included some references from the writings of the early Christian gnostics.

Lower hand to solar plexus and visualize a line ext ending down to your feet, vibrate: Malkuth (the Kingdom) 3. Raise hand and touch right shoulder visualizing a s phere of light there. Vibrate: Ve Geburah (and the power) 4. Extend the hand across the chest tracing a line of light and touch the left shoulder where another sphere of light forms. Vibrate: Ve Gedulah (and the glory). 5. Clasp hands in center of chest at crossing point of horizontal and vertical lines of light. Bow head and vibrate: Le Olam, Amen. (for ever - amen.) 3.

The answer appears to be that it is inspired, at least in part, by particular Jewish prayers and meditational exercises. There are alternative versions extant, and one such is taken from a modern Jewish source. The source i s a pamphlet called \" A First Step - a Devotional Guide \" which was written by Zalman Schachter and reprint ed in \" The First Jewish Catalogue \" by Richard Siegel, Michael Strassfeld and Sharon Strassfeld, published by the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1973, ISBN 0-8276-0042-9. The blurb describing the pamphlet states: \"A First Step by Zalman Schachter is not a translation. It was first written in English. It is a contemporary attempt to make accessible spiritual and devotional techniques fr om classic Jewish sources, sources on which the pamphlet was based.\" [Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, (PhD and Professor Emeritus of Religion at Temple University, founder of the Jewish Renewal movement) is a very important teache r and scholar - Greg Burton] The author of the pamphlet states \"The approach used here is that of classical Jewish mysticism, as refin ed by Hasidism, and in particular, by the Habad school.\" [Chabad comes from Chokhmah, Binah, Daath - Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge - and is usually assoc iated with the Lubavitch tradition of Chassidism - Colin] Now to the exercise given: \"On other nights, after a short examination, screen yourself off from sounds and c ares by visualising an angel - a spiritual force field - of grace at your right, t his force field being impenetrable by care or worry; at your left, an angel of power and streng th; before you, an angel of soft light and luminousness, and behind you an angel of healing.

Due to ch anges in directional / elemental / archangelic posi tioning, it is not obvious (but clearly implied) that physically one i s facing North. Another change is that the LBRP doe s not bless the Divine, while the Jewish service does. This lack of blessing may reflect the not-so-covert Christian/R osicrucian bias in G.D. liturgy and a particular theology, or it ma y not. In any event, it changes what was originally an theurgic act into a thaumaturgic act. You might also note that many Jews coming across th e LBRP are deeply offended that the liturgy has bee n so grossly distorted, and is being used (from their pe rspective) sacreligiously. Telling them that it's \" just different\" carries about as much weight as telling traditional Native Americans that Lynn Andrew's work is \"just different\".

The word \"qlippah\" or \"klippah\" (plural \"qlippoth\") means \"shell\" or \"husk\". The idea of a covering or a garment or a vessel is common in Kabbalah, where it used, at various times and with various degrees of subtlety, to express the manner in which the light of the En Soph is \"encapsulated\" . For example, the sephiroth, in their capacity of recipients of l ight, are sometimes referred to as kelim, \"vessels\" . The duality between the container and the contained is one of t he most important in Kabbalistic explanations of th e creative moment. The word \"qlippah\" is an extension of this metaphor . A qlippah is also a covering or a container, and as each sephira acts as a shell or covering to the sephira precedin g it in the order of emanation, in a technical sens e we can say the qlippoth are innate to the Tree of Life. Cut a slic e through a tree and one can see the growth rings, with the bark on"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the outside. The Tree of Life has 10 concentric rin gs, and sometimes the qlippah is equated to the bar k. The word is commonly used to refer to a covering which contains no light: that is, an empty shell, a dead husk. It is also the case that the qlippoth appear in Kab balah as demonic powers of evil, and in trying to d isentangle the various uses of the word it becomes clear that ther e is an almost continuous spectrum of opinion, vary ing from the technical use where the word hardly differs from th e word \"form\", to the most anthropomorphic sense, w here the qlippoth are evil demonesses in a demonic hierarchy responsible for all the evil in the world. One reason why the word \"qlippah\" has no simple mea ning is that it is part of the Kabbalistic explanat ion of evil, and it is difficult to explain evil in a monotheist ic, non-dualistic religion without incurring a cert ain complexity.... If God is good, why is there evil? No short essay can do justice to the complexity of this topic. I will indicate some of the principle t hemes. The \"Zohar\" attributes the primary cause of evil to the act of separation. The act of separation is re ferred to as the \"cutting of the shoots\". What was united becomes di vided, and the boundary between one thing and anoth er can be regarded as a shell. The primary separation was the division between the Tree of Life (Pillar of Mercy ) from the Tree of Knowledge (Pillar of Severity). In normal perception the world is clearly character ized by divisions between one thing and another, an d in this technical sense one could say that we are immersed in a world of shells. The shells, taken by themselv es as an abstraction divorced from the original, undivided l ight (making another separation!) are the dead resi due of manifestation, and can be identified with dead skin , hair, bark, sea shells, or shit. They have been r eferred to as the dregs remaining in a glass of wine, or as the resid ue left after refining gold. According to Scholem, the Zohar interprets evil as \"the residue or refuse of the hi dden life's organic process\"; evil is something whi ch is dead, but comes to life because a spark of God falls on it; b y itself it is simply the dead residue of life. The skeleton is the archetypal shell. By itself it is a dead thing, but infuse it with a spark of life and it becomes a numinous and instantly recognisable manifestation o f metaphysical evil. The shell is one of the most c ommon horror themes; take a mask, or a doll, or any dead represe ntation of a living thing, shine a light out of its eyes, and becomes a thing of evil intent. The powers of evil appear i n the shape of the animate dead - skulls, bones, zo mbies, vampires, phantasms. The following list of correspondences follows the i nterpretation that the qlippoth are empty shells, f orm without force, the covering of a sephira: Kether Futility Chokhmah Arbitrariness Binah Fatalism Chesed Ideology Gevurah Bureaucracy Tipheret Hollowness Netzach Routine, Repetition, Habit Hod Rigid Order Yesod Zombieism, Robotism Malkut Stasis A second, common interpretation of the qlippoth is that they represent the negative or averse aspect o f a sephira, as if each sephira had a Mr. Hyde to complement Dr. Je kyll. There are many variations of this idea. One o f the most common is the idea that evil is caused by an excess of the powers of Din (judgement) in the creation. The origin of this imbalance may be innate, a residue of the mome nt of creation, when each sephira went through a pe riod of imbalance and instability (the kingdoms of unbalanc ed force), but another version attributes this imba lance to humankind's propensity for the Tree of Knowledge in preference to the Tree of Life (a telling and prec ognitively inspired metaphor if ever there was one...). The imbalance of the powers of Din \"leaks\" out of t he Tree and provides the basis for the \"sitra achra \", the \"other side\", or the \"left side\" (referring to pillar of s everity), a quasi or even fully independent kingdom of evil. This may be represented by a full Tree in its own right, som etimes by a great dragon, sometimes by seven hells. The most lurid versions combine Kabbalah with medieval demon ology to produce detailed lists of demons, with Sam ael and Lilith riding at their head as king and queen. A version of this survives in the Golden Dawn tradi tion on the qlippoth. The qlippoth are given as 10 evil powers corresponding to the 10 sephiroth. I referred to G. D knowledge lectures and also to Crowley's \"777\" (b elieved to be largely a rip-off of Alan Bennett's G.D. correspond ence tables), and found several inconsistencies in transliteration and translation. Where possible I have reconstructe d the original Hebrew, and I have given a corrected list."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Orders of the Qlippoth Sephiroth Qlippoth Meaning Kether Thaumiel Twins of God (TAVM, tom - a twin) Chokmah Ogiel Hinderers (?

The Breakers in Pieces are the powers of authority gon e bersek - Zeus letting fly with thunderbolts in all directions. Th e Flaming Ones refer to the fiery and destructive a spect of Gevurah. Lilith is the dark side of the Malkah or queen of M alkuth. Why Samael is placed in Hod is unclear, unless he h as been christianised and turned into the father of lies. In Kabbalah he is almost always attributed to Gevurah, sometimes as its archangel. Yesod is associated wi th the genitals and the sexual act, but why Gamaliel is un clear to me. I could easily concoct fanciful and pe rhaps even believable explanations for the attributions to Tip heret and Netzach, but I prefer not to. In \"777\" Crowley also gives qlippoth for many of th e 22 paths. If the transliterations and translation s are as accurate as those for the sephiroth, I would be tempted to r each for my lexicon. The G.D. teachings on the qlippoth are minimal in t he material in my possession, but a great deal can be deduced from those fascinating repositories of Kabbalistic myth, the twin pictures of the Garden of Eden befor e and after the Fall. There are so many mythic themes in these pict ures that it is difficult to disentangle them, but they seem strongly influenced by the ideas of Isaac Luria, an d it is now time to describe the third major interp retation of the qlippoth. Luria's ideas have probably received more elaborati on than any others in Kabbalah. The man left little in a written form, and his disciples did not concur in the prese ntation of what was clearly a very complex theosoph ical system - this is a subject where no amount of care will ensu re consistency with anyone else. Luria made the first step in the creation a process called \"tzim tzum\" or contraction. This contractio n took place in the En Soph, the limitless, unknown, and unknowable God of Kabbalah. God \"contracted\" in a process of self- limitation to make a space (in a metaphorical sense , of course) for the creation. In the next step the light entered this space in a jet to fill the empty vessels of the sep hiroth, but all but the first three were shattered by the light. This breaking of the vessels is called \"shevirah\". The s hards of the broken vessels fell into the abyss cre ated by contraction, and formed the qlippoth. Most of the l ight returned to the En Soph, but some of it remain ed in the vessels (like a smear of oil in an empty bottle) an d fell with the qlippoth. Scholem describes the shevirah and the expulsion of the qlippoth as cathartic; not a blunder, an archi tectural miscalculation like an inadequately buttressed Goth ic cathedral, but as a catharsis. Perhaps the unive rse, like a new baby, came attached to a placenta which had to be e xpelled, severed, and thrown out into the night. One way of looking at the shevirah is this: the sel f contraction of tzim tzum was an act of Din, or Ju dgement, and so at the root of the creative act was the quality whi ch Kabbalists identify with the source of evil, and it was present in such quantity that a balanced creation became possi ble only by excreting the imbalance. The shevirah c an be viewed as a corrective action in which the unbalanced powe rs of Din, the broken vessels, were ejected into th e abyss. Whether cathartic or a blunder, the shevirah was ca tastrophic. Nothing was as it should have been in a n ideal world. The four worlds of Kabbalah slipped, and the lowest world of Assiah descended into the world of the sh ells. This can be seen in the G.D. picture of the Eden after t he Fall. Much of Lurianic Kabbalah is concerned wit h corrective actions designed to bring about the repair or resto ration (tikkun) of the creation, so that the sparks of light trapped in the realm of the shells can be freed. The final word on the shells must go to T.S. Eliot, who had clearly bumped into them in one of his man y succesful raids on the inarticulate:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"Shape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force, gesture without motion;\" \"Those who have crossed With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom Remember us - if at all - not as lost, Violent souls, but only As the hollow men The stuffed men.\" Q.2.5: Why is Gevurah feminine? There is a common belief that certain sephiroth are \"masculine\" and other sephiroth are \"feminine\". Th is belief causes many problems in comprehending the Tree of L ife, and is a source of questions. For example, why is Gevurah, a martial and aggressive sephira, depicted as feminine, and why is Netzach, the nurturing, ca ring, emotional and aesthetic sephira, depicted as \"mascu line\". No convoluted explanations are required. The diffic ulties occur because of a carelessness in choosing words, and a misunderstanding about planetary correspondences. I n other words, the above depictions are inaccurate. Masculine and feminine are acquired behaviours whic h have changed over time, and many people are learn ing their Kabbalah from books written several decades ago. Th ese stereotype views of masculine and feminine were not shared by Jewish authors, who not only did not use these terms, but placed an entirely different meani ng on the terms they did use. If you take \"feminine\" to imply emotional, caring, and passive, and \"masculine\" to imply active, aggressive, and intellectual, then not only do you risk offending a large number of people who find th is stereotype insulting, but you wmay also have great difficulty in reconciling various correspondences for the seph iroth. A more appropriate characterisation of the differen ce between sephira is that of \"giving\" and \"receivi ng\". Kether is a sephira that only gives, and Malkuth is a sephira w hich only receives, and all other sephiroth are bot h giving and receiving, so that Binah receives from Chokhmah but gives to Chesed. [Things are not so simple; there is a tradition that when a current reaches Malkuth, it reflects an d travels back up the Tree again, so that even Malk uth and Kether play a part in giving and receiving. When human bei ngs carry out simple acts in their daily life with full consciousness, then this results in a small \"tikkun \" or restoration in the upper worlds - in other wor ds, it is our own actions which cause the reflection within Malkuth, and by doing so cause the \"spiritualisation of matt er\"] Kabbalists have used a sexual metaphor for this giv ing and receiving; they have observed that from a b iological point of view, the male \"gives\", and the female \"re ceives\", and have given the sephira Chokhmah the ti tle \"Father\" and the sephira Binah the title \"Mother\". In time, this distinction between male and female has been l ost, and carelessness has lead to the substitution of mascul ine and feminine, which entirely changes the origin al meaning. A second difficulty is caused by a common tendency in people to use the astrological correspondence of a planet as the primary means for understanding a sephira, so t hat for many people, Gevurah and Mars are synonymou s. This is equivalent to saying that because a sunflower remin ds me of the sun, the sun *is* a sunflower. The fac t that one is a luminous ball of gas and the other is a plant with yellow petals should give a clue as to the magnitud e of this kind of error. The metaphorical relationship between the se phira Tipheret and the sun is no closer than that b etween the sun and a sunflower. Likewise the relationship between Gevurah and Mars, and between Netzach and Venus - t his is an example of the finger pointing at the moon: look at the finger and you don't see the moon. What follows is a very brief characterisation of ea ch sephiroth, with a brief rational for the corresp onding planetary association.

Binah is concealed in this duality , in the separation between Kether and Chokhmah, an d expresses the possibility of duality, of separation between o ne thing and another. Binah is the Mother of Form, the root of separation which forms the basis for all distinctio ns and finiteness. The Mother receives the creative outpouring of Chokhmah and gives birth to it in Chesed. Chesed re flects the creativity of Chokhmah, but is condition ed by the boundaries and distinctions of Binah. Chesed create s within the realm of the possible; Binah defines w hat is possible. Gevurah is the response to boundaries. Chesed wants to move existing boundaries around, and Gevurah is the response to that. This response is typically reacti onary, a defense of the status quo, an attempt to k eep the boundaries where they were. Chesed is active - it changes the status quo. Gevurah is receptive - it takes the exi sting status quo and defends it. Netzach is the response to creativity. It is the pl ace of aesthetic judgements, of likes and dislikes, of passions for this and that. It is the adulation of a fan for a band, or an artist, or a politician. Hod is the appreciat ion of boundaries, a passion for classification, rules, detail, hair-spl itting definitions. Netzach is active; feelings tel l us what we should like. Feelings direct our behaviour. Hod is recepti ve, in that it elaborates what it is given. The more confusing planetary associations should no w (I hope) be clearer. Saturn is the sphere of limi tation, old age, death, and corresponds to Binah, the Mother of Form, from whose womb all finiteness comes. Jupite r, the leader, corresponds to Chesed. Mars (as the warrior defending the law and the State) corresponds to Ge vurah (but not Mars as the bloodthirsty berserker - this is an aspect of Chesed). Venus, the romantic aesthete, g oddess of love and sensual beauty, corresponds to Netzach. Mercury , the god of trade, science, communication, medicin e, discourse, trickery, corresponds to Hod. Do not expect to find a detailed consistency betwee n a sephira and its planetary correspondence: the s un is not a sunflower. There is a subtlety and generality, not to mentioned coherency, in the idea of sephirotic e manation which is not to be found in the planetary correspondences . Section 3: A Potted History of Kabbalah Kabbalists and scholars disagree on the date of the origins of the Kabbalah. Many Kabbalists trace the tradition back to 1st. century A.D. Palestine. Scholars tend to id entify Kabbalah with specific ideas which emerged i n 12th. century Provence in the school of R. Isaac the Blind, who h as been called \"the father of Kabbalah\". What is ab undantly clear however is that there is a continuous thread of Jew ish mysticism running from early times, and these s trands have become so intertwined with Kabbalah that it is diff icult to know where one ends and another begins. Fo r example, the highly influential text, the Sepher Yetzirah , was the subject of widespread commentary by medie val Kabbalists but the text may have been written as early as the 1st. century. Again, ideas from Jewish Gnosticism f rom the 2nd. and 3rd. centuries have also become deeply embedded in Kabbalah. The earliest documents associated with Kabbalah com e from the period ~100 to ~1000 A.D. and describe t he attempts of \"Merkabah\" mystics to penetrate the sev en halls (Hekaloth) of creation in order to reach t he Merkabah (throne-chariot) of God. These mystics appear to ha ve used what would now be recognised as familiar me thods of shamanism (fasting, repetitious chanting, prayer, p osture) to induce trance states in which they liter ally fought their way past terrible seals and guards to reach an ecst atic state in which they \"saw God\". An early and hi ghly influential document, the Sepher Yetzirah , or \"Book of Formation\", originated during the ear lier part of this period. By the early Middle Ages further, more theosophical developments had taken place, chiefly a descriptio n of \"processes\" within God, and the development of an e soteric view of creation as a process in which God manifests in a series of emanations, or sephiroth. This doctrine of the sephiroth can be found in a rudimentary for m in the \"Sepher Yetzirah\", but by the time of the publicati on of the book \"Bahir\" in the 12th. century it had reached a form not too different from the form it takes today. A motive behind the development of the doctrine of emanation can be found in the questions: \"If God made the world, then what is the world if it is not God?\" \"If the world is God, then why is it imperfect?\" It was necessary to bridge the gap between a pure a nd perfect being, and a manifestly impure and imper fect world, by a series of \"steps\" in which the divine light wa s successively diluted. The result has much in comm on with"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Neoplatonism, which also tried to resolve the same difficulty by postulating a \"chain of being\" which bridged the gap between the perfection of God, and the evident imperfection of the world of daily life. One of most interesting characters from the early p eriod was Abraham Abulafia (1240-1295), who believe d that God cannot be described or conceptualised using everyda y symbols. Like many Kabbalists he believed in the divine nature of the Hebrew alphabet and used abstract let ter combinations and permutations ( tzeruf ) in intense meditations lasting many hours to reach ecstatic states. Becaus e his abstract letter combinations were used as key s or entry points to altered states of consciousness, failure to carry through the manipulations correctly could have a drastic effect on the Kabbalist. In Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism Scholem includes a fascinating extract from a description of one such experiment. Abulafia is unu sual because (controversially) he was one of the fe w Kabbalists to provide explicit written details of practical te chniques. The most influential Kabbalistic document, the Sepher ha Zohar or \"Book of Splendour\", was published by Moses de Leon (1238-1305), a Spanish Jew, in the latter h alf of the thirteenth century. The Zohar is a series of separate documents covering a wide range of subjects, from a verse-by-verse esoteric commentary on the Pentateuch , to highly theosophical descriptions of processes withi n God. The Zohar was highly influential within mainstream Judaism (in some communities it was ranked as highl y as the Talmud as a source of interpretation on the Torah ), and within the more orthodox sects it still is. An important development in Kabbalah was the Safed school of mystics headed by Moses Cordovero (1522-1 570) and his successor Isaac Luria (1534-1572). Luria, c alled \"The Ari\" or Lion, was a highly charismatic l eader who exercised almost total control over the life of the school, and has passed into history as something o f a saint. Emphasis was placed on living in the world and brin ging the consciousness of God through into the world in a practical way. Practices were largely devotional. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Judaism as a whole was heavily influenced by Kabba lah, but two influences caused its decline. The first event was the mass defection of Jews to the cause of the heretic and apostate pseudo-messiah Shabbatai Tzevi (1626-1676) , an event Scholem called \"the largest and most mom entous messianic movement in Jewish history subsequent to the destruction of the Temple and the Bar Kokhba Re volt.\" The Shabbateans included many prominent rabbis and Kabbalists, and from this point Kabbalah became ine xtricably mired with suspicions of heresy. A second factor was the rise in Eastern Europe of a populist Kabbalism in the form of Hasidism, and it s eventual decline into superstition, so that by the beginning of this century a Jewish writer was able to dismis s Kabbalah as an historical curiousity. Jewish Kabbalah has vast lit erature which is almost entirely untranslated into English. A development which took place almost synchronously with the translation and publication of key texts of Jewish Kabbalah was its adoption by many Christian mystics , magicians and philosophers. Some Christians thoug ht Kabbalah held keys that would reveal mysteries hidd en in the scriptures, and others tried to find in K abbalah doctrines which might be used to convert Jews to Ch ristianity. There were some who recognised in Kabba lah themes with which they were already familiar in the literature of Hermeticism and Neoplatonism. The key figure in what has been called \"Christian K abbalah\" is Giovanni Pico, Count of Mirandola. The liberal atmosphere in Florence under the patronage of the M edici family provided a haven for both Jewish schol ars (usually employed as translators or physicians) and humanist philosophers. The fall of Byzantium provided a ric h source of Greek texts such as works of Plato and the Corpus Hermeticum . Giovanni Pico not only popularised Kabbalah, but influenced humanist scholars such as Johannes Reuch lin to learn Hebrew and study important source text s. Kabbalah was progressively bundled with Pythagorean ism, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism t o form a snowball which continued to pick up traditions as it rolled down the centuries. It is probably accur ate to say that from the Renaissance on, virtually all European occ ult philosophers and magicians of note had a workin g knowledge of some aspect of Kabbalah, and we are not talking about obscure individuals - there was a time when s cience, philosophy, metaphysics, theology and so-called \"oc cult sciences\" inter-mingled in a way which baffles the compartmentalised modern mind, and biographers of I saac Newton still have difficulty in accepting the things he studied when not laying the foundations of modern t heoretical physics! Non-Jewish Kabbalah has suffered greatly from havin g only a limited number of source texts to work fro m, often in poor translations, and without the key commentaries which would have revealed the tradition associated with the concepts described. It is pointless to criticise no n-Jewish Kabbalah (as many writers have) for misint erpreting Jewish Kabbalah; it should be recognised as a paral lel tradition with many points of correspondence an d many points of difference. Its strength is that a practi cal tradition has evolved, which many find effectiv e and worthwhile, and the original Renaissance humanism out of which it grew has remained intact, so that while it is br oadly Judeo- Christian in background, it is largely free of dogm a, and places the task of self-actualisation firmly in the hands of human beings."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Very little information has survived about the Prac tical Kabbalah in the Jewish tradition, but there i s abundant evidence that it involved a wide range of practices and included practices now regarded as magical - t he fact that so many Kabbalists denounced the use of Kabbalah for m agical purposes is evidence in itself (even if ther e were no other) that the use of these techniques was widespr ead. It is highly likely that many ritual magical t echniques were introduced into Europe by Kabbalists or their less scrupulous camp followers. The most important medieval magical text is the Key of Solomon , and it contains the elements of classic ritual ma gic - names of power, the magic circle, ritual implemen ts, consecration, evocation of spirits etc. No-one knows how old it is, but there is a reasonable suspicion that its contents preserve techniques which might well date back to Solomon. The combination of non-Jewish Kabbalah and ritual m agic has been kept alive outside Judaism until the present day, although it has been heavily adulterated at times b y Hermeticism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Pythagorea nism, Rosicrucianism, Christianity, Tantra and so on. The most important \"modern\" influences are the French magician Eliphas Levi, and the English Order of the Golden Dawn . At least two members of the Golden Dawn (S.L. Mat hers and A.E. Waite) were knowledgeable Kabbalists, and three Golden Dawn members have popularised Kabbalah - Aleister Crowley, Israel Regardie, and Dion Fortune . Dion Fortune's Order of the Inner Light has also produced a number of authors: Gareth Knight, William Butler, a nd William Gray to name but three. An unfortunate side effect of the Golden Dawn is th at while Kabbalah was an important part of its \"Kno wledge Lectures\", surviving Golden Dawn rituals are a sync retist hodge-podge of symbolism in which Kabbalah s eems to play a minor or nominal role, and this has led to K abbalah being seen by many modern occultists as mor e of a theoretical and intellectual discipline, rather tha n a potent and self-contained mystical and magical system in its own right. Some of the originators of modern witchcraft (e.g. Gerald Gardner, Alex Saunders) drew heavily on medi eval ritual and Kabbalah for inspiration, and it is not unusual to find modern witches teaching some form of Kabba lah, although it is generally even less well integrated into practical technique than in the case of the Go lden Dawn. To summarise, Kabbalah is a mystical and magical tr adition which originated nearly two thousand years ago and has been practiced continuously during that time. It ha s been practiced by Jew and non- Jew alike for abou t five hundred years. On the Jewish side it has been an integral a nd influential part of Judaism. On the Hermetic sid e it has created a rich mystical and magical tradition with its own validity, a tradition which has survived despite th e prejudice generated through existing within a strongly Christ ian culture.
