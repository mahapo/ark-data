[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Notes on the Zohar in English Don Karr [The original version of this paper appeared in Collected Articles on the Kabbalah , volume 1, by D. Karr (Ithaca, KoM #5, 1985: pp. 21-28).] The Zohar, or Sefer ha-Zohar , is without question the major text of classical Kabbalah. It is not a single book, but rather a collection of tracts of various sizes, there being about two dozen which form fairly coherent units. The bulk of the Zohar is a running commentary on the Torah, into which the numerous shorter tracts have been incorporated, added in the margins, or compiled as addenda to the various chapters. Some of the shorter tracts are in a separate section called the Zohar Hadash (the N EW Z OHAR ), and there is yet a third section called the Tikkunei Zohar (the A RRANGEMENTS OF THE Z OHAR ). Work concerning the authorship and chronology of the zoharic strata is on-going, though most scholars agree that the main body of the Zohar was written by Rabbi Moses de Leon (1250-1305) and perhaps some others in his circle toward the end of the thirteenth century into the beginning of the fourteenth. Later strata ( Raya Mehemna and the Tikkunim ), were written in the fourteenth century and added to de Leon’s work.* Since the 2001 update of this paper, it may be said that a publication which can viably claim to be a complete Zohar in English has been published—and two others have been promised; see below regarding the editions of the (1) Kabbalah Centre International, (2) Moshe Miller, and (3) Stanford University (= the PRITZKER EDITION) . Before this, only two-thirds to three-quarters of the Zohar had been put into English, and that spread over a handful of separate publications. __________ * On the authorship of the Zohar, see Yehuda Liebes, “How the Zohar Was Written,” in Studies in the Zohar (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993). On the Zohar’s internal chronology and on its subsequent collection and publication, the most recent work has been published in Hebrew articles by Ronit Meroz and Boaz Huss. © Don Karr, 1985, 1995, 2001-5 Email: dk0618@yahoo.com All rights reserved.

D IVISIONS OF THE Z OHAR : a chart showing the different tracts and sections of the Zohar along with initial-coded entries to indicate books which contain translations of them; 3. B IBLIOGRAPHY with notes, listing books, sections of books, and articles which discuss the Zohar or some aspect of it; many of these items contain translated passages; 4. R ECOMMENDATIONS concerning the pursuit of Zohar study; 5. “Zohar I 51b-52a...” 1. S OURCES OF THE Z OHAR IN E NGLISH T RANSLATION The most comprehensive guide to the Zohar is Isaiah Tishby’s Wisdom of the Zohar, the English version of which came out in 1989. (Complete publication information on this and all other books discussed in this section is given in the bibliography.) The Hebrew original, Mishnat ha-Zohar , has been a standard, lauded by scholars since its publication: volume 1 in 1949 and volume 2 in 1961. In form, Wisdom is an anthology of Zohar readings arranged by subject. Each subject is thoroughly and clearly introduced; each translated passage is supported by full explanatory footnotes. While most excerpts are a page or two in length, a few are quite extensive, such as the full translations of the section Yanuka ( i on the divisions chart), major portions of Sava ( h on the chart), and the first of the two Hekhalot sections ( f on the chart). ( Wisdom is keyed as IT on the chart.) The principal virtue of Tishby’s rich study is the organization which it lends to the Zohar by bringing together passages on similar or related subjects (which, in the printed editions, are scattered all over the place) and offering such complete and lucid introductions. By giving the reader so much help, Tishby makes the concepts of the Zohar, many of which are quite difficult and obscure, far more accessible than they would be from a translation standing alone. The work which from the ’thirties until just recently presented the largest amount of the Zohar in English (maybe two thirds) is the five-volume translation of Simon, Sperling, and Levertoff: The Zohar (Soncino Press, 1931-4, and a “student” edition by Rebecca Bennet Publications—frequently reprinted; keyed on the divisions chart as SSL). This set is often referred to as The Soncino Zohar .* _________ * The Soncino Zohar has been produced on CD-ROM for both Mac and IBM. The English text is the same as the books, but the CD-ROM also includes an extensive selection of major Zohar sections in Hebrew- Aramaic, the Bible in Hebrew and English, and the text of Rashi on C humash in Hebrew. The Soncino Zohar requires 4 meg RAM. On the Internet, go to www.soncino.com . "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Clearly, SSL’s idea was to present a coherent linear commentary to the Torah, but their omissions leave the reader frustrated. Missing are not only most of the inserted tracts but many of the particularly difficult passages from the running commentary itself. Introductory material and notes are minimal. Gershom Scholem ( Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , p. 387, n. 34) says of SSL, “This translation is not always correct but it conveys a clear impression of what the Zohar is. It is to be regretted that too much has been omitted. The innumerable deliberate falsifications of the French translator, Jean de Pauly, are of course not to be found in this more solid and workmanlike translation.” After seventy years, SSL’s Zohar was surpassed in scope by “The First Ever Unabridged English Translation with Commentary” offered by Kabbalah Centre International: The Zohar by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, with The Sulam commentary of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Yeshivat Kol Yehuda, 2001; VOLUME 23: Index : 2003). In twenty-two volumes the Zohar is presented, paragraph by paragraph, in the original Aramaic and in English. The English is a translation of Rabbi Ashlag’s Ha Sulam (T HE L ADDER ), namely Ashlag’s Hebrew translation of the Zohar containing his “embedded commentary,” which, in the Kabbalah Centre’s edition, is shown in a different typeface from the Zohar text. ( Ha Sulam was published in Jerusalem, 1945-55.) Most chapters are introduced by short summaries, which, starting at volume 3, are headlined “A Synopsis.” Some chapters are further set up by additional paragraphs headlined “The Relevance of the Passage.” Each volume contains a glossary of Hebrew words, including biblical names and kabbalistic terms. Ashlag’s commentary appositively identifies many of the Zohar’s widely (wildly) ranging referents with sefirot , parzufim , and other features fundamental to Lurianic developments. Elsewhere the commentary fleshes out the Zohar’s apparent shorthand (often by simply identifying the antecedents of potentially ambiguous pronouns). In some paragraphs, the commentary overwhelms the text; in others, no commentary at all appears. Of the Sulam commentary, Isaiah Tishby ( Wisdom of the Zohar , p. 105) says, “The explanations follow the Lurianic system and are of little help in clarifying the literal meaning of the text.” Comparison with SSL shows that Kabbalah Centre’s Zohar follows the same order but includes the material omitted from the earlier work. Thus, here one finds T HE B OOK OF C ONCEALMENT , the Idrot , both Hekhalot sections, etc. While not unreasonably priced at around $20 per hardbound volume, the whole set represents something of a commitment, especially considering that, as editor Rabbi Michael Berg’s introduction puts it, the Kabbalah Centre’s Zohar is “ deliberately not a scholarly edition” [Rabbi Berg’s italics]. What we do have is “a literal—not a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"vernacular—translation” where “[m]aterial has not been condensed or moved to achieve clarity or a more logical presentation.” Another multi-volume work from Kabbalah Centre is the extended translation of one particularly significant section of the Zohar prepared by Rabbi Phillip S. Berg: The Zohar: Parashat Pinhas (3 volumes, Research Centre of Kabbalah, 1987-8, keyed as PSB on the chart). The set presents a major portion of Raya Mehemna ( t on the chart). This translation is nearly identical to the Pinhas portions of the newer Kabbalah Centre Zohar (volumes 20-21), indicating that this work was also based on Rabbi Ashlag’s Ha Sulam, though not all of the Sulam commentary is included. Here and there Rabbi Berg inserts commentary of his own in clearly marked paragraphs separate from the text. Further, Rabbi Berg uses the Standard English names of biblical books and other terms (e.g., N UMBERS instead of Bemidbar ). Parashat Pinhas includes an introduction and helpful indices to the three volumes. Another “complete” Zohar which has been promised, but has thus far seen only its first volume published, is Zohar: Selections Translated and Annotated by Moshe Miller (Fiftieth Gate Publications, 2000). This inaugural volume provides introductory sections: “Historical Background,” “The Structure of the Zohar,” and “The Mystical Concepts of the Zohar.” Translated selections from the Zohar comment on the first four portions of the Torah: Bereishit , Noah , Lech Lecha , and Vayera . However, Miller does not begin with Zohar 1:1 and progress in the order of one of the printed editions as SSL’s and Kabbalah Centre’s do; he presents the commentary following the order of the biblical verses, drawing on all parts of the Zohar, including Zohar Hadash and Tikkunei Zohar . Embedded in the Zohar text in smaller type are comments and explanations drawn from classic commentaries, such as Or Yakar [R. Moses Cordovero] , Or ha-Hamah [R. Abraham Azulai] , Tanya [R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi] , Ziv ha-Zohar [R. Y. Y. Rozenberg] , Damesek Eliezer [R. Eliezer Tzvi of Komarna], and the foundation text for the Kabbalah Centre Zohar, Ha Sulam [R. Yehuda Ashlag]. The most important recent development in Zohar scholarship and publication is the Stanford University’s PRITZKER EDITION * of the Zohar, in both Aramaic and English, prepared by Daniel Matt. The English translation is from a “critical text” which Matt composed (using the Margaliot edition as a starting point) “based on a selection and evaluation of the manuscript readings” (p. XVII ) from some twenty “reliable manuscripts”—some dating as far back as the fourteenth century —along with the Mantua and Cremona editions of the sixteenth century—all in Aramaic, the original language of the Zohar (unlike the Kabbalah Centre’s translation, __________ * PRITZKER is the name of the sponsor of the Zohar translation/publication project— not the name of a Zohar publisher or manuscript as many assume. The Aramaic text which serves as the basis for Matt’s translation can be viewed at Stanford’s site, www.sup.org/zohar > Aramaic Text Online."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"which is based on a Hebrew translation and which includes embedded commentary). When completed, this edition will run twelve volumes. The first two volumes have been published (2004: VOLUME I, Z1:1a-76b, omitting Z1:38a-45b = Hekhalot , which will appear in a subsequent volume; VOLUME II, Z1:76b-165b). The numerous footnotes constitute a helpful commentary to the text. Matt draws on a range of traditional Zohar commentaries, including those of Moses Cordo- vero, Hayyim Vital, and Yehuda Ashlag, as well as the work of modern scholars, such as Reuven Margaliot, Isaiah Tishby, Gershom Scholem, Yehuda Liebes, and Charles Mopsik. Volume I includes an introduction by Arthur Green, which is reduced from his companion volume to the PRITZKER EDITION : A Guide to the Zohar , also published by Stanford. Green’s Guide provides an exquisite overview, covering the history, structure, style, and concepts of the Zohar. Matching the highest academic standards with genuine sympathy for the text— Matt describes his translation as “literal yet poetic” (p. XX )—the PRITZKER EDITION will undoubtedly become the English Zohar of choice among scholars and informed lay readers. There are a number of translations of one particularly important set of Zohar texts: Sifre deTzeniuta and the Idrot ( b, c, d, and e on the chart). Two versions among these stand out as the best—certainly the most faithful to the original: 1. Roy A. Rosenberg’s Anatomy of God (Ktav, 1972), which contains all four texts; 2. Pinchas Giller’s Reading the Zohar (Oxford, 2001), which offers Sifre deTzeniuta and Idra de bi Mashkana ( b and e). (For the other versions of these texts, see the bibliography under Mathers, Sassoon and Dale, Runes, and Work of the Chariot; these sections also appear in the Kabbalah Centre Zohar .) A translation of Midrash ha-Neelam to the B OOK OF R UTH ( s on the chart) comprises The Mystical Study of Ruth: Midrash ha-Neelam of the Zohar to the Book of Ruth, translated and edited, with introduction and notes by Lawrence A. Englander with Herbert W. Basser (Scholars Press, 1993; keyed EwB on the chart). “[A]pproximately one half of the text” of Sithre Othioth, The Secrets of the Letters ( p on the chart), is translated, and the whole text analyzed, in Stephen G. Wald’s book, The Doctrine of the Divine Name: An Introduction to Classical Kabbalistic Theology (Scholars Press, 1988; keyed SGW on the chart). "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gershom Scholem published a reader of Zohar excerpts in English: Zohar: The Book of Splendor, Basic Readings from the Kabbalah (Schocken Books, 1949, reprinted frequently). Scholem’s translations are of passages which appear elsewhere (e.g., SSL, Kabbalah Centre); however, his renderings are, in places, quite different. Another collection of excerpts, more extensive than Scholem’s, is Daniel C. Matt’s Zohar – The Book of Enlightenment (Paulist Press, 1983). A fine introduction and ample notes supplement the translations. (One wonders, though, about Matt’s setting these passages in a free-verse format.) Recently, a distressing abridgement of this book appeared as Zohar: Annotated & Explained (Skylight Paths Publishing, 2002), which offers about half of the passages from the Paulist publication. Explanatory notes, massaged into conventional prose from the more academic notes of the original work, face the pages of text. The most unfortunate victim of the abridgement is the introduction; the commendable 36-page introduction of the original work was chopped to a most inadequate 8 pages. Eight narrative segments from the Zohar are translated, with notes and extensive commentary, in Aryeh Wineman’s Mystic Tales from the Zohar (The Jewish Publication Society, 1997). In Dreams of Being Eaten Alive (Harmony Books, 2000), David Rosenberg treats the Zohar as one of the great works of world literature—albeit one not recognized as such. Rosenberg devotes some sixty pages to “New translations of the Kabbalah,” primarily Zohar, along with passages from Midrash Rabba, Sefer ha- Bahir , and Sefer Yetzirah , arranged by subject.* ________ * On the topic of dreams, in 1515 (Salonika) Rabbi Solomon Almoli first published his book of dream interpretations, Pitron Halomot . Almoli’s sources include the Talmud, the Zohar, R. Saadia Gaon, R. Hai Gaon, Maimonides, R. Eleazer of Worms, even Averroes, Avicenna, and al-Ghazzali. Two somewhat shortened translations of Pitron Halomot are available in English: 1. Chapter Two of Joel Covitz’ Visions of the Night: A Study in Jewish Dream Interpretation (Shambhala, 1990), who says (p. 9), “The first part of Pitron Chalomot ...is at times heavy, polemical, repetitive, and even boring... In the abridged text, I have sought to spare the modern reader (Almoli’s) obsessiveness....” 2. Yaakov Elman’s translation, Dream Interpretation from Classical Sources (Ktav, 1998), which is rather less abridged than Covitz’, includes two appendices: passages from R. Manasseh ben Israel’s Nishmat Hayyim and R. Judah Moses Ftayya’s Minhat Yehuda Haruhot Mesapperot . Elman’s introduction is scant. To fill this void, see Monford Harris’ “The Interpretation of Dreams by a Sixteenth-Century Rabbi,” in Studies in Jewish Dream Interpretation (Jason Aronson Inc., 1994), pp. 39-63.] See also Annelies Kuyt’s article, “With one Foot in the Renaissance: Shlomoh Almoli and his Dream Interpretation,” in Jewish Studies Quarterly , Volume 6, No. 3 (1999), Tuebingen, Mohr Siebeck."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2.

Stern and Mirsky— see the bibliography) is based on Z3 332-5 of the Margolioth edition. This pagination does not, indeed cannot, agree with our divisions chart in that our [Mantua] Zohar stops at Z3 299b. Mirsky notes that the translation appears in Zohar be-Midbar: Shelah Lecha , which, by our pagination covers Z3 156b-176a. SSL leaves a huge gap at 163a-174a: Mirsky’s passage falls inside this gap, probably somewhere around Z3 167a-168a.

Moreover, mystical annihilation itself is paradoxical, in that the unification of the self with God is also a unification of the cosmos and the divine self with transcendence in a way that is both annihilative, yet renewing and sustaining.” (p. 270) Levi, Eliphas.

Though the editor claimed that neither of these items from the Zohar had been previously translated, the so-called “Hechaloth” ( hekhalot ) section had already appeared in English several times: a. in SSL (1931-4) vol. 3, pp. 130-7, in a section which, in SSL, is rightly referred to as Raya Mehemna ; b. in Scholem’s reader (1949), pp. 77-81; c. in R. Yehuda Ashlag’s Entrance to the Zohar (1974), pp. 143-52, though this rendering appears to be paraphrased. Translations of “Petach Eliyahu,” a hymn from Tikkunei Zohar , had also previously appeared in English: a. in Raphael Ben Zion’s Way of the Faithful (1945), pp. 5-7; this collection was reprinted in the early ‘seventies by Yesod under the title Anthology of Jewish Mysticism (reprinted again in 1981 by Judaica Press, New York); b. in Louis Jacobs’ Jewish Ethics, Philosophy and Mysticism (1959) Chapter 20. In The Secret Garden (p. 149), the Zohar segment there called “Hechaloth” was mistakenly numbered Z1 42b-43a, which, if correct, would set this passage into the first of the Hekhalot sections.

Kabbalah Decoded gives yet another translation of Sifre deTzeniuta and the Idrot ( b-e on the chart), though with a unique purpose. Sassoon and Dale see in these texts a technical manual for a “manna machine,” thus offering a “non-mystical” explanation of how the Jews were fed in the wilderness. This theory is exhaustively developed in The Manna Machine (London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1978) by the same authors, in which they “lay bare the description [of the Ancient of Days of the Zohar] in all its anthropomorphic detail, matching it piece by piece to s imilar machines made today for oxygen regeneration and food production in closed environments.” They theorize that this manna machine was brought down by a being from outer space, who set it up to help the Jews. In spite of this far-flung interpretation, The Kabbalah Decoded offers a clear, “literal” translation of the texts from the original Aramaic, with many interesting notes on the peculiar language of the Zohar.

The midrashic notion that the human unites heaven and earth through being in the tselem of the ‘upper ones’ or heavens will be compared with the ideas that evolved in Kabbalah, especially in Yosef Ashkenazi and Isaiah Horowitz, in which the tselem within the human is comprised of the image of all beings and levels of creation.” (from the ABSTRACT ) Siegel, Andrea. “The Shekhinah: Foundation for Feminist Symbol?

Zohar I 51b-52a “Zohar I 51b-52a: an omission from the Simon and Sperling translation of the Zohar, translated from the French of Jean de Pauly by Thomas F. Daubert, Jr. and D. Karr,” originally published in Collected Articles on Kabbalah , vol. 1, edited by D. Karr (Ithaca: KoM [# 5], 1985), pp. 13-16.* (51 b) Note: the beings on high are all of the same illumination, being of celestial essence, whereas the beings below are of a different essence. They (the lower) are to this illumination (the higher) as the candle is to the flame. Note: all space is divided into 45 parts (of which) each shows a different color. These seven different colors are the ones which, upon the striking of their emanations against the gems from seven mines, draw forth water, for it is the air of the color white which changes itself in water. The light and the shadows are the only elements which form air and water. The one constituent element with light forms air, the one with shadows forms water. On leaving its source, the light divides into 75 channels directed toward the material world. Upon the light’s entrance into each of these channels a voice thunders which causes the deep to tremble. The voice makes heard these words: DIVIDE YOURSELF, O MATTER, IN ORDER FOR THE LIGHT TO PENETRATE WITHIN YOU. Thus it is written: DEEP CALLS TO DEEP AT THE THUNDER OF THY CATARACTS (channels) [Ps. 42:7]. Below these channels there are 375 trenches, of which one part is of the color white, another of the color black, and the third of the color red. These trenches are divided into 17 classes, of which each presents the shape of a chain-net. Two of these chain-nets have the quality of iron, and two others that of copper (or brass). At the two extremities of space are situated two thrones which are in constant communications with the channels and the trenches which go from one to the other. Each of these thrones forms a sky, one of which is on the right side and the other on the left. The one on the right is of the color black and the one on the left is multicolored. (52 a) As the light goes from one throne to the other, it follows, for each time that the light of a throne has reached the other, by means of the course of channels mentioned, it returns near to the first throne to draw for itself new strength."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Thus, the light travels, through specific channels, from the throne on the right to the throne on the left, and returns, through certain other channels, from the throne on the left to the throne on the right. So it is with the blood in the veins of the human body. The blood ascends to the heart through specific veins and returns through others. Such is the vision of this area of space which forms seven different colors. These seven colors constitute the supreme mystery. Seven other lights are divided into seven seas, which together amount to one giant sea. This last is the supreme sea where seven others are concentrated. The seven lights previously discussed fall into this giant sea and then become separated into seven parts, to correspond to the number of seven seas which, in essence, form the branches of the greater one, and thus is it written: AND SMITE IT INTO SEVEN CHANNELS [Is. 11:15]. Each of the seven branches subdivides into seven pools, each pool into seven rivers, each river into seven streams. The result is that the one preceding the water of the giant sea, of its branches, of its seven pools, of the seven rivers, of the seven streams, is connected (all with all). A large fish, emanating from the left side, runs over all these courses of water. Its scales are as solid as iron. A flame shoots from its mouth which consumes all that returns along its path. Its tongue is tapered like a sword. With all its might it strains to penetrate the sanctuary, which is the giant sea, to defile its holiness, to extinguish the lights, and escape from the waters of the giant sea, once frozen, never again to impose itself on its (the sea’s) branches. This mystery is conveyed in the words of the scriptures: NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE SUBTLE THAN ANY OTHER WILD CREATURE THAT YHVH ELOHIM HAD MADE . The awful serpent wanted to realize his goal: to defile the upper holiness by beginning to contaminate man here in the lower world. Recognizing the manner of construction of all the courses of water, he understood that causing the water of a stream to be briny would, in effect, reach all the way to the great sea. That is why he came to seduce man down here (on earth): in order to intercept the inferior watercourses with the major ones. The serpent had thus brought on the death of the world. He emanated from the left side. He was able to furtively enter the interior of man. But there is another serpent which emanated from the right side. Both serpents accompany man throughout his life. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The scriptures said: ... MORE SUBTLE THAN ANY OTHER WILD CREATURE THAT YHVH ELOHIM HAD MADE . For not all the animals on earth had been endowed with so much skill at wronging man as has been the serpent—because he constituted the veinstone of gold. Bad luck to him who permits himself to hurry away from the serpent, for the serpent will cause that person’s demise, and that of his su ccessors as soon as that have arrived. Adam was unable to avoid the serpent because he wanted to taste all of the pleasures (secrets) of the world below. The serpent, in showing him all of the pleasures of the world, interested him, and caused death for him and for all the generations which succeeded him. Until the day when Israel was placed at the foot of Mount Sinai, the contamination of the serpent did not vanish from the world. As the scriptures said, That was when Adam and Eve sinned by attaching themselves to the tree of death.  ______ * This rendition of Z1:51b-52a was completed in the winter of 1978, being the first of a proposed series of translations from various sources selected to fill the numerous gaps in SSL.
