[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"QabCross Page 1 of 2 http://www.geocities.com/dayobscured/QabCross.html 4/22/2002 Rite of the Qabalistic Cross 1. Stand facing East. Imagine yourself expanding, getting larger and larger. Visualize yourself standing with the E your feet (about the size of a soccer ball). Imagine yourself continuing to grow and expand, until you are so larg e galaxies spin around you. Visualize a ball of white Light, burning like a star, directly above your head. Raise eit h Elemental or Planetary Banishing Dagger in your right hand above your head, pointing straight up, and pierce th e Dagger. Visualize a shaft of white Light rising vertically from the star above your head to infinity. Vibrate \"AThH,\"(Ah-teh) while lowering the Dagger down to touch first your forehead (while vibrating syllable), then your breast around the heart area (while vibrating the second syllable), and extend the shaft of Light downwards as you move. 2. Lower the Dagger to the groin area, with the tip still pointing straight up (Israel Regardie taught that one should never point a Magical Dagger downward toward the Earth). Vibrate \"MLKVTh.\"(Malkuth) Visualize shaft of white Light, descending from the star above your head, to another star beneath your feet, and onward, through the center of the Earth, to infinity. 3. Touch your right shoulder with the point of the Dagger (you should feel the sharp tip), and vibrate \"VGBVRH H Geborah) Visualize another star shining where the Dagger is touching your shoulder, and a shaft of white Light, extending to your right, and on to infinity. 4. Touch your left shoulder with the point of the Dagger, and vibrate \"VGDVLH.\"(Ve-Gedulah) Visualize anoth e p lace where the Dagger is touching your shoulder, and a shaft of Light extending horizontally to your left, to infinity. 5. Bring the Dagger, pointing upward, to your heart. Move it in a circular counter-clockwise motion (toward the l top downwards, then up to the right), several times, as you vibrate \"LOVLM.\"(Le-Ohlahm) 6. Clasp your hands together over the center of your chest. Interlace your fingers, and hold the Dagger between your knuckles, pointing upward (The interlaced fingers symbolize the ten Sephiroth). Extend your elb o horizontally, along the plane of the horizontal shaft of Light, extending from the stars at your shoulders. Visualiz e standing at the center of a blazing Cross of white Light, which extends to the ends of the Universe, as you vibrat e \"AMN.\"(Amen> or So Mote It Be!) If the proceding ritual is too elaborate, it can easily be shortened by removing the visualizations. I find the visua l be useful but I will include the shortened form for those of you who prefer efficiancy to elaborate ritual. 1. Stand facing east. Touch the point of your elemental dagger (or wand, or hand, or whatever) to your forehead AThH (Ah-Teh) [meaning thou art, or unto thee... I prefer to replace this with EHIEH-pronounced Eh-hay-yay, w I am) 2.Touch the dagger to the center of your chest and vibrate MLKVTh (Malkuth, meaning The Kingdom) 3. Touch the dagger to your right shoulder firmly and vibrate, VGBVRHH (Veh-Geburah, meaning - and the po w 3. Touch the dagger to your left shoulder firmly and vibrate, VGDVLH (Veh-Gedulah, meaning- and the glory) 4. Clasp the dagger in your hands before you or above your head and vibrate AMN (amen, or so mote it be!) This rite is used as an opening to a hermetic ritual. It is a state ment of either 1. your faith in your god and you r p erform magick through him (or her, or it, or whatever), or 2. your ability to perform magick through your own symbolized by replacing \"thou art\" with \"I am.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"QabCross Page 2 of 2 http://www.geocities.com/dayobscured/QabCross.html 4/22/2002 "}]
