[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"QABALA AS A SPIRITUAL PATH Iona Miller, c1987 I inquire, I do not assert; I do not here determine anything with final assuran ce; I conjecture, try, compare, attempt, ask... Statement of Purpose: The orientation of the Synergetic Qabala sites is to provi de serious qabalists with modern conjectures in Theoretical Qabala with the aim of cont emporizing our models and practices. The emphasis here is on mysticism and meditation, rather t han ritual and magick. These essays, artwork, and visualizations are not meant as a new dogma, practice, or school of thought. They are simply the result of my own thirty-plus years of qabalistic work. I hope they provide a springboard for your own thought. They are meant to stimulate and provoke your own speculations, insights, and experiments. Qabala is not a static doctrine, but a living Way. Qabala is an experiential pa th, an experiment which lasts throughout one's life. Qabala is ultimately about acce ss to and experience of discrete states of consciousness, ways of being and becoming. To gl ean its wisdom, we must \"sample the dish,\" not simply read the recipes. It is a subject whic h cannot be exhausted. We must make it our own, even while honoring its tradition. In this way, we have the best of both worlds. Qabalistic traditions and models are validat ed by modern research everyday. It has a vast capacity to incorporate the entire repertoire of human knowledge and understanding, coordinating through its primary glyph, the Tree of Life. We can update our models and create revolutions in our own beliefs and thinking, much the same as happens in science. Therefore, we will be drawing on resources from pos t quantum physics, Jungian and Transpersonal Psychology, and traditional and modern philosophical speculation, such as Buckminster Fuller's Synergetics. I hope y ou find valuable concepts here for bootstrapping into your own worldview and facilitating your journey toward Union. \"Ever since the Lord ordained the Creation, I have been pledged to return to my original home. People know, from my quest for unity in God, that I am as anxious as I am eager to merge with him. I shall bear the blows of destiny as I pursue him, while I am ferried across to him on the boat of his love. No one ever found the Lord while living, O Bahu, except those who found him by dying while living.\" Sultan Bahu, 17th Century Sufi saint, Punjab, India "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THE SYNERGETIC QABALA The premise of Synergetic Qabala is based on the fa ct that manifesting form is essentially energetic. Form is not other than force, and force is often indistingu ishable from form. Forces interacting in dynamic stabilization are essentially, therefore, synergeti c. The right and left Pillars of the Tree of Life a re in a state of dynamic tension, as well as other polarities which it embodies. While Synergetic Qabala is essentially a geometrical philosophy, it is not a sterile number mysticism, but a theosophical approach to the unfathomable mysteries of Qabala and its essentiall y mystical orientation. The Tree of Life is a model of the universe that de scribes energy's behavior and also has the ability to shape our thinking. Synergetics describes the actual unde rlying geometry of subatomic structure. Here we emp loy nature's own coordinate system, the geometry nature uses for self-organization --the tetrahedron. Ther e is a relationship between geometry and number which is i ntrinsic to the spheres and geometry of the Tree of Life. It defines the philosophical universe of Qabala. Ex plorations in this geometry are covered elsewhere i n \"The Synergetic Qabala.\" The ancient system of the Qabala may best be descri bed as a mystical theosophy, an effective guide for understanding ourselves and our relationship to the universe. It provides a cohesive worldview which i s consistent with the findings of modern physics, psychology, an d philosophical thought. It provides not only a phi losophy, but a Way of life. It is a mystical discipline which requ ires an active spiritual practice for realization. As in the case of physics, there are two main branc hes of Qabala. The first is speculative or Theoreti cal Qabala and the second is Practical Qabala which concerns the a pplication of its principles through theurgic magic and/or mystical meditation. It is a complex system of symb ols and principles for developing the inner potenti al of human nature, leading to the stage of conscious service t o the divine powers at the source of all creation. Though often spelled many ways, we employ the simplest translite ration of QBL, as Qabala (ka-ba-la). Though associated with the Hebrew, and later Hermet ic philosophers, the roots of Qabala possibly origi nated in Egypt. The Western occult tradition attributes it t o Hermes Trismegistus, or Thoth (Egyptian inventor of writing, astronomy, and mathematics). These teachings belong to ancient Egyptian mystery traditions that predat e Plato and the Bible, with treatises on ancient cosmology and sacred psychology. The Hermetic tradition enjoyed a revival when Marsi lio Ficinio translated a bundle of ancient Egyptian manuscripts with the collective name of the Hermetica (1463). The Hermetica has been called the fountainhead of Western spirituality, the motherlode of all later esoteric and metaphysical systems. Here we find the suggesti on that mankind is a hybrid of human and divine elements. Human nat ure is potential divinity, or \"Godseed.\" Hermetics opened the way to independent spiritual seeking--spontaneous G od contact--in the West. It suggests the possibilit y of transhumanization, and the divine mission of cocrea tion. Egyptian religion is the prototype and source of ma nkind's interest in seeking immortality. It is the source of mystical teachings on reincarnation, magic, healing , the mysteries and the rudiments of sciences such as astronomy and chemistry. The other primary source of mythic m aterial comes from Sumeria with its stories of God- men, the Great Flood, the creation of Adam, and the nature o f deep time ( Enuma Elish ) and the Cosmos. They developed a rich culture, including the first recorded kingship , libraries, and systems of measurement, and sacred geometry. The Zodiac developed from Mesopotamian astronomy. Early Jewish initiates believed Qabala's mysteries were first taught by God to a school of angels. Acc ording to legend, the angels in turn transmitted it to Adam a fter the Fall in an attempt to help humanity regain its balance. These mythic images suggest a Mesopotamian origin f or these doctrines which is lost in the mists of pr ehistory. Remember, the Hebrew patriarch Abraham began his sp iritual journey away from paganism toward monotheis m in the Mesopotamian city of Ur, (in the heart of the a ncient Sumeria, where recorded history, culture, an d modern technology began). We can use the Qabala today as a guide for our pers onal growth, both psychological and spiritual. Qaba la helps us get in conscious contact with latent or hidden aspe cts of our deep mind, collective inheritance, and S ource. The imagery and phenomenology of Qabala is well documen ted. The universe is an emanation or flowing forth of Godhead, the primal Source It is an expression of t he dynamic fullness of divine Life. This plenum or matrix is the source of divine apark s who plunge into the long process of involution or descent through the planes into manifestion. They eventuall y undergo an evolution in which new and infintely d ifferentiated aspects of the original, unmanifest potentiality of the Godhead comes to expression. Ascent up the cen tral column of the Tree of Life is the mystic's path to spiritual awakening and absorption. The Source can be experie nced directly and discovered within us. This universal paradigm c orrelates with all mystical traditions. It is the v ery ground of our self-awareness."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The qabalistic Universe is a spatially conceived co smos divided into higher and lower worlds or heaven ly spheres of influence. Qabala is about the relationship of the One to the Many, and the Many to the One; all are c onceived as active aspects of Living Deity and their dynamic in terrelations. It describes a vast panoply of involu tion and evolution. It is an immense network of embedded sym bolism and arcane lore, which begins with a cosmolo gy, (a scenario about how the universe and humanity came i nto being; the patterns of nature in relation to th e moral and psychological aspects of human behavior). The qabalistic Genesis begins with the emanation of Ain Soph , \"supreme wisdom,\" the Godhead as pure light-fille d creative intelligence, source of all manifestation. The Limitless Light flows out into the 10 Spheres of the Tree of Life down through the Four Worlds of Creation: Arch etypal (divine), Causal (mental), Astral (emotional ), and Physical. Emanation means that God sent forth a por tion of his own essence into the manifestation, rat her than creating a separate reality. This cosmic pattern or design reflects the divine order, the pervasive de sign of the world. The succession of numbers 1 through 10 symbolizes a nd is, in fact, identical with the emanation of the manifest Universe. The 22 letters of the Hebrew alp habet contain and create the secret structure of al l things. The cosmic process is an unfolding of the mystical name of God. Each letter corresponds with a path on the Tree of Life, and functions as a mystical \"gateway\" to its experience. Though originally an oral tradition, written philos ophical doctrines can be traced to the 3rd through 13th centuries. The foundational text of written Qabala, the Sephir Yetzirah, ' The Book of Formation' is based on alphanumeric mysticism. It describes how God created the manifes t universe by means of letter/numbers which are the foundation of all things. The letters are part of 'one body,' the alphabet which is an extention of God's own bei ng. All created things, made by means of the letters, a re also parts of the one body which is God. Contemp lation of and meditation on these Hebrew letter/numbers is fundam ental to accessing discrete mystical states. Mystic al understanding of this divine Unity is the first con cern of qabalism. This is part of the origin of the power of the Word or Logos in the crossroads cultures of the Mid dle East. In ancient Egypt the specific organ of cr eation was Ptah's mouth, \" which named all things. \" Like the descending emanations from the divine sour ce, the soul leaves its home in Godhead and descend s into physical form, where its redemption comes through s eeking that from which it originated. Thus, Qabala is a Path of Return to the pristine state, but with an experient ial legacy. This legacy comes from \"dying while living,\" a meta phor for the daily \"death\" to the outer world in my stical meditation. Ultimately Qabala is a solitary pursuit , but one best conducted with an experienced guide. Remember, no teacher can take you any further than they have been, and there are real psychological and spiritua l dangers in the realm of the collective unconscious. Not everyone is naturally equipped to discriminate subtle tricks of the mind (mental imbalance, halluc inations, delusions, ego inflations, flights of fancy) from a uthentic spiritual insight. True mystical experienc e, like scientifically conducted experiments, is repeatable and reproducable. It is approximately the same for all practitioners, everywhere, in all times. The same is not true for what psychologists call \"m agical thinking,\" which is a pre-rational, rather t han transrational state, characterized by a plethora of superstitions and often paranoid ideations. Much of so-called Ne w Age thought is characterized by these romanticized superstition s and faulty conclusions based on sporadic results from unsystematic, idiosyncratic rites and practices. We may be well-intentioned when we embark on self-d irected studies, but this method can take you no fu rther than the Self, where many magicians make the mistake of setting themselves up as an ersatz God and worshipp ing their own willfullness. Is not setting oneself up as one' s own God the ultimate folly, and the mistake which turns the adept into a Black Magician, deifying his own personality ? We must abandon our narcissism to take up the quest for archetypal origin. It involves personal sacrif ice and ordeals. Four factors show the difference between s omeone who has creative fantasies and someone who i s only spinning neurotic nonsense: originality, consistenc y, intensity, and subtlety. Though the roots of magic and schizophrenic fantasy spring fom the same source, they are not synonymou s. Magic is a counterphobic attitude, the transition from pa ssivity to activity. In fantasy, realistic action d oes not follow; it is a substitute for healthy, pro-active behavior. The eg o is weak or totally absent, engaging in fruitless attempts at restitution. True aspirants show continuity of devotion to God, not self-aggradizment. One learns how to navigate i n the imaginal realm--an as if reality--without taking it literally. We learn to become absorbed in the Divine without mistaking our spiritual awakening for de facto pers onal deification. The attitude is one of \"Not my wi ll but Thine be done.\" It is the spirit of submission and selfless service to the Divine Will."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Reports of angels and demons are commonplace in Qab alistic literature. Once again, this speaks of a Me sopotamian origin or subsequent influence. The crossroads cult ures of the Mediterranean and Middle East influence d one another's philosophies. In late antiquity there was a mingling of Gnostic, Neoplatonic, the ancient Hebrew Merkabah tradition, and magical speculation with Babylonian notions of angelic, dem onic, and divine powers. This influenced the develo pment of mystical lore. This co-mingling (syncretism) had lo ng been established by the time the central text of Qabalism, the Zohar was written in 13th century Spain. In terms of Jungian psychology, the angels seem to correspond with inner guides or wisdom figures, whi le the demons are analogous to psychological complexes. Qa balistic speculation asserts that angelic guardians and demons can block one's progress to ascent. In many ways th ese \"entities from other dimensions\" represent diff erent aspects of the human psyche--forms of our higher and lower selves. Psychologically, we know that imbalance and neurosi s are blocks to our growth, self-defeating behavior s. Angels can be seen as transpersonal resources, while demon s manifest within us as autonomous subpersonalities with their own agenda, not necessarily in synch with our perso nalities goals. Somewhere in between common angels and demons comes the notion of the daemon, genius, or Holy Guardian Angel--a personal inner guide which appears as sync hronicities, inspiration, creativity, intuitive kno wing, or directly as a personified figure for dialogical exchange. An gels are messengers which mediate between the divin e and the human. The angel instructs and inspires, draws forth and n urtures our talents. We connect with our personal e ssence and self-expression.It can be a guardian of the thresho ld of the mysteries, harsh taskmaster or the source of seemingly infinite creative expression. But, once summoned, i t will not be ignored without peril. Attainment of \"Knowledge and Conversation\" with this singular Angel is the p rimary operation of elementary theurgic magick, and is central to further progress and transcendence. The purpose of the Qabala (QBL) is to help us exper ience the Mysteries directly through personal encou nter, both inwardly and outwardly. It is no mere study, but an applied philosophy. The transformative lessons of the Qabala come through life experiences and consciousness jou rneys. It is visceral and emotional, as well as men tal. It is a perspective on life that is actively immersed in th e mythic as well as personal worlds. The adept has a foot in, or walks between both worlds. The doctrine of Qabala is based on the premise that God created mankind in his [their] own image. The Creation is attributed to the Elohim, male/female deities actin g as agents of the supreme God. There is a hierarch y of hyperdimensional entities which inhabit the various subtle planes of the universe. Each of the classes of angels has a specific relationship and duties toward mankind. Th ey are all in service to the self-revealing dynamic God of religious experience. An existing God means a manif est, revealed and related God. The guiding axiom of the Creation is \"As Above, So Below.\" This Hermetic axiom means that there is an archetypal identity between divinity and mankind, m ankind and the Universe. This intimates that mankin d can achieve a \"cosmic consciousness,\" since \"we are tha t.\" We can \"receive\" this knowledge or revealed Tru th directly from the Source, through QBL which literally means \"to receive.\" There are six major principles of the Qabala: * The cosmos is a Unity, with all aspects in interr elation. It is a wholistic worldview. * The forces of creation represent an eternal inter play between an active force and a passive one; pol arity (positive and negative charge, male/female, yin/yan g, holding the tension of the opposites). * The human individual is a microcosm of the univer se; we come to know the universe through ourselves, and ourselves through cosmic principles. * In daily life we are attuned to only one state of consciousness among many. This is the culturally programmed trance state known as ordinary conscious ness, or consensus reality. * We can access multiple states of consciousness, in cluding universal or cosmic consciousness through systematic application of concentration and meditat ion, by the grace of God. Careful preparation is necessary. * To achieve such transcendent states of consciousn ess various specific practices and techniques are u tilized. The main concern of the practicing Qabalist lies in the applications of its teachings to his own life. In other words, we are interested in psychological and spiritual gr owth with a greater understanding of Universal prin ciples. In Qabala we find many mysteries and techniques for en lightenment. Like any system of theosophy, the Qaba la's purpose is to account for humanity's relation to th e Divine, and to create a personal, living relation ship with that divinity."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The main tools (or methods) applied by the Qabalist include concentration, visualization, ritual, medi tation, and contemplation of the Tree of Life. The circuit of t his \"Tree\" is the most important symbol in the Qaba la, and posits a series of \"heavens\" (or discrete yet synergetic sta tes of consciousness) which can be accessed by the aspirant. This Tree describes the descent of creative energy into manifestation, (in a primordial move God begin s to turn outwards, to unfold, to exist), and the Path of Ret urn to divine existence. The downward arc of phenom enal creation is answered by an ascending arc of evolving conscio usness. The Tree of Life represents the soul of man kind and the essence of the Universe. It is the guiding model fo r the homeward-bound soul; a consciousness map for the inner journey back to the Limitless Light. This glyph, which consists of 10 Spheres and 22 Pat hs, has long been associated with the Way of Initia tion. Qabala is a mystery school whose secrets are only transmit ted orally and experientially. Because these secret s require maturity, deep commitment and personal experience, and God's grace, they are always \"safe\" from the pr ofane. The diletante or dabbler will never \"get it.\" It requir es \"being there.\" The Tree is a compendium of symbolism describing al l ways of being and becoming; of forms, images, and ideas. It is a system of correspondences, associating diverse symbolism such as inner experiences, planetary att ributions, the Tarot, gods and goddesses, plants, jewels, animals, elements, alchemical operations, etc. Pathworking is a technical term from the Western my stery tradition. It is a method of using imaginal p rocesses to get actual experience. It is a course of meditation s which leads to the awakening of inner potentials or psychic effects, and produces outer effects in the form of synchronistic events, challenges, or growth. It is a means of conscious self-discovery and self-actualization, un folding our innate essence, \"true self\". In meditation the Qabalist concentrates on the Tree of Life and observes certain relationships. When w e concentrate on one of the Tree's symbols, our mind contacts a c osmic force and completes a transformative circuit with Universal Mind. A new aspect of the collective unco nscious is made available to our conscious minds. T he transpersonal becomes personal and finite as it man ifests within us. The practice of this meditation e ventually leads the student up the paths toward spiritual fulfillme nt and union with the Limitless Light. The application of qabalistic principles, practical Qabala, has always been called magic. It supercede s the more primal, shamanic type of magic with theurgy. Its ai m is religious or spiritual, rather than personalis tic ends, such as healing. It changes consciousness progressively, no t regressively. It leads to objective self-knowledg e. There is no loss of consciousness to lower trance states, but a n enhancement. Through syncretism (the cross-cultural melding of r eligious ideas), Qabala became more than a system o f Jewish mysticism. It is the basis of the Western Occult Tr adition and Hermetic Philosophy. Practical Qabalist s use the teachings to transform their lives, using many of t he techniques adopted by modern psychology. In fact , many of the ancient mystic arts were the traditional equivalent s of contemporary science. If you embark on a self-directed program of growth, how do you know how to program your transformation s? How will you achieve a balanced or equilibrated growth pattern, making sure your rational and emotional se lves mature at a harmonious rate? Who or what will be your guide? How will you avoid overemphasizing your strong poin ts, and how can you identify your psychological blind spots , or guide yourself through your own fears? Both Jungian psychology and the qabalistic teaching s include a depth analysis of the personality, and its subsequent reintegration on a higher level of organization. It means the deconstruction of the rigid old ego, its liquification, and subsequent spiritual rebirth. This requires maturit y, and both disciplines recommend waiting until aft er age 40 to begin in earnest. Before this age outer activities such as career and family often take rightful prece dence. But many must begin sooner because they are called to the Pa th early. Both systems employ the study of symbolis m and archetypes, creative visualizations, guided imagery , journal work, and meditation. Both seek the actua lization of an integrated personality, known as self-realization. However, Qabala transcends the realm of psychology and the mind; it seeks to use the trained psyche or soul as a vehicle for God-realization. Hence, its emphasis on purification and discipline of the mind and body i n service to the soul. This is the task of mystical meditation, whos e goal is beyond the realm of the mind. The transpe rsonal goal is valued more highly than the personal sacrifice whic h is a condition of success in this endeavor. Yet Q abala is a \"householder's yoga\" which need not take us away fr om worldly life and our duties. We can integrate both ancient qabalistic and modern psychological teachings into our daily lives. Qaba la adapts to the continuing changes of contemporary society sinc e it not a dogmatic, historic curiosity whose myste ries are frozen in antiquity. Rather, it is a living science of the soul, an evolving system of spiritual devel opment accessible to anyone with a desire for higher knowledge and de pth experience. The Qabala is a blueprint of a holistic lifestyle. It is a way to tie your various studies together, r elating them to each other, and enabling you to understand each more com pletely. It is also a useful guide and objective me asure of your personal growth."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Dion Fortune defines Qabala as \"an attempt to reduce to diagrammatic form every fo rce and factor in the manifested universe and the soul of man; to correlate them to one another and reveal them spread out as a map so the relative positions between them can be seen and the relation s between them traced. . .a compendium of science, psychology, philosophy and theology.\" We might add that the Qabala encodes a maximum amou nt of information in a minimum number of graphic elements, i.e. spheres, paths, nu mber/letters, and colors. It is a universal code. Israel Regardie calls the Qabala, \" a trustworthy guide leading to a comprehension of b oth the Universe and one's own Self.\" From Gareth Knight we hear, \" A practical method for the interrelations of variou s systems of symbols.\" For example, if you know one symbol system, say ast rology, you can readily translate it over into anot her, such as gods and goddesses, by means of the Tree of Life. Qabala, as a system of attaining direct religious e xperience, has been called a step-ladder of spiritu al growth, the Ladder of Lights. It may also be used as a study of comparative religions, with their goals mapped at the various stations. W.E. Butler termed it \"a method of using the mind in a practical and cons tantly widening consideration of the Universal soul of man.\" The methods of QBL require that the mind be tamed a nd trained and its lower desires subjugated to the higher Will. One of my favorite (slightly outdated) metaphors li kens the Qabala to a filing cabinet which contains the Universe. It functions as a filing cabinet for mental concept s, giving a place for everything within the 32 file s of the Tree. This data base can be used as a retrieval system, not on ly to contact the information you've stored there, but also that which is warehoused there from the collective uncon scious. Through it, we connect with a vast spiritua l heritage, that of previous practitioners of QBL. It brings us in touch with experiences similar to those who hav e gone before us on this Way. Regardie states that, \" the art of using our filing cabinet arrangement bri ngs home to us the common nature (or essence) of certain things, the essential differenc e between others, and the inevitable connection of all things. Moreover, and this is extremely important, by the a cquisition of an understanding of any one system of mystical philosophy or religion, one automatically acquires, when relating that comprehension to the Tree of Li fe, an understanding of every system. So that ultimately, by a species of association of impersonal and abstr act idead, one gradually equilibrates the whole of one's own menta l structure and obtains a simple view of the incalc ulably vast complexity of the universe.\" From the Qabalist's perspective, equilibrium is the basis of the work. Qabala functions as an ancient general systems, theory, allowing us to relate that which i s apparently separate. Serious students make a care ful study of the attributes of the Tree and commit them to memory. T hey function automatically as mnemonic devices to s timulate synergetic perception of reality. Jung alleged that there are gods within each illnes s or dis-ease we experience. Each archetype or godf orm has its own corresponding pathologies. When we realize that our identities are composed of various complexes ( or subpersonalities) and realize that there are differ ent mental and spiritual spaces, we are already eng aged in some form of Qabala. The Tree of Life is a map to these consciousness states, and their balancing forces. In depth psychology we find modern terms for these states of consciousness. In ancient texts we find t he names for these spaces and techniques to contact or enter the m. The map of inner consciousness unites the soul w ith the Universe. We move through this map, up the Ladder o f Lights by means of the process of progressive ide ntification with higher states, and disidentification with lowe r ones. We don't lose the lower levels, but bring t hem into a symphonic relationship with the higher ones. This i s the spiritual approach to healing dis-ease. The Tree of Life, as a graphic representation of th e creation, leads to the communion of the mundane, conscious self with both the subconscious and superconscious Self. The subconscious includes the body with its virtua l, subatomic (quantum), atomic, molecular, and genetic organizat ion, autonomic functions, and the personal unconsci ous of forgotten or repressed desires and memories--the ps ychophysical. The superconcious is the spiritual se lf or the god- within. As with all good road maps, the Tree of Life helps guide you to your destination, but the map is not t he territory. In the case of this map, problem solving, obtaining go als, and spiritual experience are the ultimate dest inations. Goal setting is a positive thing; without goals we floun der. This is the basis of becoming a \"seeker,\" and then an initiate. Initiation is only the beginning of the process. Th e imparted teaching must be applied. The ego can in itially do those things which lead to its own transcendence, but in the higher stages progress comes through God's Grac e. The Tree has various directional coordinates connec ting the spheres, called \"paths.\" The paths are tra nsitional stages while the spheres themselves may be considered disc rete states of consciousness or archetypal modes of Being, rather than Becoming. Each of the 22 paths has a se ries of exercises that strengthen, prepare, and tes t the body, emotions, mind, and spirit. A student of the Qabala does \"pathworking\" for spiritual growth. There are two major divisions to the study of the T ree of Life. The first way to approach it is philos ophical. The doctrine of the Qabala includes an elaborate concep tion of the birth of the universe, or a cosmology. It outlines"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"detailed hierarchies of entities controlling the va rious inner realms which lie between the mundane sp here of the earth and the abode of God, as unmanifest Reality. This \"blueprint of the Universe\" may be studied, an d contemplated or meditated upon. Recent investigatio ns reveal that the pattern of the Tree is implicit in the formation of all atomic elements (see The Diamond Body). It i s the geometrical basis of natural philosophy. Once we are familiar with the basic concepts we hav e the option of approaching the Tree from a practic al, experiential perspective. Here the information we l earned through study is put into applied practice. This application has been called \"magic\" from the earliest times, fr om the same root as Magi, the Mesopotamian wise men , priests and atronomers. Astrology and magic were invented a nd developed in ancient Mesopotamia. In contemporary mystical terms, it primarily indica tes the building up of multi-sensory mental images or impressions. Sometimes we must resort to sensory st imulation to engrain or reinforce these symbolic im ages. This is one value of ceremony or ritual: to set up a system for evoking psychosensory subliminal responses whi ch can transform the personality. The most basic use of the Qabala in our daily livin g is as a touchstone for solving our personal probl ems and gaining a transpersonal perspective which transcends our mu ndane life. Do your actions and choices create more karma? Do they take you closer or further away from your spir itual objectives? The effect of discrimination and better choices is therapeutic for the personality and healing for the soul. It promotes healthy self-esteem and perso nal integrity. It increases compassion, wisdom, and understanding. When the fragmentation in our personality begins to heal, we experience rebirth as a more integrated p ersonality. Once we have addressed our major psychological conf licts, the mind becomes calm enough to begin medita tion. Those who have mastered this technique are enlighte ned sages, called masters. They describe the mind a s a veil convering and encumbering the soul. This mind is seen as tied in a knot with the soul. Therefore, whatever the mind does, the soul is drag ged along. If the mind is taken outside, willy-nilly by the senses, s oul is scattered in phenomena, maya, or illusion. If the attention goes within--to the Eye Center in meditation--soul can collect and ascend to higher regions. The mind is necessary for the soul to express itself on material planes j ust as a diving suit is necessary for any prolonged stay underwater. The goal of many meditation schools is Universal Mi nd, or Brahm. But these schools may not speak of so ul, per se, although they do address its phenomena. The Tree of Life shows the dominion of mind terminating at The Abyss. The upper one-third of the Tree--the Supernal Triad --supercedes Universal Mind. It exists in an altoge her different dimension, an archetypal dimension beyond even subt le manifestation. Masters speak of entering this re alm in their meditations, once the soul is freed from the mind. But your model or worldview must include the possib ility of Reality beyond Universal Mind, or you won't even se ek it. Qabala describes four discrete aspects of the soul: 1) GUPH, the material or physical body; 2) NEPHESH, the desire body, instinctual nature, ps ychosexual self; 3) RUACH, the mental body of personality including memory, will, imagination, and reason; 4) NESCHAMAH, the soul unfettered by its mingling w ith the mind. A pure spark of divinity which has th e capacity to merge back into Godhead. Neschamah manifests in the life of the self-realize d individual. In fact, the realization is that one is indeed this being of pure light, \"I AM THAT.\" THE TREE OF LIFE & DEPTH PSYCHOLOGY We can use the Tree as a technology for connecting with Higher Power, however , we comprehend that notion or force. Using the modern language of psychology (language of the soul) as a level of communication, we can elucidate each spher e in terms of Jungian archetypes, and the various myths associated with that sphere. Briefly, we can make the following associations: #10 MALKUTH: The Seeker. Can be associated with the initation of the process of individuation or coming-to-wholeness. It is not the process itself, but the starting point. This sphere is also associated with the central nervous system and brain as the physical plane seat of consciousness. It is an aspect of personal consciousness as well as the personal unconscious. Jung speaks of psychosomatic disorders, ideomotor responses, and the archetype of the Persona or social mask;"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the archetype of the Shadow is our potential both for evil and unlived good; the archetype of the Double is our immortal counterpart. Mythic correspondences of the earthy sphere include Demeter/Persephone, earth mother and maiden bride; Gaia, primal matter; Pan, the nature god; and Hestia, goddess of the hearth, the center. Simple counseling and supportive therapy are appropriate at this phase . It means the end of denial and acknowledgement of the problem. #9 YESOD: The Dreamer. Corresponds with the moon and 'lunar' consciousness. Also known as the Astral Plane, the realm of waking and sleeping dreams, hypnosis, and twilight imagery. The level of metaphorical perception as contrasted with literal interpretation or \"acting out\" of Malkuth. Psychosexual , linked to the ego, or emotional concept of self-identity as personal and unique. Lunar archetypes include the Great Mother, White Goddess, and Virgin Goddesses. Jungian archetype is the Syzygy, or anima/animus (contrasexual aspects of self) as it relates to our love interests. Goddesses include Isis, Artemis, Athena, and Psyche; they relate either dir ectly to the moon or the woman's mysteries of cyclic death and rebirth, or transformati on of consciousness in the crucible of the emotions. This is the level of the subconscious mind and instinctual nature; passions (gland central station). Dreamwork is appropriate therapy for this sphere; psychologies which addres s this level include psychoanalysis, psychodrama, transactional analysis, real ity therapy, ego psychology, and dreamhealing. #8 HOD: The Thinker. Cultivation of this sphere brings about a rational approach to the world. Mental concepts. We learn to approach our problems in a rational manner, and so make effective decisions based on a true understanding of the issues involved, critical thinking. Corresponds with Jung's synchronicity concept of acausal yet meaningful coincidence. Analogous to Mercury, plane of intellect. Archetypes include Hermes, the alchemical Mercurius, the Trickster, and 's pirit,' as well as certain aspects of Eros as son/lover. Also the Puer Aeternus (\"ete rnal youth\"); those who remain too long in adolescent psychology; adult child syndrome; associated with strong unconscious attachment to the Mother (actual or symbolic), much like Eros held for his mother, Aphrodite. Positive traits are spontaneity and openness to change. Hermes is a god of prudence, cunning, shrewdness and sagacity; invented alphabet, mathematics, astronomy, weights and measure. A study of the psychological types of personality is effective for a rational approach to the diversity of the human r ace. Hermeneutics and analytical psychologies correspond. #7 NETZACH: The Lover. A higher aspect of the emotions which includes aesthetics and the establishment of a personal set of values and ideals based on your own personal experience and inner meaning.

A depth understanding of the feeling function as described in Jungian psychology is useful here to move from an overly dependent (codependent) attitude. Love and victory are its qualities. Mythemes relating to this level include those of Aphrodite, Circe; Orpheus; Tristan and Iseult; Guinevere and Lancelot; Heloise and Abelard. Therapies for the HOD/NETZACH level connect us with our feelings as well as thoughts and process, release, or transform. This is the level of inner child world which comes prior to spiritual rebirth; known as \"original pain\" work. Polarity Therapy, Bioenergetics, Rogerian Therapy, Gestalt Therapy, Existent ial Analysis, Logotherapy and Humanistic Psychology. #6 TIPHARETH: The Initiate. The central sphere of the Tree allows a harmonizing of the reasoning faculty with the feelings. It permits a rationa l evaluation of the worth of relationships and situations, not the emotions which are due to the activation of a complex. The abstract level of the higher mind can be developed through symbolism based on the power of the imaginative function. This is the sphere of the superconscious, and it forms the link between the spiritual nature of man and his lower self. It is the principle of integration. It is the goal of the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel in Magick; the Jungian Self. Known as Beauty, this is the sphere of self-realization. It comes spontaneously and uncontrollably in its emergent stages, then stabilizes over time, punctuated by peak experiences (as defined by Maslow). This is the level of Transpersonal Psychology. There is a shift from therapy toward spiritual discipline--notably meditation. The beginning phases are marke d by alpha bliss and inspiration. Its spiritual experience is the sense of rebir th. Its psychological models include \"self-actualization\" and the concept of high well - being. Among its archetypal expressions we find hero/heroine; the divine or magickal child; the dynamics of the puer/senex (or puells/wise old woman) whos e positive manifestations appear in the well-balanced personality; and the mana personality or wounded healer. Important solar myths include those of Ra, Osiris, Apollo, Mithras, Christ, Atti s and Dionysus. Other myths associated here are the divine marriage of Eros (H od) and Psyche (younger Aphrodite, Netzach), and the story of Ulysses (Odysseus ) with its quest to return to his original home (the theme of wounding, scaring, and healing). This sphere forms the heart of the Collective Unconscious or transpersonal bands of the psyche. The therapies which address this depth level include Jung's Analytical Psychology, Personal Mythology, Psychosynthesis, and the works of Abraham Maslow and Progoff's Process Meditation.

It is experienced as a transpersonal power which trans cends the ego, expanding your sense of \"self\" beyond that of mere ego personality. Thi s is the level of knowing the nature of your own awareness. The transcendent function is a reconciling \"third\" which emerges from the unconscious after the conflicting opposites have been consciously differentiated and the tension between them held. The Self is our inherent guiding principle, if we but listen to it. It is the central archetype of the psyche. The Self is the integrative and transformative ce nter within the psyche from which dreams, visions, and other inspirations originate. It is characterized by the union of opposites such as light and dark, male and female, good and bad. Symbols of the Self express the psychological process of coming to wholeness, and it is the essence of most spiritual experience. The Self represe nts the fullest extension and potential of an individual, and provides transcendent experiences which come from beyond one's own personal powers by divine grace. Symbols of the Self include the God-man, or \"son of God,\" the Royal Marriage or divine union; the Philosopher's Stone of alchemy, the Divine Child, the snake eating its tail, the butterfly, the ring, and the tapestry. The self also m anifests as synchronicity, or meaningful coincidence, sexual and spiritual ecstasy and absolute clarity. Other symbols include the mandala or magic circle, the temple , treasure, book, gift, bridge, star, seeds, eggs, rainbow, lit candle, and weddings. The glyph of the Tree of Life gives a firm basis for a study of the nature of man. It is a very ancient mystical symbol which represents the ten Archetypal I deas or Energies that are the manifestation of the Unknowable Mysteries. By developing in ourselves the psychological counterparts of these energies, we can become r e- integrated with our Real Self, and know our true destiny. Each sphere has ascribed to it a different aspect of the Self which is most cl osely related to the functioning of the energy in that sphere. They are closely linked and this means that a development of one characteristic will produce an effect in the other. The overall emphasis is that of balance. By identifying the different as pects of our psychological nature in this way, it is also possible to see how existing forms of psychotherapy and other growth experiences can be aligned to various paths on the Tree, according to the functions they utilize, and the spheres which are being developed.

To be able to identify these underlying archetypes, in action, we must have a means for classifying them, and dis-identifying from them. We cannot identify an archetype when we are in unconscious identification with it. If we can detach from it--disidentify--we can identify it as a sub- or superpersonality, ra ther than our personal self. This is the way to combat archetypal invasion. The archetypes we are concerned with in Qabala are by no means all the possibl e archetypes which may subsist either in the collective unconscious or Universal Mind. But they are the essential seven which pertain to magical or mystical evolution, indeed all that pertains to human life. Adding to these another three, we have all that pertains to the universe both outer and inner, both cosmic and microcosmic, as seen by humankind. Speaking both physically and metaphysically, we can perceive only those phenomena which we have the faculties to perceive. These ten archetypal sources of power correspond to the 10 spheres of the Tree. Since we cannot apprehend them directly, happily there is another way of proceeding. This is the Way which magical and mystical practices have eve r followed. Each of the spheres has its counterpart within each one of us; and that counterpart is also a focal point for the power of the sphere in question. We can, therefore, work with these counterparts within ourselves--and for the greatest effectiveness this working involves the body as well as psyche- -to gain a living relationship with the powers of these archetypes. The main qabalistic exercise for awakening and balancing the powers of the Spheres is known as the Middle Pillar Exercise. It is a means of imaginally \"bringing in light.\" It harmonizes our being on the four levels: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. The exercise is first enacted with the body, li ke a ritual, to engrain it firmly in visceral and kinesthetic consciusness. Later, y ou need only visualize your astral body going through the motions, since it will be \"second nature.\" This exercise is totally safe from the psychological perspective, since it aims toward balanced growth. To work thus, by image and enactment, by calling forth within the self the effect which is to be produced in the outer world--this, from the earliest times has been the method of priest and magician, and most recently experiential psychologies. The Middle Pillar Exercise associates the spheres of the Tree with the hum an body. Kether is visualized as radiant white light above the head. Chokmah is the Third Eye; Binah is at the throat; Tiphareth glows brilliant yellow like the sun in the heart; Chesed and Geburah are left and right shoulders, respectively; Yesod i s a violet sphere at the genitals; and Malkuth centers where the feet meet t he earth."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" THE COSMIC TREE By animating the Tree within our psychphysical structure we identify with the Anthropos, the primordial cosmic Being. It unites our finite nature with the Universal consciousness. We learn firsthand that we are not separate from that, but one with it in our deepest essence. In the diagram of the Tree of Life, the highest sphere Kether is the primal a nd unconditioned source of all existence. It precipitates from the three \"negati ve veils of existence.\" In physics, this is virtual or scalar energy, the stress enegy of the vacuum potential. Kether is the initial point of positive spiritual energy in our universe, the First Cause, in whatever manner one conceives it (a sort of White Whole). It is also, to the individual person, that particular Divine Flame which is at once the source and center of one's being. Next, and proceeding from this primal Cause, come the two great spiritual polarities disignated respectively as the Supernal Father (Yang)-- creative force in action--and the Supernal Mother (Yin)--formative force in action, giving via bility to, but also necessarily in some manner constricting, the energies of the Fathe r. To the depths of the psyche, these Supernal Parents are represented by the high archetypes of Animus and Anima, in their most exalted aspects. Lesser image s of them are made manifest to the less profound levels of the personality. They may be clothed in the cultural bias of a wise old man or psychic wise woman, or with an individual bias may appear as the object of your affection in the archetype is contaminated with personal projections that more appropriately correspond with Yesod. These top three Spheres are vital to undestanding and using the Tree as a whole, although we do no magical work directly with them. They lie beyond the reach of the mind and its power to actualize our potential. The Third Sphere, that of the Supernal Mother, has however another and more accessible identity as the sphere of Saturn, the highest of the traditional planetary spheres. The power of the Mother, who is both bright and dark (as the Qabalists knew long before Freud discovered her ambivalence), is enthroned as it were behind the figure of Saturn who is ruler of primeval opulence and fecundity and of the barren rocks. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Mercury, Venus, and Luna: these, the seven traditional luminaries of astrology are represented by the third through ninth spheres. Their qabalistic characters are not entirely identical with their astrologic al influences, although Qabalistic and astrological understanding usefully suppliment one another; but the difference need not detain us here.

Our first objective in doing this is to familiarize ours elves with the primary characteristics of each sphere. This will strengthen the counterpart of each of the powers within the depths of your psyche. This is nourishing and increases your personal potential, and at the same time ensures the balanced progress of your psychological and spiritual development. Having strengthened these archetypal counterparts and enhanced your awarene ss of them, and having learned to attune yourself readily to the powers of the spheres, you will be able to draw upon the mighty resources of one or another of those powers as you require, either in psychophysical, psychosexual, and psychological exercises, rituals, meditation, or daily life. The Qabala is thus a system of relationships among mystical symbols which can be used to open access to the hidden reaches of the mind--beyond the frontiers of reason. Qabala gives us the means to penetrate the meaning behind symbolism, and pass through its interdimensional gates. It could be regarded as the mystical process in reverse. A natural mysti c will have visions by what he calls \"the Grace of God\" and then attempt to write down his experience in symbolism or analogy. He seeks the nearest approximate metaphor s in the language of the mind.

What Godel showed was how to transcend any such system of rules, as long as thos e rules themselves could be trusted.\" Roger Penrose \"Mandalogs 2520 and 108\" Syndex I & II are about the spiritual and universal beauty of numbers. They reflect the order and beauty of nature, but also of psyche. According to Jung, number unifies the physical and psychic (as in \"realm of the psyche\", not fortunetelling) w orlds through synchronicity. Jung's basic ideas about the unity of knowledge and existenc e are in principle synonymous with the Platonic tradition, alchemy, Qabala and Gnosti cism. Plato treated the end product of the evolution of mathematical concepts, (a fi xed system of idealized objects), as an independent beginning point of the evolution of the \"world of things.\" This concrete form of philosophy was determined by the natu re of Greek mathematics. These philosophies seek to reconcile the actual condition with a h ypothetical distant ideal, which expansively incorporates both personal and universal dimensions. It is an inward- oriented epistemology. By intuitive perception we can consciously reite rate the laws of Nature and mind which are equivalent to the archetypes themselves. Beli ef in the essential aspect of the mathematical as a real world, a \"last reality\" underlies the su rprising efficiency of mathematics in the natural sciences and technology. But are numbers really abstract entities existing independently o f the human mind? What is the nature of mathematical truth, and how is it translated into mathe matical knowledge? If it exists in another \"ideal world\", how can we know anything at all about t he subject- matter of mathematics? What collective criteria determines the nat ure, terms and rules of this world? In the Jungian view, numbers (like other archetypes of the collective u nconscious) are contents and patterns of behavior which are not personally acquired in exp erience but are inborn. The Platonic Forms are the objects of knowledge, which is re garded as innate. They can emerge dynamically as well as imagistically. The essential nature of t he Forms is dual: unity and multiplicity, finitude and infinitude. \"The One\" is the origin of Forms in the same way that the psyche is the origin of the archetypes."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Because they form a primary conceptual language, numbers have heavily influen ced the development of culture, philosophy and myth as well as sciences such as c osmology. 'Number is All' was the Pythagorean motto. Numbers were symbols repre senting cosmic principles. The whole philosophy of numbers came from distinction s created by the primordial division of the One into multiplicity. Because of their arche typal essence, their mode of articulation is essentially mythic and radically symbolic. Mathematics, by the very nature of its method, is an essentially Platonic pur suit. Mathematicians treat the objects of their investigations as real objects in a hypostasized space, as if they existed independently in some pure world of their own. Thus, th ey reason that the amount of prime numbers is \"infinite.\" Discussing the amoun t of prime numbers, mathematicians believe that they are discussing objects as real as colle ctions of things in their everyday life. We use numbers casually and rigorously as a language to order space. Since ancien t times, their archetypal dynamics have been the foundation of philosophy, religious, an d artistic thought. Patterns of dynamic energy in numbers reflect patterns of natur e--the order of the universe. Whether they actually form the basis of the universe is the subject of ongoing debate among many schools of mathematicians. The qualitative distinctions w e make between phenomena are fundamentally numerical. We still don't know wh y the universe appears to follow mathematical laws. However, as Hilbert has suggested, we do know that the idea of the Infinite deviates significantly from the situation i n the physical Universe. Are numbers and functions the inventions of mathematicians, or do they exi st independently of us? Just because a mathematical object can possibl y exist doesn't mean it actually does exist. Yet, mathematicians imagine they are talking about real objects, whe n they may be talking about stabilized concepts. The new direction in the philosophy of mathematics is a \"quasi-empirical approach that treats mathematics a s just another messy experimental science.\" A partially unconscious process of idealization ends in the stable concept of numbers, points, lines, spheres. When working in geometry, a mathematician does not investigate the relations of real things. He investigates some idealized, fixed notion of these relations. Thi s notion is subjectively treated as \"reality\" without any fundamental reality beh ind it. It can, therefore, arguably be considered art as well as science. In practice, m athematicians jump to conclusions, and after the jump has been made begin the labor of proving t he theorem or constructing a coherent theory. This involves subconscious reasoning, tenac ity, focus, judgement, concentration, elementary intuition, free association, and conc eptual visualization. Some say mathematics is a purely human construct, an artifact of our nervous syst ems and culture. Others attest that even chimps and infants are hard-wired b y evolution for arithmetic to deal with real objects in the real world. Numbers are n ot Platonic ideals but neurological creations. Integers, like colors, are artifacts of our sensory proc essing mechanisms. Dehaene traces the arithmetical model to the inferior p arietal cortex. This poorly understood location is where visual, auditory, tactile signals, and language processing converge. Mathematics, or at least mathematical notation, is anot her human languge.

The concept of natural numbers is a fixed model, an idealization of quantit ative relations which ends in stable concepts of numbers. The dynamics of those numbe rs are described in number theory. Number theory, one of the oldest branches of pure mathemat ics, concerns elementary properties of primes, divisibility among integers, the exis tence of greatest common divisors, the study of specific families of numbers, simple r ecurrent relations, factorization, and more. Syndex addresses these aspects with easy to state conj ectures which can be understood and observed in graphics without any particular mathematical training. Mathematical Platonism concerns the investigation of fixed or self-c ontained models. The Platonic Idea or Form is essentially an unchangeable form. As symbols, num bers express the particular in the universal, the eternal in the finite. They expres s the ordering function of their archetypal nature. The Neoplatonists assumed an a priori structur e of knowledge grounded in archetypal forms and directed toward a unification of the ultim ate principle of \"the One\" with the diverse phenomena of \"the Many.\" This could also app ly to the number field. We contend that the Holotomes are such self-contained models of holisti c, self-reflective, finite portions of the number continuum. Holotomes are geometrically s ymmetrical, modular unities, based on the minimal numbers divisible by the the maxim al factors of division.

Each holotome contains a rational section of a complete cycle. In these geometri cal entities, the prime numbers are distributed in perfect radial symmetry within the context of every holotome. Such closed loops of causation are 'objective,' i.e. considered legi timate objects of scientific scrutiny. Number and geometry are two ways of expressing the same set of ratios or relation ships. The Exemplary 9/11 Basewave (Cycloflex) is also a synergetic, dynamic representat ion of objective closed loops of causation. They can not only be described, but also graph ically displayed. This is a reflexive +4, -4 ambidirectional base wave with a ninth n ull event, (as per Buckminster Fuller), forming a series of octaves running through th e continuum. This octave is a cyclic function. This base wave can be faithfully mapped into a s ingle coherent syntactic time frame. The base wave is highlighted by palindrom es and transpalindromes (the reverse identity of any number over a single digit , i.e. 16 - 61).

Syndex reveals the self-reflexive, synergetic prop erties of the base-10 natural number continuum or field. It simply exists at the level of nodes and mappings in the Syndex diagrams. Syndex graphically displays formerly undiscovered symmetries in the nat ural number sequence and distribution of primes. It is based on a series of circular unities (self- contained objects), the results of prime number multiplexing, from whose factors cascade the whole panoply of ancient “sacred numbers” of many diverse cultures. These sacred numbers come from the ancient wisdom traditions, in cluding those of Sumeria, Babylonia, Egypt, the Bible, Plato, Pythagoras, ancient India, Stonehen ge, the Mayans, and Qabala. Their importance to human culture echoes down to us from th e past, not in any occult way, but by disclosing an ancient number canon that conceals an d reveals inherent rhythms in the base-10 continuum. It reveals a synergetic rel ationship between number and geometry, which can be displayed graphically and easily unde rstood even by the nonmathematical. These circularities are based on prime number multiplexing. Within each circular number wheel, the primes are dispersed in rational, symmetrical deployment. T his mandalic science helps us visualize facts about dynamic aspects of the interaction of num bers and their families. This fact remains undiscovered in classical number theor y, and is discussed under the rubric of the prime number enigma. The Auric Key to this enigma is the rediscovery of the original program of the alphanumeric system of notation and the fundamental platform of general sci ence, the history of which began with horizon-based astronomy and cosmology in Sumeria. The Auric Key excavates many vital properties of numbers."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" \"Bob and Iona's Adventures in SUM AREA\" Classical cultures are characterized by certain basic ideas, of which m etrology is foremost. Ancient metrology was a system of interlinked measures, numerat ion, astronomical cycles, and geodetic standards. We can find the most often cited numbers of ancient metrology extrapolating out of a certain numerical sequen ce, (The Holotomic Sequence). We begin with the question of why some unknown and ancient geometer sel ected 360 degrees for dividing the celestial sphere and the circle. The division of 360 by 12 produced one of the first historical cosmologies--the Zodiac. The basis of t his standard of circular unity can be deduced. 360 is divisible by all eight base digits except the number 7. To include 7 as a divi sor, the prime circular module must be raised to 2520, the Auric Key, the lowe st number divisible by all base digits. From this clue, we can destrapolate and extrap olate an essential sequence, a family of numbers. It turns out that 360 is but one in a strategic series of circular unities bas ed on prime number multiplexing. Numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are the first primes. By starting with 6 (the first perfect number) and multiplying by the primes in their natural order, we get the sequence 12, 24, 72, 360, 2520, 27720, 360360, 6126120, etc. Each of these numbers forms a geometrical entity, a circular unity, (Holotome). T hese numbers just happen to be the exact sequence of minimal sums that accom odate the maximal amount of factors of division. Their synergetic qualities have remain ed unnoticed in classical number theory. This minimalism is reflected in Syndex number theory. The first conc ern of Syndex method is to encode the maximum information expressed through minimal grap hic elements. Therefore, we employ correspondences between numbers, co lors, and frequencies of divisibility to integrate the system. The number 2520 is the Auric Key. It, not 360, is the first number divisible by all nine base digits. It is exactly twice the number 1260, a number referred t o cabalistically five times in the Book of Revelations (12:6 and 12:4). It is half of the number 5040, which figures prominently in Plato’s “Laws” regarding his ideal city/state. This number 2520, more than 360, captures nature’s cyclic behaviors. And the graphic number wheel (synchrograph or mandalog) based on this number rever ses to form a mirror image of itself at the midpoint of 1260. The real key involves the sequence in which prime numbers naturally occur in the base-10 contin uum. This synergetic effect is demonstrated by multiplying the third an d fourth Holotomes together: 72 x 360 = 25920, a number given for the Precession of the Equinoxes in Sumerian cuneiform records.

The real key to this system involves the sequence in which prime numbe rs naturally occur in the base-10 continuum: 72 x 360 = 25920 divided by 2 = 12960; divided by 3 = 8640; divided by 4 = 6480; divided by 6 = 4320. 72 + 360 = 432. The precessional number, 25920, can also be arrived at by 432 x 60 = 25920, employing the Sumerian sexagesimal system. This number relates direct ly to ancient Hindu cosmology and divine time measurement as the Ages and Yugas. Their numbers (without the cosmological zeros) include 432, 864, 1296, 1728, 4320 for the Yugas , and 648, 1296, 1944, 2592, 6480 for the Ages. Both Ages and Yugas share the number 1296 (36 2 ). The Hindu systems are based on multiples of #108 (3 x 36), the divine numberword OM, also known as the number of the Universe. The Yugas and Ages can also be generated on multiples of 36. Multiply by 12, 24, 36, and 48 for the Yugas; and 18, 36, 54, and 72 for the Ages. 12960 (half the Precessional cycle) is a numerical basis for astronomical meas ures and played a role in Plato's mystic symbolism: 12 x 2160 (Platonic Month) = 25920 (Platonic Year). In all cases, the historical precedent for this system comes from Sumeria, and its ancient cosmology inspired by horizon-based astronomy. These numbers and their importance come from direct observation of the prec essional cycle and orbital times of the planets. Ancient India raised mathematics and astronomy to a fine art. In medieval ti mes, it gave the west its system of so-called Arabic numerals, the base-10 system, plac e value, and the zero, and created a Renaissance in art and science. It is within this system of mathematical notation that the +4, -4 basewave inherent in the contin uum can most easily be seen through the mechanism of palindromes and transpalindromes.

The sum of the Yugas falls at 2/3 of this axis. 6480 divided by 3 = 2160, the Platonic Month; 12 x 2160 = 25920, Platonic Year. On this graph the four-digit palindromic sequence (1881, 2772, 3663, 4554) appears in quadratic array, where only chaos exists in classical number theory. Jung asserted that number forms the particular element which unit es the realms of psyche and matter. It is real in an archetypal, qualitative sense and a quantitat ive sense, uniting the imaginal and the physically knowable. The psychic dynami cs of the concept of number appear archetypally as its \"transgressive\" aspect i n the realm of matter. Numbers above the threshold of consciousness appear as quantitative discontinuities and qualitative individual numbers.

A SYNERGETIC PERSPECTIVE ON NUMBER DYNAMICS IN THEORY (NUMERONOMY) & PRACTICE (SYNCHROGRAPHICS) by Robert Marshall with Iona Miller, copyright, 199 8 A GRAPHIC NUMBER THEORY FOR THE MILLENNIUM Abstract: SYNDEX identifies and demonstrates various properties of the base ten number field, such as the symmetrical distribution of prime numbers. The continuum can be viewed as both progressive and regressive. The key to the comprehensive analysis of general number behavior is found in the concept of \"circular unity.\" Synchrographics has been systematically contrived t o formally illustrate behavioral patterns that have successfully led to a general underst anding of the fundamental elements of the geometrical nature of the base ten system. The graphic importance of the Holotomic Sequence is that circular symmetry is being conserved and may be enlisted as the fundamental reference key in the graphic investigation of number behavior. The primes are deployed in symmetrical interface only within these specific Holotomic domains. Here, the enig ma of prime number distribution has been solved. Synchrographics regards symmetry as a primary analytical aspect of reference, making the Syndex archetypal system of classes of numbers possible. The foundation of this system is palindromes and transpalindromes, yielding 12 classes of number. Palindromes, or binomial reflection numbers are neither purely accidental nor without significance. Transpalindromes are the reversal of any particular number exceeding a single digit (for example, 16 and 61). Numeronomy , the laws relating to the essential structure and dynamics of number, is a new word for an extremely ancient science. This science, (based on the knowledge that the continuum contains a definite structural order with general laws that describe the nature of that order), has laws that relate to the gene ral behavior of nature itself. Each number has both a geometrical and numerical"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"identity. It is the outcome of Synchrographics: numbers speak for themselves through structure and behavior. The first concern of Synchrographics is maximu m information expressed via minimal graphic elements. Correspondences, such as those between geometry, numbers, colors, and frequency of divisibility form an integral part of the system. All mandalogs (number wheels) are the product of the systematic generation of the exact sequence of minimax factorization. They have the perfect retrogra de feature by which the patterns generated in the first half of the spiral ar e reversed at midpoint and are reflected as a mirrored image in the second half of the spira l. Comprehending the universal nature of the transpalindromic function of number behavior is not easy. We tend to see the number chain as a unidirectional continuum, which is too linear for a synergetic perspective. Revisioning the number continuum with the concept of simultaneous counterflow yields a more accurate picture. Remember, this is also happening in Post-quantum Physics under the rubric of quantum backflow. With large spans of number, the complex interrelationships become difficult to visualize without good graphics. Because of the octave nature of the base cycle there cannot be more than four consecutive transpalindromic pairs in a single symmetrical sequence, regar dless of the amount of digits in each individual number. We cannot contemplate numeracy without an automatic involvement with geometry. A triangle is an expression of the number three and a square is an expression of number four, i.e. number and geometry are two sides of the same coin. Therefore, Synchrographics was contrived to analyze the geometrical properties of number and conversely the numerical properties of geometry. In the proceedures that will be explained in the text, we discovered the key sequence (Holotomic Sequence) which consists of a series of key numbers or circular unities in the rhythmic wave. Buckminster Fuller was very excited, and \"filled with joy\" over these re velations, and we hope you will be also. After all, numbers are what they are, not what we wish them to be. They will not do what they cannot do, i.e. show symmetries where none exist. Nor can they hide their inherent qualities forever from the astute devotee. Using a general systems theory approach, we employ metaphors from many disciplines to demonstrate how this perspective can be employed in other fields of investigation. \"2520 Mandalog\" DEDICATION to EROS... and CHARIS..."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Electra... and Tesla...

February 11, 1980 Dear Mr. Marshall: Thank you for your letter and support material on the mandala and the use of prime number 7 in circular unity. As you know, I have a great deal about that in SYNERGETICS number 1, but even more in SYNERGETICS, number 2 on page 460. I couldn't have been more interested in those pictures. The final number which is then the product of all the prime numbers up to 50 which takes care of all the numbers which occur in trigonometry plus the series of second power of all the numbers to fifty are unique and turn around at fifty to return to zero and vice- versa. There is a basic wave running through the second powering of all numbers up to 50 and return(ing) to zero. The wave series (see Column 3, pg. 768, SYN. 1) is 24 integers long. I'm confident that the circle consisting of the 71-integer number shown on page 460 is the number employed by Universe as the comprehensive circular unity by virtue of which all interoperation of all numbers will always come out in whole rational results. I'm including a xerox of the way in which I arranged that number which discloses considerable symmetry in its componentation.

Plato does not say why he is concerned with the number twenty five twenty, but it is easy to discover as the product of the conventional 360 degrees of a circle being multiplied by the prime number 7, the circle's 360 degrees having included the first three primes to wit, two and three and five, wherefore omission of the seven in the inherently octaved pythagorean physical demonstrations of musical note progressing of tensed strings rendered inherently all irrat ional. The cyclic calculating referenced to the Babylonianly adopted 360 degrees as the comprehensive quotient of nature's cyclic behaviors. Your cyclic synchrographing work clarifies and simplifies this whole ma tter to an epochal degree. I am assuming that you have read both volumes of SYNERGETICS, else you would not have sent the exciting three pages of your work to me, which could not have been as easily accomplished--if at all--without the advent of the electronic computer--the number of calculations involved in exploring each intuitive insight being possibly too much to be accomplished in the long hand method of the B.C. world (Before Calculator).

Thomas of the University of Connecticut: \"The tension that lies with any sacred science is the same as tha t faced by the mystic: in describing the mystical state it is necessary to split unitive experience into the phenomenological and culture. Whatever unitive visions we are given or are able to attain, sacred inquiry must deal with this crucial tension. Phenomenology refers to the world as perceived by the individual. In the post-modern, constructivist world, there is no assurance that there is an isomorphism (matching) between one's perception and objective Truth-out-there. The way we create our"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"phenomenal world is through the stories we tell, both to others who we are, and for ourselves to learn who we are. The narrative reality that we create is t he construction of our reality. ...Such extreme relativism touches on philosophical solipsism 'there is no reality out there beyond my perception.' As exciting as this position may be, and perhaps needed to move beyond our encrusted practices and traditions, such an epistemological position does not make for viable community life...Culture represents the shared reality of a community. Our narratives are not just soliloquies we recite to ourselves; they are crea ted in dialogue with our fellow story-tellers. If there is no community of others, we are lim ited to monologue; without dialogue, we literally don't know who we are. In terms of science, we need community confirmation of our stories, and our creati on of meaning. Science requires Popper's check of publicity, so it can be judged by the community of scientists as to its adequacy. And for a MANDALIC SCIENCE, it i s required that those who do the judging be adequate to this task...These parameters are also necessary for phenomenology, when it deals with the 'profane' level of sci ence and education. They apply equally to the area of the 'sacred' or 'mandalic' sc ience. For this sacred science, we would agree with the steps that Reason (1993) has sugge sted for 'knowing:' Experience, Representation, Understanding and Engagement. Of the se four phases, only the third, Understanding, depends primarily on our left brain, rational formulation. The other three draw upon other reservoirs of knowing, from the intuitive to the ecstatic to the kinesthetic. It is with these other modes of knowing that we must grapple, as we seek to understand and transform human consciousness, through our research and education. And even the cognitive mode of Understanding will require stretching, by means of paradox and non- linear formulation, if we are to do justice to the demands of a sacred science.\" CONCEPTUAL GEOMETRY In SocioEconomic Synergism, A. Nicholas Frank makes the importance of synergy and synergetics in understanding the Universe and Nature clearer. Conceptual geome try explains the nature of reality (tetrahedral) and the relationships among p arts. Synergy is a holistic science. Synergy is the metaphysical self-organizing order and intelligence that resides in every part and particle of the Universe. Synergy explains the powerful creative pr ocess that drives evolution. It explains the reciprocating , working principle among components and how two parts or particles joining, can create the more--than the-sum-of-the-pa rts surplus and the emergence of qualitative gain. Synergy also explains why natural sele ction favors systems with synergetic economy--doing the most with the least of resources . The synergetic process provides a rational and logically understandable model b y which the Universe was created from seemingly nothing, and evolved to its present com plexity."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This model is reproducible in human affairs and we can use it for social transforma tion toward sustainable human habitation of our planet. We can trace the roots of the influences shaping western civilization back to the Gr eek philosophers of more than two millenniums ago. The atomists proposed that one has to deconstruct all things to find the indivisible building block in order to understand nature. At the the opposite end, the holists believed that a system, indeed the universe, has to be understood as a whole, undivided, in order to preserve its holistic quality. Western culture and science has embraced the atomistic view in near complet e ignorance of the teachings of the holists. Steeped in the atomistic mind-set, science an d the modern world developed along the reductionist line highly specialized and deeply fragme nted. Nature on the other hand speaks the language of holism or synergism. In the language of synergism every part and particle in the Universe is intelligent--it \"kno ws\" its atomistic structure as well as its emergent holistic quality. This cosmic intellig ence is what enables simple parts and particles to come together in self-organization to build an evolving and complex Universe. Science has discovered nearly all the parts and particles of the physical wor ld. We are nearly fluent in the language of reductionism, but we do not speak or understand synergism. We are insufficiently prepared to manage our existence as compl ex living organisms dependent on a very complex life support system. The only instrument that can possibly handle this job is our consciousness. And the only tool we know that is capable of rational probing of both physical and conceptual/ metaphysical events is the synergetic tetrahedron. Synergetic tetr ahedron is an instrument of rational exploration. The synergy code is carried by the physical laws of Nature. Infinities are self-contradicting, and not natural. Nature has limits and boundari es in all aspects, physical and conceptual (metaphysical). Smallness, largeness, s peed, space, time, and everything else has limits. The cosmic building code, on the other hand, is uniform and unchanging. It is tetrahedronal in its conceptual geometry, and while it is able to organize matter , it is metaphysical in essence. The cosmic building code is the synergy code whic h operates in the physical and metaphysical dimensions. It is a metaphysical wave wi th reciprocity potential. The physical world is organized by an order which, by the virtue of its orderlines s, is intelligent. Ordered intelligence is a force since it is capable of org anizing matter. If it is a force, but not physical, it must function in a metaphysical dimension of its own."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Read this book forward and backward.

FOREWARD UNORTHODOXIES: Most mathematicians have had the following experience and those whose activities are somewhat more public have had it often: an unsolicited letter arrives from an unknown individual and contained in th e letter is a piece of mathematics of a very sensational nature. The writer cl aims that he has solved one of the great unsolved mathematical problems... The writer of such a letter is usually an amateur, with very little t raining in mathematics. Very often he has a poor understanding of the nature of the problem he is dealing with, and an imperfect notion of just what a mathematical proof is amd how it operates. The writer is usually male, frequently a retired person with leisu re to pursue on his mathematics...Very often the correspondent not only 'succeeds' in solving one of the great mathematical unsolvables, but has also found a way to construct an antigravity shield, to interpret the mysteries of the Gre at Pyramid and of Stonehenge, and is well on his way to producing the Philosopher's Stone. This is no exaggeration. If the recipient of such a letter answers it, he will generally find him self entangled with a person with whom he cannot communicate scientificall y and who exhibits many symptoms of paranoia. One gets to recognize such correspondents on sight, and to leave their letters unanswered, thus unfortunately increasing the paranoia. Davis and Hersh, The Mathematical Experience (1981) For the past 30 years I have made an in-depth study of the so-called BASETEN NUMBER CONTINUUM through an innovative system of graphics that is capable of illustrating the interrelationships existing between the chai n of number and the elemental aspects of geometry -- specifically that which we call CIRCULAR UNITY. The beauty of the graphic Syndex Theory is that the proofs are easily seen and understood, even by the nonmathematician. This is not an abstruse backroad of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"mathematics, but a graphic description of number laws, which can easily be understood by small children. Because I have invented my own syntax does not make me a crank. Because I have had some difficulty since new paradigms are not readily embraced in science, does not make me a paranoid to be summarily dismissed. I present no prophecies, no eschatology, no divine number theories (even though commenting on why they were so considered). Sometimes, useful new ideas come from highly unlikely sources. The discipline, called SYNCHROGRAPHICS, has pointed out an exemplary BASEWAVE that occurs through the interaction of square number NINE and the first palindromic prime: ELEVEN. This exemplary \"wave cycle\" initially culminates at 99 or 9 x 11. It is then referred to as the NINELEVEN CYCLOFLEX: The first four multiples reverse at 49.5 and go retrograde to 99. The multiples, then, of 99 do the same and so on forever. Thus, we find four forward and four reverse event octaves with a ninth null event, as per the suggestions of of R. B. FULLER in SYNERGETICS II, regarding the way nature functions dynam ically. I contend there is absolutely no mathematical error in my findings, which I c ame upon without the aid of computers. By experimenting with a series of graphic depictions of number arrays, I FOUND THE RATIONAL BASIS OF PRIME NUMBER DISTRIBUTION. These experiments in what I call SYNCHROGRAPHICS lead to the observation of two manifestations: #1 The sequence of minimal sums that accommodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors, called the HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE, each of which demonstrate a half positive, half negative symmetrical and harmonious octave CIRCULAR UNITY when expressed in a synchrographic MANDALOG. #2. A total explanation for the behavior or distribution of PRIME NUMBERS as a totally rational order. This is something most leading math experts consider unlikely. Most current ideas regarding number theory are based on the new science of chaos theory. At the moment we are in search of a math writer who can help explain and upgrade these renderings. This is (arguably) the most significant discovery in physio-mathematical epistemography (Fuller's term) in the industrial e ra. In my correspondence with him, Bucky Fuller assumed that I relied heavily on electronic computation to achieve what I have, but nothing could be further from the truth. That is what makes it so amazing it was not discovered before. My major source of insight has been the graphic enspiralment of two ancient Hindu systems of calendaric/astro nature. The first was a spiral of #108, the Hindu"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"number of Om and the Universe, and basis of the Ages and Yugas. I discovered the 9/11 wave cycle on this Synchrograph C number wheel. The number spiral of Holotome E, (2520), clarifies the essential necessity of the regard of RETROCITY as the primary element in number behavior, as it graphically reveals the reflection sequence. The HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE is represented as follows, with the primes as mutipliers in their natural order: TWO TIMES SIX = 12 : A x 2 = 24 : B x 3 = 72 : C x 5 = 360 : D x 6 = 2520 : E x 7 = 27720: F x13 = 360360: G x17 = 6126120: H etc... The growth rate of this sequence will be of great interest to mathematicians. It is seen as slightly deficient in that after the 9th example the number of integers, i n a seemingly erratic fashion, skips a number. In this way the tomes slightly sh rink as they grow. This suggests a finite end where a number can be reached that will be divisible by all previous numbers: an OMNISYNCHRONISTIC MODULE so to speak. It would be a massive, yet perfect number. Perhaps it is God's unlisted phone number... The major error in all systems that attempt to analyze the behavioristics of the usually so called baseten system of quantitative notation begins with the confusion of the term \"NUMER ONE\" with the term \"UNITY.\" If we regard the term number one as SINGULARITY (as Fuller did) and give t his idea no direct analogy to those idea-entities that we refer to as numbers, or t hose base digits that are divisible into discrete sectors, then we realize that one is not a number which leaves us with exactly EIGHT BASE DIGITS: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9... The most revolutionary concept in regards to the term UNITY that has been suggested in the past 6000 years of physio- mathematical epistemography is the proposition suggested in the late R. Buckminster Fuller's definition of the term unity as a distinctly plural term. In SYNERGETICS II, there exist two def initions which could suggest an element of paradox or ambiguity but in point of fact denotes that UNITY CAN EXIST AS A SERIES OF DISCRETE CLASSES OF PLURALITY. QUOTATION A: \"Unity is plural and at minimum twofold.\" This suggests the unification of a pair of singularities..."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"QUOTATION B: \"Unity is plural and at minimum sixfold.\" This suggests the unification of a harmonious set of a rational interrelationships of whole factor base digits. This involves the classic attitude that six is the firs t perfect number in that one plus two plus three equals six, or that six is the sum of its first three integers. Even though one is not a number it can still be a part of a true number. These two definitions of the term unity, even though they seem simplistic are of epochal significance to the syntax of quantitative notation. Without this critic al distinction of the different classes of numerical articulation, the true behavi or or structure of the numerical continuum cannot be coherently acknowledged in a logical perspective. The quasi-chaos encountered by those engaged in the theory of numbers or any other form of analyzing the distribution of prime numbers in terms of rational order has usually been an approach based on the belief in a \"base wave\" in the continuum that would reveal a pattern of relationships between two kinds of number: primes and composites. Also, it was thought, even though not specifically stated, that this hypothetical base wave would manifest as a rhythmic sequence revealed by cataloging sequences as per Neil J. Sloane of Bel l A.T. & T. Labs at Murry Hill, New Jersey. What is missing in the sequence approach which would require symmetry in any kind of proof is that numbers per se have never been properly classified beyond a two-fold system of primes and composites. The full wave band of number classification (which I tag and clarify with TWELVE GLYPHS in this introduction to SYNDEX) is based upon the idea of the TRANSPALINDROMIC FUNCTION in the continuum of natural number. The validity of this approach to the analysis of number behavior is predicated on the simple observation that all previous studies of number have ignored the fact that any series of diversified entities, real or imaginary, can be viewed a s both a graduating series AND a retrograde series. It has been the retro grade aspect of the numeric continuum that has been habitually ignored like many other forms of tradition. As a special example, #16 is the ONLY 2-digit square, out of 90 candidates, that is a prime number when reversed, (61 is a prime). This we call a retrograde prim e square and assign this class with the glyph: . Altogether there are only TWELVE PERMUTATIONS possible to the ambiclassification of all possible numbers. As we go along, it will become cl ear that some such system was known in extreme antiquity. The zodiac is but one example. In regards to prime number behavior this ambidirectional, or transpalindromic system of number regard is essentially mandatory. By regarding the continuum of number in only one direction, number symmetry is compromized."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The other aspect of this system of number classification that requires notice i s the fact that SYMMETRY REQUIRES A FINITE COLLECTION IN ORDER TO BE SEEN AT ALL. An open-ended series or infinite collection (a contradiction of terms itself) cannot produce symmetry. Nor can we expect to find symmetry i n an arbitrarily chosen collection. What is needed are discrete levels of finitude . This is where the HOLOTOMES come to the rescue. The Holotomes are examples of CIRCULAR UNITY that are non-arbitrary but generated by spec ific logic contained in the continuum itself. These finite and symmetrical NUMBER MODUALS (dual modules) are generated by the natural order in which the primes occur and represent the minimal numerical magnitudes that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive divisors. The series begins by doubling the first perfect number: SIX, which produces 12 as the first true Holotome. Thereafter, we multiply each resultant sum by the next prime in its natural order of occurrence: HOLOTOMES Two Times Six = 12 : A x 2 = 24 : B x 3 = 72 : C x 5 = 360 : D x 7 = 2520 : E x 11 = 27720: F x 13 = 360360: G x 17 = 6126120: H etc. Through this process, we produce a sequence of FINITE AND NON- ARBITRARY NUMBER MODUALS that may be represented in a geometrical format that demonstrates the rational and totally symmetrical distribution of PRIME NUMBER ORDER. For a number of years I was plagued with the paradox of how the Holotomes were connected as a continuum and yet separated as discrete, finite, and symmetric al entities. I finally found the answer to this dilemma which gives me full confi dence as the proper solution. It is this phase of the present document that will produce the greatest difficulty in the communication of the final and exquisite answer. It is the CYCLOFLEX, the EXEMPLARY 99 OCTAVE CYCLE, that produces the continuity while it is the finite nature of each of the Holotomes that produces the discontinuity. How this occurs is through the same function of cycloscillating retrocity tha t creates the warranted paradox. Each of the first few HOLOTOMES when added to the reverse of their respec tive numerical sum produces an even sub-multiple of 99:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A: 12 + 21 = 33 : 1/3 of 99 B: 24 + 42 = 66 : 2/3 of 99 C: 72 + 27 = 99 : 3/3 of 99 Therefore by a series of reversals that synchronize the EXEMPLARY 99 CONTINUUM with the finite holotomes, we have both continuity and discontinuity in a non-ambiguous paradox. The SYNCHROGRAPHS and number structure field patterns will clarify this assertion of a graphic syntax that accomplishes a clarification that words alone cannot provide to the satisfaction of the educated person. I should further remark on this issue of continuity that Richard Dedekind in his essays on the theory of numbers deals with continuity in conjunction with the straight line. I assume he was referring to a straight line in the Plat onic sense of an ideal straight line which, of course does not exist anywhere else but in the m ind, allowing that the mind is part of nature. But the continuity/discontinuity to which I refer is not related to a st raight line. To the contrary it relates to cyclations and oscillations which are curvilinear, at least as I contemplate the functions involed in the EXEMPLARY CYCLE and HOLOTOMES. The continuity/discontinuity of the Holotomes as knots on a string of the EXEMPLARY 99 WAVECYCLE is about the closest I can come to an analogy of the quasi-predicament. After all, y ou can only do with words what syntax will permit. And I am not a philosopher but merely a numeronomist (which title is not even honored with a place in the dictionary). Credit for the concise definition of Unity would include a list of people who have facilitated explication of the AURIC KEY. Most are relatively unknown souls whose names would add nothing to the substance of this material. They will recognize their input wherever it manifests itself. But he who is foremost on such a list has moved on to an alternate space of being. That specific person of major contribution is the late R. Buckminster Fuller, and the contribution referred to is his duplicate definition of unity as two-fold, sixfold, or plurality. This leads us to recognize that there are at least two classe s of unity and therefore more. The idea of a MAXIMUM UNITY is beyond the boundaries of the concepts dealt with herein, (i.e. THE OMNI- SYNCHRONISTIC MODUAL). The philosophy of number/geometry has in the past been plagued by the association of One (1) and UNITY, or the regard of ONE as a number (member)."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Both Plato and Pythagoras missed this critical distinction between one and unity . This oversight still confuses the number theorist to this later date in history. One is singularity and two is the nexus (unity) of at least two singularities o r what we refer to with the term unity. The concept of various forms of unity is a crucial aspect of NUMERONOMY. In SYNERGETICS II , I find wandering remnants of Fuller's own confusion with unity and how it relates to the null-concept of \"infinity.\" Fuller described the closepacking of thirteen spheres of equal diameter as t he VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM MATRIX. It is the symmetrical array of twel ve spheres around/about a thirteenth nuclear sphere. This nucleus can be seen as an expression of singularity....The shell of twelve which surrounds this singularity is a symmetrical unification of members that describe the profile of the V.E.M., which is the unification of squares and triangles. The closepacking of four spheres of equal diameter is a non-nucleated complex which describes the profile of a tetrahedron. In this case we have a symmetric al unity of four spheres about a null-singularity: no nucleus. Unless these distinctions are observed in our physiomathematical epistemogra phy we will encounter a problem with syntax. None of the foregoing is to be intended as a criticism of the general syntax of Synergetics II but is intended to suggest a reformation of the gospel of synergetic terminology. I worked in close parallel with Bucky during his final days and the 3rd edition of Synergetics was his foremost priority. The mistakes made in SYNERGETICS I were corrected in SYNERGETICS II , but those made there were never reconciled inasmuch as the manuscript was never completed. The oversight of primary importance concerns the exact point of turnaround in the numbers \"up to fifty,\" which will be a major item in the present document, which on this crucial account re: number behavior would proxy the missing page of the null-event SYNERGETICS III . It is a brief, simple, logical and necessary step from the concise definition of unity to the epistemographic expression of circular unity and thence to quasi-spherica l unity. You will appreciate this once you understand that ideal sphericity is not a feature of universe, which is (or Who is) Nature.

Manin, Nov., Science 85 THE PUZZLE OF PRIME NUMBERS"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Numbers are what they are, not what we wish them to be. They will not do what they cannot do, i.e. show symmetries where none exist. Nor can they hide their inherent qualities forever from the astute devotee. Well before Euclid's day, mathematicians had listed the first primes, looking for patterns or other clues to their distribution. No particular patterns are imme diately evident, except for the obvious one that all primes except 2 are odd numbers (since all larger even numbers have a factor of 2). But a closer look suggests that the primes seem to be spreading out, or getting scarcer as the numbers grow larger. For instance, there are eight prim es between 102 and 120. Further, note the gap of 13 consecutive composite numbers between 113 and 127. There is no such long gap among the first 100 numbers. (See table of first primes and table of statistical distribution). Due to inherent difficulties in mathematics and physics, these sciences have adopted the art of modelling as a working strategy. Physical theories are provisional models of reality. Mathematics itself is a model. All physical t heories are models. A model should be able at the very least to describe certain phenomena fairly accurately. A mathematical model is a complete and consistent set of mathematical equa tions, which may describe some physical, biological, social, or psychological entit y...or conceptual entity. We can substitute \"structure\" for \"equations\" when working with a non-numerical model. Some of the purposes for which models are constructed are (1) to obtain answers about what will happen in the physical world; (2) to influence further experimentation or observation; (3) to foster conceptual progress and understanding; (4) to assist the axiomatization of the physical situation; (5) to foster mathematics and the art of making mathematical models. A model may be a convenient approximation, simplistic or sophisticated. By creating models, or approximations, many researchers and philosophers think they have discovered the keys to the universe. But even if those keys open only a small chamber on the periphery, they can be highly significant in their implications. The whole object of mathematics is to create order from seeming chaos, to ext ract structure and invariance from disarray and turmoil. In banishing chaos, we seek pattern, regularity, arrangement, understanding. When it is there, we intuitivel y \"feel it in our bones.\" We can sense graphic or visual order, pattern, and symmetry in mathematics just as we do in nature. Among the integers, the prime numbers play a role that is analogous to the elements of chemistry. They are nature's building blocks, but unlike the eleme nts, the list never ends. Euclid proved that there are an infinite number of primes. Classically, the main feature of the list of primes is the absence of any notic able pattern or regularity."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The attraction of this unsolved mystery of the prime number problem is that we are able to see what is going on long before we can prove it. As in Popper's theory of scientific knowledge, we formulate a \"bold conjecture,\" not likely to be tr ue by accident. Then this conjecture is subjected to the test of numerical calculati on. If the test fails to refute the conjecture, it is strengthened--proved so to speak, in the sense of natural science. Prime numbers are the key to the required rate of grow th in the Holotomes. In physics or chemistry, experimental agreement with theory to 8th place accuracy is considered strong confirmation of the theory. The agreement is hardl y accidental, therefore, the principle by which the calculation was made must be right. In Platonism, mathematical objects are considered objectively real. In a ce rtain sense, this is the realist or Platonist philosophy. The regularity which has been predicted and confirmed is not illusory--there is something there which is lawf ul and regular. But in another way, Syndex also conforms to the constructivist dogma where genuine mathematics can only be obtained by a finite construction. THE HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE OF CIRCULAR UNITIES Confidence in the orderliness or rationality of the number system underlies all research. This realism is more than convenient; it is indispensable. Proofs are a way of understanding why and how conjectures are true. A \"wave-particle\" complementarity theory of the number field reveals a key (here termed THE AURIC KEY) to the orderly, rational distribution of prime numbers. According to Fuller, the occurance of a basic wave has the significance that despite their discrete nature numbers as integers have wave-like properties . It is a metaphysical wave with reciprocity potential. In fact, there is an abunda nce of waves occuring on all levels of numbers. Fuller demonstrates that \"...nature is always operating in her own modular system of four progressively additive, then four progressively subtractive event octaves with a ninth null event, altogether constituting an octave nine system...\" REVERSAL is the key to number law. SYNDEX THEORY is about the intrinsic structural patterns that occur in the BASETEN CONTINU UM of number. RETROCITY, as a dynamic of the number continuum, has been ignored by orthodox science. This study of the BASETEN number continuum through an innovative system of graphics is capable of illustrating the interrelationships existing betw een the chain of numbers and the elemental aspects of geometry -- specifically CIRCULA R"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"UNITY. These graphics so excited the late Dr. Fuller that he asked to inclu de them in his planned publication of SYNERGETICS III. The theoretical aspect of SYNDEX is termed NUMERONOMY; the practice or practical side is contained in the graphic depictions whose creation and employment is known as SYNCHROGRAPHICS. One of the graphic keys to NUMERONOMY is the TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE. It represents the graphic foundation of the synchronicity between geometry and number and sets the stage for the series of circular unities designated as the HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE. These geonumerical modules also represent the minimal numerical sums which accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive divisors. Each of these modules, presented in the form of a spiralic SYNCHROGRAPH, is a half positive, half negative retrograde octave wave cycle and reveals an idea l symmetrical circular unity. The HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE begins with the three ambidirectional axes of the TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE. Then by the involvement of prime numbers in their natural order of occurrence, the following series of true circul ar unities (HOLOTOMES) emerge: HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE = HOLOTOMES The HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE revolutionizes the science of descripti on by producing a GRAPHIC SYNTAX that involves all of the structural intricacies of the continuum of baseten number. The scientifically systematic discipline of NUMERONOMY via SYNCHROGRAPHICS establishes a whole new phase in GENERAL SYSTEMS LOGIC. SYNDEX is an ancient yet new wave in the realm of Physiomathematical Epistemography. It deals with a unified series of t ransfinite idea interactions in a closed loop, (IDEAL SYNTAX), sans paradox. The AURIC KEY excavates many vital properties of numbers. Its very exis tence and ultimate form hinges on numbers which occupy space. By arranging numbers in synchrographics, a dynamic number field or matrix is formed. Regarding numbers in terms of matrices or fields is important, and acknowledging that numbers have spatial qualities is vital to fully appreciating their signfic ance. Prime numbers play a fundamental role in the construction of geometric form, and in turn of structures. These structures are manifested from the microscopic to t he macroscopic, and comprise our physical reality. As far as the realizati on of the implication of numbers is concerned, a knowledge of prime numbers is crucial. SYNCHROGRAPHICS emerged from the notion that geometry and numbers are interwoven disciplines emerging from a mysterious or unified source. By isola ting"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"basic relations between number and geometry something may be learned about that source. HOLOTOME E (2520) may be considered the cornerstone to the various MANDALOGS that comprise the AURIC KEY. It reveals the pattern of compouind synchronicities that occur in the behavior of the base digits in all their permutations which end at 2520. It graphically shows 100% symmetry of prime number distribution within the context of each Holotome. The wavecycle begins near the center and spirals outwards, a process which reveals even more inherent symmetry and produces tantalizing rays. There a re seven spiral bands, each divided in 360 subsections of circular unity. (Insert picture, Holotome E synchrograph) Cycles in numbers can represent dynamic feedback processes, just as discret e numbers can represent \"things,\" entities, or quanta. In the living \"journey\" of ongoing manifestation the rigid structural elements of number may be considere d male (or yang); the complementary, dynamic cycle process (recursion) can be considered female (or yin). This cyclic process can be demonstrated in the distinction between palindromic and transpalindromic numbers. It can be graphically depicted with minimal elements in a short series of self-reflecting mandalas, revealing the f requencies and harmonies inherent in the natural number sequence, the marvelous in the mundane. The psychological mechanism that we refer to as the BASETEN concept of quantitative notation, commonly refered to as ordinary number is the ultimate foundation of the science of mathematics which in turn is the solitary foundation of industrial civilization. SYNCHROGRAPHICS Analogs with consciousness reveal the process of psychological transcendence unfolding from the O (circle-zero) of undifferentiated \"objective\" wholeness which depicts the eternal principle of universe and the inner being, or Self. Wholes can be modeled as circles, cycles, spheres, or hyperspheres. The natura l number sequence can lead our consciousness from point, to line, to plane, to multi- and hyper-dimensional representations. The SYNDEX perspective regarding the geometry of number, (and visa versa, or the interrelationship of plurality and form, including structure), is predicated upon a series of geometrical modules that involve a discrete plurality determined by the natural order of prime number occurrence. These modules, (here designated as HOLOTOMES), are the minimal amount of consecutive factors of division. They"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"display the progressive and regressive movement of the pilot-wave or pulse inherent in the number sequence. The various properties of the so-called baseten system of numerical notation have been the objects of serious study, (under differing titles), for many centuries : numerology, number theory, etc. The singular most common element of all such systems is that one cannot contemplate numeracy to any extent without an automatic involvement with geometry. The reason for this is clear: A triangl e is an expression of the number three and a square is an expression of the number four, i.e. number and geometry are two sides of the same coin. Beginning with this simple observation, the discipline of Synchrographics wa s contrived to analyze the geometrical properties of number and conversely the numerical properties of geometry. The solution to the question of how to find the most evocative points of synchronicity between the disciplines of quantitative notation and the essential expressions of geometry occurred through an observation of such simplistic proportions that it is a mystery of profound depth that even such masters as Euler and Dedekind (or anyone else, for that matter ) did not employ such thinking long ago. That a synchronetic relationship exists between the so-called baseten sys tem of numerical notation and the fundamental principles of geometry was clearly suggested by Pythagoras in his series of rectangles with whole number commensuration between specified rectangles and their diagonals. The 3:4:5 ri ght angle triangle is the initial example of triplets. That no clear mathematical progression was found that established a systemat ic serial law was the catch in all attempts to establish a synchronetic order to the distribution of such triangles of whole number commensuration. The key to the solution of this problem of Pythagorean triplets is contained in another mathematical enigma, that is, the distribution of prime numbers. The most elegant and beautiful solution to this pair of classical mathematica l mysteries has appeared through an innovative discipline labeled synchrographics which was rediscovered and redeveloped by Marshall over the past thirty years. Instead of dealing with a series of triangles or diagonally divided rectang les, SYNCHROGRAPHICS deals with a series of spirals that are generate d by numerically commensurate sums that are generated with the prime numbers beginning with half of the first Pythagorean rectangle. These sums, the HOLOTOMES, are the actual sequence of minimal numerical factors. The sequence begins with twelve as Holotome A. Its nave, or midpoint, being six, is classically referred to as the first perfect number."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The first synchrograph then, which depicts the initial Holotome is twelvefold (as is the ancient Zodiac) of six positive and six negative symbolic events, and is t he first sum divisible by four base digits: 2, 3, 4 and 6. Doubling HOLOTOME A, we get B or number 24 which is the first number divisible by five base digits: 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8... From there on we multiply each resultant sum by the next prime number in its natural order of occurrence 24 x 3 = 72 x 5 = 360 x 7 = 2520 x 11 = 27720, ad infinitum. Thereby we release the HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE from obscurit y. I will list here the four pairs of two-digit retroprimes or transpalindromic p rimes, or reversible primes, to see if I can add any signficant enhancement to thei r importance to the behavior or structure of prime numbers: 13 31; 17 71; 37 73; 79 97 and a fifth pair of near prime composites that act as a latching pair that COMPLETES THE SYMMETRY GROUP WHICH DOVETAILS WITH THE OCTAVE THAT IS FOUR POSITIVE AND FOUR NEGATIVE EVENT IDENTITIES THAT CREATES A CIRCULAR UNITY IN THE 9/11 retrograde wavecycle: (INSERT TABLE) A VERY CLEAR AND NATURALLY SYMMETRICAL THREE COLUMN RENDERING OF THIS NUMERICAL LATCHING ORDER EXISTS. The chances of this being an accidential coincidence is as likely as finding an 8 000 lb. elephant inside the nose of a mouse. Interesting in view of how the multiples of nine turn retrograde at 49.5. The same pattern continues with the 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. digit transpalindromic primes which indicates clearly that the progression of prime numbers is totally an or derly and coherent progression with no sign of disorganization, whatever. Does the Number Seven Produce an Irrational Sequenc e? Industrial civilization has been, in effect, dealing with a short deck. 360 (Holotome C) is an example of circular unity which accomodates all of the base digits except number seven. This renders physiomathematical epistomography eternally baffling, at least until SYNDEX is understood. To the traditional number theorist, SEVEN (7) appears to generate an irrat ional sequence. Several years ago, Bob Marshall came to realize that 1428571 repeating is NOT AN IRRATIONAL SEQUENCE, but that any number in this sequence added to the third following number produced nine (9): Note that the only digits not represented in the seven sequence are 3, 6, and 9, (also no zero)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THIS IN EFFECT IS GRAPHIC PROOF THAT 1428571 is A SIX DIGIT CYCLATION OF TOTAL RATIONAL ORDER.

Remember, singularity or ONE IS NOT A NUMBER. [insert Hebrew charac ter for Aleph] is Aleph, THE FOOL. When One (singularity) is divided by seven, the resulting decimal .142857 is formed, which is a six-digit cyclation. 3, 6, and 9 are the only base digits missing from this cycle, but they can be accounted for by the observation that it is a six digit cycle. Another way of viewing how 3, 6 and 9 are accounted for is that any digit in this sequence when added to the third following digit produces 9: 1428571428571428571428571 + 142857142857142857142857 9999999999999 SYNDEX THEORY AND PRACTICE As per M.-L. vonFranz's suggestion in our opening quote, we choose an interdisciplinary, general systems theory approach, finding common patterns of methods employed in a wide range of theories. We can use ontological (the science of reality; that branch of metaphysics which deals with the essenti al nature, properties and relations of things) and epistemological metaphors (\"how we know what we know\") from physics, music, and psychology to explore the relationships among numbers. We shall do that here, also adding a fourth art - metaphysics. However, the primary mode of Syndex transmission, its SYNTAX, is GRAPHIC DEPICTION. Its philosophical basis is minimalism, minimism (maximal information in a minimum number of graphic elements). From the dawn of history our species has always carefully, thoughtfully, and systematically observed nature and modelled nature. Our general world view, including our attitude to physical and mathematical aspects of basic concept s is very important. The essential truth lies in mathematics. The physical universe is an aggregate of frequencies. Mathematics has penetrated sociology, psycholog y, and linguistics, as well as many other fields. In Questioning the Millennium, Stephen Jay Gould says, \"My argument for the origin of our fascination with numerical regularity closely parallels my claims about our affinity for dichotomous classification. In part, we latch on to numerical regularity, and seek deep meaning therein, because such order does underlie much of nature's patterning. The pperiodic table, after all, is not an arbitrary human mnemonic, and Newtonian gravity does work by a law of inverse squares. But our search for numerical order, and our overinterpretations, run so far beyond what nature could possibly exemplify, that we can only posit some"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"inherent mental bias as a driving force...Our searches for numerical order lead as often to terminal nuttiness as to profound insight.\" Without equations there is nothing to talk about. Or, more properly, the mathematics enables us to talk about physical concepts more precisely. Mathematics is a form of language, a very precise form of communication. The se extremes usually compliment one another and our thinking process can move back and forth between them. Physical concepts can guide the development of new equations as well as visa versa. SYNDEX is primarily a form of insight that arises through our attempts to obt ain a perception of a deeper nature of reality as a whole. Its imaginative qual ities are as important a feature as precise math concepts. Imagination helps further the development of holistic concepts. Even in physics, play and speculation are part of the legitimate process of discovery, and in fact essential to it. These dynamic connections are a fact of nature provable by experiments; but to explain them philosophically is difficult, or rather complex. Demonstrable evidence cannot be found in a conceptual vacuum, therefore a testable theory must be assumed. Theory is a perspective, a \"Way\" of seeing. SYNDEX THEORY assumes along with R. Buckminster Fuller that unit y is plural, and also that nature manifests only in a +4, -4 wavecycle with the ninth null event. If you don't understand this, or you disbelieve it in relation to prime number dynamics, we suggest you temporarily suspend disbelief. If you don't like metaphors go directly to the number proofs and graphics. If you are math phobic, try the metaphors before tackling the math. Hopefully, one of our metaphors will speak to you. Let the experimental facts, as displayed in the graphics, speak for themselves, creating a new frame of reference. These pragmatic, positi vistic (what is physically observable is real), operational assumptions suggest a deeper connection. If nature behaves in certain fundamental ways, we can expect the dynamics of natural number, which describe those processes, to do the same. In seeking greater control over nature and a wider glimpse of cosmos man forges his thoughts into concepts. Among the vital concepts realized so far, number and its chief mode of expression geometry, coupled together, play the most crucial role i n man's technological development. Space and time can be quantified, their mutual relationship described more objectively and less arbitrarily with a firm grasp of geometry and numbers , and the subsequent description of space and time in exact terms, allows us to examine our world more thoroughly and tap the cosmic forces which govern our very lives and future. Megalithic structures, such as Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Cheops, show the great extent to which our ancient ancestors already achieved this,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"thousands of years before modern technology. The functions of these and other examples of ancient technology varied from sophisticated calendars and celes tial gauges, to temples of worship and dwellings. One common feature of them all was concise geometry and direct reference to numbers in their very structure and dimensions. Apart from these essential outgrowths of reliable calculating techniques, man has sought to harmonize the systems of mathematical insights into a single whole. Ancient mathematicians also sought to understand number on their own terms with results which often seem vague or arbitrary to the modern mind. Consider astrology, Qabalism, numerology, etc. In ancient times, numbers were also l etters. The continuum was indivisibly ALPHANUMERIC (ref. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin systems, which form the basis of the modern western occult tradition). But regardless of the conclusions drawn from these ancient systems, geometry and numbers are vital to their inner workings. And despite enormous variances in time, place, and culture, certain numbers recur so often that they cannot be dismissed as coincidence. Why does Plato relate 5040 to his ideal city-state? Why is 1260 referred to five times in the Book of Revelations, and so prevalent in music theory? Why did the Babylonians base their number system on 60 and have 360 degrees in a circle, when they knew the sun took more than 365 days to complete a yearly cycle? And further, why does 12 abound everywhere from the western zodiac, to calendars and clocks? Why are there 56 Aubrey Holes in the outer circle of Stonehenge? And why is 7 considered a sacred number in many religions? We hope to convincingly, empirically, answer some of these points. Others you may work out for yourself. The fact that these numbers relate to THE AURIC KEY may be significant. C ould it be that the systems from which these numbers derived had a common origin or basis, which is cross-cultural? There is an indication of this, founded on NUMBER LAW in itself, i.e. Numeronomy. Plato and Pythagoras both dealt with the nature of the perception of reality by using geometry as an aspect of number. Plato taught that there are changeless , eternal forms on which existing things are modeled. \"The theory of forms\" is t he most famous of all Platonic doctrines. It asserts that any object's true reality is found in its RATIONAL FORM or structure, rather than its materi al appearance . Philosophy begins in the sense of wonder coupled with the discipline of reason; its pre-geometric forms describe changes from one st ate to the next. THE SYNDEX PERSPECTIVE regarding the geometry of number, and visa versa, or the interrelationship of plurality and form, including structure, is predicated upon a series of geometrical moduals (dual modules) that involve a discrete plurality determined by the natural order of prime number occurrence ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"These moduals, designated as HOLOTOMES, are the minimal plural quantities that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. The two-dimensional representative of HOLOTOME A is a circle divided into 12 radial sections just as the Zodiac divides the celestial sphere into 12 radial constellations of thirty degrees each. Twelve also reflects the 12 Buddhist links in the chain of causality. The present document provides conclusive proof that this ancient system of a twelvefold classification of primary qualifications was by no means an arbit rarily invented system but a clearly logical discovery of the qualities and quantiti es of nature's actual scenarios. The 360 degree cyclation of this archaic celestial roadmap is also both a logical and rational quantity and quality of nature and was by no means arbitrarily determined by the processes of human cognition and conceptualization. The array of cleavage possibilities that result in the growth of crystal s follow structural laws. Likewise, the pre-geometric structural design of the atomi c configurations of individual elements also conforms to structural qualities that over the centuries have been identified and labeled according to the systematization of description we know as the alphanumeric principles of notation. Remember, in ancient times letters were numbers, although they never reached a level of universal tabulation fully translatible linguistically . In a very legitimate sense the revelations contained in this writing provide the means of a basic and universal system of describing the structural and topologica l characteristics of matter which makes no distinction whatever between iner t and organic, dead or living. The observations to be revealed declare that the universe in its so called \"infinit e entirety\" is a living being only separated from itself by the limits we impose on our imagination, which if not hindered by a misunderstanding of itself has no limits. Henceforth regarded as the SYNDEX PERSPECTIVE, the present document begins with a graphic gesture which acts as a primal foundation for an IDEAL SYNTAX which, when seen in the light of its own vision, arguably abolishes the two arch-enemies of truth: paradox and chaos. Neither of these can exist in nature, except in the province of language and modelling itself, which of course is a variable aspect of nature. The graphic gesture just mentioned is entitled the TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE or T.R.I., for short. It idffers from the Cartesian XYZ in that i t is based on the tetrahedron, rather than cube. The purely imaginary geometrical figure denotes the 3 ambidirectional axes of spatial description. But these are not the XYZ of Cartesian coordinates, but represent a dynamic tertahedral tense grity."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Altogether, these vectors represent the six minimal ways that one may move i n the omnidirectional options of spatial tropism: up/down; right/left; fore/aft. Since we cannot visit the past by the expedient of walking backwards we must concede that time is not a direction. And since we could not know if everything is expanding as space time passes, we have no reason to regard time as either a direction or dimension. Time, then, being an empirical assumption based on what we recognize as spatial movement (the past is 3D, at least we remember it that way) is a complete mystery. Due to the nature of human language, specifically the descriptive mechanism of language, time can only be regarded as the duration of whatever scenario we are concerned with at the moment of concern: TIME IS A DURATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS. Einstein's suggestion that time is the fourth dimension implies that past and future are separated from the here-now by the insertion of a hyphen between space and time. In reality,. these are only words and words always refer to something e lse. No amount of semantic trickery can change the fact that the cosmos is not constructed of alphanumeric imagery. Only our apprehension and consideration is thus fabricated. It's the old saw: THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY. The essence we are dealing with is tripolar with three degrees of ambiretroc ity -- i.e. the cosmos is 100% omnidirectionally retrogradient, following the third law of thermodynamics. Even though the enigma of temporality has its only solution at the instant of our personal death we may speculate upon its nature by dismantling a clock and observe the cause of its ticking. Note that a coil spring loads the escapement mechanism with a reserve of ki netic energy stored up in the elastricity of the spring. If the spring happens to break due to molecular flaw, the universe goes on down the road without it. Time does not depend on how it is measured, but is measured by how it depends....beginningness is absurd in regards to matter. \" Most people believe that time passes. In reality, it stays where it is. The c oncept of passing time is false, because man, limited to experiencing time only as passing, does not understand that it stays where it is .\" Dogen, Zen Master. \" To put it differently, we do not live in time, but time lives within us...S pace is externalized, objectivated time, time projected outward. Time...is internalize d, subjectivated space...Time and space are related to each other as the inside to the outside of the same thing .\" Lama Govinda. The universe depends totally upon time which stops when we die. Therefore time is life. The universe is a cycloscillating complex of events that was never born and can never die."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" CIRCULAR UNITY AND THE TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE (T.R.I.) In thermodynamics, an ideal process is called a reversible process, defined as a change in the state of a system which goes through a continuous succession of equilibrium states. The full definition/description of circular unity begins first with the definition of the word unity. As defined by R. Buckminster Fuller in SYNERGETICS II: \"Unity is plural and at minimum sixfold.\" Circular unity, then, can be graphically demonstrate by a circle divided into six individual but interdependent sections. The color wheel is a good graphic example of circular unity, and represents six discrete qualities of six individual but interdependent quantities represented by each section of the wheel. A circle divided into six distinct quantities, each with individual but interdependent qualities...i.e. unification of number and geometry. In that SIX is the sum and/or product of the first three numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 or 1 x 2 x 3, it contains a harmonious whole number relationship with them, and is thus called the first \"perfect number\". The first instance of the harmonic synchronization of number and geometry (quantity and quality ) occurs in the number six. However, this prescription for circular unity is two-dimensional. Three pairs a re each separated by the centerpoint which has no dimension. In order to formulate a spatial abstraction of circular unity, we draw three lines that interconnect t he six face centers of a cube and enclose that cube within a sphere. Doubling this two dimensional circular unity produces the first true Holotome (A) which is predicated on number twelve. This three dimensional holotome of six positive, and six negative, symmetrical retrograde event identity axes, i s then also represented by the closepacking of twelve spheres about a thirteenth nucleus sphere. This produces the dodecahedron, (the primitive non-pi spherical module). This TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE then, contains the graphic capability to represent a virtual spacetime object. One example found in nature i s the primary cleavage planes of crystals. We invoke the entirety of Dr. Fuller's master work, SYNERGETICS II to cla rify the preceding remarks. The following shows the fundamental platform from which the Holotomes evolve: Perfect number (Unity) = 6 Nave of Holotome A Doublation produces =12 (Zodiac) or Holotome A times two =24 Holotome B"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"times three =72 Holotome C times five =360 Holotome D times seven =2520 Holotome E In this way,. circular unity is conserved by the employment of prime numbers only. No redundant multiplexing is done through numbers that contain factors of division as in the case of the factorials. It is easy to tell, at least with very high propbability, whether or not a large integer is a prime. If it is not a prime, then it can be written as a product of two or more factors. For instance the integer 146,527,939,199 is the product of the two primes 1,445,599 and 101,361,401. There are no methods currently known for efficiently determining factors of large nonprime integer. An important scheme for secret codes, developed in the last decade, relies for its security on the difficulty of factorization. As a result, the U.S. National Secur ity Agency is interested in factoring. The coding scheme has also caused a strong surge of interest among mathematicians in the problem of designing well-define d proceedures, or algorithms, to factor integers. The Holotomes are the minimal numerical magnitudes to accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. WHEN MAPPED OUT IN A CIRCULAR ARRAY, EACH OF THESE MATHEMATICAL ENTITIES PRODUCE A HALF-POSITIVE, HALF- NEGATIVE, SYMMETRICAL RETROGRADE MANDALOG, which represents the GRAPHIC SYNTAX of a Holotome. Here are the graphics of the Holotomic Sequence: The baseten concept of quantitative notation consists of a sign denoting nothing, 0 (zero), a sign denoting singularity, I (one), and eight other signs denoting eight discrete degrees or ratios of plurality: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, altogether representing a cyclic continuity of plural members we call numbers. This continuum must be regarded as an endless series inasmuch as there can be no such idea-entity as a highest or top number. Because of this open-ended nature of numbering this continuum is said to be infinite, that is, without an end. Because of this infinite quality of the numeric continuum, we cannot speak of number as having a definite structure, however, if we choose to regard any particular numerical event beyond duality, then we have a finite series which is then a closed system. Such a system then contains a definite structure which may be described in words, geometrical structures, graphs, diagrams, etc. To arbitrarily choose a number (amount) for the purpose of establishing a finite and therefore describable system of numbers will provide only one of very many possible systems and/or structures; (the term \"infinite number\" is meaningl ess)."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The foregoing proposition contains the reason for the need of a non-arbitrary numerical modual that renders possible a scientifically systematic method of describing members in terms of structure and behavior. Such non-arbitrary numerical modules now exist. They are called Holotomes: a discrete plural quantum of coherently describable interaction, i.e. a finite uni ty of a plural componentry. For those readers who may think that a Holotome is something new, or recently invented, there is indisputable evidence from existing records that clearly indic ate that the Sumerians understood the discrete series of Holotomes over 6000 years ago. That their knowledge of the Holotomes was still clearly remembered as la te as 1900 years ago is evident in the writings of the New Testament. The information contained in the ensuing pages is instrument not only to the intrinsic nature of number, but also to the specific way in which number relates to the descriptive mechanisms of human languages, that is, to the exact and actual structure of an ideal, non-paradoxical syntax. The crux of the descriptive mechanism of language revolves around the Greek prefix QU as in WHO and HOW much (identity and plurality) and of course, Quality and Quantity. This preceded the English prefix WH (as in WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHICH, and WHY). This yields the full sixfold coordinate system of the descriptive mechanism: 1 WHO : Identity: person A 2 WHAT : Identity : object E 3 WHEN : Time : duration I 4 WHERE : Space : extension O 5 WHICH : Plurality : number U 6 WHY : Causality: and/or HOW Y These relate to eternal questions of our orientation in the cosmos: Who am I? What is the object and source of being, and limitations? When will I die? Where do I come from? Which is my path in life? For what purpose? How am I related to it? In the table, the six vowels are all accounted for and figure qualitatively in the si x primary axes of description. The fact that unity is plural and at minimum sixfold gives added credibility to the concept of the TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE, which is the fundamental paradigm upon which rests the symmetrical unity of the Holotomes. Marshall asserts that the Sumerian alphabet contained exactly six vowels, t hree primary and three secondary, which suggests an interesting correspondence between ancient descriptive syntax and the T.R.I. in the color wheel."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"These comments suppliment the intended meaning of the phrase, \"IDEAL SYNTAX,\" which should clarify the idea that paradox results from unconscious disregard of retrocity in at least one of the three primary axes of qualific ation. IDEAL SYNTAX becomes possible through the concept of word contexts that derive from a rational correlation between quantitative notation and geometrical notation. This may be understood as a GRAPHIC SYNTAX. The sequence of mandalogs that represent the Holotomes is an example of this graphic syntax: a rational arrangement of numbers, words, and geometry, by which to convey information not available to the imperfect literary syntax of modern scientific philosophy or what is otherwise termed physiomathematic al epistemography. When Sir Isaac Newton formulated the third law of motion, he could have been much more general and stated that for every axiom there is an equal and opposite reaxiom. The third law of motion is as much a statement about descriptive language as it is about any intrinsic behavior of physical law. The concept of action and reaction occurring on a straight line is not stated but is unconsciously accepted. We know that in modern dynamics, curves and vectors are fundamental, since spacetime is curvilinear. A vector is a line of force aimed in a known angular direction in respect to an axis of reference. The length of the vector is the product of its mass multiplied by its velocity. Number is not at all what we think but how we think. Remember, the alphanumerical aspect of language in ancient times. Language, both oral and written is the result of the ideas evolving from pluralit y on the neurological level. Civilized culture could not exist without the subliminal notions occuring beneath the words, each, every, any, many, both, all, and either/or, etc. Up/down, right/left, and front and aft are cognitions that precede conceptions and symbols in the matrix of the mind. Number and geometry are quantity and quality on the prelinguistic level. The T.R.I. depicts six forward and six reverse quantity quality event scenari o data events on the non-semantic level. It is another way of demonstrating that within the context of oral tradition the roots of written language reach in six directions. An example is the Qabalistic meditation device known as THE CUBE OF SPACE, also known as the Key of the Cosmos. In it, each direction and vector is assigned an alphnumerical glyph from the Hebrew alphabet (See Part Four). The T.R.I. provides conceptual orientation in imaginal space in much the same way. The six directions stem from three ambiconceptual axes of spatial cognition. Time, which we do not directly perceive, is totally conceptual. Number/geometry is the preverbal mind-scape from which we derive our pictur e of the so-called real world. The mind's eye sees very differently than in our"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"familiar three-dimensional world. Geometry lets the inner eye visualize suc h spaces as if they truly existed. Mathematics teaches us this art and at the same time protects us from illusi ons. For to understand these spaces, we must first rely upon the exact symbolism of formulas. Only then can we stand aside and give free reign to our imagination. The most fundamental geometrical concept is the idea of dimension. Number/geometry is the foundation of the conceptual world, not real at all. We perceive plurality without resort to number, just as we perceive qualities wi thout the words that refer to them. Numbers, letters, and symbols are devices of utility in themselves and are only required to suppliment the utility of our legs, arms, hands, fingers, and cerebral activity. Social order can exist without language but language only exists b ecause there is an innate order in our interpersonal concerns. The archives of antiquity speak of many disciplines predicated on the metrologies peculiar to all successful technological cultures. The number twelve (12) and its multiples stand as an exemplary statement of number utility. They range from the signs of the Zodiac, the labors of Hercules, the hours in the day, the months of the year, the planets of the Sumerian solar system, the stones of Aaron's breastpl ate, birth stones, the tribes of Israel, the twelve spheres around the 13th nuclear sphere of Fuller's Vector Equilibrium Matrix. By SYNDEX definition, one is a singularity, not unity, and therefore not a number in the sense that the other eight base numbers are unifications of a plurality of singularities. This misunderstanding was acknowledged in the Qaba la by stating that Aleph is the first letter, but it does not count. This story is in ac cord with the legend of Lord Krishna who lost one of his ten fingers on the last day of creation, but still considers one as a number or digit. The ten number signs only contain eight true numbers: 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 and 9, as an octave. No transpalindromic sequence can exceed four forward and four reverse number event identities. Multiples of nine: 18 27 36 45 nave 54 63 72 81 Thus, the retrograde cycle of number is an octave cycle, with a ninth null event, as stated by Bucky Fuller, the first modern number analyst to recognize this c rucual aspect of number behavior."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"BASE TEN NUMBER DYNAMICS \"Henri Poincare, for instance, says: \"Every whole [natural] number is detached from the others, it possesses its own individuality, so to speak; each one of them forms a kind of exception, for which reason also general theorems of number theory are but seldom forthcoming.\" Nevertheless, this individual aspect of number appears to contain the mysterious factor that enables it to organize psyche and matter jointly.\" M.-L. von Franz, Number and Time \"The number one as the first and original number is strictly speaking not a number at all. One as unity and totality exists prior to the awareness of numbers which requires a capacity to distinguish between separate discrete entities. Thus, one symbolically corresponds to the uroboros state prior to creation and the separation of things. Two is the first real number.\" Edward Edinger, Ego and Archetype We consider numbers to be so familiar that we have nothing left to discover about them of any possible interest. But perhaps this is not so. The continuum of base ten number is generally looked upon as a progressive and linear series of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Iterations signify the simple addition of the initial unit to each resulting member encountered in the continuing series of elements known as numbes. The digits 1 - 9 are known as integers or numerals. Of course, multiples of 10, 100, 1000, etc. are formed simply by adding zeros. Further analysis discloses that this continuum can be viewed as both progressive and regressive . It is not exclusively linear, but has a cyclic function resulting from the terminal character of the last base digit and the next beginning initia ted by zero producing the two-digit range. This doubling of number is for all practical purposes a cyclic function that recycles again and again with each ten-fold group produced. Besides the cyclic and ambidirectional aspects of the number series, there is also a periodic series of reversals that occur in conjunction with the cyclic aspect. This ongoing combination of diverse functions can be considered a mixing effect not unlike an egg beater that folds the medium over and over. Remember, from our previous discussion that \"OM is said to issue from a process of multifold reflection.\" That process, exactly, is revealed in the number continuum when we can hold a metaphorical mirror up to nature's primal manifestation--the natura l number sequence."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The key to the comprehensive analysis of general number behavior is found in the concept of \"circular unity.\" Circular unity is an idea demonstrated by the harmonious interaction of the first six numbers. SIX is the first perfect number i s the sum of its first three digits, or 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 1 x 2 x 3 = 6; 6 2 = 36; 36 x 3 = 108; 36 2 =1296 x 2 = 2592. The term \"unity\" (or Universe for that matter) implies something that i s composed of parts. Fuller agreed, and stated it as, Unity is plural and at minimum two, or at minimum six. The sequence of perfect numbers (6, 28, 496, etc.) does not have the structural nor metrological significance of the Holotomic Sequence, which graphically displa ys an important structural order within prime number distribution. Note that the first Pythagorean Triple 3:4:5 equals 12, which is Holotome A (which is also twice the first perfect number). 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. The sheer complexity of the waves and cycles that are generated wit hin the base ten continuum cannot be described nor explained with conventional modes of philosophical description. Number theorists must resort to higher mathematics. But these cycles can be demonstrated graphically so they are visible even t o those not mathematically inclined. Synchrographics has been systematically contrived to formally illustrat e behavioral patterns that have successfully led to a general understanding of the fundamental elements of the reflective and symmetrical as well as geome trical nature of the base ten system. Can we find a cosmic mandate expressing Fuller's assertion that unity is pl ural and at minimum sixfold? The Holotomes and Holotomic Sequence fulfill this mandate with neat, logical finite sections. They represent circular unity and whatever else remains of the \"infinite rest\" that swells beyond our immedi ate focus. When we refer to the base of a number system, such as base ten, we are also referring to the amount of iterations in a loop or cycle for the FOLDMENT that multiplies the base and the multiples of that base is for all purposes a circle. The coexistent independency and interdependency of the base digits creates the rational notion that continuity is discontinuous. From this we derive the closed loop logic of the Holotomes as discrete levels of finitude. The graphic importance of this particular Holotomic Sequence is that circular symmetry is being conserved and may be enlisted as the fundamental reference key in the graphic investigation of number behavvior. The primes are deployed in symmetrical interface only within these specific Holotomic domains. The Synchrographic process of regarding symmetry as a primary analyti cal aspect of reference makes the Syndex archetypal system of fundamental clas ses of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"numbers possible. The foundation of this system is the palindromes and transpalindromes. These 12 archetypal classes of number are catalogued by the ambidirectiona l glyphs that discloses the transbinomial nature of any individual number. Only 12 permutations exist in the total foldment of the number field or domain: retrosquare primes, retroprime composites, transpalindromes squares, retr osquare composite, palindromic composite, retrocomposite prime, transpalindromic prime, retroprime square, palindromnic square, retrocomposite square, transpalindromic composite, palindromic prime. The so-called four fundamental operations of arithmatic are in reality two binomial pairs: addition is reverse subtraction; multiplication is reverse divi sion. The term transpalindrome is invoked merely to establish a context through which to establish a bilateral system of numerical classification, that is, to cr eate a notational link between any integer of 2-digits or more with its antithetical or reverse companion. For example, number 21 is the transpalindromic companion of number 12. This simple concept brings into being a host of valid structural relationships that would otherwise be totally ignored. For example, number 16 is the ONLY 2-digit square that is a prime when reversed: 16 is a square, 61 is a prime. We call number 16 a retroprime square, and number 61 is conversely termed a retrosquare prime. Without his classification system, it is impossible to analyze the number fie ld. Palindromes, or binomial reflection numbers are neither purely accidental nor without significance. Remember, OM (#108) issued fom a process of multifold reflection to create the entire universe of phenomena. It is through the classification process that the enigma of prime numbe r distribution has been solved. By labelling all possible permutation s of the ambidirectional system of number dynamics, we find there are twelve discrete members in the domain of number class. In order to systematize the study of the base ten concept, a graphic format w as essential to organize sizable spans of the continuum for in-depth analysis. The enspiralment of number offered itself as the ideal format. The cyclations of t he spiral could be referenced to the longer cyclic periods intrinsic to number itsel f. There are cycles within cycles, more readily seen in graphic format than i n a continuous sequence. This was the general reasoning for adopting the synchrographic methods: to condense, or sample the number continuum, and establish reference to related periods of cyclicity.

And the Hindus used exactly the same figures as metrological modules, as have all subsequent civilizations. Temple architecture is based on multiples of 36 = 6 2 ."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"In Cosmic Fishing , Applewhite recounts Fuller's reaction to the great hexagonal court in the ancient ruins of Baalbek. He said, \"The Phoenicians knew my principles.\" So, Numeronomy, the laws relating to the essential structure and dynamics of number, is a new word for an extremely ancient science. This science, based on the knowledge that the continuum contains a definite structural order with general laws that describe the nature of that order, has laws that relate to the gene ral behavior and structure of nature itself. In Synchrographics, the cyclic and reflexive nature of the cardinal/ordinal num ber series is portrayed through a graphic context which reveals the minimal set of key numbers required to show the coherent nature of prime number order. Synchrographics suggests some new terms, including a 12 symbol alphabet which is justified by the context. Systematic investigation of the intrinsic str ucture of the numeric series is purely a matter of selecting a graphic method of mapping numbers in their natural order so that geometrical order is also an integral a spect of that sequence. The system of multiradial and multiaxial interfacing between number an d idea is called spatial formation. The maps that include the relationshi ps of circular unity and the distribution of primes and other classes of num ber are called mandalogs. The employment of this multirelational spread sheet permits the number analy st to consider aspects of the numeric continuum that would otherwise not be taken into account and therefore beyond the order-seeking functions of human mentality. The first important concept of numeronomy is the exemplary base wave. The wave begins both before and after number 10. In fact, it is called the nineleven cycloflex bacause it is the result of the mutual interaction of both nine and eleven. This wave begins at ten and concludes its first cycle at 99 (9x11 = 99). Then it continues through the multiples of 99 and never ends. This is called exemplary because it sets up a continuous pattern that never ceases and never changes. This pattern is responsible for the continuous integrity of number behavior.

Numeronomy is the outcome of Synchrographics. Numbers speak for themselves"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"through structure and behavior. And it is the task of Fuller's synergetic geomet ry to identify energy with number. The single most important discovery of the SYNDEX PROJECT is the Holotome and the Holotomic Sequence, created by prime number multiplexing. It was discovered on Synchrograph C. The second most important discovery is the Exemplary Basewave Octave or Nineleven Cycloflex. It was also discovered by meditating on the C Graph. The third important discovery is the four pairs of 2-digit transpalindrom ic primes which served as major clues to the discovery of the coherent ord er of prime number distribution. The fourth discovery is how the Holotomes relate to the exemplary octave wavecycle. Number/geometry is the fundamental cornerstone of human communication and specifically the alphanumeric principle of descriptive notation. The T.R.I. represents the geonumerical basis of the sequence of minimal pluralities t hat accomodate the maximum amount of divising factors. The Holotomic mandalogs display the retrograde symmetry of each of the circular unities in the form of a half positive and half negative octave system predicated on the octave nature of the so-called base ten system of number. The base ten system of number is an octave system, where either one or nine can be seen as a null value event. Furthermore, this octave can be regarded as a cyclic function. The zero, one, or nine can function as the null event which acts as the null value gap between the beginning and ending of the octave retrograde cyclation, due to its half positive and half negative symmetrical sycle (which negates the numerical value of one or nine hust as if they were of the same nature as zero). Due to the octave nature of the eight true numbers, no transpalindromic sequence can exceed an octave cycle. Each Holotome in the sequence of holotomes when represented in a radial series of the numbers is composed of a perfectly symmetrical array of prime numbers diametrically opposed to other prime numbers or numbers composed of primes multiplying other primes. Also, the intervals that separate the primes are diametrically opposed to the same magnitude intervals across the wheel, yie lding 100% perfect radial symmetry. In the context of the Holotomes, then, the deployment of prime numbers is an orderly progression. This ends the tradition that the primes do not occur e according to any recognizable pattern."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"This is the essence of the holotomes and their graphic elegance. Graphic al elegance is often found in simplicity of design and complexity of data. Visually attractive graphics also gather their power from content and interpretations beyond the immediate display of some numbers. The best graphics are about the useful and important, about life and death, about the universe. Beautiful graphics do not traffic with the trivial. On rare occasions, graphical architecture combines with the data content to yiel d a uniquely spectacular graphic. Such performances can be described and admired, but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonderful graphic in a million. Number is considered so simple and mundane in nature that a popular assumption exists that there is nothing more to know about it that could really be of any valid significance. In a sense, number is self evident and apparently contains no subtle mysteries. Contrary to this attitude, number is the repository of a highly complex system of very intricate and involved interrelationships that have shape d the cosmological and religious backgrounds of all cultures. They affect us unconsciously at the deepest levels of our belief system, which in turn conditions our thoughts, feeling, and behavior. The true mechanisms operating in the number chain can be shown in a system of incremental spirals portraying the numeric continuum and the special events which occur in it. R.B. Fuller recognized this when he w rote to Marshall, March 3, 1981: \"Your cyclic synchrographing work clarifies and simplifies this whole matter to an epochal degree.\" SYNCHROGRAPHICS Synchrographics is an innovative, systematic discipline interfacing the natur al base ten integer progression with the fundamental elements of geometry. Thi s institutes a graphic synthesis of the the two basic disciplines which in essenc e are initially two interdependent concepts that only occur through their mutuality. The Pythagorean Triples that begin with the 3-4-5 triangle bring to note this initial unity of number and geometry attesting to the scientific validity of the synchrographic method of analysing relationships. They are not at all evident without such an interdisciplinary medium. Each holotome expressed in synchrographic form is geometrically symmetrical.

In that the initial holotome is twelve and all subsequent holotomes are a multiple of that number, the valuable duodecimal interface that encompasses the base digits is reflected in the substratum of all holotomes. Synchrographics offers a plausible answer to the question of why the Babylonians adopted the 360 degree circular unity. The ancient Hindus chose 108, which is 3 x 36.) The classic answer is that 360 has many divisors. But perhaps some unknown numerist discovered this sequence in the ancient past. This sequence is generated by doubling the first perfect number six to equal 12. Then doubling 12 for 24. Then multiplying 24 by the first true prime 12 x 3 = 72. Then by multiplying that number by the next true prime 72 x 5 = 360. Then multiplying that by the next true prime: 360 x 7 = 2520, etc. By beginning with twelve we have already involved 2,3,4, and 6. By doubling 12 we have involved #8. or five of the base digits. By multiplying 24 by prime number three, we involve nine, or six base digits. By multiplying 72 by 5, we involve seven base digits or 2,3,4,5,6,8 and 9. Finally, by multiplying 360 by 7 we have captured them all: 2520. If the Babylonian metrologists knew of this, neither they nor modern number theorists make mention of it. Whatever the case, the Holotomes are ideally adapted as instruments for tranla ting intricate geometrical interrelationships into the language of number. Only throug h the careful study of these special modules does the exquisite order of prime number occurrance become obvious, for the primes are found to be deployed in symmetrical interface only within these specific holotomic domains. Thus, number stripped of its structural character is reduced to the empty and monotonous iterations used essentially for counting objects and measuring distances. When numbers, on the other hand, are permitted to be deployed in cycles that are in phase with their already inherent rhythms, a clearer picture emerges. All mandalogs are the product of the systematic generation of the exact sequence of minimax factorization. They have the perfect retrograde feat ure by which the patterns generated in the first half of the spiral are rever sed at midpoint and are reflected as a mirrored image in the second half of the spiral. Remember, OM was formed by multifold reflection! Also, because of the existence of palindromes and other reflective qualities issuing through each holotome there is an exemplary wave form that begins at the end of the first holotome. This is a dual component wave, resembling the DNA"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"helix. The wave begins amid number ten and is composed of square number nine and palindromic prime number eleven. This compound cyclic wave is labeled the nineleven cycloflex. It cycles and oscillates through multiples of ninetynine and produces decant or tenf old series of consistent tranpalindromic sequences or numbers. Each nu mber in the sequence has its perfect reversal on the corresponding other sid e. The total reversal of number should always have been expected in that the number chain is by its graphic nature a two-way street, refolded again in the four fundamental operations of arithmatic. The graphic mandalogs contain a rational and logical system of interrelating number and geometry or quality and quantity. They are graphic expressions of identical ideas regarding the descriptions of events in nature. A critical consideration in expressing the optimum number of interrelated rati os is to do so with a minimum amount of graphic details. That is, to show the most information with the least given axis of reference. The mandalogs, or number wheels, are mathematical entities which express a plurality of interde pendent formulae in a simple singular system. The cornerstone of SYNCHROGRAPHICS is the preliminary Pythagorean Triple: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12: Holotome A times two equals B or 24 times prime number three equals C or 72 times prime number five equals D or 360 times prime number seven equals E or 2520 times prime number eleven equals F or 27720 times prime number thirteen equals G or 360360 In this way, the minimal numbers that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division are generated by the multiplication of each resultant sum with the next prime number in its natural order of occurrence. Each of these Holotomes is a number of special geometry, a circular unity. Expressed as a geometrical entity, a synchrographed Holotome is found to be reflectively symmetrical. At its midpoint, its initial pattern reve rses and its second half becomes a reflection of its first half, much as OM created the Univers e through its \"multifold reflection.\" J.S. Bach used this numerical phenomena in his Crab Canon or Retrograde Fugue. The breakdown of that notation was 22 x 144 or 3168. This number is cited in the Qabala as the perimeter of Solomon's temple: 3168 divided by 1008 = 3.1428571 (4 x 252). The secret traditions seem to have made liberal use of the Holotomes without ever pointing them out."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The number 3168 has special qualities: By adding the palindrome which is the sum of a palindrome times another palindrome: 3168 5445 : 55 x 99 8613 We get a reversal of the initial number. The ninety-nine cycle is the carrier wave of the transpalindromic reflecti on sequence. This sequence is crucial to the mapping of the natural number scenario because the 99 cycle issues through the Holotomes. The Holotomes are ideally adapted as an instrument for translating into the language of number the intricate geometrical interrelations between the configurations of cubic space. The Pythagorean Triples are the best example s of the interdependent nature of number and geometry. These triples logically deduced as an \"infinite set\" all share the 90 degree angle. They show the geonumeric character which describes the same ratios and interrelations hips in different styles of notation. Synchrographics begins with the assumption that since number and geometry are two ways of expressing the same set of ratios or relationships, then it holds true that a graphic device may be generated that faithfully aligns these two methods of notation in a synchronetic diagram. That is, a single notational system may express the geometrical nature of number and visa versa. The \"four progressively additive and four progressively subtractive ev ent octaes with a ninth null event\" depicts the primary cycle or finite e xtent of the initial program parameter. With the turnaround occuring at ten (between square number nine and prime number eleven), the nineleven wavecycle then begins and proc eeds to fortynine and a half (49.5). It turns around and proceeds to ninetynine (99), and thereafter continues through the multiples of 99 to 1089 or the only four- digit transpalindromic square. The behavior or structure of the baseten system requires the perspective of an integrated complex where number and geometry are interqualifying aspects of an unified system of congruent identities. The character of notation determines whether data is in the form of number or geometry. Each requires the other in order to be expressed. This interdependency authorizes the synchrograph to represent a number as a geometrical phenomena in which each holotome contains the triquadric core intitiated in number 12."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Holotome A diagram Thus, every subsequent holotome retains a copy of the initial data, plus new more involved data. Each and every holotome is a symmetrical retrograde MANDALOG , representing the four progressively additive then progressively subtractive event octaves with a ninth null event synchronicity. Altogether it represents the octave nine system of R.B. Fuller, or Marshall's nineleven cycloflex. The exemplary compound wavecycle which proliferates through the multiples of 99 is the carrier wave that both integrates and isolates the Holotomes with accumulative integrity. In this scenario, the primes behave in an orderly manner through their special palindromic members: 13 31 17 71 37 73 79 97 The four pairs of two-digit palindromic primes form the octave bridge i n the 99 cycle. The general laws of number behavior can now be written from the behaviors clarified through synchrographic mapping techniques. Numeronomy is th en expressed or emanated through the tranpalindromic functions, which remain unseen in classical number theory and structure. The intellectual separation of geometry from number removed from number the purely geometrical aspects of the numerical continuum that made the holotomes apparent as symmetrical mathematical entities. Only through the study of these special modules does the exquisite orde r of prime number occurrence become obvious. These geometric number wheels are unique examples of circular unities. The primes are deployed in symmetrical interface only within these s pecific Holotomic domains. There is a way in which to seek out these entities by intermultiplying the pri mes from a special base module. Much in the way that the factorials are produced but with the difference that diminishes the huge sums that result from the redundant multiplication of the accumilating composites, out of what would have been primes. We begin with six, the first perfect number, then double it to produce 12, which we call a holotome. This produces a number wheel that involves all of the base digits plus three of the first two-digit numbers. This number wheel contains all of the needed geometry by which to proliferate the family of related Holotomes."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"All mandalogs are the product of the systematic generation of the exact seque nce of minimax factorization.

They are graphically elegant due to simplicity of design and complexity of data. Visually attractive, they gather their power from content and interpretati ons beyond the immediate display of some numbers. The best graphics (most important and beautiful) are about the useful and important, about life and death, about the universe. They contain maximal information with minimal graphic elements. On rare occasions graphical architecture combines with the data c ontent to yield a uniquely spectacular graphic. Such performances can be described a nd admired but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonderful graphic in a million. The first solid indication of a rational link between prime numbers and square numbers was found in the diagram entitled the prime/square interface which actually includes the composites in that the full ove rview addresses the holistic interaction of all classes. The prime/square interface diagram consists of a vertical column of the fir st one hundred and one numbers with their squares listed on a right hand column. The finite extent of this number map is calculated to encompasse the full range of the 99 cycle. The cycle contains the exemplary basewave that is essential to the structural integity of the Holotomes. This wave in a certain sense is such tha t it determines the point places in the continuum where discontinuity may or may not occur. The mandalog, then, is a graphic mathematical entity for the expression of a plurality of interdependent formula in a simplicated singular system , i.e. an information containment mechanism, or book: Holotome. Such a device contains information and is at the same time a device to convey information clearly and accurately, with a minimal possibility of ambiguit y, error, or paradox. In classical systems of encoding and conveying information, elements of paradox occur through the vehicle of language itself. The fault generally exists in the very foundation of language at the fundamental level of syntax. It is through the transpalindromic nature of the natural baseten number sequence that the irregular occurrence of prime numbers is recogni zed as a purely causally-determined pattern of rational explanation. The classical approach to a study of prime numbers is such that the primes are considered more or less estranged from other classes of numbers in hopes that the primes might manifest some intrinsic rhythm of their own that could be found to account for distribution, density, etc."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"No single class can be isolated as an element responsible as a determinant of any specified classes of behavior, since the full compliment of classes that compri ze the self-modifying continuum interact congressionally. Synchrographic analysis has shown that an exemplary wave form is formulated i n the structuring of the base digits which when issuing through the sequence of numbers maintains its own structural quality even while it modifies the quality of the numerical event identities it encounters. This wave form occurs through the mutual interaction of square number nine and palindromic prime number eleven. In that nine times eleven equals ninetynine, the wave proliferates through the multiples of ninetynine. Fuller did not have the advantage of synchrographs to clearly see and properly describe this basewave. This description of an octave-nine system had the turnaround at fifty. The true nineleven turnaround is a 49.5. The graphic mandalogs allow us to monitor the exemplary basewave that is guided through the continuum of natural number by the cyclic and reflexive qualities inherent in the special or noble numbers. In the Prime/Square Interface Diagram, the basewave is seen to contain its elf throught the palindromic mechanism that is sustained through the four pairs of transpalindromic primes that act as transnumeric relay stations. The tapestry of number is literally woven with the four warps and four woofs, or octave, of the transpalindromic bridge between the fist and only two-digit pralindromic prime number 11 and the first, but not only, 3-digit prime number 101--primes that are known to proliferate palindromes in being multiplied by themselves. The full importance of the basewave continuity observed in the multiples of 99 is only realized when investigating its involvement in the structure of the Holotomes. The initial holotomes contain only a rational section of a complete cycle; that portion necessary to insure a quality of infinity, (the number rep eating itself indefinitely). The number structure or number behavior mapping technique makes number theory visibly coherent. Synchrographic techniques are scientifically sys tematic. The general scheme of Numeronomy involves a more complete system of classification which takes special note of both the palindromic and transpalindromic nature of number. It is possible (but remains to be calculated), that the holotomes contain a consistent ratio between primes and non-primes with the holotomes that precede and follow.

For example, 16 and 61."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Another example involving a transpalindromic distinction is when a reversed number remains in its class, like 13 and 31 which are both primes, i.e. transpalindromic primes as compared to a simple palindromic prime such as eleven. These are only twelve permutations possible within the whole continuum of number. The complete analysis of number behavior is not possible without taking into account the palindromic and transpalindromic characters of number. This is the crucial and paramount reason that the behvaior of prime numbers have remained an enigma for so long. Number theory has ignored the ambidirectional reflexivity inherent in the number continuum. Regaining an impartial view of how reflexivity is totally conserved w ithin the continuum leaves no gaps in the concept of numerical continuity. The synchrographs and mandalogs used in this study are to support the contin uity that has been disrupted by the belief that prime numbers are withou t connective order. Toward this end, we introduce approximately 16 new words that fill in the missing blanks to form a coherent picture or concept of true number dynam ics. The term \"synchrostat\" designates an event synchronicity in the numeric continuum. This term and its subsequent Tables were valuable tools in indentifying a cyclic se ries of numbers that embody features that were common to all members of the series. They embody and exemplify a practice that was used to explore many other cycle s until the main base cycle was finally discovered. Synchrostat illus. here. Comprehending the universal nature of the transpalindromic functi on of number behavior is not easy. We tend to see the number chain as a unidirectional continuum, which is too linear for a synergetic perspective. Revisionin g it with the concept of simultaneous counterflow yields a more accurate picture. With large spans of number, the complex interrelationships become difficul t to visualize. Fortunately, because of the octave nature of the base cycle there cannot be mor e than four consecutive transpalindromic pairs in a single symmetrical se quence, regardless of the amount of digits in each individual number. However, we are only looking at the multiples of nine. But, in fact, all the numbers in between are also involved in transpalindromic transactions. To address such a comple x interchange by graphic means can only be accomplished in a series of static c ross- sections each involving no more than the eight required transactions. The exemplary 99 wavecycle affords us a context that gives a graphic expres sion of total transpalindromic symmetry which it is possible to contemplate with clarity . All the Holotomes contain the same general mechanism seen in the 99 cycle, but even t he Holotomes must be contemplated in various graphic modes to capture their full integr ity."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Transpalindromicity functions through the ambidirectional nature of number. It is therefore, the initial or primary function of number behavior in general. All detai ls of number behavior derive primarily from a transpalindromic function operating throug h an ambidirectional chain of ambidirectional numerical events. If any aspect of direction is left unconsidered in the behavior of any specifie d event then behavior observed in connection with that event will have been compromised. In the past, there has been a general disregard for the retrocity of number in general. Yet, no single function is more important or interesting than this transpalindromic nature in deter mining the basic waveforms inherent in baseten numeration. Transpalindromic symmetry refers to a circular module of numerical rela tionships and interoperations which form a totally harmonious retrograde and symmetrical oct ave unity. The emphasis is not on palindromes, but on the relationship existing between palindromes and transpalindromes: 1089 Palindromes: 55 x 99 = 5445 9018 We can take any number, reverse it, add the two numbers together, continue to reverse and add, and eventually end up with a palindrome--a number whose digits appear in the same order whether they are read from left to right or from right to left. Transpalindromic symmetry is not isolated to the few graphic expressions subm itted here as examples to clarify the meaning of this neologism (transpalindromicity) on the subject of number behavior. Transpalindromic behavior itself is a totally general condition of the number cha in and is operative throughout the continuum. It is also a primary factor in the graphic disc losure of many subtle but important aspects of number behavior; an intrinsic structural conditi on effecting every and all numbers in their collective interactions. Transpalindromic symmetry is a condition relating to specific isolated g roups of number or special numerical quata where symmetry manifests as a collective mutua l interaction.

The case has not yet been reported where this does not hold true. Even though this postulate is unprovable in the sense that all even numbers can't be checked out, it may be provable through a true understanding of how the sequence of number operates. No even number may be a prime because of the prior occurrence of number 2, which acts as a divisor for all even numbers. The first three odd numbers are primes because no number preceding them has occurred that could act as a divisor. Number 9 is the first odd number that is not a prime, because of the prior occurrence of number 3. Therefore, the occurrence of the first odd number as a composite is the result of the previous occurrence of an odd number that had no preceding divisors except unity, which is indivisible by definition. So, the composite nature of 9 is causally determined in tha t 9 would have been a prime like all previous odd numbers, but for the prior occurrence of number 3. From this it may be postulated that all even numbers will be composites, and all odd numbers are potentially primes unless some previous odd number has occurred that acts as a factor, rendering them composites. This is also a way of saying that every odd number that is not a prime is the product of at least one previous prime and one previous composite, (3 + 6 = 9). But the serial equatability of the of the progressively divisible number cha in produces a surplus of combinations to produce primes from even numbers. In fact, as numbers progress, composites will occur that accomodate multiple sets of primes and visa ve rsa, rendering the Goldbach Postulate a probability. The assumption that all odd numbers would be primes if no previous number had occured that would act as a divisible factor perfectly fits the case. If the prior num ber had not occured, or could be stricken out, as in the case of number three, 9 would be a prime number, but sincle three is three and not something else, 9 is a composite. The fact that nine is also a square number tells us also that the generation of squares , cubes, etc. is also a result of the occurrence of previous odd numbers, as two odds make and even and two of the same odd numbers multiply into a square number. Continuity is a provisional term that requires a context describing a series of entity events that connect or disconnect to or from each other."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The primes have always been regarded as a single class with no breakdown into s ub- classes, no different kinds of primes. Secondly, the primes have been viewed apart from the composites, thereby ignorin g any relationships that they certainly must share with other classes of number. The first indications that other classes of primes exist was found in the nature of square numbers. The square number sixteen contains unique features when reversed to 61, as we have noted elsewhere. All consecutive primes between 0 and 1000 differ from each other by even numbers which range from 2 to 20 with one exception: none differ from each other by 16, reflecting our exceptional 2-digit prime/square reversal. The first three digits--1,2, and 3--are generally regarded as primes, but the initial members are in a class by themselves. One is not even a number, in the serial sens e. It does not multiply like real numbers do. Two is also not a number, but the source of doubling of unity--duality. 1 x 2 is 2 x 1. It is the source of duality, eveness or balanced symmetry, and essentially static state. Three is also not a number, but the source of imbalance and asymmetry, a source of dynamic flow. The source of oddity or difference with these three qualities pr oduces number four, the first real number or the idea of quantity/quality an d dimensionality of the tetrahedron. Even and odd are established in the ideas of two and three. They are essential ly spatial or geometrical ideas relating to shape and form. They are the prototypes t hat establish the classes of number yet to come. All even numbers are non-primes because they are matched pairs or symmetric al sets of two. All odd numbers are potentially primes, being uneven non-symmetrical amounts. The first odd number to become a composite is nine. It is not a prime because of the initial occurrence of 3, which acts as a factor making 9 geometrically symmetrica l. Two odds make an even. 9 is axially odd, but radially even. The SYNDEX description of number behavior employs the overview of the cycloflex. It represents the reality of function that is both cyclic and oscillatory, i.e. both rota tional and reciprocating. In describing number behavior and dynamics, it becomes necessary to sh ow the interaction existing between palindromic and transpalindromic numbe rs--an interaction that is in essence a cyclic behavior. The retrograde functions progress to a point and then reverse in octave cycl es of four forward and four backward number events. This is a wave-cycle or cyc loflex."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Continuity in the description of the exemplary basewave cannot mean it in the sense of something uninterrupted because it must be curtailed on the upper limit of the Holotome for the sake of holistic unity. Continuity has given trouble to the number theorist because of the mind's insistance that any specific integer is an isolated idea entity and cannot be effected by anot her integer, several or even many times removed. But this is, in reality, the case when numbe r 9 is not a prime because of the usurpation of its \"primeness\" by 3. This transinteger dynamic is a passive dynamic. It happens as an acausal dete rminate which means the retrograde loops on the SYNDEX number maps are left to show the truth. The number reversals that purport to carry the exemplary wave are gestures of quasi- disconnective continuity because the relations must be shown that we may see how numbers interact as they flow towards some \"nothing\" called infinity. The prior reference to approach of holistic continuity at the end of a Hol otome is the final non-event of such a specific system. The octave is best deactivate d at these discrete points. It is predominantly the Holotomes that clarify the dist ribution of prime numbers, for the primes are symmetrically arrayed within the context of each holotome. The radial symmetry of the holtomes is, in itself, the geometrical proof of numeri cal coherency. That each subsequent holotome admits one, and only one, additional divisor establishes a rational medium between prime numbers and the sequence of specifi c compositry. Though the structure of the baseten continuum is a highly complex order, there are graphic methods by which the more important aspects of that order may be appreciabl y simplified. For example, there are very rare, often unique examples, of certain classes of number that occur seldom or even just once in the two-digit numbers and it was through the discovery of these rare or noble examples that the exemplary basewave cycle was disc overed. Once that cycle was isolated, it was a simple matter to extrapolate into the highe r order to secure the multiple digit cousins of those noble examples for comparisons to confirm t he sustained functions of the cycles being investigated. A basewave was long ago suspected by the classical number theorists, but its elus ive nature was due to the fact that it was not a singular wave form but a compound variety. A wave composed of the mutual interaction of square number nine and prime number eleven whose essential palindromic nature is connected with the transpalindrom ic aspects of the total numeric profile. The Synchrographs act as maps by which we may follow the progress of this exemplary wave cycle.

By and large, it is predominantly the holotomes that clarify the distribution of prim e numbers because the primes are symmetrically arrayed within the context of each holotome. And the number of primes in each holotome is determined by the total modular amount of the previous holotome. For example, Holotome E or #2520 contains 367 primes or just seven more than Holotome D which is #360 (360 x & = 2520) and Holotome D contains 72 primes, where #72 is the modular sum of the previous holotome. The fundamental intent of the initial ideas was to create a context wh ich would geometrically paraphrase the elements of numerical progression in a graphi c system that involves the primary elements of plane or two dimensional geometry.

In fact, most mathematicians can't comprehend one another's work. Few realize that mathematics has become progressively more specialized (with over 3500 subcategories), until even most mathematicians cannot understand each others theories and proofs. There are extremely few qualified critics. They don't even know what one another are doing and generally only have a coherent pattern of development in their own narrow specialty. There is no stated criteria for evaluating work in widely separated speci alties, for example nonlinear wave propagation and category-theoretic logic. Probably no one knows what is going on in both fields, and 95% of all professional mathematicians couldn't understand either one. No one in all of mathematics attempts to decide what is important and what is ephemeral. With all those subcategories, and over 200,000 theorems published a year, there is no assurance of their survival except \"survival of the fittest,\" what is deemed useful rises like cream, and gets used and remembered. What is valuable in math is based on our notion of the nature and purpose of mathematics, itself. Most professionals have learned to bypass the ontological and epistemological quest ion as irrelevant by cleaving to ontological materialism, and epistemologi cal empiricism. In practice, panels from many specialties are formed to determine gra nt funding. Since hardly anyone knows what is important outside of their narrow specialties, funding is political, rather than based on perceived merit.

He and his colleaugues were reacting against reductionism and trying to revive a holis tic perspective in science, lost since the expulsion of natural science as a unifie d, self-directed study of many subjects. His main thrust emphasized that real systems are open to, and interact with, their environments, and can acquire qualitatively new properties through emergence, resulting in continual evolution. Rather than reducing an entity to the properties of its parts or elements, syst ems theory focuses on the arrangement of and relations between the parts which connect them into a whole (holism). This particular organization determines a system, which is independent of the concrete substance of the elements. Thus, the same concepts and principles of organization underlie the different disciplines (physics, biology, technology, sociology, etc), providing a basis for their unification. Buckminster Fuller was an avid generalist and proponent of systems theory and interdisciplinary interaction. General Systems Theory was proposed by von Bertalanffy to provide a common meeting-ground for interdisciplinary studies. Fuller promoted generalism ove r the obvious alienating constraints of over-specialization, but he raised it to a high art in Synergetics, combining poetry, geometry, mathematics, architecture, et c. Scientists and humanists had long lamented the isolation of their respective disciplines. Bertrand Russell pointed out: \"It is noteworthy that modern Platonists, with few exceptions, are ignorant of mathematics, in spite of the immense importance that Plato attached to arithmetic and geometry, and the immense influence that they had on his philosophy. This is an example of the evils of specialization; a man must not write on Plato unless he has spent so much of his youth on Greek as to have had no time for the things that Plato thought important.\" We have dared to do so, for syndex theory is a platonic pursuit. In sharing theories from other disciplines, light can be shed metaphorically on theories from another area of inquiry, for example using physics theories to cr eate psychological models for therapy.

Perhaps this type of interdisciplinary task forc e is what she had in mind when she suggested mathematics continue to be examined in fresh ways: \"I would conjecture that the task of future mathematicians will be to collect their characteristics and analyze, when possible, every number i n its logical relationship to all others. This research should be undertaken in collaborations with physicists, musicians, and psychologists who are conversant with the empirical facts about the structural characterist ics of numbers in different mediums.\" Metaphors help identify how to apply discoveries to new situations, and may even guide efforts to develop new theories. At first, they may be a movement away from scientific rigor, but we need this flexibility in thinking. The interplay between rigor and metaphors can still be monitored to avoid confusion.

Metaphors are tools for getting into and out of assumptions, which might not be obvious just from looking at assumptions. Metaphor is a language for communicating about phenomena, and can lead to nonobvious conclusions. We need innovative quantitative measures derivable from verbal content to apply our work on a deeper level than only numerical reports. Immersing oneself in a concrete scientific thought, and then clearing the mi nd allows images to spring forth spontaneously which may be very relevant. The eg o interacts with the deeper mind in wonder yet with logic and active images. Einstein had his two passing trains which evoked his theories about time and his famous thought experiment where he imagined riding on a beam of light. Watson and Crick had the two snakes entwining which stimulated the concept of the DNA double helix. Kekule dreamed of a serpent biting its tail, and discovered the benzene ring."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Rather than relying on the gifts of association, correspondences, and dreams, we can also create an atmosphere and situations which give us the opportunity to discover and create rich metaphors, which expand, deepen, and lead to valid concepts. In new studies, metaphor is a great aid to communication. POST-QUANTUM PHYSICS AND THE 99 CYCLOFLEX \"Somewhere within that emptiness, we know, is a nucleus. We scan the space, and there it is, a tiny dot. At last, we have discovered something hard and solid, a reference point. But no--as we move closer to the nucleus, it too begins to dissolve. It too is nothing more than an oscillating field, waves of rhythm. Inside the nucleus are other organized fields, protons, neutrons, even smaller 'particles.' Each of these, upon our approach, also dissolves into pure rhythm.\" George Leonard, THE SILENT PULSE Our first reflectaphor comes from the leading edge of physics. Most terms in physics are metaphors, including time and matter. When Max Planck originally worked out his theory of Quantum Mechanics, he drew inferences from his extensive knowledge about the nature of harmonics in music. \"The most important point for our context is the fact that the spin [of an electron] is always a whole-number multiple of the most important natural constant of the microcosm, Planck's constant. When I say 'whole number multiple,' it is clear that we are dealing with a harmonic phenomenon. As a matter of fact, Max Planck, who was very much interested in music, supposedly was inspired to work out his quantum theory by the well-known phenomenon that the notes in an overtone scale jump from one whole number to the next.\" (Berendt, THE WORLD IS SOUND: NADA BRAHMA, p. 71). Non-orthodox POST-QUANTUM MECHANICS is only about two years old as of this 1998 writing. In modern number theory, integers in their entirety are considered a field, an active informational field. Extrapolating from physics , we can suggest a \"wave-particle\" complementarity theory of the number fie ld. This model reveals a key (here termed THE AURIC KEY) to the orderly distribution of prime numbers. It suggests a \"nonlocal\" connection bet ween \"distant\" numbers. Post-quantum BACKACTIVITY is the key idea. PQ M merely adds backactivity or a two-way process to all other QM processes. One of the main implications for this theory is the plausibility that not only does \"mind affect matter\" at the quantum level, but that \"matter affec ts mind\" in a backacting feedback loop. Proponents of PQM include David Bohm, Roger Penrose, Jack Sarfatti, Fred Alan Wolf, Nick Herbert, Basil Hiley, Stapp, etc."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Post-quantum mechanics uses the notion of a guide wave or quantum \"pil ot wave,\" which propogates backwards and forwards. We suggest, analogously, that there is an \"EXEMPLARY WAVE\" (99 CYCLOFLEX) which is a basic element of the structure of number -- a repeating cycle of 99. The wave permeates the field, and has no sources or other forms of dependence on the \"particle positions\" of integers, to the nth degree. As in PQM, we suggest a two-way relationship between wave (cycloflex) and particle (integers). Its source, as in physics, could be \"backactivity,\" th e inherent tendency to intrinsic self-organization. Sarfatti (1998) inform s us that, \"Self-organization emerges when the direct backactivity of the part icle suppliments the one-way relation of wave on particle on its guiding quant um pilot wave.\" There is a non-local connection between wave function and its corresponding physical particle. He also states that, \"the self organizational change of direct post-quantum backactivity is a self-referential kind of change.\" Since it is not a class ical mechanical wave (such as a sound wave), \"the quantum potential is independent of the strength (i.e. intensity) of the quantum field b ut depends only on its FORM.\" A good description of the nature of mind (and also apparently rational numbers) requires non-random, self-organizing, post-quantum mechan ics. In PQM, departure from randomness is the signature of sentience and inte nt. This statement is food for Syndex thought. In SYNDEX THEORY, prime number distribution departs from randomness, indicating an \"intentionality\" in the rhythm. Thus, we can conceive of the number continuum as a self-organizing \"living process.\" We can pursue the analogy of a two-way relationship or feedback-control loop between wave (CYCLOFLEX) and particle (integers). Syndex theory reveals a symmetry structure, a reversible engine of spontaneous non- random, orchestrated self-organization. CYCLOFLEX is a feedback-control loop. Orchestration is from the two-way relationship between guide wave and integers feeding back like the loop between a conductor and his orchestra. Classically, the quantum wave acts \"one-way\" as the \"unmoved mover\" of its manifesting particle without the latter acting directly on it in a s elf- organizing way. However, in PQM advanced influences propogate both forwards and backward in time from future to past. The past conditions the future causally, but there are also precursor waves travelling back in time from strange attractors in the future which \"pull\" us forward. The wave affects the particle and the particle then affects and condit ions the wave. This is a model for quantum mind over matter. If the \"influence\" acts"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"as a signal, it has the additional property that it can be locally decoded at the receiver without needing additional bits from the \"sender.\" To summarize, PQM introduces the notion of backactivity of direct action of the \"particle\" on its guiding quantum wave. Sarfatti points out that this forms a clos ed feedback loop which replaces fragility in the system with a robust self- organization. Syndex is a catalog of operations designed to evoke operations of increasing order, resulting from just such feedback loops and self- organization.. RHYTHM: THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES \"Music is a hidden arithmatic exercise of the soul, which does not know that it is dealing with numbers, because it does many things by way of unnoticed conceptions which with clear conception it could not do. Those who believe that nothing can happen in the soul of which the soul is not conscious are wrong. For this reason the soul, although not realizing that it is involved in mathematical computation, still sens es the effect of this unnoticeable forming of numbers either as a resultant feeling of well-being in the case of harmonies or as discomfort in the case of disharmonies.\" Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Rhythm is the basis of harmonic proportions and intervals, fundamental physical mechanisms. This harmonious equilibration was expounded upon by Pythagoras, father of Philosophy. Pythagorean thought formed the basis of the philosophy of Plato, and later Neo-Pythagoreans and Platonists, and greatly influenced th e development of western science. Pythagoras laid the foundation for a holistic science which integrated spirit ual, ethical, and metaphysical, as well as practical techniques. Pythagoras is famous for his axiomatic viewpoint that \"there is geometry in the humming of the strings. There is music in the spacing of the spheres.\" From Plotinus we hear, \" All music based upon melody and rhythm, is the earthly representative of heavenly music.\" And from Sufi Hazrat Inayat Khan, \"When one looks at the cosmos, the movements of the stars and planets, the law of vibration and rhythm, all perfect and unchanging, it shows that the cosmic system is working by the law of music, the law of harmony; and whenever that harmony in the cosmic system is lacking in any way, then in proportion disast er comes to the world, and its influence is seen in the many destructive f orces which are manifest there. The whole of astrological law and the science of magic and mysticism behind it, are based upon music.\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Pythagoras systematized the laws which allow the creation of stringed instruments: musical scale intervals (octaves, fifths, fourths, thirds). He recognized that these fundamentally abstract relationships pervade all c reation-- even matter irself. In music, as in nature, a wave is a shape in motion. Each note has a wave-shape. The octave comes from exactly doubling, or halving the string length, that is i n 1:2 proportion, while the harmonious fifth has a 2:3 ratio and the fourth 3:4. There is also the less obvious 4:5 interval of the third, and even less obvious consonances. Any tone in the overtone scale is higher than the preceding tone by precisely one whole number. These are the so-called harmonics. The lower the proportions of the numbers, the stronger the consonance, the more harmonious the sound of the two tones together. The primal polarity ratio of 1:2 is the most harmonious to our ears which are biologically geared to seven basic laws of harmony based on the primal law of whole-number quanta (which prevails in physics as well as music): THE SEVEN LAWS OF HARMONY 1. the overtone scale 2. the interval proportions 3. the division of the octave into twelve semitones 4. the difference between consonance and dissonance, the consonance growing as the proportion of the numbers gets smaller 5. the difference between major and minor, the major proportion being the most frequent by far 6. the predominance of the 1:2 polarity, the octave 7. the law of the Lambdoma (a column of numbers written in the form of the Greek letter lambda, whose right leg consists of whole number s going from one to infinity while the left leg contains the fractions of these same whole numbers, so that the coordinates of the open isosceles triangle follow the scale of overtones or undertones). There are correspondences in physics, acoustics, arithmatic, geometry, crystallography, cybernetics, theology and philosophy, the genetic code and I Ching. Harmonics are fundamental to our human biology as well, according to Haase: \"It has been found that the rhythmics of the human organism function utte rly harmonically--that is, the frequencies of pulse, breathing, blood circulati on, etc., as well as their combined activities. We can observe that these rhythm s are strictly coordinated, primarily in terms of the numbers one through four, wh ich"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"are able to form the intervals octave (1:2), fifth (2:3), fourth (3:4), twelfth ( 1:3), and double octave (1:4).\" These realizations led to the contemplation of the abstract ratio of numbers and geometric figures, and were instrumental in the discovery of the harmonic mean (pitch ratio between two neighboring musical notes). In general, means and proportions have special significance as symbols of the integral order of the universe. Ancient Greek music employed the Diatonic Scale, which progressed downward in pitch. It has weird quarter-tone modes and modalities and was used in plaintive songs of temple and church, sung as haunting chants. The Hindus, on the other hand used an unbridled scale of 22 alternative notes of variable sequence. The Arabs used various modes in quarter tones, while other cultures explored third-, sixth-, eighth-, twelfth-, and even sixteenth-tone music. Our modern, western ears prefer the tones of the \"Equable Keyboard.\" However, even though offering few perfect intervals and triads in keys other than its own, the diatonic scale is interesting because all its tonal differences in frequency are multiples of the prime number 11. Still, it failed utterly as a practical all-around tool of music. So much for old models. A useable scale is, after all, just a tool of music. We will return to some of the basics of number theory in the thought of these philosophers later. First, we will show an example of music related to our theory of backactivity in the number continuum. For this, we need to visit a composer with an ear for physical theory. The RETROGRADE FUGE , or CRAB CANON , was arguably J.S. Bach's most significant contribution to the science of musicology, at least in terms of Syndex. If properly understood, it makes valid the term \"musiconomy\" as a legitimate term, (the laws of rhythmic structure). The parallels of nature's scenarios to the Retrograde Fuge are endless. T hat it took 6000 years to produce a musician they would once again use the retrograde function in designing music is incredible. Ancient cuneiform musical notation has revealed extensive use of this fundamental rhythmical format, as discovered by a Berkeley musicologist in 1979. We can conjecture that the music of the spheres would naturally be an example of a point at which the orbiting planets would unfold in a perfect reversal of cyclic patterning. Otherwise, what rhythm would be significant at all? The structures of number behavior in the so-called baseten system reveals a retrograde function in itself. This has been demonstrated in the synchrogra phic representation of Holotome E which is a geonumerical picture of the number 2520, the first and lowest number divisible by all eight base digits (one is not a number)."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Base ten, then, is actually an octave with a 9th null event which occurs between nine and eleven or at number ten where the zero first comes into effect, by enspiraling the number continuum. Since nine times eleven equals 99 and 49.5 is one half of 99, a perfect retrograde pattern occurs through the interaction of nine and eleven or 99 and its multiples. What is musical notation without an instrument with a full octave range? Twelve- tone is the dominant alternative system.

The self is th e archetype of order par excellence. The structure of the mandala is arithme tical, for \"whole\" numbers are likewise archetypes of order.

Thus, the study of the inherent rhythms of the natural number"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"sequence was of paramount importance. There were specific numbers which were considered divine manifestations, and in fact corresponded with various gods. The studies of geometry, music, astronomy, and color were therefore sacred arts, as shown in the Prayer to the Tetractys: \"Bless us divine number, Thou who generatest gods and men! O Holy, Holy Tetrac tys, thou that containest the root and the source of the eternally flowing creati on! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, the all-bounding, the fir st born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the keyholder of all.\" Plato and Pythagoras both dealt with geometry as an aspect of number, (triangles , squares, oblongs, rectangles, etc.). Plato, of course, has his series of ideal regul ar and irregular forms which naturally had a plurality (number) of faces and vertic es. The kernal of Pythagorean wisdom is contained in a primal BASE TEN ARRAY, the divine TETRACTYS, a pyramidal array of 10 points which contain a great myste ry of universal nature. The TETRACTYS is made up of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, which add up to 10, arrayed in the form of a perfect triangle. This figure is also reflecte d in slightly different form as the qabalistic Tree of Life. The four levels of the array contain not only the basic intervals--fourth, fifth, oc tave, and double octave--but also point, line, plane, and solid. The unequal numbers of this cryptic formula may be incomprehensible except to the initiated. Psychologists such as Carl Jung and Edward Edinger have explicated its psycholo gical meaning and symbolism as an expression of the epitome of the process of personality development, with four stages and three steps of transition. (Insert graphic of TETRACTYS containing VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM) The matrix of the Tetractys represents a qualitative field--dynamic i nternal structure. In it the ontological and logical ordering of numbers is translated into rhythmical and geometric images. There is no need to invoke the numerals as elements of an infi nite series, but rather we imagine them as the \"ensemble\" of a finite series. According to Jungian analyst Marie Louise vonFranz in NUMBER AND TIME (19 ), \"The preconscious aspect of natural numbers points to the idea of a numerical field in which individual numbers figure as energic phenomena or rhythmical configurations. This 'field,' which we take to represent the structural outlines of the collecti ve unconscious, is organized around the central archetype of the Self. For this reason historical mandala structures deserve particular attention. In corresponding \"cosmic models\" and mathematical representations of God, the first four natural numbers predominate to an exceptional degree, just as they did in the systematic divinatory techniques of the past.\" Plato and Pythagoras both dealt with geometry as an aspect of number. Plato's ser ies of regular and irregular forms naturally had a plurality (number) of faces and vertices. In"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"PQM terms, \"the forms\" of Plato are, perhaps, robust attractors in the super quant um gravity potential of the three-geometry of our actual expanding universe. They r epresent \"eternal values,\" whose content can theoretically be imprinted upon and influence the quantum mind field. Jung found a vast psychological significance in the number four. Jungians conclude that \" mankind's repeated attempts to establish an orientation toward wholeness posses a quaternary structure, and appears to correspond to an archetypal psychic predisposition in man.\" vonFranz, Number and Time, p. 115. We can equate four disciplines with four modes of being: physics = physical; music = emotional; psychology = thinking; metaphysics = intuition. They equate with Jung's four functions of cognition: sensation, feeling, thinking, and intuition. It is a cross-cultural phenomenon from sources as widely separated as the Chine se, Native Americans, Asiatic Indians, Incan and Mayan, and pre-Christian Mediter ranean-- this tendency to cleave to fourness in modelling reality. Some of the Pythagoreans regarded four as the essence of justice, being four-square in one's dealings . According to Edinger, \"One of Jung's major discoveries is the psychological significance of the number four as it relates to the symbolism of psychic wholeness and the four functions. The significance of the quaternity is basic to his whole theory of the psyche, both as regards its structure and its developmental goal, the individuation process. We are thus particularly alert to quaternity symbolism as it appears in dreams and in the imagery of myth and folklore. However, there are other numerical motifs which are commonly encountered.\" \"Jung describes Pythagorean number symbolism which is pertinent here. THE NUMBER ONE AS THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL NUMBER IS, STRICTLY SPEAKING, NOT A NUMBER AT ALL. One as unity and totality exists prior to the awareness of numbers which requires a capacity to distinguish between separate, discrete entities. Thus, \"one\" symbolically corresponds to the uroboric state prior to the creation and separation of things. Two is the first real number since with it is born the possibility of discrimi nating one thing from another. Two symbolizes the act of creation, the emergence of the ego from the original state of unity.\" The Tetractys is inherent in our biology: \"The entire microcosm is replete with harmonic occurrences. The long strings of nuclei c acid in DNA are structured precisely according to the Pythagorean Tetractys, the fourfold subdivision of the octave (octave, fifth, fourth and major second). The Pythagoreans attributed magic power to the Tetractys and called it sacred. This same structure is almost ubiquitous in those mysterious processes whereby inorganic structures are transformed into organic life,\" according to Berendt, p. 69. The four-fold structure holds sway in physics as Minkowski and Einstein's four- dimensional model of the universe, and the four forces of nature (nuclear, electric al, weak interaction, and gravitational). It reminds of Fuller's notion that nature operat es in +4, -4 event octaves."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Sometimes psychic and physical events coincide as synchronicities, revea ling a \"common meaning.\" In this case the nature of the psyche is revealed as the transcend ent unity of existence using the rhythms of natural numbers. VonFranz tells us that, \" These numbers illustrated some of the most primitive and basic forms of the spirit. When we take into account the individual characteristics of natural numbers, we can actually demonstrate that they produce the same ordering effects in the physical and psychic realms; they therefore appear to constitute the most basic constants of nature expressing unitary psychophysical reality.\" Number and Time, p. 303. So, there is a common basis between numbers and the psyche. Numbers appar ently order both the physical and psychic worlds. Building on the diagram of the Tetractys, Edward Edinger imagines a +4 descent a nd a -4 ascent, a movement of the differentiating ego separating from undifferenti ated objective wholeness into subjective experiential development, and then moving back toward the One in a recursive reunification. This echoed in the old alchemical axiom of Mar ia Prophetessa: \"One becomes two: two becomes three: and out of the third comes the One as t he fourth.\" Or another version: \"One, and it is two: two, and it is three: and three, and it is four: and four, and its i s three, and three, and it is two, and two, and it is one.\" These stages symbolize the transformational process: \"This first stage of the coniunctio...brings about the union of soul and spirit over and against the body; they link up as partners against the body. In the second stage, united spirit and soul reunite with the body. In the third stage, the previously united spirit-soul- body is now united with the world, and conversely (recursively) the Self, or source. This is characterized by independent autonomous being. Original unity has been differentiated into a fourfold multiplicity. After living fully in the world the task of individuation becomes the ascent back up through the number series of the Tetractys.\" (insert diagram Edinger, Mysterium Lectures, p.282) "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Diamond Body: Buckminster Fuller and The Qabala by Iona R.

Aleister Crowley, The Dragon-Flies SACRED GEOMETRY: According to most creation stories, out of primal Nothingness, the All or Everything emerges or emanates. Paradoxically, everything seems to come from nothing. H ow does nothing become something? Energy \"crystallizes\" into matter in the w omb of empty space, a dynamic Void. Mass is simply a form of energy. This process is structured by an underlying, invisible, geometrical lattice. Actually, it i s pre- geometric. Because it has no true physical existence, it is metaphysical (beyond physics). This threshold of matter, where nothing becomes something, is of great philosophical interest. Actually, materialism (a natural philosophy) is a theory of metaphysics. It is metaphysical thinking to consider static matter as a primary reality. In fac t, any attempt to describe reality is metaphysical speculation. In its dynami c form matter cannot be separated from energy. Energy is a property of matter, which can be considered potential energy. The mystic believes in matter, but beli eves it is more than science has yet discovered. Even before Western science began, mysti cs believed that mind, consciousness, or spirit is a property of matter. It hardly matters, philosophically, if you consider it as manifesting force or mani festing spirit. The nature of reality is that matter-energy must be taken together .The t heory of relativity conceives of this single substance as a distortion of the struc ture of space. Physicist Ian Barbour writes that, \"...in quantum theory, separate particle s seem to be temporary and partial manifestations of a shifting pattern of waves that comb ine at one point, dissolve again, and recombine elsewhere; a particle begins to look like a local outcropping of a continuous substratum of vibrational energy.\" That vibrational energy is governed by the laws of probability. But what subtle forces underlie matter-energy and space-time? All f orm and power are latent within the void. The Heart Sutra tells us that, \"Form is not other than"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Void, Void is not other than Form.\" This implies that our human form is not othe r than void, and biophysics shows this to be true. Our physical makeup is largel y emptiness. If we conceive of humans as being most fundamentally electro magnetic entities, instead of chemical beings, we can imagine our finer existence as wave- fronts in space. Our personal \"space\" is not utterly empty, but cannot be c onceived apart from our matter exhibiting itself in particular ways, i.e. as \"waves.\" Yet, the void state, or primal matrix, is \"cosmic zero,\" and proportionately our most fundamental reality. It is part of the surrealistic quantum realm. I t lies within us all, for the relative space between our atoms is astronomical. This is th e ground state of existence which mystics seek in their meditation, moving beyond mind and maya . It is that state of consciousness where outer perceptions cease, and consciousness is free to simply be . Throughout the centuries, various geometrical forms have been revered as expressions or metaphors of higher spiritual truths. These sacred for ms and symbols are a natural part of the collective consciousness which emerges in every generation. We project them outwardly from within our psyche because they ar e so fundamental to our existence. That apprehension is intuitive. Certain typ ical forms recur in meditation and ceremonial practice, worldwide. When something emerges from nothing, it does so via non-Euclidean geometry, coming to occupy space/time. Einstein used non-Euclidean geometry to e xplain the relativity of time and space as the geometry that is produced by matter or mat ter by geometry. The perception of the transcendental or metaphysical aspects of geometry is intuitive. There are examples of philosophical geometry or geometrical p hilosophy from around the world. These traditions are found in India, China, Egypt, and Great Britain, to name a few. Plato, Archimedes, and the Pythagoreans based much of their philosophical speculation around the nature of geometrical form, suggesting that mathemat ics and structural forms had ultimate status. Our modern science has nev er forsaken the tradition of seeking the understanding of forms that provide shap e and meaning to physical reality. Euclidean geometry describes the nature of the human s cale, but non-Euclidean models the cosmos and microcosm. More and more intricate forms of measurement became the basis of the scientific method. Eventually, th is led to modern topology--the study of those properties of geometric figures or soli d bodies that remain invariant under certain transformations. Heisenberg explained that, \"The elementary particles of modern physi cs can be transformed into each other exactly as in the philosophy of Plato.\" In \"sacred topology\", the relationships are more than metaphorical. Metaphysical and physi cal reality coincide. This is abundantly illustrated in R. Buckminster Fuller's geometrical tour de force , SYNERGETICS I & II . Fuller demonstrates, via synergetics, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, because of the relativity of forces. In our universe, as more complex systems are built up , new properties appear that were not foreshadowed by the parts alone. These em ergent properties include life, conscious awareness, and beauty."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Plato's Academy in Athens had a policy: \"You are not allowed to enter here, unl ess you know geometry.\" In the dialogue, Meno , Plato describes Socrates teaching geometry to a slave. In true Socratic form, he does not instruct him directly. R ather, he elicits knowledge from the slave which he did not know he possess ed. The diagrams themselves elicit the buried intuitive knowledge of a world inhabited by the gods and by the divine \"Forms.\" In Plato's view, before birth we were familiar with purely mathematical \" objects\" and relations, as well as moral ideals or values. He alleged that we lost this knowledge at birth, but can recover it through revelation. For Plato, the virtues paled in comparison with the highest capacity of the soul, which is the m ystical beholding of the eternal. Mystics tell us the divine is formless. Actual space is not empty, but the possibility has always been a controversi al problem in philosophy. Aristotle found the concept of a total void unacceptabl e. Scientists still cannot make a perfect experimental vacuum. Astronomy s hows us that matter is averagely distributed, with roughly as much matter betw een the stars as there is within them. Yet, there are large voids in space, with stars cl ustered on the outer edges of these bubbles of void. The preponderance is of volumes of empty space over volumes of matter. So, the characteristic feature of the universe is not matter, but empty space. Again, most of the interior of the atom is empty, as is the space occupied by th e galaxies, and the vast regions which separate them. Stars, atoms, and the vacuum are a seamless whole. The notion of the eternal nature of sacred emptiness is echoed in moder n quantum theory. This is not ordinary, but dynamic and receptive emptiness. The cent ral concept in Quantum Field Theory is that of the field , which exists everywhere and everywhen. It is a field of curved space/time. Matter is not separate fro m its surrounding space. The field can take the form of quanta or particles. It i s the fundamental physical entity, the only physical reality. The field contains the potentiality of all possible states or conditions in the universe. Of these states, the most fundamental is the Ground State, (or \"vacuum state\"). Matter is rare in the universe. Most of it consists of a very volatile, excited, i onic plasma. Only 5% of matter is neither too hot, nor too dilute, to congeal as a solid, liquid, or gas. This form of matter is so rare it has been described as 'tr ace contaminants.' Yet, some form of matter is essential to all activity. All matter is in moti on. Activity is the essence of being. From the \"cosmic zero\", everything -- the tot ality of \"excited states\" -- arises by creative processes. It is also the state into which e verything subsides by absorption processes. The ground state is characterized by t he fact that it stretches to infinity, uniform and changeless. It is the same everywh ere and everywhen because of the identity of space/time.

Matter is thus a temporar y manifestation of the Void. The so-called \"cosmic zero\" was modeled by geometer/philosopher Fulle r in the figure he called Vector Equilibrium, (V.E.). It might actually claim to be the first \"Buckyball,\" the one Fuller himself described. This geometry is the precursor of the new elemental' Fullerenes.' The V.E. geometry has been recognized for a long time. It was one of the thirteen Archimedian solids, the cuboctahedron. But the Greeks were fascinated with regular forms whose faces were all the same, such as the cube. They failed to understand the delicate balancing act th e cuboctahedron symbolizes. They simply did not notice that Vector Equil ibrium is pristine equanimity because they were looking elsewhere. The Greek s never really comprehended the energic or energetic properties of Vector Equil ibrium, i.e. dynamic stability. They had a static, non-relativistic view of natural philosoph y. It remained for Fuller to assert that, \"zero pulsation in the Vector Equ ilibrium is the nearest approach we will ever know to eternity and god.\" The conceptual m odel is the closest our minds and senses can come to that cosmic realization, s hort of mystical revelation. Mind alone cannot fathom the depth of this Void. Geom etry is a construct of the intellect. The V.E. center is primal \"emptiness.\" It is a mathematical anomaly whe re the normal laws of the space/time continuum break down. It is not a symbol of ultim ate order. It looks like a very rational, orderly system, but it is ultimately irration al. It defies logic. V.E. is the breeder of wave-particle duality, the uncertain ty principle, and non-locality at the quantum level. It is a zone of neutral resonance wher e waves can pass through waves without interference, according to Fuller. Yet, it never physically exists as a structure, since nature abhors a vacuum. In quantum mechanics a system can never have an energy of exactly zero. There is no such thing as absolute emptiness. However, the minimal motion of the grou nd state is called zero point energy, or zero point motion. Cosmic zero exists, paradoxically, in the realm of the psyche (our conceptualization) and in quant um reality in the atomic nucleus expressed as force. It is the form of formle ssness, the root metaphor. It also forms the roots of the cosmic Tree of Life, since the re is a fine-to-non-existent line between organic and inorganic matter on the q uantum scale. Physics is the patterns of organic energy, all of which are dynamic, alive. Mass is energy, so the subatomic world is always restlessly in motion. Inert matter is full of motion when we look closely at it . The activity of matter is its essence. Vector Equilibrium emanates/condenses from a center in twelve fu ndamental directions.

Vector Equilibrium has the same surface area as a sphere, yet c ontains no volume, i.e. it contains \"nothing.\" The Vector Equilibrium system has 12 vertices, 8 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 32 planes. It is omnidirectional equilibrium, symbolically and physically s peaking. As such, it is a perfect symbol for \"holding the tension of the opposites,\" or \" uniting the opposites.\" Yet, it is more than a metaphor. It is an archetypal image whi ch bridges the macrocosm with the microcosm. It is a living example of the H ermetic Axiom, \"As Above, So Below,\" uniting spiritual and literal reality. V.E. makes i t possible to make conceptual models of other dimensions (hyperspace), mathematically and mystically. In the V.E. figure, equilibrium between positive and negative is zero. It is the equalization of the forces of push/pull, radiation/gravitation, or tension/compression. Fuller alleged it\" represents the limits of t he mind's ability to conceptualize 'in'.\" For Fuller, all of space/time is undergird with a p re-geometric matrix, which is an infinite field of vector equilibria. An entire un iverse can be seeded from one V.E., self-generating to fill all space/time. There may be no ultimate physical building-block of matter, but there is one single entity that u ndergirds and composes everything in the universe, according to Fuller. The basic ele ment of the universe is dynamic patterns. This field constitutes a \"cosmic blueprint\" which Fuller call ed the Isotropic Vector Matrix (I.V.M.), a living continuum. The allocation of divinity to this \"mother of all fields\" marks its archetypal character. As a variation on the theme of Celes tial Goddess, it symbolizes the embodiment of nature. Like a modern Isis, it iterates the theme of the underlying, inseparable cosmic web or net, connecting all. Th e living Void gives birth to all phenomenal forms. It pulsates with the rhythm of cr eation and destruction of material particles. Another goddess, Nuit, is the ess ence of Infinite Space. She is infinite energy density pervading the entire c osmos. She is the receptivity of the void to the wavelength of radiation. Adjusting the geometry of t he void influences the propagation of radiation. The goddess Ma-at, or Balance, is another expression of the same universal V.E. energy. The Upanishads identifies Brahman with the void: Brahman is life. Brahman is joy. Brahman is the Void. Joy, verily, that is the same as the Void. The Void, verily, that is the same as joy. The geometry of Vector Equilibrium is inferred from that of closest-p acked spheres of equal radius. It just happens to be the geometry which underlies all m atter since it is found in the nucleus of all atoms as sub-atomic force. Here, in the int erior of the atoms, Newtonian physics does not apply. This is a probabilistic, acausal world. Here synchronicity prevails over chronicity. This uniform geometrical field, with the property of Divine conscious ness, is the basis for a geometrical model of reality spanning the abyss between the metaphysical and the physical. It is not the first model in history to attem pt to do so."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"There is an ancient geometrical model which shares a common framework with the Vector Equilibrium. THE GEOMETRY OF THE QABALA The ancient mystical system of the Qabala is formulated around the geometri cal glyph known as the Tree of Life. This sacred geometry system came down to u s through Judaism and Hermetic Philosophy. It is one of the main currents of t hought in the Western Occult Tradition. A mathematically accurate image of the T ree of Life can be constructed by dividing a vertical line into four equal length s and filling in four intersecting circles, using a fourth of the line as radius. The nexus points are the positions of the 10 spheres, and connecting paths join the centers of th e spheres. GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION OF THE TREE OF LIFE 1. Begin by imagining a vertical line, A-Z 2. Divide the line into four equal segments. 3. Using the segment length for a radius, inscribe four interpenetratin g circles whose centers lie along the vertical line. These represent the Four Worlds, or Planes of existence. 4. The points-of-intersection are related to the numbers of Spheres on the Tree of Life as diagramed 1 - 10. 5. With vertical lines (Red) join 3-5-8 for Left-Handed Pillar of Severity ; join points 2-4-7 for the Pillar of Mercy . Line 1-6-9-10 forms THE MIDDLE PILLAR . 6.

It symbolizes all ways of being and becoming. Like t he quantum field, it contains the potentiality of all possible states or condi tions in the universe. It is just the ancient way of saying it, and it turns out to be phys ically provable. The ancient model coincides with state-of-the-art physics. T he 10 spheres and 22 paths yield a total of 32 planes of reference, like the Vector Equilibri um."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"This \"tree\" was first described in writing in the Sephir Yetzirah , or The Book of Formation . Legend says the book came to Abraham, from God, through an angel. Today, we might say it was \"channeled\" from a divine source. Jewish scholar, Gershom Scholem dates the workaround the third to sixth century. However, t here is some astronomical evidence that the system does date from the time of Abraham, approximately 4,000 years ago. Whether the patriarch was the first to receive the revelation, or not, th is archetypal consciousness map encodes a system of spiritual wisdom and growth in geo metrical form. It describes the nature of the universe, consciousness, and the cr eation. It seems to have intuitively anticipated the discovery of the physical nature of reality. The glyph itself was used as a meditation devise by students of the Qabala, an oral wisdom tradition. One aim of the qabalists was to see the Tree always, everywhe re, in everything. Another essential doctrine of Qabala is that humans possess a \" spirit body\" that can detach itself from the physical body and ascend to higher plane s. Most modern students of Qabala are familiar with the standard 2-dimensi onal representation of the Tree, which is drawn \"flat,\" even though the circ les are always conceived of as spheres. There is also a long tradition of a so-called 4-dimensi onal Tree of Life diagram, based on The Book of Formation . This geometrical figure consists of two interfacing pyramids surrounding a central core, within an enclosing cube. This octahedron-within-a-cube happens to be the crystal structure of diamond, a face-centered-cubic lattice. Recalling that Abraham is also the patriar ch of the Moslems, it is interesting to note reference to a spiritual body, a \"diam ond body\", in the writing of Shaikh Amad Ahsa'i from the 13th century. Speaking of a sub stance akin to that of the medieval Philosopher's Stone, he equated the \"diamond bo dy\" with the \"Resurrection Body\" of the faithful believer in the Paradi se of the future Aeon. For the Qabalists, meditation on this figure provided a mystical body as a vehicl e for consciousness in imaginal space. This diamond body was used during m editation to enter the inner court of Divinity, symbolized by the center of the fi gure. Here the Beginning and End of time are co-temporaneous, space ceases to be a hind rance, and the mystic beheld the ecstatic vision of the Lord on His Throne. The geo metry was a \"gateway\" to another dimension of experience. This Alpha-Omega point has all the physical qualities of VectorEquilibr ium. The ancient meditation practice was known as Merkabah mysticism, and those wh o practiced it called themselves, \"Riders in the Chariot.\" They claimed to see into the future. This insinuates that the figure is a \"vehicle\" for moving consci ousness through imaginal time and space. It seems to be a metaphysical \"time mach ine,\" or inter-dimensional gateway. As in most design or mandala meditations, the aspirant pictures him or he rself at the center of the figure through visualization, contemplation, and identif ication. Through this process of centering, these mystics came to know themse lves and God."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Perhaps they learned, as Fuller later discovered, of the unusual anomalous conditions of perfect equilibrium. This meditation provided a speci fic technique for escaping from time. Its realization meant instantaneous enlightenme nt, a paradoxical leap out of Time. It yields transcendence. Occultist, Paul Foster Case published an array of this type in his book, The Tarot (1947). Aware of the ancient mystic practice, he included the figure in his study of Qabala, calling it alternately the Key of the Cosmos and Numbers, or the Cube of Space. Again, we have the form of the octahedron-within- a-cube. Vector Equilibrium and the Cube of Space are mathematical duals, or reciprocal s of one another. They \"jitterbug\" back and forth as the figure grows outward to fill al l space. They are two ways of looking at the same geometrical phenomena. Case pointed out that its construction was based on the six-pointed Star of David, (or Shield of David), also known as \"The Star of the Macrocosm.\" His descripto rs of zero as a sacred, empty, consciousness field reiterate the qualities of Vector Equilibrium. Zero is a symbol of the absence of quality, quantity, or mass. Thus it denotes absolute freedom from every limitation whatever. It is a sign of the infi nite and eternal Conscious Energy, itself No-Thing, though manifest in every thing. It is That which was, is, and shall be forever; but it is nothing we can name. Boundless infinitely potential, living light, it is the rootless root of all things, of all activities, of all modes of consciousness. In it are included all imaginabl e and unimaginable possibilities, but it transcends them all. The Qabalists cal l it: (a) No-Thing; (b) The Boundless; (c) Limitless Light. Pure Conscious En ergy, above and beyond thought, to us it is Superconsciousness. With their fascination for completely regular figures, the Greeks devi sed a way of establishing XYZ coordinates within a cube. Our science and method of ori entation has been stuck with that model ever since. However, nature's own most ec onomical coordination is in triangles and tetrahedra, rather than squares or cubes. VectorEquilibrium is more in line with modern Quantum Mechanic al models than the Newtonian XYZ. It expresses more degrees of freedom. So, close examination of the underlying geometry of the Tree of Life reveals that the ancients were not lacking a very deep intuitive awareness of the true stru cture of matter and the universe. The underlying geometrical matrix of the multi - dimensional Tree is, in fact, Vector Equilibrium. To find the commonali ty -- the harmony --the figure of the V.E. must be subjected to a transformation proc ess, i.e. rotation. To bring the two figures into synch, simply rotate the V.E. to any edge of its containing cube. If the 3-dimensional V.E. is drawn flat, the inherent geom etry of the Tree of Life is immediately revealed, including some of the so-called \"hidden\" paths."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"A symbolic representation of the optimal union of opposites, it means in psychological terms, \"holding the tension of the opposites.\" This is the essence of the Tree of Life. The theme of union of opposites has reverberated down throu gh the ages. It was the process/goal of alchemy, creation of the Philosopher's Stone. Now, Jungian psychology carries the torch of this philosophical pursuit. B oth Vector Equilibrium and the Tree of Life express this most elegantly an d economically in terms of minimal graphic elements. Diagram of Tree of Life nested within a Vector Equilibrium. By combining the vectors of a V.E. nested within a cube, it is possible to der ive the nexus points on which to construct the entire Tree of Life. In The Anatomy of the Body of God , (1925), Frater Achad, (magickal name of Charles Stansfield Jones), revealed an amplified Tree of Life projecting from a center in six dire ctions. Rather than a flat depiction, his revelation showed Trees radiating in the four cardinal directions, plus up and down. This is another variation on the the me of XYZ coordinates. Yet, V.E. can be shown, once again, to be the skeletal matrix on which the figure congeals. The geometrical duals yield all the necessary n exus points to form the entire Tree of Life, including the 11th mystery sphere, Daat h. Achad's advice for modern Qabalists says, ...since the \"Tree\" is everywhere the same in every part of space, once its general attributions are fixed in the mind, it is not well to confuse ourse lves by too much attempt at progressed expansion of the idea. Rather we would return and contemplate the Centre from which All proceeds, thus obtaining the Pu re Essence Here and Now. This concept of a self-generating, self-iterating, all-space filling, crys talline system seems to herald the modern discovery of the fractal nature of the univer se. Whether we look at the macrocosmic, mesocosmic, or microcosmic level, we find the sa me principle operating. By following any portion of the consciousness map \"backwards\" and \"downwards\" to the center, we have a conceptual means of entering that most pristine state of consciousness where All become s No-Thing.

Yet they are the invisible lattice, or barebones, of our physical and sp iritual life, of all life and manifestations. In this pre-geometry we have a blueprint for the formation of all matter, all form. This is the geometry of closest-packed sphe res in the nucleus of the atom. Yet, Vector Equilibrium is more than an expression of nuclear forces . It is \"an endlessly interlinked chain of atomically self-renewing links of omn i-equal strength or of an omni-directionally interlinked chain matrix of ever renewed atomic links, \"according to Fuller. No single configuration of matter persists indefi nitely. All is change and recombination. V.E. describes the most economical lines of move ment within the atomic nucleus. And, it also is the structural matrix of a very an cient and sophisticated consciousness-changing technology. Through it we rememb er deep knowledge of our true nature. Noting the metaphysical aspect of physics, physicist Wolfgang Pauli said, \"We should now proceed to find a neutral, or unitarian, language in which every conc ept we use is applicable as well to the unconscious as to matter, in order to overcome this wrong view that the unconscious psyche and matter are two things. \" We have, in the V.E. model, a language or information transfer system that bridges both the physical and the spiritual, Fuller says, \"In this model the phys ical and metaphysical share the same design.\" The mundane and supernatural share the same design: \"As Above, So Below.\" It creates a mystical revelation describ ed as ecstatic, blissful, joyful, transcendental. Goethe's Faust opens with the mage contemplating the qabalistic, geome tric design of the Macrocosm: What jubilation bursts out of this sight Into my senses--now I feel it flowing, Youthful, a sacred fountain of delight, Through every nerve, my veins are glowing.

In Aion , psychologist Carl Jung reiterates the identity of psyche and matter: Psyche cannot be totally different from matter, for how otherwise could it move matter? And matter cannot be alien to psyche, for how else could matter produce psyche? Psyche and matter exist in the same world, and each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal action would be impossible. To know ourselves is to know the nature of cosmos. The yogis and masters tell us that matter is mind or consciousness at its most fundamental or gross leve l. From the dawn of history mankind has employed sacred geometries for metaph ysical orientation and creating consciousness maps. Most maps of the psyche imply a \"journey\" either to the heights or depths of experience. Long ago Heraclit us alleged, and mystic artist William Blake agreed, that the way up and the way down are one and the same. Metaphysical models usually speak of an ascent to utopian heights or \"inner planes.\" Psychological models are usually concerned with descents into th e subconscious depths and use subterranean imagery. These depths wer e the familiar territory of shamans for millennia. Both the occult and transpersonal psyc hology models include heights and depths of human experience. Maslow introd uced the concept of \"peak experiences\" to psychology. We may have the erroneous idea that peaks, or heights, or \"highs\" are \"good.\" This is mainly because we are enculturated to strive upward. This is only one of a myriad of states of consciousness, and it belongs to manically over-achieving heroic ego. Negatively directed, this same energy can produce an all-time high in a soci opath or criminally insane personality, during a heinous act. All that is \"up\" is n ot \"good\"; and, all that is \"down\" is not \"evil.\" This misapprehension is the root of the notion of a spirit/matter duality, where all matter is inherently \"evil\". In thi s belief system, \"we exist: therefore we are sinful.\" Yet, our heights and depths cont ain the first- hand experiential knowledge that 'we are one.'

Quantitative notation and geometry are the conceptual tools by which we formulate our standard of physical description and dialogue, i.e. systematic science. The first concern of synchrographics is maximum information expressed via minimal graphic elements. Correspondences, such as those between geometry, number, and color, and frequency of divisibility form an integral part of the system. There is some agreement among astro-archaeological historians that the ea rliest evidence of technological civilization is a mere 6000 years old. The author is concerned here with the original metrological formula (founded upon measurements of the earth and precession of the equinoxes). Our present technological situation is founded on these systems of measurement and their geodesic bases.. Reflecting on his thirty year study of the synergetic interaction of numb er and geometry via synchrographics, Marshall (as author of the Auric Key) realized that the system of number regard he had investigated for half his lifetime produced the exact same system of metrology that had initiated an d proliferated industrial technology, during the historical era.

Radical discoveries are a source of continual reevaluation of historical opinion. The Auric Key is a remedy for verbal deficiency in describing how a cyclic base evolves to cyclic accumulation of quantitative notation, in a +4, -4 octave wavecycle. The scientifically systematic principle which synchrographics rests upon is of such simplistic design that we cannot help but wonder why such an obvious psychological tool was not used through the centuries for teaching. All of the individual elements that comprise this discipline were well known from deepest antiquity. What we call numbers are a continuum of a finite set of graphic signs which form a cycle which is determined by the quantitative amount of the base set or prima ry individual signs. Inasmuch as neither zero nor one are numbers in themselves divisible, that which we call baseten is actually an octave set of actual numbe rs (members). Pythagoras also did not consider the duad (dyad) a true number. In regards to the cyclation of number, only an octave can progress in what would be termed an exemplary cycle or a cycle that may progress in an unbroken compounding of cycles. The exemplary wave is an escalation of null event lapping of each cycle to the next. In our usual regard of the base ten number we see the addition of each digit as the point at which the cycle begins anew. It is at this very point where serious confusion occurs in that this \"point\" is being counted as a member. It is merely a position upon which the cycle revolves and therefore may not be included in any terminal tally of quantitative magnitudes, i .e. 100 equals 99. R. Buckminster Fuller treated this problem by calling base ten an octave with a ninth null event. The null event was regarded as nine being the proxy of the one that he counted as a legitimate number. I show this octave cycle in a very different way: when one considers the multiples of nine and disregards the initial none, the octave cyclation becomes quite clear: Between 45 and 54 a reversal occurs and the four following multiples are retrograde companions of the prior four multiples, i.e. four forward and four reverse event octaves. This shows that base ten is actually base eight, an octave loop."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"In view of the foregoing, the nave or turnaround point of the octave is at 49.5. It is NOT 50, as claimed by Fuller, and never subsequently corrected in SYNERGETICS III, as he would have liked. The symmetrical perfection of synchrographics results from the expedient of reversing the octave between numbers, instead of upon a number. Turnaround is at 50, between 49 and 50. THE AURIC KEY 2520 is the first and lowest numerical sum which is divisible by all eight basic numbers. By the simple expedient of de-strapolation by the first 4 prime numbers, we discover the Holotomic Sequence: 2520 - 7 = 360 - 5 = 72 - 3 = 24 - 2 = 12 E D C B A By extrapolation of the Zodiac (#12) by the prime numbers in their natural order of appearance, we produce the sequence of discrete quantities that are the mini mal sums to accommodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. This presents the maximum data in a graphic context with minimum elements of informational referencia. Each subsequent Holotome retains all of the data of its father plus one added degree of data content, retaining coherency of the interrelationships existi ng in and between the members of the primary series. This natural system of coherent number behavior/structure was know to those who programmed the infrastructure of the Sumerian culture 6000+ years ago. The most direct association of the work of Zecharia Sitchin and the Auric Key is his notation (translated from cuneiform) of the Sumerian knowledge of the exact duration of the precession of the equinoxes as only recently confirmed by state-of - the-art astronomical tooling.

These two disciplines, quantitative notation and qualitative notation are in essence two sides of the same coin. The first Pythagorean rectangle, 3 measures by 4 measures, produces a hypotenus (diagonal) of 5 measures which affirms a synchronicity of the quantities 3, 4, and 5 with the quality of rectangularity, whic h in effect produces a synchronetic unity of number and geometry. 3 + 4 + 5 produces the quantity of twelveness, which is so fundamamental in Syndex Theory, as Holotome A. There are many ways to describe the synchronetic quality of a circle divided into 12 thirty degree sectors. For the purpose at hand, we prefer to draw attention to a square divided into a grid of sixteen subsquares which when enclosing a circle of 12 thirty degree sectors shows the grid lines intersecting the circle at exactly thirty degree intervals. Sequence of Discovery The semi-arbitrary answer to the question of why some unknown and ancient geometer selected 360 degrees for equating a circle has been that 360 has mor e than the usual amount of divisors for its size. This is far from a complete, speci fic, and logical answer. As a matter of fact 360 is divisible by all base digits except prime number se ven and when we multiply 360 by prime number seven, we produce 2520 which is the first and lowest number divisible by all base digits. This odd result might make us stop and think: Since by multiplying 2520 by the next prime we receive another palindrome followed by a zero, i.e. 27720, we naturally decide to destrapolate this sequence to see where it begins: 27720 - 11 = 2520 - 7 =360 - 5 = 72 - 3 = 24 - 2 = 12 Since these are the exactly most often cited numbers of ancient metrology, w e have arguably discovered the long lost key to the basis of ancient metrology or numeronomy. To amplify this claim, we have only to note that 12, 24, 72, 360, 2520, 27720, etc. are the exact sequence of minimal sums that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive divisors (factors of division). Because to my knowledge, no one else has discovered the complete and rational answer to the selection of 360 degree circular unity, I claimed the right to entitle this the Holotomic Sequence. In the Holotomes and Holotomic Sequence we see that the more-than-the-sum-of- its- parts quality of natural numbers emerges. They reveal the higher complex ity integrity of the newly emerging system.

In synergetics, the components and aspects of synergy do not work separately, but function together as a single systemic event: The Auric Key. Thus, the Auric Key functions as quasi-intelligence informing ration al number; this holonomic instruction gives any system its inherent in telligence to find its place and function in continued self-organization of its evol ution. Shortly after this revolutionary observation, I realized that #6 is exactly ha lf of the first true Holotome. This makes the first perfect number the nave of Holotome A (i.e. 12). The complete role of geometry and numbers in our grasp of reality and nature has been for centuries only partially acknowledged. A comprehensive system that coherently reveals the transdisciplinary relationships between music, ancie nt pyramids, esoteric numerology, astronomy, chemistry, physics, and architect ure has until recently remained virtually ignored. Marshall's vision provides the basis for a common vision: a key that unlocks conceptual doors and enables us to regain the vantage point our ancient ancestors presumably once possessed. The Structure of Number The Auric Key excavates many vital properties of numbers. The frequency of synchronicity is any whole number factor and factors of divisibility within t he limiting range determined by the base digits. One (1 = singularity) is regar ded as a special case. Number One is an indivisible integrity. Singularity is operationally irreve rsible. Number Two is an affinity-evolvable informational duality; self-generate d reciprocity. In our investigation of the creation of matter during the birth of the Universe, we have begun at singularity. While at singularity, the point of integrity has no physical dimension, it has metaphysical dimension and content of potentiality. In other words, we can consider potentiality as the content of integrity-singularity in the metaphysical dimension once-re moved from physical reality. The number field is holonomic, containing all things, encoded in the simplest and purest metaphysical pattern of informational potentiality. Numbers are a projection of evolving, expanding potentiality. We can go backwards toward the point of integrity/singularity into the evolution of its potentiality, which has no physical properties, but which is a seed potential. This is relatively eas y to illustrate with tetrahedronal geometry."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Singularity is irreversible. The sign, [ insert symbol] , represents a reflectional transaction, or the reversing of a function that passes through the infinitesimal , yet omnipervasive site between every numerically relative symbolic event. In the empirical sense, it means the inversion or reversal of the image; that transa ction which occurs to images reflected from a mirror or the surface of a dark pool of still water. In respect to the behavior of numbers, we know that reversal is a basic element to any system employing zero as a null state between plus and minus, for plus and minus are essentially the opposite or reversal of each other. , then, is the zero with an extra quality decreed by Syndex routine. That quality is the direction of positive quantitude. For even though zero is void of quantity itself, it still contains which way the quantity/unquality is relayed throug h its situation. That is, where zero is merely a location, is a situation for it incor porates direction. Thus, as a mathematical entity, (incorporates and) involves aspects of number structure that are otherwise not considered by the classical definition of the z ero expression. Our usual regard for one (1) as a number also creates a logical omission. This is likewise considered in the use of the Syndex character . Two (2), then, is the minimum element of reflectivity for each side (site); it is the essential twin as it can be divided and multiplied by itself, whereas one (1) cannot. Example: 2 x 2 = 4 1 x 1 = 1 Meaning plus two (2) is the first full positive, divisible and multiplicable unit and minus two (2), its reverse mate. In view of the foregoing considerations, we must allow that singularity is not reversible and polarity (2) is the minimum experience of numericity. Thus, frequency is the amount of base digits that evenly divide any given number, (1 excluded). Synchronicity is the specific combination (array) of base digits that dictate the frequency. The higher the frequency, the greater the universality of the number. The term \"fold\" indicates the specif ic incidence of divisibility. On the right hand side of the composite graph is a coded strip that shows visually the frequency of synchronicity of numbers 2 through 144. To the right of the number column are the eight color-coded tracks isolating the synchronicity of these numbers. For example, the number 72 is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. It thus has a six-fold frequency of synchronicity and has six white space s to"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"its right in the corresponding number tracks, which start at the base of the coded grid. Note that since every other number is evenly divisible by 2, there is a white spac e in every other position in the 2 (red) track. The same principle applies to subsequent tracks; there is a white space every third position in the three (orange) track, etc. The term \"null frequency\" is used in conjunction with the incomplete concept of a prime number. The colors chosen to represent the right frequencies are of two kinds: chromatic and metallic. The first six refer to the natural chromatic spectrum, while t he seventh and eighth refer to the metallic colors of silver and gold. One, (singularity, not an operational number at all), is white and has no set frequency since it is a special case. It can, in fact, be said to occupy all positions. To the immediate left of each number on the column is a corresponding horizontal tag that is coded to show the frequency of that particular number. The frequency of numbers is regarded essentially as their degree of primeness and...\"non- primeness.\" A null-frequency number, 23 is designated with a black bar to its left (11, 13, 23, 97, 121, 137) and generally those numbers classically referred to as prime. Notice that 121 is not prime, as such, being divisible by 11. There is a crucial distinction between the null frequency and the prime, one of conceptual essence. By standard definition, a prime number is divisible evenly by itself and one only. On the other hand, a null frequency number is divisible evenly by itself, one, and a limited set of primes that exceed the range of the base dig its. To the left of the strip is a series of horizontal bars whose color and length correspond to the frequency of a given number. A mono-frequency number is designated with a red bar to its left, a two-fold orange, three-fold yellow, four green, five blue, six violet, seven silver, and eight gold. All of the primes collectively constitute a subset of null frequency numbers, where the set of \"nul ls\" is determined by the base. The higher the base, the closer the set of nulls is to becoming identical with the set of primes, though they never totally coincide. In this context, the Auric Key shows the spectral relationship between high and low frequency numbers, and between null frequency and prime numbers. This eliminates a deeply rooted \"either /or \" dichotomy prevalent in the current notion of prime numbers, and basic assumptions regarding (or disregarding) the structure of number. The first number that is evenly divisible by all nine base digits is 2520. This is the auric (golden) node (knot) that ties ancient wisdom with modern data. The pyramids, standing stones of Stonehenge and calendars of the Mayan and Egyptian civilizations are with us no less than our personal computers and atomic clocks. 2520 is exactly twice the number 1260, a number referred to cabalistically five times in the Book of Revelations (12:6 and 12:4). It is half of the number 5040,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"which figures prominently in Plato's \"Laws\" regarding the architectural implications of his ideal city-state (and/or Atlantis). These and other key sacred numbers (identified with intervals along the coded strip) reveal the unifying elements of the major religions. They frequently recur throughout diverse sacred literature, music and architecture. Stonehenge is a very special example containing a comprehensive collection of these special numeri cal ratios in a supereconomic context. All convey similar information that relates words with numbers, and numbers with the operation of the cosmos. Another example of this is the Hebrew Qabala. The specially coveted numbers of each religion are crucial to the understanding of their esoteric teachings. They come from a time when guild secrets we re defended to the death. More important, however, is the perception of the matrix from which they derive, the OMNIT. If we spiral the nine tracks forming the coded strip, (extended to 2520), into seven bands of 360 places each, signficant patterns inherent in numeric structure are clearly revealed. This is the prime form and function of Synchrograph A (Holotome E, 2520), the prime reference key to the lost doctrines of the neolithic and pre-classical eras. The synchrograph A shows a split pentacle in the center. It is an extended translation of the coded strip in that each of the 360 places of each band (rotation) are designated with color where there would be voids in the coded strip. In spiraling the coded strip, both the coded number column and frequency codification were deleted. Notice that at the midpoint of 1260, the configuration of digital formation begins to reverse, or mirror itself until it is perfected at 2520, the last number of the seventh band, and the first omnit of the base ten system. This, in addition to 2520 being the exact product of 360 and 7, strongly indicates that the selection of 360 by ancient geometers and metrologists as a basic circular system of reference was neither arbitrary nor the result of bad astronomy, as some have suggested. The nine tracks, which the numbers make as they spiral outward in the synchrograph, form a pattern that visibly divides itself into twelve sections (termed synchrostats) of 210 numbers each (indicative of the criteria of 12 zodiacal signs). Common to the synchrostats is that they alone are divisible by 5, 6, and 7 (see chart regarding these) and these numbers are at the core of the twelveness that informed the ancient world of law, religion, commerce, etc. When Fuller saw the hexagonal court at Baalbek, he remarked that the ancient Phoenicians had recognized his principles of tetrahedral synergetics.

(insert THE CHEMISTRY PAGE). Many common spacetime measurements (Metrology) that people take for gr anted, such as the division of space into miles, feet and inches, and time into hours, minutes and seconds, derive from unknown antiquity. Yet these unite into place within the seven-banded spiral, creating a symmetrical and satisfying s ense of harmony. To elucidate, when the second band ending number is added to 144, 864 is derived. Odd, indeed, that there are 86,400 seconds in a day and that the current astronomical measurment of the sun's diameter is 864,000 miles! 2160, the sixth band ending number, has long been taken to denote an \"age of years,\" i.e. the Age of Aquarius, Pisces, etc., and is likewise close measurement of the moon's diameter in miles. Thus, space and time become equilibrated in a most mysterious, yet pleasing, fashion. The Auric Key reveals discrete levels of finitude, a series of holistic, ci rcular unities within the number field. Infinity, an often misunderstood word, cannot be classified. Lord Bertrand Russel pointed out the great paradox of analytical systems when he said: \"That class which includes all classes cannot be considered a class inasmuch as it is the only member.\" As a compliment alternative to infinity, the Auric Key points to the omnisynchronistic module, a crucial concept dealing with the expansive limitations of any finite quantitative system. It can briefly be defined a s the number that accomodates (synchronizes) the maximum amount of consecutive numbers from one onward possible. It is thus the most universal number of all (a common denominator to all real numbers). There are larger numbers, but none with as high a factor of divisibility. So, to repeat, the Auric Key shows relationships of finite, discrete levels of relationship as they are signified by numbers. Synergetics prefers the max imum information containment with the greatest economy of terms, and the Auric Key fills this requirement. The Study of Synchrographics Synchrographics emerged from the notion that geometry and numbers are interwoven disciplines emerging from a mysterious but unified source. By isolating basic relations between number and geometry something may be le arned about that source. Holotome E (2520) may be considered the cornerstone to the various mandalogs that comprise the Auric Key and reveals the pattern of compound"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"synchronicities that occur in behavior of the base digits in all their permutations, which end at 2520. It begins near the center and spirals outwards, a process which reveals even more inherent symmetry and produces tantalizing rays. There are seven spiral bands, each divided into 360 subsections. The conceptual discipline of synchrographics is both simple and complex. The many levels of graphing the relationships that exist between interdepende nt events and functions are possible. A simple biaxial grid consisting of vertical and horizontal rows qualifies as a synchrograph of the initial order. Gregor Johann Mendel is noted as employing this graphic technique, extensively in his botanical investigations concerning hereditary transmission, which actually layed the groundwork for the modern scientific theory of heredity. This work formed the first step to the DNA log istic. What might be called the second order of synchrographics consists of a TRIAXIAL GRID or radial/axial configuration of three axes of interreference. This mode consists of a finite 360 degree radial quan tum (Circular Unity). We cover it fully in PART FOUR as its own chapter. Here it is enough to say that it is a finite axial extension that represents an ambidirectional continuum of reference. It is a tridirectional continuum in the form of an ambidirectional or counter-spiral that formulates the triaxial we b of interdependent geometry of data which is otherwise referred to as the sunflower matrix, which encodes 618034. ( insert GRAPHIC OF SUNFLOWER) By the simple addition of spiralic axes all of which share a whole number comensurate synchronicity, we explicate the full band continuum of synchrographics, in two dimensions. The present investigations (of Neil Sloane at Bell Labs) that deal with the ideal distribution of points on the surface of a sphere is an intuitively misguided idea. His idea of multiplexing axes of interreference with the intention of creati ng additional axes of rational interaction only serves to protect intelligence by antiquated Euclidean absurdities based purely on Greek mythography. A serious review of SYNERGETICS II shows that Fuller clearly discredi ts the idea of perfection of the sphere. Fuller has clearly demonstrated through various expressions of geodesic rationality that Nature does not provide us with even one example of a perfect sphere. The only exception is the idea of a perfect circ le or sphere suggested by Plato. Let us examine the seemingly perfect glassine soap bubble in terms of the surfa ce \"skin\" on a coloidal level. Since triangular deployment of coloids cannot closepack on a curved surface only on a surface that is flat, our perfect bubble will by nature of space be a geodesic deployment of hexagons and pentagons ."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"In view of this, and Fuller's \"twelve universal degrees of freedom\" (wh ich determine the perfect interaction of triangle-square interface of t he dodecahedron and Vector Equilibrium Matrix.) we are forced by the laws of number/geometry to disregard ideal sphericity on any cosmic level other than imagination. So quasi-sphericity is what we and nature have to deal with. Since we can deal with that in terms of quantitative notation, which does not and will not lie, we have what is required of super science. Some might contend that such science is a religion. THE AURIC KEY (A Poemgraph on the Nature of Number) All SYNDEX mandalogs (or number wheels) are instrumental in the description of a system of number regard that is here termed Numeronomy. Links in ancient texts, sacred geometry, architecture, and the use of precessional “divine” number s indicate that the use of such a system may have been known in ancient times, perhaps even before the dawn of written history in Sumeria. After all, mankind had already been surveying the heavens for some 50,000 years. Syndex reveals the nature of number, which nature reveals so beautifully in the synergetic structure of the natural world, which is based on the tetrahedron as the minimal structural form in nature and the Universe. The primary tool of inquiry into this system is the synchrograph or mandalog. Mandalogs are composed of the graphic enspiralment of numbers about circles divided into differing axial allotments. A few discrete examples of the synchrograph have been selected as the most prolific in exhibiting special data arrays displaying the geometrical nature of number. Primary among these number wheels are the spiral of 2520 , known as the Auric Key; and the spiral wheel of 108, the Hindu number of the universe, the number of Om and the numerical basis of the Yugas and Ages. Scientific process depends upon numbers as legitimate tools regardless of what is recognized about their nature. Synchrographics emerged from the notion that geometry and number are separate yet interwoven disciplines emerging from an essentially unified source. B y isolating basic relations between them something may be learned about the nat ure of the source. Fuller discovered that, in synergetics, number is not an abstraction: each number has a geometrical identity as well as an inter-transformati ve numerical identity. This means that the number measurement of areas and volumes always comes out even, in whole rational numbers, without fractions or odd numbers left over. Attending synchrographics is a formal discipline resulting from the require ment to simplify an otherwise too complex model. The model employs a color code index"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"to redefine numbers graphically. Any given number has a “frequency of synchronicity” which is determined by how many of the base digits will evenly divide a given number. And this is color coded in the number wheels. Synchrograph A (#2520) consists of a nine-banded spiral that progresses seven times around a disc divided into 360 axial increments. Each of these nine bands are coded to shown the occurance of a base digit which is assigned a color in the place of the numerical figure itself. Thus, the first band, representing base digit two has a red space at every second position and the second band has an orange space at every third space, etc. Red 2 Orange 3 Yellow 4 Green 5 Blue 6 Iron/Violet 7 Copper 8 Silver 9 Gold Synch Once this color code is assimilated, one may easily refer to any number an d visually determine the frequency of synchronicity of the numbers by merely noting how many spaces are filled with a color.

Note that at 1260 (3 1/2 turns, or the auric nave ) all spaces are filled except the one (number 8) and at this location the sequence reverses and begins to mirror itself. (insert color graphic of 2520) Synchrograph B consists of enspiraling 108 labels around a circle divided into six axial stations. By regarding these labels as numbers, we find that the m ultiples of six always fall on the sixth spoke, but the multiples of five and seven fall into counter-rotational spirals that synchronize at 35, 70, and 105.

Or, if we regard the 108 labels as the chemical signs, we find that the inert gases alway lie in tri ne, as will the best electrical and thermal conductors, etc. In effect, this arrangement is symmetrically consistent in its graphic regard of chemical classifi cation. (insert color graphic of wheel 108) Synchrograph C consists of enspiraling numbers around a circle divided into 108 axial positions for 60 turns - or to number 6480, an ancient Hindu divine number derived from the Precession of the Equinox. This mandalog, like synchrograph B has two counterrotating spirals. A red spiral denoting multiples of 105 (multiples of 35) and a green spiral that denotes multiples of 111 (multiple of 37) and the engulfing number 108, is the third multiple of number 36. It has been found that the red spiral and green spiral will not meet at the engulfing axis until number 279720 is reached. This number is the key to the hypersynchronetic series. 279720 - 105 = 2664 108 = 2590 111 = 2520 Auric Node 279720 - 35 = 7992 36 = 7770 37 = 7560 279720 - 5 = 55944 6 = 46620 7 = 39960 Synchrograph D is a combination mandalog and synchrograph. Its configuration is result of comparing and analyzing the Stonehenge ground plan with the proven results of the synchrograph’s mechanism. Thus synchrograph D is a radial array of 56, keyed to the 56 “Aubrey Holes” at Stonehenge. When numbers are enspiralled around 56 axial positions, we find that the synchrostats fall only in the perfect axial quadrants, or east, west, south and north. (Stonehenge groundplan, annotated) The Auric Key as an Outgrowth of Synchrographics As discovered by Robert Marshall, the Auric Key began as a modern day effort t o illustrate the unique symmetry of numbers themselves. The graphic \"rituals \" culminated in the synchrograph we now know as Holotome E (2520) . In this graph every second square of the inmost spiral is highlighted, as compared to every third in the next, and fourth in the next, and so on."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Viewing the spirals additively (from inside outwards), the formation begins at one and continues until a number is reached where an additional track synchronizes, producing a number of higher frequency than any previous one. For example, three tracks synchronize at #6, four tracks at 12, 5, and 24, and six tracks synchronize at 72. Close inspection of these positions, called synchrostats , show a reflective pattern that pivots at half the number being considered. These numbers already cited are, in fact called Holotomes. The only exception is the first, 6, which is the nave of the first Holotome (A). The next synchrograph (Holotome F: 27720) has an 11 band spiral divided into 2520 sections. The pattern then perfects at 27720, a binomially reflective number which is the next Holotome after 2520. This pattern could be despiralated and extended vertically, but in so doing it would stretch to more than thirty feet! This shows the usefulness and economy of Synchrographics, which condenses otherwise extensive patterns while having other obvious advantages over row and column configurations. As an alternate to infinity, the Auric Key points to the omni-synchronis tic module. It depicts a crucial concept dealing with the expansive limitati ons of any finite quantitative system. It can be briefly defined as the numbe r with the greatest amount of consecutive divisors from one onward and is the most \"universal\" number of all. The omni-synchrononistic module is a web of relationships that exist in the first 28 Holotomes. A compounding of the relationships that occur, for instance in Holotome E (which deals with the permutation possible with the eight base digits), is shown by the fact that 2520 is the smallest number divisible by all eig ht base digits. The number 2520 is a common denominator of several religio- mathematical systems. The following is a list of historically important n umbers prevalent in the Auric Key: 5040 - found in Plato's \"Laws\" describing the dimensions of his ideal city/state. 1260 - referred to five times in the Book of Revelations and prevalent in ancient music theory. 360 - the number of degrees in a circle; 360 x 7 = 2520 60 - basis of the Babylonian number system; is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 12 - the twelve signs of the Zodiac, months in the years, hours on the clockface, etc. The Auric Key unites these seemingly disparate entities under a single gr aphic theory. In a letter to Robert Marshall, Buckminster Fuller comments on Plato's use of the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"number 2520: \"Plato does not say why he is concerned with the number 2520, but it is easy to discover as the product of the conventional 360 degrees of a circle being multiplied by the prime number seven, the circle's 360 degrees having inclu ded the first three primes to wit, two, three, and five, wherefore omission of the seven in the inherenly octaved Pythagorean physical demonstrations of mus ical note progressing of tensed strings rendered inherently all irrational. The cyclic calculating referenced to the Babylonianaly adopted 360 degrees as the comprehensive quotient of nature's cyclic behaviors...\" Also prevalent in the Auric Key is the number 56. The architecture of Stonehenge is based on a circle divided into 56 sections. 56 x 45 = 2520, and 45 and 56 appear in the exact middle of a list of the factors of 2520 (Holotome E). Could it be that those unknown architects who built Stonehenge used 56 as a practical reduction from an ideal circle of 2520 subsections? The relationsh ip between the Auric Key and Stonehenge does not appear to be coincidental . That Stonehenge probably served as a gauge of celestial phenomenon is well known. But is there yet another element pertaining to this megalithic structure ? Because of its ruined state, it is difficult to know what the exact dimensions of Stonehenge were when it was built. As a result, different theories have arisen as to its possible uses. The discrepancies in its dimensions allow for varying interpretations. Questions arise as to just how precise a celestial gauge Stonehenge was. I ts configuration has an elegance which rules out its inadvertent construction. In light of Synchrographics, Marshall has propounded a basic theory which states essentially that Stonehenge was a device for optimally expressing seve ral mathematical relationships, as such. The distinct possibility exists that the Stonehenge architects purposely sac rificed a certain degree of accuracy in describing specific phenomena, in order to accomodate the expression of several unique phenomena and relationships. Were this the case, and there is supporting evidence, then the Stonehenge architects were concerned as is Synchrographics, with the optimum expression of information within a given confine. The geometry of Stonehenge consists of whole numbers. The description of nature and the cosmos in terms of whole numbers was a concern not only of the Stonehenge builders and Pythagoras and his followers. Syndex has rediscovered a comprehensive system which shows numbers as they truly appear in nature, apart from our useful but somewhat arbitrary mathematical practices. SYNERGETICS, the revolutionary system of mathematics, formulated by the l ate Buckminster Fuller, emerges directly from the geometry and numbers emplo yed by nature. Fuller contends that nature uses only whole rational numbers, and his"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"geodesic modelling never requires resorting to irrational, unresolvable sum s, such as pi. Synergetics deals only with experientially demonstrable phenomena. \"Synergetics uses simple geometrical models based on a few basic modules that fit together in the most logical possible ways. Synergetics uses whole num bers, completely eliminating all irrational, imaginary, and irresolvable numbers and complex formulae...Synergetics, alone among general systems theories, models Universe using only frequency and angle.\" After Marshall's conception of Synchrographics, certain interesting cor relations arose between these two disciplines. One common feature of both systems is the definition of large multi-divisible numbers. These include the super-Scheherazade number of Synergetics and the omni-synchronistic module of Synchrographics. In reference to numerical structure, and particularly to the super-Schehe razade number, Fuller states: \"There is a basic wave running through the second powering of all number up to 50 and returning to zero. The wave series is 24 integers long. I'm confident that the circle consisting of the 71 integer number 616,494,535,0,868,49,2,48,0,51,88,27,49,49,00,6996,185,494,27,898,13,35,17,0,2 5,22,73,66,0, 864,000,000 is the number employed by universe as the comprehensive circular unity by virtue of which all interoperation of all numbers will always come out in whole rational results.\" Elsewhere ( Cosmography , 1992), Fuller tells us that this number can be used as the number of divisions of circular unity. \"This number embraces a minimum n number of all the prime number s involved in evolving all trigonometric functions and all the surface and volumetric spherical system intertransformings of synergetics.\" Multiplying the fourth, fifth, and sixth prime numbers-- 7, 11, 13, which superstition labelled \"bad-luck\" numbers--produces the 1001 Nights. As Dr. Fuller suggests, the occurrence of a basic wave is significant. It show s that despite their discrete nature numbers-as-integers have wave-like propert ies. Not only is there a basic wave running through the second powering of numbers, but there is an abundance of waves occurring on all levels of numbers. The super- Scheherazade number in it's finite aspect shares identical proper ties with the Holotomes previously described. What they share precisely is that both represent discrete levels of finitude."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"As previously stated, Bertrand Russell spoke of the paradox of referring to infinity: \"That class which includes all classes cannot be considered a class inasmuch as it is the only member.\" The omni-synchronistic module helps resolve this deeply embedded paradox. It allows us to graphically, and directly perceive the number behavior of the universe. As Dr. Fuller continues in a letter to Marshall, \"Nature is always operating in her own modular system of four progressively additive then progressively subtractive event octaves, with a ninth null event altogether constitu ting an octave nine system, all of which relate physically to two, four-vertexed ea ch tetrahedra, as the tuned in tuned out, minimal structural experience of universe.\" To understand this more thoroughly, bear in mind that the tetrahedron is a solid made up of four equilateral triangle faces. It contains the least amount of volume per unit of surface area and is considered by Fuller to be the basic building block of universe. The Auric Key excavates many vital properties of numbers. It's very exi stence and ultimate form hinges on numbers which occupy space. By arranging numbers in synchrographs, a number matrix or field is formed. Regarding numbers in terms of matrices and fields is important, and acknowledging that numbers have spatial qualities is vital to fully appreciate their significance. Each track in a synchrograph depicts the occurrence of certain events, i.e. the dividing of any given number by specific base digits. These events are not causally related to each other; the repetitious patterns of each track occur independently of each other. Nonetheless, important relations between them occur. Synchronicity as herein described stems from a numerical context. However, it closely parallels synchronicity as first propounded by the late Dr. Carl Jung, an acausal connecting principle. Jung sought to account for people's collective behavior and perceptions which could neither be explained by causation or purposivism. Causation explains behaviors as caused by past events, while purposivism explains behavior as determined by seeking future goals. To these Jung added a third principle called synchronicty for explaining those events which occcur together in time, but do not cause each other. They are events which are nonetheless related. Jung realized the physical significance of synchronicity and concurrently renowned physicist Wolfgang Pauli was developing comparable ideas in his theories. In the mid fifties, they collabora ted in an effort to describe their mutual concept of synchronicity."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"In light of their results, and in light of the specific nature of synchronicity we describe, it appears that the Auric Key constitutes a precise mathematica l model of synchronicity, as described by Jung and Pauli. Their work together centered around finding a unified view of psyche and matter. A desirable feature of synchrographics in general is that their very configura tion allows one to cognize several different patterns and relationships concurrently if not simultaneously. This is conducive to a far greater understanding of numbers and their over-all implications. By spiraling the periodic table into differing axes forming synchrographs, specific relationships between the various elements are accentuated. For example, the inert gases will lie only in trine or opposition to each other. This has precedent in modern chemistry and shows another application of synchrographics. Prime numbers play a vital role in the construction of geometric forms, and in turn of structures. These structures range from the microscopic to the macroscopic. They comprise our physical reality. In classical mathem atics, the order of prime number occurrance is submerged by the orderly progression of cyclical nine and predictable squares. Here again is the classical example of how context determines coherency . The way we have been looking at numbers has scrambled our vision of how they ultimately behave. In the graphic rituals of syndex numeronomy, the order of prime number distribution is for the first time described in an intelligent manner. The frequency of numbers is essentially their degree of \"primeness\" or \"no n- primeness\" with respect to the base numbers. The true set of primes is a subse t of the \"nulls\" where the set of nulls is determined by the amount of columns under consideration (base numbers). In this context, the frequency graph shows the spectral relationship between high and low frequency numbers such as 2520 and 26 respectively. This extends beyond a deeply rooted \"either/or\" dichotomy prevalent in the current notions of number and basic assumptions regarding (or disregarding) the structure of number. The myriad implicite patterns in the synchrographic rituals are staggering . Chief among them is the perfectly symmetrical arrangement of marked squares whi ch occurs regardless of how many columns are considered. Halfway between zer o and every holotome is a mirror; a location where every marked position on one side is replicated on the other, only reversed; an exact reflection. For example, Holotome A is evenly divisible by the base digits 2, 3, 4, and 6. Notice how this elegantly simple pattern progresses to the mid-point (or nave) at 6, and is perfected at 12. This general pattern recurs throughout all of the true holotomes, which are all divisible by 12."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"In fact, Holotome E, PART TWO: HOLOTOMES & THE HOLOTOMIC SEQUENCE Syndex Number Theory Holotomes A, B, C, D, E Definition of Mathematics with Description of Holotomic Sequence SYNDEX NUMBER THEORY A.

Since an enfoldment occurs at the end of the base digits when numbers start to be empowered by the occurrence of the second digit (ten), we are inclined to enspira l number about a circle of ten radial increments, but this strategy does not work. We are left with a radial array that is void of any significant patter : 10 - 20 -30 - 40 - etc. This uneventful cyclation of numbers produces nothing remotrely suggestive of a \"base wave\" that would manifest a synchronicity between number of a mutual"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"class such as primes or square numbers which, when played out in a linear sequence show no interactive relationship of any significance. The same goes for the enspiralment of nine except that when we look at the axis representing 9, we note that numbers reverse between 45 and 54 and go backwards. Until 81 is reached that is the reverse of 18 the first multiple of 9. This is a solid clue and one that leads to the first and genuine synchrograph, or a graph that synchronizes the fundamental classes of number in a highly meaningful context. When we use the 12-fold clock face or zodiac forms, we are overwhelmed with a series of synchronicities that deal with primes, composites and squares. First we discover that the primes fall in only four of the 12 possible axial locations: it means that eight axes are prime free. We've taken our first s tep to numeracy, the scientific discipline that we call synchrographics. This, in tur n, legitimizes the term numeronomy as a genuine scientific discipline in that i t has produced a systematic quality. The synchronicity of quality and quantity (number and form) is the gist of numeronomy, which is the proliferation of the Holotomes, or symmetrical cicular unities which are also the series of minimal sums which accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. The sequence of all sequences is the series of circular unities that are ge nerated by doubling twelve, then by multiplying the sun by three, and then by multiplying each resultant sum by the next prime as the primes occur in their natural order: [Insert:THE NUTSHELL DOCUMENT] This sequence, aptly designated as the Holotomic Sequence, represents the minimal plural quantities that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors.

In that one , singularity is not a number, Holotome E is regarded as the Auric Node. Thi s is, in every sense of the term, a full octave, and totally synchronetic with the NINELEVEN RETROGRADE OCTAVE, which also being of an exemplary nature, synchronizes via 4 forward and 4 reverse event octaves with a 9th null event. Definition of Mathematics with Description of the H olotomic Sequence Ordinary number, the psychological mechanism which we commonly refer to as the base ten concept of qualitative notation, is the ultimate foundation of science and technology. In order to state this proposition in the proper perspective, we must understand that number and geometry are two interdependent aspects of a singular mechanism and that the four fundamental operations of arithmetic are also an intrinsic component of these interactive disciplines. They cannot possess an independent existence of their own without the presence of each other in a totally unified context. This is to suggest that base ten number, which also involves the zero, geometry and the fundamental operations of arithmetic are a structural complex of interactive functions. Taken all together, they are a premathematical comp ound multiplex. Through the interactive mechanisms of their interdependent composition, they permit those secondary operations that we refer to as mathematics. The extensive realm of mathematical disciplines cannot occur without the complete aforementioned complex of synchronetic functions that operate as a holistic system of geonumerical mechanisms. It is precisely through this descriptive syntax that we draw the line between the tools we call number/geometry/arithmatic and the secondary operations we refer to as mathematics."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The common definition of arithmatic calls for four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A more exact regard tells us that only two fundamental operations exist, since addition is reverse subtraction, and no multiplication can occur without division. This perspective reduces the actual complexity of the componentry of the basic numerical and mathematical tools. We note that a triangle is a qualitative expression of the quantitative number THREE, and likewise a square is a qualitative example of the quantitative number FOUR. Number and geometry are two aspects of the very same physiomathematical function. One cannot exist independent of the other. In practice, however, in the discipline of mathematical operations, these distinctions merge in such a way that the line between the geonumerical tools and the mathematical products of those tools become merged in such a manner that number, geometry, and mathematics appear to be inextricably united in a common field of inseparable fusion. With such a perspective, it is nearly impossible to analyze their actual interrelations. For the sake of a dialectical analysis, we will suppose that number and geometr y, the two ambidirectional operations of arithmatic, are premathematical. All of the varied operations of mathematics are the secondary products of the geonumerical operations of arithmatic. In consideration of the foregoing suggestions, we have engendered a syntactical format. We have a clearly finite array of terminological componentry of physiomathematical epistomography. It successfully avoids the unspoken levels of distinction that confuse the dichotomy of quality and quantity that emerge in the discriptions of all mathematical definitions. They involve the separation of number, geometry, and the operations of mathematics. The primary confusion that occurs in the synchronization of number and geometry is due to the fact that the first three signs for plurality (one, two, and three) do not represent spatial geometry at all. It is not until we reach number four that spatial geometry becomes involved in the form of a tetrahedron, as the ideal example. In the first place, one is not even a number in the sense of the other eigh t digits. One is not unity, having no componentry to unite -- it must be deem ed as singularity. Number two may, at best, represent a line which cannot involve volumetric space. Three, on the other hand, may only represent a plane, its ideal form being a triangle."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Four, then, is the first of the base digits that can represent spatial geo metry with the ideal form being a tetrahedron. This means that only six of the base digits can deal with spatial geometry: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. They are points of reference in geometrical space. SIX is the first perfect number in that one plus two plus three rep resents the harmonious interaction of the first three number signs. Six also represe nts the three ambidirectional axes of the TRI which denotes the six direc tions of spatial geometry. It is through this logic that we begin the true synchroncity of number and geometry. The T.R.I. is the cornerstone of real numbers that formulate the geonumerical series of spatial forms that produce an exemplary series of geometric al forms that synchronize numerical values with geometrical forms that involve numericall y synchronous spatial integrity. The Holotomic Sequence begins with the dodecahedron or twelve spheres that surround a 13th nuclear sphere, producing the first quasi-spheroid of six square windows and eight triangle windows. The Holotomic Sequence begins by doubling the first perfect number a nd then multiplying each resultant sum by the series of prime numbers as they naturally occur. 1 x 2 x 3 = 6 A x 2 = 12 B x 2 = 24 C x 3 = 72 D x 5 = 360 E x 7 = 2520 F x 11 = 27720 G x 13 = 360360 H x 17 = 6126120 In this way the minimal sums with the maxiumum amount of consecutive factors are produced. Each represents both a planar and cubic mode of a harmonious and symmetrical retrograde octave unity which synchronizes number and geometry i n a qualitative and quantitative geonumeric modual (dual module)."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"No other sequence can accomodate these aspects in an order of mathematical exactitude. The Holotomic Sequence represents the series of minimal numerical sums that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. The science of mathematics, the alphanumeric system of notation and industrial civilization, in general, has resulted from the metrological functions derived f rom this sequence. The transpalindromal function of the exemplary 99 retrograde octave wavecy cle accounts for the synch/desynch mechanism of the continuity of the baseten system of quantitative notion of which the discipline of geometry is an interdependent ambifunctional unification of number and form. To recap, spatial geometry does not play a role in number until the number four is involved. Three can only represent a surface or plane with the triangle as the minimal regular form. Number four may represent spatial volume in the form of a tetrahedron as its minimal regular form: 4 windows and 4 vertices. So, already we have a half positive and half negative octave situation: windows opposed to vertices. This means that only six of the basic numbers can involve spatial volumetric geometry. The next important number in spatial geometry is twelve. This occurs through the dodecahedron (an irregular solid by Platonic description), which evolves from the closepacking of 12 spheres about a 13th nucleus sphere. This produces six square windows and eight vertices. This also produces #14 as a geometrical factor (2 x 7). The dodecahedron, then, can represent a quasi-sphere. In constrast to the tetrahedron, (which is the most surface for the least volume), the step to the dodecahedron is a great volumetric increase. Ignoring the regular solids of Plato and considering the whole range of Fullerean geodesic configurations with a distribution of pentagons and hexagons we find a series of quasi-spheres, which become more spherelike as they grow in size/number. Still, they will never achieve perfect sphericity, in nature or t he abstract. When we consider this sequence of geodesic spheroids, (or quasi spheres), we are struck by an analogy that occurs in number sequencing. The Fibonacci Series grows irrationally until the 17th member (6180339), then stabilizes for the first eight digits and continues on. It is at that point where, whe n represented as a spiral, it grows in size but does not change in shape."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Number sequences that are deficient shrink faster than they grow, reaching a sort of circularity while their counterpart proficient goes wild into an arch tha t approaches linearity, (but never quite attains it). The Holotomic Sequence is totally different than all the other sequenc es. It becomes somewhat erratic in its initial phase especially the firs t three members which are two digit: 12, 24, and 72. Then it grows one digit at a time until its 8th member: 6126120, which is seven numbers long, then it skips to a nine digit number, (omitting an 8 digit Holotome) From then on, the series is very slightly dificient and skips over an integer length eve ry so often.. The remarkable thing about the Holotomic Sequence is that the hard digits quit at fourteen positions and continue to build on with accumulative zerosity. That is, after 14 hard numbers, we get nothing but zeros. The Holotomic Sequence is more representative of geometrical space than planal geometry. Like the polygons - the 56 Aubrey Holes of Stonehenge give us a pi value of 3.111, repeating-- that means a polygon of 56 circumference is commensurate with a diameter of 18 of the same units. 3.11111108280 - 2520 = 0.123456789 We find an association here with Holotome E: 2520. Inasmuch as 45 x 56 = 2520, the 45 representing also a right angle (1/2 of 90 degrees) to 360 circular unity. At this point, the question to Neil J. Sloane is just what logic is there in finding the ideal distribution of points on the surface of a sphere, when (as Fuller assert s) there is no ideal sphere to be found in nature? Only quasi (geodesic) sphere, which can never reach a finite sphericity, even though they come close. Using pi , we never come up with an end to an irrational sequence, and nature simply doesn't operate this way. The geodesic is the modus operandi of nature herself, and by regarding the sequence of holotomes as a series of rational (finite) steps, we have a genuin e logical dialogue with nature. The Platonic solids were an attempt to find ideal forms, but some of these have never been found in nature, but only in the abstractions of the imaginations of mathematicians and geometers. The Fullerean geodesic quasi-spheres, on the other hand, are prominent in nature's scenarios and structural forms. Even viruses have recently been discovered, through high magnification, of geodesic design. Dodecahedral seed pods are also prevalent topological formations in biological stereotypes of nature. Even the apparent sphericity of soap bubbles is geodesic."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Fuller's geodesic modelling works on the atomic and molecular level. Extending these spherical models into chains is what led to the architecture of the D.N.A. spiral. Fuller presented a model of DNA with the chain of tetrahedrons that requires 22 to make a full revolution. Qabalist, Stan Tenen discovered a correspondence with the Hebrew alphabet with these 22 tetrahedrons (tetrahelix). Actually, it wa s the Akkadians who first used the 22 letter alphabet by adding Aleph to the Sumerian 21 letter alphabet (six of which were vowels). It is my opinion that the Akkadians were the first to corrupt a perfect alphabet of 21 letters--an alphabet capa ble of producing an ideal syntax. The infrastructure of such an ideal syntax can be seen in the proposition: THE SYNDEX PRETZEL 12 2 : 144 +108 = 9 x 12 12 x 21 = 252 palindrome +189 = 9 x 21 21 2 : 441 Transpalindromic composite roots producing transpalindromic compos ite squares.

This produces the series of minimal sums that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors. Having studied the nature of this sequence for the past 30 years, I am totally confident that the Sumerians were programmed by this system in order to produce the metrology that created not only the alphanumeric system of notation, but the whole mathematical foundation of industrial civilization or civilized culture it self."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The first regression of this perfect system was the Akkadians addition of Aleph.

Later, Sir Issaac Newton formulated the laws of motion, the most significa nt of which is the retrocity involved in action vs. reaction. This put us on the track to modern industrialization. His mind could not deal with the triangle, but he made the most of dualism. The return to valid numeronomy did not recur until 1980, when Marshall discovered the Holotomic Sequence through an innovative discipline termed Synchrographics. It was because I was not programmed by mainstream scholasticism that I had to disbelieve the fiction that prime numbers were an example of chaos. In my semi- literate way, I knew better and set about devloping a method of rediscovering the truth which is that geometry and number, quality and quantity are two sides of the same coin. But to find the key to their synchronicity, I had to realize that only six of the base digits could involve spatial geometry. That I have discovered a strange and wonderous aspect of the natural sequence of number there can be no doubt. And that these patterns of the continuum of number were responsible in extreme antiquity for formulating the basic metr ology that established and proliferated industrial culture is beyond dispute. The question that recurs in my mind with great regularity is this: Of what use is this knowledge or how can it be further employed in the realm of science in a world where metrology is as natural as our breathing and for the operations of technology just as essential, like correcting the ways that technology is m isused. The Holotomic Sequence is physically interrelated with these geometrical geodesic forms that look like perfect or ideal spheres.

R.B.F. is the first o f modern numeronomists to address this problem in a more appropriate way by pointing out that nature is operating in an octave nine system -- that is, an octave with a ninth null event. Echoing from the ancient past, we find the words of Zoroaster, \"The number 9 is sacred, and attains the summits of philosophy.\" The problem I am referring to comes about by regarding one as a number wherea s one represents singularity, which is not a number in the sense that 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and nine are numbers. Psychologically and symbolically speaking, one is not a number. In Ego and Archetype, (p.184), Edward Edinger informs us that, \"The number one as the first and original number is, strictly speaking not a number at all. One as unity and totality exists prior to the awareness of numbers which require a capacity to distinguish between separate discrete entities. Thus, one symbolically corresponds to the uroboros state prior to creation and the separation of things. Thus, two is the first real number...\" Since zero is also not a number, we are left with only eight genuine numbers. Therefore, in reality our number system is rightfully base eight, not bas e ten.

The dynamic or kinetic picture supercedes the implicate rigidity sugges ted by the term structure. To hyphenate behavior-structure in the attempt to rescue this semantic impass becomes a gesture of redundance serving only to confuse an issue already unclear. Since geometry and number are two aspects of the same series of interrelationships that begin with the quality of triangularity denoting the qua ntity of number three, we give birth to the idea of a synchrograph. We have"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"synchronized quantity and quality on an initial level. With this in mind, we may state that sequence is plural and at minimum threefold. Sequence is the key to the idea of behavior, and triangularity the key to the idea of structure. By the doublation or foldment of triangularity we produce (synthesize) both the quality we call hexagonity and the qualities inherent in the first perfect e xample of quantitude. With it, we give rise to the idea of harmony inasmuch as one plus two plus three equals six, i.e. the harmonious interaction of a unification of whole number components. By enclosing the hexagon within the perimeter of a circle, we give cre dibility to the concept of circular unity. This could be a far-reaching and important concept to industrial intellectuality despite its most mundane and simplistic nature. Circular unity is responsible for the synchronicity of more basic and therefor e crucial concepts than any other single idea. It is also the most disregarded conceptual idea entity of all. A comprehensive formula for physiomathematical epistemography begins wit h a clear notion of the synchronetic profile between the ideas of quantity and quality. This profile is founded upon the web of terms surrounding the notion of number six. Since circular unity in terms of quantity six is limited to a planar format, we must double this phase of plurality to deal with spatiality in a volumetric sense. This i s expressed in terms of a referential format properly termed the Triaxia l Retrograde Interface. By intersecting three ambidirectional lines of direction at a common loci, we produce the minimal spatial mapping of the six-sided cube, which may also designate the external parameters of a sphere which could be seen to enclos e that sphere within its six imaginary faces. The T.R.I. demonstrates the interreferential labeling of up/down, right/left , fore/aft. It lends itself to the metrological dimensions of any spatial confi guration as the minimal graphic system of spatial description in terms of quantitative and qualitative mechanisms, the most fundamental elements of descriptive language. Fuller's statement that unity is plural and at minimum sixfold can then be considered the fundamental key to the mechanism of linguistic description in terms of common empirical practice (irregardless of the language involved ). This semantic representation of sixfold unity as the minimal frame of ref erence is less elegant than the graphic depiction. The ideal form of syntax is crucial to a ny scenario of space-time formulation, the denial of which would lead to absurdity, paradox, and general descriptive error.

BASIS OF THE SYNDEX GLYPHS In the mid-sixties, I chanced on the notation, description, and general explanation of a glyph purported to be a \"null-A\" sign (not Aristotelian), which considered ideas beyond the traditional capacity of Grecian/Roman syntax. The very general and simple significance suggested by the writer who brought this sign to my attention, (it could have been Isaac Asimov?), implied that it refered to the idea that any function that passed through infinity reverses it self: . I eventually adopted this symbolized idea to act as a mechanism to synchronetically involve the 12 possible combinations (of palindromic, transpalindromic and all other possible classes of square, composite, and prime number permutations of trirelational retrocity). It presented itself a s an ideal context with which to amplify the coherency of the ideas concerned with the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"minimal amount of symbolic componentry. Whether this strategy of notational invention will survive the test of time, only time itself can judge. The simplistic statement that each level of finitude is the revers e of its prior is demonstrated through the observation that minimal unity is sixfold and by its essential linear or circular context demonstrates that we are always dealing with a specified quantity of discrete levels of finitude . Infinity as a notion of singularity is totally devoid of rational significanc e. By virtue of this notion--for the most part, intuitive--prominent experts in the field of mathematics concede the existence of a diversity of classes of \"infinity .\" In practice, physicists often correct equations to eliminate the absurdity o f infinity. \"Just because equations produce an infinity does not mean that an infinity exists in any practical sense. In fact, physicists quite often 'renormali ze' equations to get rid of infinities, so that they can ascribe physical meaning to their numbers. An example is the calculation of the electron's mass fro m theoretical principles, which at face value leads to an unrealistic, infini te mass. The same kind of mathematical sleight of hand might need to be done for vacuum energy calculations, \" according to Phillip Yam, SciAmer, Dec. 97, p82, \"Exploiting Zero Point Energy.\" To sum up the ideas involved in the foregoing preamble, I will simply assert that the term infinity is but one case of a plethora of totally meaningless terms. Only through the complex nature of syntax can any word conform to a definition generated through the absurd notion of \"dictionarity\" as having some sort of stati c meaning. The Classification of Number in General Like the stars, numbers cannot be counted but they can be properly classified and identified accordingly. There are twelve glyphs which comprize the full constellation of numb er classification. Palindromic prime; retroprime composite; transpalindromic com posite; retrocomposite square; palindromic square; retroprime square; transpalindromic prime; retrocomposite prime; palindromic comp osite; retrosquare composite; transpalindromic square; retrosquare pri me."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Of the countless numbers that seem to exist, at least to the human mind, there are but twelve classes that will identify any particular number that will ever come to your attention. The structural profile of the sequencial progression is characterized by t he interaction of these twelve discrete kinds of numbers. The omission of any one of these classes is enough to disrupt the continuity of the order which they represent . The fact that most of these classes have never been considered at all is rea son enough that prime number behavior has remained a mystery to modern number theorists. Out of the 90 two-digit numbers, there is but one square number that is a prime when turned around backwards. Such a number is rare, no matter how many digits compose it. This number is already recognized as special to modern electronic technology. However, no one else at the moment knows the real reason why this number is so special. The number in question is SIXTEEN. It is the sole 2-digit square that is a prime in reverse -- 61, its reverse, is a prime. According to the nomenclature of the syndex routines, number sixteen is designated as a retroprime square. The glyph that represents this class is . And, of course, the glyph that represents 61 is , its exact reversal. In order that one can follow the logic of these glyphs, it is not necessary to memorize all twelve, which cover the complete classification of all number. It is necessary, however, to have a fair grasp on the square numbers. Especially pay attention to the glyphs that represent the palindromic primes like 11 and 101. The glyph that represents their class is . It is by virtue of the transpalindromic nature of the numerical continuum that these classification markers are necessary. The complexity of the cont inuum can not be understood without them. It has become my confident opinion that the full system of number classification was acknowledged in prehistoric time. Of course, they didn't use the glyphs we are adopting, but that does not matter. Any sign that we wish to use can serve the function. Or any word, that we wish to use to represent the idea would yield the same result. The written letter, sign, number, or glyph is only a symbol of the word which, in turn, is only an audio symbol of the idea. It must be clearly understood that the only reason for writting and numbering on stone, clay, metal, paper, or electronics is for the purpose of storing and transmitting ideas across space and time. Otherwise, any information or data can be communicated between two minds with nothing more than articulated sounds or gestures.

In standard English, I have finally found something worthwhile to divulge to whoever wishes to understand things not generally known even to the inquisitive. The twelve glyphs that comprise the complete classification of number are an important part of my thinging language. The central catalytic element for this twelve sign alphabet of number is an inverted : . To me, this represents the universe of plurality, which in turn represents both the inside and outside, much like the Hebrew sign for Beth or house. It is merely an empty container, a c up upside down. When I draw a line through this cup: , it signifies a function that passes through. It goes in, then out. When I put an arrowhead on one side: , it means that the function has a specific direction. It is as simple as that. When applied to a number like 13, I write: .

Thus, by reviewing the continuum of number ambidirectionally, I have unlocked the enigma of why the palindromes occur where they do, which is the key to the mystery of prime number occurrence or distribution. For example, here we have a full octave of retrograde number profile, by taking a palindrome: 555 and subtracting 99, then adding 99 in precessive and successive steps. 159 + 99 258 99 357 99 456 99 555 99 654 99 753 99"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"852 99 951 Since there are only eight base digits that are comprized of componentry (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) you can never produce a transpalindromic sequence that goes further than eight positions--an octave.

Number graphs supplied with this text amplify the epochal significance of this crucial aspect of number behavior. Without this critical insight, the enigma of prime number deployment would remain a mystery. It seems as if number theorists have always regarded the reverse of numbe r only in terms of the minus or negative numbers, and not the reversal of the individual numbers themselves. That addition is reverse subtraction and multiplication only occurs through division is not generally recognized due to the idea that in the operations of arithmatic they occur in conjunction without conscious regard. Therefore, we say \"the four fundamental operations of arithmatic\" instead of the two ambidirectiona l operations. Retrocity is an easy thing to ignore, because it is something that must be ignored in order for the operations to function within the discipline. But, ignoring the whole reverse nature of the number continuum itself, permits the symmetry of number to be submerged in the non-symmetrical quasi-chaos of how and when prime numbers occur in relation to non-primes. Number symmetry requires another aspect which is that you must have a finite group of numbers in order to have symmetry. This is where circular unity comes into play in the form of the Holotomes. Each Holotome is a half positive, half negative (retrograde) circular unity, comprized of the minimal sums that accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors. As a special case, Holotome E, or 2520, which is the first sum to accomodate all eight base numbers. The midpoint (1260), goes into retrograde. It is divisible by all the bases except 8."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"We nurture the opinion that knowledge evolves and that things understood 2,000 years ago are not worth considering. The opposite is true, certain aspects of knowledge evolve due to this very attitude about modernity.

By the simple destrapolation of that Holotome via the primes in their reverse order that I rediscovered the Holotomic Sequence or Auric Key. And then I found the nave of twelve was number 6, or the first perfect number. Each of these sums when mapped out in the manner of Holotome E produce the same half positive, half negative, symmetrical retrograde unity. The next important breakthrough occured in 1981 when I discovered the four pairs of reversable, two-digit primes that clicked into a perfect symmet rical bridge that fit the octave occuring in the exemplary nineleven wave cycle. Their symmetry was made perfect by a fith pair of near-prime composites composed of the 1st pair: 13 31 17 71 37 73 39 93 79 97 11 13 17 31 37 39 3 x 13 71 73 79 93 3 x 31 97 99"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"This is much more evocative when viewed in conjunction with the fully notated column of the first 99 numbers which are rendered in a three column collation entitled the anatomy of the nineleven cycloflex: EXEMPLARY BASE WAVECYCLE. The synchronization of the Holotomes with the wavecycle is a matter somewhat difficult to describe even with the usual number constructions. The transpalindromic squares with their transpalindromic composite roots are the place to begin, especially since the first root number is the first Holotome, (A ). Any Holotome added to its own reversal produces one third, or two thirds of 99, exactly 99, or a high factorial multiple of 99. Holotome A: 12 + 21 = 33 : 1/3 of 99 B: 24 + 42 =66 : 2/3 of 99 C: 72 + 27 =99 : 3/3 of 99 The introduction of the zero produces an element of confusion in regards to how the reversal is presented in terms of where the zero is placed. D: 360 + 630 = 990 : 10 x 99 Inasmuch as 252 is a palindrome, the same element of confusion occurs in the place ment of the zero: E: 2520 +0252 2772 = 28 x 99 (28 is the second perfect number) F: 27720 = 280 x 99 G: 360360 = 3640 x 99 It may be said then that the Holotomes represent a discrete finite unity each i n themselves. They reserve a transfinite connection with the continuum of number through their synch/desynch relation with the exemplary 99 wavecycle through the elusive function of retrocity. My wording on this issue may leave much to be desired because the whole issue suggests a paradox. The term transfinite, if we consider it carefully, is a t erm that suggests a warrented paradox since going beyond the bounds of finitude is to be unfinite, but not necessarly infinite, which is a word I've not much use for. \" Discrete levels of finitude\" is a phrase I used in some notes many years ago, and I guess this will still serve to describe the Holotomes as they relate to the wavecycle, which is shown to be an unbroken sequence of cycloscillations. In full confidence this is the last comment I wish to make on the matter, until such time as I see things from some unexpected perspective."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" SUMMARY: IN THE SPIRIT OF ALADDIN'S WINDOW Fuller was the only person in recent time who came close to eradicating the theory of number with a totally rational, logical and comprehensive analysis of the behavior and/or structure of the so-called base ten system of quantitative notat ion. He formulated a most coherent definition of the familiar but misunderstood term, unity: #1: \"Unity is plural and at minimum twofold...\" #2: \"Unity is plural and at minimum sixfold...\" In the first instance, I interpret the twofold unity to merely mean the unifica tion of a pair of singularities. No geometrical involvement can occur in number two other than a line which might demarcate each from other. This line is the vector joing the centers of two spheres of equal radius. Since one is not a number but an instance of singularity, it may be said to represent a point (as a geometrical aspect). Number three is the quantitative expression of the quality of triangula rity; geometrically, it is the first instance of a plane. Number four is the first digit to represent geometrical space in th e four window or four vertices of the tetrahedron. Skipping five, for the moment, to his sixfold minimal plural unity, we can understand his statement of \"two four-vertexed each tetrahedra as th e minimum experience of universe. In this context we have a fully spatial, geometrical and harmonious unification of plural unity. One plus two plus three equals six. The so-called first perfect number is the harmonious whole number synchronetic u nity minimal in the spatial sense. Since the two four-vertexed each tetrahedra may be seen to have six windows but only five vertices, we have accomodated the five frequently \"skipped over\" non- symmetrical or harmonious unification of componentry. It is on the logic of Fuller's definition that I define circular unity as a s ymmetrical and harmonious interaction of both numerical and geometrical events. I signify this in the quantitative and qualitative geonumerical graphic entity designated as the TRIAXIAL RETROGRADE INTERFACE. The two dimensional representations of this T.R.I. space coordinate structure can be seen in the classic color wheel with three classes of duality."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The confusion of one with unity probably began with the geometry of the Greeks who totally ignored the age old and much reiterated question of whether or not to count Aleph. The very expression \"Number One\" is a self-contradiction since one is in essence a singularity. It has no componentry to unite. Since neither zero nor one are numbers in the same sense as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, the title baseten only refers to the amount of signs that make up the system, which only consists of eight true numbers, i.e. signs that represent a plurality of components. In one place, Bucky refers to number as \"an octave system with a 9th null event.\" I interpret this statement as the transposition of one still being regarded as a number, to nine as the null event. The German word for no (nien, null, nothing, nada) could have influenced this attitude, plus the fact that the cyclic lap in the retrograde octave occurs there: No transpalindromic series can exceed eight positions because only eight true numbers (or members) exist. The multiples of nine reverse between 45 and 54, or precisely at 49.5. Bucky wrongfully cited the \"turnaround\" at fifty, which is exactly one half off... The multiples of 99 turn around between 495 and 594 or, at precisely 544.5. The multiples of 1089 at 5445, a whole number nave or location of the retrograde second half octave. Thus the exemplary octave wavecycle occurs through the continuous interaction of nine and eleven: 9 x 11 = 99 99 x 11 = 1089 999 x 11 = 10989 9999 x 11 = 109989 99999 x 11 = 1099989 999999 x 11 = 10999989 octave (Editorial Note: As for the other sections, this one contains many unscanned number graphs including a 9-axis spiral to 108; mapping the 9/11 cycloflex; prime/square interface; comments on #41; Fibonnaci sequencing beginning with first two holotomes; list of retroprime squares; first five-digit palindr omic prime; nine repeating digits divided by the sum of those digits produces the nine base digits in their original sequential order; graphic comment on number/behavior structure; crab mantra; exemplary 9/11/ retrograde octave wavecycle ; continuity of 9/11 wavecycle; Biaxial Synch.

Traditionally, the rectilinear XYZ system of defining points in 3D space has be en used since ancient Greece. But what is a point? Since the birth of quantum mechanics the meaning of the supposed three- dimensionality of space has come into question. The best answer to what a point is in physical terms is the elementary atomic particle such as an elec tron. But on closer examination, it has no discernable physical structure and exhibits wave -like properties. Three coordinates are too few to describe the state of the electr on. However, Fuller reminds us that \"nature is not using the strictly imaginal, awkward and unrealistic coordinate system adopted by and taught by present-day academic science.\" Synergetic modelling is fundamentally different in its entire appr oach: \"The synergetic hierarchy provides a description of all omnitriangulated polyhedr al systems exclusively in terms of points and prime numbers.\" Fuller's critique of Euclidean geometry comes from it deficiency in mode lling holistic and energetic processes: \"T he XYZ coordinates of parallels and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"perpendiculars have nothing to do with the way the Universe is operating. Universe is operating in radiational-divergence and gravitational convergence. Events in parallel never get resolved; convergent events become exquisite ly resolved. You cannot have a nucleus in a perpendicular or a parallel system. You can have nuclei only when you have symmetrical tetrahedral convergence.\" He outlines the self-organization inherent in nature: \" Nature's continuous self- regeneration is 100 per cent efficient, neither gaining nor losing any energy. She grows outwardly by omnitriangulated structuring from nuclei.\" As a frame of reference, the cube or hypercube is inherently unstable. A vectorially-edged cube collapses without triangulation. Six end-interconnected diagonals form the six edges of a tetrahedron. The most efficiently stabil ized cubical form is accomplished with the prime structural system of Universe, t he tetrahedron. Squares and cubes may have been fine for dividing up fields after floods or carving stone. But they are not the best model for curvilinear reality. Without diagonal stabilization, a nonstructurally triangulated cube is a topological s elf- deception. XYZ as a frame of reference or orientation is obsolete. Fuller clued us in that, \"Synergetics is not a frame at all, but a pattern of most omnieconomical (ergo, spontaneous) interaccomodation of all observed self-and- otherness interexperiencing, (ergo, geodesic--geodesic being the most economical interrelationship of a plurality of events).\" He further states again that, \"All structures are tetrahedrally based.\" Six vectors provide minimum stability, therefore the synergetic model far exceeds the simple cube in defining a volumetric, energetic entity. The cube is still part of the intertransformations. It can contain or be contained by a sphere, and is part of the reciprocation of the vector equilibrium (cuboctahedron) with its geometric dual--the octahedron within a cube. Therefore, it is infinitely superior as a frame of reference, even though it is no frame at all, but an energetic system. CIRCULAR UNITY The full definition/description of circular unity begins first with the definition of the word unity. As defined by Fuller in Synergetics II: \" Unity is plural and at minimum sixfold.\" Drawing from a variety of Fuller's sources, we find that, \"A point is not a relationship...for every point in Universe, there are six uniquely and exclusively operating vectors...There are six vectors or none.\""},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"\"Every event is six-vectored. Six unique vectors constitute a tetrah edral event. Each vector is reversible, having its negative alternate. There are no strai ght lines, physical or metaphysical. There are only geodesic, i.e. most economical, interrelationships (vectors).\" \"It takes a minimum of six interweaving trajectories to isolate insideness from outsideness, ergo, to divide all Universe systematically into two parts-- macrocosm and microcosm...Unity, as represented by the internuclear vector modules, is of necessity always of the value of two; that is, unity is inherently two, for it represents union of a minimum of two energy centers.\" Imagine two ping pong balls kissing. Imagine a line connecting their centers (vector). Half of the vector forms the radius of one sphere, while the other half forms the radius of the other sphere. Unity is dualistic in this sense, of uniting two singularities. \"There may be no absolute division of energetic Universe into isolated or noncommunicable parts. There is no absolutely enclosed surface, and there is no absolute enclosed volume. Universe means 'toward one-ness' and implies a minimum of twoness....Our modern concept of Universe is a comprehensive system of energy processes. Universe is a non-simultaneous potential vector equilibrium...The vector equilibrium is the minimum operational model of happenings.\" Vector Equilibrium is a sublime state which energetic processes constantly pa ss through, but never stop at. It is where interference patterns can pass through one another in energetic changes, without interference. Vector Equilibrium is the common denominator of tetrahedron, octahed ron and cube. It is the prime nucleated system. It is omnidirectional equilibrium based on the closest packing of spheres of equal radius. The nuclei of atoms are based on this close packing. In this model, physical and metaphysical reality sha re the same ideal design. \"All experiences are omnidirectionally oriented. Omnidirectional experience s resolve themselves scientifically into discrete angle and frequency patterns. That is life! Relations are local to pattern. Patterns are comprehensive to relationships...In considering a total inventory of the relative abundance of different patterns, it becomes apparent that patterns are reciprocal. \" \"There are six positive and six negative degrees of fundamental transformation freedoms, which provide 12 alternative ways in which nature can behave most economically upon each and every energy-event occurrence. You have six vectors or none for every energy event ... For every event-fixed locus in Universe, there are six uniquely and exclusively operative vectors. Every vector is reversible. Every event is six-vectored. There are six vectors or none.\" In sections 537.10 and 537.14 of SYNERGETICS I, Fuller reiterates these basic truths:"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"\"Each of the six positive and six negative energy lines impinging on every nonpolarized point (\"focal event\") in Universe has a unique and symmetrical continuation beyond that point. The six positive and six negative vectors are symmetrically arrayed around the point. Consequently, all points in Universe are inherently center of a local and unique isotropic vector matrix domain containing 12 vertexes as the corresponding centers of 12 closest- packed spheres around a nuclear sphere.\" Hopefully, these reiterations of the geometry are helping the reader to visuali ze this system more clearly, and energetically. \"Experiments show that there are six positive and six negative degrees of fundamental transformation freedoms, which provide 12 alternate ways in which nature can behave most economically upon each and every energy-eve nt occurrence. Ergo, there is not just one \"other\"; there are always at least 12 \"others...We find that in the 12 degrees of freedom, the freedoms are all equal and they are all realizable with equal 'minimum effort'.\" \"The six vectors represent the fundamental six, and only six, degrees of freedom in Universe. Each of these six, however, has a positive and a negative direction, and we can therefore speak of a total of 12 degrees of freedom.\" In 2D, circular unity can be graphically demonstrated by a circle divided into s ix individual but interdependent sections. The color wheel is a good graphic example of circular unity, and represents six discrete qualities of six individual but interdependent quantities represented by each section of the wheel. A circle ca n be divided into six distinct quantities, each with individual but interdependent qualities, i.e. unification of number and geometry. In that six is the sum and/or product of the first three numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 or 1 x 2 x 3, it contains a harmonious whole number relationship with them, and is thus called the first \"perfect number\". The first instance of the harmonic synchronization of number and geometry (quantity and quality) occurs in the number six. However, this prescription for circular unity is two-dimensional. The three pair s are each separated by the centerpoint which has no dimension. In order to formulate a spatial abstraction of circular unity, we draw three lines that interconnect the six face centers of a cube and enclose that cube within a spher e. Doubling this two dimensional circular unity produces the first true Holotome (A), which is predicated on number twelve. This three dimensional holotome of six positive, and six negative symmetrical retrograde event identity axes is then also represented by the closepacking of twelve spheres about a thirteenth nucl eus sphere. This produces the dodecahedron, (the primitve non-pi spherical module). Synergetics modelling of space has radically departed from the XYZ models of Cartesian description. As we have pointed out, though it has been the standard in"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"science, the cubic model does not model the architecture of creation nor the energetics within systems. In COSMOGRAPHY, Fuller restates his premise: \"There is no such thing as a primitive cube, because it is impossible to find any position in which the three edges convergent at each of eight corners will interstabilize themselves at an omni 90 degree position. The way in which human society became academically hooked on the cube was by carving out rectilinearly dimensioned wall building blocks of marble while misassuming an inherent solidness to be demonstrated by the marble.\" \"Despite its universality and elegant economy, the tetrahedron has been all but ignored on planet Earth. Academic science references all its physical mensuration to the XYZ-three-dimensional coordinate system and all of its energetic phenomena to the c-g-s system, which represents the amount of energy required to lift 1 cubic centimeter of water to a given temperature 1 centimeter in 1 second of time. The cube is the chosen geometrical unit of volume measure, and the square is the geometrical unit of areal measure in all of today's world-around, state-of-th-art scientific activity, not to mention everyday use.\" The Triaxial Retrograde Interface, however, contains the graphic capabili ty to represent a virtual spacetime object. Nature's rules for assembly are b ased around the principle of tensegrity, tensional integrity. Every geometr ical structure is a tensegrity. According to Ingber (SciAmer, Jan. 98, p. 48): That nature applies common assembly rules is implied by the recurrence--at scales from molecular to macroscopic--of certain patterns, such as spirals, pentagons, and triangulated forms. These patterns appear in structures ranging from highly regular crystals to relatively irregular proteins and in organisms as diverse as viruses, plankton, and humans. After all, organic and inorganic matter are made of the same building blocks of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The only difference is how the atoms are arranged in three- dimensional space. Geodesic structure is the guiding universal pattern, the building code of nature . We invoke Dr. Fuller's entire body of work to clarify the preceding remarks. Ingber is still arguing against the old paradigm for acceptance of his theorie s about geodesic forms in biological systems, even though they are readily visible. He states: \"The geodesic structure found within the cytoskeleton is a classic example of a pattern that is found everywhere in nature, at many different scales. Spherical groups of carbon atoms called buckminsterfullerenes or buckyballs, along with viruses, enzymes, organelles, cells and even small organisms, all exhibit geodesic forms. Strangely, few researchers seem to have asked why this is so. My view is that this recurrent pattern is visual evidence of the existence of common rules for self-assembly. In particular, all these entities stabilize themselves in thre e dimensions in a similar way: by arranging their parts to minimize energy and"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"mass through continuous tension and local compression--that is, through tensegrity. ...More broadly, all matter is subject to the same spatial constraints, regardless of scale or position. Thus, given these constraints, tensegrity is the most economical and efficent way to build--at the molecular scale, at the macroscopic scale and at all scales in between. It is possible that fully triangulated tensegrity structures may have been selected through evolution because of their structural efficency-- their high mechanical strength using a minimum of materials. ...geodesic forms, such as hexagons, pentagons and spirals, predominate in natural systems.\" The basis of geodesics is circular unity. Circular unity is conserved th rough the fundamental increments of the Holotomic Sequence. Circular uni ty is conserved by the employment of prime numbers only. No redundant multiplexing is required by numbers that contains factors of division , as is the case of the factorials. Thus, the holotomes are the minimal numerical magnitudes to accomodate the maximum amount of consecutive factors of division. When mapped out in a circular array, each of these mathematical entities produce a half-positive, half-negative, symmetrical retrograde mandalog. This is the direct, visual, graphic syntax of a Holotome. The Holotomes are non-arbitrary numerical moduals (dualistic unities). They coherently describe the interrelationships between numbers, particularly the primes. Ideal syntax has been hidden from view due to unconscious disregard of retrocity in at least one of the three primary axes of qualification. \"Ideal syntax\" becomes possible through the concept of word contexts that derive from a rational correlation between quantitative notation and geometrical notation. This graphic syntax is embodied in the Holotomes as rational arrangements of numbers, words, and geometry. By them, we can access or convey information not available within our imperfect literary syntax. As whole systems, the Holotomes contain a definite structure which may be described in words, geometrical structures, graphs, diagrams, etc. The Triaxial Retrograde Interface is the basic imaginary foundation for t he descriptive mechanism of human language. All languages have this fundamental idea event in common, but this has yet to be fully explored through physiomathematical epistemography. Even though words fail to fully explain t he many scenarios that abound in nature, they do point to possibilities and potentials. This is perhaps the archetypal basis of alphanumerics in protolanguages and ancient, classical languages. "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Models of Sacred Space We have shown how six was considered the first perfect number. The results of multiplying or adding the first three integers produces six. In the scientifically systematic discipline of numeronomy, the step from the first perfect number of six (which also represents the second form of unity as sixfold plurality) to the second form of plural unity (twelvefold), represents a step f rom a plane to a 3D volume. Even though the T.R.I. is presented on a flat 2D surface, it can rationally repres ent or model the equation of a cube or sphere with its three ambidirectional axes, representing the six directions of spatial orientation. Archetypally six represents spatial orientation in spacetime (four cardi nal direction, plus a vertical dimension). In ancient times, this comprehension of one's position in spatial reality was essential to survival and renewal by contact with the spiritual dimension. Thus, many rituals and conceptual ideas arose around this recurrent theme. Geometry was always fundamental in this process. The oldest models of this so-called sacred space were cubic, (quadratic magic circles and abstract cubes). The energetic component of geometry was not understood. The crux of the Syndex perspective centers on an energetic version of the cubic model and its geometrical duals, the octahedron and vector equilibrium. We might refer to this model as a cubic non-linearity. Creation of such models revives the archetypal notion of primal creation, the emergence of something from \"nothingness.\" Jungian, Mircea Eliade spoke of such creation myths in his book The Sacred and the Profane , stating: \"The creation of the world becomes the archetype of every human gesture, whatever its plane of reference may be. Every construction or fabrication has the cosmogony as paradigmatic model.\" Even in our modern scientific thinking, this archetypal background is fundamental to our paradigmatic notions about reality. We cannot escape it, even if we try, since it is intrinsic to our being. Techniques of orientation, (aligning oneself to the directions), are designed for the construction of sacred space. The model for the creation of sacred space always begins from a center and projects horizons in t he four cardinal directions. Psychologically, we always reside at the center of \"our world.\" The quadrated circle sets up the conditions necessary for us to enter into sacred time. Then, traditionally, we may contact higher forces through the medium of t he sacred pole or cosmic pillar, the vertical dimension. Eliade points out the great importance of the notion of retrocity in this process."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"\"Sacred time appears under the paradoxical aspect of circular time, reversible and recoverable, a sort of mythical eternal present that is periodically reintegrated by means of rites.\" When we enter this space, in a ritual or even in a thought-experiment, we experience the feeling of immortality, the sense of the presence of Trut h, we feel \"centered\". Sacred space is equivalent psychologically to the \"beginning. \" The principle characteristics of sacred space are: 1). A break in the homogeneity of space; 2). This break is symbolized by an opening where passage from one cosmic region to another is facilitated (i.e. between heaven and earth; earth and th e underworld); 3). Communication with heaven is expressed by variants of the Cosmic Pillar, which stands at the Center of the World. In Ego and Archetype, Jungian, Edward Edinger has identified this Pillar as a useful symbol for what he terms the Ego-Self Axis. It forms the link betwee n ego- consciousness (or personality) and the Higher Self, or cosmic Truth. This represents both the conscious and subconscious mind working together in harmony on the transpersonal level. It is true perception of nature and reality in the timeless sense, or insight. The old mythic models helped establish our relationship to the cosmos and our conscious relationship to totality. It is fundamental to our way of thinking, and explains why metaphor is an important aspect of scientific discovery. Our moder n myths are couched in scientific language, mathematics, and geometry. Scie nce has become our most believable \"religion.\" We therefore suggest the T.R.I. as a modern, paradigmatic representati on of this ancient means of apprehending Reality. If, as Jung and Pauli have suggested, there is unity between psychological and physical realities, they share t he same underpinnings. This commonality between psyche and matter (physics) can be expressed geometrically much better than through words alone. An example from Physics is a six-vectored model for discovering Truth and manipulating alternative realities. This is a scientific, practical application of the cosmic model. For the first time, we can violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, regarding position and velocity of subatomic particles. By condensing atoms from photons, the quantum mechanics of the microcosm become visible in the macrocosmic. An atomic trap is created using six lasers focusing on a single point. According to Cornell and Wieman, SciAmer., March 1998, p. 40-45: \"The Bose-Einstein condensate [ formed at the nexus point of the lasers] ...can be thought of as the matter counterpart of the laser--except that in the condensate it is atoms, rather than photons, that dance in perfect unison.\""},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"\"Einstein showed that if a sample of atoms were cooled sufficiently, a large fraction of them would settle into the single lowest possible energy state in the container. In mathematical terms, their individual wave equations--which describe such physical characteristics of an atom as its position and velocity-- would in effect merge, and each atom would become indistinguishable from any other...the condensate offers a macroscopic window into the strange world of quantum mechanics, the theory of matter based on the observation that elementary particles, such as electrons, have wave properties.\" \"But in the Bose condensation, the wave nature of each atom is precisely in phase with that of every other. Quantum-mechanical waves extend across th e sample of condensate and can be observed with the naked eye. The sub- microscopic thus becomes macroscopic.\" Thus, quantum physics transcends its microcosmic bounds into the classical realm of mechanics. There is a break in the homogeneity of space. \"Einstein's theory requires that the atoms in the condensate have energy that is as low as possible, whereas Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forbids them from being at the very bottom of the trap.\" [We can't know their position and velocity simultaneously]. \"Quantum mechanics resolves this conflict by postulating that the energy of an atom in any container, including our trap, can only be one of a set of discrete, allowable values--and the lowest of these values is not quite zero. THIS LOWEST ALLOWED ENERGY IS CALLED THE ZERO-POINT ENERGY , because even atoms whose temperature is exactly zero have this minimum energy. [ vector equilibrium] Atoms with this energy move around alowly near--but not quite at-- the center of the trap. The uncertainty principle and the other laws of quantum mechanics are normally seen only in the behavior of submicroscopic objects such as a single atoms or smaller. The Bose-Einstein condensate therefore is a rare example of the uncertainty principle in action in the macroscopic world.\" Toward an Ideal Syntax The three ambidirectional axes of the Triaxial Retrograde Interface re present the six directions of spatial orientation: up and down; right and left; fore and aft. On the plane, in the form of the color wheel, we may regard it as circular unity represented by the six qualities or values of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Note the three dipoles as harmony, complimentarity and concommitance. In the volumetric or 3D mode, we can regard the 12-fold unity as spherical or cubic and refer to Fuller's model of Vector Equilibrium with its 12 universal \"degrees of freedom,\" representing nature's most economical movements of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"energy. The 12 closepacked spheres around a thirteenth nucleus form the facets of a dodecahedron with its 8 triangular windows and 6 square windows, which yields 14 windows in all. At this point we have a symmetrical and harmonizing synchronicity of quantity, quality, and form which also includes structure. These are the ingredients of a compound syntax. The T.R.I. does not just deal with a special and isolated case of dynamic retroci ty, but with the three basic pairs of opposing qualities that form the basis of generalized description. It is a graphic means of \"holding the tension of the opposites,\" in a unified model. Such as thinking/feeling; sensation/intuition; judging/perceiving. The Syndex perspective is not only about the intrinsic nature of number, but also the specific way in which number relates to the descriptive mechanism of human languages. The crux of the descriptive mechanism of language revolves around the Greek prefix QU as in WHO and HOW MUCH (identity and plurality) and of course, quantity and quality. This preceded the English prefix WH (as in WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHICH, and WHY). This yields a sixfold coordinate system of the descriptive mechanism: 1 WHO Identity person A 2 WHAT Identity object E 3 WHEN Time duration I 4 WHERE Space extension O 5 WHICH Plurality number U 6 WHY Causality and/or HOW Y Note also that the six vowels are all accounted for and figure qualitatively in the six primary axes of description. The fact that unity is plural and at minimum sixfold gives added credibility to the T.R.I., which is the fundamental paradigm upon which rests the symmetrical unity of the Holotomes. The Sumerian alphabet contained exactly six vowels, three primary and three secondary, which suggests an interesting correspondence between ancient descriptive syntax and the T.R.I. in the color wheel. In a nutshell, this is the epistemographic syntax found in the Holotomic Sequence through the multiplication of the twelvefold spherical unity of Holotome A. We multiply the higher moduals of spherical unity by the prime numbers in their natural order of occurence. The T.R.I. does not just deal with a special and isolated case of dynamic retroci ty, but with the three basic pairs of opposing qualities that form the basis of generalized description. Keep in mind that the term WHICH is the only direction of the six that refers to plurality. The other five deal with ideas that could be s een as qualities."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"WHO and WHAT are qualities that deal with identity (person, object), WHERE with space (extension), and WHEN, with time (duration).

In the case of WHICHness, we mean the first instance of plurality or the num ber two. The second degree of plurality does not occu until the T.R.I. has itself been doubled into the form of twelveness, which involves three dimensional space, (in the form of the dodecahedron). In other words: WHY, HOW, and WHICH are the only ones of the six that can be followed by a question mark. WHO, WHAT, WHEN, and WHERE, can be followed by an exclamation point and/or a question mark. The only exceptions are in exclamations such as: \"That's why!\" or \"That's how!\" or in any context where the WHY and HOW have been qualified. In the case of the color wheel, we have the six qualities of visible light: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet, which consist of three primary and three secondary colors, that is: three discrete pairs, or, a quantity of qualitie s. Since the color wheel is represented on a two dimensional plane, it is not a plurality in a volumetric sense. We must fold (double the plane) in order to bring plurality into a three dimensional entity. The twelve spheres of the dodecahedron surrounding a thirteenth nucleated sphere is then a 3D representation of the Zodiac. The most effective way to understand the quality of six is as the nave of the first holotome with 12 as the node. This also makes the node of Holotome B (24), and its nave would then be the node of Holotome A. Each true Holotome can be represented as a circular unity, but may refer to a spatial or spherical unity. We find that this specific sequence of numerical quantities are the series of minimal magnitudes which accomodate the maxim um amount of consecutive factors of division. When represented on a plane as a spiral, they are graphic depictions of symmetrical half positive, half nega tive retrograde octave cycles. What may be deemed the foundation for an ideal syntax must produce a synchronetic interface between words, numbers, and geometrical forms. This graphic form of syntax which is in total synch with numerical notation produces the only valid presentation of physiomathematical epistomography. It even y ields another quality of semantics, fulfilling the classical suggestion of a truly mathematical language. All Holotomes are examples of circular unity in terms of four positive and four negative event octaves in a retrograde cycle."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The alphanumeric system of notation occupies such a closed loop cycle of 24 signs (Holotome B), 18 consonants and 6 vowels. Working alphabets may employ more or less signs but an ideal syntax requires the perfect symmetry of a Holotome. The Sumerian cuneiform alphabet consisted of 21 letters (six of which were vowels) plus maybe 6 dipthongs making 27 letters. It was possibly formulated from information surviving the deluge, and we can speculate that its loss was involved in the confusion of the tongues (loss of ideal syntax). Anthropologists regard language not just as vocabulary and syntax, but as a cultural phenomenon. The anthropology of rhetoric includes the social use of metaphor. According to Colin Renfrew's theory, (SciAmer; Oct.98, pp. 106-114), the ancestral languages of the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic and Dravidian groups originated quite close together in the Near East about 10,000 years ago. \"The people who built Stonehenge and the other great megalithic monuments of Europe were Indo-Europeans who spoke a form of Indo-European ancestral to the Celtic languages of today...In much of northern Africa the dominant linguistic group is the Afro-Asiatic, which includes ancient Egyptian and the Berber languages as well as the Semitic group. The Dravidian languages of India, and later proto-Dravidian tongue would have been displaced by the Indo- European languages that are now spoken in India.\" It has been proposed that, \" a number of Eurasian language families, including among others, the Indo-European, the Afro-Asiatic, and the Dravidian, are related in a \"superfamily\" they called the Nostratic. The recognition of such superfamilies, which may represent a breakthrough in linguistics, is still regarded as controversial.\" These studies have indicated that there is a close genetic relationship among t he speakers of the Afro-Asiatic, Indo-European and Dravidian languages, among others. In southern India, Dravidian influence still prevails, while northern India is Aryan (Indo-European) influenced. Researchers link the coming of agriculture to the formation and distribution of present-day languages. \"Protolanguages and language groupings as far back as 10,000 B.C. may ultimately open the way to a better understanding of the whole phenomenon of human linguistic diversity.\" Renfrew. According to Berendt, \"The old concept of relationships existing solely between languages of the so-called \"Indo-European family\" cannot be upheld any longer. As the new science of paleolinguistics has shown, there is only one language family, the family of human languages--period. Like so many other myths, the myth of the Tower of Babel is true: In the beginning, there was only one language!\""},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"When linguists trace word sources back along etymological lines, they call the process \" feedback,\" because it is a recursive movement. Linguists have also shown that many primal roots have a so-called mirror root, which does not simply negate the meaning of the primal root but rather reflects it into new dimensions. Consider the derivation of the western Amen from the eastern OM, when it moved from India to the Near East and into Europe: \"The change of sound from OM to Amen reveals two totally different kinds of existence. Amen is a subdivided OM, partitioned into O and M, with each of these parts being further embellished. This happened when OM migrated wes t, first to Israel and then into the Christian world of Europe. Along this rout e it was subdivided into its component parts--just as everything that comes to the West is divided and taken apart, analyzed and dissected. It all seems like the opening move of a truly royal game of chess, like an overture for everything that was yet to come, when one realizes that this process of taking apart and subdividing was heralded thousands of years ago--back when OM became Amen...Indeed, the change from OM to Amen in this way becomes a formula for what separates the East from the West.\" Alphabet is a finite closed loop of holotomic character (numeracy preceded literacy). Ideal syntax depends on the logic contained in the structure of the holotomic sequence. The possible restoration of prediluvial science proceeds from an understanding of number behavior in terms of geometrical form. Graphic synchronicity of quantity and quality occurs in the context of the T.R.I. It dovetails with the Pythagorean 3:4:5 triangle as the fundamental protothing which projects its image in an omnidirectional retrograde octave unity of harmoniousl y polyaxial integrity. It synchronizes geometry, number, and the two ambidirectional operations of arithmatic. As Fuller noted, addition is reverse subtraction and you cannot multiply anything without dividing something. CONCLUSIONS Numeronomy, or the laws governing the behavior of the continuum of quantitative notation is the natural result of numerology, the study of number, with or without the \"woo-woo\" number mysticism which degrades its historical reputation. Numeronomy is the outcome of the right quality and quantity of successful cogitation and proper insight. The numbers speak for themselves through structure and behavior. Each flash that went into the discovery of this grand nexus of synchronetic complexes was beatific joy."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The six key discoveries of the Syndex Theory have always been available to everyone. However, in my own life journey, they emerged through my self- reflexive dialogue with nature and the nature of reality. On the chance I have been understood by the reader, I hope I have been able to impart some choice tidbits. It was my truly mystical luck to meet and talk with some of the most signficant ly accomplished beings in the modern world. I had to go after these giants, but I wanted to get right to the source, rather than simply reading books. Kinesic sign language delivers the gist of a subject which might otherwise require tomes . Once Bucky Fuller indicated the two four-vertexed-each tetrahedra with three fingers of each hand. That graphic gesture imparted a profound insight, a preverbal communique. When we talk about number, we are also talking about talking. Number/geometry is the fundamental cornerstone of human communication and specifically the alphanumeric principle of descriptive notation. The T.R.I. reduces thousands of words down to a principle that contains the fundamental elements of the descriptive mechanism of language in general. It simplifies the numerical/geometrical essence of language, which is primarily a way of describing the empirical scenarios of something we call nature. Ultimately nature and universe may be unknowable. But arguably, truth is born of arithmatic because two plus two is definitely four. In itself number, the sourc e of truth, means nothing. But how we apply it to theory is science which distinguishes us from most other creatures. But not enough to count much in the vast panorama of evolution! The T.R.I. represents the geonumerical basis of the sequence of minimal pluralities that accomodate the maximum amount of divising factors. This specia l series is terminologically designated as the Holotomic Sequence (holo- as i n holistic; tome as in book or information containment module). The holographic aspect of this sequence is that each member or tome contains all of the geometrical qualities and numerical quantities of th e previous holotome, plus the added degree of data content over the previous module. A major feature of these data modules is a retrograde symmetry in the form of a half positive and half negative octave system predicated on the octave nature of the so-called base ten system of number. The full signficance of this most simple observation has escaped the understanding of all previous number theorists. The base ten system of number is an octave system, where either one or nine can be seen as a null value event. Furthermore, this octave can be regarded as a cyclic function. The zero, one, or nine can function as the null event which acts as the null value gap between the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"beginning and ending of the octave retrograde cyclation, due to its half positive and half negative symmetrical cycle (which may negate the numerical value of one or nine just as if they were of the same nature as the zero). A good example of the symmetrical retrograde octave cycle can be seen in t he multiples of nine, where the nave of the retrograde reversal occurs between 45 and 54, or precisely at 49.5: 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 49.5 half forward half reverse full octave Due to the octave nature of the eight true numbers, no transpalindromic sequence can exceed an octave cycle. As simple as this is, the greatest math experts in modern times have totally overlooked this crucial element to the proper comprehension of number behavior. The very phrase \"Number One\" is self-contradictory. No wonder the ancients designated zero or one as Aleph--THE FOOL.... This overview led Marshall to the epochal rediscovery of the 99 CYCLOFLEX, an abbreviated term for octave cycloscillation, which is the long sought exemplary base wave that continues indefinitely through the continuum of the base ten system of quantitative notation. We have adopted this valid term to help clarify the behavior of the cyclic and reciprocating nature of the interaction of nine and eleven in the exemplary 99 wavecycle. Further abbreviation of cycloscillation is the shorter term, cyc loflex. In each cycle we have a full oscillation: one up and one down (or fore and aft). The cycle to wave ratio in the holotomes is that a whole number series of oscillations can occur in one complete 360 degree cycle. In the 99 CYCLOFLEX, we have 49 1/2 numbers that are either palindromes or transpalindromes. There are in fact twelve discrete classes of numb er, determined by whether a number reversed falls in the same class or is a combination of two classes. An example is number 16, the only two-digit square that is a prime when reversed as 61. The retrograde symmetry of the 99 CYCLOFLEX is complex and cannot be seen without the adoption of the TWELVE GLYPHS described at length elsewhere, (Part Three). The step from circular unity described in the color wheel to the cubic or spherica l unity of the T.R.I. is accomplished by doubling the first perfect number which then may be expressed as the 12 spheres all touching a thirteenth nucleus sphere producing the triangle/square surface of the dodecahedron."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Altogether, this in effect establishes the synchronicity of number and geometr y on a plane and then produces the first instance of spherical and cubic synchronicity of number and geometry in 3-dimensional space. The triangle is an expression of number three as a minimal plane synchronicit y, and the tetrahedron a minimal expression of 3-D spacetime and number four. By forming the dodecahedron, we archieve a spherical symmetry which begins the sequence of hotomoic close packing which can also be represented on either the surface of a plane, or the volume of 3-D space. An analogy can also be made between the point, the line, plane, and cube. Number is just another name for geometry. Throughout recorded history, the Auric Key is manifested in myriad ways and under a wide variety of titles: THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE; the white st one, the holy chalice, the Emerald Tablet, etc. The esoteric traditions of the Sufi masters and the basic tenets of all major religions dealt exclusively with these universal laws of nature, which may only truely be expressed in the universal nature of number/geometry. But for the most part, the true understanding of these laws have remained dormant in human understanding, due to the inclinations of human avarice, greed, and hate in the interpretation of the most ancient and holistic meaning contained in the original notations from deepest antiquity. In other words, at various times, they were intentionally concealed from the profane for a variety of self-serving purposes. This is why, as we approach the Millennium, Syndex offers a radically new perspective--one open to all who would understand. This is not the threshold of the Apocalypse and destruction, but the threshold of the new Epoch, the Epochalypse, a bold new era for mankind, based on fundamental harmony and understanding of nature and nature's laws essential to our continuing survival.

Buhler Science 85, Nov. My personal contemplation of the sequential behavior of number actually began around 1957 when I engaged myself in a translation of the biaxial Mendeleyef. Table of Elements. I spiralled them in a paraphrasing which elucidated a number of very interesting coincidences regarding the positions of the inert gases, active me tals, etc. Many coincidences jumped out as valid synchronicities. I began to view and think of t his compound spiralic complex of identificational events as the spectrum of atomic sta bility modulations which exuded a totally rational series of major interrelationships .

A graphic platform by which an ideal form of syntax can exhibit self-replic atory, or self- referential characteristics. Although based on what may be regarded as se lf-evident ideas, the very act of producing a legitimate title of self-description has proved to be a f unction of enhancing simplicity and also produces the no so clear cources of paradox and ambiguity that plague conventional syntax with confusion of an otherwise unclear sourc e.

I can make this seemingly presumptuous statement with total confidence beca use number cannot lie. Truth cannot exist in any other arena than nature herself.

Utopia or oblivion are the options of the spirit, whose only guide is the truth invested in the numbers and forms that dictate the words with which we think. It is time we become familiar with the source of our very imagination. Or is our imagination the product of some source beyond anything that we can even imagine?

This is partially due to my lack of faith in dictionarity, much of which has resulte d since I've concluded that the computer has virtually become the judge of which words to include and exclude.

The T.R.I. with the six vowels and six interdependent facets of description is only a s tep in the process of enhancing the true relationship of quantity and quality. The Holotomic Sequence is the magic crystal that produces the valid logic of the prehistoric s ource of 360 degree circular unity, upon which rests the metrology of our current universal industrial culture. My source of etymological and epistomological insight was due to a collection of dictionaries lost to fire in Idaho in 1964. One was prewebster before English had 26 letters. My number interests began when I noticed Paramahansa Yogananda mentioned that #108 was the Hindu number of the Universe: OM. I decided to do a radial version of the Mendeleyef biaxial display, and needing a limit for my array I coined a ter m \"Infusorium.\" When many correspondences and synchronicities emerged, I as sumed the ancient Hindus were onto something very modern in terms of number technology. My initial attempts were somewhat naive, but now we have the T.R.I. which is the tool box. Number/geometry and the two fundamental ambidirectional operations of arithma tic are the contents of this box. We draw a line between the tools and the work performed: a rational and operable context in place of an unorganized regard for words that can chan ge meaning through the context in which they are used. The intrinsic nature of the number continuum has been progressively forgotten in that once we learned how to use these tools, there was not much use in understanding their fundamental nature. This does not necessarily mean that this ancient knowledge is of no present use. Time changes everything. But this is not my concern. I am a numeronomist, not a mathematician. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"TOTAL RETROCITY IS THE KEY TO RATIONAL SYNTROPY The number one, (even though one is not a number) function of universe is retrocity. There are three interactive axes of retrocity to be exact. These thre e ambidirectional axes cross each other in the center of our conscios regard for that which exists in front of us , behind us, to our right, to our left, and above and below us. A fourth element of retrocity also seems to exist, but not in an axial sense. I t is actually a synthesis of the other three. We will call this the inward and outward which are such perfect reflections of the three basic retrocities that the micro and ma cro universe are actually transverbal identities of such nature that no one can really know which is whi ch. Though there doesn't seem to be any way to prove it, the macro is the micro and visa versa. Three basic axes of retrocity cross the centrum of the fourth synthestic retrocity in such a way that what we refer to as universe is actually a four dimensional ambisymmetriverse. Everything is the actual reversal of what it appears to be. I call this the theory of total retrocity. This theory does away with the absurdity of the Big Bang, and accomodates a comprehensive idea of total time reversal inasmuch as you are required to ig nore some specific direction in order to observe its opposite. There are rare cases of people who have the ability to remember bits of the f uture. Just like it is possible for most of us to forget bits of the past. So far I have worked out the logical mechanics of total retrocity in the rea lm of number. Since number is the fundamental platform of the alphnumeric system of linguisti c notation, it is only a matter of turning myself wrong side out in order to clarify my vision of total retrocity to those who are totally incapable of looking in all directions simultaneously without getting dizzy. The source of absurdity, ambiguity, and chaos can be found in the process of descriptional mechanisms that begin in the idea of retrocity. One is not a number, but a n instance of singularity, and singularity is not reversible. Two on the other hand, is the first instance of plurality and being composed of a pair of singularities can be regarded as a duality which gives rise to the idea which i n turn permits the concept of a dualism of identity. It therefore creates a contex t for the notion of retrocity. The major source of terms in any dictionary is names and their antenyms, up and down, hot and cold, ambitious and lazy, i.e. most of descriptive language is polar, which accounts for the importance of number two as a primary idea.

It is totally uncontemplatable."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Number three has the important distinction of being able to represent a plane. The ideal form is a triangle. It may be said that a triangle is a qualitative repr esentation of the quantitative number three. In a similar sense, four has the distinction of being able to represent a geomet rical volume, the ideal form being a tetrahedron. In this case it may be said that a te trahedron is a qualitative representation of the quantitative number four. This preamble is to bring notice that only six of the base digits can represent three - dimensional spatial figures, i.e. six quantitative signs that possess the qualit ative features of space occupying entities. The majority of problems that number theorists have ha d in synchronizing number and form (geometry) has been due to the issues here pointed out. Part of the reason that six is the first perfect number is because only six of the bas e numbers deal with volume space. Number twelve is the first ideal synchronicity of quantity and qualit y because the dodecahedron is 12 spheres all kissing a thirteenth nucleus sphere. It is a plural synchronicity of quality and quantity. We start by realizing that the descriptive mechanism of language has a se rious flaw, because in nature a paradox just does not happen. Ambiguity and paradox result from ignoring at least one half of the three ambidirectional axes of spatial des cription. In regards to the behavior of the number train this can produce confusion regarding positive and negative numbers, sperarated by a zero null event and the exemplary 99 octave cycle whose nave is 49.5.

They are impossible to recognize without such innovative epistomographic disciplines, such as thi s resurrection of ancient knowledge. Number/geometry helps us think about complex systems.

Both sides share the opposite being of each other as a unity. Duality or twoness is depende nt on the idea of retrocity. Or, it can be said that retrocity is prequantitative. No speculations can be conside red appropriate to the analysis of plural notation unless retrocity is recognized a s a necessary element of the context of description.

Our kindergarden (or Eden) experience cannot forewarn us of the hair-splitting, se mantic loop holes in the fundamental ideas that have gone into the formation of the alphanumeric principles of \"thinking with words,\" on which our view of the cosmos initially depends. In the complex and long-winded philosophic overviews of formal logic, much has been occulted of the supersimplistic nature of human communication on its most concrete level. This is especially true due to terms of such elevated levels of abstra ction that all actual meaning is totally non-existent, yet we place such terms in the very positions critical to syntactic function. To the Anglophonic mind, the word God is synonymous with number, not because the Tetragrammaton is a cosmic quartet, but because God discovered the word in six day s and the word was with God, and the number of his creation was six... Other words, like infinity, instantaniety, eternity, etc. have no other meaning than t hat which we impress by virtue of some indistinct function of the imagination. Discrete levels of finitude in an octave loop of four progressively additive and f our subtractively negative event octaves with a ninth null event can be said with a 3- dimensional picture on a 2-dimensional surface. All we need do is keep in mind the fact that the map is a shadow of a purely imaginary scene composed of data. It contains no true information of any kind. All perceptions are filtered through the sensory and me ntal processes, and are therefore second-hand to any \"objective reality.\" The SYNDEX initiative strives to eliminate the non-essential and problem-cr eating terminological habits of the presemantic world. If, in fact, prediluvial beings informed the Sumerians with a twenty one letter alphabet, (six of which were vowels), they no doubt had some terminological equivalent of the sacred words semantics, the knowledge of a n ideal syntax.

With tha t exemplary wave, we are about to ride to a clarified vision of destiny on the bright hori zon of mystical exactitude. Epistomographic syntax is the ideal beginning for transcendental vision, but many strange and forgotten scenarios preceded even that. So, never lose sight of retrocity in any one of its three fundamental situations. We can follow it back to the source. The source of my animosity is the neglect of retrocity. To really get a- head, you get the monster by the tail and never ever turn loose for any reason whatsoever. For the monster will take you to a place where no one has ever been for a time beyond measure. It i s like the serpent Ourobouros which devours its own tail, eternally recycling itself. Dictionary definitions show us the deficiencies within our thinking. I am shocked at not finding the word retrocity in any polylingual lexicons. Even the definition of the w ord retrograde is insufficient: going or moving backwards, apparently moving fr om east to west as a planet; BECOMING LESS HIGHLY ORGANIZED; to go backwar ds. As if it were an entropic, not syntropic concept!"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"To prove the point, J.S. Bach's Retrograde Fugue, or Crab Canon is, in fact, an example of a higher form of symmetry where the second half of the overall scor e is a perfect reversal of the primary half. This is the definitive meaning of the term symmetry, where the structure or form of morphological unity represents a perfect mirror reflection of either/both of it s two sides. Symmetry is ambiretrocity, pure and simple. The term retrocity is a mos t vital concept in the Syndex analysis of number behavior. The reverse nature of the number continuum has been totally neglected in the classical regard for the baseten continuum of quantitative notation. The fact that palindromic numbers occur at seemingly chaotic intervals woul d seem to prompt an investigation of the possibility of their transpalindromic counterpart but so far as I have been able to deduce, no one else has pursued this proposition. The TWELVE SYNDEX GLYPHS identify the ambidirectional character of a ny individual numerical signature. They are totally necessary in the explorat ion of number behavior. We cannot describe the true nature of the numerical continuum without the systematic mechanism of ambidirectional distinctions made manifest by thi s or some similar graphic proceedure. Even though an infinite progression of quantitative identities exist, as far as we w ish to pursue distinctions, we have in the Holotomes twelve transfinite classes of number . They permit a wholly rational sequence of interactive moduals of finite and theref ore rational behaviors. They permit the physiomathematical syntax that is not possible wi thout an interdependent range of finite levels of arithmatic congruency not available to an open- ended series of quatitative labelled plural identifications. Discrete levels of finitude within other discrete levels of finitude is exac tly what is occuring with the addition of each subsequent addition of integericity. With the recognition of the twelvefold nature of numerical classification, we abandon t he absurdity of the infinite continuum of number, which leads us nowhere. We opt in favor of a totally structured continuity of circular unities that interac t in a rational epistomography that involves the essential arithmatic that disting uishes quantity, quality and the whole range of operations that we refer to as mathematics. The primes do in fact occur in a totally rational order which is of such an el egant and rational distribution that it makes one wonder why it went unnotice d for millennia. Each of the major sacred or holy books contains the key to this ancient enigma, but so far as I can ascertain, I am the only dividual to successfully interpret the cru cial information to find the embedded pattern. The major key to the orderly distribution of prime numbers is revealed in the distinction between palindromic and transpalindromic number. Unless one can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with total ambidexterity, he has no right to deem himself a number cruncher.

This book is not about number mysticism, or numerology. No occult t heory of numbers is presented, no cosmic code of alien descent, no ideologies. Rather , it outlines the history of numbers and writing an d the ancient science of astronomical measurements. Class ical cultures are characterized by certain general basic ideas, of which metrology is foremost. We show why c ertain cultures considered certain numbers \"divine, \" and why we should turn our attention to them in mod ern times. Most of these numbers seem to have originated in Su merian culture and are the result of geodesic and cosmological measurements (such as the Precession o f the Equinoxes) discovered thousands of years ago, in the mists of prehistory. These numbers are importan t in certain inherent rhythms in the base-10 system of numeration. These synergetic qualities have hithert o remained unnoticed in classical number theory. INTRODUCTION to the Philosophical and Scientific Background \"Number makes its appearance in this context as the vinculum amoris, the bond of love which unites the two principles [psyche and matter] by jointly ordering them. In its profoundest sense number thus possesses the signif icance of an all-uniting Eros, although it connotes something different from th e usual sense of the words love and Eros...Because there seems to exist such a clear spiritual \"objective\" order at the base of Eros, it is expressed in the seemi ngly abstract, feelingless, impersonal order of numbers, as a clear, immutable factor free from illusions...this cosmic ordering of the Self constitutes th e ultimate mystery behind all human desire and behavior, an unfathomable and fearsome mystery.\" M.L. von Franz, Number and Time , p292-3 \"The unexpectedness of a mathematical result gives us the feeling that it is not our own creation, that the world of number exists in its own right, while its necessity and symmetry are bal m after the ragged edges of life, or pure joy to those who do n ot yet know them.

Fuller letter to Bob Marshall, 3/3/81 NUMBER MYSTICISM & ALPHANUMERIC WRITING Number mysticism reached a zenith in ancient Greece, since the Greeks were fascinated with the essence of the integers themselves to the point of worshipful devotion. The relation between numbers (and number words) and magic remained alive throughout the ages. It is visible in Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy, the Qabala, and various other forms of religious mysticism. The Pythagoreans believed that numbers were the key to understanding the order of t he universe, and to them numbers meant whole numbers or integers. They believed that the soul could ascend through the spheres, to eventual union with God, by means of mathematics. This peculiar fascination with numbers as individuals created an obs tacle to developing a collective theory of numbers, i.e. arithmetic. The main thread of the number concept in the crossroads cultures passed from Sumeria - Akkadia-Babylonia to Phoenicia to Hellenistic (and Hebrew), to Indian to Isla mic to European cultures. Key numbers, cosmic cycles, and divine numbers permeate the number concepts of all these cultures. The Greeks and Hebrews had alphanumeric systems which developed into numerology and numberword mysticism. Number mystics from the Pythagoreans onward considered number 'one' as the I nfinite God, the First Cause, the One who transcends all multiplicity. To the Greeks, numbers were divine concepts, ideas in the mind the god who had fashioned the world. God was a great mathematician. In the Hebrew Qabala, the world is made with numbers and le tters. In more accurate terms, the characters representing manifestation wer e alphanumeric. Whether 'one' was actually a number at all was answered by the concept tha t it is the essence or underlying principle of number. All the numbers are made of it. In the West , ten (10) is the number of completion and perfection which returns the essential number s back to unity. In China, eleven is the number of Tao , but not in the quantitative sense of ten plus one, but signifying the unity of the decade in its wholeness. Jung echoes these ancient sentiments in Memories, Dreams, and Reflections (pp. 287 f.) by stating: One, as the first numeral, is unity. But it is also \"The unity,\": the O ne, All-oneness, individuality and non-duality--not a numeral but a philosophical concept, an arche type and attribute of God, the monad. In Number and Time , M.L. von Franz carries this thought further: The number one possesses these unique qualities to a particular degree...it does n ot multiply by itself, or reduce itself by division because it is a divisor of all other"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"numbers...It is the first triangular and also the first square number...it ha s no predecessor. In this sense it does not yet \"count\"; if it did it would be the fi rst uneven prime number...in mathematics the number one is not reckoned among prime numbers. This is supported by experimentation: \" dealing with the wave configurations of sand vibrations on thin plates of metal, all prime numbers figure with the exception of the one.\" Influenced by Pythagorean ideas and Qabala, in which 10 Sephiroth (Spheres) emana te from God, the occult tradition asserts that the succession of numbers 1 through 10 symbolizes and is, in fact, identical with the emanation of the manifest Universe . The 22 letters of the alphanumeric Hebrew alphabet contained and created the secret st ructure of all things. The SEFIR YETZIRAH , the Book of Creation or Formation (300-600 AD) describes how God created the manifest universe by means of letters and numbers which are the foundation of all things. The letters are part of ' one body ,' the alphabet which is an extension of God's own being. All created things, made by means of the let ters, are also parts of the one body which is God. True being for the Hebrew is the 'word,' dabhar , which comprises all Hebraic realities: word, deed, and concrete object. Non-being, nothing (no thing) is signified correspondingly by 'not word,' lo dabhar. In European magical tradition, the most important of all alphanumeric alphabets i s the Hebrew which had 22 letters, all of which were consonants. Vowels were inferred fr om context. Contemplation (theory) and application (practice) is the mystical tr adition of Qabala. In this alphabet there are no vowels (our a,e,i,o, and u) represented. The same i s true of the older Phoenician (Canaanite) alphabet, from which our own alphabet is descended--by way of the Greek, Etruscan, and Latin alphabets. All over the ancient orient, in Assyria and Babylonia, as well as Egypt, the w ord and particularly the word of God, was not only nor even primarily an expression of thought; it was a mighty and dynamic force. The Assyrians and Babylonians conceived of the divi ne word under the image of a physical-cosmic power. In Egypt, the power of creating and sustaining everything was traced back to the divine word, the ever-active fluid or ethereal divine substance proceeding out of the mouth of divinity. For example, in Memphis, Ptah is the Creator of the world. The specific organ of creation is ' the mouth which named all things .' ALPHANUMERIC WRITING All things nameable can be recorded or counted by symbols for things. Writing ( like naming) is an ancient, magical art, assumed to have been invented by the gods. Emerg ing around 3200 B.C., writing contained mysterious, hidden, even divine Wisdom, for those contemporary minds. The archaic history of writing records its evolution from"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"pictographs and ideograms, to phonetic and syllabic cuneiform, and the alphabetic form, whose sequential letters are also used as numbers. Certain milestones in the development of alphanumeric characters have been document ed archaeologically. Interaction along trade routes in crossroads cultures contributed both to the development (from syllabic hieroglyphics and phonetic cuneiform), and dispersa l of a letter sequence which could be adapted to the phonetics of local dialects. A tablet has been found from the 14th Century B.C. showing Ugaritic letters arran ged opposite a column of known Babylonian syllabic signs, which supplied the sounds for the characters a, be, ga---and so on---in basically the same order and roughly the same sounds that would appear 300 years later in the Phoenician alphabet. By 1000 B.C., the Phoenician alphabet had come to full flower. According to Isaac Asimov (1989), this is why the alphabet was never invented independently by any other society: \"Between the Egyptians and the Babylonians were the Canaanites, inhabiti ng the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, (the Greeks called them the Phoenicians). They were traders who acted among other things, as intermediaries between the Egyptians and Babylonians. It was necessary for such traders to know both the Egyptian and Babylonian languages, and that was a hard chore indeed.\" \"It occurred to some nameless Canaanite to simplify writing by adopting a kind of shorthand. Why not give a separate symbol to each of the common sounds made by human beings in speaking a language? You could then build up any words of any language by using those sound-symbols. Sound-symbols had, in fact, been used by the Egyptians, but they also preserved symbols for syllables and for whole words. The Canaanite inventor had the notion that the sound symbols should be used exclusively and that words should be built up out of them.\" That same alphabet could be used as numerals.

There is obviously a real advantage in the use of single symbols for single sounds, compared with thousands of symbols for representing things or ideas (pictograms). T he simplicity of alphabetic writing removed the monopoly on learning. The alphabet expanded literacy. But all alphabets are inherently flawed, or at least limited. The shortcomi ng is that it lacks the delicate variations necessary to indicate all the subtleties of t he human voice. So perfection has eluded any alphabet for that would mean the accurate rendering of every speech-sound. In an ideal alphabet each sound would have to be represented by a single letter, and eac h letter would be limited to one sound. Every alphabet so far has omitted symbols for some sounds, and most have contained redundant letters. The adaption of a script to a language is not easy when it contains sounds not occuring in the speech from which it was borrowed. In any event, the prototype of alphabetic writing was spread by the Phoencians . Local scribes embellished it, or pared it down and evolved local variations.

Romans adopted only 21 letters from the early Etruscan alphabet, as well as their names for letters, which were different from the ones Greeks derived from S emitic letter names. It made writing far easier to learn with its economy of symbols, and its dire ct relationship to the sounds of spoken languages and numbers. Literacy spread dramatically. COSMIC CYCLES OF CREATION & DESTRUCTION THE HINDU DOCTRINE OF YUGAS After the burning and plundering of the Hellenistic Library at Alexandria, Eg ypt, the exact science of ancient mathematics was lost to the west. The vanguard o f mathematical discovery passed to medieval India. Hindu mathematicians had little direct influence on Europe. But it is certain tha t the Arabs got their arithmetic and algebra from Brahmin knowledge. Caliphs ente rtained Indian mathematicians in the ninth and tenth centuries. Both Sansrit and Greek class ics of science were avidly translated into Arabic during the Moslem Empire. The Crusaders were exposed to this Arab knowledge in the Holy Land, and their knowledge gradually penetrated Europe also through Islamic Spain (Toledo). Th is led directly to a revival of European learning after the Middle Ages. Therefore, we attribute our present system of so-called Arabic numer als to those near-eastern cultures which preserved them through Europe's Dark A ges. However, this decimal system of numeration originated in India and was one of the man y kinds of knowledge translated into Arabic during the cultural flow ering of that area. The numerical characters and such notions as the zero and place valuation came directly into modern society from India, even though they had been te ntatively used in older societies. Prior to the introduction of Hindu numerals, the alphanumeric charac ters developed by the Phoenicians predominated. Numbers were represente d by the letters of an alphabet in their spoken succession. Both the Greeks (800 B .C.) and the Hebrews adopted this principle. Not only the alphabet, but the sounds of the letters were retained. This adoption of an alphanumeric model led to the mathematical backwater of Gematri a where every sum was a word or many words, and every word had a numerical equivalent . Number mysticism then concerned itself with various cryptographic messages and numerical codes. While good for mysticism and possibly promoting superstition, it wa s"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"no favor to the advancement of mathematics. The old Phoenician \"acrophonic\" numerals were abbreviations of number words. Alphanumerics permeated the crossroads cultures . Cultural concepts of time, real and divine, differ dramatically and underlie and c ondition each culture's worldview. The background of Hindu cosmology and science has its roots in the crossroads cultures. It involves notions of time and history, astronomy, and the i dea of the Divine Word. Ethnopsychology, psychology of language, philosophy of language, logic of languag e, semantics and comparative linguistics show that, relatively speaking, Hebrew thinking is dynamic and temporal, while Greek thinking is static and spatial--even the Greek conception of time is spatial--boundless. The concept of number can be understood either as spatially quantitati ve or dynamically qualitative quantities. For the temporally-oriented Jews, ther e is an inner connection between plurality and intensity. Hebrew thinkin g moves in time, while the Greeks employ space as their thought-form. Hebrews used a lu nar calendar, while Greeks used the solar year. Both Indo-European and Semitic languages reveal a cross-cultural ambiguity when using spatial expressions to designate tempral notions. \"Before\" and \"behind\" can me an \"future\" and \"past.\" This double temporal meaning of the same words reveals tw o different notions of time, as eternal rhythms. In Semitic languages, the notion of recurrence coincides with that of duration. Time is the stream of events, the hist orical content of occurrence. The European sense of time is a confused mixture of time and space, a legacy of Gree k thought. The Indo-Germanic framework of past, present, future is foreign to Semi tic thinking where tense comes principally from the dynamic of completed or inc omplete action. Our modern concept of time is spatialized. For us actions are oriented objectively , impersonally and spatially; the ancient Hebrews thought subjectively, pers onally, and temporally. Europeans got both space/time views mixed together as Bible cosm ology. These notions came down ambiguously because the Hebrews had no notions of firm boundaries to objects, while the Greeks delighted in thinking geometrically. They relate to quantity and number as spatially quantitative (Greek) and dynamically quali tative quantities (Hebrew). The Hebrew language has no expressions for the simplest geometric figur es such as the triangle, quadrilateral, or square, nor the corresponding adjectives. Num bers are distinguished qualitatively as rhythms, each with its own peculi arity. The form and syntax of the Hebrew numbers two to ten indicate that the smallest and basic numbers were thought of as qualitatively different totalities. From the re it was just a step further to the conception of holy numbers...concrete numerical gestalts, an int uitive quality adhering to a totally unarticulated general impression of quantity. H ebrew plural forms are preferably designated as intensive."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"God revealed himself to Israel in History, not Ideas. Therefore, the Israel ites developed no mathematical science, though it flourished in neighboring Phoenician and Mesopotamian cultures. The mathematical ideas of the Greeks cannot be comprehended without b ringing geometry into the inquiry. The Greek Ideas were geometrical basic forms , the eternal blueprint of reality. Space perception is the given thought-form of the Greeks, and the visible form of things occupied their attention. Geometry for them was the most important branch of mathematics. The Greeks, including Euclid, thought geometrically even when they dealt with numbe rs. The square was a visual representation of the second power and the cube of the third. For the Greeks, the concept of large, quantity (largeness) was mostly a spat ial idea. The Indian concept of time has differences and similarities with t he Greek and Hebrew notions revealed by linguistics of their respective languages. Language (syntax, grammar, verb tenses, etc.) displays the basic worldview of a cultur e, notions about how real-time experiences are processed and conditioned by the basic philos ophy of a culture. Linguistic perculiarities come from the underlying assumpti ons about existence in time and space, perception, being and becoming, active/passive, etc . Like the Greeks, the Indian view of time is static, that is it is conceived sta tically rather than dynamically, as the Jews also do. The early Greek, Heraclitus posits that flux and becoming aloneare real, permanence and constancy are merely apparent. T he Hindus believe the exact opposite. Indians recognize, of course, that the things of this world are always moving and changing. But the substance of things is seen as basically unchanging; its underlying reality is unaffected by the ceaseless flux. Indian thought places a high val ue on universality, and the connection between this, and the static conception of phenomena, is of course not accidental. \"The one remains, the many change and flee.\" The static conception of time permeates Indian thought. It could hardly fail to do so, f or it is present in the very forms of language itself, conditioning all philosophical thi nking. In classical Indian languages, there are no words corresponding to the concept \" to become.\" \"T o become\" is \"to exist.\" \" Being born \" and \" existing \" come from the same root. So to become is to be born. Indians express change at all as \" being otherwise. \" Becoming is expressed in terms of being; dynamic is seen as a phase of static. This point of view permeates the lang uage and conditions the philosophy. The classic Western expression of the sense of flux uses a vivid and specific ve rb: \"All things flow.\" The corresponding idea in India is expressed in Sanskrit as sarvan anityam, \" all existences are impermanent. \" It always directs the attention away from the action to the stable state of the actor, from the changing aspect of the action to the unchan ging"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"universal: \" to appear \" does not equal \" appearance ;\" nothing can disappear or arise. The adverb isn't even a part of speech in Sanskrit. In Indian philosophy, the Absolute is a Being beyond all temporal appearances . These exist and change in time; the Absolute is essentially static. Th e great unborn Self is imperishable, incorruptible, eternal, fearless Brahman, whic h is coequivalent with Atman. Indian philosophers replaced the concept of Becoming with three aspe cts of temporal existence: Appearance, Extinction and Continuance, which ar e fundamentals in their cosmology. All three states are clearly conceived as st atic. Here is a similarity to Platonic thought: Plato formulated the antithesis bet ween Being and Becoming with the true essence of reality consisting of changeless, timel ess Forms. This is why geometry was important, but Greek physical sciences only dev eloped statics. Modern scientific thought, in contrast is concerned with kinetics, dynamics, syne rgetics. Preoccupied with a more metaphysical time-sense, the numbness to the passage and flow of specific events makes non-Indians regard Indians as lacking in common sense. They simply do not seem to have a clear awareness of discrimination of \"real time,\" hi storical time, and it shows in their language through the discrimination of tense. Children in India will ask you, \" What is time? ,\" not \" what time is it? \" The difference between absolute past and relative past is not clearly made in the Indian language. Terms can be determined only through context. They don't grasp tim e quantitatively, and with historical accuracy. They exist through multiple l ives repeated in limitless time: appearance, extinction, continuance, over and over through cosmic cycles of creation and destruction. According to the Indian worldview, the universe, the world and social order are ete rnal. The personal is fleeting, and the basic assumption of transmigration is pervasive in language, thought, and philosophy. So, passing phenomena have no real significance, and no importance is given to providing them with accurate dates. In quasi-historical f ashion they resort to hyperbole, idealization, and exaggerate to astronomical proportions . Therefore, much of Indian so-called history is confabulated, the product of pure imagination. They are more interested in religion and poetry than historical documentation. Pr oper observance of ancient precepts is stronger than the regard for historical acc uracy. They contemplate eternal paradigms of human experience which are by their nature t imeless and in that sense, outside history. This is a contemplative orientation and worldview, expressed in the forms of Sanskrit itself. In sanskrit, it is \"effect and cause\" syntactically, rather tha n the Western \"cause and effect.\" The Western order of thought is to proceed temporally from cause to e ffect; the relationship is seen in time."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"In Sanskrit, progressive phenomena are seen as already complete. Rather than \" the relation of the knower and the knowable,\" it is \"the relation of the knowable and the knower.\" This way of thinking is retrospective and different from the approach which starts from the cause. Things are evaluated in terms of a final cause or aim, a teleol ogical relation. But Indians do have a concept of abstract time and changing phases of t he world. They just adhere to the universal principle that whatever is subj ect to organization is subject also to destruction, in lesser or greater duration. There is no substance which abides forever. All matter is force; all su bstance is motion; every individual is unstable; all things pass away. Modern physic s, the bastion of science's \"cause and effect\" confirms this curiously enou gh through inductive and deductive reasoning which would be alien to Indian thou ght. All this is the essential background on Indian language, thought, and philosophy which provides the fertile matrix from which their cosmology of cosmic cycles of c reation and destruction arose. In fact, the philosophy conditioned the language and vice versa. And the nutshell of this philosophy and language is contained in the divine rootsyllable, the sacred numberword AUM, the sound of the mystery of the Word everywhere, whose personal realization is a peak experience. Joseph Campbell explains AUM in THE POWER OF MYTH(1988): AUM is a word that represents to our ears that sound of the energy of the unive rse of which all things are manifestations. You start in the back of the mouth \"ah h,\" and then \"oo,\" you fill the mouth, and \"mm,\" closes the mouth. When you pronoun ce this properly, all vowel sounds are included in the pronunciation. AUM. Consonants are here regarded as interrutions of the essential vowel sound. All words are thu s fragments of AUM, just as all images are fragments of the Form of forms. AUM is a symbolic sound that puts you in touch with that resounding being that is the u niverse. To be in touch with that and to get the sense of that is the peak experience of all. A-U-M. The birth, the coming into being, and the dissolution that cycles back. AUM is called the \"four-element syllable.\" What is the fourth element? The s ilence out of which AUM arises, and back into which it goes, and which underlies it. My lif e is the AUM, but there is silence underlying it too. That is what we would call th e Immortal. As well as philosophy, Hindu cosmology also mixed space and time concepts derived from astronomical and geodetic measurements. They were influenced by the ancient Sumerian lunar reckoning which came with the Aryan invasion, and is, in fact, the lega cy of all neolithic cultures. Later Hellenistic notions permeated their astr onomy. The figure the ancients used to define the circumference of the earth came from their foot and their cubit. These two numbers, 1296 and 864, are basic to many ancient systems of measure."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Is it a coincidence that a circle of 1,296,000 units has a radius of 206,265 units, the length of both an English and Egyptian cubit? The Hebrew shekel weighs 129.6 grams, and the English guinea 129.6 grains. The measure of the Holy of Holies in Solomon's Temple was 1296 inches. 129600 is the numeric basis for astronomical measures and played a role in Plato's mys tic symbolism. Multiples and submultiples of 12960 are easily memorized: 1728, 864, 720, 432, 360 , 216, 180, 90, 40, 36 , 20, 16, 10, 8, 5, 4, 2. These sacred numbers were used everywhere in the building of sacred temples. The Babylonian Tablet ( Igi-Gal-Bi) uses all of them, plus 144, 162, and 810. In IDEAL METROLOGY, W. H. Wood points out the meaning of these figures in the East: \" In the law of the yoga, all periodic actions developed under the inspiration of The Invisible are measured by ideal cycles, expressed in geometric form by th e number 1296 in thousands or thousands of thousands. The third stage of Yoga is represented by the third of 1296 or 432, which is considered the symbol of consecration, or standing in harmony with nature's beauty and order. The exalted life of a disciple of Buddha called for a cycle of 4320 million years.\" In his classic, THE BOOK , Alan Watts points to the Hindu myth which says that as time goes on, life in the world gets worse and worse until at last the destructive as pect of the Self, the god Shiva dances a terrible dance which consumes everything in fire. Ther e follows, says the myth 4,320,000 years of total peace during which the Self abides in itself and does not play or hide. Then the game begins again in a universe of perfect splendour which begins to deteriorate only after 1,728,000 years. In ANCIENT CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY , Dr. Charles Muses wrote on the origin of certain Babylonian numbers. He noticed embedded in cosmic structure certai n deeply fundamental numbers, which constitute an \"alphabet\" of sacred numbers. Among those still used today are 360 degrees of a circle; 60 minutes for an hour; 60 seconds for a minute and 24 hours for a day; 7 days a week; 12 months a year. Muses makes a list of 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 24, 60, and 360. He proceeds to show how all these numbers are related to patterns of circular arrangement. Twofold twelveness, or 24 comes from uniting the 12 signs of the Zodiac with 12 hours of the day. Thus, from 360, 60 and 24 came a circle of time of 24 x 60 x 60 or 86,400 seconds. And a circle for space of 360 x 60 x 60 or 1,296,000 seconds. Another research project of mathematician Dr. Muses is even more stunning in its r esults. He discovered that the roots an ancient Tantric lunar meditation practices were timed to certain anomolies in the moon's orbit. The Satapatha Brahmana and the Taittireya Sanhita recount the proceedures for a Tantric Lunar Resonance Meditation, associated with the Indo-European soma saccrifice. They are linked to the phases of the moon, but not the obvious points. The practice specifically divided the lunar month into 9 special days in both the waxing and waning halves, a cycle composed of 18 days total."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"There is a striking correspondence between the two-fold cycle of lunar phase s (9 + 9 = 18) each month and the hypernumber w , a lunar elliptic orbit function developed by NASA for the space program. This hypernumber w and it's phases of the elliptical orbits provide the only availa ble mathematical paradigm corresponding to the anomolies distinct to the waxing and waning lunar fortnights. It is amazing that they could be known through some unknown form of calculation in pre-Vedic times. It is not necessary to describe the source and functions of hypernumbers here. It is enought to know that the hypernumber w has the remarkable property that, when multiplied successively by itself, all the resulting numbers lie on a cert ain ellipse. The number resulting from multiplying the square root of w successively by itself also lie on the very same ellipse. Exactly 12 distinct points are generated by both these proce sses. There are three principle irregularities in the lunar orbit known since Ptol emy of Alexandria, but this cannot be the Vedic source, since it came later. Together the se irregularities furnish a set of eight places in the lunar orbit where these reflecting configurations of force are maximum. These eight places map on the eight poi nts furnished by the integer powers of the hypernumber w. W was conceived by 20th century mathematicians to describe these irregulartities of the lunar orbit. In ancient Indo-Iranian tradition the holiest time of the month is the dark of the moon, where it is conjoined by the sun itself. The sun travels through the celestial sphere of 360 degrees. Multiples of 360 reveal a cascade of ancient sacred numbers, which are instrumental in the arith metical construction of Divine Ages of the Hindus. 1 x 360 = 360 2 x 360 = 720 3 x 360 = 1080 - OM 4 x 360 = 1440 5 x 360 = 1800 - half circle 6 x 360 = 2160; age of years 7 x 360 = 2520; Auric Key 8 x 360 = 2880 9 x 360 = 3240; x 2 sum of ages 6480 10 x 360 = 3600; Sumerian sar 11 x 360 = 3960 12 x 360 = 4320 Maha Yuga div by 4 = 1080 x 2 = 8640 (4320 + 6480) Yugas + Ages Hindu cosmology mixed time-space concepts derived from solar and lunar cal endars with holy number words.

OM or AUM is the Word of the creator of universe, Brahman, who is associated with number 43200. This notion is fundamental in two Hindu astro-calendaric systems, t he Ages and the Yugas , which delineate the number of divine years in different Epochs.

This center concept is the root notion behind the mandala, a term which itself means \"a circle.\" Like our Synchrographs, the mandala represents a whole series of circles , concentric or otherwise, inscribed within a square. It is a symbol of the rite of penetratio n, which places the neophyte in a sort of labyrinth as an initiatory process. Mandalas clearl y have a labyrinthine character, and so do mandalogs if viewed from that perspective. They help us to concentrate and find our own center in the microcosm. This can lead directly to a more authentic and deeper personal experience and understanding, if traditional ritual has become fossilized; the need of a personal"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"experience is for reactivating certain primordial symbols in our consciousness . The purely mental constructions act as a support for meditation. The Hindu notion of deep time is revealed when Indra hears from the mouth of Vishnu the true story of the eternal creation and destruction of worlds, the Great Time , mythic time in which we find the true source of all beings and of all cosmic events. This helps us pierce the veil of illusion created by profane time and our own history, and like Indr a cures us of our pride and ignorance. It is a redemptive function. To transcend profane time and re-enter into mythical Great Time is equivalent to a revelation of ultimate reality--the reality which is strictly meta physical, and can be approached in no other way than through myths and symbols. The conception of cyclic and infinite Time, Presented by Vishnu is the general Indian conception of cosmic cycles. Though this belief is found in all archaic societies , it is first espoused in the Atharva Veda. India elaborated the doctrine of cosmic cycles by amplifying the number of pe riodic creations and destructions of the Universe to ever more terrifying proporti ons. The transition of each age marks the beginning of a regression. The decreasing leng th of each yuga marks this durational degeneration toward the present Kali Yuga . It is so called for the \"black\" goddess Kali or ( Shakti , the Great Goddess), whose name is akin to the Sanskrit kala , or \"time.\" She is the personification of time. Number 108 is also said to be the number of names of the great Mother Goddess. The 12,000 years of one mahayuga has been counted as \"divine years\" of 360 each, which gives a total of 4,320,000 years for a single cosmic cycle. This is all we need to retain with the cyclic character of cosmic time. The life of Brahma com prises 2,560,000 of these mahayugas , each going through the same stages concluding with a pralaya , and grand dissolution. THE HINDU CONCEPT OF NUMBER Indian Philosophy, Cosmology, and Science \"The Hindu traditions were brought to the Indian subcontinent by 'Aryan ' migrants from the shores of the Caspian Sea, cousins of the Indo-Europeans who were the Hittites of Asia Minor (today's Turkey) and of the Hurrians of th e upper Euphrates River, through whom Sumerian knowledge and beliefs were transmitted to the Indo-Europeans. The Aryan migrations are believed to have taken place in the 2nd millenium BC and the Vedas were held to be 'not of human origin,' having been composed by the gods themselves in a previous age. In time the various components of the Vedas and the auxilliary literature t hat derived from them (the Mantras, Brahmanas, etc.) were augmented by the non- Vedic Puranas, and the great epic tales of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. In"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"them, ages deriving from multiples of 3600 also predominate, [and the Divine Cycle of 432,000].\" Zecharia Sitchen, When Time Began In the Bronze Age, the Indus Valley of Pakistan and Northwestern India was one of t he cradles of civilization. Their lost language was proto-Dravidian. The Vedas were written in the Indo-European predecessor of the Indian root-tongue Sanskrit. The two main cities were Mohenjo-Daro in Sind, and Harappa in the Punjab. Its original civilization, the Harappan, emerged about 2500 B.C. This was a sophisticated urban society with pictographic systems of writing and measurement ( metrology ). A thousand years later, Aryans brought cultural influences from the north with rituals tha t formed the foundation of Hinduism. These traditions apparently included number mysticism, but one of astronomical numbers, not integers.. Beginning with the Brahmanas , and even the Puranas , the Indians developed the doctrine of the four Yugas, the four Ages of the World. The essence of this theory is the cyclical creation and destruction of the World and the belief in \"the perfection of the beginnings.\" As the Buddhists and Jains hold the same views, this doctrine of the ete rnal creation and destruction of the Universe is a pan-Indian idea. In Indian cosmogony, the complete cycle is terminated by a dissolution ( pralaya ), with a great dissolution ( mahapralaya ) at the end of the thousandth cycle. The names of the four Yugas first appear in the Aitareya Brahmana, VII, 14 . In India, time is not a measure of quantity, but a means of expressing universal relationshi ps. This doctrine of ages is a variation on the Myth of the Eternal Return, a primal conception of periodic renewal of the World. In Hinduism, man plays no part in this re-creation, but desires to escape from the cosmic cycle. There is no final End of the World, just intervening annihilations of one Universe and the appearance of others. In every age there is a turning-point, a new way of seeing and asserting the coherence of the world. Each culture tries to fix its visionary moment, when it was transforme d by a new conception either of nature or man. When seeking the roots of ancient sciences, it is important to remember that a la nguage system may persist in the religious or sacred arena long after it is superce ded by a more popular dialect. This has been the fate of Sumerian (which ceased to be spoken around 2000 BC), but was the language of sacred liturgy and divine knowledge for fifteen more centuries. Other liturgical languages with a similar destiny include Sanskrit, Hebre w, and Latin, (as well as Old Slavic). The Akkadians preserved old Sumerian religious structure of a supreme Triad, and this reflected into India as Brahma/Vishnu/Shiva and the west as the Trinity."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Akkadians promoted the Sun god over the Supreme Triad, and the Triad gradually lost cult supremacy to the sun as unrivaled universal divinity whose primary quality i s the emanation of numinous light. Another creation of Akkadian religious thought is divination. They multiplied magical practices and developed occult disciplines including astrology, which later be came popular throughout the Asiatic and Mediterranean world. They added the personal experience to religious life and exalted certain divinities to supreme rank. Astrology, a late development, was originally practiced primarily by the r oyal entourage. Over time, the ideas, beliefs and other techniques of Mesopotamian origin circula ted from the western Mediterranean to the Hindu Kush. The Mesopotamian discoveries always emphasized a direct correspondence between heaven and earth, or macrocos m and microcosm. Contact with Sumerian culture mutated other civilizations, including the Egyptian. The first cities of India, the indigenous Harappan civilization, were overrun by the Aryan warlords, who deplored writing and had no cities of their own. Their characterist ic feature, before they settled down, was oral tradition, since after their encount er with the Near Eastern civilizations, they prohibited using writing. This mixing of cultures led to a religious syncretism or mixing of the mental conc epts of both groups, which very shortly spread Hinduism through the subcontinent. The Harappan religion provided the prototype of the Mother Goddess and her consort, the phallic Shiva ( Shiva/Shakti ). They echo Mesopotamian mythology. Around 1750 BC, the Indus civilization was on its deathbed, and the Indo-Aryans gave it a mortal blow. But this happened progressively, over centuries of intermingling. Aryanization of the Punjab launched the movement of the synthesis that became Hinduism. In the west, the Hellenic culture and religion was the result of the symbiosis be tween the Mediterranean substratum and the Indo-European conquerers from the north. Then Hellenism sent its roots into Egypt and Asia on the tide of Mycenaean conquerors. Despite symbiosis with countless pre-Hellenic traditions, the Aryan-speaki ng conquerors succeeded in imposing their pantheon and in maintaining their specific religious s tyle. The original home of the Indo-Europeans is the region north of the Black Sea between the Carpathians and the Caucasus. The Indo-Europeans had elaborated a specific mythology and theology (pantheon headed by a storm god and Mother Goddess). They practiced sacrifices and knew the magi co- religious value of the Word and of chanting. They possessed concepts of rituals that enabled them to consecrate space to \"cos micize\" the territories in which they settled, and enabled them to \"periodically ren ew the world.\" 10800 bricks in the fire altar = recreating universe in a ritual imitation of cre ation."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Indo-European tribes called themselves Aryan, \"noble man.\" They progressi vely assimilated the survivors of the Dravidian Indus civilization, as shown by language. Vedic Sanskrit has a series of phonemes, especially the cerebral consonants , which are found in no other Indo-European idiom, not even in Iranian. Very probably these consonants reflect the pronunciation of the aborigines trying to learn the language of thei r masters. Similarly, the Vedic vocabulary preserves a large number of non-Arya n words. The time of the Asuras preceded the present epoch, ruled by the Devas. In India as in a number of archaic and traditional religions, the passage from a primordial epoch to the present epoch is expressed in cosmogonic terms: passage from a state of chaos to an organized world, a cosmos. The agnicayana ritual was an imitation of the creation which sacralized a locality, making it the local center of the universe. The altar was built with 10,800 bric ks piled up in five courses, sometimes taking the form of a bird, symbolizin g the sacrificer's mystical ascent to heaven. Originally, it involved human sacrifice, repeating the self-sacrifice of Prajapati. The building of the altar symbolized the creation of the universe, which consecrates any land. The cosmologies, like so many other religious ideas and beliefs, represent a heri tage transmitted from prehistory everywhere in the ancient world. The Indians reva lorized and reinterpreted many cosmogonic myths. In the most famous hymn of the Rig Veda , the cosmogony is presented as a metaphysics, revealing how Being came out of Non-being. There was an undifferentiated princ iple called \"One\" (neuter): \" The One breathed from its own i mpulse, without there being any breath .\" Aside from that \"nothing else existed.\" Heat gave birth to the \"One\" potential and this potential developed desire which bec ame Consciousness. The first seed then divided itself into genders, and the gods were born afterwards. The \"One\" transcended both Gods and Creation. The One precedes the universe and creates the world by emanation from his own being. Both consciousness and the universe are the product of procreative desire . The Rig Veda's notion of the \"One\" is continued in the identity of Purusha/Prajapati . In the beginning Prajapati was the nonmanifested Unity- Totality. The triple identification of Prajapati with the universe, with cyclic time (the year) and with the fire altar constitutes the great novelty of the Brahmanic theory of s acrifice. They contain the thought that the world and life exhaust themselves by their very duration. Satapatha Brahmana states that, \" This Prajapati, the Year, is made up of 720 days and nights; that is why the altar comprises 360 enclosing stones and 360 bricks. \" In short, every sacrifice repeats the primodial act of creation and guarante es the continuity of the world for the following year."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"In the Brahmanas , sacrifice recreates the cosmos that has been exhausted by cyclic time (the year). This later becomes the conceptual basis of creating the atman , or indestructible spiritual being. The self ( atman ) is equated with Brahman. The Brahman knows the structure and origin of the universe, because he knows the Word that expresses all that; f or Vac , the Logos, can transform any person into a Brahman. The identity atman-Brahman leads to the experience of \"inner light.\" This spiritual exercise reflects the Vedic tradition that the sun and light are regarded a s epiphanies of Being, of Spirit, of immortality and procreation. According to the Rig Veda 1.115.1, the sun is the life or atman--the Self--of all things. The atman is a form of \"li ght in the heart.\" That Immortal, fearless being is atman. That is Brahman. The identity brahman-atman constitutes the most important discovery of the Upanishads. The MAHABHARATA , with 90,000 verses is the longest epic in world history. It recounts the conflict between two lines of Bharatas. By the fifth book of the series, they are preparing for battle, which is recounted in the sixth book--the Bhagavad Gita. This monstrous war was decided upon by Brahma, to relieve the earth of a population that did not cease to multiply. Therefore, Brahma convinced a certain number of gods and demons to become incarnate in order to provoke a terrifying war of extermination. Thus, the MAHABHARATA describes the end of a world ( pralaya) , followed by the emergence of a new world. The poem has an eschatological structure reveal ing a gigantic battle between good and evil. There is destruction on a cosmic scale followed by t he resurgence of a new and pure world. It is the conclusion of a cosmic age. The cyclical theory was popular from the earliest times of the Puranas . The eschatological myth is older than Hinduism; it is archaic and widely dissemi nated among crossroad cultures. The myth of the end of the world was known by the Indo-Europeans. Even though the eschatological myth is not documented in the Vedic period, this doesn't prove that it did not exist. The Mahabharata contains Vedic and pre-Vedic notions. It is an epic transposition of an eschatological crisis, which Hindu mythology called the end of a yuga. It is a grandiose synthesis, much richer than the Indo-European prototy pe. In this cycle of the eternal return, Krishna reveals himself to Arjuna as an inca rnation of Vishnu. Vishnu is the author of catastrophic destructions and resurrections. This is as much to s ay that Vishnu, as a supreme being, is the ultimate reality. He governs both the cre ation and destruction of worlds. He is beyond good and evil, like all the gods. But the poem also glorifies the complementarity of Shiva and Vishnu , the Aryan/Harappan synthesis. These gods, together with the Great Goddess ( Shakti, Kali, Durga) have dominated Hinduism from the first centuries of our era to the present. Understanding the creative/destructive aspect of divinity is equivalent to a revelation and also constitutes a model to follow in obtaining deliverance."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Deliverance involves comprehension of the relations between the two m odes of the real: immediate--that is, historically conditioned--reality and ultim ate reality. Curiously, this paradoxical work about a frightening war of extermination and the end of a yuga is the exemplary model for every spiritual synthesis achieved in Hinduism, especially the tendency to reconcile contraries. It justifies a cert ain mode of existing in time; it valorizes the historicity of the human condition. Arjuna's existentia l crisis ends with his exemplary revelation concerning the human condition and the \"ways\" of deliverance. Like the Greeks and the Jews, the Hindus faced the dilemma of time's meaning: In the History of Religious Ideas , Eliade puts it succinctly: \"How is it possible to resolve the paradoxical situation created by the twofold fact th at man, on the one hand, finds himself existing in time, condemned to history, and, on th e other hand, know that he will be 'damned\" if he allows himself to be exhausted by temporality and by his own historicity, and that consequently, he must at all costs find in the world a way that leads to a transhistorical and atemporal plane.\" Since the whole univese is the creation, (or even the epiphany of Krishna-Vishnu) , to live in the world, to participate in its structures, does not constitute an evil act. The \"evil act\" is to believe that the world and time and history posses an indep endent reality of their own, that is, to believe that nothing else exists outside of the world and temporality. The idea is certainly pan-Indian, but it is in the Bhagavad Gita that it received its most consistent expression. It is still Vishnu who periodically destroys the universe, at the end of each cos mic cycle. All is created and governed by God. Cosmic life, individual existence and history receive a religious meaning. The periodic destruction of the universe is a theophany...the resacralization of life and human existence. In Hinduism, man plays no part in this re-creation, but desires to escap e from the cosmic cycle. There is no final End of the World, just intervening annihi lations of one Universe and the appearance of others. In every age there is a turning-point, a new way of seeing and asserting the coherence of the world. Each culture tries to fix its visionary moment, wh en it was transformed by a new conception either of nature or man. Hindi Baseten Numerals The history of our base ten system emerges from this Hindu cosmogony and astronomy. Hindi-Arabic numerals penetrated into Europe beginning in t he 12th Century. A unique property of Hindu numerals is that (unlike Hebrew , Greek, Roman, Mayan, Chinese, or other characters) the numerals are REVERSABLE an d hold place value."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Without resorting to graphic depiction to reveal inherent symmetry and rhyth ms, they allow for the symbolic representation of palindromes and transpalin dromes, the emergence of classes of numbers. This is a singular property of this base ten system of notation, even though the Hindus were influenced by Hellenistic culture as well. Greece and the Near Ea st still employed alphabetic numerals, with no place values. With the advent of positional numeration and its universal acceptance, the decimal cryptogram of a number automaticall y provided it with a name. According to the Hindu view, all the aspects of the manifest world spring from sim ilar principles. There is a correspondence or equivalence between sounds, forms, numbers, colors, ideals, as there is also between the abstractions of subtle and metaphy sical worlds on one side and the forms of the perceptible universe on the other. Astronomical phenomena form the basic symbols of universal principles. According to the Nondual Principle, the Supreme Cause must be beyond Number, otherwise Number would be the First Cause. But one is considered a nu mber just like two, or three, or ten, or a million. If \"God\" is one, he is not beyond number any more than if he is two, three, or a million. But, although a million is not any ne arer to infinity than any number, it seems to be so. The number one is in a way the number farthest removed from infinity, so divinity is best represe nted by an immense number of different gods. In the Puranas , it says, \"The nature of illusion (maya) is [represented by] the number one.\" To speak of the manifest force of a unique God implies a confusion between different orders. God manifest cannot be one, nor can the number one apply to an unmanifest causal aspect. At no stage can unity be taken as the cause of anything, since the existence implies a relation and unity would mean existence without relation. Divinity as ultimate essence, is neither one, nor two (dual), nor many. The nondual principle transcends all forms of manifest divinity. This nondual Immensity is t he Brahman, on a plane different from that of existence. Existence is multiplici ty. The identity of the macrocosm and microcosm can be observed in the permanence of the relations found as the substratum of all the aspects of the perceptible universe. Thes e relations can best be expressed in terms of number. Hence NUMBER is easily s een as the common element of all forms, the all-pervading unity of all substance. Modern physi cs reflects and confirms this philosophy. The creative or revealed Word of Brahm in the Vedas is AUM , or OM . It is the first manifestation of articulate language, the root monosyllable, which includes al l language and meaning. It is the seed syllable of all human speech, a nutshell containing the w hole of wisdom. The four Vedas are merely comments on and amplifications of this infint ely meaningful syllable. It is more than past, present, and future; it is an indestructibl e Immensity"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"AUM is said to issue through a process of MULTIFOLD REFLECTION. Taken as a symbol of divinity, AUM appears as the form from which the universe develops; the first thought-form of Brahman, the Creator. From this basic syll able spring forth all the elemental sounds, the roots of manifestation, keys of all language. The number 4,320,000 (108 x 40) has a very ancient symbolic or \"divine\" meaning. It came to India with the Aryan migration and became codified in the Rigveda, Book of Sacred Verses . Among other things, it is the number of syllables in the Rigveda , which has 40 syllables per stanza, (10800 stanzas x 40 syllables = 432,000). Hindu tradition associated the \"divine\" number 432,000 with the Brahman and the Yugas and Ages. This number of the catayuga divided by four yields ages of diminishing length.

These are divine, not human years...the corresponding duration for the Kali Yuga is 36,000 mortal years. 32 x 12. Indian Science and Cosmology The Golden Age of Indian science came to medieval India during the Gupta Empire (320- 647 AD) when culture and the arts flourished. The most famous scientist of the period was the astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata. He discussed, in verse, quadratic equations, sinces, the value of pi, eclipses, solstices, and equinoxes, and the spherical shape of the earth, and its daily revolution on its axis. His successor, Brahmagupta , systematized the astronomic knowledge of India. Other Indian astronomers made up a calendar of 12 month, each of 30 days, each day of 30 hours, inserting an intercalary month every five years. The Buddhists still use a lunar calendar. They also predicted eclipses accurately, calculated the moon' s diameter, and expounded the theory of gravity. Indian astronomy and mathematics were unequaled (except in geometry) by those of any ancient western people. Our Arabic numerals and decimal system which come from them are far more fluid and versatile than any before them. The numerals can be found on the rock edicts of Asoka (256 BC), while the scientists used the decimals system long before the Arbs, Syrians, and Chinese had a chance to borrow them. The mathematicians also created the concept of a negative quantity (without which algebra could not exist) , and found the square root of 2, and solved complicated equations. The discovery sometime in the first centuries of our era of the Princi ple of Position became a world-wide event. It was a radical departure in method, which in S yndex"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Theory makes reciprocity possible. Without this principle of position no progress in arithmetic was possible. Place position probably was inspired by the use of counting boards. ZERO was probably conceived this way also from an empty column, and became the Indian SUNYA . It reprents a turning point for modern science, industry, and commerce. It paved the way t o a generalized number concept, and plays a fundamental role in nearly every branch of mathematics. It is one of the single greatest achievements of human thought . There is an ancient code of numbers and proportion based on metrological standards of measure. Such constants as astronomical Precession, and geodet ic measures such as polar diameter provided the basic context. Fractions of the earth's principle dimensions mirrored numerical patterns in the appearanc e and movement of nature. These numbers are the vestiges of the Sumerian sexagesimal system and calendar. Earlier measures of astronomy, astrology, and cosmology were usually in units of 12, as were various ancient units of measurement of time. Mankind counted days and the changing of the moon and seasons for millennia before recorded history. As early as 3760 BC, the Sumerians created a lunar calendar. B y 2800 B.C., they had worked our a cycle of 19 years which kept it synchronized with the solar year and seasons. Certain years had 12 lunar months, while others had thirteen. This lunar calendar was adapted by the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Greeks and Jews . The Nippur calendar is still the basis of Jewish religious ceremonies. Sumerian astronomy included the concept of \"deep time,\" as recounted i n the Enuma Elish, the Epic of Creation . Ancient texts known as the Sumerian King Lists describe the settling of the divine Anunnaki on Earth before the del uge. They list the governorships of the first 10 leaders which lasted a total of 120 sars , or 432,000 Earth-years. This is a direct source for divine eras in Hindu lore, but they expand th e vastness to an overall time span of 4,320,000, and then to a Divine Year or Day of Lord Brahma--4,320,000,000--a thousandfold great yugas. The Sumerian formula is echoed in the Hindu traditions. From Sumeria comes the ubiquitous concept of a sky divided into 360 degr ees of Latitude, 60 minutes of 3600 seconds; 12 month years beginning on Spring Equinox; 12 hours of day and night (2x12=24); 12 signs of the Zodiac, etc. Sumerian fractions were geared to the principle of repeated halving. Whole unit or natural fractions are important in arranging metrological units. The syst em based on 60 is evenly divisibly by 2,3,4,5,6,10,15, and 30 eliminating the frequent need of fractions. This naturally leads to grouping higher units in 12, 30, or 60. All these ratios occur in one or another of the parallel systems of units in Mesopotamian metrology. 4320 is one suc h number; so is 108000."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Greek astronomers adopted this system, and so did their followers i n India, the Islamic Empire, and Europe. Much of the mathematical knowledge commonly ascribed to the early Greek philosophers was already known to the Egyptians an d Mesopotamians centuries before the rise of Greek civilization.

They were the first to consider mathematical concepts as abstractions not part of the real world, but of the idealized \"sac red space\" of the human mind. There is some evidence of ancient India having direct contact with Sumeria ar ound 2500 B.C. This is difficult to document, but not to deduce. However, nevertheless, Hindus contributed the final step to mathematical astronomy, namely, the use of the plac e value notation for the smaller decimal units.

THE SURYA SIDDHANTA THE CLASSIC OF INDIAN ASTRONOMY \"The time by which the worlds come to an end is different from the time w hich measures life. Time is thus of two kinds, gross and subtle, manifest and unmanifest.\" Surya Siddhanta 1.10 [371] The worship of the sun was common in antiquity and India was no exception. There is a famous sun temple in Konark in South India, and in the historic town of Mooltan or the land of the Sun, in the North. The sacred wordnumber 108 had to do with the numbers of revolutions of the sun in the various epochs, which are all multi ples of #108 . The Holotomic Sequence was discovered through a systematic graphic analysis of the enspiralment of number 108 (or 3 x 36). Not only sacred to the Hindus, this number also appears in Tibetan Buddhism, where it is considered highly auspicious, being the number of beads on each strand of the malla, or Tibetan rosary beads. Therefore, it reveals its character as an anci ent symbolic form of circular unity. The Hindu calendar claims an amazing antiquity. Its alleged starting point i s the divine beginning of Brahman, the first god of the Holy Triad Brahman/Vishnu/Shiva. Its unit is the Kalpa , equivalent to one day of Brahma's life (4,320,000,000 years--a close estimate to the age of the Solar System). Brahma's alloted life span is 100 years of 365 Kalpas each. The present epoch is the Kali Yuga and this Hindu year exceeds the figure 155,521,972,849,000 and counting. In both solar and lunar calculations, the ancient Hindus fixed certain points of time back as epochs. They each begin when the planets are assumed to fall into a line of mean conjunction with the Sun in the beginning of Aries. In the classic astronomical text , the Surya Siddhanta (400 A.D.), the zodiacal signs are used to denote arcs on any great circle. In the Surya Siddhanta , the least cycle of years in which the Sun, Moon, and planets are supposed to return to a line of mean conjunction at the beginning of Aries is 1080,000 years, a fourth of a Maha Yuga of 4,320,000,000 years or revolutions of the Sun ( Surya ). The revolutions given in the Surya Siddhanta must always be divisible by four, or no mean conjunction could take place at the beginning of the Kali Yuga."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"There are two primary astrocalendaric systems in India, solar and lunar: Yugas and Ages denoted by metals: According to Neugebauer (1952), the sixth chapter of the Surya Siddhanta deals with a graphical representaion of the different phases of an eclipse; the thirteenth c hapter deals with the construction of a celestial globe. These mysteries were reserved for initiates: \" This mystery of the gods is not to be imparted indiscriminately: it is to be made kn own to the welltried pupil, who remains a year under instruction.\" Spherical astronomy methods are characterized by the use of the interior of a sphere for determining the length of circular arcs on the sphere. This method was used in the Surya Siddhanta to determine the length of daylight from the shadow of a sundial of known height. Another astronomical text, the Panca Siddhanta (505 A.D.), written by Varaha Mihiri is a summary of five great classical astronomical treatises. It r eveals a close relationship in methods of calculation to the Babylonian linear (arithmetic) method. This met hod of determining the position of the sun works with zigzag functions or step functions which approximate greatest and smallest solar velocity. There is no direct evide nce for a direct link from Babylon to India, but it cannot be ruled out. However, the Hellenistic influences in the texts are obvious to scholars. Despite its origin, the apparently Babylonian knowledge was passed back to Asia Minor in an improved form by al-Biruni, who reported on Hindu astronomy and astrology in 1030 A.D. The Panca Siddhanta also contained rules for computing lunar motion based on processes now known to us from Greek sources. But the Surya Siddhanta arguably remained the main canon of Hindu astronomy. It was allegedly revealed by the Sun (Surya) at the end of the Golden Age (2163102 B.C.) to a Maya Asura. Its contents, however, reflect the Hellenistic influence. While the original may be dated to 400 A.D., the consistently-modified present version may have been written as late as 1000 A.D., long after the conquests of Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.), and his death in Babylon. From that point forward, Hellenistic a nd Mesopotamian sources are definitely mixed. The terminology and methods of Hindu astrology are certainly of Greek origin. For example, the names of the zodiacal signs are Greek loan-words. Similarly, the basic concepts of the planetary theory of the Surya Siddhanta are influenced by the Greek epicyclic models and not by Babylonian linear methods. In the chronology of Hindu astronomy, linear methods as well as trigonometric models point to the early centuries AD, not BC. Babylonian methods and concepts reached India either via Persia or Roman/Greek sea routes to Pondicherry where these me thods first surface in the subcontinent. They appear only in the form of Hellenistic astronomy and astrology."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Surya Siddhanta combines older, very primitive sections with the Greek theory of epicyclic motion. But even though this Greek influence is apparent, it has obviously undergone a quite independent transformation in many details of the general theor y. Modifications of certain types, such as the values of numerical constants, we nt on almost continuously. They moved closer into accord with the Hellenistic sources. The time of the Surya Siddhanta's origin and this cultural contact is the same--about 400 AD. The source book of the Panca Siddhanta is the Paulisa Siddhanta which contained the earliest documented sources on place value notation. Hindu astronomy re flects here the oldest strata of Greek astronomy, without Ptolemaic theory's ref inements, (150 BC-150AD). Latin translations of the astronomical tables of Al-Khwarizmi are a curious mixture of the Hindu and Greek methods. He translated SLOKAS , or Hindu sacred verses, for the west. Another Arab scholar, Al-Biruni translated an astrological work of Varaha M ihiri's into Arabic. According to Neugebauer: \"There are many evident indications of a direct contact of Hindu astronomy wit h Hellenistic tradition, e.g. the use of epicycles or the use of tables of chords w hich were transformed by the Hindus into tables of sines. The same mixture of ecli ptic arcs and declination circles is found with Hipparchus and in the early Siddhantas , [where they referred to polar longitude and polar latitude] .\" The extensive use of the sexagesimal system is common in both Greek and Mesopotamian astronomy. \"Indian asterisms appear in Abu Ma'shar, and their source is found in the astrological writings of varaha Mihira, the same author of the sixth century AD in whose astronomical work we found the use of the linear methods for the lunar motion, otherwise known to us from Greek papyri and finally from cuneiform tablets. Following the unmistakable traces of very specific astrological doctrines, one can reconstruct the road which connected Hellenistic Mesopotamia with Hellenistic Egypt, with pre-Islami c Persia, and with India.\" The lunar theory presented in the Panca Siddhanta is essentially the same step functions described in Babylonian texts. In the Surya Siddhanta , the zodiacal signs are used to denote arcs on any great cicle, as did the Greek Hipparchus. In the Surya Siddhanta , lunar months are described of fixed length, but later in Hindu astronomy they are of variable length as in the adjusted lunar calendar. Decimal place value notation probably wa s a modification of the sexagesimal place value notation with which the Hindus became familiar through Hellenistic astronomy. So, it appears that even in the ancient world, \"there is not much new under the sun.\" Concepts travelled along cultural exchange routes, and were widely shared and m odified, then recycled back to where they came from...in the so-called beginning.

The Aryan, or pre-Vedic Puranas derived ages from multiples of 3,600: 3600 x 3600 = 12,960,000.

Now one Brahma year is reckoned as 360 Brahma days and nights, each night and each day consisting of 12,000,000 divine years. But each divine year, in turn, consists of 360 human years; so that one full day and night of Brahma, or 24,000,000 divine years, contains 24,000,000 times 360 or 8,640,000,000 human years, just as in our own system of reckoning the 24 hours of a day contain 86,400 seconds--each second corresponding to the length of time, furthermore, of one heartbeat of a human body in perfect physical condition. Thus it appears not only that the temporal order written on the faces of our clocks is the same as that of the Indian god Vishnu's dream, but also that there is built into this system the mythological concept of a correspondence between the organic rhythms of the human body as a microcosm and the cycling eons of the universe, the macrocosm.\" Joseph Campbell, The Mythic Image Hindu polytheism implies many discrete points of view.

Graphic displays can reveal certain features of number behavior which remain hi dden in numerical or linguistic terms. The neighborhood of special numbers can be reveal ed by certain spiralic displays of circular unity (mandalogs). #108 as the Hindu number of the Universe is one such circular totality whi ch encodes the structure of Epochs or Divine Ages. Since the incremental numbers of the ages are multiples of #108, when enspiralled along 108 axes, the characters 0 - 6480 all align along the zero/108 axis -- they share the same neighborhood. The synchrographic structure of the two ancient Hindu modules of circu lar unity disclose that the Yugas fall into a perfect tertiary symmetry. The Ages assume a perfect quadric symmetry when spiralled along 108 axes of a number field, arr ay, or matrix. The final number of this synchrograph is 6480. The number of zeros at t he end of any astronomical Hindu number is nearly arbitrary. The glyph unifie s the two ancient systems. These high factorial number arrays preceeded modern forms of circular unity, e ven perhaps the Babylonian adoption of 360 as circular unity in that 108 is 3 x 36. The number wheel, Synchrograph C #108, enspirals the natural number series around a field divided into 108 radial increments from zero to 6480. Since #108 is 3 x 36, and both systems mutually include the square of 36 (1296), it becomes evident that the classic 360 degree circular unity is the common denominator of these two separate systems. \" The word OM,\" said Ramakrishna to his friends, \"is Brahman. Following the trail of OM, one attains Brahmin.\" The vowel O in Sanskrit is regarded as a fusion of A and U. Note also that the numbers that represent these two systems all fall i n the same zero axis. Also note, the sum of the Yugas (4320) end at two thirds of this axis (6480 - 3 = 2160: Platonic month = 12 x 2160 = 25920, Precessional numbers). In the configuration of this mandalog, the four-digit palindromic sequenc e \"1881, 2772, 3663, 4554, 5445,\" etc. fall in a quadric array, and the turnaround or nave of transpalindromicity (49.5) synchronizes the corner of the square with th e side of the triangle, i.e. the nave between 45 and 54 (which added together equals 99).

As we have seen elsewhere, these are closely related t o the Holotomic Sequence, which has its nave in the perfect number 6. 12 - 24 - 72 - 360 - 2520, etc. are all key numbers in the Sumerians so-called sexagesimal system. It was not beyond the Sumerians to determine their fac tors of divisibility even when they had no concept of the unique properties of pr ime numbers. SIX, not sixty, is the key to the original system, which much later influenc ed the development of Hindu numerals and Divine Ages. There was a decimal subte xt to the original Sumerian sexagesimal system. Numeronomy is naturally based on six, not sixty. The assumption of sixty as the number on which the Sumerians based their system of calculation creat es a difficulty in seeing how the number six, by itself, gives the foundation for the synchronization of number and geometry. Six as the first perfect number denotes circular unity in planal geome try and accomodates Synergetics requirements for wholeness. By doubling six, w e involve spherical unity represented by the close pack of 12 spheres around one. The number 60 shows no such harmony. Symmetry and synchronicity of planal and spatial systems of geometry and number share a basic unified interface. 60 is not a Holotome, and does not represent a symmetrical retrograde unity when mapped out in the synchrographic discipline. It does however contain a unique nature in that it is the lowest number to accomodate 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. ITS MISSING DIVISORS, FIVE AND SEVEN are conspicuously absent in either the Yugas or Ages. NO FIVES EXIST IN THE YUGAS; NO SEVENS OR THREE EXISTS IN THE AGES. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are the first primes.

THE SUMERIAN LEGACY The Sumerian legacy is an integral aspect of Synchrographics. Historically , the first synchrograph could be considered their division of the sky into the 12 divisions of the Zodiac. Zecharia Sitchin concludes that Sumerian science originated with the \"gods f rom outer space.\" But it is not as mind-bending to imagine some more plausible alternat ives to this \"channelling.\" An ancient \"Newton,\" \"Leonardo,\" or \"Einstein\" could have bootstrapped his mathematical system from ages of pre-historical experience, 50,000 ye ars of human observation of the heavens and earth. Just like the nameless creator of the Phoenician alphabet, the name of the source w as lost, but the useful knowledged retained. Steeped in legend and myth by Babylonian times it was attributed to a divine source just as we attribute our own moments of inspiration or genius to a higher source, beyond our ordinary selves. This nameless genius created a n oral tradition whose tables and methods were eventually written down. At first, one ha d to be an initiate (priest or scribe) to use the methods. Later they were adopted in e veryday life. The ancient systematic observers noticed the regularity of the passages of the planets through the constellations of the fixed stars. They conceived the grandiose idea of a mathematically determined cosmic order of greatness with lesser e ver-evolving cycles of celestial manifestation, disappearance and renewal. Man sought then to harmoniz e with these cycles through the timing of religious festivals and astronomically b ased calendars in imitation of heavenly circumstances. The Precession of the Equinoxes was first noticed as a slow but steady s lippage through the Zodiac of 1 degree every 72 years. To complete one cycle of the zodiac -- a \"Great\" or Platonic Year--requires 25,920 years. Dividing this sum by 360 yields the number 432, the root of the mythological count of 432,000 years. However, it is not only mythological, or archetypal--it was discovered by centuries of controlle d astronomical observation, even prior to written record-keeping. In India, the Kali Yuga is supposed to have begun on February 17, 3102 BC. The astronomical aspect of a yuga begins with the sun, moon, and planets in conjunction in the initial point of the ecliptic. Everything returns to the same point at the end of the age."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"This belief originated way before Hindu astronomy and is cross-cultural. But 3102 BC is a good approximation of the invention of the arts of writing, mathematics, and astronomy--all of which are a remarkable effort at translating cel estial mathematics into the ordering principle of life on earth. This is the echo of the old Mesopotamian doctrine which reverberated through Greece and Rome (Berossos to Seneca) as well as India ( Yugas ). It spread all over the known world into Egypt, the Zoroastrians, and traces are even found in China, Mexico, and South America. The old Sumerian tradition of astronomical observation was the basis of all intellectual culture, and originator of the myths of eschatology, or end ti mes. The Sacred Portal The sacred place, the center of transformation, has always been a refuge f rom the laws of the temporal world. Sacred space is the visionary gateway which opens communicat ion with the transcendental reality of the divine. Here, as Jung states, \"man is n o longer a distinct individual but his mind widens out and merges into the mind of mankind--not the conscious mind, but the nconscious mind of mankind, where we are all the same. When the concept of such a holy site or center is joined with a mathematically str uctured universe, derivation from ancient Mesopotamia must be suspected. It is the archety pal source, the navel of the world. In many cases, the center is conceived as an axi s extending vertically upward and downward, with the center at the conjunction of the four cardinal direction. This is the ancient model of sacred space, which corresponds in Synchrogr aphics with the form of the T.R.I., the Triaxial Retrograde Interface. The three in tersecting axes of Euclidean space with a shared coordinate. The Hindus had a version of this centering mechanism called the regents of the directions. Brahma was in the overhead position, Vishnu below, with Shiva as the vertical axis. Each directions is attributed to a god and quality. The essence of this image of the axial point or pole is that it symbolizes the way or pl ace of passage from motion to rest, time to eternity, separation to unity; but then also, conversely rest to motion, eternity to time, unity to multiplicity. The realizat ion of the nonduality of heaven and earth--even of being and nonbeing--is assimilated in the sacred center . The ego is sacrificed in the primal waters of deathlessness, and release d to be carried in all directions. This is the mystical-psychological sense of sac rifice in all great religions. A solar hero is the most frequent embodiment of this process of purgation, illumination, and unification. He unites the religious significance of the sun, the zodiac, and the seasons with circular or cyclic determinism.

We ourselves are already tha t light of consciousness, that ground of being. THE JUNGIAN APPROACH TO NUMBER Jung revealed how mythological images and numbers have always been associated wi th each other. Here, we find a correspondence between the Universe, #108, and cycles of the Sun. Von Franz summarizes her Jungian view: \" The concept of natural numbers rests on an archetypal foundation. It represent s a preconscious pattern of thought common to all human psyches, and therefore constitutes the basis for transmitting knowledge to a greater degree than myth ological images, which exhibit more ethnological variations. \"Those aspects of the number archetype which present-day Western mathe matics has made conscious in no way exhaust all its aspects...The preconscious aspect of natural numbers points to the idea of a numerical field in which individual numbers figure as energic phenomena or rhythmical configurations. The \"field,\" which we take t o represent the structural outlines of the collective unconscious, i s organized around the central archetype of the Self ( which corresponds with the Sun, which corresponds with 108, and Brahma ). For this reason historical mandala structures deserve particular attention. In corresponding \"cosmic models\" and mathematical representations of God, the first four numbers predominate to an exceptional degre e. \"...These synchronistic and parapsychological aspects of number...can only be fathomed when we take into account the unconscious emotional setup and preconscious fantasies of the abserver along with his conscious mental si tuation and outlook. The description of such phenomena will of course no longer produce universally valid theories, but rather transmittable realizations tha t can exert a mind- releasing, community-building effect, just as scientific advances did in the past. The common denominator in mankind's cognitive processes thereby shifts fro m the level of doctrinaire intellectualism onto another plane. It centers instead on the realization of an a priori psychic structure common to all men. Depending on the epoch and an individual's creative abilities, the basic substratum becomes clothed in t he most varied shapes and conscious formulations, progressively transforming 'ancient, eternal truths' into more highly differentiated conscious patterns of realizat ion. \"As the ultimate verification of these processes stands the objectiv e psyche and its synchronistic manifestations, which contain the mystery of the sporadic conjunction of psychic and physical events, revealing a common 'meaning.' . . .When we take into account the individual characteristics of natural numbers, we can actuall y demonstrate that they produce the same ordering effects in the physical and psychic real ms; they therefore appear to constitute the most basic constants of nature expressing u nitary psychophysical reality.\""},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" The Development of Mathematics According to Singer's A Short History of Scientific Ideas , something of the nature of mathematics must be much older than the earliest documented examples. In triba l pre- history mankind watched the movement of the heavens and kept tallies of the passage of cycles of both lunar and solar nature. The importance of the Sun grew with the rise of agriculture and the importance of dating planting and harvest times accurately . By Sumerian times, numbers were represented in a system which combined a decima l with a sexagesimal notation. It embodied the principle of place-value, but not as we now know it. Shifting a number one place to the left multiplied its value sixty-fold, succes sive shifts to the right corresponded to repeated divisions by sixty to form sexagesim al fractions. In later Babylonia of the Seleucid period, the texts employ a ' zero' to indicate an empty sexagesimal place between two other figures. Remnants of the sexa gesimal system survive with us in the 360 degrees of the circle, etc. The mathematical texts usually consist either of tables for multiplicat ion, squaring of numbers, etc. or of worked examples illustrating the solution of elementary geome trical or algebraic problems. The geometry amounts to little more than estimations of the ar eas of fields, though the special property of the right-angled triangle was known. The ra tio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, pi, was taken as equal to 3. This is the value adopted in the Old Testament, perhaps under Babylonian influence. The algebra of the Old Babylonians could solve quadratic equations by a procedure equivalent to evaluating the modern formula, which gives the roots in terms of the co- efficients, thought the known texts nowhere quote or prove this rule. They also handled linear equations in several unknowns and even attempted to solve cubic and biquadratic equations. The Old Babylonians astronomy amounted to little more than recognition of bright sta rs, arbitrary demarcations of the heavens, and often undated observations of striking ce lestial or atmospheric phenomena. There are also records of omens drawn from these, whose significance marks the beginning of astrology. Originally used to predict the fortunes of contending kingdoms, horoscope astrology subsequently developed into complex procedures for foretelling the destinies of individuals. The later or Seleucid texts, on the other hand, embody complicated systems of theoret ical astronomy. These were elaborated by the temple priests who observed the heave ns from characteristic stepped watch-towers or temples, of which the Tower of Babe l is a reminder. The periodicity exhibited by the planets, and more particularly the revolutions of the sun and moon, were utilized for the measurement of time. The monthly changes of the moon are more obvious than the annual travel of the sun. So the lunar calendar was retained for religious purposes, while the solar was adopted for agriculture."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"No natural numerical relation exists between the lunar month and the solar year. B ut by the fifth century BC, it was established that 19 solar years are equal to 235 lunar months (125 of 30 days and 110 of 29 days each) to within a fraction of a day. These 19 years, comprising 12 of 12 months each and 7 of 13 months each, were combined in a certain order to form what has been called, after the alleged Greek inventor Meton, the Metoni c Cycle. The sequence in which 29-day and 30-day months followed one another was seen to be affected by the variations in the rates of motion of sun and moon, by the latitutde of the moon, and by the inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon. In the tables for predicting the dates of successive new moons, separate columns indicated the corrections to be separately applied for these various factors a ffecting the length of the month. They represented fluctuating discontinuity between upper and l ower limits in a characteristic manner. The Babylonian tables, which extended a lso to the prediction of planetary phenomena, have been classified into two main systems, according to the mthods employed to represent the variation of the sun's rate of moti on through the course of a year. (adapted freely from The Short History of Science ). Indian Mathematics The Indus civilization also learned its first lessons in mathematics from a stronomy, the gateway to time reckoning and temple building. In the arithmetic of trade, the m erchants of India were the equals of those of Mesopotamia. Until about 2000 years ago, they probably used numerals made up of horizontal strokes. When they began to use dried palm leaves as writing material and developed a flowin g style of writing, they also began to join up these strokes, so that became and became .I n this way they gradually built up different signs for each number up to nine. Each sign could be conveniently used to indicate the number of pebbles in any groove of the abacus. The Indians learned how to tell not only how many pebbles are in a groove, but also which groove they are in. The far right stood for units, the next to the left for tens, t hen hundreds, and so on. An empty column used a dot, as we now use zero. Thus each value meant only that one figure. This system does away with space-consuming repetition. We can record the same number on any groove of the abacus by using the same sign. Saving space is only a small advantage. The great advantage of the Hindu system is that it enables us to cal culate with numbers. Other ancient systems of writing all relied on the use of different symbols f or the same number of pebbles in different grooves of the abacus. Before you could do written or mental calculations with them, you would need to learn a different table of additi on and multiplication for each groove. When there are only nine different signs, each of whic h can show the number of pebbles in any groove, and a zero indicates empty grooves, you need learn only one simple table, once and for all. You can carry over in your head because there is only one simple table to remember."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Hindu number language quickly led to a revolution in the art of calculation. The mathematicians of India began to think in fractions and write them in the modern way. By 500 AD, Indian mathematicians had solved problems that baffled the greates t scholars of antiquity. The mathematician Varahamihira calculated how to fore cast the positions of the planets; Aryabhata wrote a rule for finding square roots an d gave the value for pi as 3.1416. Around 800 Ad, this numerical system was exported to Baghdad on the age-old caravan route. The Muslims used trigonometry. Because they had mastered the new arit hmetic of India, they could make much fuller use of the geometry of Euclid. Improved navigationa l equipment emerged from the observatories which also had improved equipment. Knowledge took a big leap forward between 800-900 AD, when East met West in Baghdad, and the baseten system became the standard.. SYNERGETIC BASE-TEN NUMBER DYNAMICS \"Henri Poincare, for instance, says: \"Every whole [natural] number is detached from the others, it possesses its own individuality, so to speak; each one of them forms a kind of exception, for which reason also general theorems of number theory are but seldom forthcoming.\" Nevertheless, this indiv idual aspect of number appears to contain the mysterious factor that enables it to organize psyche and matter jointly.\" M.-L. von Franz, Number and Time \"Consequently, it is not only the parallelism of concepts which nowadays draw s physics and psychology together, but more significantly the psychic dynamics of the concept of number as an archetypal actuality appearing in its \"transgressive\" aspect in the realm of matter. It preconsciously orders both psychic thought processes and the manifestations of material reality. As th e active ordering factor, it represents the essence of what we generally ter m 'mind'.\" M.-L. von Franz, Number and Time The Synergetic Natural Number Continuum The continuum of base ten number is generally looked upon as a progressive and linear series of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Iterations signify the simple addition of the initial unit to each resulting member encountered in the continuing series of elements known as numbes. The digits 1 - 9 are known as integers or numerals. Of course, multiples of 10, 100, 1000, etc. are formed simply by adding zeros. Further analysis discloses that this continuum can be viewed as both pr ogressive and regressive. It is not exclusively linear, but has a cyclic function resulting from the terminal character of the last base digit and the next beginning initiated by zero producing the two-digit range. This doubling of number is for all practical purposes a cycl ic function that recycles again and again with each ten-fold group produced."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Besides the cyclic and ambidirectional aspects of the number series, there is also a periodic series of reversals that occur in conjunction with the cyclic aspect. This ongoing combination of diverse functions can be considered a mixing effect not unlike an egg beater that folds the medium over and over. Remember, from our previous discussion that \"OM is said to issue from a process of multifold reflection.\" That process, exactly, is revealed in the number continuum when we can hold a metaphorical mirror up to nature's primal manifestation--the natural number sequence. The key to the comprehensive analysis of general number behavior is found i n the concept of \"circular unity.\" Circular unity is an idea demonstrated by th e harmonious interaction of the first six numbers. SIX is the first perf ect number is the sum of its first three digits, or 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 1 x 2 x 3 = 6; 6 2 = 36; 36 x 3 = 108; 36 2 =1296 x 2 = 2592. The term \"unity\" (or Universe for that matter) implies something that i s composed of parts. Fuller agreed, and stated it as, Unity is plural and at minimum two, or at mi nimum six. The sequence of perfect numbers (6, 28, 496, etc.) does not have the structural nor metrological significance of the Holotomic Sequence, which graphically displa ys an important structural order within prime number distribution. Note that the first Pythagorean Triple 3:4:5 equals 12, which is Holotome A (which is also twice the first perfect number). 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. The sheer complexity of the waves and cycles that are generated wit hin the base ten continuum cannot be described nor explained with conventional modes of philosophical description. Number theorists must resort to higher mathematics. But these cy cles can be demonstrated graphically so they are visible even to those not mathematically inclined. Synchrographics has been systematically contrived to formally illustrat e behavioral patterns that have successfully led to a general understanding of the fundamental elements of the geometrical nature of the base ten system. Can we find a cosmic mandate expressing Fuller's assertion that unity is plural and at minimum sixfold? The Holotomes and Holotomic Sequence fulfill thi s mandate with neat, logical finite sections. They represent circular unity and whatever else remains of the \"infinite rest\" that swells beyond our immediate focus . When we refer to the base of a number system, such as base ten, we are also referr ing to the amount of iterations in a loop or cycle for the FOLDMENT that multiplies the base and the multiples of that base is for all purposes a circle. The coexistent independency and interdependency of the base digits creates the ra tional notion that continuity is discontinuous. From this we derive the closed loop logic of the Holotomes as discrete levels of finitude."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The graphic importance of this particular Holotomic Sequence is that c ircular symmetry is being conserved and may be enlisted as the fundamental refer ence key in the graphic investigation of number behavior. The primes are deployed i n symmetrical interface only within these specific Holotomic domains . The Synchrographic process of regarding symmetry as a primary analyti cal aspect of reference makes the Syndex archetypal system of fundamental classes of numbers possible. The foundation of this system is the palindromes and transpalindromes. These 12 archetypal classes of number are catalogued by the ambidirectiona l glyphs that discloses the transbinomial nature of any individual number. Only 12 permutations exist in the total foldment of the number field or domain: Retrosquare Primes, Retroprime composites, tranpalindromes squares, etc. The so-called four fundamental operations of arithmatic are in reality two bi nomial pairs: addition is reverse subtraction; multiplication is reverse division. The term transpalindrome is invoked merely to establish a context through which to establish a bilateral system of numerical classification, that is, to cre ate a notational link between any integer of 2-digits or more with its antithetical or reverse companion. For example, number 21 is the transpalindromic companion of number 12. This simple concept brings into being a host of valid structural relationships that w ould otherwise be totally ignored. For example, number 16 is the ONLY 2-digit square tha t is a prime when reversed: 16 is a square, 61 is a prime. We call number 16 a retroprime square, and number 61 is conversely termed a retrosquare prime. Without this classification system, it is impossible to analyze the number f ield. Palindromes, or binomial reflection numbers are neither purely accidental nor wi thout significance. Remember, OM issued fom a process of multifold reflection to c reate the entire universe of phenomena. It is through the classification process that the enigma of prime numbe r distribution has been solved. By labelling all possible permutations of the ambidirec tional system of number dynamics, we find there are twelve discrete members in t he domain of number class. In order to systematize the study of the base ten concept, a graphic format w as essential to organize sizable spans of the continuum for in-depth analysis. The enspiralment of number offered itself as the ideal format. The cyclations of the sprial could be r eferenced to the longer cyclic periods intrinsic to number itself. There are cycles w ithin cycles, more readily seen in graphic format than in a continuous sequence. This was the general reasoning for adopting the synchrographic methods: to condense , or sample the number continuum, and establish reference to related periods of cyclicity .

And the Hindus used exactly the same figures as metrological modules , as have all subsequent civilizations. Temple architecture is based on multip les of 36 = 6 2 . So, Numeronomy, the laws relating to the essential structure and dynamics of numbe r, is a new word for an extremely ancient science. This science, based on the knowle dge that the continuum contains a definite structural order with general laws that des cribe the nature of that order, has laws that relate to the general behavior of nature i tself."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"In Synchrographics, the cyclic and reflexive nature of the cardinal/ordinal num ber series is portrayed through a graphic context which reveals the minimal set of key numbers required to show the coherent nature of prime number order. Synchrographics suggests some new terms, including a 12 symbol alphabet which is justified by the context. Systematic investigation of the intrinsic struct ure of the numeric series is purely a matter of selecting a graphic method of mapping numbers in t heir natural order so that geometrical order is also an integral aspect of that se quence. The system of multiradial and multiaxial interfacing between number an d idea is called spatial formation. The maps that include the relationships of circ ular unity and the distribution of primes and other classes of number are call ed mandalogs. The employment of this multirelational spread sheet permits the number analy st to consider aspects of the numeric continuum that would otherwise not be taken into account and therefore beyond the order-seeking functions of human mentality. The first important concept of numeronomy is the exemplary base wave. The wave begins both before and after number 10. In fact, it is called the nineleven cyclofle x bacause it is the result of the mutual interaction of both nine and eleven. This wave begins at ten and concludes its first cycle at 99 (9x11 = 99). Then it continues through the multiples of 99 and never ends. This is called exemplary because it sets up a continuous pattern that never ceases and never changes. This pattern is responsible for the continuous integrity of number behavior. Numeronomy Numeronomy, or the laws governing the behavior of the continuum of quantitative notation is the natural result of numerology, the study of number. Numeronomy is the outcome of Synchrographics. Numbers speak for themselves through structure and behavior. The single most important discovery of the SYNDEX PROJECT is the Holotome and the Holotomic Sequence, created by prime number multiplexing. It w as discovered on Synchrograph C.

The Holotomic mandalogs display the retrograde symme try of each of the circular unities in the form of a half positive and half negative octave system predicated on the octave nature of the so-called base ten system of number. The base ten system of number is an octave system, where either one or nine can be seen as a null value event. Furthermore, this octave can be regarded as a cyclic function. The zero, one, or nine c an function as the null event which acts as the null value gap between the beginning and ending of the octave retrograde cyclation, due to its half positive and half negative symmetrical sycle (which negates the numerical value of one or nine hust as if t hey were of the same nature as zero). Due to the octave nature of the eight true numbers, no transpalindromic se quence can exceed an octave cycle. Each Holotome in the sequence of holotomes when represented in a radial series of the numbers is composed of a perfectly symmetrical array of prime numbers diame trically opposed to other prime numbers or numbers composed of primes multiplying other primes. Also, the intervals that separate the primes are diametrically oppos ed to the same magnitude intervals across the wheel, yielding 100% perfect radial symm etry. In the context of the Holotomes, then, the deployment of prime numbers is an orderly progression. This ends the tradition that the primes do not occur e according to any recognizable pattern. This is the essence of the holotomes and their graphic elegance. Graphical ele gance is often found in simplicity of design and complexity of data. Visually attractive gr aphics also gather their power from content and interpretations beyond the immediate displ ay of some numbers. The best graphics are about the useful and important, about life and death, about the universe. Beautiful graphics do not traffic with the trivial. On rare occasions, graphical architecture combines with the data content to yiel d a uniquely spectacular graphic. Such performances can be described and admired, but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonderful graphic in a million. Number is considered so simple and mundane in nature that a popular assumption exists that there is nothing more to know about it that could really be of any valid signific ance. In a sense, number is self evident and apparently contains no subtle mysteries. Contrary to this attitude, number is the repository of a highly complex syste m of very intricate and involved interrelationships that have shaped the cosmologi cal and religious backgrounds of all cultures. They affect us unconsciously at th e deepest levels of our belief system, which in turn conditions our thoughts, feel ing, and behavior. The true mechanisms operating in the number chain can be shown in a system of incremental spirals portraying the numeric continuum and the speci al events which occur in it. R.B. Fuller recognized this when he wrote to Marshall, March 3, 1981:"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"\" Your cyclic synchrographing work clarifies and simplifies this whole matter to an epochal degree.\" SYNCHROGRAPHICS Synchrographics is an innovative, systematic discipline interfacing the natur al base ten integer progression with the fundamental elements of geometry. This institutes a graphic synthesis of the the two basic disciplines which in essence are initially tw o interdependent concepts that only occur through their mutuality. The Pythagorean Triples that begin with the 3-4-5 triangle bring to note this initial unity of number and geometry attesting to the scientific validity of the synchrogr aphic method of analysing relationships. They are not at all evident without such an interdis ciplinary medium. Each holotome expressed in synchrographic form is geometrically symmetr ical. The base digits of the parallel spirals of iterating squares give direct visual e vidence of the factorial degree of any specific integer by the occurrence of squares that have been color-coded for that particular incident of synchronicity. In that the initial holotome is twelve and all subsequent holotomes are a multiple of tha t number, the valuable duodecimal interface that encompasses the base digits is r eflected in the substratum of all holotomes. Synchrographics offers a plausible answer to the question of why the Babylonians adopted the 360 degree circular unity. The ancient Hindus chose 108, which is 3 x 36.) The classic answer is that 360 has many divisors. But perhaps some unknown numerist discovered this sequence in the ancient past. This sequence is generated by doubling the first perfect number si x to equal 12. Then doubling 12 for 24. Then multiplying 24 by the first true prime 12 x 3 = 72. Then by multiplying that number by the next true prime 72 x 5 = 360. Then multiplying that by the next true prime: 360 x 7 = 2520, etc. By beginning with twelve we have already involved 2, 3, 4, and 6. By doubling 12 we have involved #8. or five of the base digits. By multiplying 24 by prime number three, we involve nine, or six base digits. By multiplying 72 by 5, we involve seven base digits or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9. Finally, by multiplying 360 by 7 we have captured them all: 2520. If the Babylonian metrologists knew of this, neither they nor modern number theorists make mention of it. Whatever the case, the Holotomes are ideally adapted as instruments for tranla ting intricate geometrical interrelationships into the language of number. Only throug h the careful study of these special modules does the exquisite order of prime number occurrance become obvious, for the primes are found to be deployed in symmetrical interface only within these specific holotomic domains."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Thus, number stripped of its structural character is reduced to the empty and monotonous iterations used essentially for counting objects and measuring distances . When numbers, on the other hand, are permitted to be deployed in cycles that are in phase with their already inherent rhythms, a clearer picture emerges. All mandalogs are the product of the systematic generation of the exact seque nce of minimax factorization. They have the perfect retrograde feature by which th e patterns generated in the first half of the spiral are reversed at mi dpoint and are reflected as a mirrored image in the second half of the spiral. Remember , OM was formed by multifold reflection! Also, because of the existence of palindromes and other reflective qualities issuing through each holotome there is an exemplary wave form that begins at the end of the fi rst holotome. This is a dual component wave, resembling the DNA helix. The wave begins amid number ten and is composed of square number nine and palindromic prime number eleven. This compound cyclic wave is labeled the nineleven cycloflex. It cycles and oscillates through multiples of ninetynine and produces decant or tenfold series of consistent tranpalindromic sequences or numbers. Each number in the sequence has its perfect reversal on the corresponding other side. The total reversal of number should always have been expected in that the number chain is by its graphic nature a two-way street, refolded again in the four fundamenta l operations of arithmetic. The graphic mandalogs contain a rational and logical system of interrelating num ber and geometry or quality and quantity. They are graphic expressions of identical idea s regarding the descriptions of events in nature. A critical consideration in expressing the optimum number of interrelated rati os is to do so with a minimum amount of graphic details. That is, to show the most information with the least given axis of reference. The mandalogs, or number wheels, are mathem atical entities which express a plurality of interdependent formulae in a simple si ngular system.

This number is cited in the Qabala as the perimeter of Solomon's temple: 3168 - 1008 = 3.1428571 (4 x 252). The secret traditions seem to have made liberal use of the Holotomes without ever pointing them out. The number 3168 has special qualities: By adding the palindrome which is the sum of a palindrome times another palindrome: 3168 5445 : 55 x 99 8613 We get a reversal of the initial number. The ninety-nine cycle is the carrier wave of the transpalindromic refl ection sequence. This sequence is crucial to the mapping of the natural numb er scenario because the 99 cycle issues through the Holotomes. The Holotomes are ideally adapted as an instrument for translating into the language of number the intricate geometrical interrelations between the configurat ions of cubic space. The Pythagorean Triples are the best examples of the interdependent nature of number and geometry. These triples logically deduced as an \"infinite set\" all sha re the 90 degree angle. They show the geonumeric character which describes the same ratios and interrelationships in different styles of notation. Synchrographics begins with the assumption that since number and geometry are two ways of expressing the same set of ratios or relationships, then it holds true tha t a graphic device may be generated that faithfully aligns these two methods of notation i n a synchronetic diagram. That is, a single notational system may express the geometrical nature of number and visa versa. The \"four progressively additive and four progressively subtractive ev ent octaves with a ninth null event\" depicts the primary cycle or finite extent of the initial program parameter. With the turnaround occuring at ten (between square number nine and pr ime number eleven), the nineleven wavecycle then begins and proceeds to for tynine and a half (49.5). It turns around and proceeds to ninetynine (99), and thereafter continues through the multiples of 99 to 1089 or the only four-digit transpalindromic square. This is not a guess, since the mandalogs demonstr ate it graphically."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The behavior or structure of the baseten system requires the perspective of an int egrated complex where number and geometry are interqualifying aspects of an unified sys tem of congruent identities. The character of notation determines whether data is in the form of number or geometry. Each requires the other in order to be expressed. This interdependency authorizes the synchrograph to represent a number as a geom etrical phenomena in which each holotome contains the triquadric core intitiated in number 12. (Holotome A) Thus, every subsequent holotome retains a copy of the initial data, plus new more involved data. Each and every holotome is a symmetrical retrograde MANDALOG, representing the four progressively additive then progressively subtractive e vent octaves with a ninth null event synchronicity. Altogether it represents the octave nine syst em of R.B. Fuller, or Marshall's nineleven cycloflex. The exemplary compound wavecycle which proliferates through the mult iples of 99 is the carrier wave that both integrates and isolates the Holotomes with accumulative integrity. In this scenario, the primes behave in an orderly m anner through their special palindromic members: 13 31 17 71 37 73 79 97 The four pairs of two-digit palindromic primes form the octave bridge i n the 99 cycle. The general laws of number behavior can now be written from the behaviors clarified through synchrographic mapping techniques. Numeronomy is th en expressed or emanated through the transpalindromic functions, which remain unseen in classical number theory and structure. The intellectual separation of geometry from number removed from number the purely geometrical aspects of the numerical continuum that made the holotomes apparent as symmetrical mathematical entities. Only through the study of these special modules does the exquisite orde r of prime number occurrence become obvious. These geometric number wheels are u nique examples of circular unities. The primes are deployed in symmetrical interface only within these s pecific Holotomic domains. There is a way in which to seek out these entities by intermultiplying the pri mes from a special base module. Much in the way that the factorials are produced but with the difference that diminishes the huge sums that result from the redundant multiplic ation of the accumilating composites, out of what would have been primes. We begin with six, the first perfect number, then double it to produce 12, which we call a holotome.

This number wheel contains all of the needed geometry by which to proliferate the family of related Holotomes. All mandalogs are the product of the systematic generation of the exact seque nce of minimax factorization. They have the perfect retrograde feature which re verses at midpoint, because of the existence of palindromes and other reflective qualities. The first solid indication of a rational link between prime numbers and square numbers was found in the diagram entitled the prime/square inter face which actually includes the composites in that the full overview addresses th e holistic interaction of all classes. The prime/square interface diagram consists of a vertical column of the f irst one hundred and one numbers with their squares listed on a right hand colum n.

The cycle that contains the exemplary basewave that is essential to th e structural integity of the Holotomes. This wave in a certain sense is such that it determines the point places in the continuum where discontinui ty may or may not occur. The mandalog, then, is a graphic mathematical entity for the expression of a plurality of interdependent formula in a simplicated singular system , i.e. an information containment mechanism, or book: Holotome. Such a device contains information and is at the same time a device to convey information clearly and accurately, with a minimal possibility of ambiguit y, error, or paradox. In classical systems of encoding and conveying information, elements of paradox occur through the vehicle of language itself. The fault generally exists in the very foundation of language at the fundamental level of syntax. It is through the transpalindromic nature of the natural baseten number sequence that the irregular occurrence of prime numbers is recognized as a pure ly causally- determined pattern of rational explanation. The classical approach to a study of prime numbers is such that the primes are c onsidered more or less estranged from other classes of numbers in hopes that the primes mig ht manifest some intrinsic rhythm of their own that could be found to account for distribution, density, etc. No single class can be isolated as an element responsible as a determinant of any specified classes of behavior, since the full compliment of classes that compri ze the self- modifying continuum interact congressionally.

Fuller did not have the advantage of synchrographs to clearly see and properly describe this basewave. This description of an octave-nine system had t he turnaround at fifty. The true nineleven turnaround is a 49.5. The graphic mandalogs allow us to monitor the exemplary basewave that is guided through the continuum of natural number by the cyclic and reflexive qualit ies inherent in the special or noble numbers. In the Prime/Square Interface Diagram, the basewave is seen to contain itself throught the palindromic mechanism that is sustained through the four pairs of transpalindromic primes that act as transnumeric relay stations. The tapestry of number is literally woven with the four warps and four woofs, or octa ve, of the transpalindromic bridge between the fist and only two-digit pralindromic pr ime number 11 and the first, but not only, 3-digit prime number 101--primes that are known to proliferate palindromes in being multiplied by themselves. The full importance of the basewave continuity observed in the multiples of 99 is only realized when investigating its involvement in the structure of the Holotomes. The i nitial holotomes contain only a rational section of a complete cycle; that portion necessa ry to insure a quality of infinity, (the number repeating itself indefinitely). The number structure or number behavior mapping technique makes number theory visibly coherent. Synchrographic techniques are scientifically systema tic. The general scheme of Numeronomy involves a more complete system of classification which t akes special note of both the palindromic and transpalindromic nature of number. It is possi ble (but remains to be calculated), that the holotomes contain a consistent ratio betwe en primes and non-primes with the holotomes that precede and follow. TRANSPALINDROMES Transpalindromicity of number is merely a term by which we include t he reversal of any particular number exceeding a single digit. For example, 16 and 61. Another example involving a transpalindromic distinction is when a reversed number remains in its class, like 13 and 31 which are both primes, i.e. transpalindromic primes as compared to a simple palindromic prime such as eleven. These are only twelve permutations possible within the whole continuum of number. The complete analysis of number behavior is not possible without taking into account the palindromic and transpalindromic characters of number. This is the crucial and paramount reason that the behvaior of prime numbers have remained an enigma for so long."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Number theory has ignored the ambidirectional reflexivity inherent in the number continuum. Regaining an impartial view of how reflexivity is totally conserved w ithin the continuum leaves no gaps in the concept of numerical continuity. The synchrographs and mandalogs used in this study are to support the continuity that ha s been disrupted by the belief that prime numbers are without connective order. Toward this end, we introduce approximately 16 new words that fill in the missing blanks to for m a coherent picture or concept of true number dynamics. The term \"synchrostat\" designates an event synchronicity in the numeric continuum. This term and its subsequent Tables were valuable tools in indentifying a cyclic se ries of numbers that embody features that were common to all members of the series. They embody and exemplify a practice that was used to explore many other cycle s until the main base cycle was finally discovered. (Synchrostat illus. here.) Comprehend the universal nature of the transpalindromic function of number behavior is not easy. We tend to see the number chain as a unidirectional continuum, which is too linear for a synergetic perspective. Revisionin g it with the concept of simultaneous counterflow yields a more accurate picture. With large spans of number, the complex interrelationships become difficul t to visualize. Fortunately, because of the octave nature of the base cycle there cannot be mor e than four consecutive transpalindromic pairs in a single symmetrical se quence, regardless of the amount of digits in each individual number. However, we are only looking at the multiples of nine. But, in fact, all the numbers in between are also involved in transpalindromic transactions. To address such a comple x interchange by graphic means can only be accomplished in a series of static c ross- sections each involving no more than the eight required transactions. The exemplary 99 wavecycle affords us a context that gives a graphic expres sion of total transpalindromic symmetry which it is possible to contemplate with clarity . All the Holotomes contain the same general mechanism seen in the 99 cycle, but even t he Holotomes must be contemplated in various graphic modes to capture their full integr ity. Transpalindromicity functions through the ambidirectional nature of number. It is therefore, the initial or primary function of number behavior in general. All detai ls of number behavior derive primarily from a transpalindromic function operating throug h an ambidirectional chain of ambidirectional numerical events. If any aspect of direction is left unconsidered in the behavior of any specifie d event then behavior observed in connection with that event will have been compromised.

Thus a cycloflex or wave-cycle is apparent. In addition to this +4, -4 cycle, the multiples of eleven produce a consistent series of t wo- digit palindromes: The first eight multiples of 11 are palindromes which then repr esent an octave of 8 forward ambidirectional number events, ending in 99 or 9 x 11: 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 Thus, the number 99 is composed of 2 discrete octave sets that are synchron ous: 9 11 18 22 27 33 36 44 45 55 54 66 63 77 72 88 81 99 90 The number 99, then, is a crucial module in the description of number behavior.

In the classical approach to the study of prime numbers, the primes are conside red more or less estranged from the other classes of number, in hopes that the primes might manifest some intrinsic rhythm of their own that could be found to account for distribution, density, etc. Since the full compliment of classes that comprize the self-modifying numeri cal continuum interact congressionally, no single class can be isolated as an elem ent responsible as a determinant of any specified classes behavior. Synchrographic analysis has shown that an exemplary waveform is inherent in the structuring of the base digits. When issuing through the sequence of numbers it mainta ins its own structural quality while modifying the quality of the numerical event identities it encounters. This waveform occurs through the mutual interaction of square number nine and palindromic prime number eleven. In that nine times eleven equals ninetynine, the wave proliferates through the multiples of ninetynine. Together, this pair interact to produce the exemplary transpalindromic wave cycle sequence which integrates the full band of number classes.

That any number of two or more digits, with the exception of numbers ending with a zero, has a reverse mate is obvious. The reverse of number twelve is twenty one, the reverse of thirteen is thirtyone, etc. This is the transpalindromic aspect of real numbers. If the reverse mate of any specific number was of the same class as it s forerunner then there would be no reason to regard the transpalindromic aspect as a designation of an y structural distinction. It would simply be an \"artifact\" of the so-calle d Arabic numeral system. But, since for example, a square may be a prime when turned around, a struc tural distinction is obvious. The square number sixteen becomes a prime when reversed. Sixteen, then, may be referred to as a retroprime square.

The case has not yet been reported where this does not hold true. Even though this postulate is unprovable in the sense that all even numbers can't be checked out, it may be provable through a true understanding of how the sequence of number operates. No even number may be a prime because of the prior occurence of number 2, which acts as a divisor for all even numbers. The first three odd numbers are primes because no number preceding them has occurred that could act as a divisor. Number 9 is the first odd number that is not a prime, because of the prior occurrence of number 3. Therefore, the occurrence of the first odd number as a composite is the result of the previous occurrence of an odd number that had no preceding idvisors except unity, which by definition is indivisible. So, the composite nature of 9 is causally determined in t hat 9 would have been a prime like all previous odd numbers, but for the prior occurrence of number 3. From this it may be postulated that all even numbers will be composites, and all odd numbers are potentially primes unless some previous odd number has occurred that acts as a factor, rendering them composites. This is also a way of saying that every odd number that is not a prime is the product of at least one previous prime and one previous composite, (3 + 6 = 9). But the serial equitability of the progressively divisible number chain produce s a surplus of combinations to produce primes from even numbers. In fact, as numbers progress composites will occur that accomodate multiple sets of primes and visa versa. Doe s this not render the Goldbach Postulate only a probability? The assumption that all odd numbers would be primes if no previous number had occurred that would act as a divisible factor perfectly fits the casse. If the prior number"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"had bnot occurred, or could be stricken our, as in the case of number three, 9 would be a prime number, but since three is three and not something else, 9 is a composite. The fact that nine is also a square number tells us also that the generation of squares , cubes, etc. is also the result of the occurrence of previous odd numbers, as two odds make an even and two of the same numbers multiply into a square number. Continuity is a provisional term that requires a context describing a series of entity events that connect or disconnect to or from each other. The primes have always been regarded as a single class with no breakdown into subclasses, no different kinds of primes. Secondly, the primes have been viewed apart from the composites, thereby ignorin g any relationships that they certainly must share with the other classes of number. The first indications that other classes of primes exist was found in the nature of square numbers which range from 2 to 20 with one exception: none differ from each other by 16, reflecting our exceptional 2-digit prime/square reversal. The first three digits--1, 2, and 3--are geneerally regarded as primes, but t he initial members are in a class by themselves. One is not even a number, in the serial sens e. It doesn't multiply like real numbers do. Two is also not a number, but is the source of the doubling of unity--duality. 1 x 2 is 2 x 1. It is the source of duality, eveness or balanced symmetry, and essentially static state. Two is the symmetry aspe ct of the one continuum. Three is also not a number, but the source of imbalance and asymmetry, a source of dynamic flow. It represents the unitary aspect of the bipolar continuum. The sour ce of oddity or difference with these three qualities produces number four, the first r eal number or the idea of quantity/quality and dimensionality of the tetrahedron. \"This intellectual step from two to three is a retrograde one, a reflection le ading from two back to the primal one,\" according to von Franz. \" In principle this procedure can be repeated with all subsequent numbers. The retrograde counting step leading from the number three to four has even been made historically famous by Maria Prophetessa's alchemical axiom.\" (see Jung's Transformative Process, SYNDEX I). I t means that the number three, taken as a unity related back to the primal one, becomes the fourth. The four is understood not so much to have 'originated' progressively, but to have retrospectively existed from the very beginning. Even and odd are established in the ideas of two and three.

Two odds make an even. 9 is axially odd, but radially even. The SYNDEX description of number behavior employs the overview of the cycloflex. It represents the reality of function that is both cyclic and oscillatory, i.e. both rota tional and reciprocating. In describing number behavior and dynamics, it becomes necessary to show the interaction existing between palindromic numbers and transpalindromic numbers--a n interaction that is in essence a cyclic behavior. The retrograde functions progress to a point and then reverse in octave cycles of four forward and four backward number events. This is a wave-cycle or cycloflex. Continuity in the description of the exemplary basewave cannot mean in the sense of something uninterrupted because it must be curtailed on the upper limit of the Holotome for the sake of holistic unity. Continuity has given trouble to the number theorist because of the mind's insistance that any specific integer is an isolated idea entity and connot be effected by anot her integer, several or even many times removed. But this is, in reality, the case when numbe r 9 is not a prime because of the usurpation of its \"primeness\" by 3. This transinteger dynamic is a passive dynamic. It happens as acausal determ inate which means the retrograde loops on the SYNDEX number maps are left to show the truth. The number reversals that purport to carry the exemplary wave are gestures of quasi- disconnective continuity because the relations must be shown that we may see how numbers interact as they flow towards some \"nothing\" called infinity. The prior reference to approach of holistic continuity at the end of a Holotome is the f inal non-event of such a specific system. The octave is best deactivated at these discrete points. It is predominantly the Holotomes that clarify the distribution of prime numbe rs, for the primes are symmetrically arrayed within the context of each holotom e. The radial symmetry of the holotomes is, in itself, the geometriccal proof of numer ical coherency. That each subsequent holotome admits one, and only one, additional divisor establishes a rational medium between prime numbers and the sequence of specifi c compositry. Though the structure of the basseten continuum is a highly complex order, there are graphic methods by which the more important aspects of that order may be aprrecia bly simplified. For example, there are very rare, often unique examples, of certain classes of number that occur seldom or even just once in the two-digit numbers. It was through the discovery of these rare or noble examples that the exemplary basewave cycle was disc overed. Once that cycle was isolated it was a simple matter to extrapolate into the high er orders to"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"secure the multiple digit cousins of these nobel examples for comparisons to confirm the sustained functions of cycles being investigated. A basewave was long ago suspected by the classical number theorists, but its elus ive nature was due to the fact that it was not a singular wave form but a compound variety. A wave composed of the mutual interaction of square number nine and prime number eleven, whose essential palindromic nature is connected with the transpalindromi c aspects of the total numeric profile. The synchrographs act as maps by which we may follow the progress of this exe mplary wave cycle. It is a feature that would not in any way be apparent without such a systematic graphic mechanism. The nineleven wave is further caged by such features of the continuum as the lone pair of 4-digit transpalindromic squares--those being the square of 33 and 99: 1089 and 9801. These two interreflecting squares neatly bracket an octave sequence of four forward and four reverse multiples of the first square which signficantly includes a c enter or nave number which is a palindrome which results from two 2-digit palindromes. By and large, it is predominantly the holotomes that clarify the distribution of prim e numbers because the primes are symmetrically arrayed within the context of each holotome. And the number of primes in each holotome is determined by the total modular amount of the previous holotome. For example, Holotome E or #2520 contains 367 primes or just seven more than Holotome D which is #360 (360 x 7 = 2520), and Holotome D contains 72 primes where #72 is the modular sum of the previous holotome. The fundamental intent of the initial idea was to create a context which would geometrically paraphrase the elements of numerical progression in a graphic s ysstem that involves the primary elements of plane or two dimensional geometry. The two axes provide a base for symmetry as a reference to sysstematically involve the cyclic and wave functions of the numeric continuum.

Spiritual existence is that which is never lost . The common core of most religions is devotional mysticism, based on the Sound Current, Word, or Holy Name. It is rooted in meditation (inner journeys) whether it appears i n Judaism, Sufism, Tantra, Taoism, etc. While science explores outer phenomena, t he field of mysticism explores the inner realms, which can be perceive d only by our soul. A study of the different major religions reveals that each has an esot eric core. The essence of each religion is the union of the soul with God. Mysticism is the study of how we can achieve this divine communion with the Lord. Martin Buber explained that the ecstasy is not a sudden absorption into t he Universal Soul, but a steady progress forward, progress which is constant and w ell- controlled. God pervades the entire creation. The soul of man is a spark of Divi nity and our principle duty is to take the soul back to its source. This can be done by the power of Shekhina, the equivalent of the Name or Word, which is described as the Emanation and Glory of God whose presence and power sustain every creatur e. The Masters or Zaddiks preached the banishing of all worldly desires and m erging them in a single desire to meet God. The purpose of this introductory essay is to familiarize us with some impor tant aspects of the mystical tradition of Judaism. The Jews over the ages have tende d to discourage the practice of magic or practical qabalah, choosing instead to kee p their emphasis on love. Both Talmudic and Kabbalistic schools emphasize the nee d of mentors or Masters, well-familiar with the experiential territory.

Kabbalah is the st udy of the system of our spiritual roots which emanate from Above. There is none e lse but the Creator. According to contemporary Kabbalists of B'nai Baruch, \" The Kabbalah teaches the cause effect connection of our spiritual sources.

The answer is very simple It is only possible when we spiritually lift ourselves up above this world. This is possible only if we rid ourselves of all of the traces of mat erial egoism and accept the spiritual values as the only ones. Only the longing and the passion for the spiritual in our world, is the key for the higher world. A person' s main objective is to elevate the importance of the Creator in his own eyes, i.e. to ac quire faith in His greatness and might, since this is his only possibility to escape from the prison of personal egoism, and into the higher worlds. The method of breaking free from the slavery of egoism is found in the Kabbalah. The worst egotism is arrogance and conceit.

At God's behest, Moses brought the Torah -- the divine \"teaching\" or \"revelation\" -- to the children of Israel. Thus the early Israelites also had a direct mystical e xperience of God. Many of the patriarchs and prophets whose lives and teachings are given in the Bible are described as mystics who heard God's \"voice\" and \"Word,\" who relied on His \"Name,\" and otherwise had direct communion with Him. A ccording to J. Abelson, an early twentieth-century scholar of Jewish mysticism, \"Jewis h mysticism is as old as the Old Testament...The Old Testament scintilla tes with sublime examples of men whose communion with God was a thing of intense r eality to them.\" It is important to remember that the Hebrew Bible as we know it today i s not an exact and accurate rendering of the words of the mystics and prophets. Contemporary scholars, tracing the styles of several scribes in its narrative s, have concluded that the Hebrew Bible is probably the work of several authors of different periods, with differing purposes and levels of spiritual attainment. Throughout history, scribes and scholars of all religions have subtly altere d the teachings of the mystics, albeit unintentionally. Because they were not of the same spiritual level as the mystics whose works they were attempting to rec ord, and because they were often writing from memory, these scribes may have unwittingly misinterpreted or obscured the mystics' teachings. In many places in the Bible, therefore, the mystical aspects or implications of the prophets' mes sage may actually have been lost. Mystics often couched their teachings in parables and symbols, so that the d eeper meaning of their words would be hidden to all but their closest disci plines. In some instances, for example, where the prophets appear to be speaking about polit ical or social issues, they may have also been speaking on a mystical or esoteric level, w ith the political or social situation used as an allegory or symbol. During the period of the prophets, the priestly classes were the pri mary authority in Judaism. The priests performed specific religious functions in the temple in Jerusalem, and in daily Jewish life as well. With the destruction by the R omans of the second temple in the year 70 C.E., the role of the priestly classes began to change and their power started started diminishing. The institution of th e \"rabbi\" (literally, \"teacher,\" or \"master\"), as the primary authority in Judaism, arose during the first and second centuries C.E., becoming greatly strengthened during the peri od of Islamic rule, and continuing until today."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The discovery of the scrolls at Qumran and other long-hidden early texts reveal s that, from the second century B.C.E. and possibly even earlier, there wer e several ascetic and possibly mystical sects coexisting with the mainstream of organized priestly Judaism. It is believed that John the Baptist, and probably even jes us of nazareth, came from one of these sects, the Essenes. The teachings of Philo Judaeus, the first-century Jewish mystic of Alexan dria, Egypt, are of great interest from the mystical point of view. Philo wrote about G od as the Word or Logos. For many centuries, Philo had more influence on Christian ity than on Judaism, because until the 1700s his writings were hardly known to Jew ish scholars and theologians. In the same spirit as Philo, the commentators On kelos and Jonathan ben Uzziel, in their Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible, r endered the name of God Jehovah (wherever it appears) as the memra, or \"utterance,\" clearly a reference to the creative Word, or Sound, of God. After the Bible, the second great written work in Jewish history is t he Talmud, which represents almost one thousand years of rabbinic thought. Its fou ndation were laid during the middle of the fourth century B.C.E. in the communi ty of the returned exiles from Bab ylonia. The Talmud exists in two versions -- one Palestinian and the other Babylonian (both edited during the fifth cent ury C.E.) -- reflecting the thinking of the two academies of rabbis. Most of the Talmud is concerned with law, but it also contains a good deal of moralistic, legendary, and mystical material. The \"Ethics of the Fathers,\" a collection of ethical and moral saying of the rab bis of the talmudic period, contains some highly mystical material as well. However , on the whole, from the period of the Talmud onward, most rabbis were suspici ous of mysticism. Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser explains: Some teachers of the Talmud cultivated the mystical life...[but] while recording the views of those teachers who sought to cultivate mystical interest , the Talmud indicates that the religious authorities of the time tried to discourage t his tendency. . .In some instances mystical pursuits became intertwined wi th magic, which was, no doubt, an additional factor that inspired the effort to discourage it. Contemporary rabbi David Blumenthal explains that during the talmudic pe riod, some of the rabbinic tradition rubbed off on Jewish mysticism, hence the intellectualism or \"bookishness\" of Jewish mystic literature. He says that the general concept of Judaism that we have today stems from rabbinic Judaism. Fr om then on, those rabbis who were devoted to the mystic life tend to be secr etive about their teachings and practice, using esoteric symbols and stories th at could be understood only by the \"initiated.\" But still, Blumenthal explains, dur ing the course of Jewish history there was often a give-and-take between the rationalisti c rabbis and the mystics; and just as mysticism tended to be expressed in intel lectual terms, often the scholarship of the rationalists became infused with a s uppressed mystic yearning. \"There is hardly a symbol, act, or belief in the rabbinic tradition wh ich was not touched, and transformed by the mystical tradition.\""},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The mystical side of Judaism during the talmudic period and continuing in to the Middle Ages is represented for the most part in the heckalot literature. Heckalot literally means \"palaces,\" or \"halls.\" These works describe the me ditation practices of Jewish mystic who were attempting to take the mystic journey through th e iner regions or palaces on the merkavah, \"chariot,\" of light and sound. The chariot metaphor is taken from the mystic experiences of Elijah and Ezekie l in the bible. Most of the works describing the merkavah journey were written between the first century B.C.E. and the tenth century C.E. and are called the greater and less er heckalot . Sometime between the third and sixth centuries C.E. appeared one of th e most powerful works of Jewish mysticism to survive till this day. Only two thous and words long, the Sefer Yetzirah (\"Book of Formation\") is an attempt to describe the mystery and structure of creation by means of numbers, and as such it is si milar to the teachings of Pythagoras. With a minimum of words, it describes the creat ion as series of emanations from the one divine Name, Word, or utterance. The concept of creation by emanation is also found in the literature of the medieval Jewish mystics, many of whom were part of the Sufi mystic tradition in Egypt and Spain. Sufism was a mystic teaching which appeared in the Islamic world from approximately the tenth century. The focus of Sufi philosophy was God-re alization through mystic practice and devotion rather than through intellectual p ursuit or performance of ritual. The Sufis emphasized the need to control the mi nd and senses and eliminate the ego in order to travel on the spiritual path. Jewish Sufi manuscripts discovered during the late nineteenth cen tury in the Cairo Genizah (a hidden attic in an ancient synagogue) have shed great light on the cl ose relationship between Jewish and Muslim mystics of medieval times. From the eleventh to fourteenth centuries, Jewish mystics translated and free ly quoted from Sufi mystical writings, and some pursued the spiritual path under th e guidance of Sufi masters. Similarly, during almost the same period, Jewish mystics i n Persia and Turkey shared a devotional spirit with the Muslim mystics of their ti me. Many read Hebrew translations of the works of Rumi and Sa'adi. The Jewish mystics in the Sufi tradition were sometimes called has idim (\"devotees,\" \"pious ones\"). Althought this movement, and the Hasidei Ashkenaz movemen t which arose in Germany during the thirteenth century, were not connect ed historically with what later became known as Hasidism -- the ecstati c religious movement which began in eighteenth century Poland -- they foreshadowe d many of its elements, particularly the emphasis on devotion, spiritual inwardn ess, and personal experience of God. Bahya ibn Paquda of eleventh-century Spain was a mystic in the Sufi tradition . His book Hovot ha-Levavot , \"Duties of the Hearts,\" deals with the life of the true \"servant,\" the devotee yearning for the mystical life. Solmon ibn Gebirol, al so known as Avicebron, was Bahya's older contemporary; in his mystical work Mekor Haym , \"Fountain of Life,\" he described the creation as a series of emanation fr om the primal source of light. This teaching was echoed by many later Jewish myst ics,"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"especially the Kabbalists, and parallels the descriptions of the creati on given by mystics from many traditions. Moses Maimonides, author of the philosophic masterpiece The Guide for the Perplexed , lived in Cairo during the twelfth century. Noted as a philosopher, physician, and rationalist, Maimonides was also a mystic who stressed the poss ibility of direct spiritual experience through mystic practice. His son Abraham and grandson Obadyah were mystics in the Sufi tradition, whose works have recently been rediscovered and published. The most renowned aspect of Jewish mysticism, which has almost taken on life as a religious movement and influence in itself, is the Kabbalah, which lite rally means \"receiving\" or \"tradition.\" The development of Jewish Sufism may have prep ared the way for acceptance and growth of the Kabbalah. The term Kabbalah is normally used to refer to a large number of complex, esoteric works dating from t he thirteenth century which draw on the Bible, the Talmud, and other text s. Its precursors were the Sefer Yetzirah, the works of Ibn Gebirol, and the twelfth- century work, the Sefer ha-Bahir (\"Book of Brilliance\"). But when most contemporary Jews think of the Kabbalah, they generally have in mind the Zohar (\"Radiance\" or \"Shining\"), the longest and most influential work of the Kabbalah. Although it had been widely believed that the Zohar was written during the more ancient talmudic period by Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai, recent scholarship has shown that, at the earliest, it was written in the late th irteenth century by Moses de Leon of Spain. At that time, it was not uncommon for authors of religious texts to claim that they had discovered manuscripts writte n in earlier periods. Such works are called pseudo-epigraphic. They seek the authen ticity and credibility that come from authorship by an ancient, respected master . However, although De Leon may have been the actual writer of the Zohar, many scholars and students of mysticism feel that he was indeed compilin g, recording, and synthesizing mystical traditions dating from earlier times. Clearly, ma ny of the Zohar's underlying principles coincide with universal mystic teachings -- for instance, the theory of creation as an emanation from the original divine light; t he concept of spiritual, astral, and physical levels of creation; reincarnation, e tc. But the Jewish mystics of the Zohar gave expression to their mystic experiences by linking them to biblical references and couching them in terms acce ptable to Jewish tradition. Also enmeshed in the Zohar are accretions of legend, ritual, and superstition that reflect the influences of the many cultures in w hich Jewish mystics and seekers lived after their exile from Judea. The Kabbalists maintained that God's real Torah, or teaching, is the Zohar, and that what we commonly know as the Torah is a hint to the Zohar's esoteric teachings. They felt that God gave the Zohar and other kabbalistic works for those initiated into \"the inner mysteries,\" and that the Bible exists as a hin t to those esoteric teachings. They often referred to the Kabbalah as \"the hidd en science.\""},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Most of the works grouped in the Kabbalah teach a theosophy or cosmogony concerning the nature of God and structure of the universe. In contrast t o the Sufi teaching, they do not generally urge a devotional approach in pursuing direct experience of and attachment to the Divine. In this sense, Kabbalah becom es what the Indians call gyana yoga, \"the yoga of knowledge,\" where the Sufi or hasidic tradition is more like bhakti yoga, \"the yoga of devotion.\" As Bokser explained, the Kabbalah \"proceeds through an intricate web of esoteric symbols, and its of fering is primarily a gnosis, an esoteric knowledge which in itself is said to yield m an the highest rewards of divine commendation.\" The Kabblah was an influence not only on the Jew; Christian scholars looked into its symbols and allegories and found symbols of Jesus and his teachings. The Kabbalah is also the focus of Freemasonry and other secret societies, whi ch have as their goal the discovery of mystical knowledge they believe to have been handed down through the generation since the time of Adam [the 'Lost Word\" in Mason ry]. According to the Freemasons, the Zohar itself is the vehicle of the most profound religious mysteries, reveal only orally in previous ages, to which hints exis t in secret manuscripts. Abraham Abulafia, a mystic and student of Kabbalah of thirteenth-century S pain and Italy, taught his followers an actual system of meditation and concentration based on combinations and permutations of letters and words, with the goal of entering the inner spiritual realms. Abulafia was excommunicated as a heretic by the orthodox Jewish authorities of his time, and many of his manuscripts were lost for several centuries. Today modern researchers have been successfully u nearthing and studying them, bring to light a lost chapter in Jewish mystical history. Although some Jewish mystics claim success in following the complicat ed practices of letter and word combinations and permutations, as taught by Abulafia and othe r Kabbalists, there are many more stories relating the dangers and pitfalls experienced within by practitioners. Despite the dangers, however, som e Jewish mystics continued to teach these practices openly until the sixteent h century, when it became more expedient to hide their use; and by the eighteenth ce ntury they had almost died out. Since the 1970s in the United States, however, with the resu rgence of interest in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, a number of seekers have begu n attempting these techniques once again, using old manuscripts as mode ls and guides. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many Kabbalists had gather ed in Safed, palestine. Rabbi Isaac Luria, who was known as ha-Ari (\"the Lion\"), was the center of this circle of Safed mystics. Also known as \"the divine Rabbi Isaac,\" he w as said to possess \"the holy spirit\" and to have been given \"the revelation of Elijah,\" L uria appears to have transformed the doctrine of emanation described in the Zohar into amore complex system and also taught name and letter combination techn iques for concentration. During the seventeenth century, a Jewish mystic by the name or Sarmad set tled in India. Born into a rabbinical family of Kashan, Persia, he came to India as a trader"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"and experienced a spiritual transformation. Sarmad is still revered throu ghout India, yet little is known about the details of his life, and western Jud aism is largely unaware of him. From his teachings, however, we can see that Sarmad was a true mystic of the highest order, a sauna who transcended the outer formalities of religion and found the Lord within himself. He sang of union with the Name, the inner divine music. Some sources say he converted to Islam and then to Hi nduism, but if one reads his rubaiyats carefully, it is clear that although he examine d all religions, he rejected their external limitations, embracing the inn er teaching which he recognized as only One. He boldly sang of his unconventional love for the Lord and taught others to do the same. Ultimately, in 1959/60 he was beheaded as a heretic by Aurangzeb, Mogul emperor of India. The most recent flourishing of mysticism in Judaism is Hasidism, whi ch appeared in Poland at the end of the eighteenth century, a time when Jews were being persecuted at the hands of the authorities. There was deep yearning for G od to reveal himself, for a religious renewal which would lift the soul out of the sufferings of the world. Hasidism fulfilled this need and was the movement wh ich quickly transformed Judaism. During this time, many spiritual teachers appear ed, who were call rebbes or zaddiks (\"masters\") by their disciples. The first hasidic master, the Ba'al Shem Tov (literally, \"Master of the Good N ame\") was a simple, uneducated man -- the antithesis of the traditional rabbi, who was generally a scholar and an intellectual. The Ba'al Shem Tov communed with God internally and preferred the stillness of nature to the synagogue. It is s aid that he was able to speak to and understand the birds and animals. He spoke of seein g the divine Light and taught his followers the importance of devekut, \"attachment\" or cleaving to God at every moment of their lives. There were many other hasidi c masters, like Rabbi Nahman of Batslav and Dov Baer, the Maggid (\"spiritual channel\") of Mezherich -- spiritual teachers whose legends and parabl es are quoted even in present times. At first the Hasidim were considered as heretics by mainstream Jewi sh rabbis and the community at large; some were even excommunicated and their wri tings put in herem, \"quarantine,\" and reading them was forbidden. Later, however, as the hasidic rebbes gathered more and more adherents, their teachings spr ead and gained strength amongst the people. Nowadays, the descendants of the Hasidim still follow the rebbes of their respective lines, but the teachings have for the most part become another form of orthodox ritual and study of scripture, though someti mes infused with an intensity, joy, and fervor that reflect their true hasid ic origin. At the end of the nineteenth century there was a decline in mystical s eeking in Judaism, as the Haskalah, the 'enlightenment\" movement, took over. All over th e world, science became the new god, and people rejected religion -- es pecially mysticism -- as superstition. However, in certain parts of Europe there w ere small groups of mystics who continued to study the Kabbalah, while some hasidic l ines maintained their integrity, if not always the purity of their original purpos e."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"And still today, there are mystic seekers practicing within the bou ndaries of traditional Judaism. During twentieth century, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Mart in Buber, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, and others have emphasized once again the need for inwardness in spiritual devotion. Sin ce the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in the study of Jewish mystics of the past , and some seekers have attempted to follow their meditational practices. This has led to examination of self and tradition. As Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser wrote, The mystical spirit that craves for a direct encounter with God, for a fres h illumination of soul, is not content with pondering a tradition, even a mysti cal tradition. To gain this boon the mystic must travel the lone road of meditation , of struggling with his own opaque material self, to break the barrier that separates him from God and to enter directly into contact with the divine mystery. Over the ages, mystics have used many metaphors to convey the state of the soul' s longing to return to its. source. Rabbi Isaac Luria wrote of the soul as a spark of th e divine light, from which it had separated at the time of creation and wi th which it longs to be reunited. He spoke of the lower self as a kelipah, a \"shell\" or \"husk,\" that encases our souls, our holy spark. Although we are truly spiritual, our imprisonment in these shells prevents us from knowing and experienc ing our spiritual essence. The purpose of human life is to break the shells an d liberate the sparks, freeing them to reunite with the original, eternal light. This state of restoration was called tikkun -- \"redemption\" or \"perfection.\" The spiritual Master, the mystic, comes to this world to teach a method of freeing the soul -- the spark -- from the shell of mind and illusion, so it can me rge back into God. This is the real unification, or yoga. Some Kabbalists taught that each of the realms of Atziluth, Briah, Yetzir ah, and Assiah was made of respectively higher and lower intensities of all ten se firot. They envisioned the ten sefira of the world of Assiah as existing in the human body itself, with each sefirah corresponding to a particular function or energy center of the body. The Kabbalists used the image of the Tree of Life to describe the re lationship between the sefirot when manifested in the human body. In various Jewis h meditational practices, the tree serves as a diagram of the various steps or stations a practitioner needs to traverse in the course of his or her inner mystic journey to spiritual union. Similarly, Indian yogis and mystics describe a series of chakras or energy center in the body, upon which they meditate during certain prac tices of yoga. These chakras have a direct correspondence to the sefirot of the Tree of Life in the realm of Assiah (the Physical Plane). All saints teach that the creation came from the Word, the holy Name of God, th e Shabd -- the divine energy of life, the divine music, the audible life st ream -- which activates the creation and manifests as sound and light, emanating from En-S of -- the realm of pure Spirit."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The goal of spiritual practice is to reverse this process of creation on an i ndividual level -- of the soul's separation from the divine source and imprisonmen t in matter. Jewish mystics call it tikkun, \"fixing,\" but Indian mystics simply des cribe it as the merging of the soul into its divine source, so that it never again has to experien ce separation and imprisonment in the material creation. The purpose of the creation cannot be understood at the level of intellect . The causal, astral and physical planes are composed of spirit mixed with varying degr ees of matter, and thus are subject to change and disintegration. They are not etern al or true; love exists in limited quantities there, but negativity is also pr esent. In Judaism, man is said to have two inclination or impulses: the good inclination (soul) and the evil inclination (mind and body/desire nature). What is good or evi l can be distinguished easily, for one either moves closer to or further sway from the Lord. Since the Lord, the pure spiritual being, is light, to obscure that light r esults in what we call evil. Though in many respects evil is only a lesser good an there is no such things as evil per se...it is but a show, a lesser light. Whatever pulls us away fr om the Lord and realizing Him within us is evil; whatever leads us toward Him is good. Just as there is one Lord for everyone, so the soul which is His essence, is one and the same in everyone. Though our bodies may differ, the spiritual essenc e that activates it and gives us life is the same. We must get in touch with the divi ne Name He has placed within us all. When you examine the grades closely, you find that Thought, Understanding, Voice, Utterance are all one and the same, and there is separation between them, and this is what is meant b the words: \"The Lord is one and His Name is One.\" --(Zohar). In the scriptures of all religions, prophets and mystics have used the t erms Name and Word to describe the divine power, the spiritual truth, the manife station of God in the creation -- sound and light within.

BIBLIOGRAPHY PREFACE ...the first Sefirah is Keter, the Crown, the begin ning, the primal void. In the beginning He created a point, which became Thought, where all the figures were drawn. He was and was not, encompassed in the name, having as yet no name other than the desire to be called by a nam e. . . . He traced signs in the air; a dark light leapt from His most secret de pth, like a colorless mist that gives form to formlessness, and the flames str eamed down to illuminate the lower Sefirot, and down, down to the Kingdom. ...In the second Sefirah the dark aleph changes int o the luminous aleph. From the Dark Point spring the letters of the Torah . The consonants are the body, the vowels the breath, and together they accompany the worshipper as he chants. When the chant moves, the consonants are the body, the vowels the breath, and together they acco mpany the worshipper as he chants. When the chant moves, the consonants and vowels move with it, and from them rises Hokmah--wisdom, knowle dge, the primordial thought that contains, as in a box, everything, all will unfold in creation. Hokmah holds the essence of all that will emanate f rom it. Binah is the palace Hokmah builds as He spreads out from the primordial point. If Hokmah is the source, Binah is the river that flows from it, separating into its various branches until they all empty into the great sea of the last Sefirah. But in Binah all for ms are already formed. ...Hesed is not only the Sefirah of grace and love. ..it is also the moment of expansion of the divine substance, which spreads out to the edge of infinity. It is the care of the living for the dead , but someone also must have observed that it is the care of the dead for t he living. --Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" THE TREE OF LIFE Iona Miller, ©1980 According to scenarios imagined by modern theorists , \"the universe originated in a cosmic fluctuation, in which pure energy condensed into matter.

The oldest-known practi ce of this technique of meditation was known as Merkabah Mysticism, allegedly develop ed by the Jewish Patriarch, Abraham. It is a regeneration meditation for immortali ty. THE DIAMOND BODY is examined from perspectives in Jungian psychology, fr om definitions in physics and Jewish mysticism. This is then synthes ized into the framework of Magick. There is an inherent spiritual aspect of matter, foun d in the nature of order and synchronous events. This spiritual aspect is explored t hrough the philosophical concepts known as the Philosopher's Stone A geometrical image is developed from solid state physics, corresponding t o both the Jewish mystical traditions and current concepts in Imaginal psychology. A mathematical model is generated to assist the development of anima cons ciousness via a visualization exercise of the diamond body. A resonance occurs between spe cific internal-state functions and the \"outside.\" These resonance relation ships are discussed and specific models are given to aid visualization and resonance . The use of these geometrical forms as Magickal tools offers intriguing poss ibilities. They allow experimental interaction with archetypes of God-forms. They also gr ant access to those specific altered states where one experiences the e ternal aspect of sacred time: A consciousness of immortality. THE DIAMOND BODY as an exer cise is a meditation form of the future. This practice of meditation develops a common ground, uniting psyche with matter. Through the stabilization and equilibrium fostered in the aspirant du ring mediation sessions, the individual is brought into increased harmony with the e nvironment. More important, a \"repair function\" is now available, one able to reverse those entropic functions related to libido. THE DIAMOND BODY is a breakthrough in meditation techniques, someth ing for the 21-Century. Steeped in mystery, the Merkabah Chariot of Sepher-Yetzirah , the BOOK OF FORMATION is also Ezekiel's vision: the Cube of Space. For the first time, a contemporary description of THE DIAMOND BODY is formulated using synergetics, cognitive sciences, phsycis, and metaphysics.

For when all is equilibrated, when all is beheld without all, there is joy, joy, joy that is but one facet of a diamond, every other facet whereof is more joyful than joy itself. Aleister Crowley, The Dragon-Flies SACRED GEOMETRY: According to most creation stories, out of primal Nothingness, the All or Everything emerges or emanates forth. Paradoxically, everything seems to come from noth ing. How does nothing become something? Energy \"crystallizes\" into matter in t he womb of empty space, a dynamic Void. Mass is simply a form of energy. Even inert objects are full of motion at the atomic and subatomic levels. The formation process is structured by an underlying, invisible, geometri cal lattice. Actually, it is pre-geometric. Because it has no true physical existence , it is metaphysical (beyond physics). This threshold of matter, where nothing b ecomes something, is of great philosophical interest. Actually, materialism (a natural philosophy) is a theory of metaphysics. It is metaphysical thinking to consider static matter as a primary reality. In fac t, any attempt to describe reality is metaphysical speculation. In its dynami c form matter cannot be separated from energy. Energy is a property of matter, which can be considered potential energy. The mystic believes in matter, but believes it is more than scienc e has yet discovered. Even before Western science began, mystics believed that mind, consci ousness, or spirit is a property of matter. It hardly matters, philosophically, if you consider it as manifesting force or manifesting spirit. The nature of reality is that matter-energy must be taken together. The t heory of relativity conceives of this single substance as a distortion of the struc ture of space. Physicist Ian Barbour writes that, \". ..in quantum theory, separate particles seem to be temporary and partial manifestations of a shifting pattern of waves that combine at on e point, dissolve again, and recombine elsewhere; a particle begins to look like a local outcropping of a continuous substratum of vibrational energy .\" That vibrational energy is governed by the laws of probability. But what subtle forces underlie matter-energy and space-time? All f orm and power are latent within the void. The Heart Sutra tells us that, \" Form is not other than Void, Void is not other than Form. \" This implies that our human form is not other than void, and biophysics shows this to be true. Our physical makeup is largel y emptiness."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"If we conceive of humans as being most fundamentally electromagnetic e ntities, instead of chemical beings, we can imagine our finer existence as dynamicall y interactive wave-fronts in space. Our personal \"space\" is not utterly e mpty, but cannot be conceived apart from our matter exhibiting itself in parti cular ways, i.e. as \"waves.\" The void state, or primal matrix, is \" cosmic zero, \" yet proportionately our most fundamental reality. It is part of the surrealistic quantum realm. It lie s within us all, for the relative space between our atoms is astronomical. This is synonymous w ith the ground state of existence which mystics seek in their meditation, m oving beyond mind and maya . It is that state of consciousness where outer perceptions cease, and consciousness is free to simply be. Throughout the centuries, various geometrical forms have been revered as expressions or metaphors of higher spiritual truths. These sacred for ms and symbols are a natural part of the collective consciousness which emerges in every generation. We project them outwardly from within our psyche because they ar e so fundamental to our existence. That apprehension is intuitive. Certain typ ical forms recur in meditation and ceremonial practice, worldwide. When something emerges from nothing, it does so via non-Euclidean geometry, coming to occupy space/time. Einstein used non-Euclidean geometry to e xplain the relativity of time and space as the geometry that is produced by matter or mat ter by geometry. The perception of the transcendental or metaphysical aspects of geometry is intuitive. There are examples of philosophical geometry or geometrical p hilosophy from around the world. These traditions are found in India, China, Egypt, and Great Britain, to name a few. Plato, Archimedes, and the Pythagoreans based much of their philosophical speculation around the nature of geometrical form, suggesting that mathemat ics and structural forms had ultimate status. Our modern science has nev er forsaken the tradition of seeking the understanding of forms that provide shap e and meaning to physical reality. Euclidean geometry describes the nature of the human s cale, but non-Euclidean models the cosmos and microcosm. More and more intricate forms of measurement became the basis of the scientific method. Eventually, th is led to modern topology--the study of those properties of geometric figures or soli d bodies that remain invariant under certain transformations. Heisenberg explained that, \" The elementary particles of modern physics can be transformed into each other exactly as in the philosophy of Plato. \" In \"sacred topology\", the relationships are more than metaphorical. Metaphysical and physi cal reality coincide. This is abundantly illustrated in R. Buckminster Fuller's geometrical tour de force, SYNERGETICS I & II . Fuller demonstrates, via synergetics, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, because of the relativity and dynamic tension of forces. In our universe, as more comple x systems are built up, new properties appear that were not foreshadowed by the part s alone. These emergent properties include life, conscious awareness, and b eauty."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Plato's Academy in Athens had a policy: \" You are not allowed to enter here, unless you know geometry. \" In the dialogue, Meno, Plato describes Socrates teaching geometry to a slave. In true Socratic form, he does not instruct him directly. R ather, he elicits knowledge from the slave which he did not know he possess ed. The diagrams themselves elicit the buried intuitive knowledge of a world inhabited by the gods and by the divine \"Forms.\" In Plato's view, before birth we were familiar with purely mathematical \" objects\" and relations, as well as moral ideals or values. He alleged that we lost this knowledge at birth, but can recover it through revelation. For Plato, the virtues paled in comparison with the highest capacity of the soul, which is the m ystical beholding of the eternal. Mystics tell us the divine is formless. Actual space is not empty, but the possibility has always been a controversi al problem in philosophy. Aristotle found the concept of a total void unacceptabl e. Scientists still cannot make a perfect experimental vacuum. Astronomy s hows us that matter is averagely distributed, with roughly as much matter betw een the stars as there is within them. Yet, there are large voids in space, with stars cl ustered on the outer edges of these bubbles of void. The preponderance is of volumes of empty space over volumes of matter. So, the characteristic feature of the universe is not matter, but seemi ngly empty space. Again, most of the interior of the atom is empty, as is the space occup ied by the galaxies, and the vast regions which separate them. Stars, atoms, and the vacuum are a seamless whole. The notion of the eternal nature of sacred emptiness is echoed in moder n quantum theory. This is not ordinary, but dynamic and receptive emptiness, which mas ks a seething ocean of virtual (non-observable) scalar fields and particles. The central concept in Quantum Field Theory is that of the field, which exists ever ywhere and everywhen. It is a field of curved space/time. Matter is not separate fro m its surrounding space. The field can take the form of quanta or particles. It i s the fundamental physical entity, the only physical reality. The field contains the potentiality of all possible states or conditions in the universe. Of these states, the most fundamental is the Ground State, (or \"vacuum state\"). Matter is rare in the universe. Most of it consists of a very volatile, excited, i onic plasma. Only 5% of matter is neither too hot, nor too dilute, to congeal as a solid, liquid, or gas. This form of matter is so rare it has been described as 'tr ace contaminants.' Those so-called trace contaminants constitute our very e ssence. Yet, some form of matter is essential to all activity. All matter is in moti on. Activity is the essence of being. From the \"cosmic zero\", everything--the tot ality of \"excited states\"--arises by creative processes. It is also the state into which eve rything subsides by absorption processes. Virtual particles are continuousl y popping into and out of existence."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"The ground state is characterized by the fact that it stretches to infin ity, uniform and changeless. It is the same everywhere and everywhen because of the iden tity of space/time. Within the universal field the values of the ground state and e xcited states are all one. An unlimited amount of particles come into being and vani sh endlessly. Matter is thus a temporary manifestation of the Void, an extrusion of the Void. The so-called \"cosmic zero\" was modeled by geometer/philosopher Fulle r in the figure he called Vector Equilibrium, (V.E.). It might actually claim to be the first \"Buckyball,\" the one Fuller himself described. This geometry is the precursor of the new elemental 'Fullerenes.' The V.E. geometry has been recognized for a l ong time. It was one of the thirteen Archimedian solids, the cuboctahedron. But the Greeks were fascinated with regular forms whose faces were all the same, such as the cube. They failed to understand the delicate balancing act th e cuboctahedron symbolizes. They simply did not notice that Vector Equil ibrium is pristine equanimity because they were looking elsewhere. The Greek s never really comprehended the energic or energetic properties of Vector Equil ibrium, i.e. dynamic stability. The couldn't conceive of the internal dynamics of stabil ization, synergetics. They had a static, non-relativistic view of natural philosophy. It remained for Fuller to assert that, \" zero pulsation in the Vector Equilibrium is the nearest approach we will ever know to eternity and god. \" The conceptual model is the closest our minds and senses can come to that cosmic realization, short of mystical revelation. Mind alone cannot fathom the depth of this Void. Geometry is a construct of the intellect. The V.E. center is primal \"emptiness.\" It does not exist in Nature, becau se nature never pauses at, but merely transforms through, this state. It is a mathemat ical anomaly where the normal laws of the space/time continuum break down. It is not a symbol of ultimate order. It looks like a very rational, orderly system, but it i s ultimately irrational. It defies logic. V.E. is the breeder of wave-partic le duality, the uncertainty principle, and non-locality at the quantum level. It is a zone of neutral resonance where waves can pass through waves without interference, accor ding to Fuller. Yet, it never physically exists as a structure, since nature abhors a vacuum. In quantum mechanics a system can never have an energy of exactly zero. There is no such thing as absolute emptiness. However, the minimal motion of the grou nd state is called zero point energy, or zero point motion. Cosmic zero exists, paradoxically, in the realm of the psyche (our conceptualization) and in quant um reality in the atomic nucleus expressed as force. It is the form of formle ssness, the root metaphor. It also forms the celestial roots of the cosmic Tree of Life, s ince there is a fine-to-non-existent line between organic and inorganic matter on the quantum scale. Physics is the patterns of organic energy, all of which are dynamic, alive. Mass is energy, so the subatomic world is always restlessly in motion. Inert matter is full of motion when we look closely at it. The activity of matter is its essence."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Vector Equilibrium emanates/condenses from a center in twelve fu ndamental directions. This emergent energy moves outward through space/time in th e form of a cuboctahedron, alternating with its mathematical reciprocal, an octahedron - within-a-cube. It is a truncated cube with 50 symmetrically positioned topological features. Vector Equilibrium has the same surface area as a sphere, yet c ontains no volume, i.e. it contains \"nothing.\" The Vector Equilibrium system has 12 vertices, 8 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 32 planes. It is omnidirectional equilibrium, symbolically and physically s peaking. As such, it is a perfect symbol for \"holding the tension of the opposites,\" or \" uniting the opposites.\" Yet, it is more than a metaphor. It is an archetypal image whi ch bridges the macrocosm with the microcosm. It is a living example of the H ermetic Axiom, \" As Above, So Below ,\" uniting spiritual and literal reality. V.E. makes it possible to make conceptual models of other dimensions (hyperspace), mathematically and mystically. In the V.E. figure, equilibrium between positive and negative is zero. It is the equalization of the forces of push/pull, radiation/gravitation, or tension/compression. Fuller alleged it \" represents the limits of the mind's ability to conceptualize 'in' .\" For Fuller, all of space/time is undergird with a pre-geometric matrix, which is an infinite field of vector equilibria. An entire un iverse can be seeded from one V.E., self-generating to fill all space/time. There may be no ultimate physical building-block of matter, but there is one single entity that u ndergirds and composes everything in the universe, according to Fuller. The basic ele ment of the universe is dynamic patterns. This field constitutes a \"cosmic blueprint\" which Fuller call ed the Isotropic Vector Matrix (I.V.M.), a living continuum. The allocation of divinity to this \"mother of all fields\" marks its archetypal character. As a variation on the theme of Celes tial Goddess, it symbolizes the embodiment of nature. Like a modern Isis, it iterates the theme of the underlying, inseparable cosmic web or net, connecting all. The living Void gives birth to all phenomenal forms. It pulsates with the rh ythm of creation and destruction of material particles. Another goddess, Nuit, is the essence of Infinite Space. She is infinite energy density pervading the entir e cosmos. She is the receptivity of the void to the wavelength of radiation. Adjusting the geom etry of the void influences the propagation of radiation. The goddess Ma-at, or Balance, is another expression of the same universal V.E. energy. The Upanishads identifies Brahman with the void: \" Brahman is life. Brahman is joy. Brahman is the Void. Joy, verily, that is the same as the Void. The Void, verily , that is the same as joy .\" The geometry of Vector Equilibrium is inferred from that of closest-p acked spheres of equal radius. It just happens to be the geometry which underlies all m atter since it is found in the nucleus of all atoms as sub-atomic force. Here, in the int erior of atoms, Newtonian physics does not apply. This is a probabilistic, acausal world. Here synchronicity prevails over chronicity."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"This uniform geometrical field, with the property of Divine conscious ness, is the basis for a geometrical model of reality spanning the abyss between the metaphysical and the physical. It is not the first model in history to attem pt to do so. There is an ancient geometrical model which shares a common framework with the Vector Equilibrium. THE GEOMETRY OF THE QABALA The ancient mystical system of the Qabala is formulated around the geometri cal glyph known as the Tree of Life. This sacred geometry system came down to u s through Judaism and Hermetic Philosophy. It is one of the main currents of t hought in the Western Occult Tradition. A mathematically accurate image of the T ree of Life can be constructed by dividing a vertical line into four equal length s and filling in four intersecting circles, using a fourth of the line as radius. The nexus points are the positions of the 10 spheres, and connecting paths join the centers of th e spheres. The Geometrical Construction of the Tree of Life"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The spheres represent states of consciousness or ways of being, while the paths are ways of transition or change. It symbolizes all ways of being and becoming. Like t he quantum field, it contains the potentiality of all possible states or condi tions in the universe. It is just the ancient way of saying it, and it turns out to be phys ically provable. The ancient model coincides with state-of-the-art physics. T he 10 spheres and 22 paths yield a total of 32 planes of reference, like the Vector Equilibri um. This \"tree\" was first described in writing in the Sephir Yetzirah , or The Book of Formation. Legend says the book came to Abraham, from God, through an angel. Today, we might say it was \"channeled\" from a divine source. Jewish scholar, Gershom Scholem dates the work around the third to sixth century. However, t here is some astronomical evidence that the system does date from the time of Abraham, approximately 4,000 years ago. Whether the patriarch was the first to receive the revelation, or not, th is archetypal consciousness map encodes a system of spiritual wisdom and growth in geo metrical form. It describes the nature of the universe, consciousness, and the cr eation. It seems to have intuitively anticipated the discovery of the physical nature of reality. The glyph itself was used as a meditation devise by students of the Qabala, an oral wisdom tradition. One aim of the qabalists was to see the Tree always, everywhe re, in everything. Another essential doctrine of Qabala is that humans possess a \" spirit body\" that can detach itself from the physical body and ascend to higher plane s. Most modern students of Qabala are familiar with the standard 2-dimensi onal representation of the Tree, which is drawn \"flat,\" even though the circ les are always conceived of as spheres. There is also a long tradition of a so-called 4-dimensi onal Tree of Life diagram, based on The Book of Formation. This geometrical figure consists of two interfacing pyramids surrounding a central core, within an enclosing cube. This octahedron-within-a-cube happens to be the crystal structure of diamond, a face-centered-cubic lattice. Recalling that Abraham is also the patriar ch of the Moslems, it is interesting to note reference to a spiritual body, a \"diam ond body\", in the writing of Shaikh Amad Ahsa'i from the 13th century. Speaking of a sub stance akin to that of the medieval Philosopher's Stone, he equated the \"diamond bo dy\" with the \"Resurrection Body\" of the faithful believer in the Paradi se of the future Aeon. For the Qabalists, meditation on this figure provided a mystical body as a vehicl e for consciousness in imaginal space. This diamond body was used during m editation to enter the inner court of Divinity, symbolized by the center of the fi gure. Here the Beginning and End of time are co-temporaneous, space ceases to be a hind rance, and the mystic beheld the ecstatic vision of the Lord on His Throne. The geo metry was a \"gateway\" to another dimension of experience. This Alpha-Omega point has all the physical qualities of Vector Equilibr ium. The ancient meditation practice was known as Merkabah mysticism, and those wh o"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"practiced it called themselves, \"Riders in the Chariot.\" They claimed to see into the future. This insinuates that the figure is a \"vehicle\" for moving consci ousness through imaginal time and space. It seems to be a metaphysical \"time mach ine,\" or inter-dimensional gateway. As in most design or mandala meditations, the aspirant pictures him or he rself at the center of the figure through visualization, contemplation, and identif ication. Through this process of centering, these mystics came to know themse lves and God. Perhaps they learned, as Fuller later discovered, of the unusual anomalous conditions of perfect equilibrium. This meditation provided a speci fic technique for escaping from time. Its realization meant instantaneous enlightenme nt, a paradoxical leap out of Time. It facilitates transcendence. Occultist, Paul Foster Case published an array of this type in his book, The Tarot (1947). Aware of the ancient mystic practice, he included the figure in his study of Qabala, calling it alternately the Key of the Cosmos and Numbers, or the Cube of Space. Again, we have the form of the octahedron-within-a-cube. Vector Equilibrium and the Cube of Space are mathematical duals, or reciprocal s of one another. They \"jitterbug\" back and forth as the figure grows outward to fill al l space. They are two ways of looking at the same geometrical phenomena. "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Case pointed out that its construction was based on the six-pointed Star of David, (or Shield of David), also known as \"The Star of the Macrocosm.\" His descriptor s of zero as a sacred, empty, consciousness field reiterate the qualities of Vector Equilibrium. Zero is a symbol of the absence of quality, quantity, or mass. Thus it denotes absolute freedom from every limitation whatever. it is a sign of the infi nite and eternal Conscious Energy, itself No-Thing, though manifest in every thing. It is That which was, is, and shall be forever; but it is nothing we can name. Boundless infinitely potential, living light, it is the rootless root of all things, of all activities, of all modes of consciousness. In it are included all imaginabl e and unimaginable possibilities, but it transcends them all. The Qabalists cal l it: (a) No-Thing; (b) The Boundless; (c) Limitless Light. Pure Conscious En ergy, above and beyond thought, to us it is Superconsciousness. With their fascination for completely regular figures, the Greeks devi sed a way of establishing XYZ coordinates within a cube. Our science and method of ori entation has been stuck with that model ever since. However, nature's own most ec onomical coordination is in triangles and tetrahedra, rather than squares or cubes. Vector Equilibrium is more in line with modern Quantum Mechanic al models than the Newtonian XYZ. It expresses more degrees of freedom. Cubes are i nherently unstable; they lack tensegrity. The Greeks modeled on them because the y were used to using stone blocks. So, close examination of the underlying geometry of the Tree of Life reveals that the ancients were not lacking a very deep intuitive awareness of the true stru cture of matter and the universe. It may have been pre-conscious, rather than consc ious, but it was correct. The underlying geometrical matrix of the multi-dimens ional Tree is, in fact, Vector Equilibrium. To find the commonality--the harmony--the figure of the V.E. must be subjected to a transformation process, i.e. rotation. To bring the two figures into synch, simply rotate the V.E. to any edge of its containing cube. If the 3-dimensional V.E. is drawn flat, the inherent geom etry of the Tree of Life is immediately revealed, including some of the so-called \"hidden\" paths. A symbolic representation of the optimal union of opposites, it means in psychological terms, \"holding the tension of the opposites.\" This is the essence of the Tree of Life. The theme of union of dynamic op posites has reverberated down through the ages. It was the process/goal of alchemy, creati on of the Philosopher's Stone. Now, Jungian psychology carries the torch of this philosophical pursuit. Both Vector Equilibrium and the Tree of Lif e express this most elegantly and economically in terms of minimal graphic elements. insert picture c tree of life By combining the vectors of a V.E. nested within a cube, it is possible to der ive the nexus points on which to construct the entire Tree of Life. In The Anatomy of the Body of God, (1925), Frater Achad, (magickal name of Charles Stansfield Jones),"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"revealed an amplified Tree of Life projecting from a center in six dire ctions. Rather than a flat depiction, his revelation showed Trees radiating in the four car dinal directions, plus up and down. This is another variation on the theme of XYZ coordinates. Yet, V.E. can be shown, once again, to be the skeletal matrix on whic h the figure congeals. The geometrical duals yield all the necessary nexus poi nts to form the entire Tree of Life, including the 11th mystery sphere, Daath. A chad's advice for modern Qabalists says, ...since the \"Tree\" is everywhere the same in every part of space, once its general attributions are fixed in the mind, it is not well to confuse ourse lves by too much attempt at progressed expansion of the idea. Rather we would return and contemplate the Centre from which All proceeds, thus obtaining the Pu re Essence Here and Now. This concept of a self-generating, self-iterating, all-space filling, crys talline system seems to herald the modern discovery of the fractal nature of the univer se. Whether we look at the macrocosmic, mesocosmic, or microcosmic level, we find the sa me principle operating. By following any portion of the consciousness map \"backwards\" and \"downwards\" to the center, we have a conceptual means of entering that most pristine state of consciousness where All become s No-Thing. ."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"GEOMETRICAL IN-SIGHT: These systems are virtually pre-geometrical. They don't really exist in nat ure, per se. Yet they are the invisible lattice, or bare bones, of our physical and sp iritual life, of all life and manifestations. In this pre-geometry we have a blueprint for the formation of all matter, all form. This is the geometry of closest-packed sphe res in the nucleus of the atom. Yet, Vector Equilibrium is more than an expression of nuclear forces . It is \"an endlessly interlinked chain of atomically self-renewing links of omn i-equal strength or of an omni-directionally interlinked chain matrix of ever renewed atomic li nks ,\" according to Fuller. No single configuration of matter persists inde finitely. All is change and recombination. V.E. describes the most economical lines of move ment within the atomic nucleus. And, it also is the structural matrix of a very an cient and sophisticated consciousness-changing technology. Through it we rememb er deep knowledge of our true nature. Noting the metaphysical aspect of physics, physicist Wolfgang Pauli said, \" We should now proceed to find a neutral, or unitarian, language in which every conce pt we use is applicable as well to the unconscious as to matter, in order to overcome t his wrong view that the unconscious psyche and matter are two things.\" We have, in the V.E. model, a language or information transfer system that bridges both the physical and the spiritual. Fuller says, \" In this model the physical and metaphysical share the same design .\" The mundane and supernatural share the same design: \" As Above, So Below .\" It creates a mystical revelation described as ecstatic, blissful, joyful, transcendental. Goethe's Faust opens with the mage contemplating the qabalistic, geome tric design of the Macrocosm: What jubilation bursts out of this sight Into my senses--now I feel it flowing, Youthful, a sacred fountain of delight, Through every nerve, my veins are glowing.

All weaves itself into the whole, Each living in the other's soul. How heaven's powers climb up and descend. Passing the golden pails from hand to hand! Bliss-scented, they are winging Through sky and earth--their singing Is ringing through the world. To know ourselves is to know the nature of cosmos. The yogis and masters tell us that matter is mind or consciousness at its most fundamental or gross leve l. Now scientists are saying essentially the same thing. In Aion, psychologist Carl Jung reiterates the identity of psyche and matter: Psyche cannot be totally different from matter, for how otherwise could it move matter? And matter cannot be alien to psyche, for how else could matter produce psyche? Psyche and matter exist in the same world, and each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal action would be impossible. From the dawn of history mankind has employed sacred geometries for metaphysical orientation and creating consciousness maps. Most maps of the psyche imply a \"journey\" either to the heights or depths of experience. Long ago Heracl itus alleged, and mystic artist William Blake agreed, that the way up and the way down are one and the same. Metaphysical models usually speak of an ascent to utopian heights or \"inner planes.\" Psychological models are usually concerned with descents into th e subconscious depths and use subterranean imagery. These depths wer e the familiar territory of shamans for millennia. Both the occult and transpersonal psyc hology models include heights and depths of human experience. Maslow introd uced the concept of \" peak experiences \" to psychology. We may have the erroneous idea that peaks, or heights, or \"highs\" are \"good.\" This is mainly because we are enculturated to strive upward. This is only one of a myriad of states of consciousness, and it belongs to manically over-achieving heroic ego. Negatively directed, this same energy can produce an all-time high in a soci opath or criminally insane personality, during a heinous act. All that is \"up\" is not \"good\"; and, all that is \"down\" is not \"evil.\" This misapprehension is the root of the notion of a spirit/matter duality, where all matter is inherently \"evil\". In this belief system, \"we exist: therefore w e are sinful.\" Yet, our heights and depths contain the first-hand experiential knowledge that 'we are one.'"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"This old system of orientation and modeling the universe, with its ascents and descents of the soul, was adequate for many years. However, for the modern individual, with a consciousness that is not earth-bound, the old hierarc hical model is no longer the best metaphor. Today we are not confined to the spectrum of real ity dictated solely by our finite senses. We are directly aware of physical realities ranging from the sub-atomic to t he cosmic. Our perceptions are amplified with technology. New ways of seei ng lead to new philosophical perspectives. We can align our mystical worldview wit h physical reality. The true nature of physical reality remains a mystery. Even for physic ists, it has an elusive quality. No one really knows just what a quantum, a photon, or an atom \"really is\" or what it is doing when we're not looking at it. Physics is another interpretation of reality. We have become aware of a vast physical dimension without and an equally vast realm of psyche within. The y are available for exploration. And there are ancient and modern technologies whic h aid us here. In terms of modern orientation and consciousness models, an omnidirectional system allows more degrees of freedom. This freedom i s a conceptual, imaginal, and physical reality. Buckminster Fuller said that in whole systems the directions ar e always out and in. \"In and out are the relevant directions, not up and down.\" Models or maps bas ed on \"in and out\", rather than \"up and down\", allow us to conceive of particu lar states or conditions. As a metaphor, \"in and out\" is a typical characteristi c of the phase states of matter. It is either in or out of phase or synchronization. Duri ng observation, matter is either in solid physical existence (particle) or out of solid physical existence (wave). This wave-particle duality exists within us all. This uncertainty s urrounding substantive existence leads to paradox. We cannot grasp one part of nature without another part slipping through our fingers. Photons, neutrons, and even atoms have no definite form until they are measured. Wave-particle duality is a myster y. However, this primal characteristic of atoms, and the energy exchange in the ir cores, is the basis of our physical existence. The emergence of stable ma tter requires the balancing of tendencies toward implosion and explosion. This is the f unction of Vector Equilibrium. Physicist David Bohm modeled an \"in and out\" universe of implicate (in) an d explicate (out) order. Yogis focus on the in and out breath during pranayama, and the experience connects them with cosmic time. The psychological te ndencies, introversion and extroversion, express the polarity in ways of being. In cybern etics there is input (I) and output (O), the direction of the signal deter mining if it is I/O or O/I. Vector Equilibrium is the most economical model using geometry t o express the ultimate union of the opposites. It creates the paradoxical state that is n either in nor out, up nor down, neither this nor that. For Fuller, the balancing of the tension of the opposites was achieved in h is tensegrity sphere. It is stabilized dynamically to neither explode nor col lapse. This"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"original \"Buckyball\" is a tangible example of Vector Equilibrium. Accordi ng to Fuller, \"matter\" itself is a contained explosion, and the Vector Equili brium is its austere image. It is a system not a structure. It underlies structure or formation of something from apparent \"nothingness.\" Vector Equilibrium is the lattice or invisible framework, and its bl ueprint is the cuboctahedron. Its explicit form can enfold on itself until it compact s down into an octahedron, then a tetrahedron, the prime geometrical form. This is accom plished by doubling up on the vectors on the edges. This creates the difference , for example, between carbon, diamond, and silicon atomic structures. They are all face-c entered cubic crystals. Coincidentally these elements are symbolic icons in our culture. They are the hallmarks of technology. A simple way to visualize the Vector Equilibrium is through the closes t packing of spheres which underlies the geometry of crystal formation. Imagine a clus ter of ping pong balls glued together, 12 around 1, then building out further and further . If you imagine vectors connecting the centers of each ball, in the third layer you can find the Vector Equilibrium. The vectors that radiate out from the center are exactly equal to the vect ors that bond the faces. No other structure can make this claim. This is the symm etry the Greeks missed, because it is an energetic process, manifesting force , not a thing. Vectors are not points in space traveling through time. Vectors map ener gy events. Time determines a vector's length--the time it takes an energy event t o happen. There must be time for wave functions to propagate. We know a musical note requires time to exist, because a note is nothing in an instant. Time is a duration. If we ask ourselves \"a duration of what?\", we can only answer \"...of nothing, or something.\" All \"somethings\" are composed of matter, and the nature of matter is consciousness. So time becomes a duration of consciousn ess. Energy is substance. Substance is energy at the quantum level. Our subst ance is energy, and consciousness is fully capable of quantum leaps. Fuller's energy mapping uses energetic triangles, in which three li nes are not just lying there but are busy stabilizing the angles opposite them. Fuller d escribes the dynamic domain of \"reality\" as a broad spectrum of energy events, across a small portion of which our senses can \"tune.\" Vector Equilibrium allows u s to conceptually, metaphorically, and spiritually bridge the abyss between the mystical and scientific perspectives through sacred geometry. It is a key to the i mplicate and explicate order. We should now proceed to find a neutral, or unitarian, language in which every concept we use is applicable as well to the unconscious as to matter , in order to overcome this wrong view that the unconscious psyche and matter are two things. --Professor Wolfgang Pauli"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"I. PHILOSOPHY: ROMANCING THE STONE A. THE PRACTICE OF ALCHEMY In the alchemical search for the God-head in matter, Paracelsus cont ended that matter was a living counterpart of the creating deity. A system of correspond ences is the foundation of alchemy. The conception of a primal event manifested in different fields is fundamental to alchemy. The process in the retort vessel i s analogous to the process of transformation of the psyche. Through alchemy, we can perceive the parallels between macrocosm and microcosm, universe and man. The metaphorical perception of alchemy grew in the Jungian school of psyc hology. It emphasizes the process of psychological transformation, or individuation . The model of the vector equilibrium matrix restores a physical basis to the c oncept of the Philosopher's Stone. This renews the alchemical philosophy which is, like Jungian psychology, concerned with the union of psyche and matter. There are three primary aspects of alchemy: 1. Alchemy as theory, is a comprehensive philosophical vision of the cosmos, built on the universal correspondence system. 2. Alchemy as practice may be viewed as a creative discipline, an art-form, involving one in the imaginal realm of soul-making. 3. Alchemy, as a transcendental search or quest, has the primary goal of liberation from the world. This is the knowledge of immortality, through t he union of opposites. Paracelsus described alchemy as the voluntary action of man in harmony with the involuntary action of nature. If the center of the creative process takes pl ace in the \"heart of man\", his intentions take on profound significance. They can now af fect, or influence, the destinies of the cosmos. Attainment of this state is k nown as the production of the Philosopher's Stone or Diamond Body. B. THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT OF THE IMMORTAL BODY The Philosopher's Stone may be equated with the Causal Body, the Resurre ction Body, or the Immortal Body. It is a vehicle for consciousness to inhabit, whic h is qualitatively different than the Astral Body, a double of the physical body. Alchemy strives for the experience of spiritual rebirth through the union of opposites, or the sacred marriage. The Philosopher's Stone is also a symbol of the embryonic Self. It is the product of the sacred marriage, which has been characterized in alchemy as the union of the Sun (+) and the Moon (-). Polarized positions, or extremes, may be symbolized variously as positive-ne gative, male-female, god-devil, spirit-matter, mother-father, etc. This marr iage creates a bond by which opposites are united in an image which transcends both or iginal"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"potentials. The whole art of alchemy is contained within the image of a magical or divine child. One of the alchemical goals is to create an eternal body for post-mortal conti nuation of the spirit and the soul. Both the western and Chinese alchemists f elt this could be accomplished in a lifetime, with the help of God, or the Self. This vess el for immortality is the Diamond Body. Alchemy, like Jungian psychology, is a creative discipline which embraces all things from the standpoint of soul. C. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE There is an inherent paradox in alchemy: all the while stressing redemp tion of the physical body, or matter, alchemy is actively striving toward creation of a subtle, immortal body, which has no apparent physical basis. This central problem in alchemy is the spiritual redemption of the p hysical body. Alchemy requires resurrection of the soul of body. The challenge one en counters is to \"see through\" to a unified vision of mundane physical processes with sp iritual values. This develops an awareness of the ordering processes inherent in matter. The solution is to visualize the physical as a metaphor for psychic transformat ion. Close scrutiny of the foundations of matter ought to reveal some physical analog ies to this 'archetype of the spiritual essence inherent in matter.' In al chemy, matter is perceived as a living feminine counterpart of the spiritual father or cre ator-god. It is an equivalent, not subordinate, principle. In THE COMMENTARIES OF AL , Aleister Crowley corresponded matter with the goddess Nuit. In other disciplines, Nuit is known as Sapientia Dei, Sophia, Shakti , Isis, Shekinah, etc. In alchemy, she is represented by the Anima Mundi, or World Soul. Nuit, as matter, is the feminine form of Godhead. Inherent in this wor d 'matter' are the concepts of matrix or lattice; and mater, the mothe ring womb. This implies a possible dovetailing of traditional attributes of Nuit with s pecific geometrical systems which operate at the atomic level. O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever th us; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art conti nuous!(1) Nuit, as 'zero' or 'naught' represents the field of potentiality.(2) By def inition, She may not be represented concretely, or be observed directly and finally. H er presence, however, may be inferred. Microphysics, by feeling its way into the \"unknown\" side of matter, parallel s the quest of the alchemist. The goal is toward a unified field theory, an all-e ncompassing model between subatomic and cosmological states of matter."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"An analysis of crystals in microphysics (solid state physics) might provi de a basis for unifying the philosophical and physical concepts regarding matter. This geometry can describe a system or matrix of unfoldment, bridging the microverse t o the cosmos. The geometry or matrix description of a crystal can act as a \"lens.\" This \"lens \" enables one to \"see\" or focus a projection of the physical state of matter into i ts spiritual counterpart. Alchemy is the means of \"seeing the Philosopher's Stone\", itself; i t is also a means of \"seeing through\" the Stone. As such, it is a form of metaphorical percepti on. The Stone is produced by the transformation in one's own psyche. The Philosopher's Stone, seen as a magic crystal, is not a spiritual or psychol ogical state, but more a magickal tool or universally applicable instrument of magi c. One can attain the ultimate mystical experience through proper application of the Stone. The Stone possesses the \"virtue\" or healing power to influence or trans form things. The process of making the Philosopher's Stone is a repitition of the crea tion myth via imagery. The imagery reverses the evolutional direction. It begins wit h animal images, then proceeds through images of plant life to more fundamental form s. The final goal is symbolized by metal, stone, or crystal. This language usually presents the ego in a direct line of confrontation and covenant with a single self, represented by images of unity (mandalas, crys tals, balls, wise men, and other patterns of order). But according to Jung the self has many archetypal instances. The puzzling relation between self and the archetypes reproduces the ancient enigma of the many-in-the-one and the one- in-the-many.(3) The alchemical concept of the Stone accomodates either/both a monothei stic attitude (where God is One), or a polytheistic viewpoint (which recognizes the v alue of the differentiation among archetypal figures). When we can distinguish among di vine figures, mythic creatures, and the phenomenal world, we may orient ourselve s in the imaginal realm. The process of alchemy takes place within cetain boundary conditions. It is visualized as occuring within a vessel (i.e. a containing form or matrix). Consciousness and life must be intensified or contained by focusin g one's attention. The process of reversal signifies reunion with the unconscious law s of our being. These laws also affect the formation of matter on quantum levels (in th e subatomic world of protons, neutrons, electrons, etc.). The purpose of alchemy is real-I-zation of the many aspects of the Univers e. The vessel contains and co-ordinates the manifold of psychic contents.

SOLID STATE PHYSICS: A study of the physical properties of the solid state, viewed as a branch of at omic physics, began in the early years of this century. Solid state physics has co me to mean the study of crystals and of electrons in crystal structures. A cent ury ago the study of crystals was concerned only with the external form of the crystal an d geometrical symmetry relationships, which described the physic al properties. Many crystalline minerals and gems, particularly quartz have been known and described for several thousand years. One of the earliest drawings of a cryst al appears in a Chinese pharmacopeia of the eleventh century A.D. The word cryst al itself referred only to quartz until the late middle ages when the w ord acquired a more general meaning. A.L. Seeber(1) of Freiburg suggested in 1824 that the elementary building b locks of crystals were small spheres. He proposed an empirical law of interatomic f orce with both attractive and repulsive regions. This model mathematically caused a latt ice array to be the stable equilibrium state of a system of identical atoms. Linus Pauling updated this idea in an article entitled \" The Close-Packed-Spheron Theory of Nuclear Fission \" (SCIENCE, Vol. 150, 1965, 297-305). He discovered that the arrangement of spherons (nuclear constituents) are roughly spheric al in shape and packed in concentric layers. They have intimate connection with cert ain Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and icosahedron). He also f ound that \"resonances\" enter into the dynamics of nuclear constituents. An ideal crystal is constructed by the infinite regular repetition in space of identical structural units in the form of parallelpipeds. In the simplest crys tals such as copper, silver, gold and the alkali metals the structural unit contains a s ingle atom. More generally the structural unit contains several atoms or molecules , up to perhaps 100 in an inorganic crystal and 10/5 in protein crystals. We describe the structure of all crystals in terms of a single periodic lattice. A group of atoms is attached to each lattice point situated in each elementary parall elpiped. This group of atoms is called the basis; the basis is repeated in space to form the crystal. There are fourteen Bravis or space lattices possible. The diamond structure is the densest pack of atoms. The space lattice of a diamond is a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.). A primiti ve basis of two identical atoms at 0-0-0;1/4-1/4-1/4 is associated with each lattice point. Th e tetrahedral bonding of the diamond structure has four nearest neighb ors, and twelve nearest neighbors. There are eight atoms in a unit cube. The Diamond lattice is relatively empty. The maximum proportion of the availab le volume which may be filled by hard spheres is only 0.34, or about 46 percent of the filling factor for a closest-packed structure. Carbon, silicon, germani um, and grey"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"tin crystallize in the diamond structure. The diamond structure is t he result of covalent bonding. In covalence an atom shares electrons with surrounding atom s. Two atoms sharing a pair of electrons makes a bond. B. THE VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM MATRIX: The vector equilibrium matrix, as discussed by Buckminster Full er (2) in SYNERGETICS 1 and 2, describes the most economical lines of movement within the atomic nucleus. These are the preferred pathways for energy exchan ge, because they are the paths of least resistance. The equilibrium point between + and - is zero. The vector equilibrium is a true zero reference point for energeti c mathematics, according to Fuller. The vector equilibrium modelling is important for conceptualization in philosophy and quantum physics. It is a graphic depiction of the nuclear tendencie s to implosion and explosion. These forces are mathematically reversible, an d always in exact balance. This zero point is never directly observed as physical experience. This i s reflected, perhaps, in mystical thought by the phrase, \" I am Isis; no man hath lifted my veil. \" We can see no further into nature than fluctuating fields of energy whic h constitute the constant background motion. All that is, is in motion. But it is sustained by the ground state or \"cosmic zero.\" The vector equilibrium matrix is a system, not a structure. When the god dess Nuit is corresponded with the vector equilibrium matrix, She may be seen as nu clear nothingness. This Goddess of infinite Space is the zero point, where wave s pass through waves without interference lines. She is the womb from whic h all that is born in materiality emanates forth. This vectoral phase or mathematical zone of neutral resonance occurs bet ween the outwardly pushing electromagnetic wave propagation and inwardly pulling gravitational coherence. The specific crystal structure represents t he state of equilibrium in bonding. The vector equilibrium matrix is the mat hematical description of this zone of neutral resonance. The diamond structure, using Seeber's small sphere model, packs toge ther the most compact spheres of equal radius. This f.c.c. pack produces the densest form of matter, the diamond.

There is no atom at this point as this is the zero point of equilibration. V isualize the three tetrad axes of the cube, XYZ coordinates, which join the center s of the six plane faces.

This yields a figure with the following properties: 12 vertices 8 triangular faces 6 square faces 24 edges = 50 symmetrically positioned topological features The synthesis of psychological opposites contained in the figure of the V.E.M. is quite interesting. It is composed of the minimal number of graphic el ements required to depict the relationship of '3' and '4'. The figure shows the relationship between a threefold process and a fo urfold goal. Deity, or godhead, is expressed in symbolism by triangles. The soul is depict ed in its static quaternity form by the squares. Three symbolizes an essentially monotheistic process, the total cycle of growth and dynamic change. While four is structural wholeness in its eternal aspec t. Four shows the static, stabilizing influence of the polytheistic psyche. Neither 3 nor 4 alone are an adequate symbol of wholeness. The quaternity alone is not an adequate symbol for totality as the dynamic, developmental, and temporal aspect is lacking. In other words, fourness may not be actualized without su bmitting to the threefold process of realization in time. Psychologist Edward Edinger comments on Jung's view: Jung does not consider the quaternity a completely adequate symbol for totality. Rather a union of quaternity with trinity in a more complete synthesis is required...The theme of twelve, for instance, includes both three and four in i ts factors. The trinity archetype seems to symbolize individuation as a process, whi le the quaternity symbolizes its goal or completed state. Three is the number of egohood; four is the number of wholeness, the Self. But since individuation is never truly complete, each temporary state of completion or wholeness mus t be submitted once again to the dialectic of the trinity in order for life to go on.(3) The Vector Equilibrium Matrix encompasses the union of the masc uline trinity with the feminine quaternity. It depicts the union of soul and spirit, of the soul with the divine. As a synthesizing symbol, it is an embodiment of spirit and soul, dist inct but attached.

[Vector Equilibrium Matrix diagrams 1-5 Regenerativ e Patternings] C. THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN PSYCHE AND MATTER: Within the current laws of physics, there is always an overview law or paradigm . More often than not, this structuring is not immediately evident within the specific law. This overview is implicate to the specific, still enfolded within it, yet a priori to it. The limited, objective viewpoint is defined as explicate. The implicate law can be considered as more encompassing than the expli cate since it enfolds the explicate plus something undefinable. A specific examp le is gravity and its explicate relationship to the force of gravity. The force of gravity is exp licate in that it is measurable within a limited context. Gravity is not even und erstood in physics. Explicate ordering may be used for practical application in a limited conte xt. This form of ordering does not, however, tell us anything about the Totality. The word \"transformation\" is thus used to describe a simple geometric change wit hin a given explicate order. What occurs in the broader context of the implicate order appears as a quantized transformation: metamorphosis. This form of transformation is characteristic of psyche. In Greek, psych e literally means butterfly. The butterfly does not evolve, but rather its quantized change occurs within a vessel of transformation--the cocoon. The new science of chaos theory postulates a so-called \"butterfly effect\" which contends that a simple movement of the butterfly's wing in Indonesia can create a hurricane t housands of miles away. Psyche also expresses this chaotic sensitivity to changes in initial con ditions. You never know quite where it will go next. Fundamental characteristics of psyche render it undefinable, from the explicate point-of-view. It is cease lessly becoming, and the mystery of consciousness lies in its hidden (or occulted) imp licate nature. The implicate order may be seen to apply both to matter (organic and inorgan ic) and consciousness. This is equivalent to the alchemical goal of uniting ps yche and matter. It requires, however, redefining our concept of consciousness . Both parapsychology and analytical psychology have defined consciousness in ter ms that are most appropriate to \"ego-consciousness.\" It is linear, directed t hinking. Ego-consciousness is linear, directed, transcendence-oriented and m onotheistic. It is"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"heroic, and as such is goal-oriented and produces the fantasy of moving consciousness through a series of hierarchal stages of development. There is another way of imagining exitence, where soul rather than spirit is the primary motivation. In fact, there are differing styles of consciousness, depending on our perspective. Styles of consciousness are relative to one another. Withi n our developing framework, we might consider ego-consciousness as explicate. However, anima-consciousness mediates implicate order. Anima-consci ousness, as conceived by James Hillman's school of imaginal psychology, is a multi-centered polytheistic perspective. Its concerns are being-in-soul, not becomi ng more, better, best or perfect. It is perceived as a coincidence of processes. All phas es are present at once, enfolded in any part. It is experienced as a series of superimpos ed images. It is reflective and concerned with inter-relationships. It is dif fused, not focused awareness. It mediates the unknown, or unconsciousness--that which is yet to unfold and still lies hidden behind the 'veil.' ' Anima ' is the Latin form of the Greek word, ' psyche .' They are cognate. James Hillman has called anima the archetype of psyche. As psyche means butter fly, he says it indicates \" a consciousness that does not soar but stays attached, that hovers and flutters over the field of natural events.\" Anima-consciousness comes through images, multi-sensory images, from the primitive gut reaction to the most exalted vision. It brings awareness th at fantasies are everywhere, conditioning our perception of reality and our place in it. Im ages and fantasies are not separate from our reality, but are fundamental to our not ions about reality. Jung says, \" image is psyche .\" Anima, as the archetype of psychic consciousness, makes us aware of our areas of unconsciousness. Soul, in its relationship with spirit, constantly i nvades the day- world of consciousness with images, fears, moods and mystery. It is elusi ve, ambiguous and paradoxical. The interaction of spirit and soul, discrete yet connected, represe nts the sacred marriage, or coniunctio. So, one task is to distinguish them, one from the othe r. They have been confounded in theology, philosophy, psychology, and science. Descarte equated the ego with the soul, a grievous mis-representati on. Anima, is a diffuse consciousness that seeks to re-create and unify with spiri t in the royal marriage. This mode of perception is conscious of its unconsciousness and can re cognize the potential latent in the unknown aspect (the promise of the divine ch ild). This style of consciousness can be characterized as illumined lunacy, and was a charact eristic of many of the saints and sages throughout history. When we can get outside of our culturally-programmed heroic consciousnes s and experience the world of imagination, dreams and creativity, the ego reali zes that there are possibilities far outside of its sphere of observation."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"There is an inevitable uncertainty principle in the realms of both matt er and psyche.

THE DIAMOND BODY VISUALIZATION We all have an Observer Self, which dispassionately looks at ourselves from an elevated perspective. It is from the eyes of this self that we \"see\" i nto the visionary world. The scientist is a diminutive form of this unbiased viewer whi ch is archetypal in nature. In mysticism, the observer observes himself, in science, the world of t hings. The observation disturbs the experiment and uncertainty is created in the measurement. Within all observable phenomena there exists that part which is not em pirically observed. This is primarily due to the choice of position in observation (loc ation in space--viewpoint). The unconscious of the observer influences the r esult of the experiement despite any conscious intent. The mystic has a priori ideas about the spiritual nature of reality. His obs erver-bias leads him to experience his spiritual world within his own cult ural metaphors. It is a sort of \" I wouldn't have seen it, if I hadn't believed it \" consciousness. The beliefs are more fundamental than, and condition, the experiential consciousness- journeys the aspirant enjoys. The marriage of psyche and spirit means a blending of rational and intuitive s tyles of consciousness, a dance of mutuality where each enhances the other. Th e word, 'psychology', is composed of the roots psyche and logos. It is an interaction betwe en the imaginative anima and psychological intellect. Anima consciousness me diates the implicate order, logos allows us to articulate on limited, or explicate , aspects of existence. In its attempts to explain, it gives voice to soul. The logos principl e gives speech to psyche. Therefore, the mandate of psychology is to harken to the spee ch of the soul. The secret and key of psychological work requires the airy imagination of the soul, that is, the capacity of imagining events \"outside\" of the natural bodily perspective of empirical and material literalism but in regard to a subtle or fantasy body of psychic reality. Being-in-soul requires being in a body too, but this body is built of soul stuff; it is a \"breath body.\" Fantasy images are this stuff, this \"subtle body.\" The key to the entire psychological opus...is body- building via imagination.(1) This body-building is a creative act of fantasy. Within it, the many do not beco me one but become psychic material. An example of this process is memory. A nima and matter unite when psychic experiences are encoded in the brain cel ls of the physical"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"body, or any cells. Psychic experiences encompass all the manifestations of t he imaginal life: there is fantasy in behavior, emotions, thoughts, convictions, etc . When you de-literalize your own fundamental beliefs about body, self, and world you learn to see through the mundane aspects of existence into the depth s of its archetypal meaning and value. Karl Pribram has suggested that memory is not stored in a particular ce ll, but is enfolded over the whole. This storage system resembles a hologram in its fun ction. It might be considered as an information-processing system, but Pribram s uggsts that it is probably best not to speak of information-processing, but of image-proce ssing. The term 'information' suggests that the sensory input has become divi ded into sections or alternatives, whereas image-processing implies a more holis tic mechanism at work. In therapy, this is why experiential therapies work on trauma. By moving thr ough the imagery of what the experience is like, catharsis becomes possible . The image may be visual or visceral--it is a multi-sensory gestalt which includes all aspects of the psychophysical being. One example is muscle memory, or embedded tis sue memory. Under imagery processing techniques these memories become available for review and transformation. This holographic system is one view which is part of the more general \" holographic concept of reality.\" In this new existential paradigm, we are not separate c hemical entities, but interconnected webworks of wave-fronts in space. This is why, from the perspective of psyche, self and environment tend to meld together and syn chronicity becomes the norm. The image is psyche and all forms of perception come thr ough imagery. Consciousness always relates through metaphors of body-perception. It \"sees\" or \"hears\" with inner analogs of the natural senses. This connec tion of mind and body is rightly called psychosomatic. Physicist David Bohm comments on the nature of mind and body: In the implicate order we have to say that mind enfolds matter in general and therefore body in particular. Similarly, the body enfolds not only the mind but also in some sense the entire material universe...So we do not say that min d and body causally affect each other, but rather that the movements of both are the outcome of related projections of a common higher-dimensional ground. As a human being takes part in the process of this totality, he is fundamentall y changed in the very activity in which his aim is to change that reality wh ich is the content of his consciousness. To fail to take this into account must inevitably lead one to serious and sustained confusion in all that one does.(2) The realm of imagination is psychic reality. 'Psychic' means physical and me ntal. A life lived within the realm of imagination experiences the relationsh ip between soul and spirit. This may be seen as a psychosomatic activity which supercedes a one - sided rationalism. ________________________________________________________________________"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"_____ (1) James Hillman, \"Anima II,\" Spring Journal 1974, Spring Pub., Dallas.

HERMETIC PHILOSOPHY AND THE DIAMOND BODY Hermetic philosophy combines diverse disciplines. Hermes is the archetype of Magick, alchemy, and psychology. As physics drops its antiquated Apollonic orientation, it too may be seen as a mercurial path delving into the unknown . Science, in general, has traditionally been ascribed to the realm of Mercur y. Whether known as Hermes, Mercury, or Thoth, this archetypal power is Lord of Magick. He is a guide of souls into the underworld, or psyche. He is also a messenger of the gods, or archetypes. Communication between gods and men i s generally through a Hermetic process. Hermes is known as the maker of synchronicity. Personalities dominated by Hermes' perspective seem to be interested in the hidden side of things, the implicate aspect. They are carriers of the secret lore, of things that aren't on the su rface. They expound and speculate about the nature of the unknown, transcending the ordinary boundaries of human understanding. In its highest form, this Hermetic motivation may be seen in the acti vities of the physicists, psychologists, and occultists. In alchemy, Hermes is known as the spirit Mercurius. Mercurius is a relevant symbol in our investigation of the Philosopher's St one. The nexus of the Diamond Body is formed by superimposition of ALEPH and TAU. In Figure , Aleph is seen as the vertical axis with Tau being the center poin t, corresponding to the heart-center. Jung quotes from the \" Aurelia Occulta \" which calls Mercurius \" Azoth \": For he is the A and O that is everywhere present. The philosophers have ad orned (him) with the name Azoth, which is composed of the A and Z of the Latins , and the alpha and omega of the Greeks, and the Aleph and Tau of the Hebrews. Israel Regardie, in THE TREE OF LIFE , (pg. 62) has equated Azoth with the Anima Mundi, which is the World Soul of Alchemy. He relates Azoth direc tly to electromagnetic (EM) fields. The phenomenon was known in the past as the Astral Light. Mercurius, as an arcane substance, has diverse elements. The identity b etween Mercurius and the Philosopher's Stone becomes evident through the ke y words which describe him.

Mercury, as lapis, is p rima materia and ultima materia: the goal of the Great Work. This magickal child is t he intitial and end product. He is 0, The Fool, whose brand of lunacy James Hillman (1980) so aptly describes: Insanity is essential to soul-making...brighter awareness through lun acy. Alchemical soul-making proposes that the final idea of Sun conjoined with Moon means nothing less and no other than a conditon of being in which solar brilliance and awareness and moon-madness are marvelously conjoined. The Mysterium Coniunctionis is illumined lunacy.(1) We can develop both our mediumistic sensitivities and our psychological aw areness. Thus, through meditation and imagination, we become adequate vessels to con tain relationships with archetypal energies or powers. Because of the funda mental nature of psyche and the archetypal patterns, we can neither do nor imagine anything that is outside of the scope of the Gods. In his four-fold nature, Mercurius quadratus , represents the lapis with the four elements. These elements correspond with the cardinal direction s. They could also be seen as the four Jungian functions: intuition, thinking, feeling, and sensation. Mercurius forms the mid-point of the cosmic quaternity and represe nts the quinta essentia, the unification of the four elements."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"This enfolds the implicate essence of the physical world, i.e. anima mun di, a modern representation of the Self, Self-as-Many. Hermetic philosophy attached the greatest importance to the Stone. Its importance surpassed all other concepts and s ymbols. Alchemists strove for total union of opposites in symbolic form. This may b e viewed metaphorically as the Vector Equilibrium Matrix. This union was charact erized as material and spiritual, living as well as inert, masculine/feminine, you ng/old, and morally neutral. This state is created through interaction of man and God. It is the re-union of the spirit and the body, which takes place in the retort, or vessel. The transf ormation culminates in the Chymical Marriage. Insights gained should be made real. T he value of the Stone remains latent if it is not properly applied. Both the soul and Mercurius were considered to be round in alchemy. Re member, the Diamond Body matrix represents 12 around 1 closest-packed-spheres. Jun g states that \" In alchemy Mercurius is the rotundum, par excellence. \" Mercurius represents totality and wholeness. Gerhard Dorn, seventeenth centur y alchemist, called Mercurius \" the true hermaphroditic Adam and microcosm. \" Mercurius is thus seen as androgynous. Mercurius, as the anima mundi, is inherent in all things in a latent stat e. The anima mundi is the feminine component of Mercurius. The conjunction is not always a direct union. The soul mediates between body and spirit, through the m edium of Mercurius. Jung elaborates on his nature in Mysterium Coniunctionis : In my special study of the subject I have pointed out that outwardly Mercur ius corresponds to quicksilver but inwardly he is a \"deus terrenus\" and an anima mundi--in other words, that part of God which, when he \"imagined\" the world, was as it were left behind in his Creation or, like the Sophia of the Gnostics, got lost in Physis. Mercurius has the character which Dorn ascribes to the s oul. He is \"good with the good, evil with the evil,\" and thus occupies a middle position morally...In a psychological sense Mercurius represents the unconscious , for this is to all apearances that \"spirit\" which comes closest to organic mat ter and has all the paradoxical qualities attributed to Mercurius.(2) We can summarize the various qualities of Mercurius as the Philospher 's Stone. These key descriptors must be satisfied by our contemporary model of t he Stone. The lapis is a double thing formed of the union or coniunctio of opposites. I t is: 1. called the androgyne and immortal child. 2. the unchangeable quality of the union of spirit and matter. 3. a rotundum, or round thing. 4. central circle, which is stone, gem, and yet not (naught). 5. composed of body and soul united to form a spirit."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"6. Mercurius, a living being; the product of an act of fertilization. 7. fathered by the sun; mother is the moon. 8. a babe, stone, or pearl. 9. the mystical marriage: alchemist and his wife/soror mystica; wise man and prophetess; great mother and magician. Coniunctio. 10. able to multiply itself indefinitely (i.e. its geometry is expandable or contractable). The Royal Marriage, or coniunctio is not accomplished by will. The Diamond Body includes marriages or union of opposites in all directions, between t op (ego) and bottom (Self), between the four directional points, yielding six connec ted vertices. This figure is an octahedron. The center is the point of immediate concern. It represents the f ine point of the soul. It is both conscious and unconscious. It is bi-sexual. The transforming im age combines opposites in one eloquent symbol. The Diamond Body resolves the multiplicity of archetypes into ordered groupings in imaginal space. This m atrix, which extends in all directions including time, represents a diff use awareness. Psychologically, it creates and perpetuates a state of ultimate equilibrat ion. It is a natural preparation for death, freeing one of emotional entanglement. A pers on who gains the ability to live with his instincts can also detach from them in a natural way. This form of integration is not heroic. There is no self-conquest toward perfection, but self-acceptance and relationship. The Diamond Body visualization technique co-ordinates the manifold cont ents of the psyche. Realization of ALEPH-TAU unites us with the unconscious levels of our being. It is an ultimate aesthetic act. It sets up the conditions neces sary for \"immortality\" of the soul by giving it access to sacred time and space. The figure graphically depicted as the octahedron-within-a-cube (Th e Diamond Body) is a minimum structural matrix of the universe. The vector equili brium matrix is a reciprocal depiction. Through it man is able to metaphorically experience macrocosm and microcosm. The Diamond Body is a generator of magickal energy. It is an imaginal time/space machine. When the magician imagines himself within the matrix and cen ters in ALEPH-TAU , he is co-equivalent with Hermes/Mercurius --he is Lord of Magick. ________________________________________________________________________ ______ (1) James Hillman, \" Silver and the White Earth\", Spring 1980, Spring Pub., Dallas.

SEPHIR YETZIRAH: THE BOOK OF FORMATION: There is an explicit link between the Diamond Body configuration (showi ng the atomic structure of diamond crystals) and a traditional meditation techni que from Jewish mysticism. A description of the figure appears in the classical text, SEPHIR YETZIRAH, THE BOOK OF FORMATION. THE SEPHIR YETZIRAH is a fundamental text of written Qabalah. Legend says the book was recorded by the Patriarch Abraham. Its lineage is supported by r ecent archeological discoveries. Chapter 5 of the Book of Formation details correspondences of the constellations with month of the calendar system in use at the time. This data has been analyzed as predating astronomical knowledge of the Precession of the Equinoxes. The correspondences synchronize during t he time of Abraham, approximately 4,000 years ago. Further support of this date is provided by the fact that the original te xt is inscribed in the Sinatic alphabet. This is comprised of the original Hebrew lette rs revealed to Abraham. It predates the square Aramaic letters used by Ezra the Scrib e by more than a thousand years. Jewish scholar, Gershom Scholem makes a more conservative estimate on the antiquity of the book. He dates its composit ion between the third and sixth centuries. In any event, it is a magical treatise and a tool whose aim was speculative rather than ecstatic. THE BOOK OF FORMATION describes the emanation of the ten spheres of the Tree of Life. The spheres are connected to one another by twenty-two paths , which correspond with the Hebrew letters (Path 0=Aleph, Path I=Beth, Path II=Gimel, Path III=Daleth, etc.). Together, the spheres and connecting paths form a map of the universe. The sacred letters are symbolic glyphs which represe nt sounds. Both spheres and paths represent discret domains which order dive rse contents. The contents of any domain are determined by the archetypal dominant residing at the core of the content in question. In general, spheres represent modes- of-being, and paths represent transition stages, or gates between them. Qabalah presents the individual soul as a Microcosm which is a reflecti on of the Celestial Man, or Macrocosm. Hermetic philosopher Aleister Crowley sugge sted that, \" The soul interprets the universe; the universe veils the soul. \" The universal man is also called Animus Mundi. The doctrine presented here is one o f the primary examples of the Hermetic dictum, \" As above, so below. \" Through the identity of the individual with the universal, we have the option of participating consci ously in the divine process of creation. The individual, as a physio-spiritual entity is represented by the geo metric configuration of the Tree of Life, pervading the human form. The spheres, or Sephiroth, are imaginal representations of a set of self-consistent wor lds or planes of consciousness. There is orderly transition between them."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The twenty-two paths provide a means of accessing the connected series of experiences based on changing states-of-consciousness. The perception of this process occurs through imagery. It is coordinated through the system of correspondences. It provides the most eloquent, elaborate, an d comprehensive system for metaphorical perception of imaginal realms. T ranslating the message into a special language adapted to the channel's information rat e is called coding. Qabalah (QBL) is a coded form of information concerning self-realization and mystical experience which is suited specifically to the human rece ptor. In Hebrew numerology, QBL = 132 = \" to receive .\" There are various spellings for Qabala or Kabbalah, but this consonants-only form yields the proper numerical equi valent. Tree of Life modeling permits discreet focal points for easy, methodical concentration for long periods of time. The depth of differentiation of arc hetypes elaborated by this system categorizes, or modularizes, the characteri stic experiences of various stages of mystical progress. See Table for a taxonomy of mystical states in relation to the spheres of the Tree of Life. Different spheres are the domain of different divine attributes (f or example, Chesed is the sphere of Mercy, Geburah is the sphere of Severity, etc.). The p aths provide gateways to the discreet states of consciousness graphically depicted as t he spheres. With such an ancient tradition, QBL provides grounding for one's philosoph y in a comprehensive range of highly developed and extensively tested discipl ines. The letters of the sacred Hebrew alphabet are employed as tools in a wide varie ty of meditational and invocative techniques. Each letter has a tone associate with it, so the words and phrases may be sung. Each letter or path corresponds explicitly with a number (i.e. Tiphar eth = 6, Yesod = 9, Aleph = 1, Mem = 40, Shin = 300). Number and letter are alternative ways of depicting the same entity, or archetypal process. Mathematical manipulat ion of the Hebrew alphabet is a primary way of working within the system. (Comple te numerical equivalents for the alphabet are included in Appendix B). The mathematical science of Gematria allows a means of viewing the relationsh ip between diverse groupings represented by the spheres and paths. Each letter has a numerical value which is qualitative not quantitative. Its function is t o disclose intensities, valuation and rhythm. Codified numerical equivalence between words may be discovered. For e xample, in Hebrew, both the word 'love' and the word 'unity' add to 13. Therefore, they are cognate. They express the same nature or quality. Each letter or number signif ies that aspect of divinity which is inherent in it. The number of a word or ph rase shows its quality and its relationship to other things and ideas. Through the numerical value attached to words and phrases, one is able to see metaphorical equivalents among apparently unrelated concepts.

It helps one see w hat is not readily apparent. It accomodates as much depth and volume as a person's inner complexity brings to it. Modern magickal practice has adopted the system presented in QBL as it s basis. It uses the Tree of Life as a consciousness map. This is because it is compr ehensive, eloquent, and extremely efficient. The occult deals primarily with re alization of latent subconscious cognitive abilities. It is development in areas whi ch were previously unknown (occulted or hidden) because they were unexplored . QBL has two branches: speculative/philosophical and practical/magical . In terms of information processing QBL denotes channels and levels of observation. Pat hs are transmission channels. Spheres are levels of observation. The transmiss ion channels are used to call benefic powers using the holy names of God and his angel mediators. QBL is an ancient information-processing system. The only proper application of Magick is to influence the process of one's own psychological transformation. Magick, used solely for self-transformation, fur thers religious needs. The path up the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life sho ws successive purification of a soul on its journey to union with the ultimate, or Godhe ad. It is a middle path which shows a soul undaunted in its primary desire to r eturn \"home.\" There are other paths, to be sure, but none so direct, and therefore effic ient. THE BOOK OF FORMATION had the most dynamic effect on initiating speculative QBL. As old as the SEPHIR YETZIRAH may be, it seems that mystical experience of the geometrical figure we are calling the Diamond Body predat es the composition of the book. The book is probably the exposition of a mystical system of standing tradition, which was only transmitted orally prior to the appearanc e of the text. The mystics achieved a vision of a geometrical figure through meditation p ractice. This geometry was a 4-dimensional array of the holy letters. It is a geometrical picture of the creation or formation of the universe--an omniradiant eve nt that continues to happen. Those who engaged in this meditation form were known as Merkabah visionaries . They sought ecstatic direct visionary experience of the Throne Chariot of God . Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Ezekiel, Isaac, and St. John the Divine have been associated with Merkabah mysticism. Surely, as a rabbi, Jesus was familiar w ith this practice, also. 2. MERKABAH MYSTICISM, OLD AND NEW: There is some extant literature concerning Merkabah Mysticism in add itoin to the SEPHIR YETZIRAH. The most important of these works are the Greater Hekhaloth and the Lesser Hekhaloth. Rabbinical commentary concerning th e secrets of the Throne Chariot also exists. The majority of these works were not"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"designed for practical use by mystics. They described characteristic s tages on the path to the vision of the Throne Chariot. They contain speculation rather than explicit instructions. It is possible, however, to deduce certain requirements and proceedu res from these writings: 1. The aspirant must be at least 30 years old before his study of mysticism shoul d be initiated. This ensures grounding in the day-to-day life and reduces th e chances that the immature seeker desires transcendent escape from reality. 2. Specific moral qualities were required of candidates before the myst ics were willing to reveal their secret knowledge, or Gnosis. We might assume that t hese qualitis would include those of importance in the Torah, or Law. 3. Twelve to forty days of ascetic practices, including fasting and prayer, pr eceded the soul's penetration to the revelation of the Throne. 4. Techniques for facilitating the journey included hymns and songs, the r ecitation of secret or holy names of God, and magical seals to protect the aspirant. Thes e seals warded off danger from demons and hostile angels and allowed further acc ess, much as a key unlocks a door. 5. The posture recommended during meditation is to sit in a low chair, be nd forward until the head rests on the knees. This posture enhanced the ability to experience altered states of consciousness through changes in blood flo w and subtle vibrations induced in the skeletal system by reciting god names. Breathin g becomes shallow in this position. 6. The further one progresses upon the path, the greater the dangers of psychological disintegration. The worthiness of the soul is tested on every l evel-- physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. The Qabalistic practic e of creating and dissolving images as containers for psychic forces acts as a protection again st identification with, or deification of symbols. Such potent symbols of whol eness, such as the Tree of Life, are a danger in themselves as they promote the identification of the ego with the Self. If the aspirant were unworthy, he could penetrate no further. The angels guarding the gates would confuse his mind and disturb his senses, (which shoul dn't be too difficult after 40 days of fasting). This interference could include h allucinations (rather than visionary experience), and psychosomatic manifestations of d iscomfort. In the Eastern systems of meditation, these phenomena are regarded as bl ocks to the flow of Kundalini up the spine. 7. Once the ecstatic state has been attained by the mystic, he ascends thr ough what were variously described as seven heavens or chambers. The soul ascends towar d its original home. Counting from the bottom of the Tree of Life upwards, this wo uld include the spheres of Malkuth through Chesed."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"8. At this point the soul receives its revelation. It is the vision of God as King on His Throne. This vision of God as King is the magical image of the sphere Ches ed, #4 on the Tree of Life. It is below the Abyss, where visionary I-Thou imagination is still possible. The gulf between the soul and God is not bridged below the Abyss . This meditation did not aspire to even an understanding of the true nature of God, let alone a reunion of the soul with Godhead. It was ecstatic, not transcendent. This mystic path provided perception of the phenomena of the Throne-Char iot, the awful mystery that surrounds God's majesty. A voice is heard to speak from the \"Throne of Fire.\" It conveys the secret of heaven and earth to the aspirant. It gi ves him the names of Knowledge, or Gnosis. Use of this Knowledge could be viewed as the aspirant's creation of the sph ere Daath. Daath is unique among the Sephiroth on the ascent up the Tree. In orde r for the initiate to experience Daath, he is required to first create it. Thi s is unlike the other spheres, which are a priori givens. Experience of the reciprocal vie w of the Diamond Body figure brings one back onto the Middle Pillar on the threshold of the Abyss. Meditation is a procedure. Daath, as a knowledge-contact, is a quantum change induced through Grace. It is God's answer to the call of the aspirant, and can not be induced through effort alone. In creating a Daath state of consciousness, the aspirant has crossed 'an abyss' from a procedure to a grace. In a classification of creative, psychedelic (mind-expanding), and unitive states, this development is best described as 'psychedelic.' The characteristi c experience is a transient altered state of consciousness. This ecstasy includes the experience of loss of self, time, or space. There is an infusion of a special knowledge, and a pu rification of self. The original Merkabah mystics did not aspire for this vision with intens e love of God. They did not concern themselves with speculation concerning the i mmanence of God in matter, through the Shekinah. Their interest lay in the direct experiential process of contemplating their mandala-symbol until it took on a life of it s own--a divine life. This entity projectes a revelatory character. But the immanence of God-in-matter is a philosophical issue open to spec ulation. The geometry of the Throne-Chariot or Diamond Body relates directly to the formation of matter. We might speculate that these geometrical repres entations of archetypal relationships have a great deal to do with fundamental patterns underlying all matter, even if they are only Ruachian models. The figure of the Throne-Chariot (and its reciprocal, the Vector Equi librium Matrix) and the basic blueprint for the formation of matter are not distinc t and separate. This threshold of matter, or DAATH, the Invisible Sphere does d isclose the minimum conceptual elements necessary to depict the spirit ual order inherent in matter."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"There is no way to intellectually grasp Reality beyond the Abyss. Penetration i nto these realms requires intense devotion or love. For any information regardi ng these planes we must rely on the testimony of saints who have journeys in conscious ness to these realms. Knowledge (Gnosis or Daath) takes the soul to the uppermost reaches of the causal plane. This is the limit to the realm of the mind. There is neither m ind nor matter across the Abyss. Here is the limit of the mind's ability to comprehend divine order conceptually. It is the emptying out of symbolic meaning in preparation for di rect experience of the Reality of God, through Union. Several graphic depictions of the descriptions of the Throne-Chariot gi ven in the SEPHIR YETZIRAH have been developed through the years by Jews and occultists. A group known as the Chariot of Fire from Los Angeles has used the inform ation to depict a system in which all the paths are compacted onto an octahedron. In thi s arrangement, the seven double letters are paths connecting the six sph eres which correspond to the cardinal directions, above and below, and the central Inne r Court. This Inner Court is comprised of the three Mother letters-- Aleph, Mem, and Shin --plus the nexus point which is composed of Aleph/Tau. In his book, THE TAROT (1947), Paul Foster Case developed an array which shows closer harmony with the closest-packed spheres of the diamond structu re. Here the paths are dispersed over the octahedron and its containing cube (Figure 4). It is important to include both the octahedron and the cube in the mode ling. When both are visualized, the figure has the ability to reproduce itself indef initely. It generates and regenerates itself mathematically, like a fractal. It proj ects outward or inward in an infinite geometrical progression. There is an infinite series of octahedrons within cubes within octah edrons within cubes. This is another way of viewing the matrix structure which has bee n described elsewhere as the Vector Equilibrium Matrix. Case showed the paths, or keys, in relationship to the Bravis lattice. He di d not add the connecting lines which reveal the octahedron within the Cube o f Space. This may have been intentional, as he felt careful study of the figure would reve al much to the discerning reader. Perhaps more than he might have imagined... In any event, this array shows the three \"Mother letters\" as Cartesian coordi nates. These represent the three dimensions, the fourth being the synchr onous Aleph/Tau in the center. This center is the holy place in the midst of manifest ation which shows forth the sacred aspect of time. The planetary gates are shown as the central points of the six plane faces of th e cube. The rest of the paths are shown on the matrix of the cube edges. Case, true to prevailing attitudes in occultists of his day, attempted to obscure the proper correspondences for the Cube. Most of the attributions agree with the text of"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"the SEPHIR YETZIRAH. However, two letters are switched. Lamed (Key 11, L) is ascribed to the compass direction Northwest; Southwest is listed as Nun (Key 13, N). The proper order, according to THE BOOK OF FORMATION, is Northwest = N, Nun ; Southwest = L, Lamed. Past generations of occultists would frequently present most of t heir information accurately. However, they would change at least one element. They reasoned th at the serious student would discover the discrepancies through astute observation. This practice was intended to preserve the highly effective magical t echniques from easy access by the vulgar, who might misapply them. This attitude hardly seem s appropriate today. There are competent people who might appreciate magick as a highly devloped art-form if the system were presented in a consistent , credible manner. The vulgar, or dilettante, can never apply even the most profound teaching. It requires the discipline of follow-through. Psyche's secrets are s afe because they are not communicable to those who haven't experienced them. They are initiati ons. 3. INFORMATION CODING AND ACCESS-STATES The Hebrew alphabet, of all languages, has certain qualities which make i t extremely efficient for the transmission of information with minimal distortion. Its sacred aspect may be shown best by examination of the inherent mathema tical superiority of the language. Redundancy percents allow us to evaluate relative efficiencies of variou s languages or codes. The frequency of appearance of the various letters of an alphabet determines the relative redundancy. The constraints imposed by the language itself furnish the gross redun dancy level. For example: the redundancy of French letters is 19%, relative redun dancy of Hebrew letters is 10.4%. Gross redundancy of the French language is around 45%, that of English is 50%. Here, classical Hebrew shows its remarkable eff iciency. This is largely because it is constituted of a majority of consonants. A remarkable consequence of redundancy nicely illustrates the over-all character of our intuitive knowledge of language. It is the possibility of making crosswords, that is, of attaching each letter to systems of different n-gram probabilities. If the redundancy were zero, any collection of letters would be a possible and meaningful message, as is the case with certain secret telegr aph codes used in commerce. If the redundancy is too high, the structure of the languages imposes too rigorous internal constraints. In order for two- dimensional crosswords to be possible, redundancy must be at most 50 per cent; three-dimensional crosswords are possible if the redundancy does not exceed 33 per cent. Thus from the above example, it should be possible to make three- dimensional crosswords in classical Hebrew. Such crosswords have been realized by H. Bluhme in Munich.(1)"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"There are limits in any given access-state which depend upon the met hod of decoding information transmitted. All symbolic representations are en coded information. All other things being equal, the most original message is comp osed in a system such that all the symbols are equiprobable. In classical Hebrew, e xclusive use of consonants (except vav and yod ) creates a more nearly equal distribution of written symbols and a majority of words composed of three root letters. In any limited system, prior events effect the probability of occurance of any given symbol. The probability of a symbol depends upon preceding symbols in the sequence. Within a given alphabet there are constraints upon maximum information flow. These are related to relative information and redundancy l evels. There are limits imposed on the flow of perceptible information whe ther it is received via imagery or language. The constraints of language are greater. The repertoire of possibilities is smaller. The amount of constraint impos ed by grammar is enormous. A holographic display, like the Throne-Chariot or Cube of Space displays more simultaneous possibilities. Assuming the possibility and desirability of communicating with enti ties in other dimensions, a message of maximum information may appear senseless if the individual does not have a coherent system to decode it. Redundancy, or chron ic reappearance, provides a guarantee against errors in transmission. This fact of information-processing may bear on the chronic reappearance of archetypes i n an infinite variety of forms. Speculative QBL cuts through the complexity of the experience of archet ypal reality. It postulates one form of order within the chaos of ever-shifting im agery, a way of uniting the living opposites. It provides an intelligible conception which schematizes reality. It offers the Tree of Life as its comprehens ive consciousness map of the human psyche, realm of spirit, and the Creation. The philosophical concept of the Philosopher's Stone or Diamond Body im plies the access-state represented in QBL as Tiphareth, the heart-center. I n mystical experience, an enormous amount of emotional and cognitive information is recei ved in a short period of time. While this enlightenment, in theory, is a complete experience, it requ ires time to digest and decode. It would be an error to assume than an individual--a psych o- physiological mechanism--could instantly absorb an unlimited quantity of information. No individual may become omniscient. There is an upper limit to the apprehension of information in any given inst ant. A maximum flow of perceptible information per unit of time exists. This l imit has been measured at 10 to 20 bits per second (Quastler, 1955). Perception actually takes place through a process of filtering, or perceptual selection. Too large a flow of information is perceived as absence of structure or int ernal information. IT APPEARS AS CHAOS. This becomes evident in therapy wh en clients journey deep into their dreams. In following the images down de eper, they"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"ultimately find swirling, funnelling images or great voids. Just past thi s point in the journey is the healing place. This chaos is perhaps the major disorientation experienced by those un prepared for the crossing of the Abyss. Therefore, if our intent is to extend our percep tual field, it is advantageous to channel information by providing a system and boundaries. This focuses our perceptions on a digestible amount of data. In other words, intui tive perceptions from within can be grounded in daily life. Tree of Life modeling allows for quantized conceptualization of mystical experiences. Toward this end, the coded system uses the qualitative dis tinctions of spheres, paths, letters, numbers and other components of the corresp ondence system. 4. THE HEBREW ALPHABET [Hebrew Alphabet] Since all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are glyphs for the sounds they represent, mystical use of this alphabet may be seen as the synchronous union of the s oul with the sound-current. This is a time-honored tradition which has to do wit h the nature of the Word, or Logos, as an inner mystical \"sound\" which carries the aspirant's soul up into the higher planes like a magnet. (see VOICE OF THE SILENCE, by Mdm. Blavatsky). We may infer, from research in information theory, that maximum originality or information is transported by messages in which all symbols have an equal probability. An equal distribution of probabilities furnishes in ef fect the maximum of choice. Maximal transference of information is only possible for a receptor who is totally ignorant of what might be transmitted (beginner's mind). Images are more fundamental than symbols. They present themselves pri or to the focusing on various symbols. Imaginal psychology is trying to re-capture this primacy of image over symbol. An image preserves the specific context, mood, and unique qualities by holding symbols in the subtle net, or matrix, of imagin al life, which is its underlying reality. We have become accustomed to asking the rote meaning of things when it comes to symbols and dreams. This reductionis tic approach loses contact with the unknown aspect of the autonomous stream of imagery. In anima-consciousness (being-in-soul), imagery takes priority over symbol . The repertoire of images is infinite. The gamut of archetypal potentials inte ract with one another in eternally unique, creative acts. These creative acts, perceive d via imagery (through metaphorical sensory perception), do not symbolize something el se. In a polytheistic orientation, all gods are co-equal and co-temporaneous. They may or may-not all be coordinated by some over-arching principle. They have equal potential for manifestation in any given moment. They operate in the matrix of the four planes of Reality. This is the soul-field. It encompasses physi cal, emotional,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"intellectual, and spiritual (archetypal) levels. It is a direct personal experience of the unknown. Individuals do not have either the emotional or intellectual capacity to c omprehend \"God\" as an all-inclusive principle. We may, however, differentiate discre et aspects of the psyche in digestible quanta. God has various divine attributes, or characteristics. In polytheistic systems, these are presented as various gods and goddess es. Each is sovereign in its realm, and has the capacity to influence the human body throu gh symptoms, behavior, emotions, thoughts or ideas, convictions, and spiritual experience. Existing independent of space and time, they are equiprobab le. Thus an image is not pre-determined or predictable. It is direct per ceptual experience of the unknown, and in fact, unknowable. The appearance of a symb ol, however, allows us to infer manifestation of corresponding processes whic h occur either in space or time. The symbol is both a primitive expression of the unconscious and an idea corresponding to the highest intuitions of ego-consciousness. But symbols do not appear in isolation. Symbols are held enfolded in the net of an image which probably includes visceral sensations. A visual image may entrai n other senses like taste or smell. The appearance of symbols in anyone's psyc he is predictable. What symbols will appear and how they will be presented in m ulti- sensory imagery is not predictable, much less what they mean. The predictability of symbols (their tendency to recur cross-cul turally in mankind's psyche) and the unique quality of symbols contained in imagery show a relat ionship between explicate and implicate order. They are fundamental components in the language of the psyche. Symbols are best described or catalogued by archetypal processes and their ruling god or goddess, with their attendant attribut es and correspondences. Since all parts of the process are inferred, or enfolded by a symbol, they allow u s to predict future occurrences within the framework of probability. Give n an elaborate, but limited repertoire of symbols, there is an upper limit to informat ion output. Uniform distribution, or equiprobability, offers the maximum possibl e choice in constructing a message. Shannon, following remarks of Boltzman and Szilar d, has given the name maximum entropy to this maximum information. In other words- - chaos. In a mystical experience, there is a communication between a human rec eptor and a god-form. The Jewish system is so finely tuned that total enlightenment c an be achieved through meditation on a single letter, according to their elders . The archetype makes its presence known through corresponding imagery. To si mulate its eternal aspect, it re-iterates itself over-and-over in a symbiotic relationship with humanity."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"In other words, while we cannot assimilate the maximum information whic h is the archetype itself, we can decode an optimal amount of relative information t hrough the correspondence system. This is accomplished by \"seeing through\" the literal aspects of life into the dimension of psyche and the gods. It is accomplis hed simply by noticing. Repetition, or redundancy, increases the possibility that the message will be noticed. How many times have we realized there was a lesson to be learned in an experi ence that we should have gotten earlier in life? By noticing the archetype's infl uence, you take up a conscious relationship with it. To give it attention is to give it w orship, but not necessarily in a formal, religious way. In information theory, a message has a degree of predictability which is in ratio to its degree of coherence, or regularity. Foresight is enhanced by knowle dge of which symbols are component parts of each archetypal pattern. It is a clue you are de aling with Apollo, for example, when you have fantasies of the omnipotence of scienc e, or fascinations with \"solar\" occupations like music or healing. The symbols may be bolder or more primal, like a mandala, totem animal, or just a color. If one of the symbols presents itself, there is a high degree of probabi lity others with the same theme will follow, reiterating the message. The presence of the entire process is inferred from viewing a part of it, like a hologram. This par t, which comes into observation through the soul, is the unfolding of a portion of t he implicate order. ________________________________________________________________________ _____ (1) Abraham Moles, INFORMATION THEORY AND ESTHETIC PERCEPTION, Urbana, Chicago and London, University of Illinois Press, 1968. ________________________________________________________________________ _____ 5. THE SELF, ALEPH/TAU , THE NEXUS OF THE DIAMOND BODY Aleph, the beginning, and Tau, the end are simultaneously attributed to th e center of the Diamond Body or Throne-Chariot. This center with its coordinated oppos ites radiantly arrayed around about itself, is an archetype of the Self. There is a rhythm or periodicity in the unfolding of psychic processes. A knowledge of the wavelength or cycle of this process makes accurate prediction of its b ehavior more likely. Phenomena perceptible to the human senses always display a f orm of periodicity. Only periodic or regular repetition provokes expectation. Expectation is an es sential condition to foreknowledge. Looking forward is expectation, not certainty. Archetypal processes are re-current or chronic. This chronicity, or te ndency to continually re-appear over time describes the fundamental manifestat ion of archetypes in the space/time continuum."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The archetypal process is a special case event, or series of events. It occ urs in time. For example: there are several ways for the soul to experience ascent u p the Tree of Life. This is enactment of the archetype of \"The Way.\" As in the case of psychological individuation, it is unique for each individual--an experi ential journey through many states of consciousness. Pathworking can take place within the context of various religions--Christ ian, Hindu, Buddhist, neo-pagan, etc. It could be approached as a spiritual scien ce. A wide assortment of entities might be encountered, etc. These variati ons of detail constitute the unfolding of an archetypal process. Body and mind are affecte d by the archetype's attempt to manifest itself in space and time. ...archetypal psychology does not see psyche and soma working as Cartesian opposites in the first place. What is so surprising about synchronicity once one assumes that soma is subsumed by psyche? There is no need to work out a factor called synchronicity--only, we might suggest, the basic factor of \"chronicity\", which is the time of the soul itself. Instead of sayin g spookily, that some events are \"synchronistic\", we should see all events as \"chronic.\" It is, after all, only with Cartesian dualism that one needs a concept of synchronic ity- -if body is taken as fantasy, it too is soul and a dualism is uncalled for. There is nothing to be \"joined.\" (1) The recurrence or redundancy of phenomena becomes apparent after a p eriod of observation. Archetypal phenomena become expected when you learn to see them everywhere, operating all the time. There is a repertoire of archetypal processes, which unfold themselve s time and again. These phenomena can be viewed from a perspective termed synchronici ty. We are not witnessing \"meaningful but acausal connectedness,\" but recu rrent patterns with corresponding details. It is probable, therefore expec ted, that the whole entourage of correspondences will follow in the wake of an archetypal activation. For example, if a man is relating to his anima, virtually everything in hi s moods, environment, dreams, and thoughts will feed this back to him, in a sub tle disguise. A person who takes a sudden interest in \"expanding his consciousness\" might be seen as being under the influence of Apollo. The correspondences or ke ywords attached to this type of temperament allow us to make certain generalizati ons concerning future psychic processes. We would expect an increase in values attributed to such qualities as light , clarity, and truth. The principle of rational consciousness might be held in one -sided esteem. Involvements with music or medicine could occur. The creativ e imagination would stir with inspiration as the result. The intensity of these exp eriences might be frightening. Dream figures might include fair-haired youths, fantasies of illumination, etc."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Any or all of these characteristic experiences might precipitate int o the life-story of the individual. But this is more than a meaningful coincidence. It is an expected unfoldment of an archetypal process by an aware observer. The details of the enactment remain unique and unknown, but the characteristics of t he major recurrent patterns are the same. The soul enfolds extremes. In the matrix of the soul-field one can emb race conflicting viewpoints, and hold those modes of consciousness simultane ously. This is a form of the union of opposites. To continue the above example: the indi vidual might become aware of his inherent Dionysian aspect (which is the coun terpart of Apollo). Instead of experiencing conflict, he might develop appreciation of b oth modes of being. Magickal use of symbols in ceremony ignites unfoldment of the \"process\" wh ich is encoded in the symbol. The process functions through visualization. Libi do, or psychic energy or magical Will, is consciously poured into the unconscious i n order to activate it. The experience of the Diamond Body meditation produces congruence of the letters ALEPH/TAU, the beginning and the end. Aleph/Tau might be seen as the p sychic reality which combined appear as \"synchronicity/chronicity.\" This inti mates something about the cyclic or recurrent nature of time. Aleph, as Air, permeates the whole Cube. Aleph, the airy \"breath spirit\" Mercurius, is the vertical axis of the Diamond Body. The path indicates a \"trickster\" as pect through its correspondence with the planet Uranus, unexpected meani ngful connectedness. Synchronicity helps explain the subjective experience, so important in li fe of \"meaningful coincidence.\" It also provides a hypothesis for understanding divination in astrology, tarot, and the like. It does not explain the effect of magic in invoking forces, changing patterns through ritual, effecting healing or fulfilling desires. (2) These effects of Magick are produced through the magician's relationship to his \"will.\" His ability to change things is in direct proportion to the amount of psychic energy he can free-up and focus on his desire for transformation. This \"energized enthusiasm\" is a creative act which can also be accompli shed by generating libido through a meditation technique. Most commonly, a psychotroni c machine, or meditation \"device\" is employed. Examples of such devices ar e the Middle Pillar Exercise, Sex Magick operations, and the Diamond Body Exercis e. This \"will\" consists of ego-consciousness making a free choice to work wi th the subconscious toward an end, the True Will. The True Will is the expressi on of highest inner aspiration. Consistent activity in this direction is the Great Work, the opus of soul-making."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The main method used is to place one's magickal practice in synch with ps yche's rhythmical transformation processes. These include seasonal changes, l unar tides, biorhythms, and brainwaves. Most of these systems are related to electromagne tic (EM) fields. EM fields are seen to control, manipulate, and direct internal state fun ctions and chemistry. By focused attention, it is possible to generate \"standing wave \" patterns in both the brain and the body. Those which resonate with higher systems can produce dramatic change. Such a higher system is the electrostatic fi eld formed in the ionosphere's cavity around the earth. It is possible to create a resonance between this field and that of an individual body/mind. Ego-consciousness and anima-consciousness together represent psych ic reality. The Diamond Body, as a paradigm, contains both in Aleph/Tau. Aleph, the Middle Pi llar of the Diamond Body, is formed of the joining of I, THE MAGICIAN and II, THE HIGH PRIESTESS (Mercury and the Moon). Add Shin (Spirit) and Mem ( Water) and the gate Tau (Time) opens. Tau is corresponded with both Earth and Saturn. Saturn reminds us of th e Greek god, Chronos, whose connection with \"chronicity\" seems evident. Saturn, in astrology, is also associated with the ego and will. It is also associated with the limiting factor of time, the boundary conditions. Chronicity is sacred time (Chronos) appearing as multiple recurrence. Tau, as Saturn (Time) is th e gateway to imaginal space (KEY XXI, THE UNIVERSE). The \"nexus point\", ALEPH/TAU, is the Magickal Child of the union betw een THE MAGICIAN and THE HIGH PRIESTESS. It partakes of the nature of both. It i s androgynous. The will brings the consciousness into synch with recurr ent patterns which pulse through the psychic field. ALEPH/TAU is \"where it's A-T.\" We can experience simultaneity of a mystical level of consciousness and the c ritical, interpretative level of consciousness. This is best achieved through parallel experience on the cognitive (knowledge) level and affective (experient ial) level. ALEPH/TAU summarizes the entire Diamond Body figure. All the lette rs, in fact the entire Creation are enfolded in this central shrine. If cosmos is seen as the result of the creation of language, meditation on t he Hebrew letters within the Diamond Body matrix is a sacred paradigm, par excellence . A creation implies a superabundance of reality, in other words an irruption of the sacred into the real. It follows that every construction or fabrication has the cosmogony as paradigmatic model. The creation of the world becomes the archetype of every human gesture, whatever its plane of reference may be. (3) The Diamond Body figure is a multidimensional mandala. It is more than a ment al construct, since it is the geometrical heart of atomic structure. A mandala, in function, is essentially the same as magic circle. Mandalas have been use d extensively for magically acquiring information about the rationally unknowabl e."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"They have been used not only as concentration techniques, but also as tools for parapsychological experiments. A modern example of this occurred during studies at Maimonides Dream L abs. Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman were trying to impress certain infor mation on an individual's dream. They found that an individual, being monitored for dream states, could incorporate a mandala, (which was concentrated on by anothe r subject), into his dream. This led to their famous theory on dream telep athy. Jung has equated the mandala (inner psychic aspect) with synchronistic p henomena (parapsychological equivalent). In alchemy, this is known as the experienc e of the Unus Mundus , or One World. It is the unification of body, soul, and spirit. In the past, such magicians as Zosimos and Bruno attempted to combine thes e two equivalents into a unitary reality. One need only construct a mandala, which v ia synchronicity yields parapsychological \"knowledge\" or access. The crucial ingredient is an act of personal intervention by the magician in a given moment of time. When the individual confronts the continuum, the impl icate order emerges from its latent state--it emanates forth. One experiences knowledge of immortality and gains access to sacred time/space, which is essentiall y an escape from time. The time-scale of the archetypes is eternal, because only form is involved in time. All forms are born, die, and are time-bound. ALEPH/TAU is the nexus-point of the operation. It is the point of maximum in- between-ness. TAU corresponds, in the Diamond Body figure, with the heart-center or Tiphareth. This is the central sphere on the Tree of Life, and the ce ntral sphere of the group of closest-packed-spheres in our model. The heart-center, Tiphareth, is the Philosopher's Stone. It is the enlivening of that part of the soul known as the Ruach, the Moral Soul . The heart (Tau) of the Heart (Tiphareth) is beyond time. The Ruach, itself i s alleged to stay with the body at death, and is transcended in the Neshamah grade of the s oul. In the qabalistic tradition, it is possible to meet the Neshamah (or soul ) face to face before death. The union of mystic and soul restores the divine order. This soul and the World Soul are synonymous. \"Finding\" or \"attaining\" the Stone is one thing. However, the \"application\" of the Stone is its use as a magickal tool. Combining solar-consciousness gained at Tiphareth, with the twiligh t or anima- consciousness of THE HIGH PRIESTESS (Path II, GIMEL) gives one acces s to the Invisible Sephira DAATH. This sphere is not an a priori given on the Tr ee of Life. It is not an archetype like the other spheres. It is characterized as the gat e to an altogether different dimension. In order to experience it, the magician must first create it on his asc ent up the Tree of Life. The name of DAATH is \"Knowledge.\" This is knowledge in the me rging sense, such as Adam knew Eve. It is \"gnosis,\" a personal experience of divini ty not"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"mediated by religious authorities. The experience is of mutual recogniti on between god and man. \"Knowledge\" is not a thing-in-itself; it is rightly denied a place on the tree...Knowledge, so far as it exists at all, even as a statement of relation, is no more than a momentary phenomena of consciousness. The proposition vanishes automatically as it is assimilated. (4) Therefore, this knowledge or access state, which is reached by uniting w ith one's Self, is the state of maximum information flow. One is, in that instant, a Babe i n the Abyss of the transcendent imagination ( Shekinah ). The gulf between a meditative procedure and the grace of God is crossed. When one is ignorant of the possibili ties, all symbols are equiprobable (i.e. THE FOOL). The vehicle of consciousness upgrades from Ruach to Neshamah, which is known through the Shekinah. Maximum information flow contains so much information that it appears as chaos . As soon as this \"Knowledge\" begins to be processed in images, we are dealin g with particularized information, not a concept or experience of Knowledge-as-a- body, per se. We are now dealing with relative quantities of information processin g. The processing is experienced as space/time. The practical application of the Stone has enormous value. It gives breadth and depth to one's magickal practice. According to Israel Regardie, The place of balanced power from which the working of the opposites may correctly be viewed, is the implication of Daas, [Daath]. It is shadowy and the word is used advisedly...for most have not cultivated the difficult art of avoiding the opposites...it is a new factor of adaptation or equilibrium, especially between the two broad divisions of consciousness--the ego on the one hand with its desire for adjustment to modern life with its refined and non-natural conditions, and on the other hand with the superficial levels of the instin ctual life, concerned with primitive things, of self-assertion, and the unbridle d gratification of its every whim and caprice. It is this new factor of adjustmen t which comprises the principle impetus to what has been called the Golden Flower, growth of the Red Rose upon the Cross of Gold, Stone of the Philosophers, medicine of metals. (5) Paradoxically, he says elsewhere Some Qabalists postulate a Sephirah named Daath, or Knowledge, as being the child of Binah and Chokmah, or a sublimation of the Ruach, supposed to appear in the Abyss in the course of man's evolution as an evolved faculty. It is a false Sephirah, however, and the Sepher Yetsirah, in anticipation, most emphatically warns us that 'Ten are the ineffable Sephiros. Ten and not nine . Ten and not eleven. Understand with Wisdom, and apprehend with care.' It is a non-existent Sephirah because, for one thing, Knowledge when examined contains within itself--as the progeny of Ruach--the same element of se lf- contradiction, and being situate in the Abyss, dispersion and so of self-"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"destruction. It is false, because as soon as knowledge is critically and logically analyzed, it breaks up into the dust and sand of the Abyss. The unity of the various faculties just mentioned, however, comprise s the Ruach which is called the Human Soul. (6) Saints tell us there are two parts to the experience of Daath. The lower one h as a downward tendency and creates the phenomenal world of the lower unive rse. This experience has to do with the subconscious mind of God, and has been term ed the Dark Night of the Soul. The other experience at this level is connected w ith Kether and draws us upward. The soul becomes pure and chaste (as symbolized by T HE HIGH PRIESTESS path) and loses worldly desires. It begins taking the p earls (pearls correspond to KEY II) of God's Holy Name. ALEPH/TAU reminds us that the Diamond Body Meditation is a circular proc ess of imagination. It does not run down (the process of radiation or entropy) because it draws continually from the free-energy of the archetypes themselves. I t is a form of alchemical circulatio. The Diamond Body Exercise is a geometrical description of Tiphareth. The V ector Equilibrium Matrix is an excellent metaphorical description of Daath . The V.E.M. permits conceptual coordination among opposites. It represents a sort of \"omnicomprehension.\" It is multi-directional. We might speculate t hat here there is \"zero-error\" and \"zero-time.\" Through this model, we experientially com prehend the word Universe. When one uses both ego- and anima-consciousness as alternatives, there is a nat ural balancing which occurs. Binocular vision includes the eye of both scien tist and mystic. The HIGH PRIESTESS represents the Anima Mundi or World Sou l. She is the channel for descending and ascending energies. This process is ete rnal and does not degrade because entropy and negentropy are produced equally. It is an interplay of chaos creating order, yielding to chaos for re-structuring, then c haos self-generating new order. A system holds together because it contains more gravitational coherence t han radiation of energy. This coherence is best described as the love of the variou s components for one another, whether they be sub-atomic particles, mole cules, humans, or gods. Disorder emerges because of entropy produced during ordering proces ses. Breaking down the old order makes room for entirely new systems and structures- -new order, which cannot come about without de-structuring. Order, in this sense , corresponds with explicate, ego-consciousness. This entropy emerges causally as the result of linear or directed thinking. Alchemical thinking is not linear, but ci rculatory. ________________________________________________________________________ _____"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"(1) Charles Boer and Peter Kugler, \"Archetypal Psychology is Mythical Re alism\" (2) J.

MEDITATIONAL USE OF THE DIAMOND BODY: CIRCULATIO Circulatio, or circulation of the light, combines the alchemical operati ons of sublimatio and coagulatio. Sublimation means generally to have an ennobling effec t, and coagulation means to solidify. During circulatio, one sublimates body and coagulates spirit. Circulation arou nd the aspects of being leads to an equilibrium where one is contained within the opposites. This containment is graphically shown with the Vector Equilibrium Matrix. This balancing is a delicate process. It must be performed by the ri ght person at the right time. Sublimatio consists of spirit and soul ascending from lower to higher in t he imaginal realm. Through it, the spirit hidden in matter becomes visible. Subl imatio is the alchemical form of resurrection. According to Edward Edinger, in EGO AND ARCHETYPE: Sublimatio, psychologically, is the process of raising concrete, personal experience to a higher level, a level of abstract or universal truth. Coagulatio, in contrast, is the concretization or personal realization of an archetypal image.(1) Sublimatio is a vertical, solar activity (represented in the Diamond Body as T HE MAGICIAN). Coagulatio is feminine, or lunar (represented by the HIGH PRIESTESS). Excess quantities of either of these potencies may have de structive effects. The solar-libido, which is creative and life-promoting, may be experienced as scorching dryness or fiery anger. The lunar-libido also has negative forms. Thes e modes of psychic energy have a wide range of power. The congealing, benumbing effect of the lunar quality is an extreme form of the feminine principle to promote coagulatio. Images and urges of a spiritual nature which would prefer to soar unfettered by the earth are obliged by the feminine Eros principle to become related to personal, concrete reality. If the ego is too far removed from such reality it will experience the encounter w ith the feminine as a paralyzing crash to earth."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"It can be quite helpful to realize that the damaging effects of the dangerous lunar power and the destructive solar power are, nevertheless, aspects of the Philosopher's Stone. When one is recuperating from the effects of an encou nter with either of these potencies, it helps in maintaining one's orientat ion and perspective to know that what he is suffering is from the Stone itself. Any one who would seek the Philosopher's Stone is bound, repeatedly, to be a victim of one of its partial aspects. These happenings constitute the alchemical operations which gradually bring about the transformation. But the operations are on ourselves.(2) Eventually (even-tau-ally), the solar-principle provides an increase in u nderstanding and an expanded field of awareness. The Stone's lunar portion materializ es elusive intuitions and spiritual potential. One submits willingly to the tr anspersonal totality of psyche. The royal marriage of THE MAGICIAN and HIGH PRIESTESS produces the Philosopher's Stone through circulation. Spirit penetrates soul, and soul envelops spirit. When spirit and sou l unite thoughts are immobilized. It is much like the moment of consummation in Sex Magic k. The soul \"crystallizes\", and becomes tuned to receive the divine. Spiri t becomes an effective influence in the personality. This is real-I-zation of the D iamond Body, or Self. The phenomena which used to be experienced as (eternal or intern al) light is now perceived as psychic revelation. Sublimatio means to raise or ennoble. Sublimatio is the vertical, Middle p ath and corresponds with the element Air. In QBL, Shekinah is the Middle Pillar. In psychology, alchemy and magick, it is the Anima Mundi . She mediates the ascents and descents of the soul and spirit. Through her, the ten spheres of the T ree of Life slowly sublimate into Kether, the Crown (and Primordial Air). The \"as cents and descents\" of the soul are characterized in ancient lore as Angels. An exam ple of this imagery is the story of Jacob's Ladder. The Supernal Triad (the top three spheres of the Tree of Life) repr esents the three aspects of knowledge: the Crown, Wisdom (the Knower), and Understanding ( that which is known). In Kether, the Crown, all opposites reside in total un ion. It reconciles oppositions which are distributed throughout the other sp heres. In alchemical thought, one may be redeemed through this self-knowledge . But there is great danger in direct revelation of the archetypal psyche. The danger lie s in calling up the pure archetype, which the ego-consciousness is never ab le to assimilate or integrate. If one succumbs to the disintegrative effect, the personality is annih ilated in the Abyss of the transcendent imagination. This dissolution has been liken ed to drowning. The alternate is release from the personal ego attitude and a pr o-active move toward participation within the archetypal dimension."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Dreams, active imagination, and the practice of Theurgy or Ceremonial Magick may all be seen as forms of coagulatio. In the process of circulatio, there is a resurrection of the Soul of Body. Images are an expedient mode of access to the knowledge of the soul, as it circulates rhythmically throughout every cell of the body. The body becomes subtle and spirit gains body. One is able to maintain daily functions in the ordinary world without losing intimate contact with t he archetypal dimension. In fact, this connectedness to daily life is essential to bal ance soul-travel in archetypal realms. Maintain ordinary pursuits except during the allotte d meditation period. This indirect penetration to the core-of-being produces fulfillm ent. One may use conscious, purposeful action to intentionally produce experience of unc onscious non-action which is purposeless. This is a natural preparation for death, t he experience of awareness without the constraints of time/space. The dynamic activity associated with ego-consciousness (the desire to know , to penetrate and illumine) culminates in a cessation of effort. The ration al process of controlling imagination defers to another power, the autonomy of the stream of consciousness. This experience of silence and tranquility is known as Sophia, or Divine Wi sdom. This means there is an emptying of the personal attachments of the ego. We th en experience a timeless incarnation of the universal aspect of being. The Merkabah mystics had one goal: entry into the throne-world of the Merkab ah, or Chariot of Fire (Diamond Body). They passed through the seven lowest spher es of the Tree of Life before they gained admittance. Using common shamanic methods to achieve a trance state, they sent their souls upward or downward to pier ce through the veil surrounding the Throne Chariot. The devotee sought nothing more than the vision of the Merkabah. No explicit doctrinal statements beyond accounts of their journeys to the heavens grew out of the experience, nor do we find the slightest hint of a developed system beyon d that of simple shamanism and the later involvement with magic. The Merkabah-rider did not attempt to see beyond the throne-kingdom or question its nature and origin. It was there. It was to be experienced, and nothing more...no specific mention is made about the precise nature of the transformation which the Merkabah-rider underwent.(3) These mystics threw their souls headlong into the fire of the Universe for no other reason than the desire to experience the Radiant Form of God. A practical example of meditational use of the Cube of Space (Diamond Bod y) is given by Gareth Knight, a contemporary British magician and Qabalist. He suggests the aspirant not waste time and energy in 'playing' with the symbols and sym bol systems instead of using them.

For instance, build the Cube of Space in the imagination with oneself stan ding in the centre. Concentrate on the six main directions initially and re flect on their general function and meaning. Then it becomes a matter of following one's nose. The details of the minor directions may be filled in. It may then well occur that certain figures may appear more or less spontaneously in any particular direction. These might be astrological figures, or Tarot pictures, or William Blake's four Zoas, or images quite independent of any known system. Simply take them for what they are worth and use them in the immediate context in which they arise. Our aim, when one crops up (say the Tarot Trump I, THE MAGICIAN, in the West), is to consider what it may mean--not to rush away and start to rack one's mentality on yet another mental construction of images or how to allocate al l the rest of the Trumps around the Cube. This is to substitute reason for intuition.(4) Just use the spontaneous image like an entry way and keep following your symbol s deeper and deeper, letting them unfold their hidden aspects. The magi cal approach to the use of the Diamond Body has a purpose other than the mystic's exper ience of the Divine. The magician taps into the Divine power to which he has gained ac cess. This enhances his ability to pursue the Great Work. We have our basic structure in the Cube of Space on which we have affixed the Hebrew letters and their immediately associated symbols. That is the fi xed central part of our magical generator. We need to let the other parts revolve around the fixed part if the generator is going to work. The principle is just like an electrical machine, a rotating coil and a fixed one, which can be used to convert motion to power or power to motion--it is a two-way energy converter in consciousness.(5) The restoration of the original unity (Kether) is a collective venture wh ich each individual must set out to accomplish for himself. This is not done thr ough an imitation of the life of a god or gods. It comes through fulfilling the Great Work which creates that unique reality which is the individual. Each indi vidual must experience the diverse aspects of his relationship with Divinit y, within the constraints of time/space. Polytheistic psychology would not suspend the commandment to have 'no othe r Gods before me,' but would extend that commandment for each mode of consciousness...polytheistic psychology obliges consciousness to circulate among a field of powers. Each God has his due as each complex deserves respect in its own right. In this circularity, there seem no prefer red positions.(6) [insert:CUBE OF SPACE WITH GODS & GODDESSES]"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The restoration of the exiled soul is our personal response-ability. Each i ndividual who does this makes a personal contribution to the content of the collect ive unconscious. The results get up-loaded on the \"psychic net.\" By means of this circulation, a \"spiritual earth\" is built up, a mystical b ody, which was identified both with man's resurrection body and with the worl d-spirit.(7) The function of imagination in this process is to make tangible the fact that matter in its subjective (expressive) aspect is spirit. Spirit, regarded ob jectively, is the material world. It is the world of limitation and repetitive cycles. The circular states of repetitiveness, turning and turning in the gyr es of our own conditions, force us to recognize that these conditions are our very ess ence and that the soul's circular motion (which is its native motion, according t o Plotinus) cannot be distinguished from blind fate. It is as if the soul free s itself not from blindness but by its continual turning in it. Ultimately, if the spontaneous mandala heals, it does so because it compels a recognition of the limitation of consciousness, that my mind and heart will turn only in a circle, and yet that same circle is my portion of an eternal necessity.(8) Circulatio is an economic psycho-feedback system which transforms ego- consciousness by recycling the content of its experience with archetyp al patterns. Psychofeedback is a method of controlling the human system (and only the human system) by both reinserting into it the results of past performance ( as with orthodox feedback concepts and by inserting into it the result of its prese nt performance or experience.(9) Rather than describing this process as one of control, it might be better understood as one of co-ordination. Both the ego-consciousness and the archetypal process es collaborate in the creation of the human ordering processes. This is mediat ed through the Anima, soul in body. In yet another modern rendition of alchemical thinking, Buckminster Fuller speaks of a type of circulatio in his Synergetic lingo: It is characteristic of \"all\" thinking--of all system's conceptioning-- --that all the lines of thought inter-relationships must return cyclically u pon themselves in a plurality of direction, as do various great circles around spheres. Thus may we interrelatedly comprehend the constellation--or system--of experien ces under consideration. Thus may we comprehend how the special-case economy demonstrated by the particular system considered also discloses the generaliz ed law of energy conservation of physical universe. \"Comprehension\" means identifying all the most uniquely economic al inter- relationships of the focal point entities involved...This is the way in whic h thought processes operate with mathematic logic.

ENTROPY AND REVERSABLE PROCESSES We may explore the concept of circulatio further by referring to the laws of thermodynamics. 1. THERMODYNAMIC LAWS"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Carl Jung was the first to propose a heuristic relationship of consciousn ess to the laws of thermodynamics in his attempt to understand the principles behind psyche. He believed that the psyche is capable of converting statistical organization s in a natural state to one of a 'higher' or 'unnatural' state. He referred to this i n alchemical terms as the opus contra naturam. These transitions, he stated were \"in opposition to entropy.\" An exploration of this tenet is extremely important to our understanding of t he Diamond Body Exercise. With a better understanding of these physical laws o f thermodynamics, visualizations and modeling can be thought of as beginning i n an equilibrium state, passing through some stage of non-equilibrium, and eve ntually ending in another state of equilibrium. Thermodynamics seeks to unde rstand these processes. An ideal process is called a reversible process. This process is theor etically classified as a change in the state of a system which goes through a continuous succession of equilibrium states. At no point does the system experience a stage of non- equilibrium. The first law of thermodynamics denies the possibility of creating or destroying energy. That is the so-called conservation of energy law. Libido is seen as that energy related to consciousness. It is that 'psychic' energy which psyche must conserve. Libido is the motivational energy for life processes. The second law of thermodynamics, as a macroscopic concept, states that th ere is a tendency on the part of nature to proceed toward a state of greater disorder. The greater the disorder, the greater the entropy. A reversible process has a zero change in entropy. This can also mean that there is a negative entropy, or negentropy. Entropy is a concept which describes the \"usable\" aspect of energy. To un derstand this better, visualize a heat source at one end of a closed room. At an early stage , we can state that the entropy of the room is low in that all the heat is at the sour ce- point. As time increases, the heat flows into other parts of the room. Alth ough the energy (total heat) has remained constant, the entropy, or order of the energy h as decreased. It is now more difficult to do work (like boil water). Entrop y is a measure of the disorder of energy. It has been emphasized that work, as defined in thermodynamics, is a mac roscopic concept. Haphazard motions of individual molecules against intermolecular forces do not constitute \"work.\" Work always involves order or orderly motion. The entropy of a system is measured by the macroscopic degree of molecular di sorder existing in the system. When the entropy of an isolated system increases, th e system is proceeding from a state of lower to a state of higher probability. The second law of thermodynamics is therefore only seen as a statistical law. An example of this important distinction can be described via the condu ction of heat from a hot stove to a kettle of water. The second law asserts, not that heat must f low from the stove to the water, but that it is highly probable that heat will flo w from"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"the stove to the water. Individual molecules can flow in the other direc tion, like in a gaseous state. It is understood that there is always a chance that the reverse may take place, on a microscopic scale. The second law of thermodynamics shows the most probable course of events, not the only possible ones. At critical points near, but not at, absolute zero, there is an abrupt change or s hift in laws, from statistical to quantum. Superconductivity and superfluidi ty experiments demonstrate conditions where laws of probability do not operate. It is th e removal of entropy which allows the simplicity of the laws covering nearly perfect order to be seen in manifestation. Such laws are of a different order than macrosc opic statistical laws. The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is a visual tool to bridge macroscopic str uctures into quantum modes. It graphically depicts the sphere, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere (now-here). It can be used as an acc ess tool for realizing multiple quantum ordering. 2. ORDER AND CHAOS"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"To begin to understand this form of order, a new tool for perception is neede d. The new concepts of order involve the discrimination of the relative differe nces in time and space (and similarities). Attention should now be given to similar di fferences and different similarities. Such a format in mathematics is calle d a ratio, or matrix field. According to Professor David Finkelstein of Yeshiva University, \"T he universe is a cosmic computer on the pregeometric level of information in which space and time appear as secondary statistical constructs.\" The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is such a matrix field. Although seen as a geometry at any stage, it is pregeometric in that it describes the change from one s tage to the next. It is a quantized state of information. Physicist, David Bohm illustrates these notions of ratios in terms of a simp le geometric curve. By approximating this curve with a series of straight-li ne segments of equal length, a ratio can be stated to define this curve. This curve has only one independent difference, that of being a space displacement as the st raight-line segments curve on a flat plane. A circle could be described similarly, except that the segments can vary in direction as well as position. This ratio now describes a curve of the second class. A hel ix creates a curve of the third class, when the angle between lines can tu rn in a third dimension. This is an example of various kinds of similarities in the di fferences. In the above example of curves, the similarity (or ratio) between successi ve steps remains invariant. A new set of curves can now be described, where this si milarity is different. The segment-lengths now vary. This leads us to consider not onl y similar differences but also different similarities of the difference . As the degree becomes indefinitely high, we now can describe what is commonly referred t o as \"random curves.\" Now, by quantizing our system of variance, we have have ordered a \"random\" event. This kind of curve is not determined by any finite number of steps. Ne vertheless, it would not be appropriate to call it \"disordered,\" having no order whatsoever. Rather, it has a certain kind of order, one which is of an indefinable high d egree. We no longer use the term \"disorder,\" but rather distinguish between d ifferent degrees of order, some of which are deterministic chaos. Order is not to b e identified with predictability; it is found in the connectivity of two events. The m echanism used to identify an \"event\" is most revealing. Insight is the percepti on (or psychological equivalent) of a certain type of resonance. This specific form of ordering (insight) has meaningful implication to the individual experi encing it. Intelligence is a sequence of such insights, leading to purpose and pr actical behavior. This resonance allows for the transference of information from an implicat e order to the explicate order. Since the total of the explicate is encoded throug hout the implicate order, the resonance provides a direct access or return to p syche. This resonance is called a \"complex.\""},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 3. COMPLEXES AS REPAIR FUNCTIONS: A complex is the interaction, in time and space, of an individual with an ar chetype. It is a personal experience. The archetype is \"interfering\" with the h uman part of life. Conscious awareness is altered through the experience. The mor e consciousness differentiates among the complexes, the more negentropic the eff ect. There is a decrease in entropy. A complex provides information from the archetypal dimension that facilitates adaptation, healing, and evolution. If a system changes such that a spontaneous increase in disorder (determi nistic chaos) will bring the system back to its original state, then the state m ay be defined as orderly and thereby associated with an increase in negentropy (decrease i n entropy). The complex becomes a way to bring the system back to its \"original\" state. The ordering principle allows the transfer of information from psyc he to consciousness. Psyche's energy is continuous. Its \"quantum-like\" n ature is seen as a complex, or group of complexes. The entropy of all macrocosmic structures increases in time. To reverse the natural degradation which eventually occurs, an ordering process capable of returnin g the system to its original state is required. This process can be thought of as a \"repair function.\" Living things routinely incorporate self-repair systems within the ir structures. Immortality of any system is, in principle, feasible only if its repair syst em is not irreversibly impaired. If an impairment can be identified, restoration to its original structure must be accomplished by performing work. These functi ons require the search for, and then application of, specific information. A complex is a sour ce for these specifics. In these formats lie the nature of the differences (and similarit ies) in which energy is viewed. Energy is the scalar quantity which is measured on a relative scale . Present convention equates zero energy to the absence of any observable forms of ener gy. But there is a seething ocean of scalar energy just below the level of observati on. As our worldview shifts from the statistical to the quantum, we find th at our ordering models lead to a concept of of abundant or infinite energy (or potential). There is an absence of any observable forms of energy within the Vector Equilibrium Matrix. Thus, this center is an idealized state for negent ropy because it contains unobservable virtual (scaler) energy which can be \"translate d\" or \"transduced\" into 4-dimesional reality. 4. REVERSIBLE PROCESSES This energy does not exist in the uniform continuum, but in association wi th structures within structures. Macroscopic systems are universall y irreversible and mortal. Their internal disorder spontaneously increases over an extended period of time. Some basic structural component of the elementary particles appe ars to be"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"universally immortal and reversible. The key seems to be in the quantum vi ewpoint. As our model becomes smaller and smaller, the access to negentropic or dering becomes greater. The Vector Equilibrium Matrix represents a \"repair function\" or ordering on a quantum level. The Diamond structure represents an immortal body, with t he V.E.M. describing the geometrical way in which this structure revers es itself. With this set of visual tools, the existence of an infinite source of negentropy i s now available. The existence of an infinite source of negative energy permeating the unive rse constitutes a plenum. Within the very vacuum of space there are observable properties, as Dirac indicates: \"Infinite sea of negative energy.\" It is n ow possible, with a hierarchical view of matter, to give an operational definition to this pot ential. Therefore, we define Nuit, goddess of Infinite Space as the sum of all u nobservable forms of energy that exist in the microcosm beyond our observable limits. It is a plenum, not a \"matter-free\" state. It is not the V.E.M. which is importan t, but its center which is everywhere present, Nuit. 5. THE ALCHEMY OF ENTROPY"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The amount of energy in a system that is available for work is called Gibb's fr ee energy. The conscious will is the ego's \"free energy.\" It is continuously s ubject to degradation of value by psyche's entropic function. This dissociability of psyche diffuses the ego. The more consciousness differentiates, the more o rganization is given to ego as free energy. This access of free-energy can create a negentropic effect, thereby re-ordering that which was in disorder. This is the complexity of the interaction between ego and archetypes. When the archetypes create chaos, it is for re-structuring in a new form. T his de- constructing is called solutio or liquification of consciousness in al chemy. It is the necessary pre-requisite for the completely new image. When the ego un dergoes solutio, the pathway to the new self has opened. One proceeds down that pathway through the alchemical process called im aginatio. This indicates an abstraction from concentration and active fantasy. This so -called \"free energy\" can exist quite independent of the ego. It is also a product of the Self. Sublimatio is the process of raising physical and personal experiences to a higher or more abstract level. It is an elevation of perspective, an ascension in view point. It means that what was once taken literally, such as the body, is now perceived i n a more subtle way. The body itself becomes subtle, another venue for psyche an d the imaginal life. As an ordering process, sublimatio leaves the explicate and ent ers the implicate realm. Free-energy comes into time when it leaves the arc hetypal world. Sublimatio is the raising of material from the bottom of a vessel. The diffe rence between a neurosis and a sublimation is that a neurosis isolates; a sublim ation unites. Something new is created, and negentropic potential becomes avail able. Through sublimation, the spirit hidden in matter now becomes visible. \" Primitive thinking,\" or anima-consciousness, is more suited to maintaining opposi tes in harmony while this ordering process continues along mythical patterns. It might be thought of as an archetypal ordering process. When disorder is not ordered by archetypal processes, it falls to the ego. When chaotic energy is ordered by archetypes, it is drawn to them because they are strange attractors. A middle path between \"primitive thinking\" and directed (ego) thought points to the type of sublimation which Jung speaks of in AION. The ego system has a \"linear form\" or segment of time irreversibility implanted as a result of direc ted thinking and the historical development of the self. A relationship between th e ego and the self is possible through the transcendent function. This is not bu ilt up by directed thinking, but rather with the negentropic source: imagination. IV. CONTEMPORARY APPLICATIONS "},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"A. ARCHETYPAL TOPOLOGIES: Active participation in the realm of the imagination is central to psychology, alc hemy, magick, and physics. Many, but not all of the imaginal modes involve the concept of topology or topography. Within the context of the topological fantasy, the various forms of ordering (Tree of Life, the Diamond Body, the V.E.M., etc.) provide a comprehe nsive means of ascertaining the values of any system of experiences. Topology is the science of fundamental pattern and structural relationshi ps of event constellations. It was discovered and developed by the mathematician Euler . He discovered that all patterns can be reduced to three prime conceptual characteri stics: to lines; points where two lines cross or the same line crosses itself; and areas, bounded by lines.(1) While active invoking of images is essential to the practice of QBL, it is bes t to balance this through a detached observation/participation in the rising and passing away of phenomena. Topographical models are paradigms, but they should not be considere d ultimate truths, but as allowing access to imaginal realms. While topography is a useful tool, it is also an archetypal perspective. For example, I suggest that a perspective which sees the necessity for 'arch etypal topographies' is just one among many. We must not be drawn into literalism at s uch a profound level. As I mention above, Casey seems to imply a single natural ordering f or a particular purpose, within a specific archetypal influence. Examination of th e variety of such attempts to pattern and group archetypes is itself a valuable exercise in exploring archetypal imagination. What kind of consciousness is it that perceive s in terms of organization, integration and preferred positioning of Gods? Generally, the attempt to discover a unifying wholeness or impose a distinct pattern onto arc hetypal groupings is a procedure dominated by the archetype of the Self.(2). QBL is a single philosophical system which accommodates both monotheism and polytheism. These topologies may be used in conjunction with a polytheist ic orientation in which consciousness circulates among a field of powers. Each god, or complex i s sovereign in its domain. There is a circulation in which there are no preferred pos itions. The danger in identification with the archetype of the Self is persi stent belief in it as the \"only\" reality. Archetypal images of order (mandalas) counter disintegr ation. However, there is sometimes a psychic value in disintegration. It brings immedi ate awareness of distinct separateness among the pantheon of archetypal forces. Both attit udes, monotheism and polytheism, represent forms of living reality in the phenomenal world . Topology offers a descriptive basis for both meditation and exploration of the i maginal realm. The importance of the act of decision for behavior or transformation lies mainly in the fact that by it the individual changes his position. A \"path\" is a change of position within a field which otherwise remains sufficiently constant. It i s an abbreviated representation of a sequence of situations."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"A path permits changes between regions. This is both conceptual and phys ical change. The actions which are represented in the life-space as regions are coexist ing manifolds which possess a certain degree of differentiation. These \"regions\" are the sph eres of the Tree of Life. The imaginal paths of the Tree of Life are linked to the concept of locomotion . They require \"working\" by the aspirant in a process in time. The psychological r egion in which these processes occur determines the dynamic condition of the ind ividual. Pathworking is a form of \"loco-motion,\" akin to the \"illumined lunacy \" Hillman describes as the royal marriage, the pre-requisite for the Stone. It is 0, THE FOOL wh o makes the journey through the winding paths of the Tree of Life via Tarot imagery. He is nowhere (now-here) because of his ability to makes quantum leaps. He is everywher e at once, until we make an observation by using the cards. He is thus gripped by only one story at a t ime, which contains many images and its own inherent rhythm. When one changes position, different loco-motions are now possible and imposs ible. Even when a region is still attainable, the course of the path followed has change d fundamentally because of the new point of departure. This part that you are now is \"where you ar e at.\" THE FOOL is a breath-spirit, and Anima is a breath-soul. This relates the m intimately to the airy realm of imagination. Just as the Fool circulates around the paths of the T ree, anima circulates throughout every cell of the body. The attributions of these entities leads us in a definite direction : they both focus attention on the breath. The importance of breath in human life and mystical meditation is not to be underestimated. The use of breath control has a long-standing tradition i n magical and yogic practice. There is a relationship between meditation states and r hythmic breathing. If we look further into our Qabalistic modeling, we should find the heart p laying a prominent role in this process.

It can be seen as a for m of training for the mind in switching from matter to psyche. There is a purpose. It is to prepare the personal nature so that it is able to reflect and express its relationship with the Universal Self. Throughout history there have been a number of techniques used to achieve a meditative state. The most often used first step is a form of rhythmic breathing. If done correctly, a sequence of strong and unusual body reactions occur. These also will event ually trigger unusual psychological states via a type of resonance effect. A closer examinati on of these resonance-relationships yields information useful in improving the me ditation. Perhaps an example clarifies this: When a subject is totally relaxed and has achieved a deep meditative state, a slow, rhythmic sine wave pattern can be register ed by a cardiograph-type sensing device. What is being measured is a standing wave in th e aorta. There is a heart-aorta resonating oscillator which affects other parts of th e body, including the brain. Resonance occurs when the natural vibration frequency of a body is greatly amp lified by vibrations at the same frequency from another body. Oscillators alter the en vironment in a periodic manner. When in a deep meditative state the regular movement of th e body indicates that a standing wave is set up in the vascular system, specifical ly in the aorta. This standing wave affects several other resonate systems in the body, all of which are driven by this large signal. A paper by Paul F.J. New, and several current papers, indicate the presence of a major resonate cavity oscillator located between the heart and the bifurcation, wh ere the aorta divides itself. When the timing of the pressure pulses traveling down the aorta coincide (in phase) with the reflected pressure pulse, a standing wave is achieved . When this frequency approaches 7Hz., a progressively amplified wave form is created by resonance , resulting in a large oscillation affecting every other circuit in the body tuned to this f requency."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"There is a resonance relationship to this frequency with standing wave s on the Earth's crust. If we assume that the spherical crust of the Earth represents a condenser, then the frequency of resonance can be calculated on the basis of the equation: Resonance frequency = C/7.3R2 Where C is the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves and R = radius of t he Earth. This frequency has been shown to be 6.4Hz. Thus, a harmonic frequency corresponding to the pulsation of the electr ical charge of the Earth is present in heart/aorta. The brain may be considered as a piezoelectric gel3, one converting physical vi brations into electrical ones. Although the body movement from this heart/aorta resonanc e is relatively small, 0.003-0.009 mm., the head is a dense and tight structure. By moving up and dow n, the skull accelerates the brain with mild impacts. These acoustical plane waves are reflected from the cranial vault and are focused upon the third and late ral ventricles. A hierarchy of frequencies couple this 7Hz. body movement to the higher f requencies in the ventricles.

Taittiriya Upanishad In the book Biomedical Engineering Systems 4, Chapter 7 is a major work entitled \"Toward A View of Man\", by Manfred Clynes. Clynes is a medical doctor working at the Res earch Center in Rockman State Hospital, Orangeburg, New York. This work is consi dered a breakthrough in the fields of psychology and medicine, known today as the fie ld of psychobiology (biocybernetics). Clynes took a number of volunteers and shaved their heads, placing a series of e lectrodes in rosette patterns or various regions of the brain. These included the temp oral, frontal lobe section and occipital region. In this way, not only were the brain frequenc ies monitored, but directional shifts in these frequencies could also be determ ined by the geometry of the electrodes on the scull. The original purpose of Clynes' work was to find out how precision and order exist in brain processes; to discover what is inherently programmed in man and ho w he might make use of the inherent programs. These individuals were given a number of images (form) and colors to conce ntrate on while their brain was monitored by computers. Recording from opposite pairs of el ectrodes simultaneously, he obtained views of the electrical activity from diffe rent angles: mathematically, a spatial differentiation of the electric vector. What was h appening literally was a mapping of consciousness. A number of very important observation s were made:"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"1. Certain qualities and relationships were of greater importance to the c omputer than such quantitative factors such as intensity. This meant that the brai n's systems of identification are based on differences, rather than intensity of the signal. 2. Thin lines were found to produce characteristic evoked potentials, ir respective of size. The form itself is transduced into another form in the brain space time which can be measured. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the visual form of the stimulus, the response form in the brain, and the perception. This is, perhaps, the first physical description of the field of an archetype. It is a geometrical, structuring and has uniqueness. 3. The process of inhibition is as important for transducing the external w orld as is excitation. Concentrating on specific lines of geometry does not constitu te the changing stimulus, but their steady presence systematically and radic ally alters the response to another changing stimulus. 4. Changes in intensity of a single color produce very simple response shape . Light and darkness (as opposites) show no evidence of being different values of th e same variable. Rather, they seem to be the result of stimulating and also of inhibi ting different receptors. Thus, the evoked potentials to light and darkness i n no way may be said to be positive and negative, respectively. White, for example, appears in t his view as the result of mutual inhibition of color. 5. These experiments clearly imply an inherent form of organization and not a random learning of nerve nets. It is possible to mentally recognize and per ceive the stimulus within the first portion of the invoked potential. Portion s responding (in the brain) which occur later than 0.3 sec. are seen as systematic processe s, or tuned circuits to those responses to specific in-coming stimulus. This is a form of resonance in the brain to specific geometry. This could also lead to the formation of m emory. 6. Every perception has a unique counterpart as a space-time code form in th e brain. These space-time shapes are evidence of relationships between the external world and its representation in the brain. They act like keys to \"unlock\" s pecific parts of our brain, often being observed below psychological threshold leve ls (subliminal). Clynes literally mapped fields in the human brain. A computer was able to i dentify and reproduce those geometrical figures from what that human was concentrati ng on, either as a geometric form or color. The individual did not even have to look at the patter n but simply concentrate \"in his mind's eye.\" A standing wave means that the wave is not changed, but is holding itself steady in one certain geometrical thought. If quantum mechanical properties of matter are actually the conscious property of matter, then one would predict that all phenomena where quantum wave explanations ar e important, the phenomena could be interpreted better in terms of con sciousness.5"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Our planet is surrounded by a layer of electrically charged particles calle d the ionosphere. The lower layer of the ionosphere starts about 80km. from the Earth. This charge s layer is known to reflect radio waves. Since this is a highly charges layer, the ionosphere forms a so-called capac itor with the Earth. This means that there is a difference in electrical potential between the two, the Earth being negatively charged and the ionosphere being positively charged. Thi s potential varies somewhat but is around 200 volts/m. This is a fundamental type of electrical generator. The solar winds, inter acting with the upper atmosphere rotation, act as a collector and brushes of a generator. The l ower atmosphere can be seen as a storage battery for this gradient potential. This electromagnetic field around the Earth can be viewed as a stiff je lly. When our bodies move and vibrate, these movements are transmitted to the environment. Th ese fields not only impinge on our body but they also affect the charges inside our body. When we are standing on the ground, under normal conditions, we are grounded. Our body the n acts as a sink for the electrostatic field and we actually distort the force lines somewhat. Our body also has its own electrostatic field about itself. These field -lines are the result of the various biochemical reactions in the body. This resultant bio-field couples us to the isoelectric field of the planet. A \"tuned system\" consists of at least two oscillators of identical resonan ce frequencies. If one of the oscillators starts emitting, the other will be activated by the signal very shortly. Because the coupling is ideal, they will respond to the tiniest signal s and begin to resonate. In 1957, W.O. Schumann6 calculated the Earth-ionosphere cavity resonance freque ncies. His works were updated over the years and the figure now used is at 7.5Hz. A s indicated previously, the micromotion of the body is about 6.8 to 7.5Hz. It is obvious that when one is in deep meditation, it is possible for th e human being and the planet system to start resonating. There is a transfer of energy. It is no coinci dence that this frequency is in the theta region of brainwaves, the state of maximum regene ration. Information is embedded in a field, rather than just being a field. A fie ld is thus an abstract quantity of information; relationships between this point and that poi nt in the universe. Astral temples are set up to evoke a certain correspondence effect, lik e a resonance. These temples are like a physical matrix, one with specific geometrical form an d color. The visualization, in turn sets up a particular EM resonance in the brain. T he reverberation pattern is most explicit. Clarity is all important. Distort ion minimizes the resonance effect and reduces any amplification to connecting other \"tune d\" oscillators in the body. Techniques of extending this harmonious resonance have been known for t housands of years. These are the different meditative techniques. Most slow dow n the metabolic rate of the body so that much less oxygen is required to keep the body going."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"As one becomes proficient in meditation, the breathing becomes so gent le as not to disturb the resonate state of the aorta. An automatic process develops in which the lungs and the diaphragm regulates the heart-aorta system so as to keep them well-tuned . This helps extend the resonant behavior even with shallow breathing. In conclusion, the following points should be made regarding the res onant effects available through meditation: 1. There is a heart/aorta resonance which links up with a number of other cr itical oscillators, including several in the brain. It starts at the heart. 2. Specific geometries or geometrical mandalas (form and color) create re sonance effects in the brain. The pattern is repeated in the brain. 3. Specific geometrical systems can be used as \"keys\" to access those speci fic archetypes. Access occurs to the psyche. 4. This linking of resonant cavity oscillators can be seen to form a common thre ad, going from Hadit (DNA-RNA helix) to Nuit (galactic hydrogen-helium field) . 5. By \"tuning\" one's meditation, it is possible to amplify and have access to the other resonant systems, in and out of the body. The Human organism has usually been regarded as a complex arrangement of chemic al elements and compounds. The quantity and structure of these variables ar e our reference points for states of health. This is the area of biochemistry and biochemic al analysis. An equally valid approach is to regard the human organism as an aggregation of electromagnetic fields which are constantly interacting and changing as are their biological equivalents. It has been shown that the human system is an emitter of elec tromagnetic radiations.7 All biological processes are a function of electromagnetic field interact ions. EM fields are the connecting link between the world of form and resonant patterns. The patterns are arbitrary forms which are non-physical. Archetypal forms ar e based on inherent characteristics and correspondences. This provides a basis for what we would call resonant phenomena in archetypal systems. EM fields embody or store gestalts , patterns of information. An archetype may then be seen as a specific geometrical system of standin g waves occurring in the brain as a space-time shape (\"key\"). In living organisms, opposites receive their structure of symmetry from p articular combinations of spatial and temporal aspects. Like reins on a horse, each of th e opposites of the psychological pair has its own place. This geometric property makes them capable of being opposites. The activity of each arm determines the quantity; the sp atial identity of the rein determines the quality. There is no monotonic (or linear) tr ansition from one to the other passing through zero."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"A human being, immersed in the galactic hydrogen-helium field, may also uti lize the pulsing feedback between man and the galaxy to build up the resonance effe cts, much like we would tune a radio. These primary frequencies are multiples of th e base frequency 7 Hz. These four nucleotides provide resonant frequencies for alpha, theta, an d delta (the characteristic brain states going from consciousness to deep sleep: 14-2 H z.). This resonance relationship can be seen to link with helium inside th e body at various chemical sites. The bridge connecting the solar system resonances and the brain frequen cies seem to reside in the DNA-RNA helix. In a paper by Oliver Reiser (8) from the University of Pittsburgh, a relati onship is developed between the four helium cores in an atomic nucleus and the m atrix forms on the DNA and RNA. Reiser describes them as \"radiation belts of thought,\" t he four \"nucleotides\" enter into the dynamics of these nuclear properties . A spheron is a nuclear constituent roughly spherical in shape and spaced in concentric layers. The platonic solids are the five regular solids described by Pythagoras, now s een to form all crystal formations. These forms later became the basis of the mathematic s known as group theory. The so-called \"resonances\" were specific combinations of five regular solids geometry. \"Helions\" is Pauling's term for spherons when he modeled the heliu m in the sun, the heliosphere around the Earth, and the hydrogen-helium plasma of the galact ic disc. An optically activated molecule, such as helium, contains an electron which is coerced into a helical path by electric field. This one-sided spiral is maintained in the intermolecular transport through protein molecules. Note that the protein units of \"sp herical viruses\" are packed symmetrically, in accordance with the pattern of cubic symmetry. On ce more we find our way back to Pythagoras and the Platonic solids. ______________________________________________________________________________ _______ 1. Paul F.J.

MAGICAL USE OF STANDING WAVES AND GEOMETRICAL MATRICES It is now evident that every stimulus form corresponds to a particular spac e-time shape in the brain, in terms of electrical activity. A computer can even now ident ify these shapes. These space-time shapes are evidence of relationships between the external world and its representation in the brain."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"We have chosen to call these spatio-temporal representations \"keys.\" The se keys seem to operate on \"locks\" in our brain in a manner similar to \"minting\" of DNA prod uction and replications. Magick is practiced fundamentally for the creation of the mystical or immor tal body. This subtle body is also known as the Diamond Body or Philosopher's Stone. It is in dependent of time and space and can be seen as a magickal mode of transportation for conscious ness. By tuning in on specific keys, access to specific brain-chemical relation ships are available. Archetypes may be seen as these specific geometrical systems of standi ng waves, occurring in the brain as space-time shapes or keys. Resonance effects aid and amplify these standing waves, with specific r esults. One may speculate on minimizing the size of one's mystical body, moving consciousnes s into another dimension, via the energy flows of singularities. Conceptually, it is a useful model to picture the vehicles of consciousne ss becoming smaller as we rise on the Planes. If you picture your carrier of consciousness as synon ymous with the smallest available models--massless particles--you are no longer limi ted by the mechanistic laws of the universe. You enter the possibilities of th e quantum field. Further, these models also provide resonance with other parts of the body. Information is embodied in a field, rather than just being a field. The ge ometrical images are basically an abstract quantity of information; a field relationship betwe en one point and another in the universe. Unlike most engineering channels of commu nication, biological channels are dynamically asymmetric. Information on change is transm itted across space asymmetrically with respect to the direction of the change of the variable. This means that if a biological system is to be informed symmetrically abou t dynamic changes, it requires two channels. The basic reason for this dynamic asymm etry is that biological channels for control use the concentration of molecules to tran smit information at some point along the channel (for example, neurotransmitter release). T his must involve asymmetry since the creation and transportation of molecules is generally acc omplished by different means from their breakdown and removal. Concentration can be made a function of information as long as the change requi res an increase in concentration. Decreasing concentration generally cannot be ac complished as fast through the same channel. The level of hormones which have issued into t he bloodstream cannot be decreased through the action of the same gland. A decr ease in concentration is produced by metabolic processes or through the increas e in level of counteracting hormone or chemical. In either case, the decrease in conc entration is produced through quite different channels from the one producing an increase in concentration. The significance of this asymmetry of unidirectional rate sensitivity i n the space-time patterns in the brain is that if it were not for this principle, inte raction and cancellation of opposites would prevent the formation of unique space-time patterns for each perception. An event is registered as a pattern in space as well as a pattern in time. Wit h the sense of touch, for example, removal does not cancel the sensation, even when the touch w as short"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"and momentary. A distinction can be thus made between quality and quant ity. Quality is given by the channel location, quantity by the firing pattern in the channel . In living organisms opposites receive their structure of symmetry from a particular combination of spatial and temporal aspects. It is the geometric propert ies which makes them capable of being opposites. This \"rein control\" implies distin ction between quality and quantity. With each rein, messages are similar and not opposite in character . The activity of each \"rein\" determines the quantity, the special identit y of the \"rein\" determines the quality. Archetypes influence our human lives in this way also. They intrude up on the patterns of one another, and help balance out our one-sided attitudes. Sometimes this h appens through the shadow, sometimes it is an inspiration of the Self. In this way archet ypes transform from simple information, into image, into energy, into natural consequences i n the real world. Any view of the universe is an interplay between information and energy. By inf ormation we mean those processes which provide recognition and identification of separate existences, and by energy the transformation and displacement of the conte nts of space. This interplay between information and energy involves identity, quality an d recognition. One point of entry into manifestation for archetypes is through our thought s and intentionality. Whichever comes first, the archetype or the neurotran smitter, thoughts become things. The neurotransmitter is the chemical link betwee n apparent nothing and something in the human domain. Even more fundamental is the sub-atomic pr ocess of probability underlying and conditioning the process. This probability i tself is archetypal-- probably Hermetic. It is the contention of this book that the most fundamental geometric form is the Vector Equilibrium Matrix (VEM). This geometrical form leads directly to the Diamond Body or Cube of Space. To place oneself inside this structure, or to project th is matrix form outward as a visualization, or to climb into a virtual reality depiction of the VEM, c reates and generates a resonance within the space-time shapes of the brain. Th e Vector Equilibrium Matrix is a geometrical mandala--a solid state mandala--res onating with the psychological analog for the Philosopher's Stone. A state of grace can be achie ved where the key word is Access. "},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"The psychological response from the resonance created from visualizin g oneself inside the Vector Equilibrium Matrix is Daath. The Astral Temple of Daath is evoked by the following visualization sequen ce: 1. A banishing ritual is critical, including a visualization of the containin g circle. 2. A Middle Pillar Exercise. This sets up the centers for resonance and t he foundation points for the Vector Equilibrium Matrix, connecting each c enter. Chakra colors are important at this point. 3. A vertical line should now be envisioned, acting as an axis or Middle Pillar li ne through each of the chakra points. 4. Now, focus on the two chakra points corresponding to the heart (Tiphareth) an d the center of the forehead (Daath). These two points become centers for t wo intersecting circles, (see Figure 1). 5. Connect overlapping points (from the circumferences of the circles) with vertical lines. These are the side Pillars. Now begin to visualize a Tree of Life, (se e Figure 2). 6.

Ezekiel 1:16 The mathematical zone of neutral resonance occurs at the centers of each cube, visualized as Tiphareth and Daath. This allows Nuit into the visualization as the heart of the Diamond Body, that which is naught. The heart-aorta resonating oscillator link with the brain can be activated by tuning both brain-waves and heart rate to meditational mode. As t his system becomes \"tuned,\" an ideal coupling occurs and a link with the earth-ion osphere is achieved. It is at this point that specific geometrical manipulations create a se ries of \"gates\" or \"keys,\" and access then occurs to specific archetypes. Direct access to p syche is available and Daath is experienced on the psychological level as gnosis.

It is th e geometric form within which the primitive Vector Equilibrium forms. The V ector Equilibrium centers on a nexus point within the subtle net known as the I.V.M.

T hey are the path of least resistance which is always favored in natural processes. They are not only the way energies are likely to move, but the way they \"like\" to do it. The conceptual asp ect of the geometry is simply a way for our minds to grasp the process. Fuller contend s that even our thoughts are tetrahedronally conveyed in our gray matter.

Ezekiel 1:22 "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Magick and yoga are the two major divisions of Mysticism. One is exaltive, the other reflective. Through the correspondence system, Magick seeks to exalt th e imagination and the soul. Yoga provides a discipline through which the mind may be emptie d of its contents at will. The aspirant becomes a mystic when he is favored with an immediate expe rience of the divine. This experience of ultimate reality is so awesome that he strives to attain further heights of ecstasy and holy rapture. The True Will of a mystic is to merge into Godhead at Ket her. The vision of the Diamond Body, or Throne Chariot, is a mystical experience pos sible on this path. In magickal practice, the Altar is placed in the very center of the magickal circle. This makes the Altar the pivot-point of all operations. The Altar represent s the True Will of the magician. It is the physical representation of his intent. All the other magical weapons are arrayed on the altar. The Wand represents th e Will of the creative self; the Cup is intuition, the Sword indicates the qu alities of the mind, and the Pentacle represents the physical body. The proper use and direc tion of these weapons depends upon the Altar. The intent of the celebrant is critical to the proper use of his faculties. This is a law under which he works. Only the Lamp, hanging overhead, is exempt from this prescription. This is b ecause it represents the inextinguishable light from above, that of the Higher Sel f, and is not subject to the desires of the magician, except his desire for self-transformat ion. The Altar is a geometrical construction in the form of a vertically-position ed Double Cube. It embodies the magician's knowledge of the laws of Nature. The Altar is a double cube, which is a rough way of symbolizing the Great Work; for the doubling of the cube, like the squaring of the circle, was one of the great problems in antiquity. The surface of this Altar is composed of ten squares. The top is Kether, and the bottom Malkuth. The height of the Altar is equal to the height above th e ground of the navel of the Magician. The Altar is connected with the Ark of the Covenant, Noah's Ark, the nave (navis, a ship) of the Church, and many other sym bols of antiquity...(1) [insert The Double Cube: Magickal Altar] The Altar, the central shrine of the temple, in the form of the double cu be, is derived from the geometry of the Tree of Life, itself. When the double cube Altar is s uperimposed over the geometry of the Tree of LIfe, it coordinates Spheres 1-9, Kether through Yesod. There are centralized nexus points at Sphere 6, Tiphareth (the Heart) and D aath. The true Temple consists of the body/soul (Sphere 10, Malkuth) of the magician in coordination with the transformative matrix provided by the Tree. Magician s and yogis have always considered the body to be their Temple.

The resonance effect produced by this means is described by the Qabali stic axiom: Kether is in Malkuth; and Malkuth is in Kether. We can examine each section of the double cube separately. When the geomet ry of the Tree is superimposed over the human form, the bottom cube centers in the re gion of the heart. The top cube centers in the middle of the brain, in that region known as the 3rd Eye. See Figure .

Daath would be linked with the pituitary and pineal glands, Tiphareth with the heart and lungs, Yesod with the gonads, etc. The two cubes interface at the throat (thyroid gland). This r eflects the associations of chakras and glands in yoga. The bottom cube centers in Tiphareth, Beauty. It contains the geometry of the Diamond Body. It is formed by joining the centers of the six plane-faces of the cube. C onnect the vertices to form an octahedron. Fill in the Bravis lattice. It may help to mak e several xerox copies, and color the forms in different colors, until you can internalize them and rotate them in your mind. The top cube is Daath, the Mystical Sephirah, or Upper Room. The nexus point of this cube is Knowledge or Gnosis, the Cosmic Downloading Channel, uplink to the Arche typal. The Vector Equilibrium joins the centers of the lines forming each pl ane face. The center of the V.E.M. coincides with resonant neural cavities in the center of the brain.

DAATH: THE THRESHOLD OF THE WORLD OF FORM We are now in a position to examine the correspondences between DAATH an d the Vector Equilibrium Matrix. We might also elaborate on the mystical state produc ed by use of the figure. One of the earliest Qabalistic documents, THE BOOK BAHIR , contains an intriguing passage, in this regard: It is I who have planted this 'tree,' that all the world may delight in it, and with it I have spanned the All and called it 'All'; for on it depends the All, and from it emanates the All, all things need it, and look upon it, and yearn for it, and from it all souls go fort h. I was alone when I made it, and no angel can raise himself over it and say: I was there be fore thee; for when I spanned my earth, when I planted and rooted this tree and caused them to take delight in each other and (myself) delighted in them--who could have been with me to whom I might have confided this secret? This tree of God, which is the tree of the world but at the same time the tre e of souls, is spoken of in other fragments of the Bahir. In some passages, however, it is not represented as something planted by God, but as the mythical structure of God's creative powers.(1) "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"When we recall the properties of the V.E.M. there is an interesting corre spondence with this \"mythical structure of God's creative powers.\" 12 vertices 8 triangular faces = 50 symmetrically positioned topological features 6 square faces 24 edges In this sense, the V.E.M. = 50. The Hebrew word for 'All', 'every' also = 50. This wor d is spelled Kaph-lamed (k-l). The numeration for V.E.M. itself might be V =6, E=5, M=40 = 51, the number of the Hebrew Jubilee, a very holy number. One can only speculate on the meaning of \"All + 1.\" As stated in the beginning of this treatise, Aleister Crowley declared : The theogeny of our Law is entirely scientific. Nuit is Matter, Hadit is M otion, in their full physical sense.(2) It may seem strange that Infinite Space is equated with matter. But eve n in the deep vacuum of space, there is still motion, matter and energy. Empty space is not empty, but suffused with fluctuating fields of energy. As this energy matter s it warps or bends space/time around it. Matter and its surrounding space are inseparable. Crowley gave the numerological attribution of Nuit as N=50, V=6 = 56. Curiously, we also find this number in the Isotropic Vector Matrix, I.V.M. = 56. In Synergetic s, there are 56 axes of cosmic symmetry, (533.22). [DAATH; Vector Equilibrium Matrix] [Figure : Isotropic Vector Matrix] There is further correlation with the Hindi form of Nuit, Shakti: Sh=300, A=1, K=20, T=400, I=10 = 731 The meaning may not be readily visible, without further corroborating. The Qabalists added the digits of numbers together, for example 731 is 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. This type of reduction gives further information on the implicate meaning in words . Now, we readily see that NV = 56 = 11; IVM = 56 = 11; Shakti = 731 = 11. The number for the spiritual form of matter expressed as feminine d eity is 56, which reduces to 11. Crowley calls '11', the \" Key to All the Mysteries. \" Gareth Knight has linked Daath with the Isis Mysteries. He says this my thology is the safest way to work the sphere Daath.

NEURAL FEEDBACK AND BRAINWAVE TRAINING \"Gentlemen, I have a confession to make - half of what we have taught you is in error; and furthermore we cannot tell you which half it is.\" --Sir William Osler (to a graduating medical class) A man named Caton first discovered electrical rhythms within the br ains of animals in 1875. It was over 50 years later when Hans Berger showed that man also had these rhythms. His original search was in the hopes of finding the physi cal link between man's mind and his body. It was this mind/body question which led him to dedicate his life to f inding this link. He became interested in the work of Caton and others and set up his own laboratory to further investigate the electrical activity of the brain."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"After 20 years of research, he was first able to record the brain rhythms of a hu man. He spent another 10 years convincing his colleagues that this rhythm came fr om the neurons of the brain, not from blood flow or connective tissue. His original st udies also showed that this rhythm changed with age, was vulnerable to sensory stimulation, and was affected by body chemistry. World War II broke out and Hans Berger never finished his original work: crack the code of brain rhythms and their link to \"psychic functions.\" Since that time, no one else has either. Later research centered around the more practi cal applications of the EEG to epilepsy, brain metabolism, brain functions and the levels of consciousness. 1. BASIC METABOLIC RATE (BMR): Brain metabolism is directly related to body metabolism. One facet of the h uman body that the EEG will monitor is that of brain metabolism. Such gross metabol ic dysfunction as liver and kidney failure are easily seen with the EEG. Epi lepsy is also seen as resulting in a metabolic dysfunction within the brain. Because of these and other important factors, the EEG was incorporated into the medical syste ms of Western society. The EEG is also a good reflection of how well oxygen is metabolized in the blood . Your body needs oxygen in order to convert food resources into energy. Any deviation in oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output changes the EEG reading. Both hyperventilation and hypoventilation cause the EEG pattern to slow do wn. The amount of sugar, as a food resource, also affects the EEG. 2. BRAIN ACTIVITY AND THE SOURCE OF ALPHA WAVES The EEG is considered to monitor \"gross\" neuronal activity. It does not moni tor individual neurons per se, but large groupings. Whenever rhythms are see n in the EEG, it is the net result of many thousands of neurons \"in unison.\" Because alpha is seen so easily in the EEG, it was originally thought that the re must be some kind of intracranial control mechanism (pacemaker) that cause d all of those neurons to fire in unison. Recently two Dutch scientists claimed to have proven the existence of su ch an alpha- pacemaker. It supposedly was located in the thalamus, located in the brain st em. It was thought to gate impulses from the body (spinal cord) into appropriate locat ions in the brain. Hand impulses are thus gated into that part of the brain design ated as hand. Alpha, then was thought to be a very rhythmic gating of the information from the body to the brain. This rhythmic gating results in alpha. It is thought to be the result of a ver y relaxed state. Non-rhythmic gating, resulting in dyssynchronous brain wave activit y, was considered a type of coping response to impinging stimuli. Since the pacem aker theory of alpha is still tentative, it has not yet received wide recognition w ithin the scientific community. This is a result of a very complex relationship bet ween"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"autonomic nervous system activity, brain metabolism, age, and a host of other pertinent factors. 3. LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS One of the most important facets of the EEG is that it is an excellent indi cator of levels and states of consciousness. Audio or visual inspection can determi ne whether a person is alert, relaxed, drowsy, asleep or even dreaming. Specific detail and arbitrary limit-points for various levels of consciousness are now defined by EEG parameters. The field of altered states of consciousness (ASC) and expl oration and control of consciousness are all a direct result of this very important tool . It is often through the introduction of these new tools that new techniq ues and discoveries are made. The tremendous advances in electronics made in t he past decade have advanced sophisticated equipment that stimulated psycho-ph ysics and research in new ideas in science. This is especially true in the area of biofeedback and self-control technology. 4. BIOFEEDBACK TRAINING The technique of biofeedback is based on the fundamental process of instrument learning. A situation gives rise to several variable behaviors. One response i s in some way rewarded or reinforced. Learning occurs as this response occurs successively more and more quickly and reliably. Essential to this learning process is the receiving of information in a fee dback loop, similarly to servo systems. This can be done via visual or auditory stimuli, which tell us when we have made the correct response or moved closer to our goal. This is made possible by using electronic feedback loops (such as those p rovided by an Electroencephalophone or EEP) and a psychological technique called operan t conditioning. The first successful attempts were attributed to Joe Kamiya in the late 1950's. Essentially, his technique gave a signal when he achieved specific l evels of consciousness. Its full potential has yet to be realized. Behavior has traditionally been divided into two categories: 1. Voluntary control, such as walking, writing, muscular activities; and, 2. Autonomic control, such as heartbeat, blood pressure, brain-wave production , visceral body processes. We learn to guide our behavior by receiving feedback on the results and then making appropriate adjustments. This is the place where the voluntary and involuntary behavior differ. While we can receive feedback in our writin g, we do not have such access to those from the visceral activities. If provided with this absent (bio)feedback via electronic means, it h as been shown conclusively that we can learn to exert a \"voluntary\" control of\\over inner bodily"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"functions. Yogis have done it for centuries, taking years to learn the discip lines of mind control, self-hypnosis, and autonomic regulation. Recent research into control of heartbeat, blood pressure, body temper ature, brainwave production, and pain control indicates that conscious control is possible. Research into control of brainwaves through the use of biofeedback techn iques has centered around alpha waves, and more recently, theta. Some of the more well- known researchers are Kamiya, Kasamatsu, Brown, Hart, Peper, Mulholland , Stoyva, Green, Walters and Green. In discussing biofeedback research and results, one runs into a probl em of semantics. It is the idea of learning to \"control\" one's brainwaves. It must be emphasized that in using these techniques, a person is not learning to di rectly control the neuronal electrical activity of action potentials and synaptic e vents in the cerbral cortex. One learns to control the subjective or mental event as sociated with the presence of alpha or theta. Like self-hypnosis it requires not-doing or letting it happen. Very t ypically people \"try\" to enter alpha; then they \"try not to try\"; finally, they simply learn how t o let go into the state. The experience may be different for each person each ti me depending on their frame of reference. Changes in brainwave patterns, or blood pressure, body temperature and dee p muscle tension are \"physiological correlates of psychological processes th at the subject learns to control.\" 5. BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS The pattern of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortical section of the b rain can be recorded electrically. This is done by measuring the electrical pote ntial difference between two points on the scalp. The record is known as the electroence phalogram (EEG). Brain waves manifest themselves as oscillating voltage. They have two mai n dimensions: the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude. The frequency predominantly determines the amplitude of the brain wave, but there can be fluctuations of amplitude at a given frequency. Brain waves are broken up into four main categories, determined by the frequency of the wave. The borde rs of these categories are more or less arbitrary. The following table is the refore only approximately correct: [Brainwave Table] Beta : This is the brainwave of normal waking consciousness. It is characterized as the state of being awake, alert, and concentrating. If thi s state is maintained for a prolonged period, it becomes associated with feelings of tension, worry, fear, or anxiety. Lower brain states are necessary on an occasional basis to maintain the alert aspect of this state. A visual- identification in the mind's eye occurs, a state where image are iden tified with form and specific objects."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Alpha : This is also a conscious state, but identified with the mental experience where images are not identified. It has come to be associate d with feelings of pleasure, pleasantness, tranquility, serenity and relaxation. I t can also imply a relaxed concentration. It is also a place of light sleep and dream states. Theta : This state is traditionally labeled unconscious by western medic ine. In recent years, however, people trained with autogenics can achieve this state and retain consciousness, similar to meditators. Theta has come t o be associated with such things as hypnogogic imagery, day dreaming, sleep, and creativity. It has also been shown as the state where healing and regenerating of tissue occurs. Delta : This state is predominantly associated with non-dreaming sleep or deep sleep. There are some reports of individuals achieving this set of brainwave patterns and still retaining consciousness. If it is achieved while maintaining a conscious state, \"out-of-body\" experiences (OOBE) are subjectively experienced and reported. 6. SLEEP CYCLE The EEG pattern changes throughout the night. These changes can determin e when dreaming occurs. The chart below is an average sleep cycle during those eigh t hours. [sleep cycle diagram] Stage 1 is the drowsy period of sleep, characterized by what is known as slee p spindles (spindle-alpha). Stage 2 is a sleep state where response to ext ernal and/or internal stimulation can occur. This stage is characterized by what is know n as K- complex waves. Stage 3 means you are on your way to Stage 4. Stage 4 is deep sleep. It is also delta state and is not associated with dreaming. REM state (Rapid E ye Movement) is where most dreams occur. Notice how an individual spends most of the first part of the night in State 4 sleep. The later part of the night is spent mostly in REM sleep. Therefore, most dreams occur toward the end of the night's sleep. When deprived of REM sleep, tem porarily personality changes occur with other psychological changes. When lost sleep i s made up, the person spends more the sleep cycle in lighter REM stages. In a sense, this makes up for that lost dream time. Although there is a lot of variable data on EEG changes with age, there is a basic curve that shows the usual rate of development and change with time. Prim arily the EEG frequency of a person starts very low, about 1-2 cps in a newborn infant, gradually increasing in frequency until the age of 19, where the normal adult rhythm, while awake, is about 20 cps. [frequency chart]"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Things which lower the EEG frequency are: sedative drugs, LSD, large doses of alcohol, very low blood sugar, lack of oxygen Things which raise the EEG frequency are: caffeine, small doses of alcohol, barbiturates, low blood sugar, excess of carbon dioxide Hypnosis, per se, has little effect on the EEG, unlike meditation whic h influences it directly. What is contained in the hypnotic suggestion will change frequ encies and make the difference, for example, suggestions for relaxation, increased w armth, and blood flow. 7. HOW THE EEP WORKS The EEP generates a feedback signal by picking up the very low voltage brain-w ave signals with two or more electrodes. A high-gain circuit amplifies th e signal and drives a wide band filter. This filter passes signals in the alpha thr ough delta range and attenuates signals of higher and lower frequencies. The feedback is usually in the form of a modulated white-noise with mod ulation at the brain wave frequency. There usually two controls, one for amplitude variati on and the other to discriminate frequency bands for tighter control. The cerebral cortex is the outermost part of the brain. It is this convolut ing mass of tissue that gives man superior intelligence. The cortex of each hemis phere is divided into four main areas, called lobes. Alpha is found predominantly on the occi pital lobe or back-part of the brain. This is the section which deals with visu al systems. Alpha is also found in the frontal lobe, but not as easily. Theta is found more commonly on the temporal lobe, while the speech, sensory, and motor areas ten d to show primarily beta activity. Electrode placement usually uses a ground or reference point under one e ar. The potential generated between the two electrodes is very important. There fore, the second electrode is usually placed in the occipital region, just under the inion (\"bump\" on the back of the head) and to one side about 1 inch. The side chosen is the same side that the \"ear\" electrode is on. This gives the optimal gradi ent for easily monitoring brain signals. 8. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Pleasure, relaxation, and sleep are associated with alpha-theta output. The combination of relaxing, clearing the mind and turning inward can be a ver y pleasant and rewarding experience. Learning to relax and to go from alpha to thet a has proved to be beneficial to the insomniac. In some cases, it can also be a slee p- substitute. Hypnosis subjects are much more susceptible to suggestion when i n lower alpha states. It is now possible to achieve states of consciousness within sever al weeks of training equivalent to those of Zen masters with 20 years meditation effort. T he main drawback is that when one learns these states, continual reinforce ment is necessary for similar continued ability, day-by-day. It is a use-it-or-lose- it situation. One of the main purposes for sleep is to transfer information and experien ces from short to long-term memory. Concentration, learning and recall ability can and i s greatly enhanced with alpha-theta control exercises. Recall capability is greatest in alpha state. Also, by learning to exclude all external stimuli when trying to achi eve the alpha-theta control, increases one's ability to concentrate. The reverie state which is indicated by theta and low-frequency alpha se ems to increase hypnagogic and dream-like images. There is also a link between reve rie and hypnagogic imagery and creativity. These images are critical for the creati ve process. Other biofeedback directions include: 1. EMG (Electromyograph) for hypertension, deep muscle contol, and readi ng improvement by eliminating \"subvocalization.\" 2. THERMAL FEEDBACK for controlling body temperature at various points on the body. Current research shows that most individuals can raise or lower finger temperatures about 8 F.; useful in the control of migraine and tension h eadaches. 3. GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) is used as a lie detector and supposedly is a way of communicating with certain plants. although the latter is highly quest ionable, there is a statistical significance in the change of skin resistance in cert ain fish 8 hours before major earthquakes, offering a possible early-warning system for hi gh-risk areas. These are just a few of many suggested possible applications. Biofeedback research should provide more new discoveries and ideas for years to come. The latest possibility is its incorporation with Virtual Reality to heighten the e xperience even more. V. CONCLUSIONS: THE QUINTESSENCE B. VIDEO FEEDBACK: SELF-REALIZATION THROUGH YOGATRONICS"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Abstract: A video feedback system is proposed, using a standard home computer and other immediately available hardware. Current research in the fields of brain chemistry and the brain's response to color, sound, an d geometry is reviewed.

A series of electronic meditations are developed to create b rain- body loops for interaction and self-realization, similar to those describ ed in eastern Yoga. Introduction: Biological feedback (bios-life, feedback-return to the source) expe rimentation has been found to be particularly well-suited to the Western mind. The con cept of time is muchmore important, everyone is in a hurry. Consequently, the western m ind looks for \"short-cuts\", using technology. Research and experience has shown it to be a rapid and promising means toward such goals as self-awareness, health, and s elf- exploration. Recent technological advances such as biofeedback instruments, have en abled man to realize the potentials of his inner power. These include mental concentration for problem solving, appetite control, preventive medicine, training to control heart- rate, blood pressure, and skin-temperature, anxiety, and others. Every day the re are new examples, where this concept of technology enters our life. The state of this art has become very sophisticated. The purpose of this paper is to show that, with currently existing tech nologies now standard in most homes, a technological transcendence is available, similar to ancient Eastern experiences of Kundalini. Health and expanded mental c apability would be by-products. Using interactive multi-media, the television c an now be used to change habits, personality, weight and other characteristics while broad ening our self-realization. The application of biofeedback research to the everyday lives of people has m any implications. These can range from mass brain washing to expanded conscious ness for all mankind. By integrating several fields of study, advanced technology now provides new tools for achieving altered states of consciousness. Populations can be re-programed and individuals can become self-enlight ened. An electronic meditation, using the most recently available information, is developed to create brain-body loops for interaction and control. The individual learns abou t the process of his own internal dialogue and can come to both sense, and later manipulate the loop of consciousness.

While we can receive feedback in our wri ting (for example), we do not have such access to those from the visceral activities. I f provided with this absent (bio) feedback via electronic means, it has be en shown conclusively that man can learn to exert a \"voluntary\" control over inner bodily functions. Recent research into control of heart beat, blood pressure, body temper ature, brainwave production, and pain seems to indicate that a conscious control is possible. In discussing biofeedback research and results, one runs i nto a problem of semantics. It is the idea of learning to \"control\" ones brainwaves. It must b e emphasized that in using these techniques, a person is not learning to di rectly control the neuronal electrical activity of action potentials and synaptic e vents (in the cerebral cortex). One learns to control the subjective or mental even t, associated with the presence of alpha or theta waves. Changes in brainwave patterns, or blood pressure, body temperature and dee p muscle tension are physiological correlates of psychological processes that the subject learns to control. Some of the more outstanding developments i n biofeedback research include the following examples: 1. Relaxation: Any degree of rapid, self-induced relaxation can be obtained by a number of biofeedback techniques. These include using one's musc le activity to operate the signals of an Electromyograph (EMG), even to the point of each individual muscle cell becoming relaxed. 2. Mental concentration for problem solving: The brain wave patterns which accompany effective and efficient mental activity are well-known. They ar e now used via Electroencephalograph (EEG). 3. Appetite control: When the compulsion to eat exists, the psychology and brain waves reflect this \"drive state\". The individual can train himself to r ecognize such a state by means of signals of his psychological activity which are displayed to h im. He can then train himself to distinguish and continue to reproduce a non-com pulsive state. 4. Preventive medicine: The physiologic activity of each troublesome sys tem can be used to \"feedback\" information about its own functioning. These incl ude heart rate,"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"blood pressure, respiration, skin temperature, gastric activity, intest inal motility, muscles and so on. 5. Training to control heart rate: In using feedback techniques there are two major areas; (1) a wide variety of cardiac irregularities, particularly tachycardia, bracycardia, extra systoles and auricular flutter, and (2) psychologic anxiety and fear reactions. 6. Training to control blood pressure: Can be life-saving when the patient has the ability to maintain his blood pressure low enough to prevent developing both th e symptoms of high blood pressure (headaches, dizziness) as well as preven ting the more serious results in high blood pressure. 7. Training to control skin temperature in specific areas: An easy physiologi c activity which individuals can learn to bring under control. Many disease proc esses involve constriction of the blood vessels in the hand (or foot or other areas). With feedback training, this vasoconstriction can be markedly reduced, with the consequence of relief from pain and coldness. 8. Anxiety: Numerous studies now indicate that a restful, relaxed but int erested subjective state is associated with alpha activity. Clinical emphasis is on assisting the subject to produce lower frequencies with higher amplitudes. 9. Education: Simple feedback systems are now used in conjunction wi th computer assisted teaching machines. It is well-known that the attention span of children is short. An accurate indicator of the length of each span of attention would be extremely useful in maximizing the use of teaching machines. 10. Drug use: A patient can increase the effectiveness of his drug tre atment. Since feedback techniques are applicable to all body systems, they decrease in testinal contractions, lower blood pressure, change skin temperature, etc. They also al leviate associated problems (muscle tension, anxiety, irregular heart beats, resp iratory distress, etc.). The patient can reduce undesirable side effects of the drugs he needs to take. 11. Lie Detector: Some newer modifications with Galvanic Skin Respons e (GSR) have been used to determine stress potentials. The surface of the body does contain information about internal state functions; it is just a question of isol ating variables. Combined with video imagery received from a television screen, feedbac k becomes a means for human beings to experience a focused centeredness, not unlike trance states produced by Tibetan monks and other adepts. Video Feedback: Video feedback is a continuously progressing feed-forward loop of light t raveling through a video recording and projection system. It usually interfaces a tele vision camera and a television screen or monitor. Through the manipulation of the television camera, it is possible to create, manipulate and define video i mages."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Biofeedback involves the externalization of internal states and processes . This permits easier manipulation of the process. Video feedback involves the interlocking of internal and external loops. In effect, there are electronic mandalas with great powers for focusing concentration, stimulating artistic appreciation and al tering conscious perception. Electronics creates video mantras through mantratronics, yogatronics and vide o light loops. Video systems detect patterns of energy at the camera, and then processes these patterns and projects them onto a screen. Video feedb ack loops the screen back to the camera. Patterns arise which can grow brighter (posi tive feedback), fainter or remain constant (negative feedback). The next stage is to add the human brain and other autonomic functions into t he light loop. As the brain might act as the \"camera,\" the signal sent to the proc essor could also be altered, in such a form as to \"more efficiently move the brain int o a previously determined state of awareness.\" Today, video feedback has been only used to permit eye-hand manipulation of the described interlocked loops. This then helps the individual to unde rstand and manipulate his own inner loops (eye-hand) more easily. But what if we we re to monitor brain waves? The signal could be \"processed\" and a computer could the n direct an \"altered\" signal to the screen monitor. This \"altered\" patt ern would be calculated to be \"most efficient\" feedback in assisting the brain achi eve the \"desired state\". We are not talking about those auditory and visual cues one uses to single out motor units and control their isolated construction. There are specific patt erns, colors and sounds which, in themselves, move the individual toward those pre-det ermined states. With this in mind, the system for feedback would include: a. Brain/body monitors/amplifier system. These signals then \"go\" to a ... b. Gating system, which sets threshold and level sense with timing parame ters. The brain/body information is now ready to go to ... c. Pattern recognition (associative, memory, array). The signals then go to a ... d. Probabilistic synthesis control system. This has the ability to be pre- programed for specific signal forms to the ... e. Video/audio feedback devices. These deliver the \"altered\" stimuli to complete the loop. The new evoked responses are registered, and the process begins anew. The key is the Probabilistic synthesis control system. It is here that t he feedback loop system can be altered for specific goals or direction of meditation. F or example, in Florida several grade school systems use a brain-video feedback system. The children watch their lessons on TV. When their attention begins to wande r, their individual brain patterns drop in frequency. At a certain (predeter mined)"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"frequency, the lesson is stopped (by a computer) and a new stimulus is given to the child (usually an action scene, i.e. Western). This \"snaps\" the consciou sness of the child back to \"attentive\" and the lesson is resumed. This simple form of video feedback in Education has improved reading and math skills 40-80% above norms. Imagine what advanced research in computer-graph ics might yield. Pattern Recognition: A primary function of the brain is in the recognition of patterns. This is the ability to perceive general inter-relationships between different par ts of an input signal. These signals are usually visual, acoustical or tactile. It can also do this for ide as and concepts. The perception of such unexpected relationships lies at the very hea rt of humor and creativity. The difficult part of pattern recognition is to see past the l ocal variations, into the pattern lying beneath. This is not a signal-to-noise ratio problem b ecause the patterns beneath are not necessarily the same. Recognition does not seem to be simply a matter of recall from a vast memory, because we can distinguish patterns (like speech) without ever havi ng heard them previously. Techniques like filtering, adaption, correlation, recollect ion, etc. are used today. The understanding of recognition is largely a matter of understan ding how to deploy these various activities. Equally important with pattern recognition is pattern synthesis. Thes e are the techniques of generating the complex electric nerve signals which give rise to speech and coordinated muscle movement. The ability to speak or write reveals a genu ine creative ability. In some sense, pattern synthesis is the converse of patt ern recognition. The synthesis process must play an important role in the us e of context in recognition. Memory and it's function completes the primary functions of the brain . There are three basic types of memory: 1. Short-term is responsible for the events of the last few seconds. It is very accurate. It involves the storage of the signal long enough to bring context to bear on the recognition process. 2. Long-term is used to recall knowledge we have acquired, events experien ced and ideas from previous thoughts. It is associative in character and stores can not b e addressed except by association. This means that some quality of the signal processing mechanism makes some signals more suitable for memorizin g than others. 3. Similarity function store contains the signal processing algorithms. The se are the acquired habits of thought. Once stored, they are very difficult to erase b ut very easy to ignore."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"It is in the short-term and long-term memories that we remember \" facts\" and explicit techniques, while it is in the function-store that we eit her learn or know how to think. Other functions of the brain would include signal processi ng, learning and adaption. I will discuss these in a later section. At the heart of the problem of pattern recognition is the concept of simil arity. Since no two patterns are identical, the act of pattern recognition is the act of pe rceiving a degree of similarity between an observed pattern and that in memory. This e nables us to then classify the new one. It is therefore critical to apprehend di fferent kinds of similarity, and a very important part of pattern recognition involves selecting t he appropriate similarity function. Pattern recognition nearly always involves some form of iterative process befor e a firm decision is made. It is either necessary to solve simultaneous equat ions, or to form a hypothesis of what the pattern must be (usually with highly inad equate data). If the latter, then it must be tested, until it becomes mor e or less recognizable. The importance of context in the process of pattern recognition is clear. Th e kind of similarity to look for in correlating two signals depends on context. A pattern is really nothing more than a feature in the context of other features. This dec oding of signals by the use of contextual information is a vital part of all aspects of patte rn recognition. A Model for Pattern Recognition: The repeated pattern of iterative feedback loops reflects a further re peated pattern and demonstrates how signals are processed by the brain. As modeled, a pattern is nothing more than the inter-relationships of the subpatterns compr ising it, and these subpatterns are the inter-relationships of various features. C onversely, features are only recognizable in terms of their contexts (the patterns they comprise), and patterns are only recognizable in terms of their environme nt. It is therefore expected that all aspects of pattern recognition are perf ormed in the same system. The model proposed has three main iterative loops of which th e signal analyzer, the similarity function and the addressing of the associative st ores are optimum. Patterns in general differ not so much by some quantitive measu re as by some qualitative dissimilarity, or quality of the pattern. Figure 1 shows a complete block diagram for pattern recognition with a small home-type computer: (insert figure) Figure 1: Block diagram for pattern recognition feedback loops. This type of system was first proposed by Hill (1) in 1969 for a speech recogniti on machine:"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"1. The analyzer contains transducers and circuits which transform the s ignal into sequences of features. 2. The associative store should contain templates of feature sequences as w ell as templates of deep structure and class. The function is to bring contextu al information to bear upon the recognition process. Correlation eliminates or reduces errors, and plays a major role in synthesis. 3. The comparator is where the input feature sequences are organized in to a form in which they can search the associative store for similar storage. 4. The similarity function store contains the algorithms specifying the var ious types of similarity and classes of patterns it can handle. If you wish the machine to learn, it is into this store that the new algorithms would be written, represe nting new points of view. 5. The generalizer is a higher level pattern recognizer in that it identi fies similarities between classes. Via the store selector it directs the search throu gh the associative store to those parts of it which are most likely to contain the patterns sough t. Every computer whose operation and structure is completely known will consist of two independent systems, the hardware and the software. The hardware cont ains the memory, input, and output devices, and perform the actual work. The sof tware provides the instructions for what to compute, which alone determin es the meaning of the computation. For example, one could monitor the state of every computing element at all times and, in the case of a binary language, portray this by a table of zeros and ones as a function of time. However, without the knowledge of the software, such a t abulation provides no clue to the meaning of what is being computed. The software alon e determines the intelligence content of the computer output. The Software: New research has demonstrated the capability of showing clear relation ships between specific brain output patterns of a given artist and specifi c types of expressive, artistic activity. In addition, it has recently become possi ble to isolate aspects of the brain's evoked response to sensory stimuli, physical and imagi ned. Clynes (2), a medical doctor who worked at the Research Center in Rockman St ate Hospital in Orangeburg, New York, has shown that characteristic and hi ghly repeatable response shapes or waveforms can be recorded from motor acti vity during the overt expression of a specific emotion or idea or during physical articulation of rhythmic pulses in music from a particular composer. Recent and current research is showing that the brain's evoked respons e to a sensory stimulus can be broken down and analyzed in such a way as to relate specific peaks in the evoked response waveform to specific aspects of ei ther the"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"stimulus itself or the processing behavior of the participant. The evoked response is primarily dependent on two factors: 1. The physical parameters of the stimulus, or 2. The significance or meaning of the stimulus that is dependent on subje ctive experience. E. Roy John (3), a pioneer in the understanding of the brain states: \"When an experienced organism receives a novel and meaningless stimulus and generalization occurs, this new afferent input in a familiar context activ ates the representational system in such a way as to cause release of a common mode of acti vity like that stored during the learning experience.\" and \"Analogous data from experiments with human beings indicate that phase- locked potentials are released at the time that absent stimuli are expected to occur. Furthermore, the waveshapes released when particular visual stimuli are imagined resemble the waveshapes of potentials evoked by actual presentation of the imagin ed stimuli.\" Clynes took a number of volunteers and shaved their heads, placing a series of electrodes in rosette patterns on various regions of the head. These inclu ded the temporal, frontal lobe section and occipital regions of the brain. In this way, n ot only were brain frequencies monitored, but directional shifts in th ese frequencies could also be determined by the geometry of the electrode configuration on th e skull. The original purpose of Clynes' work was to find how precision and order e xist in brain processes; to discover what is inherently programmed in man and ho w he might make use of that inherent program. These individuals were given a number of images (form) and colors to conce ntrate on while their brain was monitored by computers. Recording from opposite pairs of electrodes simultaneously, he obtained views of the electrical activit y from different angles: mathematically, a spatial differentiation of the electrode vecto r. What he was mapping was consciousness (literal). He literally mapped fields in the human brain. A computer was able to id entify and reproduce those geometrical figures which that human was concentratin g on, either as a geometric form, or color of some object. The individual did not even have to look at the pattern, but simply concentrate \"in his mind's eye\". A standin g wave means that the wave is not changed, but is holding itself steady in one cert ain geometrical thought. A number of very important observations were made:"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"1. Certain qualities and relationships were of greater importance to the c omputer than such quantitative factors such as intensity. This meant that the brai n's system of identification is based on differences, rather than intensity of th e signal. 2. Thin lines were found to produce characteristic evoked potentials, ir respective of size. The form itself is transduced into another form in the brain \"spac e-time\" which can be measured. There is a one-to-one correspondence between visual forms of the stimulus, the response forms in the brain, and the perception. This is, perhaps, the first physical description of the field of an archetype. It is a geometrical structuring and has uniqueness. 3. The process of inhibition is as important for transducing the external w orld as is excitation. Concentration on specific lines of geometry does not constitu te the changing stimulus, but their steady presence systematically and radic ally alters the response to another changing stimulus. 4. Changes in intensity of a single color produce very simple response shape . Light and darkness (as opposites) show no evidence of being different values of th e same variable. Rather, they seem to be the result of stimulating and also of inhibi ting different receptors. Thus, the evoked potentials to light and darkness i n no way may be said to be positive and negative, respectively. White, for example, appears in t his view as the result of mutual inhibition of color. 5. These experiments clearly imply an inherent form of organization and not a random learning of nerve nets. It is possible to mentally recognize and per ceive the stimulus within the first portion of the evoked potential. Responses (in the brain) which occur later than 0.3 seconds are seen as systematic processes, or tu ned circuits to those responses to specific in-coming stimuli. This i s a form of resonance in the brain. They act like keys to \"unlock\" specific parts of our brain, oft en being observed below psychological threshold levels (subliminal). Geometry and Archetypes: It is now evident that every stimulus for corresponds to a particular space- time\" shape in the brain (in terms of electrical activity). A computer can even identify these shapes, much like \"looking into someone's mind and seeing their p ictures\". These \"space-time\" shapes are evidence of relationships between the external world and its representation in the brain. We have chosen to call these spatio-temporal representations \"keys\". The se \"keys\" seem to operate on \"locks\" in our brain in a manner similar to \"minting\" of DN A production and replication. An archetype may then be seen as a specific ge ometrical system of standing waves occurring in the brain as a \"space-time\" shape or \"key\". In living organisms, opposites receive their structuring of symmetry fro m particular combinations of spatial and temporal aspects. Like the reins on a horse, each of the opposites of the physiological pair has its own place. While they do balance mot ion, in themselves they do not cancel each other. This geometric aspect make s them"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"capable of being opposites. The activity of each arm determines the quantit y of the turn; the spatial identity of the rein determines the quality. There is no monotonic (or linear) transition from one to the other, passing through some form of \"zer o\". Information is embodied in a field, rather than just being a field. The ge ometrical images are basically an abstract quantity of information; a field relationship between one point and another in the universe. Unlike most engineerin g channels of communication, biological channels are dynamically asymmetric. Information on change is transmitted across space asymmetrically with respect to the direction of the change of the variable. This means that if a biological system is to be informed symmetrically abou t dynamic changes, it requires two channels. The basic reason for this dynami c asymmetry is that biological channels for control use the concentration of mole cules to transmit information at some point along the channel. This must involve an asymmetry since the creation and transportation of molecules is generally accomplished by different means from their breakdown and removal. Concentration can be made a function of information as long as the change requi res an increase in concentration. Decreasing concentration generally cannot be accomplished as fast through the same channel. The level of hormones whic h have issued into the bloodstream cannot be decreased through the action of t he same gland. A decrease in concentration is produced by metabolic processes or through the increase in level of a counteracting hormone or chemical. In either cas e, the decrease in concentration is produced through quite different chan nels from the one producing an increase in concentration. The significance of this asymmetry of uni-directional rate sensitivit y in the \"space- time\" patterns in the brain is that if it were not for this principle , interaction and cancellation of opposites would prevent the formation of unique \"space-t ime\" patterns for each perception. In this case, memory could become impossi ble (as defined). An event is registered as a pattern in space as well as a pattern in time. Wit h the sense of touch, for example, removal does not cancel the sensation, even when t he touch was short and momentary. A distinction can be thus made between quali ty and quantity. Quality is given by the channel location, quantity by the firing pat tern in the channel. In living organisms, opposites receive their structure of symmetry from a p articular combination of spatial and temporal aspects. It is the geometric propert ies which makes them capable of being opposites. This \"rein control\" implies dis tinction between quality and quantity. With each rein, messages are similar and not oppos ite in character. The activity of each \"rein\" determines the quantity, the s pacial identity of the \"rein\" determines the quality. Any view of the universe is an interplay between information and energy. By information, it is meant as those processes which provide recognition and"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"identification of separate existences. By energy, it is meant those tran sformation and displacement of the contents of space. This interplay between informat ion and energy involves identity, quality and recognition. The Vector Equilibrium Matrix: The use of geometry and geometrical forms as video tools offers intriguing possibilities. They allow experiential interaction with archetypes or god-forms. They also grant access to those specific altered states where one experienc es the eternal aspect of sacred time: A consciousness of immortality. A geometrical image is developed in the book THE DIAMOND BODY: A Moder n Alchemical View of the Philosopher's Stone (4). This image comes from t he field of solid state physics, corresponding to both the Jewish mystical traditions an d current concepts in imaginal psychology. A mathematical model is generated to assist th e development of anima consciousness via a visualization exercise, called The Diamond Body Exercise, (DBE). A series of biological resonances occur between specific internal-st ate functions and the \"outside\". These resonance relationships are discussed and spe cific models are given to aid visualization and resonance. This practice of meditation develops a common ground, uniting psyche with matter. Through the stabilization and equilibrium fostered in the individual during meditation sessions , the individual is brought into increased harmony with the environment. More important, a \"r epair function\" is now available, one able to reverse those entropic functions related to libido. The DBE is a breakthrough in meditation techniques. Steeped in myste ry, the Merkabah Chariot of Sephir-Yetzirah, Ezekiel's vision and \"the Cube of Space\" are all the samething. It is a regeneration meditation for immortality. And, it is now available to the common household.... It is the contention of this book that the most fundamental (pre)geometr ic form is the Vector Equilibrium Matrix (VEM). The vector equilibrium constr uct, first proposed by Buckminster Fuller (5), describes the most economical l ines of movement within the atomic nucleus. This geometry form leads directly t o the Diamond Body of Cube of Space. To place oneself inside this structure, or to project this matrix form outward as a visualization, creates and generates a resonance within the \"space-time\" shapes of the brain. The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is a geometrical mandala reson ating with the psychological analog for the Philosopher's Stone! The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is a visual tool which connects macrosc opic structures to quantum modes. It graphically depicts the sphere, wh ose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. It can be used as an acces s tool for realizing multiple quantum ordering."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"To begin to understand this form of order, a new tool for perception is neede d. The new concepts of order involve the discrimination of the relative differe nces in \"space-time\" (and similarities). Attention should now be given to sim ilar differences and different similarities (6). Such a format in mathematics is calle d a ratio, or matrix field. \"The universe is a cosmic computer on the pre-geometric level of information in which space and time appear as secondary statistical construct s .\" (7) The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is such a matrix field; although seen as a geometry at any stage, it is pre-geometric in that it describes the change from one stage to the next. It is a quantized state of information. A video projection of this Diamond Body structure is now possible, with r otation of axis and \"rising on the planes\" (from spherical coordinates). The resul ting geometries create specific \"space-time\" patterns in the brain. Th e resulting patterns allow \"access\" to those specific archetypes (associated with specifi c \"space-time\" patterns). They are known as \"Star Gates\" or \"planetary gates\" in mystical literature. Real-Time Color Graphics: Most problems in complex structure and function require visualizat ion. And, as the size of the structure increases (like \"rising on the planes\"), a thir d dimension is needed to give visualization perspective (context). Real-time color graphics systems have unique advantages for display of information. Studies of the structures and interactions of large biologic al molecules require both coordinate data and three-dimensional visualization. Softwar e has been developed that now allows real-time display of color line and surface d isplays (8). Now that we have hardware and software for selective display of complex objects in color and stereo with real-time rotation, depth cueing, and int eraction, a program is now underway to insert the Vector Equilibrium Matrix into thi s program for use in a video feedback system. This real-time color graphics system would respond to logic circuitry i n the similarity function store. The feedback from the video section would get u p an iteration loop, going from the \"space-time\" patterns in the brain to the t elevision. A rotation or depth cueing (\"rising on the planes\") would create a similar (and very specific) corresponding change in the \"space-time\" pattern. Most important, this could be done as a pre-programmed response, direct ing our brain to specifically desired \"experiences\" or archetypal encounter s. Considerations In Design: A general purpose bio-medical preamplifier should form the front en d of any comprehensive system. Accurate frequency discriminations (2-20 Hz) and the feedback system should be capable of responding to peaks or zero crossing of i n- band signal oscillations. It must be able to change in signal amplitude."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"This means that a good variable threshold detector and envelope follower shoul d be included in the over-all system. The input section should be capable of either AC or DC coupling, depending on specific applications and providing a choice of f ixed gain of about 10(3) or variable gain of about 10(5). Other measures such as time spent producing the desired signal are useful but more expensive. They are als o less likely to be needed. The major sources of error are those due to biological sources, electrodes, am plifier, interaction between the amplifier and sources, filtering techniqu es, and detection circuitry. For example, as EEG signals are among the smallest recordab le through gross methods, they are the most plagued by \"leakage\" from muscle potential s (EKG signals). Thus, it is necessary to use differential amplifying techniques in order to obtain accurate results, subtracting background signals, commonly a problem be tween closely placed electrodes. Other factors presenting problems are the high impedance of biological sources, typical 100K ohms or higher on the skin. The body is also a rather good radio/TV antenna, picking us unpredictable DC noise. Complete designs for comprehensive biological monitoring/feedback uni ts are described by Rosenboom (9). He and a number of other artists built these u nits to drive electronic synthesizers and color organs in the early 1970's. They were essentially creating \"alpha-concerts\". A number of shows were perform ed and the specific logic and hardware is outlined. There is even a design for an Evoke d Response Peak Detector design by R. Koehler in this volume. Summary: The purpose of this paper is to show that, with existing technologies in hardware/software, it is now possible to use the home computer/tel evision as a very powerful tool, where health and expanded mental capabilities are only by-prod ucts. A new dimension in learning and self-realization is available for the hom e. Biofeedback research has advanced the fields of medicine and health. It is now possible to control and direct specific autonomic functions previousl y either not available or semi- control over a ten year yoga program. Video feedback systems are now successfully used in learning/education programs. New models on pattern recognition and the nature of information nets allow for simple models which could be used with home computers (large memory). The research of Clynes and Hill shows a clear relationship between s pecific brain output patterns and specific geometry. A first state for describing th e physical analogs to unique archetypes is developed. Specific geometrical images wil l invoke specificbrain responses. A formula emerges. The Vector Equilibrium Matrix is a visual tool which con nects (or describes) the change from one state to another. It is the method in which a specific \"space-time\" pattern changes into another with uniquenes s. This matrix has"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"already been set into a grid of values and qualities, based on Jewish mystical traditions and current concepts in imaginal psychology. A mathematical model is generated to assist the development of anima consciousness via a visualization exercise called The Diamond Body Exercis e. A video projection of this Diamond Body structure is now possible, in the hom e. The resulting effects lead to the possibility of pre-programmed respons e, directing our brain to specifically desired \"experiences\" or archetypal encounter s. Previous designs for biofeedback systems using audio and visual are descr ibed. The immediate applications of this in the home are staggering. Populations can b e re- programed and individuals can become self-enlightened. Electronic m editation creates brain-body loops for interaction and control. This state of control is a f orm of technological transcendence. On the mundane level, this proposed syste m could be used to loose weight, stop smoking and change other deep habits. Conclusions: There is obviously a very immediate need for research. The implications of th is range from mass brain washing to expanded consciousness for all of mankind. Approximately 95% of the households in the United States have at least one television set. Home computers will be similar with another ten. The design problems for this type of system are minimal. Hardware now exist s in a variety of markets and is competitive. The installation is also simple, pl ugging RF inputs to the antenna leads of any TV system. All bio-monitoring equipmen t is similarly fashioned to the body, with some form of isolation (optical). They prob ably will be available within five years through such game systems as Odyssey or Atari. The next advance will be a brain switch, via neuro-electronic correlate s. Already there is known to be another \"sensory motor\" in-put in the microwave regi on (0.3- 3.0 GHz) (10). A feature called Contingent Negative Variation (CNC) has been isolated as a facet of the EEG through computer fourier analysis and somehow corresponds to will. The two are related somehow but not known. CNV relates to the cessation of neutral scanning when an object or even t is recognized. An individual could learn to trigger the appearance of the CNV eve n without the presence of any object. It is conceivable that this \"switch \" could trigger an implanted brain-terminal to some central computer. Data transmissi on might be via direct brain communication in this microwave region. The other side of this technological advance is that unscrupulous adverti ser who might attempt to sell his products via sub-liminal geometrical/color p atterns in his advertisements. Since most of us do not have conscious awareness of this ne w sense, it obviously is submerged into the unconsciousness. If this is true , and it does in fact appear so, then one country could conceivably broadcast specific microwave patterns toward their neighbor to somehow affect the social or group consciou sness."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"It appears as if, with all other \"breakthroughs\", it is a double-edged blade . The future could contain such changes with this type of system, that the \"sc hool\" concept is changed, and classes are in the home. While only 10% of the cereb ral cortex is used now, a major jump in use and access will occur with the advent of this concept in learning. It is quite conceivable that the future will also allow for new concept s in our relationship to \"time\" and \"space\".

ABSTRACT: Nuclear engineer and researcher, Thomas E. Bearden has proposed a new approach to physics with some startling new theories base d on Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (1973). Bearden extends QM theory, rather than corrupting it. The main thrust of Bearden's work is toward explaining paranormal phenomena, the collective unconscious, weaponry, and other technological possibilities. His new view of physics (energy science) is grounded in what he calls scalar electromagnetics, from which he proposes deriving \"free energy.\" This is, in essence, tapping the Vector Equilibrium Matrix for zero p oint energy. The key to his technological approach is to \" let the EM force fields fight themselves to a 'cancellation,' forming a vector zero. \" Antigravity is just one possibility. Multiple realities contain all possibilities, but in enfolded or virt ual states. This theory alleges that there are clustered worlds, which are three- dimensional to an observer within them, yet virtual to an observer from outside. These hyperspace dimensions are orthogonally rotated (90 degrees) in respect to one another. Selecting a frame, or cube of space, facilitates access. When we consider the vastness of space, we perceive emptiness due to our relative position in this universe. The Void is actually densely packed with virtual energy which awaits translation, or transduction into our observable 3-dimensional reality. These energies or entities appear as virtual becau se they are unobservable through ordinary means. Crosstalk across these"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"channels is the basis for the collective unconscious, paranormal phenom ena, and the manifestation of our material world. Like philosophy, physics is not any absolute description of Truth. Rather, both disciplines invite us to \" Look at it this way .\" This approach is very much in line with the long-standing tradition of speculative Qabala and Herm etic philosophy.

This implies the extension of consciousness to include all other consciousness."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"--Aleister Crowley, THE BOOK OF THE LAW Thomas Bearden's theories bear directly on our investigation of the nature of N uit and the vector equilibrium matrix. By commenting on the physical and philosophical qualitie s of the vacuum, and attempting to describe how nothing becomes something, Bearden has joined a host of philosophers, mystics, and scientists with an interest in the threshold of our observable universe, and what lies beyond. In EXCALIBER BRIEFING: EXPLAINING PARANORMAL PHENOMENA (1988), Bearden succinctly outlines his theory, as well as offering several rea l-time applications. In order to relate his ideas and those of Everett to our notions of the V.E.M., we shall have to draw heavily on his work. We ask the reader's patience with the necessary quotes, but we hope they will si mplify the complexity of comprehending even the gross nature of the V.E.M. But before w e review Bearden's ideas, we will discuss what state-of-the-art quantum cosmology has to say about the nature of reality. Long ago the Gnostics believed that the true unrevealed nature of the Void was a Ple num, or fullness. Modern quantum mechanics has physically verified this intuitive perc eption of reality. The vacuum of empty space is not empty. It contains energy (zero point energy) and entities (pure virtual particles). Both the energy field and empt y space are in flux, and probably interface with other universes through wormholes (or tunnels). Sidney Coleman, a theoretical physicist from Harvard, has been investigating the nature of the vacuum and its relationship to the cosmological constant--zero. He, and other physicists can't decide whether the total energy in the vacuum should be positive or negative, but they agree that the energy ought to be huge. Coleman asserts \" the cosmological constant is zeroed out by wormholes; invisible, submicroscopic rips in the fabric of space-time that tunnel out of our universe, linking it to an infinite web of other universes.\" The rational of the cosmological constant derives from the uncertainty princ iple, which applies to variables like energy and time: What it says in this case is that the precision with which you can measure the energy of any system, such as a piece of empty space, is limited by the duration of the measurement; the shorter the time, the greater the imprecision. And this indeterminacy can never be resolved simply by more accurate measuring instruments; it is inherent in the system itself. Over a short enough time the system can assume just about any energy--and it does. In a world ruled by quantum mechanics, the energy of the system in any fleeting instant can be seen only as a wavelike function. As a consequence, the vacuum of empty space is not empty; it is pervaded by fluctuating fields of energy that, when large enough, manifest themselve as particles--individual photons, for example, or particle pairs consisting of an ordinary electron or quark and its anti-matter twin, which burst into existence"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"and then annihilate. The vacuum is thick with these short-lived \"virtual\" particles. It looks empty only because each particle's visit to existence, according to the uncertainty principle, is so infinitesimally brief as to be undetectable. But the effects of these virtual particles en masse may be detectable. Virtual particles ought to have one effect in particular: their energy ought to warp space. The deformation would be entirely independent of that wrought by ordinary matter, and so, Einstein notwithstanding, it would constitute a nonzero cosmological constant. How big would the constant be? That depends on how often virtual particles appear in a given volume of space, and it also depends on the type of particles. Virtual quarks and electrons have much the same effect as their \"real\" counterparts: they cause space to contract. But virtual photons, or any other force-transmitting particles, have the opposite effect: they cause space to expand. There are a whole bunch of things that contribute to the cosmological constant. Some are plus, some are minus, so we expect some of them to cancel. But not the whole lot... The cosmological constant is very nearly zero. The mechanism, according to Cole man, is similar to virtual particles in that it arises from quantum fluctuations. But thi s time the fluctuations aren't those of energy fields [zero point energy]; they are fluctuations of empty space itself [vector equilibrium fluctuations]. Stephen Hawking invented the quantum wormhole in 1988. Just as quantum mechanics says there is a certain probability that particles can appear from now here in a vacuum, quantum cosmology says there may be a certain probability that a small chunk of spac e and time will suddenly pop into existence. That is what a wormhole is--a fluctuation i n the space-time field, just as a virtual particle is a fluctuation in an energy field. The wormhole could connect to any one of an endless number of preexisting parallel universes that are otherwise inaccessible to us. There is no reason to assume our unive rse is the only one; webs of parallel universes are equally possible. They can be im agined like balloons connected to one another by thin, rubbery necks of space-time--those are the wormholes. The regions inside and outside the balloons and wormholes are outside space-time. It doesn't exist. One meaningful consequence of wormholes is that they might contribute informati on to our universe in the form of values for the constants of nature. They might also fix the energy density of the vacuum--the cosmological constant. Somehow wormholes arrange things so that the value of the cosmological constant is zero--so that the huge virtual particle components cancel exactly. According to quantum cosmology, this is by f ar the most likely outcome. Zero point energy is the kinetic energy that remains in a substance when its te mperature is absolute zero. The vacuum has zero point energy, also. Any potential is just a bunch of trapped dynamic vectors, hence trapped vector (translational) energy. It is t ranslational"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"energy that is locally trapped and not translating. The potential is thus like an accumulator or capacitor. It can be \"charged up\" and \"discharged.\" The vacuum is increasingly being regarded as composed of an incredibly dense st ructure of virtual electromagnetic energy, even at zero degrees absolute. Superspace consists of pure massless charge flux, pure scalar waves. If compacted this energy density of the vacuum is enormous. Here, in the vacuum, spacetime is incredibly dense, and matter is etherically thin. Spacetime goes through matter, rather than matter through spacetime. And thi s energy density of the vacuum does interact with electromagnetic fields and matter to give observable effects, such as the Lamb shift. In his inflationary model of the hot Big Bang, Alan H. Guth considers matter to consist of scalar-field particles, (SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, Dec. 1991). \" Such field particles are not the stuff of everyday life, but they do arise naturally in many theories.\" Indeed, they are believed to be the dominant form of matter under the extremely high energy conditions similar to those in the early universe. According to the inflationary model, they lead to a kind of negative pressure. Gravity effectively becomes a repulsive force, and inflation occurs. At the end of the inflationary era, the decay of the scalar-field matter producing the expansion heated the (initially cold) universe to a very high temperature. Although the scalar field is largely homogeneous, it still may have small, inhomogeneous parts. According to quantum theory, these inhomogeneous parts cannot be exactly zero but must be subject to small quantum fluctuations. (In fact, all types of matter are subject to such quantum effects, but for most purposes the fluctuations are so small as to be totally insignificant.) The rapid expansion of the universe during inflation magnified these initially insignificant microscopic fluctuations, transforming them into macroscopic changes in density [ref. chaos theory and the pumping up of micro- to macro- scopic changes as one of the characteristics of chaos]. Inflation itself depends on a number of assumptions. For example, it would have occurred only if the scalar field began with a large, approximately constant energy density. This approximately constant energy density is equivalent, at least for a brief time, to Einstein's famous (or infamous) cosmological constant. Therefore, like it or not, the success of inflation rests on certain assumptions about initial conditions [ another aspect of chaos theory ]. What happened before inflation? How did the universe actually begin?\" In the pre-inflation era, the size of the universe tends to zero, and the strength of the gravitational field and the energy density of matter tend to infinity. That is, the universe appears to have emerged from a singularity, a region of infinite curvature and energy density at which the known laws of physics break down."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Near a singularity, space-time becomes highly curved; its volume shrinks to very small dimensions. Under such circumstances, one must appeal to the theory of the very small--that is, to quantum theory. In quantum mechanics, motion is not deterministic, but probabilistic. A quantity called the wave function encodes the probabilistic information about such variables as position, momentum and energy. For a single-point particle, one can regard the wave function as an oscillating field spread throughout physical space. Because of the uncertainty principle, the kinetic and potential energy of a system cannot both be exactly zero. Instead the system has a ground state in which the energy is as low as it can be. (Recall that in the inflationary universe, galaxies form from \"ground-state fluctuations.\") Such fluctuations also prevent the orbiting electron from crashing into the nucleus. The electrons have an orbit of minimum energy from which they cannot fall into the nucleus without violating the uncertainty principle. Though it is still considered an extravagant claim, the fundamental asser tion of quantum cosmology is that quantum mechanics applies to the entire univers e at all times and to everything in it. In a theory of the universe, of which the obse rver is a part, there should be no fundamental division between observer and observe d. The wave function of the entire universe can't collapse each time an observati on is made. In cosmology, there is only one system, which is measured only once. Hugh Everett III of Princeton (1930-1982) asserted that there exists a universa l wave function describing both macroscopic observers and microscopic systems, with no fundamental division between them. A measurement is just an interaction between different parts of the entire universe, and the wave function should predict what one par t of the system \"sees\" when it observes another. So, there is no collapse of the wave function, only a smooth evolution described by the Schrodinger wave equation for the entire system. But as he modeled the measurement process, Everett made a truly remarkable discovery: the measurement appears to cause the universe to \"split\" into sufficiently many copies of itself to take into account all possible outcomes of the measurement. This has been discounted by others into possible histories for the universe with assigned probabilities. For practical purposes, it does not matter if we think of all or just one them as actually happening. Certain regions, such as those close to classical singularities, exist in w hich no prediction is possible. There the notions of space and time quite simply do not exist. There is just a \"quantum fuzz,\" still describable by known laws of quantum physics but not by classic al laws. [It may be subject to the laws of quantum chaos]. Inflation is assumed as one of the quantum initial conditions. The inescapable task of the quantum cosmologist is to propose laws of initial or boundary conditions for the universe. Stephen Hawking's idea is called the no-boundary proposal, which admits many possible histories. Perhaps, the universe has tunneled from \"nothing .\" The evolution described by inflation and the big bang would have subsequently occurred"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"after tunneling. This is consistent with the Qabalistic explanation of the emana tion of Kether from Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur--the veils of negative existence. The picture that emerges is of a universe with nonzero size and finite (rather t han infinite) energy density appearing from a quantum fuzz. After quantum creation, the wave function assigns probabilities to different evolutionary paths, one of which includes t he inflation postulated by Guth. Although some theorists disagree, both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals seem to predict the conditions necessary for inflation, thereby, eliminating the need f or assumptions about the scalar-field matter that drove the rapid expansion. The no- boundary and tunneling proposals eliminate assumptions about the density perturbations. Although inflation explains their origin, the exact form and magnitude depend on certai n assumptions about the initial state of the scalar-field matter. The inflation model assumes the inhomogenous parts started out in their quantum mechanical ground state--the lowest possible energy state consistent with the uncertainty principle. But Hawking's no-boundary proposal states that everything must be smooth and regular on the bottom cap of the space-time tube. The condition implies that inhomogeneous fluctuations must be zero there. The fluctuations enter real-time a s small as they can be--as the quantum mechanical ground-state fluctuations demanded by the inflation model. The tunneling proposal makes the same prediction, for similar reas ons. So, quantum cosmology alleges the universe appeared from a quantum fuzz, tunneling into existence and thereafter evolving classically. Quantum creation scena rios produce gravitational waves of a calculable form and magnitude. Gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter as they propagate through space-time. Therefore, when we observe them in the present universe, their spectrum may still contain the signatur e of quantum creation. But gravity waves are hard to detect, so quantum cosmology can't be verified conclusively to determine whether the no-boundary or tunneling proposals are the correct ones for the wave function of the universe. But, so far, these are the best guesses, and they do not contradict the Qabalistic notion. ENERGY SCIENCE AND SCALAR FIELDS How does Bearden's energy science relate to quantum cosmology, the vacuum, and vector equilibrium? Through scalars and scalar fields, the virtual vacuum plasma (\"virtual particle vacuum ether\"). A scalar is a vector characterized by magnit ude and time. Scalar waves (virtual particle flux wave) in the virtual state massless charge flux (vacuum), do not breach the quantum level to become observable, yet they are real. They are oscillations of the stress energy tensor of the vacuum. In the vacuum state everything is disintegrated, but highly dynamic. The vac uum is not an emptiness FILLED with massless charge, rather, it IS identically m assless charge (disintegrated dynamicism). It is a plenum, not an emptiness. It is also pure, undifferentiated action."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Multiple vectors acting on one point and summing or multiplying to zero (Vector Equilibrium Matrix) are physically still present, even though their vector r esultant is a zero vector...Thus physically a zero vector can be a system having a very re al, distinct sub-structure of nonzero vector components. These infolded vector components may be highly dynamic (i.e. chaotic). The anenergy of each infolded dynamic vector component is thus \"trapped\" inside the local vector zero system. Anenergy is the stress energy of the vacuum. \"Fragments\" of energy, more subtle than electromagnetic energy, turned against themselves are locked into a vector zero summation. This is modeled as scalar, massless charge flux or virtual partic le flux, or \"pieces\" of the spatiotemporal vacuum spacetime medium. These observable virtual anenergy particles are rotated more than 90 degr ees from the laboratory space. Anenergy particles are the individual scalar wave compone nts of vector electromagnetic waves. Anenergy components may be coupled into energy, whic h can be compacted into mass. Scalar fields exist for each point in space (Hadit) which infolds n-d imensional virtual state substructures. Each succeedingly higher dimension is a succeedingly lower level of a virtual state. THE VACUUM ITSELF IS SUCH A SCALAR FIELD. This massless charge field enfolds vast electrostatic scalar p otential. Standing scalar waves can be coupled at exactly 180 degrees out of phase in a resonant cavity to create zero sums through scalar resonance. There is just such a res onant cavity in the brain, between the pituitary and pineal glands. These waves of potential co - modulate each other and \"lock or zip together\" as a zero-vector system wave. This allows for crosstalk or translation between dimensions. Dimensions have cert ain primary geometrical physical attributes, such as length, used to describe the separational relationships of physical phenomena. By geometrical we mean that the dimensi on is considered to \"exist\" in either the presence or absence of the observable physic al phenomenon. However, by agreement the dimension of itself is not directly observable. Yet it can be inferred by measurement. Hyperchannels for crosstalk between dimensions are known as \"magic windows \". These interdimensional nodal points have a naturally tuned frequency of a good hyperchannel between orthogonal frames where scalar wave anenergies crosstalk rea dily. Crosstalk normally means the transfer of energy or signal from one channel to another, by cross modulation or cross coupling between the channels. In this new approach it refers to the virtual energy exchange between orthogonal universes or frames- -that is, between different 3- or 4-dimensional slices of an infinite-dimensional universe . Magic windows are frequency dependent. Some magic windows are 38-40 kHz, 150- 160 kHz, 1.1-1.3 MHz, 1.057 (Lamb shift), and in the near ultraviolet frequency. These frequencies represent enhanced channels between subqu antal (virtual) and spatial (observable) states. A particularly good magic window exists when the infrared and ultraviolet bands being utilized are phase-locked so that the ultraviolet represents a first harmonic of the infrared."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Also known as the Tesla wave, this standing scalar wave can be seen alternately as a time wave or a gravitational wave. It is a wave of pure potential. It is a longitudinal scalar potential wave in massless charge, in the vacuum charge flux itself , and in pure spacetime. Since there are no spinning charged mass particles, it does not form a vector electromagnetic wave, as conventional theory would predict. It break s into shadowy, virtual vectors which are not integrated. Rigorously vector fields cannot exist in a vacuum, but can only exist on an observable mass. A \"shadow\" vector field can exist in a vacuum. In the absence of observable m ass, it exists as small virtual vectors, each existing as a virtual particl e in the vacuum. Such a \"shadow\" vector field may be regarded as two coupled scalar fields, where the coupling is performed by the virtual particle flux of which the vacuum itself consists. If this same holds true for the collective unconscious, it may be a physical an alog for the unintegratable aspects of the archetypes in human personality. Reson ating standing scalar waves in the brain may be the physical interface for archet ypes. Since the vectors of vector equilibrium represent the paths of least resistance, they may represent preferred pathways in the brain, as suggested by the chroni c reappearance of archetypal patterns. Classical brainwaves are only the residue or \"spillage\" waves of the brai n. The important activity is in the specific patterning of the vector zero summations of the myr iads of ion discharges. Every \"discharge ion\" constitutes a small EM force vector . The summation of these vectors is largely zeroed; however, the patterns for med by all these tiny components are not random. The intent and will of the h uman being is expressed in the changes in the patterning of these dynamic substruct ures. Present EM brain wave theory does not touch the basic \"thought patterns,\" which are scalar in nature. Consciousness refers, among other things, to the intersecting stream of monocular, one- at-a-time virtual projections into the mind from the quantum changes of photon interactions upon the body sensors [to be explained more fully later]. Memory gives the entity the illusion of moving through time. In the absence of deep er understanding, the individual consciously sees itself as a separated physical obj ect moving and changing in time with respect to other separated objects that it perc eives. The \"externality\" of certain changes in the physical world is due to the lack of mental control or influence over them. \"Internality\" of certain other changes is due to the ability to mentally control or influence them. The ordinary conscious mind is a serial processor. Only one thing at a time is discriminated in its awareness. But the unconscious mind is totally conscious-- but multiply so, since it is a parallel processor of many discriminations at onc e. The linear mind cannot directly perceive the individual discriminations of the para llel processor, since THESE APPEAR ONLY AS A BLUR OR NOTHINGNESS to it. T his is the mechanism of the barrier between the conscious and unconscious minds."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Projections from the unconscious onto the scenes of the conscious mind will thus appear symbolical--that is, having many hidden meanings at once. This is why our dreams , for example, appear to our conscious minds as weird and distorted, but highly symbolic in nature. The mind is a world composed of separation events (waves, operations, processes) in unseparated being. We may model it as a physical universe, three orthogonal turns away from the ordinary physical universe, and tuned slightly selectively to one physic al organism's body processes. Eastern masters have always told us that all reality is mind-stuff. Now w e can model that process. Mind anenergy is considered to be progressively collected, condensed, and kindled into denser substance and objects by rotation toward the ordinary physical worl d. Thus a piece of inert matter is simply condensed energy, which itself is condens ed anenergy, which is condensed mind flux (crosstalk) from all minds [collective unconscious]. We may model the mind physically, or model the physical as mindstuff, elimi nating the artificial dichotomy between mind and matter that presently is assumed in ort hodox science. The VEM and Diamond Body are psychotronic generators for amplifying and transla ting mindstuff. They are devices for producing observable effects by collecting, c ondensing, amplifying, and/or processing subtle anenergies or scalar waves. Psychot ronic devices are virtual state engineering devices that process and utilize scalar EM w aves of massless charge flux. LIGHT AND TIME A photon is the basic action quantum. It may be considered as an oscillation in and outof time. It may also be considered as a virtual pattern of positron/electron pair s. It is a piece of electromagnetic radiation when it interacts as a particle. One half of the photon exists in and carries positive time (negative charge), and the ot her half exists in and carries negative time (positive charge). Thus, one half is \" normal\" and the other half is \"time-reversed\" (phase conjugated). The photon may be considered as one cycle of an electromagnetic wave. The photon is the basic carrier of time. It consists of a piece of energy welded to a piec e of time, with no seam in the middle. The passage of \"time\" thus moves at the speed of light, its carr ier. When its magnitude diminishes below the quantum threshold, a photon becomes a virtual photon, whose emission and absorption cause charge on an electron. Photon interaction is the absorption and emission of photons by particles or objects. The macroscopic world is created by this interaction, which is the basic quantum cha nge interaction. Scalar waves are emitted and absorbed by the nuclei of atoms, passing right t hrough the electron shells without interaction. When we introduce additional scalar interac tions"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"beyond the ambient background, the nuclei change appreciably, though this level of physical reality may be far from stable. This is the higher reality, and it is sensed by the scalar electromagnetic functioning of our nervous system. Unfortunately, this system outputs only to the deep unconscious, since it is highly multiocular. Thus our conscious mind, being monocular, does not perceive the most fundamental reality in which we exist. \"Time\" is the special dimension in which multiple objects can exist simultaneous ly in the same interval. Time is multiocular and space is monocular. Our conscious mind is fi tted to the monocular photon interaction. Being monocular, our conscious mind cannot be aware of time directly. For that reason we do not \"see\" time consciously. We do \"see\" it, however, unconsciously. The true meaning of being \"lost\" is to be separated from the consciousness of t he All, which is separation of our conscious, gross sensing from our finer, more subtle, and infinitely richer--and unconscious--scalar sensing of ultimate realit y. Because the effect of photon emission is \"carrying away time,\" it forms a filter between our se nses and fundamental reality. This time-differentiation of fundamental reality, eliminates our ability to detect those things which occupy time but not normal 3-dimensional space--such as mind, thought, etc. Almost all our thoughts, concepts, words, and ideas are fitted to this partial real ity-- and this is the universal human problem and delusion. Einstein alleged that our language demands Cartesian coordinates, and thus limits our thinking. We see a spatial universe of separated spatial objects, while in actuality w e exist in an undifferentiated single wholeness. The mindworld and the physical world (mind and matter) have in common the same time dimension. Dynamic movements in each result in small crosstalk being projected into the other world, a crosstalk so small as to be virtual and normally unmeasurable. The photon interaction invokes a time-differentiating operation, stripping away or suppressing the time dimension, resulting in a spatial reality or objective r eality being perceived or observed. In the process it separates mind and body by destroying the only common connection or channel. The photon interaction is the agent that creates objectivity itself. The photon inter action separates spacetime into space and time exclusively. An object, being somethi ng which occupies space, is thus timeless. Objects do not exist in time, because the union of an object with time constitutes spacetime, which cannot be perceived, detected, or observed. Only changes in (derivations of) spacetime can be perceived, detected, or observed, but not spacetim e itself. That with which light has not interacted is not objective. The concept of mass is not a function of time, but only a function of space. It is thus three-dimensional. The photon is also three-dimensional, but one of its dimensions is the"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"time dimension. When the photon strikes the mass and is absorbed, one portion is turned into mass by orthorotating one turn. Its compound nucleus of spacetime is not perceivable. When a photon is re-emitted, it may or may not be of the same frequency and energy as the previously absorbed photon, depending on the absence or presence of any other perturbations. A small bit of spatia l mass is orthorotated which turns the bit of mass into a small piece of energy. In the rotation a small piece of time is bitten off and yields a quantum of action, which now constitutes a photon. Photon emission thus strips away the time dimension, leaving a spatial object. EINSTEIN POINTED OUT THAT THE VELOCITY OF AN OBJECT MAY BE VISUALIZED AS ROTATION OF AN OBJECT IN HIGHER DIMENSIONAL SPACE. VISUALIZED AS SPATIAL ROTATION RATHER THAN ROTATION TOWARD THE TIME AXIS, THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT IN A VACUUM MERELY CONSTITUTES THE ROTATION OF A PIECE OF MASS BY AN ANGLE OF 90 DEGREES TO THE LINE OF MOTION, IN THE LAB SPACE IN WHICH WE VISUALIZE THE PHOTON (THE ROTATED PIECE OF MASS) AS MOVING. The spacetime compound nucleus has now once again been separated into spatial and time components. Time is moving with the photon. And that is why time moves or flows at c, the speed of light in a vacuum. Time is carried only by the photon and photon interaction with an object produces that object's march through time. We perceive stability within change because we cannot detect, perceive, or obse rve the compound nucleus of spacetime in the middle. Thus we experience change as a thing becoming something else, but still being the same thing. VIRTUAL REALITY CHECK: VIRTUAL (STATE): that part of physical reality consisting of changes (particles, waves, and other entities) smaller than the least detectable (quantum) change. Disintegrated changes. A thought or thoughtform is also virtual. May be visualized as consisting of real, dynamic \"pieces of vacuum\" or \"pieces of nothing\"... Every ordinary observable particle (photon, neutron, electron, proton, etc.) contains or consists of a dynamically changing cloud of virtual objects. Exchange of virtual objects is thought to generate almost all forces of nature...The mind may be considered a special virtual universe, and thought a virtual object. Virtual states consist of multiply nested levels, each level progressively finer and more subtle. These sublevels also correspond mathematically to higher geometrical dimensions. --Thomas Bearden, EXCALIBUR BRIEFING"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"THE BODY ELECTRIC Our understanding of the processes which go on below the quantum level adds another nuance to our metaphysical concepts of the \"subtle body\", the relationship of mind and matter, and the relative nature of reality. Whatever we find out about the nature of t his realm, and its relationship to mass, applies to our own bodies and minds as well. We are one and the same as the structures that underlie the matter and energy of our gross structure. That structure is continuous, interconnected, and non-local in nature. We have, enfolded within our being, an underlying reality even more fundamental than the structure behind the interconnected wave patterns described by quantum mechanics . This massless counterpoint to our being has its basis in non-being. To conceive of its nature, we must penetrate not only into the Void, but beyond--through the looking glass into a dimension where chaos is the norm. Whatever this world is, we are that! You share the same anatomy as the Star Goddess. The elements of your body were cooked in the crucible of some long-exploded supernova. This very ephemeral virtual ether translates itself into matter by turn ing and turning on its gyres, transforming itself from no-thing into something. We per ceive its real-time effect as electricity, without really comprehending w hat that energy is. \"It is well known that all mass is charged; thus everything in one sense is electricity. To examine this concept, let us look again at the electron with its virtual photons being emitted and absorbed, which virtual activity creates the electric field of the electron.\" According to Bearden, the electric field constitutes a steady activity of the emission and absorption of virtual photons. The electron spin is more of an implosion or explosion in higher dimensional space. Spin is occurring in at least four spatial dimensions, not jus t three. It is more of an implosion or explosion into and out of this three-space universe frame. We might visualize the implosive or explosive spin as similar to vector fl ux. Two like-charged particles with precisely antiparallel spin run right through e ach other when they meet, with no interaction at all, electrical or otherwise. This succe ssful experiment at Argonne National Laboratory disproved the old idea of concrete, solid, material reality. Yet, once again, we are that! In the middle of being is non-be ing. Before we leave the descriptions of the sub-quantal electrical activity of the body, we can examine some of the implications of bioelectromagnetism. The most prominent researcher in this area is Robert O. Becker. Becker is famous for his research on applying electrical fields to the body f or healing and tissue regeneration. But he has also done experiments relating the applicatio n of electromagnetic currents to the brain and results on consciousness. Some of the most interesting are recounted in THE BODY ELECTRIC, co-authored with Gary Selden (1985)."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"We also found we could work backward, using the [DC] currents to produce anesthesia. A strong enough magnetic field oriented at RIGHT ANGLES [orthogonal] to a current magnetically \"clamped\" it, stopping the flow. By placing frogs and salamanders between the poles of an electromagnet so that the back-to-front current in their heads was perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force, we could anesthetize the animals just as well as we could with chemicals, and EEG recordings of magnetic and chemical anesthesia were identical. We got the same effect by passing a current through the brain from front to back, canceling out the normal current of waking consciousness, as in electrosleep. Becker's further comments bear on the mind/body interface, and give a phys iological mechanism for hypnosis. It tangibly demonstrates \"mind over matter.\" He r ecounts his physical findings from hypnotized subjects. In each case, I found that the frontal negative potential of the head became less negative, often reaching ZERO, as the client attained deep trance. The reading changed in the same direction as in anesthesia, only not as far. Then, when the suggestion for pain control was given, the arm potential reversed just as it had in response to procaine. Conversely, when a control subject was asked in normal waking consciousness to concentrate forcefully on one arm, its sensitivity to pain increased, and the hand potential became more negative. We found we could use this difference to determine whether a person was really hypnotized or just cooperating. Some doubters (including myself, I'm afraid) had believed hypnoanalgesia was merely a state in which the patient still felt the pain but didn't respond to it, but these experiments proved it was a real blockage of pain perception. It seems that the brain can shut off pain by altering the direct-current potentials in the rest of the body \"AT WILL.\" There's every reason to suppose that pain control through biofeedback or yoga likewise works by using an innate circuit for attenuating the pain signal, which releases a shot of the body's own pain-killers. When the signal is appropriately modulated, it releases endorphins (internally produced opiates)...I predict that research on this system will eventually let us learn to control pain, healing, and growth with our minds alone, substantially reducing the need for physicians. ...We know, on the psychological level, that a person's emotions affect the efficiency of healing and the level of pain, and there's every reason to believe that emotions, on the physiological level, have their effect by modulating the current that directly cantrols pain and healing. EM FIELDS, ACTION, CREATION, and TIME Every physical change of a charged particle (from proton to neutron to electron) constitutes a modulation imposed upon its virtual photonic activity creating its electromagnetic field. These modulations collect, become coherent, and brea ch the threshold of the virtual dimension.

The EM field plays an integral role in coupling the virtual state reality to observable state reality. Action, according to physics, is the fundamental constituent of physical reality . In metaphysics, action is the agent of karma, producing natural consequences. Acti on is non-observable; only changes in action are observed, and then only partially. The photon is the basic quantum of action, uniting energy and time. All physical things are composed of rates of changes in action. These action changes are totally internal to the mass itself. Therefore, literally, the physica l universe exists inside each and every part of itself, and is a giant hologram. An ordinary photon has a certain size that is quite fixed, and it is made of the substance \"action\" which is totally nonperceivable and nonobservable. Only changes in acti on are perceivable, observable, or detectable, never fundamental action itself. So physics already prescribes a universe made out of action, and that universe has no length, no time, no energy, no space, no concrete existence. Yet from it can be taken--b y differentiation (which is simply separation)--any length, any time, any energy. However, only a single quantum at a time changes or is separated. Quanta do not superpose. At its most fundamental level, the entire universe is continually being create d and then destroyed in sequence. The continual creation of a tiny piece of time and then the destruction of the piece of time makes us experience reality or change as if we were a pointer moving along a time line. We cannot see time because it is continually being destroyed by the change proce ss, the very process of physical detection or observation itself. This is similar to t he annihilation of a photon when it hits the retina and becomes absorbed. Now, if we invoke another kind of change, a virtual change, such that its size is al ways smaller than the actual quantum's size, then this kind of change cannot be detected, e ven theoretically. The concept of a virtual change is one such that the quantity of acti on that was changed was deliberately made smaller than the size required to throw the switch of detectable or observable change. It is an infinitesimally small pertur bation. Individually, virtual photons cannot breach the threshold of quantum change, and so cannot be observed or detected. But in concert, they do breach the threshold. The totally unobservable, undetectable virtual photons being emitted and absorbed are conceived as creating the electric field at the same time as observable physica l change (ordinary quantum change) occurs. The electric field, of course, can cause or induce change of sufficient magnitude t o breach the quantum threshold and result in observable change. The bottom line is this: the virtual state can be collated and collected to sufficient magnitude to breach the quantum threshold and induce ordinary observable physical change. The electromagnetic field already does precisely this!"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"We can coherently collect the virtual state to produce matter or its anti-mat ter, which after all are nothing but macroscopic assemblages of quantum changes, and w e can thus get free energy, materialization and dematerialization, teleportation, and a ntigravity by means of special modifications and development of electromagnetic circuits. Each photon carries a small piece of time. And the entire virtual state realit y is hanging onto that small piece of time as a modulation. That is where the probabilities are r iding, in terms of the ordinary monocular interpretation of quantum mechanics. All the probabilities and possibilities are concretely real and occupy orthogonal univer ses. Since they all share the same single time dimension, there is a TIME BRIDGE OR TIME CHANNEL [QM wormholes] connecting the universes. Each move or change in one of them crosstalks a tiny bit into each of the others. Since it is the photon which carries them, then each photon contains all possibilities and virtual states modulated upon itself. Photon interaction thus involves the communication of these possibilities and virtual states to the object with which the interaction occurs. The virtual state psychotronic modulations of the mass's electric field are now riding on the virtual photons that generate that field. Every possibility concretely exists in that manner, in the virtual state, tim ewise hanging into the time dimension of the detected physical world's four-space frame, but s pacewise hanging out of the ordinary three-space physical universe of objects. So indeed all possible realities, even the wildest and the most farfetched exist in the virt ual state. THE TIME CHANNEL IS QUITE LITERALLY THE PARANORMAL CHANN EL THAT CONNECTS THE NORMAL SPATIAL WORLD TO AN INFINITY OF NO N- NORMAL SPATIAL WORLDFRAMES. Only by the continual destruction of each piece of created time (by fusing it back together with the piece of energy i nvolved, and forming a quantum which is unperceivable) are we able to experience physical rea lity at all, uncluttered and relatively free from the vast hordes of infinite realiti es through which the ship of quantum-change physical reality sails. Since the electromagnetic field represents a collection of this vast arr ay of realities, then by proper selection (i.e., by coherent tuning) of multiple stages we should be able to select a particular virtual reality channel. And indeed so we can. Any schem e for drastically increasing signal-to-noise ratios should be adaptable to such a coll ection mechanism for the detection of bioenergy.

From tangible atoms we move by one level of abstraction to invisible fields and particles. A second level of abstraction takes us from field and particles to the symmetry-groups by which fields and particles are r elated. The introduction of superstring theory has stretched scientific minds even further . Superstring theory takes us beyond symmetry-groups to two further levels of abstractions. The third level of abstraction is the interpretations of symmetry -groups in terms of states in ten-dimensional space-time (sound Qabalistic?). The fourt h level is the world of the superstring by whose dynamical behavior the states are defined. We are inviting you also into those rarified events beyond the observable limits of nature, at the core of the core, as far within as we dare speculate. Scalar phenomena, while not directly visible, can be inferred. The discernin g will find that their own nature is truly reflected there, and its name is Mystery. So, come...into the Mystic. The following is paraphrased, quoted, or synopsized from EXCALIBUR BRIEFING: EXPLAINING PARANORMAL PHENOMENA (1988, Strawberry Hill Press) by Thomas E. Bearden, who is a retired Lt. Colonel (U.S. Army). It has been condensed and juggled to accentuate its relationship to Buckmins ter Fuller's description of the Vector Equilibrium Matrix, a zero vector system. We hope to use this new approach to quantum physics to further reveal the psychotronic properties of the Diamond Body and the Synergetic Qabala. We also hope to relate it to Theoretical Qabala and consciousness studies."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"To simplify this theory for the reader we have eliminated the equations .

Box 1649, Greenville, Texas 75401. THOMAS BEARDEN'S SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS Let us use as a definition of reality: reality is that which can be conceptually and mathematically modeled and fitted to the phenomena existing in one or more minds. Physical reality is that which can be modeled and fitted to the phenomena in one mind. Mental and physical realities comprise \"normal\" reality. Complex or \"paranormal\" reality is that which can be conceptually and math-matically modeled and fitted to phenomena which exist in more than one mind, but not in all minds. From pure nothing--empty vacuum, absence of thing--one can generate everything, the presence of thing. Here is direct proof that ultimately opposites are identical. [There is] identity of opposites on their common boundary. Thomas E. Beardon, Nuclear Engineer The conventional interpretation of relativity considers only a single observe r at a time (monocular). Change as seen by multiple simultaneous observers (multiocular) lea ds to an infinite dimensional, multiworld or multiuniverse similar to that postulated by H ugh Everett (1973). In the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics essentially all possi bilities exist and are. Each world splits into multiple possibilities after each and every event. Though consistent with the entire experimental basis of quantum physics today, this is a r eality where all possibilities are physically real in their own dimension, though virt ual entities to an observer in another dimension. Physical reality is not absolute. This can be shown experimentally. Two colli ding protons pass right through each other in total violation of all physical rules, if their spins are exactly parallel. [In vector equilibrium, waves pass through waves without inter ference]. Protons are the central building blocks of all matter, the fundamental constituents of everything solid and concrete. Yet, they go right through one another, without any eff ect whatsoever when their spins are aligned properly, simply cancelling physi cal reality. There is no independent existence to mental phenomena; there is a perception operati on involved when we think. There is no independent existence to physical phenomena; there is a perception operation involved when we observe physical phenomena. Furthermore, it takes a finite piece of time for the perception process to occur. At the boundary of exact opposites, all that is necessary to identify opposites is to l ose all perceptual distinction between them. And that is accomplished by multiocular perception--perceiving the presence of both at once unseparated, hence the absenc e of either exclusively present."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"NOTHING SIMPLY CONSISTS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE TOTALITY OF ALL OPPOSITES. It is a contemporary form of the alchemical union of the opposites, or the psychological notion of \"holding the tension of the opposite s.\" But, separate time intervals are required for finite monocular perception s. The laws of logic are simply the laws of the operation of perception--nothing more, nothing less. The ordinary laws of logic apply only away from a boundary. The boundary, threshold, or liminal area invokes the law of paradox. Identifying opposites simply consists of \"packing together\" two previously separated perceptions into a single third unseparated perception. Every single perceive d thing has a boundary, where it both begins and ends its exclusive presence in perception output. In any perception ordinary logic and paradox are applied. Ordinary logic is explic it and paradox implicit, or conversely ordinary logic is implicit and paradox explicit. NEW DEFINITION OF ZERO To a monocular perception process, multiple presence constitutes absence of the exclusive presence of any particular one. Therefore such a multiple presen ce is monocularly unperceivable, and hence becomes a zero to a monocular detection process. This allows new definitions of zero, and a solution to the problem of nothing. Consider that a monocular detection process asks the question, \"Is there a single exclusive thing present in my input?\" If the answer is yes, an output is generate d and perception occurs. If the answer is no, no output is generated and perception does not occur. The answer \"no\" occurs in two fashions: either total absence, or presence of two or more simultaneously. For either of these cases, monocular perception gives no output, and perception does not occur, i.e., the absence of perception occurs. Now note that the monocular perception cannot tell any difference in the two input conditions. To it, there is no distinction between the two conditions. The lack of any difference at all constitutes identity. Thus to a monocular perception process , condition one is identical to condition two when they are infolded together in condition three. So, TOTAL ABSENCE AND MULTIPLE, UNSEPARATED PRESENCE ARE IDENTICAL INSOFAR AS A MONOCULAR DETECTION PROCESS IS CONCERNED. Einstein's postulates of special relativity conclude that \" every photon is moving at the same speed relative to every particle \" in the laboratory frame of reference. The laboratory frame is the static reference frame of the observer/meas urement. But higher dimensions (unobservable) may be enfolded in hyperspace and orthogonally rotated (90 degrees) to the laboratory frame. The Cube of Space, Diamond Body, and Vector Equilibrium Matrix are such hyperdimensional frames of reference. They allow us to conceptualize and engi neer such realms. A frame of reference is a spatial, organized, measured lattice pla ced in emptiness (space, spacetime). Normally this refers to a 3-dimensional, spatial fra me."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"All objects and points in the \"universe\" or spatial frame are considered to simultane ously coexist at separate, measured points in the frame. It differs from the vacuum i n that, rigorously, vacuum has no existing definite lengths (vectors) and no existing de finite time intervals (scalars). These appear only after measurements/detecti on, and are relative to the observer and to the detection process. A separate reference frame may be assumed to exist for any fixed or moving obj ect, or entered on any point in another frame. When a type of frame is assumed, the entire clas s of physical interactions that can occur has been restricted to an assumed set or t ype. In other words, given the frame, the physics have been assumed. One of the greates t restrictions of an assumed \"frame\" is to rule out the consideration (existence) of other higher dimensions. In the new theory, higher dimensions are permitted and an orthogonally rotated frame can be equated to a field and vice versa. Hyperdimension, hyperspace, hyperframe, hyperworld, and hyperfield are al l synonymous terms. ANY KIND OF FIELD CAN BE TURNED INTO ANY OTHER KIND OF FIELD, MERELY BY CORRECT AND PRECISE TIME SYNCHRONIZATION. Mass is determined by the resistance an object poses to an accelerating or di sturbing force. Mass is also tied to three-dimensional objects. A photon, moving at the speed of light, can neither be speeded up nor slowed down; hence in one sense it exhibits infinite mass, but it loses a dimension when it intersects the laboratory frame. Due to orthogonality it appears two-dimensional with zero mass. This is because at the boundary opposites are identified. At the orthogonal boundary of three-space, zero mass and infinite mass become identical, so the photon exhibits both zero mass and infinite mass simultaneously when it crosses the threshold of the ma ss exhibiting world. The Diamond Body and VEM are manifolds of enfolded in-form-ation. The relationship between mind and matter is not mutually exclusive. The VEM is a means of engineer ing the transition from virtual to physical space, from concept to reality. Mind and matter are either partially or totally one and the same thing. They ar e of exactly the same nature, but only partially intersecting. Mind is an entire physical wo rld, but it only minutely intersects this physical frame, and then only in a portion of this phys ical plane. The single dimension parameter generates the second, third, fourth, fifth, and up to Nth dimensions of the manifold, by repetitive operations on itself. PRIMITIVE PERCEPTION The primitive observer or \"natural man\" is conditioned to perceive objects and rel ations between objects. This is the basis of logic, mathematics, and physics. Set theory is simply the synthesized and abstracted game of elementary perception of the macros copic world. This is why mathematics can be used to perceive physical phenomena."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"This macroscopic, intuitive perception is the basis of our concept of objectivity, and of our physical concepts of \"observed\" and \"observable.\" What we see as an object ha s interacted with photons of light through absorption and emission. Light itself is only detectable in its interaction with matter. The concept s of object, mass, three-dimensions, and observation are directly correlated to the photon-mass intera ction, and ultimately to the photon-electron interaction occurring in the human retina. The ideas of boundary, surface, and change in primitive perception thus involve two contradictory and simultaneously mixed interactions, absorption and emission. Beca use they are constantly intermingled, primitive perception cannot separate the t wo. Thus the primitive concept of a boundary consists of a simultaneous duality. Here the object bot h begins and ends. Here opposites are identified. The dimensionality and orthogonality (spatially) of the primitive perception proc ess are also interesting. Photon absorption constitutes spatial integration for the photon: one additional dimension is gained by the two-dimensional light wave turning itself int o the three-dimensional mass state. The photon also adds its piece of time to the absorbing mass, converting the mass parti cle to mass time or space time--adding the fourth dimension. Photon emission constitute s spatial differentiation, dimensionally speaking. One spatial dimension is lost b y a little hunk of three-dimensional mass turning itself into a two-dimensional wave. Going from outside the object toward the inside (to track with photon absorption), the boundary marks the end of the two-dimensional wave region, so the object (or, more precisely, the interaction region) is spatially two-dimensional on the outsi de, and spatially three-dimensional on the inside. [So is the Vector Equilibrium Matrix and the Tre e of Life]. It also occupies the time dimension on the inside, but not on the outside. [Ditto]. This directly accounts for a difference in the spacetime inside and spaceti me outside, and is why mass may be regarded as a curvature or change in spacetime. Going from inside the object toward the outside, the boundary marks the end of the spatially three-dimensional region and the beginning of the spatially two-di mensional region. So the object is now spatially three-dimensional on the inside, spatially tw o- dimensional on the outside. The inside now does not occupy the time dimension, while the photon emitted outside does. So on the boundary, one spatial dimension is gained going in, and one spatial dimension is lost going out. Time is gained going in and lost going out, by the mass absorber-emitter. Gain or loss of a dimension is accomplished only by orthogonal rotation between 90 degree nested spatial frames. The photon interaction may be modeled as orthorotati on of an entity spatially in a five-space. Einstein showed that velocity can be re garded simply as the measure of rotation of an entity in a higher dimensional space. Sincelig ht is orthogonal to the entire space, the speed of light is the same to every observer in tha t space. Velocity also represents a statement of the switching of time into lengt h, and length into time. It is therefore a rotation of the spatial three-dimensional frame."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"The photon interaction process is monocular. Each photon must attack matter individually, and live or die in the process. Each photon born from matter is also born independently. Thus the primitive observation process is monocular, since it is totall y in one-to-one correspondence with photon interaction that is monocular. Thus the observed world is monocular, quantized, discreteized. This why quantum mechanics seems so irrational and counterintuitive. It is difficult to comprehend t hat which cannot be verified by our senses and experience. But, macroscopic (observable ) causality may be violated by control of hidden subquantal (virtual state) variabl es. Everett's theory of the universal wave function incorporates multiple simulta neous observation, and hence direct insight beyond the limitations of the monocular correspondence to the photon interaction. Photon interaction must be excluded whenever the so-called quantum effect is exhibi ted. If photon interaction is invoked, classical reality emerges. Photon interaction cre ates classical objectivity. Photon interaction is a time-differentiating oper ator imposed on four-space. Since light carries time, photon emission from an entity strips away the time dimension converting it to a spatial object. The time portion of an entity can interact w ith any number of time portions of other four-law entities if the time aspects of al l of them coincide. To the laboratory observer, orthorotation constitutes pure dimensional integration and dimensional differentiation, and constitutes or creates an object in the first pla ce as three- dimensional reality. OUTSIDE THIS PRIMITIVE PROCESS ALL EXISTS IN THE OMEGA NOTHINGNESS VOID, WITHOUT FRAME OR FORM. Ultimate reali ty (specifically, action) is dimensionless in the objective sense: for the object ive sense exists only after an operation has been imposed. A quantum itself is lengthless (and has no exclusive energy, time, or momentum) until differentiation is imposed upon it. Fission and fusion of action quanta involve orthogonal rotation between orthogonal three-spaces sharing the same fourth dimension ( time) in common. When a quantum is observed as manifest it exhibits changes in length, time, energy, mass, and momentum. It can be modeled as a vector. A vector is a mathematical entity which can be characterized by a magni tude and direction. They are formed by a difference in potential between two spati al points. Thus inductance and capacitance are merely (electromagnetic) vector statements of amounts of rotation, one in a positive direction and the other in a negative direct ion, toward an orthogonal axis in higher dimensional space. Vectors are characteristic of particle motion, and do not observably exist in the absence of a particle. IN THE VACUUM, ONLY AN UNZIPPED (DISINTEGRATED) VECTOR PATTERN EXISTS, ONLY THE POTENTIAL FOR A FORCE VECTOR EXISTS THERE. The vector field is the assigning of a magnitude and direction (vector) to eac h point in space. [Reference the Isotropic Vector Matrix]. The entire set of ve ctors and their spatial points is called a vector field. In Bearden's approach, such a vector f ield"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"cannot observably exist in a vacuum, since only disintegrated things exist ther e. There each potential vector patterns exists broken into virtual bits, ord ered in line to form the bits of the observable vector but not joined. In the presence of a detecting/integrating mass, such as a spinning charge d electron the virtual bits and the spinning charged mass couple into a system that identically com prises the observable vector. In other words, the spin of an observable particle simply inte grates the ordered virtual bit pattern, just as an old spinning wheel twists and integrates individual fibers into a stranded thread or rope. VIRTUAL (HIDDEN OR OCCULT) ENTITIES All fundamental particles--photons, neutrons, protons, electrons, etc.--exhibit the sa me behavior. So things, nothings if you will, can be processed in the multiplistic two-st ates- identified-as-one-so-no-single-exclusive state (paradox, boundary, threshold), as virtual and unobserved entities. From ordinary, objective lab space nothing is processed, and indeed nothing is there, because these virtual hidden-variable nonthings are unobservable. Yet, this processa ble, structurable, nonobjective reality exists outside objective, three-law spacet ime and is the basis for all psychotronic phenomena. To our present monocular detection devices and monocular theory, such multiple-state entities are unobserved and hence are zeroes. They are pure vacuum, pure space, pure nothing, pure emptiness. But they are very real indeed, and they do physically exist, but multiocularly rather than monocularly. The virtual state is that part of physical reality consisting of changes (par ticles, waves, and other entities) smaller than the least detectable (quantum) change. Disintegrated changes. A thought or thoughtform is also virtual. Virtual ent ities may be visualized as consisting of real, dynamic \"pieces of vacuum\" or \"piece s of nothing\"--called quitons by Bearden. Every ordinary observable particle (photon, neutron, electron, proton, etc.) c ontains or consists of a dynamically changing cloud of virtual objects. Exchange of virtual objects is thought to generate almost all forces of nature. Conservation of ener gy need not be conserved in virtual interactions, and generally is not. In the new approach, the mind may be considered a special virtual univers e, and a thought a virtual object. The virtual state consists of multiply nested leve ls, each level progressively finer and more subtle. THESE SUBLEVELS ALSO CORRESPOND MATHEMATICALLY TO HIGHER GEOMETRICAL DIMENSIONS. Virtual particles in the vacuum flux arise out of nothing spontaneously (c reation) and disappear into nothing spontaneously (annihilation). Since this is r andom, at any instant any sort of pattern imaginable is \"just appearing\" and \"just disappearing\" in the vacuum. Thus a ghost-pattern of everything exists in t he vacuum at any point or region, at any time."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"THE VACUUM IS THUS A GIANT VIRTUAL-STATE HOLOGRAM. INTEGRATING (KINDLING) ONE OF THESE FORMS WILL RESULT IN IT BECOMING FIRST A NEUTRINIC PATTERN, THEN A PHOTONIC (LIGHT ) PATTERN, THEN A MATERIALIZING PATTERN, AND FINALLY A MATERIAL PATTERN. Discharge of the \"potential\" of this pattern then reverses the process. These two processes--charge-up and discharge--constitu te materialization and dematerialization. Anything at all--living or dead--can be materialized or dematerialized. The vacuum, as scalar field, is also the rigorous identity of a massless charge d field, of-- for example--the electrostatic scalar potential, 0. Also, the scalar f ield is considered to be composed of two time fields: one in positive time and one in negative time that is the phase conjugate replica of the first. Thus the timeless, lengthless vacuum exists both in positive and negative time, and its potentials are scalar potentials. When the vacuum is uncurved, equal amounts and components of positive and negative time exist. When it is curved at a point, the positive and negative time components are unbalanced at that point. VIRTUAL HYPERSPACE Zero is a relative term--relative to an observer. An observer who perceives nothi ng, registers nothing--but subtle reality can be quite different. An observer sees his own frame, and intersections in that frame, nothing else. He doe s not necessarily see the entire reality of any object, and if an object is in a f rame that does not intersect the observer's frame, the observer cannot detect that object at al l. Photons behave like massless particles. A photon has zero mass because it is a two- dimensional object and only three-dimensional objects have mass. A photon also has an infinite mass because it cannot be accelerated along its direction of travel, i .e. go faster than the speed of light. A photon is a perfectly ordinary three-dimensional partic le existing in a normal three-space that is one orthogonal turn away from the laborat ory three-space. Localized mass is merely the result of orthorotational flux in and out of that local ized space. This flux does not move through laboratory three-space, but rotates into and out of it, at and for each fundamental particle of mass in real-time three-space. T his hyperspatial flux is actually flowing or rotating in hyperspace. This is where the ordina ry spin of a fundamental particle comes from. Hyperspace flux lines are jittered because of modulations made by higher-fr equency components. This jitterbugging, as Fuller calls it, relates to paranormal phenom ena. We can look at hyperspace flux from the point of view of matter or mind. Materially it is a continual direct coherent collection of virtual subquanta to reach the quantum threshold, breach it and become observable quantum change. Virtual photons kindle and create electric fields and the charge of an electrically charged particle."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"From the point of view of our consciousness, hyperspace flux is a continual direct coherent collection of mind virtual state subquanta to reach the quantum threshold, breach it, and turn into observable quantum change (physical phenomena). THUS ALL MATTER IS TOTALLY MIND AND ALIVE--INERT MATTER IS JUST NONPREFERENTIALLY ALIVE. The resultant flux vector in an inert mass is ZERO since there exists as much flow out as in, and vice versa. THUS, WE ELIMINATE THE CLASSICAL DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MIND AND MATTER. Channels of least resistance exist to translate from one dimension to the other . It is easiest to establish them through the paths of least resistance--the magic frequenc y windows. Magic window induction works like a transducer. Modulation of the primary flux happens through jitter or dither. In the continual,virtual , subquantum, orthorotational flux (crosstalk), rotating into and out of a fundamental mass particle, only the components that are coherent are additive. Only those that add to the quantum threshold and breach it become observable quantum change. This is the threshold where it is possible for virtual mind to effec t virtual matter and real time. It is the basis of all magic, sympathetic response, synchronicit y, invocation, visualization, correspondences. The translation comes through th e process of kindling a response in the primary medium of expression (the virtual state entities). So be careful what you imagine, visualize, or even think of yourself. Because we can physically confirm that thoughts become things! Our self-image is per haps one of our most important creations. Our early experience of the environment condi tions this image greatly. It imprints fundamentals such as whether the world is a safe place to be or not. Trauma locks up energies in the body, and the self image can become \"frozen\" and inhibit growth of the personality, especially in its expression of one's H igher Self or H.G.A. This image can be de-structured or liquified, ( solutio ), eliminating the old holographic pattern, and returning all elements to a chaotic state. From th is chaos, the new image automatically emerges in regenerated form. This death/re birth is commonly referred to as healing, and may be the mechanism of the placebo effe ct. Self image is locked up in identification with a multi-sensory image of self. I t conditions the body and its state of health. The process of detachment from one's body, emotions, thoughts, and even the notion of self is a way of dis-identifying with the old outworn model, and creating a non-localized impression of oneself as contiguous with the universal consciousness. The \"self-simulation,\" (Tart, 1990), carries consciousness from moment to moment, e ven though that \"self\" fluctuates through a variety of states and conditions. These ar e \"internally generated virtual realities,\" according to \"altered st ates of consciousness\" expert, Charles Tart. He postulates a mechanism for self simulation and worl d simulation by boldly declaring that \" we all live inside a world simulation machine .\" (1)."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The magickal body or body of light or Diamond Body can be used for identification purposes for consciousness journeys to realms which supercede physical manifesta tion. The DB or VEM function simultaneously as vehicles of consciousness and psychotronic energy accumulators. They focus intent and will much like a crystal can focus light. The pro-active approach is \"learn--commit--do.\" Time is produced by the fission of the quantum of action. All remaining statistica l subquanta which have not collected to the threshold level are virtual subquanta of action possessing unfissioned, unseparated time. Each and every piece of time contains dynamic, nested, virtual subquanta. Time in observable changes may thus be said to possess an internal dynamic structure filled with such virtual subquantum mental, neutrino, and photonic entities. Mind becomes matter, it matters, when virtual-mental entities cohere fre quency wise until they breach the quantum threshold and discharge into observable quantum change. It is much like the accumulation of a static charge until sufficient potential is reached and a spark occurs, discharging the accumulation of charge. The same relationship exists between virtual-mental state and observable st ate. The only diference is that virtual-mental state accumulates by frequency or tim e phase. Perhaps you can draw your own conclusions about what this might mean concerning magical timing and tides, as well as regularity in practice. If you are going to charge your magickal machine, your altar which is the te mple of yourself (the temple of self amplification), there are protocols for maxi mizing the \"charge.\" This is also the basis of the magical egregor and group ritual. The \"many minds model\" has always contended that the force of concurrent magical visualization a nd effort is cumulative and exponential. At the quantum level, a physical change is totally statistical to a monocul ar observer, but this is not so when many minds are involved. It is why the quantum world is statistic al rather than causal. This mind/matter interface is not a causal model--your mind doesn't cause matter to change per se. The virtual entities you fantasize manipulat ing are mind or consciousness themselves--stuff that is not different from matter or yoursel f in its deepest essence. We can regard a fundamental particle as simply a complicated three-space tuning pattern existing in the orthorotational crosstalk flux between orthoframes. Our bodies are composed of nothing more than that. Thus we are \"vibrations\" just as the ancient Indians , Theosophists, psychedelic movement, and physics reveal. Thus each fundamental particle is a set of tuning frequencies in the flux. A stabl e particle is a stable spectrum comprised of standing waves. And again, we are that. And ye t the fabric of our being constantly comes and goes. We shed skin cells, and rotate our whole inards every seven years. Our atoms are continually being created, destro yed, or exchanged with the environment. Unstable particles are unstable sets, comprised of some standing waves, whi ch account for the duration, and some not-quite-standing waves, which account for the excited state"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"or degree of instability of the object. Particles can be destabilized by such subl iminal thoughts as \"I am a bad person, and deserve punishment.\" Core issues like this can lead t o thought patterns which de-stabilize systems in the body and lead to a diversity of di seases ranging from those described as psychosomatic to those which pronounce a death- sentence, such as cancer. Every fundamental particle is a tuning. We know this fundamentally when we speak metaphorically of being in and out of \"tune\" with our real- time life situation. Paradoxically the flux tunes and is the result of its tunin g. SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS AND THE PLENUM Current speculation about the nature of sub-quantum reality bears on the philosophical nature of the vacuum, the Void, and the persistent notion of a fundamental \"ether.\" Our approach is that of the alchemist who would unite psyche and matter. The quantum cosmology suggested by scalar electromagnetics finds mythic re sonance in Aleister Crowley's resurrection of the Egyptian deities, Nuit and Hadit, in THE BOOK OF THE LAW. Nuit is infinite space, that which is naught, the continuous One, the Void, infinite potential, the Plenum. Hadit is any point which has experience of these possibilities. Crowley also characterized it as motion. Their interaction r epresents the relationship of the Whole to the seemingly discrete. Nature has no absolute laws, and nothing is absolutely prohibited a priori. At the microscopic level, there is no such thing as a \"fixed\" or \"static\" anything. E verything is in incessant motion. What we see macroscopically as a \"fixed\" object is actuall y composed of very small parts that are always in violent motion. Macroscopically static \"force\" actually consists of a myriad of microv ectors, each moving and doing work against resistance. The macro static force is composed of mic ro work. Any vector can be replaced by two scalar fields. The interference of t wo scalar EM potentials constitutes a vector EM field. Any vector EM wave can be replaced b y two scalar EM waves. Waves of potentials (electrostatic and magnetostatic) exist in vacuum, and the c oupling of a spinning charged particle to these potential waves constitutes the force fiel d waves actually detected and measured by our instruments. SCALAR EM VIEW OF THE VACUUM The vacuum -- and spacetime -- can now be considered to be made of photon-structured gravitons and supergravitons. In other words, the \"graviton\" can be regarded as a \"piec e of the vacuum/spacetime medium.\" Gravitation is simply infolded and trapped electromagnetic energy, and elec tromagnetic energy is simply the outfolded contents of gravitational energy. Gravitational potential is \"locked up\" electromagnetic field while an EM field is \"unlocked gravitati onal potential.\" Vectorially speaking and roughly put, gravity is operationally zeroed or \"tr apped\" electromagnetics, and electromagnetics is operationally broken-out or \"ble d off\" gravity."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"In the modern quantum mechanical view, the vacuum is not an emptiness, but instead is a plenum or fullness (Puthoff, 1989). Today the vacuum is considered to be filled with incredible virtual particle activity. From nowhere, virtual particles conti nually arise -- even with fierce energy -- then disappear again into nowhere, so rapidly that they cannot be individually observed. However, these virtual particles are quite real, for the y cause all the forces of nature when they interact in the aggregate with observable particle s. Thus the vacuum is viewed as a seething inferno of virtual particle fluxes, and the concept of an ether is again accepted as referring to this \"virtual plasma\" o r \"virtual flux\" vacuum -- which is a far different ether than the old material ether that was theorized prior to relativity. CONTINUALLY, EVERY TYPE OF PARTICLE IMAGINA BLE SPONTANEOUSLY ARISES (CREATION) AND DISAPPEARS (ANNIHILA TION) AT EVERY POINT IN THE VACUUM, ACCORDING TO MODERN QUANTUM MECHANICS. The rate of this virtual particle creation and annihilation in the va cuum is essentially unlimited. Further, any virtual particle created has a flux of even finer particles a ssociated with it, and each of those has a yet finer flux associated, and so on without limit. The vacuum's virtual particle flux is thus comprised of nested levels of ever finer virtua l particle fluxes, in the modern view. Each deeper virtual level may be modeled as a higher dimension (hyperdimension), to yield an infinite-dimensional vacuum spacetime (hyperspa ce) that is identically the infinite nested levels of virtual state. At the same time, every nucleus in the universe is continually absorbing and emit ting scalar EM (electro-gravitational) waves, and these waves of pure potential are waves in the stress and structuring of the vacuum itself. HENCE, AT EVERY POINT IN THE VACUUM, AN INTENSE FLUX OF THESE SCALAR EM WAVES, WITH CONCOMITANT INTERFER-ENCES, EXISTS AND CAUSALLY DRIVES (CONSTITUTES) ALL THE ENORMOUS QUIVERING OF THE VACUUM SPA CE- TIME MEDIUM ITSELF. To the observer, from a purely statistical viewpoint, in this violent vacuum flux any and every finite patterning of particles is also continually being momentari ly created and destroyed -- and at every level and in every hyperdimension. THUS, IN THE VA CUUM THERE CONTINUALLY EXISTS -- AT ANY AND EVERY POINT, AND IN A NY AND EVERY REGION -- THE GHOSTLY IMAGE OF ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, WHETHER IN THE PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE; AND WHETHER POTENTIAL, PROBABILISTIC, OR ACTUAL.

Everything that is, or w as, or shall be; and everything that could be but isn't, wasn't, or shan't be: alre ady exist at once, anywhere and everywhere, in this ghostly, holographic, virtual state. This image of reality is directly implied by quantum mechanics. It is not metap hysics. There has been a problem of missing chaos in QM theory. Scalar waves seem to be the missing ingredient. The hidden order in the vacuum fluctuations shows them as chaotic instead of random, though still statistical.

Chaos displays certain qualitie s, all of which apply to scalar wave theory: nonlinear, dynamic, deterministic, far-fr om- equilibrium, disintegrated, negentropic systems of potential energy. WE CAN FURTHER EXAMINE THE FLUX OF ONE TYPE OF VIRTUAL PARTICLE THROUGH A POINT (Hadit) IN THE VACUUM (Nuit). Virtual particle flux creates a charge at that point. Various kinds of fluxes constitute various kinds of charge, and comprise various kinds of potentials. One type of charge may always be decomposed (disintegrated) into other kinds of charge, as can potentials. The magnitude of the electrostatic scalar potential at a point in vacuum repres ents the magnitude of the flux of virtual photons through the point, and hence the electrical charge at the point. The vacuum is filled with (and consists of) many types of \"potentials.\" The overall vacuum potential remains the same from point to point, though individual potentials may vary. We can view the vacuum/ether/spacetime as a special sort of gas, where th e \"gas\" is actually a mixture of many, many gases. This peculiar gas exists in five or m ore dimensions and is composed of very strange, fleeting particles which spontaneously ar e created and destroyed, each arising out of nowhere and returning to nowhere almost immediately. There is only miniscule (negligible) time overlap (integration) of the exist ence of these virtual particles in the main. Mostly each virtual particle -- along wit h its associated energy, movement, momentum, charge, and increment of time -- exists almost entir ely as an individual. Thus the energies, movements, momenta, charges, and time increments of the individual virtual particles do not integrate or sum to any appreciable degree. These are densities of disintegrated energy, momentum, and time flow. In scala r EM, the disintegrated energy of vacuum is termed ANENERGY. Virtual energy is disi ntegrated, observable energy is integrated. The integrating agent is usually the spin of a n observable particle of mass. The vacuum contains enormous anenergy, but essentially no energy . The \"energy density of vacuum,\" \"stress energy density,\" and \"vacuum ener gy,\" are misnomers. The Russians describe it as \"the information content of the field,\" but not i n the sense of normal communications theory. Maybe we should call it the \"unformation content.\" The realm of the vacuum is pregeometric. It has been described as vector zero summation, and described ext ensively by R. Buckminster Fuller in SYNERGETICS 1 and 2. But vector descriptions are w holly inadequate to describe something that is more fundamental than vectors. Fuller spoke of the VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM MATRIX because that was the most sophisticated language available then. He noted the weird mathematical anomaly at the c enter of the figure where normal space/time breaks down. But there are shortcomings in vector analysis. The concept of vector has both dire ction and magnitude, but a scalar has only magnitude, since it does not exist in the 3-space of Cartesian coordinates. Vector space is abstractly defined as a space whi ch can contain objects called \"vectors.\" Fuller called this system the ISOTROPIC VECTOR MATRIX,"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"an omnidirectional grid of tetrahedra filling all space. If scalars have any relationship to vectors, it is that they are perhaps the essence of disintegrated vectors - - chaos. \"Zero vector\" is an entity defined in vector analysis by a set of operations. It is simply \"the absence of any vector of finite magnitude.\" By implication, in ab stract vector theory, all zero-vectors are defined as identical. But this doesn 't include the influence of the real-though-intangible stress gradient in the vacuum . In the abstract mathematical model, vector space has no such thing as stress, and a zero-vecto r has no structure. That is why Vector Equilibrium is a \"system\" not a structure. Its anomalou s center is a chaotic, disassembled system. The presence of summing vector compon ent forces creates a stress and macroscopic structure in the physical med ium in and on which the forces are acting. Even in a vacuum, the stress of the medium an d its structure must be preserved and accounted for as charge and energy conver sion between one kind of charge/potential and another. SEPARATION OF VACUUM AND OBSERVABLE STATES Because the energy density of vacuum is unintegrated, an integrated physical body -- including one's own personal body -- can exist \"in\" the vacuum medium of incredible \"energy\" density, yet observably exist in a medium of zero energy density. T he unintegrated vacuum ether has enormous spatial density of virtual energy, but ess entially has zero spatial density of observable energy. In the hyperdimensional interpretation of the levels of virtual state, the vacuum spatially does not exist in the normal 3-space of observable matter. The vacuum occupies the 4th dimension (time) and all spatial dimensions (hyperdimensions) greater than the t hird -- it occupies all levels of virtual state, but not observable state. Exchanges occur between normal 3-space and the hyperspatial vacuum, through the common connecting dimension, time. Exchanges of virtual particles are integrat ed by the spinning observable particle into the first quantally excited state -- \"coll apse of the wave function,\" the production of unitary quantum change, and the discretizing of observable change. Time is the only \"dimension\" where everything (Nuit) can be considered to occup y the same \"point\" (Hadit) or interval, but it is discretized and chopped into pieces, quite different in nature from the familiar three spatial dimensions of the observabl e universe. The dimensional separation (spatially) of the seething vacuum \"energy\" (anene rgy) and the 3-space of normal matter allows a physical body to interact with the vacuum ( chaos) at or near equilibrium at the microscopic level, but maintain its macroscopic form and stability. Vacuum/spacetime consists entirely of potentials, nothing else , and these are hyperspatial a priori. The vacuum does not contain force fields per se, nor any other non- potential entity. No vector force exists in vacuum. Force is an effect not a cause. A differentiating operator must be applied to (coupled to) a potential in order to produc e a force field. The most usual is an observable spinning charged particle which coupl es to"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"the stream of virtual photons. Its spin integrates the unobservable, disintegrated ane nergy of the gradient flux into integrated, observable energy of the particle. This trans lates into the observable electric field which is only a potential in vacuum. If potential exists as an unintegrated virtual particle flux (VPF), it can be \"zipped\" and \"unzipped\" as force. The electrostatic scalar potential is composed of a myri ad of little individual virtual-particle \"electric force field\" vectors, the smear o f the virtual particle moving over time. When these little virtual vectors are essentially separa te and unintegrated, the electric field is unzipped in vacuum, the E-field vectors are unintegrated. A potential is always an unzipped vector field of unintegrated virtua l vectors. The spin of an observable charged particle zips or integrates an energy. The spin of the observable particle acts as the \"zipper.\" Vacuum is unzipped; observable mass is zipped. Any zipped entity exists observably in 3-space; any unzipped entity exists i n hyperspace, and is unobservable and virtual to the 3-space observer. This interpretation is still consistent with the quantum mechanical view, where ultimately all observable forces are considered to be generated by absorption and emission of vi rtual particles by/from an observable particle (mass). So force becomes an eff ect, not a cause. The primary causative agents are potentials, not force fields, as is now firml y established in QM. Zero-summed EM force vector systems stress the vacuum. A patterned syst em of oppositive forces forms a stress in the vacuum medium. It is the alchemical \"hol ding the tension of the opposites.\" This stress is oscillation. This oscillation which we ca ll a scalar electromagnetic wave is a GRAVITATIONAL WAVE, since the local curva ture of spacetime is being oscillated. This internal stress in the medium has several characteristics whi ch identify it as chaotic in essential nature. 1) it has a DETERMINISTIC pattern or substructure; 2) it patterns or \"polarizes\" the vacuum; 3) it constitutes local curvature of spacetime 4) it deterministically engineers the virtual state and local spacetime ; 5) it affects the Schroedinger wave and the probabilities of the states propagated forward, leading to the possibility of engineering the emergence of quantu m change; 6) the scalar wave can accomplish direct and localized change of the rate of fl ow of time (even to its reversal) and variation of mass and inertia without transl ation of matter; 7) since excess negative time flow may be locally produced, NEGENTROPY may b e locally produced. When the vectorially zeroing components are dynamic, the scalar resultant is dynamic. The dynamic scalar term is the scalar EM wave."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"ENGINEERING THE VACUUM A \"vectorially zeroed\" EM system (Vector Equilibrium Matrix) stress es and deterministically structures local spacetime. It changes the energ y density of the local vacuum, and curves local spacetime. Spacetime curvature must be of such directi on that a local energy \"source\" exists. This curvature affects the local flow of ti me. Negentropy is a direct result of a local curvature of spacetime. The \"locally trapped energy\" constitutes a potential. This vectorially zero ed EM system, which has trapped its dynamic energy inside a local area, creates and cons titutes an artificial potential in the local vacuum. This potential means dynamically s tructuring the vacuum, the virtual state through hidden variable theory. With this technology we can directly engineer quantum change, skew or change the probabilities propagated by the Schroedinger wave, and engineer the atomic nucleus directly with miniscule power. One simply oscillates each component of the z eroing structure in common phase, always maintaining the overall zero EM vector res ultant as a scalar wave or gravitational wave. Scalar EM theory makes it possible to model the mind and its relationship to physic al reality. It is the mechanism allowing mind to affect matter, for example i n healing. Mind consists of EM fields. Passage of an electromagnetic wave through the vacuum le aves an invisible trace. The vacuum \"imprints\" everything that happens in it. This imprint i s electrogravitational; i.e. the imprinting process structures the substructur e of vacuum spacetime (the artificial potential of vacuum). The vacuum/ether/spacetime is composed of gravitons. This means that the mind/memory/personality are centered in dynamic photon structures inside str uctured gravitons, which in turn comprise artificial potentials that are centered in the a tomic nuclei of the matter in the body. In the late 1960s, Lisitsyn reported that the Soviets had broken the \"genet ic code\" of the human brain. He stated the code had 44 digits or less, and the brain emp loyed 22 frequency bands across nearly the whole EM spectrum (note the 22 Paths of the Tree of Life, 22 Tarot Trumps, 22 primary archetypal modes of information transfer and feedback). However, only 11 of the frequency bands were independent (\" 11 is the key to all the rituals. \"). This work implies that, if 11 or more correct frequency channels can b e \"phase locked\" into the human brain, then it should be possible to drast ically influence the thoughts, vision, physical functioning, emotions, and consci ous state of the individual, even from a great distance. The human brain and nervous system use highly complex substructuring of gravitons and supergravitons, rather than photons to perform mind functions.

If you control c harge and charge distribution in the body, you can control all the biochemistry of the body, with miniscule voltages and currents. Engineering the vacuum may lead to true transmutation of the elements. If two we ak monochromatic EM waves are run together 180 degrees out of phase, and run through a nonlinear medium so that they modulate each other and lock together, they make a strange \"scalar EM wave\" that is an electrogravitational wave of pure pote ntial, and one that you are controlling. Such a wave goes down through the electron shells of the atoms, and is absorbed in the nucleus. If you choose the right mix of waves in the scalar wave, and just keep irra diating the nuclei with that \"pattern,\" the nuclei will gradually rearrange th emselves. For example, they will be transmuted into another element, given the proper signal mix. T hat is how biological systems transmute elements using millivolts and microwatt s of power (Kervan effect). The scalar EM wave passes through the electron shells of the atom essentiall y without interaction, entering the nucleus. There it is dephased and absorbed, exciting the nu cleus in a particular, structured manner. The nuclear potential is increased by as suming the imposed deterministic substructure. The nucleus will slowly charge up with the impressed pattern, steadily \"kindli ng\" (linearly integrating) a common virtual pattern until the observable threshol d is breached and observable change occurs in the nucleus. Depending on the structure imposed on the scalar wave and in turn upon the charging nuclear potential, various actions--like transmutation can be created directly in the nucleus itself. MIND IS OBJECTIVE A point (Hadit) can be considered to be, and modeled as, a line in a frame one orthogonal turn away, and simultaneously as a plane two orthogonal turns away, and simultaneousl y as a solid (in fact, an entire three-dimensional physical world) three orthogonal rotations away. THE LATTER MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED TO BE, AND MODELED AS, A MIND, OR EVEN AS AN IN-FOLDED SET OF MINDS. The concept does not stop at three dimensions, but proceeds into higher realms indefinitely. However, three dimensions plus an orthogonal time dimension are sufficient for our purposes. TIME IS MIND. In time differentiating, mass loses the time dimension. T herefore we cannot see time with a mass perceiver, but we can see spatial extension (Cart esian coordinates, Lorentz frame, Cube of Space). But time is the only so-called objec tive dimension occupied or shared by mind. Therefore we also cannot normally perceive the mind because the dimension time is lost in the perception process. Time does not exist except with respect to between one spatial extension percepti on and another, if the only output signal is the 3-space of natural perception.

Mind is thus present in four-dimensional physical phenomena and is discretized along with time discreteness in the Heisenberg uncertainty r elation. Mind creates time by establishing and comparing 3-space realities. The only place the former perception of 3-space can rigorously be found is in memory. An event, once occurred, is in the past and is forever gone to the observer. Only in his memory can i t be said to exist. But then so is the observation also of the most recent event. Thus rigorousl y, OBSERVED PHENOMENA MAY BE SAID TO EXIST ONLY IN MEMORY, and there is only a past, never a present.

On the boundary interface (such as skin), one type of field may be turned into another. The psychotronic field (biofield) may be turned into an electromagnetic field and vic e versa. The boundary interface serves as a transfer function mechanism for tra nslating one kind of effect into another. Both ends of the transfer functions are excitonically unite d in and on the interface. For example coherence of cyclic rhythms like breath and he artbeat during psychokinesis. Man, earth, and cosmos are psychotronically and coherently linked. The boundary of an object is a transducer coupling internal and external dynamic changes in one-to -one correspondence. The transducer effect applies to both living and nonliving systems . Through tuning and resonance, internal patterns can be incepted externally, and ext ernal patterns can be incepted internally. (For more on resonance effects and consc iousness, see STALKING THE WILD PENDULUM , Itzhak Bentov, E.P. Dutton, New York, 1977). Local curvature of spacetime means a thing in one frame can be something quit e different in another frame, in respect to the observer's static frame. What a thing is, i s totally relative to the perceiver and his perceiving frame. It can even be nothing in a grea t many frames. THIS IS HOW NOTHING (NUIT) CAN CONTAIN EVERYTHING (HADIT). So we really can turn nothing into something if we are clever. We can tap zero-point energy, psychotronically (mentally) and physically. We have a scheme of multiple worlds and multiple realities from which we may construct living systems, thoughts, tulpas, etc. And we may also turn one type of field into anothe r, simply by virtual state collection or separation, as the case may be. Some frames are mental or virtual, yet they are just as real as 3-space entities. In this system mind is modeled in terms of physics and physical reality is modeled in terms of mind. The only difference between any two entities in the various worlds is a matter of ort hogonal rotation. EVERYTHING IS A THOUGHT IN AT LEAST ONE FRAME. EACH ENTIT Y IS A PHOTON IN AT LEAST ONE FRAME (LET THERE BE LIGHT!). By orthog onal (90 degree) rotation, a thing can change its face with respect to an observer, appe aring to change into a totally different sort of thing with respect to a fixed object in one f rame. Reality is quite plastic and absolutely unlimited."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Materialization of an object, by three receding orthogonal rotations, exists. In such a case the dematerialized object appears the same as a thought object or virtual obje ct. A perfectly valid mechanism thus exists for tulpoids, materialized thought forms (U.F.O., Bigfoot, etc.). All that is needed is a sufficient virtual state collection me chanism (such as Vector Equilibrium Matrix). An object may be kindled from a remote frame to one that is less remote. Two successive applications of kindling turns thought into electromagn etic field. Three kindlings turns a thought object into a materialized object, a tulpoid (a Tibetan Buddhist term). \"Biofields and Tulpoids\" Such a materialized thought-object may be of an inert object or of a living, breathi ng, biological being. The model we are working in has eliminated any superficial difference between living and nonliving because it is a four-law model. A materialized living being will be just as real and physical and functional as any other person on this earth. Ultimately, that is all that we ourselves are -- tulpoids. NOTHING EXI STS BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE INFINITE CREATOR, AND WE ARE SIMPLY PART OF TH AT THOUGHT. The coherence in multiple stages necessary to accomplish kindling is often refer red to as tuning in this book. Tuning sufficient to enable two orthogonal rotations results in thought turning into electromagnetic field or light. Such a kindled field may be addi tive or subtractive to existing electromagnetic fields. Thus kindling can cancel an electromagnetic field that already exists, or it can create one where none previously existed, or it can shape, modulate, or change one which already exists. Kindling can also wipe out the charge on a charged particle, or it can buil d up a charge on an object which previously had no electric charge. Any changing entity in any frame crosstalks a tiny amount into any other frame, but it may be so small as to be virtual, hence unobservable. Coherent virtual crosstalk, integrates and can breach the threshold between virtual and observable state. Another point to notice is that most fundamental particles in a frame rarely move w ith ocntstant velocity. Instead, they normally accelerate and decelerate cont inually. Thus the actual velocity vector of one of these entities is continually changing, usuall y quite erratically (chaotic?). But for microscopic particles in regular at omic or crystalline formations, the change pattern is quite regular. (Ref. the DIAMOND BODY). The constant changes on the velocity induce a jitter component on its crosstalk into ot her bioframes (see Fuller on \"jitterbug\" transforms of V.E.M. and octahedron). So the crosstalk into a frame is jittery. Thus a fundamental particle is jittery or wavelike. The fine structure constant of an electron encompasses this hyperspatial ji tter or wavelike state of the electron."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The fine structure constant is about 1/137. Thus an electron actually spends about 1/137 of the time in hyperspace. Because of jitter, an object is partially in every hyperframe a minute but finite part of the time. So are all minds and mental objects, and so are all virtual objects. The identity coefficient shows how much the fundamental particle pervades anothe r frame. For an electron to orbit in an atom (or for any other electron, for that mat ter) there is a small but finite probability that the electron may be at any given posit ion in the universe when its detection occurs. In other words, there is a finite probability of collecting an electron at any point (Hadit) in the universe (Nuit), and the col lection may be made from multiple points simultaneously. Space-point, mind, and thought are virtually synonymous. BIOFIELDS AND TULPAS: PROJECTION AS REALITY By proper coherent tuning through time synchronization, an object from a maverick world of fantastic possibilities can be orthorotated into our own frame and objectif ied. THIS IS WHAT TIBETAN MONKS CALL A TULPA, AN OBJECTIVE MATERIALIZATION OF A THOUGHT-FORM. The tulpa will hardly ever be cl osed entirely in phase, however, and so it will almost always be unstable. UFO's, angels , and imps go away. But the materialization of one of these can be entirely objective and perfect ly objective traces can be left, such as photographs, broken limbs, scorched asphalt, indentations, and depressions in grassy fields. Any thought object can be so orthorotated and objectifie d. Beings, religious figures, angels, fairies, imps, UFO's, and monsters can al l appear. At death, the now disembodied mind finds itself in its own deep, unconscious world constructs. Reincarnation is simply the resonant coupling which automatically e stablishes itself in the flux. The disembodied, confused mind will simply be coupled again to a new physical body pattern. This happens at the instant of conception, for the genetic pat tern-- the complete tuning pattern--is present at that instant. The coupling is quite tenuous at first, and increases in degree as the embryo develops. So, the cycle of rebirth can be broken completely--simply by dying with a total ly detached mental framework. The cessation of all tuning attachment results in structureless, hence all-structured being, part of universal Godness. THE MA JOR POINT IS THAT ALL THIS CAN BE MODELED PHYSICALLY. THERE IS ONLY LIF E; ABSENCE FROM ONE PLACE STILL LEAVES PRESENCE IN ANOTHER. Abs ence from any and every one place exclusively leaves presence at all places, e ach nonexclusively. CONSCIOUSNESS -- THE THREAD OF THE RELATION BETWEEN CONSE CU- TIVE CHANGES IN THE TWO RESPEC-TIVE FRAMES -- AND TIME ARE IDENTICAL. Time is a duration of consciousness.

Incepting a change from pure causality changes t he past. The past is causally inferred or projected backward from the new vectorial direction. I nception of course also changes the future slightly. Hidden variable theory (chaos) which causes a radioactive nucleus to decay, is al so a mechanism which can directly amplify the virtual-mental state into observabl e state. It is the fundamental mechanism that causes kindling and thus orthorotation. It can be used to materialize tulpas, accomplish psychokinesis, clairvoyance, precongition, et c. The effect is based on the concept that a human being must accomplish a minute inception onto his phsycial system. Specifically, he must incept the movement of thre e or four electrons in the brain. This input signal into his physical system amplifies t he movement of several electrons into powerful movements of the entire body. Intelligence may be viewed as the ability to adapt behavior, and increased inte lligence represents a decrease in the portion of behavioral control that is genetically pr ogrammed or \"hard-wired.\" The common crosstalk in all minds constitutes the collective unconscious. Since the common crosstalk is in a sense a mind, and since it is connected to a \"body\" of many cells, i.e. of four billion humans or so, then this collective unconscious is a living, breathing entity. Most of what we term physical reality is prescribed by the collective human unconscious. And if the collective human unconscious is changed in its conception of reality, then four billion stages start kindling with the hyperchannel e ffect, and immediately the new conception is physical reality. BORROWING FROM JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGY, LET US CALL EACH FORM THAT IS IN EACH HUMAN MIND AN ARCHETYPE. Let us also realize that there are shallower levels of unconsciousness between the total collective unconscious and an individual mind. An archetype that is kindled from the collective unconscious is kindled through such a mechanism of unconscious levels of tuning, and the reality format that is kindled is determined by the type of pressure and the content, biases, or tuning of all t he levels between it and the conscious minds of the individuals who observe the phenomena. All tulpoidal manifestations are kindled through this mechanism. All of them are sh aped by the multilevel unconscious tuning. ALL OF THEM ARE CAUSED BY AN UNRESOLVED CONFLICT IN THE DEEPER UNCONSCIOUS LAYERS. Though short-lived because of unstable tuning, any tulpoidal materialization may be phy sically real during its stable period.

An infinite number of reality channels exists. The total instrumental charac terstics, genetic, psychological, and physiological, of the observers who tune in the channe l determines the noise content and actual channel selected. A reality is simply an orthogonal frame or world. All possible realities exist.

Tuning is a complex of mind and matter, and of many unconscious levels. By time coherence in the virtual state, a virtual entity can be amplified into obs ervable state. From sheer nothing (Nuit) we can produce something (Hadit). And since every possible something exists in nothing and is available for cohering, we can get an ything at all by this process, at least hypothetically. DREAMS AS UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS Everything is essentially mind. Mind forms layer after layer of overlappi ng zones of shallower and shallower unconsciousness (multiple simultaneous consciousness), al l the way from the universal allness (Nuit) to the personal unconscious (Ra Hoor Khuit). It culminates in each conscious mind. JUST AS THE DREAMS OF AN INDIVIDUAL SHOW HIS UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS, SO THE MATERIALIZED TULPOIDS OF THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN UNCONSCIOUS SHOW ITS UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS. At the other e nd of the spectrum, a human culture seeks and \"obtains\" a godform or god-image consist ent with its own level of understanding and belief. The resulting tulpoidal activity conditioned into the collective unconscious and the cultural unconscious, and tuned in from them, will be consistent with the cultural desires and expectations. So in a sense we are the creators of our own reality and our own tulpoidal expressi ons of higher reality. But in addition to tulpoids, the present character of spacetime and dimensionality, and the very laws of the physical universe, are largely prosc ribed by the collective human unconscious. VIRTUAL CHAOS VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM AS ZERO MODEL; ZEROPHASE: Being the zerophase of energy the vector equilibrium is inherently invisible and non- empirically-discoverable, which accounts for its having been for so long unrecognized as the spontaneous equilibrious model. As specialists, scientists seek only the somethings. The vector equilibrium is the only model of nonbeing zero-inflection at the nomoment of omniintertransformabilities, where anything can happen and must happen single-atomically within and multiatomically without. Speciali-zing science, seeking only somethings, inherently overlooked the nonthing vector equilibrium. Vector equilibria in isotropic vector matrix produce the discontinuity of particles, while the vector-weaving around the VE nucleus produce the continuity of wave phenomena. The vector equilibrium is the most abstract of all the always-and-only abstract scientific generalizations, for it is the heart of all interrelationships existi ng between -- and not in or of -- any of all the empirically apprehended intertrans- forms of the every-and-everywhere intertransforming Scenario Universe.

Buckminster Fuller, SYNERGETICS 2 VIRTUAL STATES AND HYPERSPACES In physics today there are two separate kinds of reality: observable change s, which can be detected by instruments; and virtual changes, which cannot be detected by instrument s, even in theory. Changes smaller than the quantum level are said to be \"virtual\" and undetectable, and changes larger than this are said to be observable and detectable. Virtual changes are not bound by the conservation of mass law. And virtual photons can have nonzero mass. Rotation just past the critical angle corresponds to a Lorentz-Fitzgera ld contraction into the virtual state below the quantum threshold of the detector's observable universe. B ut there is a jump effect which happens during the orthorotation of light, or accelerati on to the speed of light. Mass turns into photons during the final part of orthorotation which is in the virtual state. This is the missing link between relativity and quantum mecha nics. Continued rotation into hyperspace passes through successively finer, nested virt ual sublevels or subthresholds of lab space. (of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contracti on). The successive breaching of deeper thresholds is due to continued Lorentz-Fitzger ald contraction. Higher hyperspatial frames constitute nested sublevels in the vir tual state with respect to the laboratory observer. Thus a direct connection exists between virtual levels and hyperspace fram es. HYPERSPACES AND VIRTUAL SUBLEVELS ARE THE SAME THING. Every \"virtual\" object in lab space is an \"observable\" object in some hyperspace. Hy perspatial engineering and virtual state engineering are one and the same thing, and this i s what PSYCHOTRONICS and SYNERGETICS are all about. For physical, observable systems, we can model six vectors for every point (Ha dit). This is the natural geometry of nuclear structural systems. The most economic sy stem is 12 around 1, closest packed spheres--the intertriangulated geometry of the atom ic nucleus. The vector equilibrium is the prime, nucleated structural system of Universe. Fuller says, \" The behavioral interpatterning frame of reference of the six degrees of freedom in respect to omnidirectionality is of course the vector equilibrium, which embraces the three-dimensionality of the cube and the six-dimensionality of the vector"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"equilibrium. Experience is inherently omnidirectional; ergo, there is always a minimum of 12 \"others\" in respect to the nuclear observing self.\" Because NUIT is the time/space continuum, time must be \"nothing,\" much like the voi d of the purely spatial dimension. Time may be considered as a sort of box containing all observables and virtuals. Indeed, time is neither observable nor virtual; time is si mply a parameter in quantum mechanics. Rigorously, time may be said not to exist. Indian philosophy identifies universal mind with time, and calls it Kal, Lord of Karma. TIME ITSELF IS NOTHING, TOTALLY NOTHING. Therefore by the fourt h law of logic (identity of opposites at the boundary--paradox), it can be said to be or contain everything, the total mishmash of virtuals and observables. Since in the absolute sens e there is no such thing as time, then all modeling of space, mind, thing, and nonthing must be done spatially. Relativity theory attempts to use time as an existent dimens ion of the same kind as length, limiting rotation in lab space only in the direction of the time a xis in Minkowski geometry of spacetime. Spatial modeling requires an infinite dimensional space (NUIT) and an infinite numbe r of orthogonal angles. The time axis that can be drawn in such a hyperspatial model has no meaning except with respect to a relationship existing between two or more hyp erspace frames or objects. Specifically, the time axis represents the totality of all the hyperspaces and their objects, hence all the relationships that can be separated from the hy perspace. The charge on an electron is due to the continual emission and absorption of virtual photons (little electromagnetic pieces of vacuum, the space/time flux, or lit tle pieces of nothing. The simple movement of the electron is actually composed of a virtual cloud -- an infinite number of an infinite number of an infinite number of things (manifold), all happening in a mad tangle of nested substrata in the virtual state. Each of these virtuals with respect to lab space is in fact an observable in some par ticular hyperspace. Many other sorts of virtual particles are emitted and absorbed a nd born and extinguished, in addition to photons, by various observable particles in free space. EVERYTHING IN EVERY POSSIBLE WORLD OR HYPERSPACE IS RELAT ED TO EACH AND EVERY OTHER THING IN THE LABORATORY WORLD THROUGH ORTHOROTA-TIONS AND NESTED VIRTUAL STATES. Cross talk between hyperframes is the emergence and disappearance of virtua l particles in a particular frame. The universe is holographic. IF ANY PART OF THIS VIRT UAL CHAOS CAN BE COLLECTED AND COHERED IN EVEN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE, ANY AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE FREE ENERGY CAN BE OBTAINED. But back to our electron. If we now remove the electron, leaving empty vacuum, all sor ts of virtual madness is still there and occurring. Vacuum is infinitely dense and f illed with stupendous \"zero point\" vacuum energy; IT IS TOTALLY CHAOTIC AND VIRTUA L. Space itself is an infinite tangle of virtuals -- virtual projections from real observables in associated hyperspaces -- and these dynamic interactants make up any three- dimensional"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"space and hyperspace itself. They are also what cause space itself to ex hibit the finite nonzero parameters or values that must be accounted for in our physical equations. EVERY FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT OF NATURE IS DYNAMICALLY CONSTRUCTED FROM -- AND DUE TO -- THE ZERO POINT, VIRTUAL VACUUM INTERACTIONS THAT CONSTITUTE \"EMPTY\" SPACE (NUIT). THE VIRTUAL \"SEA\" OF SEETHING WAVES AND PARTICLES THAT IS EMPTY VACUUM IS ACTUALLY AN ETHER -- A NON MATERIAL VIRTUAL ETHER. It is perfectly admissible by the Michelson-Morley experimen t and consistent with the entire experimental basis of physics. EINSTEIN ONCE PROPOSED NAMING THE VACUUM AND ITS CONTAINED FIELDS THE \"ETHER,\" BUT HIS SUGGESTION WAS NOT HEEDED. We now know something quite unusual about an electromagnetic wave and about a photon. Because it oscillates with respect to time, the wave moves along the axis of velocity in lab space for single wavelength, then repeats itself again and agai n. The oscillation actually represents an orthogonal, rotating etheric or hyperspat ial flux about the velocity vector. All three vectors of an EM wave are comprised of nested tan gles of virtual subvectors. This spinning (exploding and imploding) flux is coming into lab space from outside it (from virtual states) and returning into virtual states. It is a nutrino flux. (S ee Fuller for the synergetics of explosion/implosion; they relate to VEM). If the sine-w ave cycle has enough energy, it leads to pair production, the creation of an electron and a positron. The positron is an electron traveling backward in time, just as Dirac predicted. During any time interval--including the period of a single oscillation of a photon --a photon may be considered to consist of an infinite number of virtual happenings, each consisting of an infinite number of subhappenings, and so on. It is much like the fractal nature of self-generation and self-iteration in nature. It repeats its elf at all levels of organization. The photon itself may be considered to have a direct, nested virtual substructure, and thi s substructure is directly hyperspatial in nature as well. ACTUALLY THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD IS NOT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FIELD, BUT IS SOMETHING THAT IS TORN OUT OF, OR SEPARATED FROM, A MORE FUNDAMENTAL FIELD: THE VECTOR POTENTIAL. Maxwell's equations and the normal concept of an EM wave and single frequency thus represents only gross envelops of the actual forms and structure of waves and fields. The personality covers and distorts the essence or soul in much the same way. NEUTRINIC WAVES CAN BE REGARDED AS A CIRCULATING OR SPIRALI NG WAVE IN AN EM FIELD. This may well be the spinning wave of orgone energy identified by Reich. Neutrinic waves interact more strongly with strong ele ctrical or magnetic fields. The degree of interaction increases nonlinearly with the intensity of the fields with which the interaction occurs."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"We presently regard an EM wave as a wiggle of nothingness, existing in time. T his is precisely the same as saying that a photon is an oscillation (wiggling) of spac etime itself. Specifically, it oscillates in two directions spatially, one being the el ectric field direction and the other the magnetic field direction. But since an EM wave itself constitutes a regular bending and flexing and curvi ng of spacetime, including both space and time, then the flexing spacetime inside the photon can itself be further bent or twisted, and that constitutes a kinked or curved photon--a modulated photon. It is nonlinear, but our lab space instruments demodulate such a kinked photon into its linear components. Still the modulation of a wave results in direct changes in the vir tual structure of the formerly unmodulated photon, relativistically warping or curving it. A mixture of waves and frequencies must automatically possess, carry, or repre sent hyperspatial-virtual patterns in the correct nonlinear medium that absorbs them . When we modulate a wave, we impress a time change on it, we differentiate it. We impress a differential operator function on it. In other words, to modulate an electromagnetic carrier wave is to add a hyperdimensional aspect -- spec ifically, neutrinic vector aspects of mind aspects. The whole affair can be thought of as merely shi fting or altering the particular distribution of nested virtuals transported by the basic carrier wave. When we form a mixture of waves, we are adding virtual aspects (and hyperspatia l aspects) in so doing, because of the phase differences. This is extremely import ant: COMPLEX MIXTURES OF WAVES AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE AND CARRY HYPERSPATIAL COMPON-ENTS. Complex, dynamic mixtures are c haotic. And if we can accurately control these hyperspatial components, we are in effe ct doing direct hyperspatial engineering and virtual state engineering. By us ing two orders of modulation on a carrier, we can directly affect mindstuff itself. Time spikes can be introduced across the body as pulsed voltages. They are modulated directly on the dendrite firings of the brain and nervous system, providing direct and pulsed modulation of the neutrinic and mindfield component channels of the mind-brain- consciousness-life loop itself. Hyperspatial engineering, virtual state engineering, curved space, photon kindling , mind- life-consciousness engineering, and nested modulation are all the same thing. W e directly engineer the virtual state, hyperspace, curved spacetime, and the life-consc iousness loop itself, including the mind, with relatively simple devices that accomplish, tra nsmit, and receive nested orders of modulations. For each modulation pattern, a particular virt ual structure is impressed on the photon, which is the same as impressing a particula r hyperspatial pattern upon it. Fundamental CHAOS shows up in cellular biology. In studying cellular electroma gnetic bioactivity, the cell behaves as a system far from thermal equilibrium (deter ministic chaos).

IT'S ALIVE Stress-producing metaphysical gas stretches and strains nature to yield into social-evolution conformations such as the gas-filled plastic tube of Universe. --R. Buckminster Fuller The secret of the universe is that it's alive. Einstein's spherical model of the c osmos is a primary example of a holographic universe. In such a closed spacetime, each point inside the universe is also at the extreme end of the universe in any direction. Thus the entire physical universe (Nuit) is totally outside any of its internal points, and total ly inside each internal point (Hadit) as well. THE TOTAL INTERNAL IS IDENTICAL TO THE TOTAL EXTERNAL. It is proposed that each fundamental particle having electric charge repres ents a dual closure of the entire physical universe. The gravitational field closure is slow and weak, and it is that closure which results in the so-called external physical univers e. Harking back to quantum cosmology, we can speculate that our universe has many of the traits of a living thing. It was in a sense born from a hyperdimensional blac k hole in another stretch of spacetime, in another geometric realm. Physicist Lee Smolin of Syracuse University has postulated that universe s are born to strive and live and die. They change form little by little--or evolve. A universe ma y give rise to a number of new universes, throughout its individual history. As in natural selection, the offspring with the most successful survival strategies prevai l. The whole collection of universes may be said to evolve. Drawing inspiration from the Gaia Hypothesis, he extrapolates that the univers e may be a mother, hatching baby universes that live and die, and, like the organic species of the earth, evolve. (See OMNI, Oct. 92, \"The Bubbling Universe\"). The universe, galaxy, and earth sustains life through a series of interrelated feedback loops. If one applies quantum theory to the geometry of spacetime as described by Eins tein's theory of relativity, one can conclude that very tiny fluctuations in spaceti me are taking place around us all the time. As a result, occasionally, a piece of our universe might bulge"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"out, like a weak spot in an inner tube. Extending via a thin wormhole, the blob would stretch until the frail link snapped, leaving an isolated entity of space and time disconnected from our universe--a \"baby cosmos,\" where the laws of physics mig ht be quite different from our own. Coleman, Hawking, Baum, and Strominger have proposed that our own universe may \"give birth\" to offspring of a sort. Most are submicroscopic entities a billi onth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a centimeter across. A great proportion would pop awa y from the parent cosmos only briefly before being reabsorbed. But a few might have the potential of turning into something much more vivid and impressive. Such \"buds\" can suddenly and extravagantly \"flower,\" turning swiftly into gigantic, rapidly e xpanding entities massive enough to contain billions of galaxies; each entity constitutes a full- blown universe of its own. HOW COULD A TEENY-WEENY QUANTUM FLUCTUATION BOOT-STRAP ITSELF INTO A FULL-FLEDGED COSMOS? (Ref. the \"butterfly effect \" of chaos theory, pumping from micro- to macro- effects). With help from the dense, virtually inescapable center of a black hole, where the density of matter and energy bec omes infinite. Just before matter in a black hole reaches singularity, a baby univer se begins to expand. Our universe could have grown from the inside of a black hole in another universe. This reflects the mythic Qabalistic creation story of emanation of Kether, the So urce, from the three negative veils of existence. Darwinism applies not just to organic life f orms, but over megacosmic dimensions as well. We owe our existence and physical laws to the trial-and-error evolution of untold generations of prior universes, a chain of mother -and- child cosmoses, each of them spawned in the nurturing depths of black holes. (Ref. days and nights of Brahma=Om=108, number of the Universe). * 1999 Update: All is motion, without and within. There is no force field in the vacuum, as such. But we can think of it as \"virtual,\" rather than \"observable.\" A virtual electric force field exists in the vacuum, comprised of accele rating virtual masses, but not an observable field. This is beyond the physical, and into th e metaphysical domain. Observable particles can exist only in a physical med ium. The ambient vacuum stress (potential) has a hidden internal wave structur e. Its synergetic compressive stress reacts internally against atoms with t heir inner and outer parts. Reaction from the nucleus induces a tensile stress, wh ich can be decomposed into opposing forces. The vacuum may become the central ingredient of 21st-century physics. It is technically metaphysical -- beyond the realm of physics because it is virt ual, rather than manifest. These causeless fluctuations in energy create force f ields that emerge from nowhere. Particles flit in and out of existence at the threshold of matter. Virtual subatomic particles pop out of nothing and instantaneously disapp ear. Therefore, so-called \"empty\" space is not empty at all, but a seething sea of act ivity that pervades the entire Universe."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"The vacuum \"sea\" is an inexhaustible reservoir of energy. Its permanent posi tive energy density is synergetically balanced by a negative pressure (a tension). T his relates directly to the newest concepts about cosmic inflation in cosm ology. Inflation predicts that the density of mass-energy in the Universe is right on the borderline between expansion and collapse. Vacuum energy can account for some of the missing mass predicted for the Universe. The rest is accounted for through inertia. Inertia is generated by acceler ation through the vacuum. Fluctuations in the vacuum give rise to a magnetic fiel d through which all objects move. As they accelerate, each particle feels the grip of this magnetic field, and that resistance is inertia. The larger the objec t, the more inertia. By altering the vacuum state, it could be possible to alter the ine rtia of objects. This opens a host of engineering possibilities. The vacuum plays a key role in structuring the Universe. Astrophysicists s ays that the vacuum accelerates charged particles, sweeping them up to form con centrations of matter surrounded by vast cosmic voids. Philosophers were right: Nature d oes abhor a vacuum. Even empty space is seething with activity. It is the vacuum ener gy fluctuations which cause \"white noise\" in electronic circuits, an d limits the level to which signals can be amplified. Might this be the metaphysical basis of the audible life stream, the Sound, the Word in mysticism? * * * In an interview with Megabrain Report (1991) , Bearden has some interesting comments on the collective unconscious: \"Jung's collective unconscious, for example, consists of archetypal infolded EM structures acting in common in an overall bio-quantum-potential for th e entire species. Gaia, the living earth/biosphere, really does scientific ally exist as a common bio-quantum-potential with infolded living EM structures for the entire earth biosphere. The bio-potential in a single body is an overall quantum potential that links and joins all the atoms and cells of the body. The \"spirit\" of the biosystem, if you will, is its \"living biopotential\"--its living quant um potential. We already know that a potential is everywhere nonzero all the way out to infinity. So the spirit of the living system is--in the virtual s tate-- everywhere in the universe--and everywhen as well. It's all a giant hologram, not only in space, but in spacetime. The entire universe is everywhere alive, with everything. Note th at if you simply examine the \"ghost forms\" requirement of quantum mechanics, this conclusion is inescapable. All life is eternal. Nothing is ever lost. A thought or thoughtform is just a specific, dynamic Whittaker structure i n the hidden EM channels of the biopotential. Thoughts and thoughtforms are real. They are virtual spatially, but they occupy one \"real\" spacetime dimension, time. Physics and metaphysics share one common, nonobservable dimension: time. So long as physics continues to have to have time, which is nonobservable"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"a priori, then it also must contain everything that is a structure or action in time. With Whittaker EM engineering, you can conceivably \"make\" thoughtforms to order, and input them directly into the mind and longterm memory. If we vi ew the conscious mind as a special serial computer, we have now found where the software is--for mind, longterm memory, and personality. As scalar EM technology develops, we will have direct access to the software, so to speak, for the very first time. And we will be able to engineer it at will.\" PANTHEON PREFACE (1999): When I began my own study and practice of pathworking, it became readily apparent to me that there was much more to b e learned about godforms in Jungian literature than in all the Qabala and Magick books put together. But no one had been very comprehensive nor systematic about their presentations. Pantheon is a broad survey or study of the archetypes as discussed in the literature of Jungian Psychology. Typically, the Jungians di scuss archetypes by using the Greek godforms, since they are generally more famil iar from school days and considered more \"user-friendly\". But pantheons are a cr oss- cultural phenomena, so a table of correspondences is provided to translate in to other cultural pantheons. This is not neo-paganism. These gods and goddesses are not presented as objec ts of worship or veneration, but as universal autonomous forces with their own agen das which weave constantly through our outer and inner reality. They are relevant in daily life because they are the motivating factors behind our beliefs, t houghts, feelings, and behavior. We can hardly hope to be self-directing individuals w ithout some knowledge of their patterns and effects on our lives and souls. In thi s work, the correspondences of godforms to chapters is patterned after the Paths an d Tarot Trumps. A godform is corresponded with each Trump through astrological attributes. This makes Pantheon useful to students of Tarot, Qabala, astrol ogy, and Jungian thought. When I first wrote it in 1983, it was the first and only compilation of this mater ial in one convenient source. Since then, Jungian ideas became mainstream and several analysts and other Transpersonal Psychologists have offered many workshops and written excellent books on \"personal mythology.\" These include such emi nent personalities as Joseph Campbell, Jean Houston, Robert Bly, Jean Shinoda Bolin , and Stan Krippner to name just a few. Yet, this volume still has something un ique to offer with its workbook format, suggestions for further study, and the qabali stic spin. Myth has become an important core feature of modern spiritualit y.

We say and do things we never believed we wer e capable of, and then claim we \"must have been beside ourselves.\" Or, \" I wasn't myself .\" Our subconscious minds provoke us into behavior we would never consciousl y choose. Some of these are self-defeating or self-sabatoguing and come through our sh adow, while others let us glimpse that we are more creative, talented, or wise than we e ver thought possible. These gifts come from the transpersonal end of the spectr um. At first glance, each individual's problems, experiences, and innate qual ities seem unique. Yet, from another perspective, we all share the common inheritance of a my thic dimension of life, which psychologist Carl Jung termed the \"collective unconscious .\" We are walking compendiums of universal forces from which the details of our individu al stories flow. Every story is a unique version of universal themes, the infinite in the f inite. We are the very embodiment of universal themes of life, death, and rebirth. All of our human potential for both \"good\" and \"evil\" comes through this subc onscious source. It reveals itself through dreams, visions, art, fantasy, imagination, and myth s or tales in all cultures. These themes and myths contain a value far greater than their creative or literary merits. Not only do myths inform us of the origins of thought and ph ilosophy, they also reveal an ancient, sacred dimension of human experience. The realm of the collective unconscious is \"populated\" with mythical figures which are described as gods and goddesses. Each has a retinue of corresponding moods, lan dscapes, personality traits, preferences, etc. These figures personify man's qu alities or modes of being in the world. Each has particular characteristics. Knowledge of t hese characteristics or styles can enhance our personal journeys of self-discovery, and give us ins ight into our own motivations and choices. Through personally discovering these godforms within and without, we gain acc ess to a deeper understanding of both ourselves and others. We all share the jou rney of self- exploration, even though different aspects of it appear to each of us. Certain of t he gods and goddesses may play a major or dominant role in our lives and those of our loved ones , but our imagination or psyche contains them all. The more of these basic patter ns of life we have access to, the greater our experience of this mythic dimension of lif e which makes our conscious day-to-day lives even more meaningful. The point is not to consciou sly live one myth, or even one's myth, but to live mythically, in touch with that fabled di mension of experience. The realization of our purpose, path, or personal potential has often been cons idered a \"key\" to life's meaning. To realize the fullness of one's personality and to develop our native abilities and personal characteristics to the highest degree p ossible is a worthy long- range goal. This has been the orientation of the human potential movement, and t he personal goal of self-actualization, or self-realization...to experientially und erstand that, \" I am That. \" PANTHEON, as a manual of personal self-discovery, is a practical guide to recogni zing and realizing the origins and development of our individual characters and ch aracteristics."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"As such, it leads to a growth of self-knowledge, and gives us insight into the t raits and behaviors of our acquaintances and intimates. Pantheon provides not only background knowledge for reference, but also pract ical psychological technique which we can impliment in our journey toward un derstanding. One can gain access to the deeper psyche, soul, or imagination through both the rat ional and experiential methods. These are self-analysis and active imagination. Active imagination includes consciousness journeys deep into the psych e, identification, and internal dialogues with personified archetypes. It is the dialogic al method. This is a way of building experiential relationships with archetypal forces-- harmonizing with them, honoring them. These are \" as if\" real relationships, not taken literally. These internal dialogues can be useful, revealing the autonomous dynamics and agendas at work in our lives. They reveal things to us we know, but don't know we kno w. We can use many methods for this communication, such as journal work, hypnosis, or rit ual. These are moments where we create and enter sacred space. These relationships reveal the meaningfulness behind the many complications in our modern lives. The more we approach our individual wholeness, through expanding our awarene ss and experiences, the more we are likely to encounter these divine princ iples from the realm of imagination. This journey toward wholeness is easier to integrate into dai ly life with a psychological framework for containing and accomodating a wide range of images, emotions, moral views, styles of thought, beliefs, and even dress. When we know the characteristics of the various archetypes, we find the m relected back to our consciousness from the environment. We can learn to view their effe cts on our lives directly and gain in personal, social, and spiritual freedom. If we fail to bec ome consciousnely aware of their effects, their spontaneous activation may prod uce devastating effects on the personality. They can create internal divisions in the psyc he which may lead to the disintegration of personality. This can result in disease, self-d estructive behavior, or even culminate in death. As we mature into adults, many of us are forced by environmental factors to trave l roads which do not follow our natural predispositions. This may create confl icts or crises in our lives, which require either change or understanding. Some of us are forced , for example, to work in occupations which do not really suit our personalities. For some i t becomes a challenge to be met and accepted; others of us just feel like \"square pegs in round holes.\" Pantheon is designed to help us recognize and realize our talents and natur al predispositions. In this manner, many misplaced persons should be ab le to develop latent talents in areas where they could excel through natural aptitude, at the same time finding a sense of self-fulfillment on the job and in relationships. "},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION THE CONCEPT OF ARCHETYPES The work of Swiss psychologist Carl Jung (1875-1961) has become of greater and great er interest to the general public. His works or their summaries are part of almost every seeker's list of books to read. The growing interest in Jungian Psychology (or D epth Psychology) stems from the fact that it answers the needs of many people as a me ans for relating to \"internal\" as well as \"external\" reality. These people are seek ing a fuller understanding of the meaning of life in such areas as dreams, fantasy, compu lsive behaviors, and self-exploration or spiritual enrichment. The main focus of Jung's work stressed the search for meaning and the devel opment of individuation, psychological wholeness, or integrity of the personality. Jungi an therapy opened the door to the collective unconscious for many, not only to their subc onscious desires and motivations but also to their higher spiritual aspirations and potentials. Jungian psychology describes the meaning of symbols and events on the spirit ual quest for self-actualization in non-religious terms. It is extremely useful f or self-analysis. By gaining a working knowledge of the temperaments of our various facets and how they i nterrelate, an integration or synthesis of personality becomes possible. This results in high well-being and increased creativity. In practical terms, Jungian therapy includes developing awareness of int ernal guiding principles, or archetypes. You don't need a personal therapist to discover t hese archetypes within. We can discover them ourselves if we know what to look for during per iods of reflection or introspection. Knowing the patterns, they can strike us di rectly when we catch ourselves in the act of watching them act through us. An archetype is an innate, or in-born pattern, part of our hardwiring, which functions as the underlying matrix behind any event. They are not necessarily transmit ted through our genes, but they are fundamental to our method of perceiving nature, God, and man . They"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"are the very substance of our experience of life. They act like filters or l enses for our perception. Archetypes may be seen as embodiments of specific functions, and the ir characteristic patterns may be personified by giving each a name. In this way, we can learn to re cognize archetypes when they appear in our lives affecting styles of behavior, thought , emotions, attitudes, and dress. By personification, identifying and naming them, we can take up a meaningful relationship with these characters of our internal world . We gain the option of holding imaginal discussions with them about their attitudes, desire s, and opinions. The Jungian perspective sees the human perception of \"reality\" as origi nating in a projection from an internal motivating factor (or archetype) onto our environ ment. Since we do not perceive the universe of experience directly, but through th e filters of our senses, we experience archetypes through sight, touch, taste, smell, and sounds, and the metaphorical equivalent of these senses in our imaginal life. They also appear in human typology, and the various functions of feeling, sensation , intuition, and thinking. Because of their nature's we are introverted or extroverted, thinkers or feelers, knowers or doers. They are constantly maneuvering our hu man lives as if we were puppets. In the ancient past, when these powers of the arch etypes over the human will were intensely dramatic, or negative, this phenomenon was ter med \"possession,\" and it could be demonic or spiritual in nature. On a more common level, archetypes are constantly affecting our value judgemen ts, priorities, emotonal relationships, work situations, and daily life resp onses in the physical world in an unconscious way. Sometimes these appearances of archetypal patt erns are appropriate, in tune with conscious goals; but sometimes the archetypes seem to have a goal of their own, independent of (and perhaps self-destructive to) our personalistic ego desires. \"They\" don't seem to know or care what we want. How can we be self -directing when their influence is capricious and subconscious? Civilization is largely the result of mankin's conscious understanding a nd taming of primitive instinctual forces of the archetypes. With fewer and fewe r \"taboos\" to control our society, we need to understand our own emotional upheavals so that we aren' t overwhelmed by them. We can evolve to an understanding of our subtle and not-so -subtle inner urges, in which case they cease to compel us and begin to work on our behalf. Thus, we can grow out of counterproductive behaviors into the ability to actualize our higher goals. It is these underlying matrix patterns within the psyche which produ ce the outer behavior. When we can see that archetypes are motivating factors, it is also possible to i ntuit how a knowledge of their particular characteristics cold be useful in un derstanding the complexities of life. But, are these gods and goddesses real in the objective sense? Can they real ly manipulate our behavior so subbtely without us noticing them? According to Jung this is t rue, and we all share this condition. Even those trained in these areas maintain psyc hological \"blind spots\" where we fail to see the archetypes moving us."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Jung saw man, not as an isolated individual, but as being linked with the whol e of mankind (and mankind's abilities) through the collective unconscious. This u nconscious manifests in the multiple forms of gods and goddesses. These figures take differen t, though analogous forms in the various mythologies of the world's cultures. Thus the goddesses Isis (Egyptian), Artemis (Greek), and Diana (Roman) al l share a common essence and use the same lunar symbolism. The same generic form is also behind the Catholic's Blessed Virgin Mary, and all are derived from the theme of C elestial Queen. These forms, or archetypes, should not be thought of as nouns (things), bu t rather as semantic metaphors. They represent powers or qualities, but when we personify them it is \"as if\" we take up a relationship with another entity. They assume an ant hropomorphic form in imagination in order to make a dialogue easier. This dialogical exchange i s just a variation of the I-Thou communications of mysticism. Ancient Uranus, heaven's Titan of old, Gelded by Chronos with one stroke so bold. CHAPTER 0: THE FOOL URANUS Uranus characterizes the original evolutionary impulse -- the mystic g randfather of all existence. The story of Uranus is rooted in the Greek Creation Myth. It s peaks to"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"us from the remote depths of the unknown, before the birth of human consciousness. It represents an aspect of the universe which appeared before space and time (Cronos). Zero is pure unmanifest potential, even prior to the or iginal impulse. Its psychic equivalent is superconsciousness. In the Tarot, this trump is numbered 0, and alternately 22, implying it is nothi ng and everything. All matter plus gravity in the observable universe equals zero. S o the universe could come from nothing because it is, fundamentally nothi ng (Guth, 2002). In the Vedas, all creation is considered mindstuff -- an illusion of being. Return to the primordial vacuum, a boiling stew from which pairs of positi ve and negative subatomic particles bubble into being for the briefest of ins tants. Inflationary theory suggests that what erupted was a \"false vacuum,\" a peculiar form of matter predicted to exist by many particle theorists. It is chara cterized by a repulsive gravitational field, one so strong it can explode into a universe. The false vacuum does not \"thin out\" during expansion; rather, its densit y remains constant even as it grows, creating vast quantities of ever-doubling energy, whic h decayed into a seething plasma of particles such as electrons, positrons and neutrinos. This hot soup neutralized to form simple atoms 300,000 years later. T he simple atoms, like hydrogen, helium, and lithium, were ripped apart and cr ushed together to form more complex, heavier atoms insisde stars. Exploded into s pace by supernovas, they became the matter we see--and are--today. In terms of personal experience Uranus represents experiences fro m conception through growth in the womb (space/time) and emergence into independe nt existence. It is pre-conceptual consciousness, pure creative consciou sness emerging from the fount of Chaos . Uranus is a god of the starry heavens, and was not the first force to appear in the Universe. According to this classical myth, only Chaos existed in the beginning. The seemingly random element produced Gaea, the deep-breasted earth or matter, from within infinite potential. For matter to exist, the force of attraction also had to appear (super-celestial Eros). Uranus, the starry heavens, is Gaea's first -born child. In other words, the first descent of matter into the threshold of concr ete existence came from a chaotic matrix, the virtual vacuum fluctuation. This cosmic t rinity of chaos, matter, and attraction lies at the heart of modern chaos theory. It bears directly on another Greek archetype that we all share--the psyche. Scientists have found that the principle of underlying chaos determin istically conditions many of the patterns of physical existence. Chaos is found in our brainwaves, heartbeats, the fractal structure of our breathing, circulatory, d igestive, and nervous systems. We see chaos in all natural processes from the weathe r to evolution. And the turbulence in our lives reminds us that \"we are that .\" Just as the ancient pantheon provided a foundational orientation for the Gre eks, so chaos theory can provide us with a model of consciousness for constructing cogn itive maps of the psyche and experiential consciousness journeys. Uranus-cons ciousness"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"is experienced as drifting and floating in vast expanses of starry space, or identification with galaxies from the barely formative stage to full sp irals, and feeling that spirally motion until letting go to primordial chaos. By embracing the chaos in our lives--learning to re-honor the principle- -we can begin balancing out millennia of identification which held that onl y order equates with \"good.\" Part of our cultural heritage is the programming that we should stave off chaos and disruption at every point. But the continual dynamic interp lay of chaos and order is fundamental to our well-being. Embracing that in the here and now is the foundation of our existential situation, and conditions us in te rms of faith and trust, worry or freedom from fear. Uranus represents deep subconscious forces which operate well be low the normal state of awareness. It is nonlinear, free consciousness which emerges in unexpected, bizarre ways like dreams and intuitions when the ego is asleep or preoc cupied. In terms of states of consciousness, it is cosmic consciousness, a non-ordinar y perception of oneness with deep space and identification with all cre ation -- past, present and future. Uranus is the first patterning of matter once it emerges from total c haos. In embryonic development it means the stage from conception to that where all cells are still completely undifferentiated and full of all potential. The re is no brain development, so the experience is totally raw, impressionistic and visce ral. Sometimes it is psychologically more fruitful to \"let go\" of control, pass thr ough the chaotic de-structured state, and discover what happens on the other sid e. Chaos is definitely part of the process of creation and creativity. It generates the new order spontaneously from deep within itself. What makes it imperative for us to embrace the new scientific paradigm i mplied by chaos theory? By rejecting chaos, we reject Gaea. And she is not only the Earth, t he love of the planet, the integrity of life forms, but all matter in the univers e including your own physical body. Returning to these deep states of consciousness, t he well- springs of our being, fosters a new kind of love of our own physical embodim ent. This new image of self arises from the most primordial level. Whatever the essence of chaos is, we are that. By rejecting it, we run the danger of rejecting our selves. Chaos is the essence of life. Chaos is essential to he alth. Chaos describes the structural growth patterns in nature. Chaos theory leads t o a new vision of matter, one no longer passive, but one associated with spontaneous, creative, nonlinear activity, and a healing state of consciousness. PHYSICAL FORM We repeat the creation myth when we are conceived as living beings from the raw material of atomic substance in interaction with the universal consci ousness field.

We might all be said to be gin in this primordial condition in the womb, where we are united with the oce an of the subconscious, or primal mothering principle. When awareness first deve lops, it is on a grossly material level. All signals come from the physical body, with no awar eness of \"out there,\" the world of space and time. As we grow older, signals still come to us through our bodies, materializing i n the form of psychosomatic disorders. These come to us through Uranus who fathe red our prototypical instincts in an incestuous union with his mother Gaea. The birth of the children of this pair, the Titans, marked a golden age for mankind's awar eness. The age of the Titans meant that mankind lived in harmony with his instin ctual nature, since he had no awareness to set up a conflicting point of view. The re was no dichotomy. The Titans were the forerunners of astrological signs of the Zodiac and inc luded Theia, Rhea, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys, Themis, Oceanus, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and Cronos, plus assorted monsters. But, Uranus, had a curious relationship to his offspring and sought to repress their appearance. Hi s method was to push them back into their mother, or imprison them in matter. This repression of instinctual energies seeking a form in matter re sults in a blockage or obstacle which manifests as a psychosomatic disorder. That which cannot achieve spiritual birth is condemned to manifest in matter, since it can ach ieve consciousness no other way. The repressed instinct confronts the huma n awareness in such disorders as asthma, allergies, and colitis. No wonder the body gets indigestion from these \"children\" being shoved back down its thr oat. The body is forced into hysterical over-reaction and peculiar immune system respon se. Uranus represses his own power of creativity, or at least its manifestati ons. The result is the seeds of rebellion sprout in a plot between Gaea and Cron os. Time and materiality conspire to limit the domain of Uranus. The genetic patter n is continuing to unfold and more and more structure develops in the fetus . Over time, corporality creates a more developed central nervous system which develops qualitatively different perceptions from the undifferentiated organ ism. When Cronos or Saturn solidifies as the ego, the Uranus consciousness is recalle d as a pre- egoic state of intimate identification, undifferentiation. Cronos castrates his devouring father, emasculating him and freeing his sib lings. Archetypal patterns repeat themselves over and over. Archetypes functi on in the psyche like the magnetic strange attractors of chaos theory. They are the cente r around which certain patterns gravitate.

When we engage in self-defeating, self-sabatoging efforts that ni p our creativity in the bud, we are acting like Uranus.

In the Newsweek article, the neuromagnetics research of neuropsychologist Dr. Michael Persinger is given a cursory review in regard to Temporal Lobe Trans ients (TLTs) which are implicated as miniseizures in producing a variety of perceptual anomolies combined with a sense of deep meaning. Persinger identifies the temporal lobes as the biological basis of the God Experience, \"the God Module,\" in his 1987 book Neuropsychological Bases of God Beliefs. He comments on the purpose of his research: \"As a human being, I am concerned about the illusionary explanations for human consciousness and the future of human existence. Consequently after wr iting [NBGB], I began the systematic application of complex electromagnetic fields to disce rn the patterns that will induce experiences (sensed presence) that are att ributed to the myriad of ego-alien intrusions which range from gods to aliens. The research is not t o demean anyone's religious/mystical experience but instead to determine which po rtions of the brain or its electromagnetic patterns generate the experience. Two thousand y ears of philosophy have taught us that attempting to prove or disprove realities may ne ver have discrete verbal (linguistic) solutions because of the limitation of thi s measurement. The research has been encouraged by the historical fact that most wars and group degradations are coupled implicitly to god beliefs and to the presumption that those who do not believe the same as the experient are somehow less human and hence expendable. Although these egocentric propensities may have had adaptive significance, their utility for the species' future may be questionabl e.\" His technique, using solenoids in a helmet for input, is fairly simpl e. A hand-held computer programs the predefined pattern at which the fields w ill fluctuate. The impulses move through the temporal lobe and penetrate deep into the br ain, where they interfere and interact with the complex electrical patterns of the subject's neural fields. The new patterns spread through the limbic system, p roducing sensations that range from subtle to profound. Persinger's research goal is to use his device to trigger transcendental experiences in nonreligious people fac ed with the fear of death. Persinger has tickled the temporal lobes of around a 1000 people and has conclu ded, among other things, that different subjects label this ghostly percepti on with the names that their cultures have trained them to use -- Elijah, Jesus, th e Virgin Mary, Mohammed, the Sky Spirit. Some subjects have emerged with Freudian interpretations - describing the presence as one's grandfather, for in stance - while"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"others, agnostics with more than a passing faith in UFOs, tell something th at sounds more like a standard alien-abduction story. Persinger has discovered that when he aims for the amygdala, his subjects experience sexual arousal. When he focuses the solenoids on the right hemi sphere of their temporal lobes, they sense on the left side of their body a negative pre sence -- an alien or a devil, say. When he switches to left left hemisphere, his subj ects sense a benevolent force: an angel or a god. Focused on the hippocampus, the personal electromagnetic relaxation de vice will produce the sort of opiate effects that Ecstasy does today. So far, subjects rep ort no adverse side effects. However, \"if you interfere with the opiate pattern, people get very irritated,\" Persinger says. In fact, \"they'll actually cuss you out.\" Persinger asserts that, \" God Experiences are products of the human brain. When certain portions of the brain are stimulated, God Experiences, tempered by the per son's learning history, are evoked. They appear to have emerged within the human spec ies as a means of dealing with the expanded capacity to anticipate aversive events. God Experiences contain common themes of \"knowing,\" forced thinking, inner voic es, familiarity, and sensations of uplifting movements. \" God Concepts are determined by verbal conditioning; perceptions are constructions. When multiple eve nts occur within a week, they are usually given special labels, such as \"revelations,\" \"communions,\" or \"conversions.\" People with TLTs experience vivid landscapes or perceive forms of livin g things. Some of these entities are not humans, but are described as little men, glowing forms, or bright, shining sources. The modality of the experience, that is, wh ether it is experienced as a sound, a smell, a scene (vision), or an intense feeling, re flects the area of the electrical instability. The experiences, whether visual or aud itory, may have actually happened or they may be mixtures of fantasy and reality. Sometimes they may be fixed in space and time, while in other cases they may be as dyn amic as everyday experiences. However, whether they are dreamlike or vivid, they are experienced as real. Persinger is not saying that the experiences of God are synonymous with temp oral lobe epilepsy. However, when vast depolarizing waves spread across millions of cells, all types of memories and fantasies are mixed and mashed together. But the God Experience is a normal and more organized pattern of temporal lobe activity, precipitated by subtle psychological factors such as personal stress, loss , and anticipated death. The gut feeling is a sense of familiarity, deep meaning, conviction and import ance, even euphoria or mania (alternately fear and terror). The brain's chemical r eaction is to release natural opiates and other mood elevating neurotransmitters. Du ring TLTs, the person peers into another realm which has many names, heaven, the world of spirits, or the other dimension. Trained meditators, (employing r hythmic stimulus to the CNS such as a mantra or \"emptying\", changes in oxygen and blood"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"sugar levels), can drive the temporal lobe into bouts of theta activity. Sometim es frank electrical seizures occur and the God Experience is reported. Neuroscientist Todd Murphy, www.jps.net/brainsci/, has done a good job of summarizing Persinger's research in simpler language. He describe s consciousness as a feedback interface of sensory and cognitive modalities. Low intensity m agnetic fields orchestrate communication between lobes of the brain, at a spee d much faster than the bioelectrical or biochemical process of neurons. Different si gnals produce different phenomena. The temporal lobes are the parts of the brain that mediate states of consciousness. Multiple modalities are experienced simultaneously, with the imp lication that they are 'reset' all at once by neuromagnetic signals which come in pairs, runni ng slightly out of phase with one another. In this way, neuromagnetic signals, like the t wo laser beams used to produce a hologram, might be able to store information. The spee ds at which neuromagnetic signals are propagated and their capacity to recruit/al ter multiple modalities suggests that they were naturally selected to mak e instant choices to alter states of consciousness, and to do so quickly to facilitate adap tive behavior. Murphy's many articles include not only the production of consciousness and states of consciousness, the God experience, but deja vu, and the spiritual per sonality. Long-term memory is seated in the surface of the bottom of the temporal l obes in the para hippocampal cortex, closely connected to the hippocampus. Usually, the re is seamless integration of past, present and future. We experience so mething in the present, compare it to the past and decide how to respond in a few second s. But once in a while, in Deja Vu, there is too much communication between short- term and long-term memories. Then the present can feel like the pas t. If present perceptions are shunted through the brain areas that process memories from the past, those perceptions feel like memories, and we feel we are re-li ving a moment stored in long-term memory. The opposite happens in Jamais Vu : things seem totally unfamily because of too little connection between long-term memory and perceptions from the present. Nothing we experience seems to have anything to do with the past. If these experiences spill over into the amygdala they are highly emotional. If goes to the right it is unpleasant or fearful, to the left from ecstatic to beautifi c. Another experiential phenomenon is time distortion. Murphy describes the phenomenon of the Sensed Presence and how it e merges from out of phase processes in different hemispheres of the brain. He also re lates the sensed presence with the behavior and feelings of romantic love. The 'self' is what we experience when a specific pattern of brain act ivity is happening. It is linked to the Forty Hertz Component which appears fr om the temporal lobes, and two of it's deeper structures, the amygdala and the hippocampus. The 40 Hz signal is only not there in dreamless sleep. The"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"maintenance of the sense of self is repeated 40 times per second and each t ime it can manifest a new emotional response to changing circumstances every 25 mill iseconds. These structures on both sides of the brain yield two 'selves,' two sens es of self. One is on the left, and one on the right, but they are not equals. The left-sided sense of self is dominant in most people; right side subordinatenon-verbal, int rospective. The left is the one where language happens, maintaining our stream of inner words and thoughts about everything we experience or can imagine. Each normal brain function involes a primary operative area on one side with a subordinate homologous or corresponding area on the other. On the other side of the brain, following the rule that each thing on one side of the brain does the opposite of what the same thing on the other side does, we get the conclusi on that there is a non-linguistic sense of self on the right side of the brain. U sually the two selves work in tandem. But if the two fall out of phase, and the left-sided self manifests by itself, we experience our own, right-sided silent sense of self coming out where the left sided sense of self experiences it as \"other,\" as not-s elf. This leads to the phenomenon of Sensed Presence, actually the Silent Self. Electrical activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and temporal can 'spill over' i nto nearby structures. If it ignites the visual area, intense visions of an ent ity of some sort emerge (left amygdala-positive imagery; right side-negative images/en tities). Kindling the olfactory region leads to unique scents; the somatosensory s timulation leads to buzzing, energetic, or tingly sensations or perceptions of being li fted or floating; language center activation produces coices, music or noise; long -term memory (lower portion of temporal lobes) access yields interactive virtu al realities, complete with emotions, much like waking dreams. The thalamus is imp licated in aura vision, and the reticular activating system in life reviews. Because positive thoughts (involving the right hippocampus), and positive fe elings (involving the left amygdala) are on opposite sides of the brain, prayer or meditat ion changes the balance of activity on the two sides. These structures have som e of the lowest firing thresholds in the brain and are thus likely to mismatch th eir metabolic rates of activity. Whenever that's happening, chances of the activity of the two si des falling out of phase with each other increases. Then the 'right self' is experienced as an external presence. Sensed presence experiences become more common until the day arr ives when God's presence is something the person feels at all times. In mysti cal experience language fails, and a person's sense of themselves can be transformed. Sinc e we can't experience two senses of self, one is projected as other, the Be loved, either romantic or spiritual. There is thus some truth to the saying that the be loved is God, and that when we love God we are loving ourselves. I and Thou are One. The other becomes the Self. Some of the paradoxical nature of Uranus is conveyed by his occupations:"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"ancestor astrologer astronomer cosmologist electrician grandfather godfather humanitarian hypochondriac inventor metaphysician revolutionary X-ray technician EMOTIONAL IMAGE There is an interesting expression of the paradoxical nature of the wholene ss or unity of consciousness represented by Uranus in our modern culture. The cosmological Uranus is a malicious, ferocious power who thwarts even his own progress. This picture of conservatism is directly opposed by the image we find of Uranus in modern astrology. Since Uranus was only discovered in 1781, it has no ancient Chaldean astrological tradition like the bodies lying within the \"ring pass not\" of Saturn. When we look to the astrological descriptors of Uranus, we don't find a model of conservatism, but just the opposite. Here Uranus is the random element or creative innovation, as well as erraticism and rebellion. Uranus reveals the underl ying matrix of Chaos at work in the universe. It is a structure-annihilating for ce. It shows while spirit is still working through material conditions it is com pletely controlled by the mind. Uranus is the great synthesizer of the various aspects of intel ligence symbolized by all the planets and weaves them into a synthetic whole, and fr om that comes the fully individualized human, the complete person, the mas ter. This paradox of building and annihilating forces embodies the fight agains t one's self, symbolized by the eternal battle between youth and old age, the generati on gap. The polarity of this situation stems from the different archetypes motivating the participants. Youth resolves to live in a liberal manner, different from t he traditional collective values of the ancestor, and the battle is on! The \"old guard\" would like to control and direct the youth into fitting into his world, bu t the youth would create a unique future development of his own. In our life experiences, we are sometimes the youth and sometimes th e conformist, the liberal or conservative. Our position at any given time is relative to our s ocial position, age, and relationships. Those locked in the Uranus perspective ar e unconscious of their attitude and lack any self-awareness or psychological insight. This yields an unconscious identification with herd instinct or group consciousness, with no room for individuality."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"When we move into structure, we tend to become more and more rigid, the p atterns become more fixed. This order is self-generated from chaos, but when i t becomes too rigid, the process moves toward chaos once again--death, decay, total de- structuring. It happens on the physical level to our bodies, to our emotions in our ups and downs, in the creation and destruction of our thoughts, and in the transformations within our belief systems. We embrace and identify w ith a pattern which emerges from the creative chaos, but eventually we must sacrifi ce it, let it go-- for no pattern is our true essence.

As the projections of our instinctual or archetypal natures are gradually re cognized and assimilated, the character of an individual's relation to the world un dergoes a profound alteration.

It means part of oneself is \"projected\" into, or becomes invested in something other than oneself. The identification is pre- conditioned by the primal self image and subsequent experiences. Uranus creates some bizarre twists in participation mystique. For example, the third-world wife of an \"UFO abductee\" began to have her own confirming experiences. Simply put she had two choices--to reject him and his rep orts or join in. At the end of a prior marriage, having no skills, she was forced to stay over a year with her ex-husband because of financial and dependency issues. Stil l in the same boat, her subconscious colluded in providing her with common bizarre UF O experiences with her husband. They live in an isolated world with no identifiable boundaries or sanctuary; it is just the two of them against the disbelievin g world and the unknown, invasive, violating force. In a more mundane, yet typical example, a couple of lovers involved in this level would allow one another to symbolize their unlived aspects of life (contr asexual side), instead of developing a consciousness which perceives all indivi duals as having both male and female qualities.

Not due to medical, neurological or substanc e- induced disorder Excerp from The Modern Alchemist , by Miller and Miller: Your identification with objects, your roles, other people, and your possession s may border on what is known as participation mystique. It is a way of being involved with externals to the point where they seem to exert a magical effect over you. If you use people or objects to mood-alter yourself, they possess you, and you can't possibly rel ate to rationally. You have literally invested your energy in something othe r than yourself...and have given a piece of yourself away. Mutual projections by lovers can result in all sorts of folly and shared delusi ons. Frequently people fall in love with those who have traits they would like to ac tualize in themselves. Instead of manifesting that, we let the other carry those qu alities and try to patch the hole in our wholeness. This counter-projection can result in the syndrome of folie a deux, or the \"madness of two.\" This accounts for the \"just us against the world\" mentality. Any psychological deviation of one is condoned and reinforced i n the other in a spiraling move away from consensus reality into isolation.

Mutual projection is also the basis of personality cults, but the roles are sim ply switched to teacher and disciple as Platonic lovers. There is an unconscious fascination, an enchantment, which comes from seeing yourself refl ected in your beloved, whether it is true or not. Another example of this fascination or participation mystique is the cre ation of talismans. Talismans are objects you invest with seemingly magical powers to influence a situation. This is the basis of sympathetic magic. It account s for the recent fad of using crystals as healing stones. It is fine if you use them to focus your creative imagination, but don't mistake the fact that it is your own investm ent of energy that brings the transformations rather than any inherent quality in t he crystal. Belief systems perpetuate a mystery feeling that can lead to illu sory convictions about the way things work. When not of pathological character, shared folies still happen to us and are cal led \"participation mystique\" in Jungian psychology. They are the product of psyc hic contagion and when they are positive are the basis of the placebo effect, fait h healings, shamanic healing, and psychotherepeutic healing. There is an unconscious fascination which comes from seeing oneself re flected in the \"other,\" whether the other contains this quality or not. It appears to contain it when we are under the influence of participation mystique. Another exampl e is investing an object with \"magical\" powers to influence a situation, like a love charm or talisman. This type of thinking perpetuates an illusory conviction concern ing \"the ways things are.\" As this fascination dissolves, the individual's attitudes and reacti ons to situations becomes freer and more objective. The projected contents \"return \" to their proper home in the psyche, and are realized on a conscious level. They are perceived as psychological reality, instead of physical reality. We are no longer at the mercy of the actions and moods of another person or the environment. The source of feeli ngs is known to exist within ourselves. Participation mystique is the ori ginal unconscious condition of psychological ignorance. The gods and demons in Jung's writings were not regarded as psychic proje ctions of the unconscious, but as self-evident realities. In the Age of Enlighten ment people \"discovered\" that the gods did not really exist, but were simply projecti ons of our unconsciousness. Thus, they were promptly dismissed as lacking rel igious value, and deposed from their thrones. But the corresponding psychological function was by no means ended by this over- rational analytical rejection. It was Uranus rejecting the children once agai n.

Our conscious awareness can assimilate, understand and elaborate its relat ionship to projections of the unconscious contents. It can come to know various autonomous portions of the psyche as personified archetypes. All the archetypes are the generations of the primordial ancestor Uranus. All patterns come from th e archetype of patterns descended from matter. These personification s appear as guides, demons, gods or goddesses, etc. Failure to voluntarily acknowledge them may result in consciousness bei ng overwhelmed by a somatic reaction or disturbance of the body. Or mental illn ess and disorientation may be the result of a flood of unconscious psychic conte nts. Personification helps the conscious ego create a dialogue with these in ner beings. It is the multiple consciousness form of I-Thou dialogue. We experience the m as \"Other\" or \"Not-I\". Yet, they are a part of ourselves. These dynamic mythologic al images, when neglected, may lead to psychosis or physical death in extreme case s. They are psychological and behavioral imperatives. Taking up a conscious relationship with them leads one out of the unconsc ious pitfalls of the original condition of participation mystique, where th eir influence is unduly exaggerated.

Tarnas, Spring Pub., Dallas, 1983. SPIRITUAL MYTH Uranus is a variation on the theme of \"Sky Father,\" and shares this in common with Cronos and Zeus who are his descendants. As a sky father, he represents a sp iritual impulse. The Greek creation myth shows the negative issuing into manife station reflecting the Spirit in search of experience. Chaos, the gaping maw of open space is a pure cosmic principle which has no god- form. Gaea, on the other hand, was represented as a primal woman of gigantic proportions. Uranus had no cult in Greece, even though Uranus and Gaea are considered the grandparents of the world. Uranus certainly wasn't a benevol ent parent, perhaps indicating that the original spiritual impulse was relu ctant to manifest at all, and didn't seem to like the idea of regeneration. Its tend ency was to remain abstract, but its method of repressing itself created a reactiona ry revolutionary, which Uranus self-generated from his own pattern."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"This revolution created the dimension of the experience of space and tim e, with several of its concomitant qualities, including absolute justice or k arma, also termed natural consequences. This is known as the law of action and reaction, or thermodynamics. This furious expression of Cronos is not tempered by Mer cy until the appearance of his offspring Zeus. Thermodynamics (Cronos) and matter (Gaea) led to the manifest univ erse. Gaea also created the first race of gods, and gave birth to the first human. She contai ned within herself the gift of foretelling the future. She contains all t he potentiality for manifestation, as is therefore a prophetess. Also she is the guardian of th e sanctity of oaths, including the marriage oath. This is another arc of the relationship amon g polar opposites. The spiritual myth which exemplifies the cosmological nature of Uranus i s that of the ANCIENT OF DAYS. There are a few variations of form for this cosmic m an, depending on the level of functioning in the creation. It has different names on different planes. The Most Ancient One, or Ancient of the Ancients c reates and produces the essence of light (Zeus). This primordial Being, also kn own as the Vast or Great Countenance gives birth to the Lesser Countenance or primordi al Man. The image is one of the Father of All Things, the Sacred Ancestor, \"The Whit e Head.\" In the Hebrew text THE ZOHAR describes the ancient one as wearing white robes. His face is vast, luminous, and terrible. He sits on a throne of flaming light. Th e white light streaming from His face illumines four hundred thousand worlds. Thirteen thousand myriads of worlds come into light from His skull, wh ich emanates a mysterious dew that has the power to awaken the spiritual de ad into everlasting life. This \"Great Face\" or \"Long Face\" is that of the Aged of A ged who has been before the beginning. He generates the \"Short Face\" which is th is Creation. The hair and beard of this Ancient of Ancients extends to the utterm ost parts of the universe. From His skull hang down a thousand myriad worlds, seven thousand and five hundred curling hairs which are not mingled lest confusion exist . In each curl are four hundred and ten locks of hair and these hairs radiate into four hun dred and ten worlds. In the hollow of His skull is the supreme hidden Wisd om. His brain extends by the thirty-two paths of the Tree of Life. Thirteen fountains flow forth from His beard. His hands pour out the Mother and Father rays. As the Ancient of Days, God issues from his concealment. The abyss of Deity is the body of Macroprosopus which gives birth to Microprosopus, the god-image in man. In the Qabala, the primal sphere Kether emanates forth from the vast ocean of spirit. Kether is called the which is Limitless Light Which is Not and also the Fiery Darkness . Kether is also identified as Ain , Nothingness -- the Absolute No-Thing and root of Every-thing.

He is the cosmic counterpart of the livi ng Earth, Gaea. Gaea could be corresponded with the theory of the universal dispers ion of life by micro-organisms ubiquitous in deep space, Panspermia. This is not to say t hat these theories will weather scientific scrutiny, but that they are ar chetypal in content and context. Our basic argument starts with a few very simple assumptions. We believe t hat anyone who accepts that the universe is \"fine-tuned\" for life would f ind it difficult not to accept these assumptions. But fine-tuning does not necessarily i mply intelligence, consciousness nor divine intentionality behind it. Th ey are: a) Our universe exists and contains life. b) Our universe is \"life friendly,\" that is, the conditions in our u niverse (such as physical laws, etc.) permit or are compatible with life existing natu ralistically. c) Life cannot exist in a universe that is governed solely by naturalistic law u nless that universe is \"life-friendly.\" The Archetype of the Anthropos still exerts such an influence on moder n thought that it has been formalized in cosmology as the Anthropic Principle, even though there are numerous scientific arguments and theories against this per sistent notion. anthropic arguments of this type have an honourable history from the 19th cent ury, when the Earth could not be dated directly. Our discussion of cosmology so far has leaned heavily on the Copernican princi ple that we are not privileged observers of the universe. However, there are so me aspects of the subject for which this principle has to be discarded ; as in quantum mechanics, we have to ask whether the mere presence of an observer influ ences the system under study. At first sight, it may seem absurd to think of humanity influencing in any w ay the global properties of the universe, but the simple fact of our existence doe s turn out to have profound consequences. These ideas are given the label ``anthropic' ', and we speak of the anthropic principle when discussing the universe in t he context of the existence of observers. However, this is an area that generates controversy, and not everyone will agree on the degree of importance of anthropic ideas. See Barrow & Tipler (1986) for a thorough review of the subject. Like religious schisms, the anthropic dogma comes in varying forms and degre es of elaboration. We can distinguish perhaps three sets of attitudes to anthrop ic reasoning: trivial, weak and strong anthropic principles. Here are some def initions, first from Barrow and Tipler: Weak Anthropic Principle (WAP): The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restri cted"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the Universe be old enough for it to have already done s o.

Because: 1.There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generat ing and sustaining 'observers'. Or... 2.Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being (Wheeler's Par ticipatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)). Or... 3.An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the exist ence of our Universe (which may be related to the Many-Worlds interpretation of quan tum mechanics). Final Anthropic Principle (FAP): Intelligent information-proces sing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will ne ver die out. It appears as though we live in a special universe. Some quantities seem to b e highly improbable values, for example, the flatness of the Universe is disturb ing. Note that if some of the finely-balanced quantities were not finely-tuned then our Universe would have grossly different properties. The properties would in fact b e so different that it is highly likely that life (as we know it) would not develop and be around to ask the question of why the Universe is special. That is, selection ef fects would say that it is only in universes where the conditions are right for life (th us pre-selecting certain universe) is it possible for the questions of specialness to b e posed. This statement and variants of this statement are the gist of the Anthrop ic Principle. Note that the Anthropic Principle is probably true and says that there i s nothing mysterious about why our Universe is special. However, it does not rule out th e possibility that there is a deeper level to our understanding of the Uni verse which makes our Universe the most probable universe from the plethora of all poss ible universes. This still may be true but is not required philosophicall y or scientifically. One of the most startling developments to come from modern physics is t hat the universe, in some very fundamental way, seems to have been \"designed\" or \"tun ed\" to produce life and consciousness. Actually, what physicists have discover ed is that there are a large number of \"coincidences\" inherent in the fundament al laws and constants of nature. Every one of these coincidences or specific relati onships between fundamental physical parameters is needed, or the evolution of l ife and consciousness as we know it could not have happened. The collection of th ese coincidences is an undisputed fact, and collectively, have come to be know n as the \"Anthropic Principle.\" An excellent and complete analysis and of this principle, its histori cal background, the physical evidence for its acceptance, and resulting implications ar e provided in the The Anthropic Cosmological Principle by John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler (Oxford University Press). In the introduction they state, \"Most pertu rbations of the"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"fundamental constants of Nature away from their actual numerical values lead to model worlds that are still-born, unable to generate observers and becom e cognizable. Usually, they allow neither nuclei, atoms nor stars to exist\" (p age 20). And from an earlier paragraph supporting the same point they cite P. Davies and M. Rees, \"For example, if the relative strengths of the nuclear and elec tromagnetic forces were to be slightly different then carbon atoms could not exist in Nature (Davies) and human physicists would not have evolved. Likewise, many of the global properties of the Universe, for instance the ratio of the number of photons to protons (Rees), must be found to lie within a very narrow range if cosmic con ditions are to allow carbon-based life to arise\" (page 5). The barest statement of this fact is called the Weak Anthropic Princip le (WAP), and essentially states that since we are here, the universe must have the properties, or coincidences, such that we could evolve. Although unquestioned and usefu l for making predictions about various aspects of the universe, the WAP offers no in sight as to WHY the universe is this way. Some, based on their interpretation of qu antum mechanics see a predominant role for the observer, and have gone so far as to suggest that observers are needed to bring the universe into existence. T his version of the AP is called the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP). There are obviously some issues here that would have to be explained because the universe got along just fine before we came to exist, and also does so in areas wher e we can't make any observations. Others, seeking a more substantial answer to wh y, have gone on to postulate the Strong Anthropic Principle (SAP), which stat es that in order for the universe to exist at all, it is somehow necessary for it to have thes e special properties. In other words, the universe must have been \"constr ucted\" this way, and could not have come into existence any other way. The Final Anthropic Principle (FAP) goes a step beyond the SAP and says that not only MUST life com e into existence, but once it does, it will last forever. Using the notion that energy can transform between radiation and matter, we can consider that consciousness may itself be another form of energy that has em erged through evolution. Conversely, the energy of the universe could have been completely in the form of consciousness priori to transforming into rad iation and matter in the early universe. Joe and Dan Provenzano call this idea the \"Holi stic Anthropic Principle\" (HAP). Of course, the broken vase (reminiscent of the qabalistic \"breaking of the vessels\") is only an analogy and proves nothing about the universe in general. However, it is a thought worth pursing. Perhaps consciousness is another \"higher,\" more or dered form or state of energy, and suppose that the Big Bang was a \"shattering\" or \"fragmenting\" of energy in this higher state. Then the inherent propert ies of matter and energy which allow life and consciousness to appear are fundamental as remnants of a previous existence in an earlier state. Viewed in this light , we get a completely new insight into the why question by explaining how the u niverse could have come into being with the tendency to produce life and consciousness ."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Furthermore, when you consider that, in general, it is very difficult to rec over much of an original completeness or beauty when something shatters, the HAP e ven sheds some light on why we would expect consciousness to be so rare, vulnerable an d subject to so many problems (or evils). None of the other versions of the AP sheds light on all of these aspects. Incidentally, the idea that we are somehow th e result of a \"playfulness,\" an \"experiment,\" or even a \"fall\" from God and/or the sp iritual world, and that we are groping to find our way back is an ancient and common idea to both Eastern and Western religions. There are many theories in cosmology competing with even the most plausibl e Anthropic Principle. One of the newest competing theories is that of gr avastars, which arguably replace the notion of blackholes, deep wells of cosmic not hingness. Black holes were first conceived in the early 1900s, long before the discovery of quantum physics, a revolutionary scientific field that describes the nature of many fundamental particles and forces. The first black hole proponents were ignorant of quantum fluctuations in the universe that affect everything from light partic les to gravity, Mottola and Maz ur observed. \"We are usually not aware of the quantum medium we are immersed i n,\" Mottola writes in New Scientist, \"like a fish in a calm pond who is not awar e of all the incessant jiggling of water molecules.\" Without quantum mechanic s, the early theorists made crucial mistakes in envisioning black holes and their relationship with space and time, the two say. As a consequence, astronomers have been for ced to face bizarre paradoxes spawned by black hole theory. For example, light photons would gain an infinite amount of energy when the y reach an event horizon, according to classical theorists. But they ignore the gravitational effects of this unthinkable amount of energy. Mottola and Mazur th ink they have a better explanation for what happens to a collapsing star. Before a blac k hole could form, quantum effects would change space-time around an implod ing giant, kicking off a radical phase transition akin to when liquid water bec omes ice. The shift to a new state would lead to the formation of an exotic new object, t he gravastar, a condensed bubble enveloped by a thin spherical shell of gravitation al energy. In a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters, Mottola and Mazur argue th at gravastars are consistent with classical laws of physics but do not have embarrassing inconsistencies as do black holes. Moreover, from Earth, they w ould appear much the same as classical black holes. Therefore, those chaotic d ense hot spots throughout the universe that astronomers consider indirect proof of black holes could just as well support the existence of gravastars, they say. Mottol a and Mazur hope the gravastar will shed light on even the deepest mysteries of the universe. The weighty object could explain intense gamma ray bursts from t he distant universe. More boldly, they suggest the entire cosmos could itself be trapped insi de a giant gravastar. Astronomers call the work of Mottola and Mazur everything from \"outstandingly brilliant\" to \"unlikely.\" Perhaps it will take decades or longer for"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"anyone to know really. Emil Mottola of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Pawel Mazur of the University of South Carolina in Columbia think gravastars are cold, dense shells supported by a springy, weird space inside . They'd look like black holes, lit only by the material raining down onto them from out side. In fact, they seem to fit all the observational evidence for the existence of black holes. The result of a black hole is a \"singularity\" with infinite densit y, where the known laws of physics break down. The singularity's gravity would be so powerful i twould be cloaked in an \"event horizon\", a oundary beyond which matter or light couldn 't escape. The dramatic idea of a black hole, which would rip to shreds anyone caught inside it, fired the imaginations of scientists, artists and writer s alike. But no one has ever rooted the drama in fact, and Einstein completely repudiated it. We know there are compact objects millions of times as heavy as the Sun that h og the centers of galaxies. These black hole candidates give themselves away bec ause hot stars, gas and dust spiraling toward them emit bright X-rays. But that does n't mean there's a cataclysmic black hole in the vicinity; it could simply be a very massive object. The debate petered out decades ago but there's still no i ronclad proof that black holes exist. There are enough problems in black-hole theory itself to make their exi stence seem implausible to say the least. These problems stem from the fact that our Universe is actually very different from the one that Schwarzschild considered. If we're to produce a proper description of the Universe we live in, Einstein's c lassical theories need to be meshed together with what we know about the quantum laws govern ing the behavior of fundamental particles and fields. Mazur and Mottola have been thinking about quantum gravity for nearly a decade. They began by examining the nature of \"quantum fluctuations\" in space, tim e and even in energy fields. Empty space, for example, is never really empty. On the tiniest scales, little particles are popping in and out of existence all the ti me, creating a seething, fluctuating fluid. \"Like a fish in a calm pond, who is not aware of all the incessant jiggling of the water molecules, we are usually not aware of the qu antum medium we are immersed in,\" Mottola said. And they have found that quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic fi elds that describe tiny things like photons can influence gravitational phenomena on the large scale-such as black holes. So, they reasoned, when early black hole theorists i gnored quantum effects they were creating an unreal space-time. When a star forms a black hole, all the unique information about the star -- its chemical composition, for instance -- appears to be squashed out of existe nce. Yet current theory suggests black holes have enormous entropy -- a billion, bill ion times that of the star that formed them. No one can fathom where all this extra entrop y comes from or where it resides. \"Where are all these zillions of state s hiding in a black hole?\" says Mottola. \"It is quite literally incomprehensible.\" Blac k holes are a bag of contradictions that don't make a good case for their own existence at all."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Mazur and Mottola have shown that quantum effects can make space-time change into a new and curious state that would lead to the formation of a strange new object. That change is a phase transition, like liquid water turning into a solid block of ice. They believe that in the extreme conditions of a collapsing star, space -time undergoes a quantum version of a phase transition. The phenomenon is nothing new. The Nobel Prize for Physics in 2001 was awarded for the observation of just such an event in the lab: the transformation of a cloud of atoms into one huge \"super-atom,\" a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). This clump of atoms, whi ch all share the same quantum state, forms at temperatures within a whisker of absolute zero. When an event horizon is about to form around a collapsing star, Mazur and Mottola believe that the huge gravitational field distorts the quantum flu ctuations in space-time. These fluctuations would become so huge they would trigger a radical change in space-time, very similar to the formation of a BEC. This would cre ate a condensate bubble. It would be surrounded by a thin spherical shell composed of gravitational energy, a kind of stationary shock wave in space-time sitting exactl y where the event horizon of a black hole would traditionally be. The form ation of this condensate would radically alter the space-time inside the shell. Acc ording to Mazur and Mottola's calculations, it would exert an outward pressure. Because of th is, infalling matter inside the shell would do a U-turn and head back out to the shell, while matter outside the shell would still rain down on it. What's exc iting, they say, is that gravastars don't suffer any of the mathematical ailments of black holes . There's no riotous singularity where the laws of physics break down. T here's no event horizon to imprison light and matter. And the entropy of a gravastar would be much lower than that of any star that might collapse to form it, dodging the problem of excessive entropy that plagues black holes. Take a gravastar with a mass 50 times that of the Sun wouldn't emit any radiation, making it as black as any black hole would be. Marek Abramowicz, an expert on black holes at Gothenbur g University in Sweden thinks they might explain gamma-ray bursts -- ultr a-intense flashes of gamma radiation from a distant source that appear somewhere in th e sky about once a day. The birth of a gravastar would be extraaordinarily violent and might shed enough energy to account for gamma-ray bursts. Three years ago, data from distant stellar explosions suggested that the expansi on of the Universe is getting faster all the time ( New Scientist , 11 April 1998, p 26). Many physicists ascribe this acceleration to a mysterious \"dark energy\" that gives space an outward pressure. Mottola says that if you scale the size of a gravastar up to around the size of the visible Universe, the pressure of the vacuum insi de roughly matches the pressure that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe. So our Universe might be one big cosmic gravastar: a giant shell trapping the M ilky Way and all the other galaxies we see. \"We might be able to entertain the really radical notion that we -- and everything we see in the Universe -- could be i nside such an object,\" Mottola speculates. A gravastar would differ from a black hole by shining more brightly, since matter falling onto one would be turned int o radiation. Black holes would gobble all the matter, but a gravastar would let its energy es cape."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"All the same, Mottola and Mazur admit there are still unsolved issues w ith the formation of gravastars. \"We must have a better idea of how this phase transition actually occurs in the gravitational collapse process,\" says Mottola. But if gravastars can weather the controversy, then maybe there'll no longer be any nee d for black holes -- maybe they really are pure fantasy. It wouldn't be the first time that Einstein's dazzling intuition has been proved correct. (Sour ce: New Scientist , Cosmiverse Staff Writer).

CHAPTER I: THE MAGUS HERMES "},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"As Trump I, the Magus is the Initiator of the transformational process. The internal flow of archetypal processes is like a musical symphony. It is nonlinear, complex an d dynamic. It is a flow of pure spontaneous creativity, unfolding possibilities. Individ ual archetypes are seen as the various instruments within that melody. While most are easily id entified, Hermes remains the most vague to grasp and to truly understand. He is the most diffuse because he is the translator, the magician, the s hape-shifter, the trickster even liar, the chameleon. He is ithyphallic; his wayside sh rines called ' herms ' glorified the penis in ancient times. Wearing an erect phallus fetis h was believed to bring good luck. Exploring the creative consciousness flow is much like being in a foreign country. We simply do not speak the language. Alchemy and magick were the psychological languages of the past. Hermes acts as our communicator, a guide or me ntor to deliver messages between gods and men, divine and mortal -- like a protot ypical winged angel -- a psychopomp or soul-guide. Since our attention is usually on the message, not the message-bringer, w e seldom realize it is the magician who pulled the rabbit out of the hat. We loose the image of what H ermes is when he delivers the message. When we are immersed in the stream of c onsciousness, we forget that not only are we receiving a communication from a specific god, but He rmes's translation of that message is also present. And it is our individual react ion to that complex which forms the musical symphony. His method of communications is through a system of correspondences. Thes e acausal relationships are experienced as synchronicity. Synchronistic events ar e those subjective experiences that make up life's meaningful coincidences. Herme s is the magician who has the ability to cross dimensional boundaries, as a mediator between the hu man and the divine, the personal psyche and the unconscious. His realm includes the physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritu al planes of consciousness. When considering Hermes, remember that \"the mediu m is the message.\" He is the archetype of information theory--how information controls and patter ns energy. He is the mentor of the information age. As Tom Lyttle puts it, \" My higher-intelligence semantics... well it goes a little like this: M an is made in God's image, and while not equal to God can do everything Jesus did and more, so Jesus told all of us many times. So we are both higher-intelligence in real- time, plus HI echoing itself backwards in time, retrocausally. That way it seeds itself all ways across time as all potential. So we have feedback and feedforward in our physical neural-nets - our minds are only partly physical, however. The other parts of human consciousness, \"min d-at-large\" if you will... exist as orthogonal zip-files, in hyperspace...in dreamland. That is, Godhood is enfolded in each as coded-language/neural-net geometries. Some parts are physical, other parts hyperdimensional. We deconstruct, defrag, unzip, decode , decipher etc. and find the obvious - ourselves, then our higher-selves, then God, who has be en sitting in our hearts waiting for us, all along, smiling. \" Much the same information transduction process occurs in our lives wh en we translate ideas into action or live what we aspire to. We can manipulate our reality and harne ss our"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"energies, through concentration on purpose. Through this means we have the abi lity to change our desires into a new reality through skill, preparation, effort, pers istence, commitment and integrity. We need to be aware where we are focusing our ene rgy; what our objectives are; how we are communicating with others, and what we w ant others to see and believe. We need to let Spirit guide that process of unfolding potential . The Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus was full of this metaphysical spi ritual power. He is the godfather of all the Hermetic Arts, the mystic arts and occult powers, as w ell as science. He has power over language, writing, and signs like his predecesor, the Egyptian god , Thoth. The Hermetica included works on magic, alchemy, astrology, healing, gnosis, theur gy, ritual and philosophy. These texts were based on notions of sympathetic magic, that like substances sharing an essence could influence one another through reson ance effects. Likewise the hypnotic and magnetic qualities of charismatic individ uals can create rapport with others to influence them. It has been said (Mulholland, The Art of Illusion , 1944) that, \"Magic is the pretended performance of those things which cannot be done. The success of a magician's si mulation of doing the impossible depends upon misleading the minds of his audiences. This, in the main, is done by adding, to a performance, details of which the spectators are unaware, and leavin g out others which they believe you have not left out. In short a performance of magic is largely a demonstrations of the universal reliability of certain facts of psychology.\" Just as the trump number of the Magician is I, in Hermetic philosophy, God i s One and the creator of all things which continue to depend on Him. Everything is part of God, and God is in everything, his creative activity continuing unceasingly. All things ar e one and the pleroma of being is indestructible. Divine powers knit together the energies of the sun, planets and stars, and they operate on all bodies, animate or inanimate. This is t he notion of cosmic sympathy. This doctrine of sympathy applies to man in both body and spi rit, in the magico-religious worldview of The Magus. PHYSICAL FORM It is well known that all mass is charged; thus everything is in one sense electricity. Hermes is the polarity charge on the zygote at the instant of fertilization. As pure information, Hermes is the DNA code, messenger RNA, translating from the virtual t o the physical realms. He is the embryonic nervous system, and the electrical charge tr aveling through that nervous system. Electrical signals mediate chemical changes in the body. Since the charge moving through the body is directly related to physical chemistry, Hermes is also the \"ch emical messenger.\" An excellent example of Hermes in this aspect is as a hormone . Hormones affect every aspect of human physiology, from growth to metabolism, organ functionin g, sexuality, and fertility. Personalities dominated by the perspective of Hermes seem to be inter ested in the hidden side of things, the enfolded or implicate aspect. Implicate comes fro m the Latin word implicio , to enfold or imply. It is that aspect of reality which lies behind the \"vei l\" of"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"manifestation. These individuals see themselves as the carriers of the secret codes or lore, of things that are not on the surface. Hermes, as the Trickster, has a dark side, like all archetypes. The behavior p atterns of the Hermes-dominated person may lead into his opportunistic characterist ic pursuits. Hermes rules merchants, thieves, and salespersons. Hermes is also the god of travele rs who inspires an incurable wanderlust. He is the prime motivator behind compulsi ve questing, the search for something--the personal Holy Grail. Another Hermetic role is to seek out and convey the hidden messages and meanings in synchronous events. These meaningful coincidences, used as a form of pers onal development (pathworking), serve as a form of metaphorical perception. It mean s seeking the hidden archetypal patterns in the apparent chaos of daily life. In thi s way, the Tree of Life with its paths, serves as an objective guide to the unconscious--a c onsciousness map of the deep psyche. Hermes is also the gods who brings revelations, whether t hrough depth psychology or the interpretations of divinations such as I Ching or astrology. Looking for the god in a disease, Hermes' style is seen in schizophrenia, as seen in the movie \" A Beautiful Mind, \" about physicist John Nash. This style thrives on plural meanings, cryptic double-talk, in escaping definitions, and psychically d etaching body parts. The dissociation aspect of \"falling apart\" makes possible a new st yle of reflection in the psyche--a change in attraction from one archetype to another. Hermes' particular form of mysticism opens the doors to the transformat ion of mysticism into theurgy. It can degrade into thaumaturgy -- the attempt to influence or control the physical plane -- mundane magic. Then the master of the secret \"names \" himself takes on the exercise of power in the way described in the various magical and theurgi cal procedures of which this literature is full. There is a fine line be tween magic and mysticism, especially in the use of divine names in mystical prayers and magic operati ons -- the danger of slipping from \"good, inward\" mystical practices to \"degraded, outward\" magic i s a constant threat which, to Scholem, must be avoided. While the main goal of mysticism is an experience of another consciousness, th e use of magical powers only reinforces the mystic/magician's relationship wit h mundane reality -- recall, that magic in this sense is called \"Practical,\" as it has a practical use in everyday living -- e.g.: gaining wealth, love, health, and good crops. Who made these names important? Where do the words come from, and how are they calculated? Magicians who claim to be \"Kabbalists\" often use the practices of gematri a, notarikon, and temurah to calculate new words of power and angelic names. It would appear t hat the magicians believe that anyone who uses these techniques can be called a \" Kabbalist\". However, according to Scholem, these practices were rarely used in classi cal Kabbalah -- \"What really deserves to be called Kabbalism has very little to do with these \" Kabbalistic\" practices\" (Scholem, 1941; p. 100). Nonetheless, such practices can be found in Kabbalistic documents. I t is accepted magical doctrine that to know the name of a certain power, be it an angel, spirit (typical ly evil), or intelligence (typically good), is to control that power: \"the 'real' name of a god or an idea"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"contains the essence of the god or the idea, and therefore enshrines it s power. Using the name turns this power on automatically, the same way that pressing the ligh t switch turns on the light\" (Cavendish, 1967; p. 123). In a similar fashion, Crowley (1976) remarks that the names of God are really names for the forces of nature, which can then be u sed. Specific occupations associated with Hermes are: accountant book seller clerk codebreaker comedian consultant electrician gypsy hypnotist journalist linguist magician media mentor messenger occultist postmaster programmer psychologist researcher salesperson secretary spy stamp collector teacher tekkie telephone operator thief tourist trader translator writer EMOTIONAL IMAGE Hermes is the god of boundaries; dreams take place in the boundaries be tween deep sleep and waking life. We turn to the god Hermes for our dream messages; he brin gs us these messages. In sleep the chaotic nonlinear, multiple consciousness domin ates or awareness. Linear consciousness is asleep and benefits by the rejuvenating contac t with the creative consciousness stream. It helps our adaptability and promotes our evoluti onary development."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"No matter the effort, the dream is always chaotic, clouded with ambiguity an d the significance carried by symbols because of their multiple meanings. T he dream always seems to carry multiple meanings which can never be unraveled by our nor mal consciousness. Dreams are not logical. Yet they can teach the waking ego some thing of a different perspective on ourselves, a perspective which contains an ironical humor. The Hermetic viewpoint does not take a moral position in regard to the conte nt of any given dream. Since Hermes embodies paradoxes such as good/evil simultaneous ly, no moral guidelines are available from dreams for the ego or for navigation in day-to-day lif e. The dream represents the \"underworld,\" or unconsciousness of the dre amer. The ego's arbitrary moral views are an alien viewpoint in dreams. Morality is rooted in the belief system, and dreams originate in a much deeper level. As a bisexual being, the Hermaphrodite represents the borderline in n ature. The Hermaphrodite is an imaginal being. Hermes and his borderline nature i s the place where sexuality and fantasy meet. He prompts therapeutic relationships wher e transference is the movement in life. He governs the change from one state of consciousness to an other-- through synaptic impulse, through chemical mediation with neurotransm itters, and through magic. As the god who presides over boundaries, Hermes is able to transcend them. H e is therefore also the ruler of ceremonial Magick. In Magick, one transcends t he limits of ordinary consciousness and communes with various forms of divine conscious ness. The identification with a given energy is accomplished by a three-fold ri tual. 1). Separation from the profane or ordinary state of consciousness. Dissolution of the ordinary state of consciousness. 2). The transition stage, or twilight zone which lies between. Creative or chaotic consciousness. 3). The new order or perception of reality which occurs in the sacred time of the soul. Identification with an enhanced sense of self, greater well-bein g. Hermes is the lord of boundaries, or doorways, the threshold or liminal area. The inbetween, or twilight zone, in enables a state of receptivity to become established. It allows an emptying process, a letting go. Ritual acts reawaken deep layers of the psych e. This brings the mythological or archetypal ideas back to memory. Though the basic, or original forms of Magick and schizophrenic fantasy (wis h fulfillment) spring from the same roots, they are not synonymous. Magick is, in general, the tran sition from passivity to activity. The Will is essential. Realistic action does not fol low schizophrenic magic or magical thinking. The fantasy is a substitute f or action. In lower forms of magic, practiced for personal gain or ego gratification or power, the ego is either weak or absent, or over-inflated. In ceremonial Magick there is a conscious eff ort directed at self-transformation, by harmonizing conscious and unconscious cycles or rhythms. Writing was originally a form of magic, an epiphany with the god and secret of th e priests. It is perhaps mankind's most far-reaching creation, taking almost an infi nite variety of"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"forms. Many societies have created their own forms of conventional visible mark s linked to spoken language. No other invention but the wheel has had such a lasting impac t. Much of it's power comes from its flexibility. But the purpose of writ ing remains unchanged: to convey meaning from mundane to profound. It is a potent form of art istic and political expression. We use it to combat loneliness and establish ou r sense of self. Aristotle called it a way to express the \"affections of the soul.\" Writing abou t feelings can alleviate depression, loost the immune system, and lower blood pressure . To write, you must work methodically, forming your thoughts to lead to the reader toward your conclusions. However, writing can also distort or mislead. Writing has immortalized the events and persons of history, religion, passi on, genius, art, and science. It has tremendous evocative power to express everything from t he practicalities of everday life to the most exalted human emotions. In anci ent times, alphabets were alphnumeric, standing for both letters and numbers. S acred letters could \"add up\" to a meta-meaning shared with other words of the same number. Al phabets changed the way people thought, leading to formal logic, theoretical science an d the concept of linear time. Hermes is the god who rules technological acumen, and his latest incarnati on is in our computer-driven society. He is the silicon chip, the electrical i mpulse, the fantasy of the cybernaut and cyborg. He is the computer whiz, the programmer, the tekki e. But he is still the motivating archetype behind all the sciences--the quest to unrave l and control the hidden secrets of nature and the physical universe. He also governs the myst eries of the mind--the science of parapsychology, which inhabits the borderline bet ween \"hard\" sciences and the occult. These modern fields all have their own arcane rituals. This is an excitin g field of study that may turn ritual studies, indeed all social sciences, in new direction s. The ritual theorists that are already incorporating brain science into their work generally rely on a ve ry small circle of researchers and writers: people like Eugene d’Aquili, Ch arles Laughlin, John McManus, and Barbara Lex who have called their field of study biogenetic str ucturalism. \"Biogenetic structuralism\" is an unfortunately complicated name f or a promising line of inquiry that seeks to apply knowledge of the evolution and structure of th e human body to various human or cultural behaviors. It has particularly focused upon ritual and religious experience to demonstrate its methods, which is not unexpected given the strong influence of structuralism on ritual studies in general and the centrality of ritu al and religion in most human cultures. Even though hampered by an unwieldy name and method, ritu al theorists are beginning to pay attention to the interesting contributions the fiel d seeks to make. Along with performance theory, Ron Grimes has called biogenetic struct uralism one of the \"most promising theoretical currents regarding ritual.\"Biogenetic s tructuralism seeks a holistic understanding of the universe as it presents itself to the mind through experience and is comprehended at the theoretical level through the activities of science. Charles Laughlin echoes the interdisciplinary nature of the field, not ing that it has sought to take into account \"all reasonable sources of data about human consciousness and culture,\" but specifically, anthropology, psychology, and the neurosciences. H e adds that it"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"also has sought to be \"non-dualistic in modeling mind and body\" and non-red uctionistic. That is, it argued that culturally universal, invariant structures of language , time and space, dreams, feelings, and some psychopathologies arise from brain struct ures that are the product of human evolution. To the classic Levi-Strauss/Chomski idea of the existence of \"deep st ructure\" within the unconscious that affects human cognition and behavior, they therefore add t hat these structures are related to specific parts or neural pathways in the br ain itself. 12 The human brain is genetically predisposed to organize its experience in particul ar ways and to develop along predictable paths in a process they called \"neurognosis.\"In a central chapter of The Spectrum of Ritual , \"The Neurobiology of Myth and Ritual,\" d’Aquili and Laughlin outlined a basic position that would be elaborated upon in other places, es pecially the 1999 book by d’Aquili and Newberg, The Mystical Mind. Briefly, the d’Aquili/Lauglin article asserted that ritual accompl ishes two important biological feats. First, it coordinates the neural systems and functions of ritual participants to allow for group action. Ritual behavior for most species seems to be a way of overcom ing social distance between individuals so that they can coordinate their act ivity in a way that would help the species survive. Mating rituals are the most obvious example of this, but ritual activity before coordinated group attacks or hunts are also common. Wolf pac ks go through ceremonial tail-wagging sessions and group howls, and ritual aggressi on among primates establishes social order and rank for possible battle. The rhythmic and repetitious nature of ritual stimulation, through ear, e ye, or bodily motion, increases a sense of unity of purpose between individuals. Furt her, it leads to coordinated arousal or discharge of the brain’s limbic system, leading to a sens e of profound unity within the participants. The second biological achieveme nt of ritual is that it causes cognitive development or socialization within the individual or ganism. Ritual is \"a mechanism for entraining and transforming the structure of the neuromo tor subsystems in the developing organism.\" In short, it teaches the younger members of th e species what is important and how to behave. Tom Driver described humans well when he called us \"ritualizing ani mals.\" Like other animals, humans have evolved to enact ritualizations, both, \"to give stability to our behaviors and to serve as vehicles of communication.\" We share this tendency with bees that dance, peacocks that display, and whales that breech and slap their fluk es. Indeed, there is evidence that the domestic dog developed its ritualizations t o exploit the human need for a working companion. So ritualizing is evolutionarily adaptive for many anim als, and none more than the human animal. But human rituals are unique in that they seem to be invariably connected with myth. How do such myths arise in the human brain ? What is their adaptive significance and why do we relate them so closely with our ritual behavior? Myths, according to d’Aquili, present themselves as systems of antinomie s, or opposites: heaven/hell, good/evil, life/death, because of a basic function of the brain t hat he calls the \"binary operator.\" This function abstracts qualities of things and arranges them as pairs of opposites, or dyads, whose meaning is intimately related to its partner. He conjectures that it is located on the inferior parietal lobe of the dominant side, and is simply one way"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"that the mind seeks to understand the world. Myths play upon these anti nomies and propose solutions to them. So, we create myths to satisfy our need to understand our environment and t o give us some sense of control over it, or at least an understood place within it. A given myth has stability (is an enduring structure of relationships of meaning) because it \"is adaptive psychophysiologically for an individual or social group.\" But understanding alone is not adaptive enough. Like other animals we seek t o adapt ourselves physically to the environments in which we live. Therefore we n eed a way to make the myth real to us, and that is the fundamental reason why we connect ritual to our myths. One way of describing rituals, then, is that they are motor actions t hat seek to enact the reality of the mythic structure of meaning our brains instinctual ly produce.This explanation seems similar to Grimes’ ritual mode of \"magic,\" or ritual as a \"m eans to an end\" and is a common anthropological explanation for the rise of ritual and religi on in human history D’Aquili and Laughlin report research that shows that when either the arousal or quiescent system is maximally stimulated it results in a \"spillover effect\" or a stimulation of the other system. That is, experts in meditation may experience a \"rush\" or a release of energy during a hyperquiescent state. From the other side, those who engage in rhythmic rituals that engage the arousal system, such as energetic dancing and singing, m ay experience states of bliss, tranquility, and oneness with others. Hyperar ousal and hyperquiescent states seem to stimulate the limbic system, which regulates our emotions. Hence, these states are experienced as being emotionally intense, and often pleasurable. It is also during these \"spillover\" experiences that the paradoxes prese nted to the brain through myth become resolved by the simultaneous functioning of both hem ispheres of the brain. In ritual stimulation of the arousal system, for example, the present ation of what is an unresolvable logical problem in the left brain (the wafer is both bre ad and the Body of Christ), is experienced as unified in the holistic operation of the ri ght brain. Ritual participants therefore may experience a resolution of the probl ems presented by the myth and a deep unity with other participants: \"The simultaneous str ong discharge of both parts of the autonomic nervous system creates a state that consists not onl y of a pleasurable sensation, but, also, under proper conditions, a sense of union with con specifics and a blurring of cognitive boundaries.\" Similarly, those who engage in meditation may report that they experience resolution of paradoxes during some meditative state s, hence the famous use of such paradoxes by Zen practitioners. Both meditation and ritual can lead to the spillover effect and the simult aneous discharge of the arousal and quiescent systems. But they come at the experience f rom different directions. Meditation begins with the quiescent system and by its hy peractiviation can achieve spillover into the arousal system (from trophotropic to ergotropic ). Ritual approaches from the opposite system (from ergotropic to trophotropic). In summary, according to biogenetic structural analysis, humans do ritual for th e same reasons other animals do them: to diminish distance between other mem bers of the species,"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"to coordinate group action, socialize their young, and communicate status and soci al structure. What is unique about human ritualizing is its connection to th e human propensity to create myths. Myths themselves contain logical or story resolu tions to the paradoxes of our lives, but do not solve the problem existentially because they r emain only as logical or left-brain solutions. D’Aquili and other biogenetic structuralists have countered that r itual, in fact, does work effectively for us because it brings mythical paradoxes and unsolved problem s to resolution through excitation of neurological processes by motor activity. The myths becom e experienced fact. Because such a resolution promotes a sense of unity wit h others and is a pleasurable experience, it is highly adaptive for humans who are trying to m ake their way in the world. The point for ritual theorists and liturgists is that we are in an age when science is putting forth plausible, if not exhaustive, accounts of the rise of religion and ritual . Frankly, in many cases, they are doing much better public theology of ritual than we are, if b y that you mean making a persuasive case for the continued meaning and power of religiou s ritual in the future of the human species. It seems inevitable that sociobiology, ne urophysiology, and evolutionary theory will continue to open up new questions and tools for analys is of our rites. Human religious ritual behavior is one of the many areas where, as St ephen Gould describes, science and religion, \"belly right up to each other, and inter digitate in the most intimate and complex manner.\" Nor is human religious experience or ritual behavior reducible to an explan ation of neuron pathways. We may confidently say, as Crick does about the soul, that there is no ritu al behavior or religious experience that somehow floats above the physicality of ou r brains (\"metaphysical news from nowhere,\" as Don Saliers has been heard to say). But the interplay in ritual of brain physiology, cultural evolution, local religious trad itions, group experiences, individual interpretations and emotions, makes the desc ription of any given ritual event a highly complex matter, necessarily involving many fields and sp ecialties. Because ritual is so complex a matter and reaches so deeply into all the level s of our humanity—biological, cultural, social, and religious—any method that tends toward black/white language should be suspect.

Hermeneutics is the science of interpreting the sc riptures, so it isn't very surprising to see Hermes identified with the creative Logos, the me ssenger with The Word. Logically, he is the law of reason, being the Word. Hermes is also the condition o f its utterance. Because he is duality, he can represent both truth and false hood, wisdom and folly. Hermes is the trickster in that if he can not attain his ends by fai r means, he does it by foul. As stated earlier, falling apart makes possible a new style of reflection in the psyche, as the old outworn rigidities dissolve and flow is re-established. Hermes as Mercury moves among the multiple parts. He is also a cheat who can deceive with half-truths. Sometimes truths are even harder to see through, especially paradoxes. Hermes is an interpreter; understanding is never absolute. It always r equires interpretation. He bridges the unconscious condition that produces my th, symbols, and metaphors to the conscious mind through this interpretation. The ima ges are to be left free of moral judgements. If Hermes is the only appointed messenger to Hades, then he provides his gu idance also within the psychology of the Underworld. Hermes helps us relate to the d ifficult, frightening, pathological, and complex part of our psyche. He can in this way also h elp us interpret depression. This forms the basis of psychological analysis. Hermeneutics is a branch of philosophy. Is is the science and art of inter pretation, especially of spiritual texts. In ancient Egypt the invention of writing was ascribed to the corresponding deity Thoth, known in Greece as Hermes, and Rome as Mer cury. Hans-Georg Gadamer is a German philosopher who studied with Heidegger b ut developed the theory that language, not time and culture, determines consciousness . Gadamer only came to prominence as a philosopher with the publication of Truth A nd Method in 1960; and his role is best seen as part of the postwar rehabilitation of German philosophy. Academic philosophy in 20th-century Germany falls into two distinct phas es. The first half of the century was fascinated by the idea of reason as something historical. It w as to be"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"understood not as some neutral instrument, equally available to all thinki ng creatures, and subject to universal rules accessible to all, but as being rooted in the par ticular circumstances of time or culture. Heidegger's celebrated notion of Das ein (existence, but - literally - \"being here\") was a revolt against the \"analytical\" traditions of th e late 19th century and the thought that the truths described by philosophy were i ndifferently available to all people, whether \"here\" (that is, part of this culture) or n ot. Gadamer withdraws from the extreme standpoint of prewar existential ism - that Being is fixed by historical and cultural circumstance, replacing this ontologica l radicalism with a theory of language. For him, Being is not constituted as such by race and nationali ty, but, in a celebrated dictum: \"Being that can be understood is language.\" If I h ave no word for something, it does not \"exist\" for me, so existence, or failure to exist, happen s within language. Without language, there is no understanding, and language is a product of history and culture. According to Gadamer, language is a historical phenomenon for two reasons. One is practical. Language is about communication. It is about transferring, aggregating and processing information. The ability of language to perform these functions depends on the skill with which its users understand each other in any particular case. Language determines consciousness; and this determination depends on how well people have communicated. \"Hermeneutics\", for Gadamer, means \"understanding\" in this concrete sense. One aspect of this, for his own work, was a renewed emphasis on rh etoric as the discipline of making language function in practice. Another aspect is hi s famous model of reasoning as dialogue. Language's second historical characteristic is that it articulates cultural identities. Gadamer shares the existentialist suspicion of projects which pur port to determine truths and values by means of abstract calculation. As far as values are concerned, we ine vitably start off in the historical \"here\" in some way we cannot further analyse. In that respect, as Gadamer argues, valuative (moral or artistic) judgments are quite properly \" prejudices\" (Vor-urteile , \"pre-judgments\"). This is not a bad thing, for, as long as we recognise what is happening, we can start to engage in the hermeneutic dialogue which language off ers to us, and so overcome the limitations of our own starting position and move towards a ri cher understanding of ourselves and others. Typically, this takes place in more or less formalised hermeneutic \" dialogues\" which strive to reconcile inconsistent valuative positions. Major examples would be d iscussion about the value of works of art, and the legal discourse of the courtroom. Gadamer's theories bore most philosophical fruit in the 60s and 70s, not l east in exchanges with other \"linguistic\" theories such as that of J|rgen Habermas. Subs equently, Gadamer's academic influence has become largely confined to the cultural disc iplines; in Germany itself, the predominant analytical tone has now more or less extinguishe d philosophical historicism. (Julian Roberts, Guardian , Monday March 18, 2002). Jung, who was perhaps influenced by this school, also extensively explored the realm of hermeneutics in analytical psychology, particularly in regard to alchemy. Polyani (1962) carried his ideas forward when he said: \" Heuristic passion is...the mainspring of"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"originality...the force which impels us to abandon an accepted framework of interpr etation and commit ourselves by the crossing of a logical gap, to the use of a new framework .\" Heuristics is behind our current notion of \"paradigm shift. Polanyi goes on to say that, \" Having made a discovery, I shall never see the world again as before. My eyes have become different; I have made myself into a person seein g and thinking differently. I have crossed a gap, a heuristic gap, which lies between problem and dis covery .\" According to Umberto Eco, 'semiotics is concerned with everything that c an be taken as a sign.' Semiotics is the study of signs which have a role in social life -- an ything that 'stands for' something else.. Semiotics also has a correspondence with linguisti cs as well as Hermes and Hermetic philosophy. This transdisciplinary subject is diffic ult to define. Linguistics is only one branch of this general science. In a sense every thought is a sign -- how meanings are made and reality maintained . Semiotics is concerned with how signs mean, not what words mean. Syntactics (or syntax) is the formal or structural relations between signs. Semiotics is often us ed to analyze texts. It explores various genres or mediums of communication from print to mass m edia to interpersonal communication. These are differences of channel and te chnology. Our multisensory experience is constrained by the medium involved; they gi ve us different frameworks for representing our experiences. Media impose a dialogue wit h the materials and means of execution -- the use of the medium is expressive. It refers not only to visual signs, including drawings, paintings and photogr aphs, images, objects but also sound, musical sounds and gestures or body language, and media st udies in general. It encompasses all these which form the content of ritual -- s ystems of signification. Semiotics searches for deep structures, the grammar of narrative, the relative positions of parts within a self-contained system, the use of signs in specific s ocial situations, and the role of beliefs or ideologies. It is rarely quantitative or content analysis. It looks at structured wholes, the system of rules governing the 'discourse' involve d in media texts and how semiotic context shapes meaning. Semiotics represents a range of studies in art, literature, anthropology, mass media, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and aesthetics. It is concerne d with significance, linguistic and non-linguistic, intentional and unint entional communication. It explores modes of production of signs and meanings, how systems and codes are used, transformed or transgressed in social practice. Semiotics teaches us that reality is plastic, a subjective construction. It teaches us reality is a systems of signs. To dec line such a study is to leave to others the control of the world of meanings which we inhabit (Chandler, http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem01.html).

Metaphors are one of the cognitive mechanisms that lead to the discovery and advancement of new theories. Often, in science, they appear spontaneously in dreams which are then applied in real time. Metaphor and analogy help us create m apping between two domains in a one-to-one correlation. Metaphor still plays a role in the articulation of new scientific theory. In cognitive psychology, metaphors are drawn from the terminology of computer science, in transpersonal psychology from mysticism, in Consciousness Restructur ing Process from Chaos Theory, QM, Holographic and other theories. Thus, science recycles its metaphors in self-referential strange loops. Alchemists made use of symbolic metaphors, but ascribed causal powers to metaphorical similarities, (creating the so-called \"doctrine of signatures.\"). In th is way they tried to satisfy their wish to manipulate nature rather than know it. But, metaphors may be nature , our nature; or certainly phenomenological expressions of our existential nat ure. They provide a reference point without defining reality. The problem becomes not one of how to know something radically new, but how to learn something radically new. Thus metaphors are instructive. They are a centr al Way of leaping the epistemological chasm between old and new knowledge, old and n ew ways of essential being. Metaphors help us make this leap. They help us enter a p roblematic situation in order to solve it, to explore it, and explore the world restructur ed by the metaphor. We can tap the source of creativity, healing and holistic restructuring thr ough imagination and metaphor. The possibilities for concepts and for thought are shaped i n very special ways by both the body and the brain that evolved to control it, especially the se nsory-motor system. Conceptual metaphors appear to be neural maps that link sensory-mot or domains in the brain to regions where more abstract reasoning is done. This allows sensory-motor structures to play a role in abstract reason (Lakoff, 1999). The mind-body split or dualism vanishes when bodily control mechanism s are being used in abstract reasoning. Conceptual metaphorical mappings are not primarily mat ters of language, they are part of our conceptual systems, cross-domain mappings, allo wing us to use sensory-motor concepts and reasoning in the service of abstract reason and holistic perception. This metaphorical mapping ability is automatically acquired u nconsciously in our everyday functioning in the world. In fact, when metaphors are synchronistic, emergent, spontaneous, self-organ izing expressions of our dynamic stream of consciousness, they are an imaginal encod ing of information that bridges the domains of conscious and unconscious world s, material and transpersonal realms. Such metaphors can be deeply transformative--mor e than mere language, a technology for changing our behaviors, feelings, thoughts, and beliefs. Intentional contact and immersion in these metaphors can transform our spirit and soul.

Metaphors contain a su btle communication by containing meaning in a delicate net of imagery. In psychother apy and mysticism, both, it is characteristic of the Self to speak to the ego-perso nality in the language of myth and metaphor. It allows us to grasp some image of that which remains as - yet-unknown. The mystical and religious literature of East and West and the secret oral t raditions of esoteric spiritual schools have used myths, parables, similes, symbols an d metaphors to allude to that strange process that somehow changes or transforms our deepes t selves. This is the essence of the Hermetic process. We realize that we must rely on the reports of those who have gone ahead, who have explored further, who have seen and understood more, and who come back and say, \"i ts like this...,\" \"its as if ...\" Metaphor best expresses the as if realm of direct experience which cannot be describe directly. Classical metaphors are those which are u sed and understood crossculturally. Classical metaphors of transformation are embodied in the primordial wis dom traditions. Though they have used many stories and parables, at least ten themes seem to b e recurrent enough to be considered \"classical\" metaphors of transformation within th e meditation tradition. They include the following dynamic transformations of lifest yle, soul and spirit: 1. dream sleep to awakening; 2. illusion to realization; 3. darkness (or blindness) to enlightenment; 4. imprisonment to liberation; 5. fragmentation to wholeness (unifying); 6. separation to oneness (unifying); 7. journey to destination (arriving); 8. being in exile to coming home (returning); 9. from seed to flowering or fruiting plant or tree (unfolding); 10. from death to rebirth (renewal, resurrection). Metaphors are also strongly related to process-oriented psychotherapy and im mersion in the stream of consciousness [itself a metaphor]. The notion and phenom enon of metaphor raises as many questions as it answers. Metaphors do not directly describe perceptual reality, but its language helps us imagine an \"as if\" reality. For example, in Metaphor Therapy (Grove) we ask what an experience is like . The replies about the nature of feelings and traumas come automatically couched in somat o-sensory metaphor: \"like a rock on my chest, like a stab in the back, it leaves me feelin g breathless, disembodied.\" Following the 'trail' we might ask, \"Disembodied like what ?\" \"Like a cloud, like smoke, like a vaporous nothingness\"... The metaphorical possibilities or replies are virtually endless. They embody that which is still unknown and poss ibly unknowable, yet explorable through imagery and dialogue. Metaphor is an artifact of language--saying this to mean that. They function as t ools. That leads us to suspect it is a technology. As such, it is an aid to understanding. Me taphor"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"represents the convergence of figurative language, imagination and consci ousness. There is a fundamental distinction between literal and metaphorical language. John Searle, in his well-known essay Metaphor asserts that there is no semantic difference between metaphoric expression and literal, because \"sentence and wor ds have only the meaning that they have...Metaphorical meaning is always speaker's utterance m eaning.\" Even poetic metaphors can muddle or clarify comprehension by distortin g truth conditions. You say one thing to mean something else. So talking of metaphor as a ki nd of meaning may be false. Yet, the role of conscious and unconscious processes in metaphor pro duction and interpretation is ubiquitous. The role of \"seeing as\" permeates the de velopment of consciousness. It reflects interactions between imagination, percep tion and cognition; how bodily and neural processes create and constrain imagination. Language, conc ept and world are the three realms of metaphor which is a mode of cognition. But metaphors are events, not objects. And generative-metaphors can be view ed as problem-setting scenes and problem-solving situations. [Tacit generat ive metaphors may underlie our perceptual patterns much as personal and collective myt hologies do]. Metaphors describe the internal structure of domains and how they are re presented; the nature and organizational structure of information. They follow the information processing approach and propose a spatial representation in which local subspaces can b e mapped into points of higher-order hyperspaces, and vice versa. The distance among c oncepts in these mental spaces is the main parameter for establishing the compr ehensibility and aesthetic pleasure of metaphors. Conceptual metaphors are more than semantic representations; they i mply deep action, even though the locus of metaphor is thought. They directly reflect our met aphorical understanding of experience. This dual coding is based on more than a theor etical point of view based in imagery and verbal association. Metaphor is not merely a superficial phenomenon of language, but shapes ou r judgments, and structures our language. Displaying many facets, metaphor pervades our ever yday non-theoretical language. A metaphor is a holistic schema, a unifying framew ork that links a conceptual representation to its sensory and experiential ground. It emb odies the gestalt and ecological properties of thought. The network of underlying metaphors form a cognitive map, a web of concepts organ ized in terms which serve to ground the abstract. This cognitive topology, by which we impose structure on space, gives rise to spatial inferences and images. The subje ctive ego-centric properties of the individual are projected onto the world via this cognitive mapping. Even the same metaphor of 'time' can produce different interpretation s, depending on the relative position of the observer within his cognitive topology. Mental pictures and verbal processes meet in metaphor which promot es retrieval of images and verbal information that intersects with information aroused by the t opic. Language is a conduit for this force by transferring or conveying thoughts and feelings to others."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Therefore what is literal can also be metaphorical; only the literal use of language can be true or false. These facts underlie or form the dynamical basis of all talk th erapies. George Lakoff and others have developed contemporary theories of metaphor. Und eniably, there are a great many irreducible metaphorical concepts in our everyday l ife which function in a systematic way and are grounded in our physical and cultural expe rience. But what is metaphor a metaphor for? How do metaphors work ? How can we interpret two levels of understanding, novel and classical metaphors for comprehension an d understanding? Can we learn without metaphors? Epistemological metaphors help us relate \"how we know what we know.\" They help us frame and describe our experience and its meaning at both the personal and collective levels. However, when do our epistemological metaphors become more than models? When we \"know,\" how do we \"know that we know,\" and \"what is it like ?\" This bears on the confusion surrounding the process and products of linguistic understanding. How do psychological processes figure in metaphor comprehension and mem ory? When we think in metaphors, do they create similarity, or state some pre-exist ing similarity? Do they produce new knowledge by projecting the \"known\" into an unknown dom ain? How do they emphasize, suppress, and organize features of cognition and awareness ? How do we incorporate novelty through similar differences, and different similar ities? What are the educational uses of metaphor? How can we tap directly into multidimensi onal metaphoric process? What is beyond metaphor: what is the role in cognition and consciousness of syne cdoche (inclusion) and metonymy (contiguity)? Metonymy is \"the substitution of some attribute or suggestive word for what is actually meant.\" Metonymy describes extension involving Whole-Part relations in contrast to synecdoche, which involves Part-Whol e relations. Or, it is a figurative extension of meaning involving concomitance. It is arguably possibl e to distinguish between metaphor and metonymy and between non-figurat ive implication and metonymy. The distinctions are cognitively based and have linguistic relevan ce, which improve our understanding of the dynamic role of language in consciousness. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) claim that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical . But metonymy and synecdoche may be just as holistically basic. Expressions in si mile are even more common than metaphor; both follow literalisms. They provide a context for our experience. Metonymy is implied meaning without restriction to the figurative uses of words. It is a figurative extension of meaning involving concomitance. Expressi ng what we sense , feel, think and believe about things and our existential condition, they form the ground of our synergetic cognition about self, others and universe. Although Hades is the Lord of the Underworld, Hermes has some free acce ss there. In contemporary terms this means he has access to the deepest recesses of our subconscious, and can therefore function as a psychoopomp or soul-guide. Both gods share a cert ain style, both covering their heads with a helmet of invisibility. This he lmet hides their thoughts, and it also perceives the hidden thoughts of others. When it is t heir intention to become invisible, we cannot perceive \"where their heads are at.\""},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Even so, there remains a sense of a hidden watch over our innermost thoughts. S ince their motives and goals remain hidden from our conscious perceptions, they have b oth been considered characteristically deceptive, unpredictable, and even fri ghtening. \"We must now accept these basic facts\", as William Burroughs says, \"Mankind exists th rough bestial acts\". Hermes is also the archetypal Trickster, either as a magician or as a clown. S ince the way of descent into the underworld (unconscious) is the way of human frail ty, what is weakness to the hero is the support-system of the clown. You may extract Hermetic guidance from your sensitive areas or psychological \"wounds,\" if you can listen with an at tentive ear. To act out the part of the clown in the mundane world, however, is to be possess ed by Hermes (to literalize it). The comic spirit is a soul-guide which r emains an immortal pattern of existence. We do not become the guide, we are led by him. A health y relationship to the Hermes attitude would be when we are able to accept and laugh at ou r shortcomings. The superconscious side of Hermes is expressed spiritually in the urgy. Theurgy is Divine Activity, that of the Magus with his repertoire of magical operations and re galia. Whereas Thaumaturgy is magick used to make overt changes in the material world, Theu rgy is magick used to make changes for personal evolution and spiritual growth. It is Divine magic, as opposed to mere thaumaturgy or sorcery. The appurtenences and techn ologies of theurgy include the altar, the magickal weapons representing the fundam ental elements of creation, the operations, the incantations of secret names, etc. Its goal is ap otheosis or, less ambitiously, the \"knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\" and th e working of sublimation both of self and world. Jewish scholar Gershom Scholem, in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941/1961) pp. 56- 57 links language and theurgy when he says, \" In this context it is well to remember that the chief peculiarity of this form of mysticism, its emphasis on God's migh t and magnificence, opens the door to the transformation of mysticism into theurgy; there th e master of the secret 'names' himself takes on the exercise of power in the way described in the v arious magical and theurgical procedures of which this literature is full. The language of th e theurgist conforms to that of the Merkabah mystic. Both are dominated by the attributes of power and subl imity, not love or tenderness. It is entirely characteristic of the out-look of the se believers that the theurgist, in adjuring the 'Prince of Divine Presence,' summons the archons as 'Princes of Majesty, Fear and Trembling.' Majesty, Fear and Trembling are indeed the key-words t o this Open Sesame of religion. \" \" The throne-world is to the Jewish mystic what the pleroma, the 'full ness', the bright sphere of divinity with its potencies, aeons, archons and dominions is to the Helleni stic and early Christian mystics of the period who appear in the history of religion unde r the names of Gnostics and Hermetics. The Jewish mystic, though guided by motives sim ilar to theirs, nevertheless expresses his vision in terms of his own religious backgr ound. God's pre-existing throne, which embodies and exemplifies all forms of creation, is at once the goal and t he theme of his mystical vision ,\" (p. 44). \" ...In the Merkabah mysticism with which we are dealing here, the idea of the She khinah ['light of God'] and of God's immanence plays practically no part at all. The one passage in"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"the Greater Hekhaloth' which has been adduced as proof of the existence of such conceptions is based on an obviously corrupt text. The fact is that the true and spontaneous feel ing of the Merkabah mystic knows nothing of divine immanence; the infinite gulf be tween the soul and God the King on His throne is not even bridged at the climax of mystical ecstasy. \"Not only is there for the mystic no divine immanence, there is also almo st no love of God. What there is of love in the relationship between the Jewish mystic an d his God belongs to a much later period and has nothing to do with our present subject. Ecstasy there was and this fundamental experience must have been a source of religious inspiration, bu t we find no trace of a mystical union between the soul and God. Throughout there remained an almost exaggerated consciousness of God's other, nor does the identity and individuality of the mystic become blurred even at the height of ecstatic passion. The Creator and His creatu re remain apart, and nowhere is an attempt made to bridge the gulf between them or to blur the distinction. The mystic who in his ecstasy has passed through all the gates , braved all the dangers, now stands before the throne; he sees and hears - but that is all. All t he emphasis is laid on the kingly aspect of God, not his creative one... \" (pp. 55-56). From magician Israel Regardie, we hear (The Meaning of Magic), \" I suggest, then, that what the Magicians imply by the Astral Light is identical in the last res ort with the Collective Unconscious of modern psychology. By means of the traditional Theurgic techn ique it is possible to contact consciously this plane, to experience its life and influe nce, converse with its elemental and angelic inhabitants so-called, and return here to normal consc iousness with complete awareness and memory of that experience. This, naturally requires t raining. But so does every department of science. Intensive preparation is demanded to fit one for criticial observation, to provi de one with the particular scientific alphabet required for its study, and to acquaint one with t he researches of one's predecessors in that realm. No less should be expected of Magic--though all t oo often miracles are expected without due preparation. Anyone with even the slight est visual imagination may be so trained as to handle in but a short while the elementary m agical technique, by which one is enabled to explore the subtler aspects of life and the universe. To transcend this \"many-coloured world.\" To gain admittance to loftier realms of s oul and spirit is quite another matter. One calling for other faculties and other powers, part icularly a fiery devotion and an intense aspiration to the highest. But with the latter, I am not just now concerned, even though it is the pu lsing heart and more important aspect of Theurgy. It is with the scientific aspect of Magic, its m ore readily verifiable aspect, that I shall deal now. Elsewhere I have given as traditional at tributions or associations to the sphere in question the following symbols. Its planet is s aid to be the Moon, its element Air, its number Nine, its colour purple--and also silver i n another scale. The Pearl and Moonstone are its jewels, aloes its perfume, and its so-called divine name is Shaddai El Chai. The Archangel attributed to it is Gabriel, its choir of Angels are the f our Kerubs ruling the elements, and its geomantic symbols are Populus and Via. The Tarot symbols appe rtaining to this sphere are those cards in each of the four suits numbered IX, and close ly associated with it also is the twenty-first trump card entitled \"The World.\" Here w e find depicted a female form surrounded by a green garland. Actually this trump card is attribute d to the thirty-second path of Saturn which connects the material plain to Yesod. How, now, arises the"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"question, how were these symbols and names obtained? What is their origin? And why are they so called attributions or correspondences of that Sephirah called the F oundation? First of all, meditation will disclose the fact that all have a natural harmon y and affinity one with the other--though not perhaps readily seen at the first glance. For exampl e, the Moon is, to us, the fastest moving planet. It travels through all the twelve sign s of the zodiac in about twenty-eight days. The idea of rapid change is there implicit, revealing the con cept that the astral, while almost a timeless eternal deposit of world events, is neverthe less the origin of mutations and alterations which later influence the physical world--in the same way that impulse and thought must precede any action. Its element is air, a subtle all pervading medium--comparable to the astral light itself--a medium without whic h life is quite impossible. Nine is the end of all numbers, containing the preceding numbers within i ts own sum. It always remains itself when added to itself or multiplied, or subtracted, suggesti ng the fundamental all-inclusive self-sustaining nature of the realm. What is still more important, however, from the scientific viewpoint is that they are things, names, and symbols actually perceived in that sphere by the skryer in the spir it-vision. As a matter of solid proof, one could quote numerous visions and astral journeys obtained by different people in different places at different times, in which all t he traditional symbols appear in dynamic and in curiously dramatic and vital form. Magic, as already remarked, is a practical system, and every part has been devised for experiment. Each part is capable of verification using appropriate methods. Each st udent may check it for himself, and thus discover the realities of his own divine nat ure as well as of the universe both within and without him, independently of what any other m an may have written in books. We ask for experiment; demand it even, for the sake of mankind. We invite the earnest and sincere student to experiment for himself. Sophisticated people, with a smattering of modern psychology, are likely to assume th at Magic discloses nothing but the hidden depths of the Unconscious. They will say th at these journeys are comparable to dream experiences which are referred to the working and dramatizin g power of the subconscious mind. What difference does it make if the Qabalists na med this sphere or type of consciousness the Foundation or Astral World and the moder ns the Unconscious? The terms are cognate, and the symbols interchangeable; both mean the same thing, when all things are considered. If Magic possesses weapons that are more penetrating and incisive than scien tific ones, shall we reject them because Magic is the discredited house where they are stor ed? If magical methods reveal our secret selves more directly, and unlock the vast store of wisdom and power within our souls, showing us how to control them in ways that neither psy cho-analysis nor any modern science has succeeded to do, should we not be foolish to reject its benefit s? Magic is a scientific method. It is a valid technique. Its approach to the univer se and the secret of life's meaning is a legitimate one. If it assists us to become more fami liar with what we really are, it is a Science--and a most important one. And to the scientist, wh ether he be psychologist or physicist, it will open up an entirely new universe of tre mendous extent. CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Mercury (Roman) Thoth, or Tahuti (Egyptian) Hanuman (Hindu) CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE Carl Jung brought the messages of the Gods, and opened the way into the hidde n depths of the unconscious, by writing voluminous collected works on his hermene utic processes. Dr. Leon R. Kass, who has taught philosophy and ethics at the University of Chicago s ince 1976, has long believed that science could threaten the human condition, both b y undermining human self-esteem and by generating tools that might be mis used, particularly by genetically reshaping the human mind or body. Science has become so dangerous, in his view, because it is a powerful f orce, yet one that has been deliberately stripped of moral values by scientists who are train ed to pursue the truth objectively. His gloomy criticisms of biomedical research have led h im, though by a very different intellectual route, to the same restrictive views on man y reproductive issues as are held by conservatives and opponents of abortion. He has opposed genetic sc reening that results in abortion and once called the in vitro fertilization met hods of fertility clinics \"a degradation of parenthood.\" But he has long since changed his mind about in vitro fertilization, a technique that since 1978 has enabled about a million otherwise infertile couples to conceive. He is also at ease with the president's decision to allow some research on human embryon ic stem cells, a policy announced August, 2001 at the same time as his appointment. Dr. Kass's guarded enthusiasm for manipulations of human reproduction have made him the favorite moral philosopher of many conservatives. It has also put him at odds with some of his fellow bioethicists who view him as too willing to see the d ark side of biomedical research and too pessimistic about society's ability to control it. He, in tu rn, has accused them of being too willing to give a free pass to whatever new treatment comes a long. In trying to inject some soul into science, Dr. Kass has found himself setting special value on the natural human cycle of birth, procreation and death. Just as he opposes m ost kinds of interference in reproduction, he is also against deliberate efforts to increase longevity. The proper goal of medicine, in his view, is to improve health, not to conquer d eath, which he sees as a necessary and desirable end. \"The finitude of human li fe is a blessing for every human individual, whether he knows it or not,\" Dr. Kass has written. With medicine's increasing success, he said, \"anything is permitted if it saves life, cures diseases, prevents death.\" Dr. Kass argues that death at the natural time give s meaning and urgency to life and that immortality might not be quite the blessin g it may seem: the new immortals, he says, \"would not be like us at all.\" DIALOGUE WITH HERMES In a dimly lit room, sit with journal ready.

These include such symbols as the"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"tarot trump, THE MAGUS, the color orange, the number 8, and his characterist ic regalia (winged sandals, helmet of invisibility, the caduceus, the four magical weapons--wand, sword, cup and pentacle). Hermes is a mischievous god, so we should be cautious when contacting hi m. If we presume to wield power over this figure of the Magus, the unconscious will react wi th a subtle attack on our ego. It deploys the \"mana personality\" aspect of the magician and he possess es our ego. This is a regression of consciousness. If the ego drops its pretentious claims to victory over the unconscious, then possession of your personality by the inner magic ian will automatically cease. Don't let this inner magician cast a spell over your ego. The trick of interacting with him for a profoundly individual step forward is to confess our weakness in the face of the powers of the unconscious. When we don't opp ose the unconscious, it is not provoked into attacking the personality and we find a n ew \"mid- point\" of experience which unites the opposites of the conscious and subconscious perspectives in a borderland awareness. The hermetic approach to reality is not to take fantasy literally. We must rathe r learn to read the messages and symbols contained within events as signposts on our j ourney into our deepest self. Then we find inner harmony. The true value of the symb ol is not found in analyzing it, but in adding further analogies to the one already supplied by the symbol. Astrologer Robert Hand sheds light on the nature of the planetary Mercur y: On the highest level, Mercury is associated with the Logos or Word, the aspect of divinity in which the will of God is translated into the particular forms and str uctures of the created universe. Occultists have always considered the physical univer se itself to be nothing more than a set of signs or a map corresponding to the divine nature. All knowledge and wisdom come through the Logos , whose symbol is Mercury. Thus, as long as the process of knowing is recognized to be less important than that whic h is to be known, Mercury is one of the highest symbols of all. It is this aspect of Hermes we seek to contact, that which represents l iving Truth, not the lies or illusions of maya, or the shadow reality. When you can imagine Hermes's form i n front of you, greet him and begin discussing your reasons for desiring a cons cious contact with this inner figure. There is generally little trouble in getti ng the figure of Hermes to communicate. After all, words are his forte. Be sure to faithfully record b oth sides of the script. Then reread the dialogue when you are through and record your feeli ngs and reactions to the encounter. HERMES IN YOUR LIFE 1.

I am Artemis, Queen of Night; Silver my bow, swift my flight!"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II: THE HIGH PRIESTESS ARTEMIS (PARADOXICAL VIRGIN-MOTHER) In the Tarot, Artemis is corresponded with both the Path 'Art' in her h untress nature, and 'High Priestess' in her solitary role as Virgin-Mother. In both cases she is associated with the Moon or Lunar Consciousness. She is Queen of the Night, Thea. In Rome she w as Diana, in Egypt Isis, for the Jews Shekinah, to Moslems Sakina, in India Shakt i, Prakriti and Maya, in Scandinavia Disa. Artemis as Virgin-Mother expresses the archetype in its most exalte d form. Paradoxically, she is Great Mother and Immaculate Virgin, the White Goddess. She is a vari ation of Celestial Queen, the deepest mysteries of nature. She personifies pure self-reliant Feminine power, with an esoteric knowledge of visible and invisible forces, med iumistic abilities. She embodies our submission to faith in destiny. She encourages us to seek our ow n mystical experiences in receptivity. She represents our oneness with the universe, our essential \"be-in g,\" with attention to natural rhythms and cycles. Paradoxically, she is Great Mother and simultan eously Immaculate Virgin, containing the entire cyclic process of nature and it s relationship to time. She transcends time, living constantly in a co-temporaneous etern al Now. her paths up the Middle Pillar exemplify the Way of experiential discover y of these mystic truths. Her way is through symbolic and meditational means -- through the se nses and transcendence even beyond the mind, essentially through soul travel. Her Way is the"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Middle Way, in tantric philosophy the opening of the Sushumna channel and t he raising of Kundalini toward the Crown. Union with her is consciousness of primal existential self, and our de epest ecological self. Beneath the layer of alienation from nature which our culture has created lies a deep resource we can tap which is fundamental wisdom about the unity of life. Th e Virgin helps us balance emotions and desires, directing our thoughts toward higher consc iousness. In ancient times she was known as Isis, who exemplified her impenet rable mystery by reiterating that, \" I am Isis; no man has lifted my veil. \" She is bathed in the Light and concealed by it; she is a multifaceted brilliant Solitaire. Thus she all udes to her virgin nature, that sense of wholeness within oneself, which is the source of wisdom. She is the secret powers of nature, Sophia, Shakti, Shekinah. This wisdom is deep ecology which reveals the way of living in balance through intuition. She is the natural Ligh t of the Soul-- illumination. This archetype has reverberated down through history as the sublime mat riarch known as the Great Mother. She is the possibility of bringing creative ideas to bi rth, to manifestation. She contemplates the possibility of various manifestations. The matriarc hies of ancient times reflected societies intimately in touch with seasonal cycles an d natural rhythms. We all yearn for \"the mother.\" For some, this yearning takes a regressive self -destructive turn, which seeks a return to the unconscious oblivion of primal unity through d rugs or insanity...in most cases certainly not a conscious choice. The Great Mother is the All-Merciful one, who understands everythi ng and forgives everything. In our fantasies at least, she always acts for the best, living only for ot hers. The narcissistic personality wants her to exist only for him. And, of course, her great love is never truly understood. If we transmute our personalistic dependenc y on the archetype to a higher octave, we can access the spiritual dimension of this mystery. Artemis is the goddess which represents the moon in its crescen t phase. The crescent shape of the waxing moon symbolizes increasing power, the 'horns' represent growth and fertility. Her chief attribute is that she is a virgin, complete within herself. The mystic remains chaste or virgin in the sense of never being swayed by the events of li fe to give up spiritual aspiration--all other loves are secondary. Her growth is seen as the potential of fulfillment and fertility through fantasy or \"fertile imagination.\" There are two distinct forms of the goddess Artemis. She corresponds with both THE HIGH PRIESTESS (Trump II) and ART (Trump XIV). As The High Priest ess, Artemis as Virgin-Mother, is the mediator of the highest mystical experiences. Sh e is the way to true initiation. In mystical meditation we become receptive to divine grace. He r path reaches through and beyond the great Void, THE ABYSS, to the highest unitive state s of consciousness. Mystical experience connects self-actualization wit h god-realization. She is the link between the archetypal and formative worlds, the matrix of eter nal patterns with unique manifestations. Both THE HIGH PRIESTESS and ART lie on the vertical axis of THE TREE OF LIFE. This vertical axis, known as The Middle Pillar, represents the quic kest, most equilibrated"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Path to mystical attainment. Artemis inhabits the extreme middle pos ition, where the \"medium\" and the \"amazon\" represent poles of a single archetype. She is equivalent to the alchemical Anima Mundi, or World Soul. Artemis bridges our perceptions of the world by stimulating the imaginative faculty. Only a particular facet of woman plays this role of mediator (or medium) to man concerning the mysteries of his own psyche. That woman has a role to play whic h is inherent in her nature. It is not the role of sharing his intellectual i nterests or providing his meals. It is also not becoming the mother of his children nor being his s exual partner. The Artemisian role is to be a mediator to man of his creative inspirations , a channel where the riches of the unconscious can flow to him more easily than if she wer e not present. For women, she inspires also, from a depth beyond that of the \"masculine\" ego-cons ciousness. It takes a high degree of focused consciousness in a woman for her to be able t o observe what she is in fact doing instinctively. It is vitally important for a woman who i s handling these images from the collective unconscious to have a strong ego to withstand the regressive pull of the unconscious. If she does not, she may be lost in the maze of the transcendent imagination, causing confusion to herself and those around he r (sorceress' apprentice). The mediumistic woman is an initiator. If she becomes devoted to a reli gious creed or spiritual science, she will put herself in its service. Alternati vely, she may find herself expressing the spirit of an epoch. In every event, the spiritual woman is me diating archetypal images to consciousness. PHYSICAL FORM Biologically, Artemis might be seen as corresponding with an important e ndocrine gland-- the Pituitary. As a master gland, controlling the others, the function of th is gland is to regulate sex, reproductive cycles, and lactation. It also secretes serotoni n, an important \"trigger\" to the diverse states states of consciousness. Serotonin inter acts with noradrenelin in the \"pain-pleasure\" cycle mediated by neurotransm itters in the brain. Artemis is that element which allows images or visions from these altered states to be brought back into a daily context. She may be imagined in the symbolic relation ship between the pituitary and pineal glands. Her \"magickal son\" is the light-s ensitive pineal body or \"Third Eye. This gland is implicated in the production of endogenous MDA, dubbed the Spirit Molecule (Strassman); it is responsible for th e intrinsic perception of Light. This third eye is also implicated in the raising of Kundalini, the serpent power, responsible for awakening inner sight or in-sight. There are three great stories in science. One of them is where the u niverse came from. One of them is where life came from. And the third is where we came from. We crave a deeper meaning to life, a more imaginative understanding of the mystery of existence . And out of that One Mystery, we have created many ( E Unus Pluribum ). Who are we; why are we here; where are we going? How did we get here; what is the mind for; why is it so big? How does the mind work; how do we know what we know? Why should the pur ely subjective aspect of experience exist at all? Why do we wonder?"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Science readily admits there are many unsolved problems. Aspects of hum an transformation and subjective consciousness and where it comes fro m are deeply mysterious. In exploring these questions, science is not seeking to kill soul, but rather to provide an arena for imagination to systematically explore the realm of Spirit. Traditionally, theology itself is the science of God and his works while systematic theology is the systematizing of the findings of that science. Three new sciences are now vividly rooting our mental processes in our bi ology, our seamlessly welded psychophysical self. Cognitive neuroscience attem pts to relate thought, perception and emotion to the functioning of the brain's electrical, magnetic or metabolic signals. A second science, behavioral genetics shows there is a fascinating d egree of specificity in our genome. Any adaptation is for the good of the genes which made t hat adaptation. The third science connecting mind with biology is evolutionary p sychology which concerns why we have developed certain naturally-engineered organs connected to our brains. Western science has traditionally considered matter as primary, but if you look at what the mystics report, you can also say that it's ultimately consciousness and awarene ss that are primary. Science has penetrated the quantum level of observation where e vents \"function\" as the source of a continual \"creation\" that sustains the universe at every i nstant. This has forever blurred any falacious distinction between mind and body (psyche and soma) or energy and matter. Our consciousness emerges from the un-conceptualizable ground of exi stence as a tangled hierarchy of self-similar nested levels that contain a \"strange loop\" wh ich leads to the unexpected result of inevitably bringing us back to our starting point. It i s a model in which transcendence seems necessary. It brings up another question , \"Dare I explore my inner world?\" To explore or not to explore is a question we face every day. Who am ong us has not wondered what we would find if we began an earnest probe of the depths of our own being? \" In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true either is true or becomes true within the limits to be found experientially and experimentally. These limits are beliefs to be transcended. \" --John C. Lilly Yet, few of us have peered deeply into the fundamental operations of the in formation- processing system we call \"the mind.\" Our normal waking consciousness is but one special type of consciousness; sleep and dreams are another. There are other mode s of conscious and subconscious experience that can enrich our lives. Visions, white li ght and the nirvanic raptures of religious ecstasy have been invested with ultimate value and de voutly sought. In exploring this field we are touching one of evolution's fundamental mechan isms of survival, for it is by knowledge that we orient ourselves in the world. Accurate know ledge of our two worlds--the so-called real world and the inner world--correctly inf orms us of the conditions we must cope with. The scientific search for knowledge is the search for Truth and Beaut y, appealing to both spirit and soul. To know facts is to survive; not to know, or to assess one's envir onment wrongly, is to lose the fight for survival. With the examination of the sources, natu re, and"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"accuracy of our knowledge, we begin to develop epistemic awareness , a more informed understanding of what we know and don't know. We are faced with two seri ous epistemological problems: (1) How can we determine which facts are true ? and, (2) How can we determine which facts are important? Our minds are the compar ator and interface between the internal and external realities we navigate through. Research suggests that some people may be genetically or temperamentall y predisposed to mystical ability. Those most open to mystical experience tend also to be open to new experiences generally. They are usually creative and innovative, with a bre adth of interests and a tolerance for ambiguity and may be fantasy-prone and tend to dissociate. Over - rational, controlled individuals will probably resist the experience. I n mystical experience, the content of the mind fades, sensory awareness drops out, and you are left on ly with pure consciousness which does not need an object. It is not a mere byproduct of s ensory action. Brain scans of a large sampling of people lost in prayer or deep meditation reve al certain common neurological underpinnings which correlate with religious st ates from transcendence, to visions, to enlightenment and feelings of awe. Attention in the frontal lobe is indicated by activation in this area of the brain during meditation. Whe n the parietal lobes quiet down, a person feels an expansive oneness with the universe or cosmic unity . For a mystical experience to occur, brain regions that orient us in space and mark the distinction between self and world must go quiet. In order to feel that time, fear and self-consciousness have dissolved, cer tain brain circuits must be interrupted. Which ones? Activity in the amygdala, which monitors the environment for threats and registers fear, must be damped. Parietal-l obe circuits, which orient you in space and mark the sharp distinction between self and world, must go quiet. The orientation area requires sensory input to do its calculations. Inten se meditation blocks the brain from forming a distinction between self and world. Frontal- and temporal-lobe circuits, which mark time and generate self-awareness, must disengage. Wh en this happen what we think of as our 'higher' functions of self hood appear briefly t o drop out, dissolve, or be deleted from consciousness. Our response to religious words is mediated at the juncture of three lobes (parietal, frontal and temporal) and governs reaction to language. The \"voice of God\" probably emanates from electrical activity in the temporal lobes, important to speech perce ption. Inner speech is interpreted as originating outside the self. Broca's area, responsible for speech production switches on. Stress can influence one's ability to determi ne origin of a voice. The right anterior cingulate turns on whether a stimulus originates in the environment or is an auditory hallucination. Hyperarousal by sensory stimuli, such as drumming, dancing or incantations, can am plify emotions and send the system into hyperdrive. The equilibrium of the h ippocampus is overwritten, inhibiting the flow of signals between neurons. Certai n regions are then deprived of neuronal inputs. When the orientation center is isolated wi th ritual and liturgy or meditation, the boundaries of the self begin to dissolve. Sacred images are generated by the lower temporal which also responds to ritual imagery and is facilitated by prayer and meditation. Religious emotions originate from the middle"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"temporal lobe and are linked to emotional aspects of religious experience, s uch as joy and awe. Yet neural correlates don't mean that these experiences exist \"onl y\" in the brain or are merely illusory; they are associated with distinct neural activity. Th ere is no way to distinguish if the brain causes these experiences, or is actually perceiving spiritual reality. Religious mystics the world over make a common assertion: no one can underst and a profound religious experience until he has himself experienced it. N o amount of description with mere symbols can touch or reveal its true meaning. Schopenhauer on ce remarked that \" The exceptional man is like an archer who can strike a target other cannot, the gen ius is the one who can strike a target others cannot even see .\" The individual who lacks awareness of the depths and facets of the psyche is something less than whole, and cons iderably less that he could be. He is living a single-dimensional existence in a multidim ensional psychic universe. Theology has been defined as the science of God and his relations to the un iverse, (Thiessen, 1979). In the realm of systematic thought, the facts concerning God an d his relations to the universe lead to theology; in the sphere of individual and c ollective life, they lead to religion. In other words, in theology we organize our thoughts concerning G od and the universe, while in religion we express in attitudes and action the effects these thoughts have produced in us. Both theology and philosophy seek a comprehensive world and life view, echoin g the ancient dictum to \" Know Thyself .\" Theology does not merely begin with the belief in the existence of God, but also holds that he has graciously revealed himself. The t heologian is irresistibly driven by God and the revelation he has made of himself. The pos sibility of theology grows out of two things: the revelation of God and the endowments of man , which are of two kinds: mental and spiritual. Revelation is the act of God which discloses himself or communicates truth to the mind, and makes manifest that which could not be known in any other way. It may occur i n a single instantaneous act, or extend over a long period of time. This communication and experiential Truth may be perceived by the human mind in varying degrees of fullness. These subjective experiences are the basis of primordial mysticis m. God reveals himself and we are capable of apprehending spiritual revelation, which is immane nt in the Creation, nature and our nature. That which is known about God is evident w ithin us, for God makes it evident to us. Paul wrote, \" Since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature have beeen clearly seen, \" (Rom. 1:20). History shows that the religious element of our nature is just as univers al as the rational or social one. Religion or a belief system is categorized as one of the universals i n culture. There are in man's belief everywhere, various forms of religious phenome na and awareness of the supernatural. Believers feels the existence of God is also necess ary, in the sense that we cannot deny his existence without doing violence to the very laws of our nat ure. If we do deny it, the denial is forced and can only be temporary, just as the pendulu m of a clock can be pushed off center by an internal or external force but will return to its original position once the pressure is removed. The \"normal\" belief in God or a spiritual f orce tends to return when we are not consciously under the influence of a false philo sophy."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Assuming that God has revealed himself, we ask next, how does man come into pos session of this revelation?

It is a consciousness that notices similarities and unifies, rather than se parating and fragmenting. This state of mind manifests as a deep ecological connection with the uni verse, a merging of the environmental self and the transpersonal self. Modern women have reflected the split in consciousness fantasized i n our contemporary, work-a-day world. With society emphasizing the superiority of logical (or mascu line) forms of consciousness, women experience a tension. The tension is between t he opposites of feminine thoughts and its values, and the more dominant paternal style. Art emis reminds us of the values of the \"natural mind,\" or being-in-soul and thereby suff used with spirit. Artemis is the connection which mediates between the personal and collective aspects of life, between actualities and the beyond. She bridges the individual conscious horizon and the primordial realm of the imaginal with its images, ideas, figures, emot ions, and beliefs. The feelings which are developed through this \"soul-making\" are more impersonal. There is a detailed sensitivity to the specific worth of psychic contents and attitudes. She keeps women in touch with the innermost core of their being, and does the same for mystical man. Artemis can act as a soul-guide for men through the anima, his feminin e component. In Tarot, THE HIGH PRIESTESS represents a very high inspirational deve lopment; the anima for men. She relates him to the superconsciousness, like a muse . If a woman can live up to the promptings of her masculine side, she can become a very spirit ualized and developed person by balancing the opposites within. She is the \"patron saint\" of the meditative, philosophical, or deeply religi ous personality. Artemis mediates wisdom by urging participation in the realm of mythic al perception. These metaphors of perception are always images. She stirs up the imaginati on to quest, chase, and muse. She inspires the interpenetration of soul and intell ect. Mystical experience is remembering ourselves, most perfectly. In self-realization, there is blissful merging of the personal consciousness with the Universal. As a medium, Artemis is psychic (sibyl) because her intuitive facult ies are strong. Her subjective experience of time is discontinuous. She has the ability t o experience possibilities as being more real than the present moment. She glimpses the future and manipulates the present toward that vision. The importance of the present depends on its effect in the realizati on of a specific future. An experience is important if it suggests or fulfills visionary sight. Ti me is not as important to her as the bright picture of possible futures, from which to draw ins piration."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"As a moon goddess, Artemis symbolizes the instinctual nature which work s through emotional reactions. But THE HIGH PRIESTESS represents a spirituali zation, purification, and refinement of the powers of the instinctual nature . The instinctual movement is toward the spirit in ourselves--the mystic quest. The gr eat feminine principle in all of us is receptivity. Our irrational, changeable nature is expressed as emotional moods. Moods may be destructive but if understood, can lead to a better and more productive li fe. Understanding and dealing with the rhythms of nature, knowing how to live with them, and deal with them is essentially feminine. Both sexes can become aware of polarities w ithin themselves and understand their behavior and functions so they can be used for higher s piritual aims. V. Ramachandran asserts he has found a \"God Spot\" or a \"God module\" in the brain: a location in the brain that is responsible for human religious experience . Atheists began to assert that the research had proven all religious experience was simpl y the product of the brain. For the other side, some religious leaders (including the Bish op of Oxford, apparently) read the findings as suggesting that God had put a special recept or in the human brain. Frankly, there are times when his writing invites such spe culation. Overall, however, his description of the Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) pat ients’ reports is cautious. These reports deal more about religious experience than with God per se : \"They have an aura, they feel the presence of God, or they make statements that sound r eligious— not necessarily, ‘I see God,’ but some say, ‘Suddenly the whole universe makes sense to me, I feel enlightened, I see deep meaning in everything.’ The syndrome, whic h may also manifest itself as general hyper-emotionalism, hypergraphia (writing p age after page of detailed and spirituality-obsessed diaries), and a compulsion to use r eligious language, is known well-enough by neurologists to earn its patients the descrip tion, \"temporal lobe personality.\" Ramachandran hypothesizes that the emotional intensity that some TLE p atients experience may be a result of a strengthening or \"kindling\" of certain neural pathways between the temporal lobe and the amygdala. The amygdala is a part of the limbic syst em that regulates or filters emotional connections that we make with person s and things that are of significance to us. Those who have had repeated temporal lobe seizures apparently have even more i ntense experiences when they encounter something meaningful to them. They t end to interpret everyday occurrences as having extraordinary meaning, and they often have heightene d responses, particularly, to things religious. Ramachandran elaborates, \"Someth ing has happened in their temporal lobes that heightened their response to re ligious terms and icons...There may be a selective enhancement of emotions conducive to r eligious experience.\" The question remained whether the enhancement of religious experie nce was a part of a general heightening of emotional responses, or something more selective . To test the question, he asked two religiously inclined TLE patients to observe a vari ety of images and words while he measured their galvanic skin responses. To his surpris e, he discovered that these patients actually showed a reduced response to certain images (th ose having to do"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"with sex), but a heightened response to religious words and images. One inte rpretation of this finding is that \"there are neural structures in the temporal lob es that are specialized for religion and spirituality, that are selectively enhanced by the epilep tic process.\" While he resists any suggestion that his findings are religiously reduct ionistic or should be interpreted as either for or against the existence of God, he does speculat e about the relationship between these brain pathways and our religious experienc es: \"Could it be that human beings have actually evolved specialized neural circuitry for the sole purpose of mediating religious experience?\" Or, as he said in a later interview, \"Ther e may be certain neural pathways—neural structures in the temporal lobe and the limbic system—whose activity makes you more prone to religious belief. Now why this would happen, I don’t know. One possibility—and this is very speculative—is that human beings are hard-wired for religious beliefs.\" Ramachandran’s research is interesting and tends to uphold the asser tion of a connection between the limbic system (particularly the amygdala) and religious exp eriences. There is no explicit application or insight here into religious ritual. At one point he muses how the galvanic skin reaction test might be used by religionists: \"One wonders whether this technique could be useful as a sort of ‘piety index’ to distinguish reli gious dabblers or frauds (‘closet atheists’) from true believers. The absolute zero on th e scale could be set by measuring Francis Crick’s galvanic skin response.\" Specific keywords associated with Artemis are: anima beaming bliss calm compassion contemplation conscientious crystal diva dreaming meditation moon mushroom pale passive patience peaceful quiet remembering sensitivity serene sibyl silver spinster sympathetic voyage wise old woman woman's intuition waiting INTELLECTUAL IDEA THE HIGH PRIESTESS is an inner experience.

At the last moment we must give up ou r aspiration, becoming receptive and quiescent, so the Light makes its way through us. The feminine aspect of nature brings forth a child through the mystery of birth. This child may not be human, but the result of a creative conception. It may be the resul t of a moment of genius--a poem, painting, idea, or discovery. The child is incubated in the silent womb of the goddess, protected until the moment of emergence. First comes a union of opposites, then a period of quietude and gestation, nurturing and withdrawl. Then t he birth of genius, the result, the child. When an individual has undergone the required initiations, or gained a prop er relationship to the feminine principle, Self mediates the flood of imagery from the unconscious. Artemis gives it value and meaning from her perspective as The High Priestess of in spiration. This is the highest incarnation of the feminine principle in its function of spirit, ordivine knowledge. In Christianity, this role is filled by the Blessed Virgi n Mary, and in Gnostic sects she was known as the Sophia. She is an inner daemon whose acquaintanc e brings awareness of the ultimate reality of our own natures. She bestows an experience of immortality by lifting us from the daily time frame into a sacred realm of metaphorical perception. This adds a sacred dimension to l ife's events. The moon goddess, in her crescent phase, is Virgin in the psychological se nse of the word. In ancient times, the virgin was distinguished by the fact that she was not dependent on what others thought. She was no slave to conventional behavior. Rather, she was motivate d by contact with her core Self, the well-spring of her being. Being true to herself, the Artemisian woman feels no need to capture, pos sess, or conciliate a husband. Even in marriage, the role she plays expresses her own fierce ind ividuality. She bears her divinity in her own right, not as merely counterpart to man. Virginity is an inner attitude which may seem unconventional, but it is t raditional since it is concerned with gaining a right relationship to the goddess. Its values come f rom our deep interior processes, not external dictates. Motives are misplaced if th e only result is development of a headstrong egocentricity. Thought in its widest sense is a constructive process utilizing inte rnal representations, and so is inner spiritual life. These representations may be visual images , speech images, or musical images, even scents, which classically are reported in spirit ual experiences. Thus consciousness is a self-organizing, emergent property of living organisms. The ability to construct internal representations of sensory stimuli , which underlies perception and cognition, is also an emergent property. Viewed objectively, i nternal representations are perfectly concrete entities, even though we can 't yet characterize them precisely. But internal representations also have a subjective aspect: i n certain situations we are aware of them. Consciousness is central to being and directly acces sible by intuition. But it is not beyond perception; it is the very stuff of perception."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"In 1979, Charles Laughlin and d'Aquili wrote The Spectrum of Ritual , which was elaborated upon by d'Aquili and Newberg in The Mystical Mind, (1999). They assert that ritual accomplishes two important biological feats: 1) coordinating the ne ural systems and functions of ritual participants into group action, leading to a sense of u nity among participants, and 2) entraining and transforming the structure of neuromo tor subsystems in developing individuals. The imperative toward ritual arises in the interaction in the brain of t he left frontal lobe and the left orientation area, which forces us to look for causes in any chain of events; to create meaningful narrative stories about experience. What really maintain s the force and persistence of religious ritual, however, is ineffable experience, the intense positive affect experienced by participants. D'Aquili and Newberg propose that certain religious practices can so s timulate the body's calm system or its flight system that activity in the related brain circu it starts to \"reverberate,\" while simultaneously shutting down ever more of the oth er system. Depending on whether the ritual is fast (as in the spinning dance of S ufi whirling dervishes) or slow, as in Zen meditation, different parts of the brain are activated, per ceived by the mind as a higher state of consciousness. Within the brain, the autonomic nervous system regulates and adjusts base line body function and responds to external stimuli. It consists of two mutually i nhibitory subsystems: the sympathetic or arousal system and the parasympathetic or quiescent system. The arousal system is the source of our fight or flight response, and i s connected to the adrenal glands, the amygdala, and reaches into our left cerebral hemisph ere. It is sometimes called the \"ergotropic\" system because it releases ene rgy in the body to react to the environment. The parasympathetic or quiescent system (sometimes called the \"t rophotropic\" system), on the other hand, conserves energy, promotes relaxation and sleep, and maintai ns basic body function and growth. It includes the endocrine glands, parts of the hypot halamus and the thalamus, and reaches into the right cerebral hemisphere. Although this material is highly complicated, the most important relationships to keep in mind here i s that the dominant (analytical) mind is connected to the arousal system and involves the amygdala, an d the non-dominant (holistic) mind is connected with the quiescent syst em and involves the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Psychologist Roland Fischer (1967) developed a map of inner space and states of consciousness based on the dynamics of the ergo- and trophotropic systems . He postulated that all knowledge is innate, being an interpretation by the cerebral cor tex of sub-cortical information. He contends that each level of arousal contains certain types of in formation which one can “know” only at that level. This is similar to other theories of state-related learning and memory, (Tart, 1975; Rossi, 1986). Fischer also postulated that at extreme levels of hyper- or hypoarousal there i s a paradoxical shift from one physiological system to the other, automatically. He d eclared boldly that the extremes in either direction create mystic experie nces of the Self, which are"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"interpreted either as an experience of the Plenum (hyper-arousal) or the Void (hypo- arousal). Fischer summarized his theories by creating a consciousness map, a 'Cartogr aphy of Meditative and Exalted States.' Increased states of arousal were graphed to t he left of center (which indicates “normal awareness”), while increasing tranq uility was mapped to the right. Movement of an individual’s consciousness to the Left brings i ncreasing motor excitation, while that to the right brings almost total lack of sensory input. In Fischer’s own words: “What I propose is that normality, creativity, schizophrenia, and mystical st ates, though seemingly disparate, actually lie on a continuum. Furthermore, they repres ent increasing levels of arousal and a gradual withdrawal from the synchronized physical-sens ory-cerebral spacetime of the normal state. Specifically, there is a retreat first to s ensory-cerebral spacetime and, ultimately, to cerebral spacetime only. The gradual withdrawal from physi cal spacetime is an expression of the dissolution of ego boundaries, that is, the fusion of object and su bject, and it implies that an existence solely in spacetime is an oceanic experienc e, the most intense mirroring of the ego in its own meaning.” In summary, we can see that for any individual perception of the universe (as Self or mind) can occur as an internal or external experience. It is our rich internal exp eriences that have puzzled researchers in consciousness as the so-called “hard problem” of consciousness. At the extreme parameter in either direction, we experience an encoun ter with the Absolute. Along the continuum, we may experience varying forms of an I-Thou dialogue unit ing extremely hyper- or hypo-arousal states. Hyperarousal, or mania, may result from psychoactive drugs, or a bipolar or schizoph renic episode. It results, sometimes in “ego-death” when the “I” becomes so fr eaked-out it submits or gives in to the sensory overload which overwhelms it. Hypoarousal leads to a characteristic state of silence or emptying when the ego voluntarily subm its to unification of subject and object, of “I” and Self. In either case, cortical and subcortical activity become indistinguishably merged; there is no separate “I” left to perce ive an objective reality. Thus, dualism is obliterated. Paradoxical physiological mechanisms operate in the body under most condit ions to chemically prevent the attainment of higher states of arousal on either en d of the spectrum. They function somewhat like the switchover from arousal to repose which oc curs at the point of orgasm. But it is possible, with repeated exposure to the paradoxical s ituation to function effectively at higher levels of arousal. In fact, there is always a complementary component of the opposite arousal s ystem functioning even in the mystical state. If there were no ergotropic aro usal in mediation, for example, we would fall asleep. Thus in some sense, our task becomes falli ng asleep as much as we can while remaining awake. REM sleep, or the dream state, is another exa mple of physiological paradox where there is extreme cerebral excitation coup led with little muscular activity."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"We can characterize the physiological condition of an experience of the Self as remaining trophotropically relaxed while ergotropically alert. The mystic achieves h is goal when he learns to short-circuit the homeostatic mechanism of negative feedback . The negative feedback system perpetuates the experience of duality between the “I ” and Self. D’Aquili and Newberg outline \"four basic categories of arousal/quiescen t states that may occur during extraordinary phases of consciousness\": The Hyperquiescen t state; the Hyperarousal state; the Hyperquiescent state with Eruption of the Ar ousal System; and The Hyperarousal State with Eruption of the Quiescent System. In addit ion they propose a fifth state where both systems are maximally aroused, the absolute unitar y state (AUB). The Mystical Mind , 25-16; see also d’Aquili and Newberg, \"Liminality, Trance and Unitary States in Ritual and Meditation,\" Studia Liturgica 23 (1993):2-24. D’Aquili and Laughlin report research that shows that when either the arousal or quiescent system is maximally stimulated it results in a \"spillover effect\" or a stimulation of the other system. That is, experts in meditation may experience a \"rush\" or a release of energy during a hyperquiescent state. From the other side, those who engage in rhythmic rituals that engage the arousal system, such as energetic dancing and singing, m ay experience states of bliss, tranquility, and oneness with others. Hyperar ousal and hyperquiescent states seem to stimulate the limbic system, which regulates our emotions. Hence, these states are experienced as being emotionally intense, and often pleasurable. In summary, in states of very high activity around one circuit, there can be a \"s pillover\" such that the dormant system activates and goes \"on line\" simultaneously wit h the other. Although rare, this dual state can lead to a sense of \"tremendous release of e nergy\" that may feel like \"oceanic bliss\" or absorption into the object of contempla tion. And in extreme cases there is a \"maximal discharge\" of both systems, induci ng brain activities perceived by the mind as the Absolute Unity of Being or AUB, wh ich brings the abolition of any discrete boundaries between beings, by the absense of a s ense of time-flow, and by the elimination of the self-other dichotomy. A mystic in the AUB s tate will experience either a divine being, such as God, or the cosmic void of Nirvana, de pending on whether there has been a predominantly ergotropic or trophotropic involve ment. Yet we cannot reduce religious awe, numinous vision or mystical experience to merely a neurochemical flux. It is also during these \"spillover\" experiences that the paradoxes prese nted to the brain through myth become resolved by the simultaneous functioning of both hem ispheres of the brain. In ritual stimulation of the arousal system, for example, the present ation of what is an unresolvable logical problem in the left brain (the wafer is both bre ad and the Body of Christ), is experienced as unified in the holistic operation of the ri ght brain. Ritual participants therefore may experience a resolution of the probl ems presented by the myth and a deep unity with other participants: \"The simultaneous str ong discharge of both parts of the autonomic nervous system creates a state that consists not onl y of a pleasurable sensation, but, also, under proper conditions, a sense of union with con specifics and a blurring of cognitive boundaries.\" Similarly, those who engage in meditation may report"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"that they experience resolution of paradoxes during some meditative state s, hence the famous use of such paradoxes by Zen practitioners. Both meditation and ritual can lead to the spillover effect and the simult aneous discharge of the arousal and quiescent systems. But they come at the experience f rom different directions. Meditation begins with the quiescent system and by its hy peractiviation can achieve spillover into the arousal system (from trophotropic to ergotropic ). Ritual approaches from the opposite system (from ergotropic to trophotropic). Bu t there are other differences as well: The difference between meditation and ritual is that those who are adept at me ditation are often able to maintain an ecstatic state for prolonged periods of time. The ecstatic state and sense of union produced by ritual are usually very brief (often lasting only a fe w seconds) and may often be described as no more than a shiver running down the back at a certain point. This experience, however, may be repeated at numerous focal points during th e ritual. Furthermore, the ecstatic states produced by ritual, although they ar e usually extremely brief, seem to be available to many or most participants. The ecstatic s tates attained through meditation, although they may last for hours or even days, requ ire long practice and intense discipline. 31 So ritual is more accessible and effective than meditation for large groups of people as a system for stimulating both hemispheres of the brain and thereby bringi ng mythic conundrums to resolution. In The Mystical Mind , d’Aquili and Newberg elaborate on the difference between these approaches, describing a complex continuu m of unitary or mystical states that may arise from different types of ritual or medit ation, but the basic principles remain intact. Ritual is here described as a \"bottom-up\" technology for activating the autonom ic systems; its rhythmic qualities stimulate either the arousal or quiescent systems that then affect the higher brain functions. Slow rhythms in ritual, like chant and read lit urgy, primarily stimulate the quiescent system, while rapid \"driving\" rituals i nvolving loud noise and body movement stimulate the arousal system. Either approach may lead to a \"filling up\" of the autonomic system and then a spi llover effect and an altered state of consciousness. Slow ritual may lead to a hyperqu iescent state and a feeling of peace or unity, and occasionally result in a spillover into the arousal state or a sense of profound energy. Similarly, fast ritual may provoke a hyperarousal state of attention and intention, sometimes spilling over into the quiescent s tate and a sense of bliss. They hypothesize that ritual could theoretically lead to the maximal disch arge of both systems, causing hallucinations, mystical visions, or a state of Absolute Unitar y Being (AUB). Finally, they note that marked ritual behavior tends to draw the att ention of the amygdala, as does strong smell, which may be the biological source of the experience of religious awe. Ritual actions and the presence of incense may help neurologi cally for ritual to promote altered states of consciousness in its participants.

The \"Third Eye\" gland is implicated in the production of endogenous MD A, dubbed the Spirit Molecule (Strassman); it is responsible for the intrinsic perception of Light. This third eye is also implicated in the raising of Kundalini, the serpent p ower, responsible for awakening inner sight or in-sight. The key to a successful meditation is th e withdrawal of the sensory currents to the eye focus or the third eye. Once there, it re quires a constant gaze into the middle of whatever is lying in front of us without any dist ractions of thought. The monumental work of Dr. Rick Strassman focuses on the role endogenous che mistry plays in creating spiritual life.

Its primary source, the pineal, has traditionally been refer ed to as the Third Eye. DMT production is particularly stimulated, according to Strassman, in th e extraordinary conditions of birth, sexual ecstasy, childbirth (also corresp onded with Artemis as mid-wife), extreme physical stress, near-death, and death , as well as meditation.

They also are c haracteristic of a fully psychedelic DMT experience. How might meditation evoke the pineal DMT e xperience?\" \"Meditative techniques using sound, sight, or the mind may generate parti cular wave patterns whose fields induce resonance in the brain. Millennia of human trial and e rror have determined that certain \"sacred\" words, visual images, and mental exercises exert uniquely desired effects. Such effects may occur because of the specific fields they generate within the brain. These fields cause multiple systems to vibrate and pulse at certain fr equencies. We can feel our minds and bodies resonate with these spiritual exercises. Of cours e, the pineal gland also is buzzing at these same frequencies. . .The pineal begins to \"vibrate\" at fre quencies that weaken its multiple barriers to DMT formation: the pineal cellular shie ld, enzyme levels, and quantities of anti-DMT. The end result is a psychedelic surge of the pineal s pirit molecule, resulting in the subjective states of mystical consciousness.\" (Strassman, 2001). Strassman (1990) has suggested that the pineal gland is a possible source of endogenous hallucinogens and this gland is also associated with sleep cycle rhythms , and traditionally with mystical states of consciousness. Besides the production of melaton in, the pineal may synthesize endogenous hallucinogens in response to certain psychophys ical states, and raise serotonin levels in the brain.. These hallucinogens may belong to the tryptamine or beta-carboline famil y of compounds. One compound (6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydro-beta-carboline) has been proposed as the producer of rapid eye movement sleep. It is concentrated in the retin ae of mammals which may be related to its visual effects. There are several ways in which either psychoactive tryptamines and/or b eta-carbolines may be produced within the central nervous system (and possibly withi n the pineal) from precursors and enzymes that are known to exist in human beings. In additi on, nerve fibers leave the pineal and make synaptic connections with other brain sites th rough traditional nerve-to-nerve connections, not just through endocrine secretions. Serotonin or tryptamine levels are higher in the pineal than any other organ i n the brain. 5-methoxy-tryptamine is a precursor with hallucinogenic properties wh ich has a high affinity for the serotonin type-3 receptor. Gucchait (1976) has demonstrate d that the human pineal contains an enzyme capable of synthesizing both DMT and bufot enine-like chemistry. These compounds are prime candidates for endogenous “schiz otoxins,” and their production may be related to stress and/or trauma, and has been impli cated in the etiology of schizophrenia. Strassman notes that both the embryological rudiments of the pineal gland and the differentiated gonads of both male and female appear at 49 days. Melatonin is a time - keeper for gonadal maturation and/or competence so the pineal is implicated again. He suggests this may be the ontological source of the tension between sexual and s piritual energies. The pineal gland, as source of both psychedelic compounds and t he gonads,"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"source of physical immortality, may work in concert (or oppositon) in the ind ividual’s development through time. Stress-related hormones are implicated in pineal activation to activate n ormally latent synthetic pathways, creating tryptamine and/or beta-carboline halluci nogens. When we face stress or potential death, or in meditative reveries, we “tune back” i nto the most well- developed motif of such experiences--the birth experience. Peri natal themes and memories re-emerge. Those with Cesaerean deliveries report greater difficulty in attaini ng transcendent states of breakthrough and release during drug-induced states. Maybe less fetal ( or maternal) hallucinogens were released at the time of birth. They may not, according to St rassman, have a strong enough “ template of experience ” to fall back on, to be familiar enough with to let go without fear of total annihilation, because lesser amounts of pineal h allucinogens were produced during their births. The pineal may be modulated in its activity by meditative practices, to el icit a finely-tuned standing wave through resonance effects and other techniques. It crea tes the induction of a dynamic, yet unmoving, quality of experience. Such harmonization resynchroni zes both hemispheres of the brain. Dysynchrony is implicated in a variety of disorders. Such a standing wave in consc iousness can induce resonance in the pineal using electric, magnetic or sound e nergy, and may result in a chain of synergetic activity resulting in the production and release of hallucinogenic compounds. Thus, the pineal may be the physical representation of an attractor, or “light ning rod” of consciousness. Pineal function may profoundly affect consciousness at th e time of birth, death, near-death experiences, and during unusual psychophysical states such as shamanic or psychotherapeutic experiential journeys or meditation. Kabbalalists speak of this light in relationship to the ecstatic entr y into Pardes. Literally, it means \"orchard,\" but is the name for practice of Kabbala in the four worlds . The \"orchard\" is the Garden of Pomegranates, the spheres of the Tree of Life . It is not a philosophical concept, but a metaphysical experiential tru th. Having nothing to do with intellect, it is the experience of supreme light. This exper iential Light is called the \"Light of the Shekinah,\" and this links it with the qabalistic asce nt up the Middle Pillar and with the High Priestess path. The intense radiance of the Divine P resence is greater than the full light of the sun, and can be overwhelming or blinding to those t oo weak or ill- prepared for it. In this state the soul remains covered or adorned, and one cleaves to the Light. I t is direct gazing at the radiance of God ( Tzvi ha Shekinah ), a light so strong that no one can bear it. It's characteristic is a great desire to cleave, as described in medi eval texts. There is no idea of love, only of awe. The intensity of the experience is linked with a great de sire to cleave to the radiance of the Shekinah and a strong experience of union with the Di vine."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"According to Kabbalist Idel, this is the result of a desire to enter and b ecome part of the divine realm. There is an attempt to enjoy the Divine without interru ption. The language of desire implies erotic overtones to the experience, especially sinc e \"Shekinah\" in Hebrew is feminine, to cleave to a feminine aspect of the Divine; the \"sweet radi ance\" has erotic overtones. It is also the mystical death of the pious ones whose souls are separated from al l concerns with the mundane world, and who cleave to the supernal world. It is not an acc ident, but an achievement and grace. There is a three-fold structure implied on the Tree of life by three paths up the Middle Pillar -- the direct mystic \"highway\": f irst the via purgativa , then a via illuminativa , and finally a via unitiva . It is more than an interpretive paradigm of the soul dying and not returni ng because it reaches a great attainment out of intense love. The cleaving is total, the soul and the Light become one entity of original essence. It is a unio mystica , bridging in a total manner the gap between man and God. And we can extract from the sources a method and a prac tice, but not without the help of a Master, to reach the extreme and yet return. The Divine Light attracts the light of the soul, \"which is weak in relat ion to the Divine Light.\" The metaphor is one of magnetic pull, a non-traditional metaphor which attempts to come to terms with personal experience of a soul immersed in this l ight. According to Idel, the Kabbalists tried to reach the pre-fall state of the Primord ial Man, to enter again the radiance of the Shekinah, and even to enter a certain erotic relations hip with the Divine Presence. You see the radiance of the Divine Presence on those worshipping out of love , each according to rank with the expectation of a corporeally observable radiance -- a gl ow. For the Kabbalists, Paradise and Pardes were corporeal, sensuous, erotic, se xual and an object for practical striving. The Kabbalistic tradition is not one of speculations about mysticism; it is a full-fledged mysticism. An extreme type of experience is sou ght out and considered positive. The mystical death is the real goal of ecstatic Kabbalah, and for thes e ecstatics, extreme experience is final experience. However, there are inherent dangers mentioned in Jewish hermeneut ics. The Divine is not affected by the entrance of the philosopher or mystic into the Pardes f or it affects only the human soul. But in the Theosophical paradigm it does have affects on the non-h uman realms, the system of divine powers, influencing the relationships bet ween them. In the Theurgic paradigm there is an influence on, or struggle with, the demonic r ealm, which seeks to hold the soul back from union. The Divine and demonic share a common anthropomorphic structure. Hen ce, the Spheres are prototypes for both the Divine and demonic realms. Both paradigms seek to af fect the structure and relationship of external entities, either by insuri ng harmony in the Divine world or by combating some aspect of the demonic. In both cases, Pardes represe nts a danger zone, leading potentially to insanity or death, this realm being too strong f or most mortals. Premature entry to this realm has been likened to tearing a silk scarf from a rosebush, rather than gently removing it slowly (with regular meditation)."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Ecstatic Kabbalists seek to induce or re-induce the harmony in the Di vine spheres, disturbed by primordial human transgression, separating one aspect of the divine from the rest.

CHAPTER III: THE EMPRESS APHRODITE "},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Aphrodite is the well-known goddess of love, beauty and seductive power. Sh e is the pure erotic impulse, pure libido, pure imagination, fertility, fruitfulnes s. The Hollywood love- goddess is a modern icon of her eternal power. She inherently possesses t he qualities of grace, charm, and desire. She is a goddess of passion as well as pleasure, sen suality, affection and sensitivity. She can manifest as artistic and aesthetic in spiration, the desire to give birth to something remarkable. There are pleasures and dangers in her enchanting attentions. Aphrodi te inspires a compelling, subjective state. Euripides called love the \"breathes (o r blasts) of Aphrodite.\" She seeks intimacy, touching the most private aspects of our lives. Aphrodite is linked with many lovers in different myths. In one version of her life, Aphrodite was married to Ares. So we see that when we are well acquaint ed with the Ares principle of physicality, we have an encounter with the sensuous ene rgy she represents. In another myth, Aphrodite is said to be the wife of the lame smith Hephais tos. In this story of adultery, Ares is her paramour of choice. Aphrodite derives her warmth from a golden, sunlit type of sexuality. Sh e has the greatest degree of solar qualities in her personality; whereas the other goddesses have greater lunar consciousness. This solar affinity does not, however, mean that she possesses a superior st yle of consciousness where self-awareness is concerned. In fact, she can te nd to drift into situations with an aplomb only possible through reckless disregard for the future. Aphrodite can be the source of envy arising from a pulsating desire for life and love. The origin of Aphrodite is a peculiar image for the Goddess of Love, since she stems from the violent castration of Uranus by Cronos. Her birth from the severed genit als of Uranus symbolizes genetically the relationship of this goddess to her father, an d by extension with all men. She is the embodiment of both his cynicism and his phallic sexual imperative. She is the drive personified in an alluring image. Sexual desire and amorous pleasure function as aphrodisiacs which lead to fulfillment through union of male and female. Aphrodite is an embodiment of the union o f opposites wherein the lovers are annihilated. Venus is a binding force, which may app ear as a voluntary involvement or with the strength and dynamism of possession. The paradox of Aphrodite is that she is a loving and passionate wife, but always leave s open the possibility of exploring numerous relationships with gods and mortals. She is always friendly and intimate, except to those who would usurp her p osition. In her, both love and power drives are embodied in a single goddess. PHYSICAL FORM Aphrodite is physically embodied in sex organs, orgasm, and aphrodisiacs (See THE MAGICKAL AND RITUAL USE OF APHRODISIACS , Miller). Finding the god in a disease, she expresses through the aptly named venereal diseases, those se xually transmitted afflictions."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Her major motivation is the non-rational procreative urge. It functions th rough the glands on an instinctual level, producing pulsating physical desire. She herse lf can become possessed by the passion she arouses in others. She can even take over the b ehavior patterns of other Olympian gods, most of whom aren't immune to her charms. But in her desire and longing she can be persuasive, deceitful, or conni ving. She is always the potential lover of anyone she befriends. Aphrodite is considered a very as sertive, active goddess, constantly mobile and advancing. But when she can't make immediate , personal contact with the object of her desire, the emotions of longing or yearning f or the absent beloved are part of her emotional affect. When we are love-sick, she has inspir ed it. She inspires not only passion, but also hate, rivalry, vanity, and jealousy. These per ils of Aphrodite, the results of unfulfilled desires, show the ambiguit y of her gifts. When Aphrodite manifests as emotional assertion, there is a compulsion to act out her dynamic will in daily life. She is a multi-faceted goddess intimately linked with life (procr eation), love (passion), and death (longing for the departed lover). She is associated with nakedness, s pecial costumes, the artful use of cosmetics and other aids which come under the headin g of \"the arts of love.\" These include courtship and lovemaking. By personifying a transcendent image of the seduction of mortals by a goddess, Ap hrodite mediates feelings of immortality to the human from the divine. This is the oceanic experience of timelessness in orgasm. She joins nature and culture by using love as an artform. Her well-practice d skills are continually complemented by her attitudes, sentiments, and moral values . She promotes an aesthetic lifestyle which declares boldly that we should take our fil l of love, where and with whomever we desire. Of course, if we do, we had better be ready to suffer t he consequences. Good sex and good foods have always paired well together, whether a sumptuous banque t, or merely a delicious tray of fresh fruits and nuts. The art of kissing pr obably stems from mouth-to-mouth feeding. Even in current studies, sexual responsivene ss in women is possitively and significantly correlated with their general positive att itude toward food and eating. Like sex, you should take time together when eat, slowly, relaxing and n ot rushing things. It takes a full 20 minutes after a meal is through for the body to real ize it is full. To ritualize a meal is to lend grace and style to the action of eating. It is a way of or ganizing the experience for the greatest satisfaction of all the senses; prese ntation of the food is important to the eyes as well as palate. Soft music will help slow us down and fill our auditory sense. Of course, too much food can make us feel bloated and we need to d igest before rushing into sexual activity. Some people prefer fasting for a time bef ore ritual sex. Emotional symptoms that affect our attitudes and energy in bed may be part of a m etabolic problem and may be curable through simple dietary measures. The anxiety re action, most common of the \"bedroom problems,\" occurs when the medulla part of the adre nal glands responds to emotional stress by pumping out adrenaline, which in turn rai ses blood sugar"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"to get the body ready for action -- but sometimes it overdoes it, increasing blood pressure and heart rate. The body releases adrenaline to help you cope. An outpouring of adrenaline is the body's corrective mechanism for falli ng blood sugar. Many people get panic attacks for no apparent reasons, and this may be caused by low blood sugar. You may get cranky before you get panic attacks. Such a reaction is hypoglycemic. General health influences sexual health. The condition o f our nerves, blood, arteries, heart, muscle tone, and digestion can greatly determine our abil ities in bed. Sexuality is not just in the gonads. It permeates every cell in our bodies. On a very practical level, Aphrodite is embodied in aphrodisiacs and their e ffects. The quest for some pill or potion that guarantees better sex or more intense orgas ms is as old as mankind's experience of sex. Whether these prescriptions work or not i s often a mute point. Since much of our sexuality is psychological in nature, even the promis e of enhanced performance may work wonders. An aphrodisiac might have a variety of effects on either male or female partic ipants. Some of these include producing erection in the male, stimulation of the ge nitals or nervous system, relaxing inhibitions, augmenting physical energy, strengthening the sex glands, or preventing premature ejaculation. Aphrodisiacs can either increase sexual appetite or ability in the user . They affect the organs and the sex glands. Some may act as placebos, since the the primary eroti c organ is the brain. Whatever increases pleasure is an aphrodisiac, including nerve stimulants. They have been used by priests, priestesses, and sorcerers since antiquit y to instill love and stir up lust, along with traditional love potions. Some real aphrodisiacs and tonic s include yohimbe, kava kava root, saw palmetto, ginseng, fo-ti-tieng, black American willow bar k, cactus flowers, damiana, and guarana seeds. Aphrodite is a goddess not only of fertility, but also of a fertile imaginat ion. There is no sexual organ more important than the human mind. There is no physical and ment al experience more ecstatic and blissful than a complete sexual union between two loving partners. There are no anaphrodisiacs, dampeners, or desexualizers worse than ignoranc e, fear, or anxiety regarding the quality and effectiveness of one's sexual performance . The greatest sexual tonic for us is physical and psychological health so that we can spontane ously respond with depth. Sex is not mere lust, even if lust is sex. It transce nds the two major animal functions and enters the realm of the cultural and spiritual, prom oting feelings of love, consideration, and solicitude.

While doing this imagine a sacred sphere of glowing yellow that surrounds you a nd extends out from you. Bring forth all feelings of warmth, charm, like-ability and fri endliness to everything within or near this circle. Imagine a crowd of people, perhaps off to the side or in front of you, that automatically feel warmth, kindness and magnatism towar d you and you feel that toward them. This is your sacred circle that you will work wit hin and it will be carried with you through this ritual. Imagine anyone within its influenc e will turn likable and you will like them.

Do this by imagining the god form and all it's/his/her posi tive qualities are moving through you. If you don't want to invoke a deity then you can invoke a person real or imagined who has the qualities you want, such as invoking or identifying with the Spirit of James Bond when it comes to talking to women. Head out into public. Treat each action of meeting, greeting, welcoming and talk ing as a sacred act that must be done with massive friendliness.

The present-day Aphroditic woman is easily recogniz ed. A stereotypical form is the Hollywood sex goddess who stimulates the desire s and imaginations of millions. This is the very image entertainers such as Madonn a, J-Lo, and Angelina Jolie have come to exemplify. She is the fantasy-lover of any whose imagin ation she stimulates. This is the type of allure and beauty which produced classic romances --the Queen of Sheba, Delilah, Cleopatra, and Helen of Troy embodied many of Aphrodite's qualities. H elen made the egotistical error of feeling superior to the divine archetypal Qu een who made her pay for her vanity. Aphrodite's libido or energy should be recognized as a dynamism and domain that is not to be challenged competitively. She brings life's mystery with her, and mor tals can never possess her fully. Comparison of Psyche's beauty in the tale of Amour and Psyc he initiated her cycle of trials and tribulation, by which Aphrodite sought to destroy h er for her pride. The Aphroditic woman of today is characterized in Jungian literature as a he taira (Latin for she-wolf), or companion to man. She appeals to him generally through reflect ing his personal anima, or unique idea of his \"perfect woman.\" This attraction inclu des seduction, flattery, and inspiration. She awakens a man's perception of latent talents, most of which he will never have the capacity to develop, since his energy is bound up in pleasing her. She embodie s the dual capacity to delight and lead astray. She can awaken not only desire, but also resignati on and despair. She appeals to him consciously and subconsciously. She can be a phys ical, intellectual, or spiritual companion simultaneously. With little or no regard for the future, her perception of time is discont inuous. So is ours, under her influence, as lovers we feel \"suspended in time.\" Theref ore, each moment must be experienced anew, irrespective of past commitments or consequen ces. Duration is not valued as highly as the intensity of immediate experience. Importance is attached to experiencing intensity of sensation and gratification. The sense of searc h and urgency for freedom compel Aphrodite to new affairs. The hetaira seeks unity, but brings disruption when it arises in us . She is no respecter of roles. We see her in the student who falls for the teacher and vice versa . She intrudes in the consulting room of all professionals. She forces her attentions on the marri ed person, and makes employer fall for employee. She seeks friendship, if not overt se xual contact with members of the opposite sex. This alone can be disruptive to a formerly self- sufficient couple. When a person is dominated by this impulse for sexual desire and union, we usually call them playboys or playgirls (when older, dirty old man or woman).These male or fem ale"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Don Juans are typically high flyers. They are impulsive, energetic, enthus iastic, and suggestible. They seem to lead an exciting, free life, spontaneously realiz ing their whims. Changing from partner to partner, these people play a terrible price by ete rnal role- playing to the companion of the moment. They can't form real relationships o f any duration because they are in love with their own shape-shifting project ions. Life has no continuity, rather the person is always soaring off hither and yon to fulfil l yet another fantasy of ideal romance. Because we are \"spacey\" under this influence, we transmit a quality of t imelessness which fascinates by challenging our borders and limitations. Many innovative artists are of this archetypal dominant. They live close to the archetypal domain of the subconsciou s and may have mystical tendencies. They are adventurous explorers, and seek the \"r ush\" of dangerous situations. Those with this drive toward \"fatal attractions\" eventually come to recognize the compulsive quality of their elan vital. Then they become guilt-ridden and have shame and anxiety for their promiscuous behavior. This results in depression, or de speration because of the inner weakness of an impulsive borderline personality disorder. Wh at they need is to stop trying to live in the realm of total possibilities, accept some boundar ies and commit themselves to something or someone. Another pattern of loving is represented by Aphrodite's kindred, the e nchantress Circe. She is a hetaira, or she-wolf, or colloquially \"a bitch.\" Her style uses the p owerfully divine love sorcery. Unfortunately this means she compels or manipulates others i nto loving her for her own selfish ends. In a direct, balanced love encounter, both power and love are balanced. Circe dis turbsthe balance with love magic, which is her way of arousing love through power, rather than the spontaneous awakening of love which has power over both of the pair. Circe is t hus a predator. She is imaged as continually circling on the perimeter of the human world. From her borderline world she can transform mortals, just as Persephone tran sforms them, through a death-like regression to an ugly, animalistic creature, full of viol ence and dark passion. She is the ultimate \"fatal attraction.\" The ancient Babylonians had a ritual of sacred prostitution where each woman was required to serve as a temple harlot once in her life. Through this servi ce she received the highest honor and no social reproach. Through this impersonal sexual act, she s ubmitted to her instinct, and renewed her virginity in the sense of being one-in-h erself. She recognized her psychological virginity and received the revelation of l ove as distinct from desire. Each woman required personal experience of this phenomen on in order to be redeemed. Some people might be pursuing contact with these life-givin g symbols today, through both profane and sacred channels. The ritual of Aphrodite has moved from single's bars to the health club, to w herever safe or unsafe sex can be found. When one was in the ancient temple, those who cam e to be renewed by Aphrodite's sacred prostitutes were frequently the dr egs of the sexual pool;"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"those who were impotent or could find no one else for themselves. Accep tance of sex with someone based solely on availability has an archetypal background.

Internally, it indicates a profound relationship to that which has beauty , an aesthetic appreciation of the highest order. Externally, it means extending ourselves t oward the object of our desire with love and abandon--following our \"Bliss.\" Aphrodit e not only engenders, but enlarges life. Rapport is an empathetic or sympathetic relation or connection with anot her. It is experiencing the world through the same portal as the person you're commu nicating with. Rapport doesn't require understanding. Sharing rapport is like jumpin g inside another's nervous system and suddenly understanding the way they make sense of realit y. Rapport is the ability to bond instantly with others. In rapport like attracts like. R apport reverses the axiom that opposites attract. When the initial challenge of opposite attraction wears off, we're left w ith someone who thinks, acts and behaves unlike what we consider the norm. Consequen tly, that means someone who will mostly be out of sync or rapport with us. Look no further for th e cause of broken relationships. If you are involved with someone and a good part of the time you don't understand eac h other, you are out of rapport. And if you are out of rapport, the chances of your relationship surviving are slim to none. In fact, the duration of your relations hip may be a testament to your persistence and grim intention. If you happen to fall in love with a person with whom you have no rapport, you are in a no-win situation, destined for failu re. If you want to love someone who see things differently, or you want to sell yourself or your ideas to those whose maps of the territory are not in alignment with yours, you will have to do something you never consciously did before. That is, create rapport with t hem by being like them. People have rapport with others because of the reflection of themselves they perceive. When we \"fit\" well with someone we are more at ease than with someone wh o is incongruent with us. We must relearn our communications strategie s so that we relate to others in a manner that fits their map of the world. That is what rapport i s all about, (Brooks, 1989). Rapport is the foundation of successful, unencumbered comm unication. It is essential to being an understanding and empathetic partner and an e xciting and satisfying lover. Empathy in tantra occurs through the immediate 'pairing' or 'coupling' of t he bodies of self and other in action. Through our mirror neurons we are paired in the biological d epth of empathy, at the level of passive association of living bodies of self and other i n embodied action. At the level of intentionality and conscious mood-matching and emu lation and participation mystique we participate consciously in the tantric proc ess.

Nevertheless, romantic love is a notion which build s certain expectations"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"and follows certain patterns. Romantic love began with the medieval Trou badours and their tradition of courtly love. It has so permeated our culture that it is s een as one of the most desirable forms of possession by an archetypal power--that of being \"i n love.\" This is the same type of love which we say \"is blind.\" This is the type of love that places the beloved \"on a pedestal\" through the projection of our own anima or animus. When we project this element of ourselves onto anoth er, we experience an exaggerated adulation of the beloved with a blind eye toward th eir negative or shadow side. They become our all, and our attitude toward them has a syrupy glamour . Call them what you will (Heloise and Abelard, Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Is eult) the \"star-crossed lovers\" is one recurrent theme of the goddess. They are always with us in literature, movies, and real life. She is golden or fair, and he is her ideal image of masculinity. They share the fantasy of romantic love, reinforcing the delusion of specialness. Paradoxically in th is specialness we live out one of the most common patterns from the repertoire of mankind . Courtly love idealizes the beloved in a semi-divine manner. We make our si gnificant other a demigod. The lovers virtually worship one another. They yearn for one another whe n parted, and fate seems to separate them invariably. These notions of courtly love as the ideal of fulfillment in human life sti ll pervade our culture and produces tragic consequences in daily life. When we projec t our anima oranimus onto mere mortals, our inflated expectations are shattered. Thi s results in despondency, grave disappointment, disillusionment from romantic f antasies, and sometimes divorce court. The tragedy of romantic love is that it is a hindrance to mature love. The projec tions of idealized romanticism are based on one's inner life, and prevent us f rom truly knowing our partners. Also, romantic love tends to try to perpetuate itself \"when th e thrill is gone,\" by moving from partner to partner. The Greeks realized that no single partner could contain the power of an ima or animus indefinitely. That is why they saw the divine archetypal power of love as a godde ss of great force and beauty. The great stories of literature which concern this type of romantic love u sually involve a complication which keeps the lovers apart, much to their dismay. By this mechanism they are prevented from really knowing one another in depth. The fantasy image s grows in strength through reverie and yearning for the beloved. There is no concrete experience to contradict the idealized image. So the projection remains always \"out th ere\" and is never seen as fascination with an aspect of oneself. The concept of \"soul mates\" is an everyday belief concerning fated or romanti c love. Every soul is complete and whole in its own potentiality. There may be no true soul mates, except in the sense that those to whom we may readily attach our projections seem to \"f it the bill.\" No partner can live up to the lofty conception of the projected anima or animus . This higher aspect of the soul should be given due consideration and attention f or itself."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Romantic love has an escapist quality and is strongly addictive, much like a dr ug. It may temporarily feel good while dulling our awareness and severely limiting our potential. Love is an exciting, intensely pleasurable stimulation which we seek int ently. It can become an artificial, self-contained experience when activities, other friend ships, and growth potential are sacrificed for its momentary bliss. Unless we are prepared to deal with our personal weaknesses directly, love may become a negative emotional involvement which can never satisfy our psychological inse curity. It results in rejection, deprivation, and dissolution, even possible suic ide. If constant exposure to a person is necessary to make life bearable, there can be no real romance, b ecause of the constant threat of withdrawl. Addictive lovers use others as objects of their gratification. They seek to p ossess people only to fulfill their neurotic need. Love is the opposite of this misuse of attachment. It is based on the desire to grow and expand and for the beloved to do the same. Addictive lovers are not secure in the belief in their own value. They der ive self-esteem from the lover's inflated view of them. Addictive lovers aren't necessa rily improved by their relationship and tend to drag one another down. They can be toxic for one anoth er, yet be compulsively attached. They reject other meaningful relationships in sacrifice to the belove d. They retreat from the world into a fantasyland. They are possessive and jealous of each other's ou tside interests. They rarely remain friends once they split up and the enc hantment is lifted. Addictive lovers may have successive or simultaneous affairs, which are n ever satisfying enough. As with drug use, an addictive lover may develop a tolerance to the beloved, an d seek excitement elsewhere. The constant craving is never satisfied,b ecause it is a dissatisfaction with our own inner self. Love is used a temporary escape from feelings of inadequacy. Some relationships reinforce neurotic patterns in one another throu gh forming a consensus of two, \"just us against the world.\" This mutual brainwashing, or folly of two, is a mutual illusion which can confirm any fantasy, while inner fortitude remains u nchallenged. Breaking free of these neurotic patterns is as hard as kicking undesir able habits, and requires conscious attention and continual work. It requires a sense of self esteem, joy and competence, getting involved meaningfully with other people in an unsel fish manner. Aphrodite is also the passion in committed love, and also represents ma ture love. It is a form of psychological grounding, which reshapes our motivations, and teaches ne w methods of coping with disappointment in life. When we can find true satisfaction in wider life context, we needn't substitute one kind of compulsive relationsh ip for another. We can meet others realistic expectations and make reasonable demands as resp onsible, reliable adults. Addictive love compels us to deny our past in favor of an unknown ecstatic f antasy fulfillment. Mature love is grounded in the here and now, and lacks the n eurotic compulsive quality. True love compromises, endures, comforts, satisfi es, relaxes, is"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"consistent, and unselfish. True love is a value system which places the hi ghest priority on mutual feelings of respect, responsibility, and follow-through. A lover m ust first know their deep self and be honest about inner feelings. Aphrodite has a place in Hera's realm of marriage as the highest moment for husband and wife--the pleasure of love. Hera partakes of Aphrodite's enchanting tric ks for the celebration or consummation of her wedding. When Aphrodite rises our of t he sea we are transported to a transparent, bright and pure dimension. The opposites are d issolved into unity. The paradox of the Goddess of Love is that she originates from the castrated m ember of Uranus, which also engenders the revengeful, vindictive Furies. Neve rtheless, she represents the mystical splendor of love, the most celebrated yet least understood of emotions. Like Hermes, the Hermaphrodite, Aphrodite can exhibit a bisexual aspect ; then she is considered a god-goddess. She embodies the golden purity of male-female whol eness emerging from the union of opposite but complementary halves. Her primal m agic is an enchanting deception which contains eternity in its depths if not in its duration. Her touch is warm and genuine, nurturing like the rays of the sun. As modern people, we recognize the old Greek spirit most easily when w e are captivated by love, for then we surely believe in personal deities. As we become enti rely obsessed with a passionate desire for the physical presence of our beloved, we feel like a p owerful force holds us in thrall. Love is a unique emotion which transcends the needs of security and grati fication, becoming an end in itself. We all need love. Love expands us in unpredictab le directions and can puff us up to unpredictable proportions. Mature love is an exchange of energies, a giving and receiving which is not necessarily a 50-50 proposition. We can experience the warm feelings of love even at a distance far removed from t he object of our affection. Visualization of the beloved, thoughts of endearment, or the l oved-one's name all evoke pleasant sensations, and arouse yearning. This is also the princ iple of Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of love. The lover yearns to search out the beloved. The goal is participation, proximity, belonging, and finally union in which the emoti on of love is experienced intensely. Mature love has three major aspects: 1) it outwardly directed from lover to beloved; 2) it is inwardly directed in that the attraction emitted by the lover is recipr ocated from the beloved; and, 3) it is reflexive in that \"being in love\" is an inner psychic e xperience which has value for the individual lover in his own personal growth cycle and well-be ing. he offspring of love is joy, which is experienced as that sense of well-b eing flooding the body and soul. There is an increase in energy and spirit, making life's bur dens easier to bear. It prompts feelings of adequacy and capability, without inflating th e ego. Joy has the capacity to expand into the psychic spheres of others."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"But, alas, all love relationships are not so immediately rewarding, even if they are compelling or compulsive. Aphrodite, herself, was involved with many Gods and mortals in varied and convoluted relationships. Hers is a complicated group of myths involvi ng at various time, Area, Uranus, Poseidon, Hera, Artemis, Athena, Eros and Psyche, and Priapus. She could be ardent as with Ares, unfaithful as with Hephais tos, or jealous as with Psyche and Helen of Troy. Love is not limited solely to human purposes, but is an archetypal dynamism of it s own. It is not an end in itself, but a means to return our souls to the mythic dime nsion. It also brings that mythic dimension into daily life. We can experience our own imagi nal essence through the power of live. It is one style of emotional fantasy or divine madnes s. Through love we learn to weather the bad and the good times. We come to accept th e beloved for their real nature, both positive and negative. We must also accept t he possibility of being wrong, and accepting that, and admitting it. We must lear n how to accept freely what is given by the other, and reciprocate in an appropriate m anner. This requires discrimination, keeping expectations realistic, and disappoi ntment at a minimum. True love is not so blind, just acceptant.

It may seem odd that the same physiological act can raise us to the heights of spiritual exaltation or plunge us into guilt- ridden misery. The awe-inspiring force of desire and sex has played a role i n religion, magic, mysticism, occultism, symbolism, and the whole spectrum of human psychobiological interaction with the transpersonal. Creation myths are oft en about divine couplings, and cyclic fertility rites dramatically reenact this ori ginal creative act. In magical theory the opposites which exist at the universal level also exis t in us as microcosms or miniature copies of the universe. Each of us as human beings contains all the opposites, symbolized as male and female, sun and moon, conscious and uncons cious. In balancing and reconciling these opposites we achieve a higher unity. In mar ked contrast to"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"the general religious suppression of Eros, tantra does this by glorifying our erotic and sexual nature. Sexuality is a sacred ritual of union through the sensual and ecstatic cel ebration of differences. It is the life force. Through the sexual act we seemingly tr anscend our isolation and physical boundaries, share in a greater reality. We discover, if only momentar ily, that the Other seems to become part of oneself. Hence, the erotic language of mys tics describing the apprehension of ultimate Unity, the promised reward God offers t he righteous. If this search for the Beloved is the major sexual goal, and if it can be gained on ly partially and fleetingly with a human partner, then it is quite natural to think of the lasting and blissful union of the soul with God in sexual terms, as many mystics h ave done. This concept of the soul's union with God as a sexual union is paralleled in the r omantic ideal of love with a human partner as an act of worship. The overwhelming nature of desire leads us to experience it as a supernatural force. The soul abides in the heart of t he flesh. In the ecstasy of sexual union we rise to the supernatural level, are possessed b y a male or female deity, and mingle with the divine. Orgasm corresponds to the soul's ecstasy p ossessed by God. Tantra is a path of maximally arousing or filling up the senses creating a true voluptuousness through poetry, imagination, eroticism, sexuality, trance, halluc ination and exaltation. By honoring the sensual self, the metaphysical nature of surrend er to the erotic impulse is experientially revealed. How can we escape from the prison of self-obsession? Real love is quite di fferent from desire, infatuation, lust, or concepts of romance. Real love means self-tr anscendence through mutuality and reciprocation, service to self, others, and world. Ultimately, the refinement of sacred sexuality practices is an artist ic expression, a form of creativity, even private performance art. It is a celebration of life and an end in itself. You might think the practice of Tantra requires a lot of preparation and props, bu t ultimately it only requires you to bring your naked authenticity to the process and be spont aneous. Enjoy the virtual experience of being Shiva/Shakti. Learn the virtues of e rotic education, of sacred sexuality and how to create that atmosphere and inner focus. There are both Eastern (Tantra, Taoism, Persian) and Western (Goddess wor ship, Alchemy, Courtly Love, Sex Magick) traditions around sacred sexuality. Eastern enlightenment comes in many varieties of spiritual experience and pr actice. They all express the pursuit of the One, or the One through the infinitely Many f orms of existence, which are actually only different forms of sacred Emptiness. Tantra pres ents the ultimate Nondual reality as the sexual embrace of God and Goddess, of Shiva and Shakti, of Emptiness and Form. Neither Ascent (Transcendence) nor Descent (Immanence) is fin al, ultimate or priveledged: like yin and yang, dominance and submission, they generate and depend on each ot her. They find their own true being by dying into the other, only to awaken together, c onjoined in Bliss.

When we experience t his in our own awareness, this union is the Nondual vision. God and Goddess, Emptiness an d Form, Wisdom and Compassion, Agape and Eros, Ascent and Descent -- perfectly and bli ssfully united. The God of the Ascenders is otherworldly, usually monastic, ascetic, seek ing to flee the Many and find the One. It is purely transcendental, and pessimistic about finding happiness in this world, shunning time in favor of eternity. Ascension is generally a via negativa , dampening the senses and strictly channeling internal perceptions through emptying, devotion, or concentration. In the other approach practioners of Descending find the divine embrac e through the Many. It is in love with the visible, sensible God, and sometimes Goddess. I t is a God of pure embodiment, of pure immanence, fascinated with diversity, and fin ds its glory in the celebration of diversity. Great variety is the goal of this God. It celebrates t he senses, and the body, and sexuality, and earth. It is creation-centered spirituality wh ere All is divine. Emptiness and form are not-two. Emptiness is the immanent ground of all For m. Tantra is perhaps the oldest form of Eastern alchemy. According to tantric philosophy the whole universe is built up of and pervaded by basic forces which are i n intimate and intricate union. These forces, named Shiva and Shakti, are personified as male and female deities. Of this divine pair, Shiva is the subordinate one, for it is the Fe male Principle that ultimately underlies all manifestation. There is a tantric saying, \" Shiva without Shakti is a corpse. \" The core experience of Tantra is revelation of its sexual secrets. Sexual un ion symbolizes the quintessence of the elements. Sacred sex reveals eternal truth an d transcendence. It is a way of redemption -- union of the personal self with the transpersonal S elf. The Diamond Body is the crystallization or stabilization of the archetype of the universal Self as a permanent part of the individual psyche. Tantra is a philosophy, a science, an art, and a way of life in which sexual ener gy is consciously and creatively utilized. The hidden potency of the sexual act is the blueprint or seed of all creatvity. When we understand the practical teachings of Tantr a, a whole new perspective and experience of life opens. Tantra is a process that foster s the holistic harmonization of the male and female elements of our psychobiological self, am eliorating the war of the sexes. Through rapport and empathy we come to understand the Oth er. Empathy needs a face! Devotion needs a face. Psychologically, there is a harmonization of the inner-mate archetypes of Anima and Animus , soul-figures which function as guides to deeper regions of the psyche. T hey lead to wholeness, integration, self-actualization. In Jungian psychology a man's inne r feminine self is termed anima or soul; a woman's masculine component is called animus or spirit. Their merging creates a psychological and spiritual androgyny, another express ion of wholeness.

This implies drawing closer to the con sciousness of one's authentic individuality, in contradistinction to the active conscious pe rsonality. We can achieve a form of sacred marriage with the inner mate, known in alchemy as the coniunctio . This union produces a Magickal Child that symbolizes our potential for realization of the Higher Self, self-actualization. These western alchemical goals and procedures paralleled Eastern alch emy, with its concern for the elixer of immortality and the extraction of spirit from m atter and its liberation through meditation. Chinese alchemy is a mixture of alchemy, ku ndalini and tantric yoga. Its secret is the great creation of a golden fetus which repr esents the seed of enlightenment. The Chinese view is that every individual possesses a central core th at is an aspect of the universal Tao. In the Tao, the principles of opposites yin and yang are united. Sp irit and soul together make up the personality and vie for supremacy. The goal of Chinese alchemy is to free the spirit from its entanglements with instinctive dri ves and emotions by providing a place in the human body where the primal spirit may crystalliz e and gestate. The beginning of creativity is called prenatal, (undivided yin-yang). Personal spirit is joined with transpersonal spirit and soul then reu nited. The product of this union is called the Golden Flower or the Elixer of Life, literal ly Golden Ball or Golden Pill, which ensures the survival of the individual after the death of th e body. \"Circulation of the Light\" refers to repetitive cyclical mixing of spirit (psychic ) and soul (physical) energies, of the the positive and negative principles, to create the \"yellow bud\" or \"mysterious pearl.\" Through a coniunctio , inner copulation of positive and negative \"crystallization\" occurs as the appearance of inner light, white like moonlight. In the next step, the r esulting light is reddish yellow. The union of the two lights produces the immortal seed . Golden light within the white light between the eyebrows means primal spirit is formi ng the immortal fetus and the Elixer of Immortality. The primal spirit emerges from the fetus an d leaps into the \"great emptiness\" through the gate at the top of the head, forming an indes tructible Diamond Body. In sex magick, the same is known as the Babe in the Abyss (of the Transcendent Imagination). In magical theory a sexual working will not succeed if the aspirant is sw ept away in the thundering surf of desire and orgasm. When partners are in balance, neith er strives for pleasure independently of the other. Mastering the force we have aroused , we can direct it at an objective, such as enhacing integrity, clarity, and wisdom. The element of pleasure is secondary; any idea of shame is banished. It is a means to the goal -- sacramental significance, not the goal itself. In Virtual Tantra, there's no Reality, only perceptions of flowing proces s-- and refined perceptions can enhance the ecstatic state for unique expressions o f self-fulfillment and spiritual experience.

Coniunctio is an alchemical term symbolizing the unification of opposites, like yi n and yang unite in the Tao.

This royal marriage of the Alchemist and his Soror Mystica , the King and Queen, sun and moon energies is a transcendent symbol of the self and emb odies psychic totality, or wholeness.

Sex is the single strongest intensive , euphoric, even hallucinatory natural emotion alterant available, channeling the sexual ener gy into a mystical process of self-development. It is the foundation of Tantra. The spectrum of tantric practices includes not only sexual trance, but p hysical culture, breath control, superconcentration, mental and spiritual discipli ne, and the mystic arts. Much like Western magic, tantra employs candles, incense, bells, magical wands and chalices, spells, magic circles or mandalas, bodily postures, occult gestu res, symbolical designs, and words of power. These are employed to enhance and bring bodily functions under the control of the will and exert a subtle inner alchemy. There is a hermetic distillation of a quintessence from the bodily fluids which reinvi gorates the physical body. Tantra works within the natural cycle of ergotropic and trophotropic proces ses, governed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. They mediate cycles of arou sal and calm, and are therefore implicated in a variety of mystical experiences and also d isorders which display states of hyperarousal and hypoarousal. They are mediated by the neurotransmiters noradrenalin and serotonin. The interhemispher ic balancing mediates the harmonization of the left and right hemispheres of the brainmind.

CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS Venus (Roman) Hathoor (Egyptian) Astarte (Phoenician) Ishtar (Babylonian) Freya (Nordic) Lalita (Hindu) Xochipilli, Tlazolteotl (Mexican) DIALOGUE WITH APHRODITE We all experience the personal aspects of Aphrodite as love and lust, and all forms of sensual pleasure. Neither men, women, nor the gods were immune to the charms of this goddess. In women she appears as the irresistibly attractive \"other woman ,\" mistress, flirt, or gold-digger. She creates the Don Juan type of personality. More positively she manifests in the deep physical and spiritual love between spouses, and in the pe rfect host or hostess, socially. In projection, she appears as that other whom we find irresistibly attrac tive and sexy, despite social sanctions against such feelings. Through invasion or posses sion, we become that magnetic personality. Those who act out her promiscuity expose thems elves to the dangers of various venereal diseases, including aids, legacy of the sexual revolu tion. By ceasing to identify exclusively with this archetype, we can dialogue with h er in active imagination. She can inform us of the subconscious aspects of our relationshi p to our own sexuality. Aphrodite is one of the most active and pleasantly aggressive of th e goddesses, so she is easier to connect with than a remote goddess, like Artemis. When anima is projected in the physical world, she appears in three stage s of development: 1) naive or elementary, 2) manipulative flirt, 3) conscious or inspirational. Ap hrodite corresponds with the sophisticated manipulator, she uses her sexual ity to get what she wants--that is her script and game. She is no innocent thing,unaware of the devastation her charm can wreak. She knows what she has and uses it to her advantage at every chance . She is dark, full-blooded and passionate. When we are unconsciously identified with her we are controlled by h er unconscious power motives. Someone may lure us into an enchantment by being very charming at fir st. Perhaps the aim is immediate sensual gratification, or worse, aiming to disr upt a marriage. This type then uses seeming indifference to make themselves mo re desirable. They use wiles"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"and tricks to attract another's attention, gifts, and strokes. They deliberat ely exploit the anima/animus projections of another onto themselves, using it for person al advantage. This is the motivation of the flirt. In an egotistical identification with Aphrodite, a person becomes a lady-k iller or man- killer, the stud, sex kitten, gigolo, whore, or other role-bound image. The stre ngth of the identification depends on what others archetypes are at work in the sou l. For example, a strong Hera aspect would constantly be urging toward marriage rat her than remaining as mistress or philanderer; Athena would caution consid eration of the implications on career of promiscuous behavior or reputation; Artemis w ould move us to be more modest and pious if not chaste. On a more pragmatic level, Artemi s might say that to steal another's man violates the sisterhood all women share. Considering the various aspects and manifestations of Aphrodite, think b ack over all the ways she has entered your life over the years, creating pleasure or leaving a trail of pain. Remember your sexual awakening, first love, your rivals, attention-getting gambit s. Consider what areas of your life are in disharmony with her principles, or where you may have identified with her too exclusively. Consider how your attitudes tow ard sexuality may have changed over different periods in your life. Sitting quietly in a dimly lit room with your journal open, visualize any of the f amiliar images of Aphrodite or Venus from sculpture and paintings of the maste rs. Alternatively, she may take a modern form as an admired actress or actor whom you think is irr esistible, but this mortal form could never carry all of the archetypal potencies, so it is best to work toward visualizing a traditional forms. You may also use a Tarot card such as THE EMPRESS, which corresponds with her. Greet her and begin discussing those questions that are unresolved re garding your physical and aesthetic passions. Then let her speak about any subconscious patte rns she may know about you. Be careful--she may try to seduce you or use her wiles in any numbe r of ways. She will guard any attention you shower on her jealously, unless your inform h er about certain aspects of your mortal life. Let her know your human limitations and your ethical standards within which she must learn to operate. She is passion pers onified. APHRODITE IN YOUR LIFE 1.

CHAPTER IV: THE EMPEROR"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"ATHENA Athena is a goddess who presents us with a vision of calm majesty with an inves tigative mind -- the domination of intelligence over passion. Her political astute ness shows in her capacity for wise rulership or administration. She embodies a wide range of ac tivities which revolve mainly around the practicalities of city-life in its organizat ional aspects. She teaches us respect for authority and leadership, learning to act in a kingly m anner. She is thus the spirit of civic pride and cultural awareness. She is an ambitious executive, familiar with power. Embodying both spirit and intelligence, she also presides over the domain of higher education, universities or academia. On an even higher arc, she represents the inspiring power of divine wisdom, or Sophia. From the historical perspective of ancient Greece, Athena was originall y a patroness of the fortress-palaces of the Minoan and Mycenean cultures. From these s he derived her traits as protector of the household, and teacher of handicrafts including weaving an d spinning. She may have originally been a variation of the Mediterranean mother-goddess whos e virginity was periodically renewed. Eventually she became a symbol for pe rpetual maidenhood, reserving herself for almost exclusively mental pursuits. She shares virgin- goddess status with Artemis and Hestia. When the Greeks came to the Mediterranean, they probably brought their Valkyrie-like martial maiden goddess with them. She was promptly amalgamated with t he local goddess into a composite figure. In unstable times the protector of the household needed to be practical on the lines of defense.

She fosters the re flection that aims at certain victory. She is the spirit of achievement, competence, and action in the world. St rength, courage and worldly wisdom are not exclusively masculine attributes. She gets us out there to win and gives us the heart to do so, and the wit. She is a teacher, not in the sense of gu ru or wise woman, but of mentor or helpful guide in the arts and crafts which civil ize human life. In her most tangible aspects, Athena is an extremely practical goddess. She has organizational capability and teaches skills as well as wisdom and philosophy. She is a\"w orker\" in one of her aspects, but she is a trained worker in particular. Her teaching develops experts, from the expert tradesman to the exper t thinker or philosopher. She is the patroness of everyone who is good at their job. Her t alent is lent to the jeweler, weaver, shoemaker, and seamstress. She inspires the maso n, the miller, the carpenter, and the domestic worker. She also bolsters the instructor , politician, soldier, and tactician. As divine patroness of all city-dwellers, she manages the affairs of a pros perous proletariat in an orderly fashion. Masculine skills, such as shipbuilding and engi neering, and new technologies like information processing are her special interests. The skills of persuasiveness through public speaking are her forte. S he values skill in word and deed. In almost all cases her clear-eyed sagacity is intelligently dire cted toward practical, concrete goals. She says, \"Let's get it done,\" whether it is urban renewal or economic development. On the psychological level she is the prototype of the artistically creati ve woman -- soul made manifest in artistic realization. She represents the anima in bot h men and women -- feminine creative power. She is The Feminine as both spirit and soul . Her loving contains no trace of sexual jealousy, so it is not possessive. You may find her in your dreams when you are exploring uncharted territory al one. She is the One in us who struggles against all odds, or risks adventure in foreign e nvironments. She is the assertive goddess, who does not let femininity stand in the way of what she wants to accomplish or explore. She supports heroic striving or upward mobility; she is defensive and eve n militant about it. She handles practical affairs in a clever way, to assure competence, ach ievement, and victory.

Her symbol was t he new moon. She was typically pictured in this aspect as a girl of about 12 years of age. Sinc e Athena was the patroness of the city, girls of this age could bring great honor to th eir families by serving in her temple, so they received abundant, loving devotion f rom their fathers as well as mothers. Aren't we all proud parents when our childr en do well at school or college? The Athenian personality has a feminine content which is oriented tow ard the masculine, or father-principle. She embodies the projection of a positive transf ormation in the character of Zeus, her father: inspiration. She is extremely helpful to t he masculine. She develops mentor relationships with strong men with mutual interes ts. This is partly because it is in her nature to mediate for the masculine and partly be cause of a need to defend herself against the enormous power exerted upon her by the press ures of her father- complex. Athena is one of the few goddesses (including Hestia and Artemis) who is immune to the enchantments of Aphrodite. Therefore her love-life is virtually non-e xistent. She is a companion and advisor to man, but usually without erotic involvement. She can help man relate to the depths of his unconscious in a profound and inclusive w ay. Her functions include building conceptual bridges which help men understand their feelings. They can relate to her because she understands the thought patt erns of logic so well. An Athena-ruled woman generally has a good relationship with her bi ological father. However, she is so identified with him that it may interfere with h er ability to give herself to her human lovers. She is sisterly, understanding, sympathetic and suppor tive, to be sure. But a good portion of psychic energy will be reserved for \"pleasing Daddy.\" Th is is why Athena promotes the perpetuation of city-life, culture, and various craft s. This ensures the continued dominion of Zeus. In terms of time perception, Athena sees time as linear: the past gives rise to the present which then gives birth to the future, in an orderly succession. Proper e volution of events is ensured by the continual reevaluation of development patterns. In general, s he places paramount importance on the orderly flow of events, and the systematic appli cation of clear principles of behavior. She has a high ethical standard which is mai ntained consistently. This fantasy of control, taken to the extreme, can be excessi ve. Athena possesses the drive of a militant or political activist, but all this heroic striving and ego-building may be over-reactive to a fear of being reabsorbed by the father. By def ending"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"the patriarchal order, she imitates her father's spirit. This is he r shadow-self -- the co-opted woman in the service of patriarchy in deep denial. Denial leads to a pervasive fe eling of ambivalence. Freed up, this energy tied up in the shadow-self is trans formative. When this energy flows, it is creativity, inspiration, empowerment. Too much of this identification is a threat to her womanhood. The father may not really control Athena, yet she fantasizes that he does and creates her reality. D o we live our authentic anima nature or our father's fantasy of the anima archetype? She can b ecome independent of him. She needs to realize that strength, courage, and world ly wisdom aren't only masculine attributes. There is feminine wisdom, strength, and conf idence, too, as well as intuition. On the psychological level, Athena is the prototype of the artistically creat ive woman -- the soul made manifest in artistic realization. For men and women, she is th e spirit of achievement, competence, and action in the world. Athena represents the Anima in both men and women -- feminine creative power -- feminine as both spirit an d soul. There is nothing possessive in her love, including no sexual jealousy. Athena is strong in the woman who feels like she determines her own p ath. Even her dreams depict her as an adventurer, explorer, and seeker. She struggles t hrough unfamiliar terrain, asserting herself against obstacles and actively overcom ing them. It sounds heroic, yet is an inherently feminine Way of being. The only story of romance for Athena is with her companion, or co-worker, Hephai stos. It is no true marriage, because her nature is to remain free of entanglements . He wanted to marry her, figuring that they could be united by their common interests , their work, and their pride of craftsmanship. He asked Zeus for her hand, and Zeus agre ed, since they were workmates. But Hephaistos could not overcome Athena's natural repulsion toward his b oorish clumsiness. In other words, they were sexually incompatible--not one anot her's type. Yet something strange occurred in the meantime. When Athena repulsed He phaistos in an attempt to rape her, his seed fell to the earth. The earth became fertile with this seed and an infant son was born c alled Erichthionis. He was reared by nurses for a while, then Athena took him for her own to raise. Ath ena is thus like an independent working woman of today whose deepest desire is to h ave a child. If she is unwed (or even if married), she may conceived via technology. But not want ing the trouble of a young child to dominate their lives, they are left to daycare or pri vate nurses. Her ability to feel may be impaired; she simply \"does not have time for suc h things.\" This may cramp her full expression as either Virgin or Mother. So her overprote ctiveness may seek to protect the core of her femininity. But when she transforms the archaic elements of the masculine spirit, civilized life flourishes. She protects agai nst its ravaging impulses. Athena, as the basis for a civilized state, or symbol of empire, has been perp etuated through history in the figures of other goddesses of the motherland, \"Roma\", \"B ritannia\", Columbia, and the Stature of Liberty.

She makes sure we don't turn into sexual maniacs at work, or walk off the job to follow a religious cal ling. She provides the boundaries within which culture thrives. She ins pires us with wisdom, but keeps practical concerns in view. She is the motivation of those with th eir \"feet on the ground, and heads in the clouds.\" Integration is her ideal. Because she is e xtroverted in her creativity, she fosters deep friendships. Athens is the bedrock of modern society; they gave us democracy. Atheni ans were also among the first to purge their emotions in the theatre. They wanted to be a mod el for how to live. Historians say the greatest Athenian contribution to literature was the rise of drama. In modern life, theatre and film still help us understand the zeigeist of our times. They help us define who we are, and to define and re-define our history as a people. Certain films act as cultural milestones, and help us understand emoti onal situations beyond our personal experience. Greek drama was a product of the worship of the god Dionysus. By the fifth ce ntury B.C., a drama festival to honor this god had become traditional. How did religious rit ual evolve into Greek theatre? The theatre of Ancient Greece evolved from religiou s rites which date back to at least 1200 BC. The Cult of Dionysus, which probably originated in Asia Min or, practised ritual celebrations which may have included alcoholic intoxic ation, orgies, human and animal sacrifices, and perhaps even hysterical rampages by women called m aenads. The cult's most controversial practice involved, it is believed, uninhi bited dancing and emotional displays that created an altered mental state. This altered st ate was known as 'ecstasis', from which the word ecstasy is derived. Dionysiac, hysteria and ' catharsis' also derive from Greek words for emotional release or purification. Ecstasy was an important religious concept to the Greeks, who would come to see theatre as a way of rel easing powerful emotions through its ritual power. Over time, the rites of Dion ysus became mainstream, more formalised and symbolic. The death of a tragic hero was off ered up to god and man rather than the sacrifice of say, a goat. By 600 BC Greece was divided into city-states, separate nations centred in major cities and regions. The most prominent city-state was Athens, where at least 150,000 peopl e lived. It was here that the Rites of Dionysus evolved into what we know today as theatr e. Thespis of Attica added an actor who interacted with the chorus. This actor was called t he protagonist, from which the modern word protagonist is derived, meaning the m ain character of a drama. Introduce a second speaker and one moves from one art, that of choric chant, to another, theatre. Thespis is said to have performed in Athen s about 534 BC. and his name has achieved immortality in theatrical jargon - 'actors' and 'Thespians' are synonymous. In 534 BC, the ruler of Athens, Pisistratus, changed the Dionysian Festivals and instituted drama competitions. Thespis is said to have won the first competition and in the ensuing 50 years, the competitions became popular annual events. A government authori ty called the archon would choose the competitors and the choregos , wealthy patrons who financed the"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"productions. Even in ancient Greece, the funding of the arts was a way of tax avoid ance. In return for funding a production, the choregos would pay no taxes that year. During this time, major theatres were constructed, notably the theatr e at Delphi, the Attic Theatre and the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens. The Theatre of Dionysus, bui lt at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, could seat 17,000 people. During their heyday, the comp etitions drew as many as 30,000 spectators. The words theatre and amphitheatre derive from the Greek word theatron, which referred to the wooden spectator stands erec ted on those hillsides. Similarly, the word orchestra is derived from the Greek w ord for a platform between the raised stage and the audience on which the chorus was situ ated. Plays were performed in the daytime. The annual drama competitions in Ath ens were spread over several, entire days. Actors probably wore little or no makeup. Inste ad, they carried masks with exaggerated facial expressions. They also wore cothornos, or b uskins, which were leather boots laced up to the knees. There was little or no s cenery. Initially, most of the action took place in the orchestra. Later, as the importance shift ed from the chorus to the characters, the action moved to the stage. Between 600 and 500 BC, the dithyramb had evolved into new forms, most notably the tragedy and the ‘satyr’ play. Tragedy, derived from the Greek words tragos (goat) and ode (song), told a story that was intended to teach religious lessons. Much like B iblical parables, tragedies were designed to show the right and wrong paths in life. Traged ies were not simply plays with bad endings, nor were they simply spectacles devise d to ‘make 'em laugh and make 'em cry.’ Tragedy was viewed as a form of ritual purification, Aristot le's catharsis, which gives rise to pathos, another Greek word, meaning 'instruct ive suffering'. They depicted the life voyages of people who steered themselves or who we re steered by fate on collision courses with society, life's rules, or simply fate. The tragic protagonist is one who refuses out of either weakness or strength to acquiesce to fate: what for us now might better be described as the objective reali ties of life. Most often, the protagonist's main fault is hubris , a Greek, and English word meaning false or overweening arrogance. It could be the arrogance of not accepting ones destiny (O edipus Rex), the arrogance of assuming the right to kill (Agamemnon), or the arrogance of assuming the right to seek vengeance (Orestes). Whatever the root cause, t he protagonist's ultimate collision with fate, reality, or society is inevitable and irre vocable. Tragedy did not develop in a vacuum. It was an outgrowth of what was happening at th e time in Athens. One hand, Greek religion had dictated how people shoul d behave and think for centuries. On the other, there was a birth of free thought and intelle ctual inquiry. Athens in the fourth and fifth centuries BC was bustling with rad ical ideas like democracy, philosophy, mathematics, science and art. It boasted philosophers like Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Democritus. There were the first known his torians Thucydides and Herodotus. The scientists and mathematicians like Thales, Hippocr ates, Archimedes, and later Euclid (euclidean geometry), Pythagoras (the Pythagorean theore m), Eratosthenes, Hero (the steam engine!), Hipparchus and Ptolemy. In these respects -- a blossoming of free thought after years of religious di cta -- ancient Athens resembled Renaissance England, which not coincidentally sp awned the next great"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"era in theatre. In essence, the ancient Athenians had begun to question how nature worked, how society should work, and what man's role was in the scheme of things. Trage dy was the poets' answer to some of these questions -- How should one behave? How c an one accept the injustices of life? What is the price of hubris? Read a soliloqu y from a Greek tragedy, or from Hamlet or Macbeth, and what you will hear is these questions b eing asked. Greek mythology is the legends and stories behind the Greek gods. The e arliest Greek dramas, especially those by Aeschylus (525-456 BC), drew their plots and charac ters from these myths. The Tragic Hero or Heroine is someone who has achieved, or who has t he ability to achieve, greatness but who through a weakness, or tragic flaw in his character, falls into the depths of misery and often to his death. Audiences seei ng this happen are supposed to feel a purifying of the spirit as they feel pity for the charact er because of the terrible woes he has suffered, and fear because of their increased aware ness of forces in the world powerful enough to topple even the most mighty and most admirable of men. Caught up in events of great magnitude, spectators are imaginatively liberat ed from all that is dull, petty and mean in life around them-they are stirred by the s pectacle of human greatness, of man daring to reach out beyond reasonable limits in quest of some gl orious ideal. Even when he fails, as fail he must, there is still, for the audie nce, the satisfaction of having viewed nobility in action. The original sin of the Greek tragic hero is hubris , believing that one is god-like. Nobody can be tempted into hubris except one who is exceptionally fortunate. Somet imes he can manifest his hubris directly, but this does not change his character in any way, only he is punished for it by being made by the gods to sin unwittingly or involuntaril y. In Greek tragedy suffering is a visitation from heaven, a punishment impos ed upon the hero from without. Through enduring it he expiates his sins and ends recon ciled to the law, though it is for the gods not him to decide when his expiation is complete. I n modern tragedy, on the other hand, this exterior kind of suffering which humbles the great and erring and leads them to repent is not tragic. The truly tragic kind of suffe ring is the kind produced and defiantly insisted upon by the hero himself so that, inst ead of making him better, it makes him worse and when he dies he is not reconciled to t he law but defiant, that is, damned. Lear is not a tragic hero. Othello is. One of the things which become clear when one reads the poets or drama tists of ancient Greece is that the world and Gods they deal with are for them immensely re al and living. The gods, the supernatural beings that so frequently appear and direct man 's life and thought, were not for them, as they may be for us, mere figments of the imaginati on, poetic invention and so on. They are living, dynamic forces, terrible and terrifying real ities. They are revealing and expressing the inner movement and operation of cosmic powers . And the sense of the activity of such powers seems to pervade the whole of life. Th e expression of this god-haunted, god-tormented universe in which they lived by poets and d ramatists meant that there was an immediate, urgent, and vital connection between lit erature and life. It is expressed in three key terms."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"HAMARTIA: - An error of judgement. Hamartia, derived from a Greek wor d meaning fault is sometimes known as the tragic flaw because it represents a fatal w eakness that causes the downfall of a protagonist in tragedy. This hamartia may be caused by i nherited weakness, by faulty character traits, or by poor judgement; whatever the cause , the result is action or inaction, that leads to destruction or death. HUBRIS: -Arrogance; excessive self-pride and self-confidence. Hu bris, a Greek term for insolence, referred to the emotions in Greek tragic heroes that led th em ignore warnings from the gods and thus invite catastrophe. Hubris is that form of hamartia that stems from overbearing pride and self-assumed superiority. CATHARSIS: -This term is from a Greek word, kathairein, meaning to cle an or to purify. Catharsis refers to any emotional discharge that brings about an emotional or spi ritual renewal or welcome relief from tension and anxiety. The primary idea is th at an audience, any audience, filled with confusion and unhealthy emotions, such as pity and fear, comes to see a play developing make-believe actions that would be harmful if occurrin g in real life. The audience participates emotionally in the dramatic action and goes away psychologically cleansed, purged of injurious feelings and sensations. L iterary critics have never agreed whether catharsis means that members of an audience thus l earn to avoid the evil and destructive emotions of a tragic hero or that their inner conflicts are quieted by an opportunity to expend pity and fear upon such a protagonist. In the play \" Prometheus Bound \", Terzopoulos is trying to release the human energy, hidden in the body, through stillness and immobility. The play exposes the conflict between the new and the old values in life: in the old Prometheus scale, Man need s to be united with Nature, God and the Polis, while in the new order God is the Superior B eing and all creatures must obey to Him. Prometheus, as a symbol of freedom, is the one that brings to light the power of LAW, which frightens man and god, he seeks the secret key of balance between logic and instinct, between the order and the chaos but he wi ll never find it, even when he will get liberated by Hercules. Many words assoiated with theatre have roots in Greek. Theatre comes for th e word theatron meaning \"seeing place\"; drama comes form the word dran meaning \"t o do\". Ancient Greek theatre was a \"... mixture of myth, legend, philosophy, social commentary, poetry, dance, music, public participation, and visual splendor.\" Narration of a story or legend, was only a means by which the author might explore t he nature of mankind. In doing so, the tragedian turned firmly away from realis tic depictions of Athenian citizens to a higher, ideal level of heroic men and women. Even th e gods themselves might make an appearance. However great, the human beings in a t ragedy had flaws which led them to ruin. The playwrights sought to illuminate b oth the greatness and defects of mankind.

She develops strategies; she is the consummate problem-solver. She has a strongly developed capacity for logical or lin ear thinking which serves her well in the practical world. She also has the capacity for facilitating or mediating disputes and conflicts. Athena has her own agenda, her own priorities, and her own feminine style of rat ionality. As Jean Bolen has pointed out, \"The Athena archetype thrives in the busine ss, academic, scientific, military, or political arenas.\" Economics or financial matter s is her forte. Yet, she needs to balance business with her private life, or risk one-sided development and emotional stunting. She can't live only in her head without connecting wit h emotions and fully inhabiting the body. One natural balance for Athena is through craft s such as weaving, sewing, or pottery. She can be a diplomat, but her shadow-side is a manipulator, rival, and compet itor. To steel herself against the onslaught of life, she armors herself in a ph ysical sense. Holding in and tensing muscles chronically leads to body armor which distorts the fr ee flow of energy in the body. It leads to the concretization of physical traits in the body, much like we find personality traits \"solidified\" as the ego in the psyche. Her main health complaints are likely to come from stress disorders . Athena is fairly conservative in lifestyle and persona. Other than the father-complex, she is generally in good mental and physical health, if she has realized the value of regular exercis e. She seeks out others to help her maintain both, readily accepting the expertise of ot her professionals."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"She can readily be either teacher or student. When we are in school, or livin g the student life in a university town, we are in touch with Athena. Some of us are eternal students, always looking for something new to learn. When we go to a library, seminar, or symposium, Athena is there. She also participates in every \"think tank.\" An 'Atheneum' is named after the temple of Athena at Athens and now m eans various things including a place where writers and scholars meet. It may mean an am phitheater lecture hall, or a literary or scientific club. It is also applied to a librar y or reading room. Whenever we return to school for continuing education, be it in handicraft s, the arts, communication, and especially to trade or technical school, it is from the p rompting of Athena. She is the prime motivator. In her service we seek to become m ore learned individuals and function more effectively within the community. He r temple has become the halls of academia, our halls of higher learning. Athena's ideology is Gnosticism and Sophia is her Gnostic form. Gnosticis m is the teaching based on Gnosis, the knowledge of transcendence arrived at by way of interior, i ntuitive means. Although Gnosticism thus rests on personal religious experience , it is a mistake to assume all such experience results in Gnostic recognitions. It is near er the truth to say that Gnosticism expresses a specific religious experience, an experienc e that does not lend itself to the language of theology or philosophy, but which is instead closely affinit ized to, and expresses itself through, the medium of myth. Indeed, one finds that m ost Gnostic scriptures take the forms of myths. The term “myth” should not here b e taken to mean “stories that are not true”, but rather, that the truths embodied in the se myths are of a different order from the dogmas of theology or the statements of philosophy. All religious traditions acknowledge that the world is imperfect. Wher e they differ is in the explanations which they offer to account for this imperfection and in wh at they suggest might be done about it. Gnostics have their own -- perhaps quite startling -- view of these matters: they hold that the world is flawed because it was created in a flawed manner. Like Buddhism, Gnosticism begins with the fundamental recognition that e arthly life is filled with suffering. Human beings, with their complex physiology andpsychology, are awar e not only of these painful features of earthly existence. They also suffer from t he frequent recognition that they are strangers living in a world that is flawed and absur d. The ancient Greeks, especially the Platonists, advised people to look to t he harmony of the universe, so that by venerating its grandeur they might forget heir immediate afflictions. But since this harmony still contains the cruel flaws, forlornness and alienation of existence, this advice is considered of little value by Gnostics. Nor is t he Eastern idea of Karma regarded by Gnostics as an adequate explanation of creation’s imperfe ction and suffering. Karma at best can only explain how the chain of suffering and imper fection works. It does not inform us in the first place why such a sorrowful and mali gn system should exist. The Gnostic God concept is more subtle than that of most religions. In its w ay, it unites and reconciles the recognitions of Monotheism and Polytheism, as well as of Th eism, Deism and Pantheism. In the Gnostic view, there is a true, ultimate and transce ndent God, who is beyond all created universes and who never created anything in the sense i n which the word “create” is ordinarily understood. While this True God did not fashion or create"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"anything, He (or, It) “emanated” or brought forth from within Himself the subs tance of all there is in all the worlds, visible and invisible. In a certain sense, it may therefore be true to say that all is God, for all consists of the substance of God. By the same token, it must also be recognized that many portions of the original d ivine essence have been projected so far from their source that they underwe nt unwholesome changes in the process. To worship the cosmos, or nature, or embodied creatu res is thus tantamount to worshipping alienated and corrupt portions of the emanated divine essence. The basic Gnostic myth has many variations, but all of these refer to Aeons, int ermediate deific beings who exist between the ultimate, True God and ourselves. T hey, together with the True God, comprise the realm of Fullness (Pleroma) wherein th e potency of divinity operates fully. The Fullness stands in contrast to our existential state, which in comparison may be called emptiness. One of the aeonial beings who bears the name Sophia (“Wisdom”) is of great impor tance to the Gnostic world view. In the course of her journeyings, Sophia came to emanat e from her own being a flawed consciousness, a being who became the creator of the m aterial and psychic cosmos, all of which he created in the image of his own flaw. This b eing, unaware of his origins, imagined himself to be the ultimate and absolute God. Since he took the already existing divine essence and fashioned it into various forms, he is also cal led the Demiurgos or “half-maker” There is an authentic half, a true deific component withi n creation, but it is not recognized by the half-maker and by his cosmicminions, the Archons or “rulers”. Human nature mirrors the duality found in the world: in part it was made by the false creator God and in part it consists of the light of the True God. Humankin d contains a perishable physical and psychic component, as well as a spiritual componen t which is a fragment of the divine essence. This latter part is often symbolically re ferred to as the “divine spark”. The recognition of this dual nature of the world and of the h uman being has earned the Gnostic tradition the epithet of “dualist”. Humans are generally ignorant of the divine spark resident within them. Th is ignorance is fostered in human nature by the influence of the false creator and his Archons, who together are intent upon keeping men and women ignorant of their true nat ure and destiny. Anything that causes us to remain attached to earthly things serves t o keep us in enslavement to these lower cosmic rulers. Death releases the divine s park from its lowly prison, but if there has not been a substantial work of Gnosis undertak en by the soul prior to death, it becomes likely that the divine spark will be hurled back in to, and then re- embodied within, the pangs and slavery of the physical world. Not all humans are spiritual (pneumatics) and thus ready for Gnosis and lib eration. Some are earthbound and materialistic beings (hyletics), who recognize only t he physical reality. Others live largely in their psyche (psychics). Such people usually mi stake the Demiurge for the True God and have little or no awareness of the spiritual world beyond mat ter and mind. In the course of history, humans progress from materialistic sensate s lavery, by way of ethical religiosity, to spiritual freedom and liberating Gnosis. Evolution ary forces alone are"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"insufficient, however, to bring about spiritual freedom. Humans are cau ght in a predicament consisting of physical existence combined with ignoran ce of their true origins, their essential nature and their ultimate destiny. To be liberated f rom this predicament, human beings require help, although they must also contribute their own efforts. Gnostics do not look to salvation from sin (original or other), but rather from the ignorance of which sin is a consequence. Ignorance -- whereby is meant ignorance of spi ritual realities -- is dispelled only by Gnosis, and the decisive revelation of Gnosis is br ought by the Messengers of Light, especially by Christ, the Logos of the True God. It is not b y His suffering and death but by His life of teaching and His establishing of mysteries that Christ has performed His work of salvation. On the one hand, Gnostic salvation may easily be mistaken for an unmediated ind ividual experience, a sort of spiritual do-it-yourself project. Gnostics hold t hat the potential for Gnosis, and thus, of salvation is present in every man and woman, and that salvation is not vicarious but individual. One needs also remember that knowledge of our tr ue nature -- as well as other associated realizations -- are withheld from us by our very cond ition of earthly existence. The True God of transcendence is unknown in this world, in fact He is often called the Unknown Father. It is thus obvious that revelation from on H igh is needed to bring about salvation. The indwelling spark must be awakened from its te rrestrial slumber by the saving knowledge that comes “from without”. The present period of Western culture perhaps resembles in more ways that of second and third century Alexandria. It seems therefore appropriate that Gnostic s in our age adopt the attitudes of classical Alexandrian Gnosticism, wherein matters of cond uct were largely left to the insight of the individual. Gnosticism embraces numerous general attitudes toward life: it encou rages non- attachment and non-conformity to the world, a “being in the world, but not of the world”; a lack of egotism; and a respect for the freedom and dignity of other beings. Non etheless, it appertains to the intuition and wisdom of every individual “Gnostic” to dis till from these principles individual guidelines for their personal application. Death does not automatically bring about liberation from bondage in the realms of the Demiurge.Those who have not attained to a liberating Gnosis while they were in embodiment may become trapped in existence once more. It is quite li kely that this might occur by way of the cycle of rebirths. Gnosticism does not emphasize the doc trine of reincarnation prominently, but it is implicitly understood in most Gn ostic teachings that those who have not made effective contact with their transcendental origin s while they were in embodiment would have to return into the sorrowful condition of ear thly life. In regard to salvation, or the fate of the spirit and soul after death, one needs t o be aware that help is available. Valentinus, the greatest of Gnostic teachers, taught that Christ and Sophia await the spiritual man -- the pneumatic Gnostic -- at the en trance of the Pleroma, and help him to enter the bridechamber of final reunion. Gnosticism helped to clarify, the nature of Jungian spiritual therapy.\" In the light of such recognitions one may ask: \"Is Gnosticism a religion or a psychology?\" The answer is that it"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"may very-well be both.

For instance the myth of Sophia res embles closely the story of the human psyche that loses its connection with the c ollective unconscious and needs to be rescued by the Self. Many esoteric teachings have proclaimed, \" As it is above, so it is below. \" Our psychological nature (the microcosm) mirrors metaphysical natur e (the macrocosm), thus Gnosticism may possess both a psychological and a religious authenticit y. Gnostic psychology and Gnostic religion need not be exclusive of one another but may comp lement each other within an implicit order of wholeness. Gnostics have always hel d that divinity is immanent within the human spirit, although it is not limited to it. The convergence of Gnostic religious teaching with psychological insight is thus quite un derstandable in terms of time-honored Gnostic principles. Theology has been called an intellectual wrapping around the spiritual k ernel of a religion. If this is true, then it is also true that most religions are being st rangled and stifled by their wrappings. Gnosticism does not run this danger, because its world view i s stated in myth rather than in theology. Myths, including the Gnostic myths, may be interpre ted in diverse ways. Transcendence, numinosity, as well as psychological archetypes along with other elements, play a role in such interpretation. Still, such mythic stateme nts tell of profound truths that will not be denied. Stephan A. Hoeller (Tau Stephanus, Gnost ic Bishop). The birth of Athena, or Wise Reflection, begins with a curious story. It see ms Zeus got a colossal migraine when he found out that his wife Hera had born a son through a V irgin birth. This son was Hephaistos. Not to be outdone even by Hera with feminin e self- sufficiency, Zeus produced Athena directly from his cerebral cort ex or forebrain. She is the queenly daughter of Light, his \"brainchild,\" so to speak. This mystic bir th of wisdom means that what was formerly unconscious is now conscious, and in the dayligh t world. Hephaistos split open the head of Zeus with an axe to liberate her and reli eve Zeus. She emerged fully armed and majestic from the beginning. Athena is the divine embodiment of God's wisdom. God manifests along geom etrical principles when the divine begins to manifest, crossing the threshol d of matter from matrix patterns to crystallizing matter. She therefore rules the alchemical quest of extracting the soul or spirit imprisoned in matter. She is the goddess of natural philos ophy or physics. The medieval quest goes on today in physics and other sciences which seek t o discover the hidden spirit, or \"how things work.\" Athena gives up her secrets, her i ntuitions, her tricks of the trade, slowly but surely. This quest is accomplished by quenching the fires of desirousness (i.e. Aphrodite). This doesn't mean all scientists must give up their sex lives! Rather, it imp lies that research is a long and tedious process, and one must not \"lust for results.\" Success wi ll come through persistence and the \"inspiration\" of technological breakthroughs, the gifts of Athena. Sophia is the Gnostic version of Athena, which was later co-opted by the O rthodox Church and identified with the celestial qualities of Virgin Mary, mother of the spirit. For the Gnostic, she is the indwelling direct mystical experience of God -- an inspiring manifestation of divine force. This upwelling energy was depicted in east ern religion as the"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Kundalini serpent-energy rising into the brain. This is the introver ted experience of Sophia. In an extroverted expression, disengaging Sophia-Athena, the feminine pe rsonification of spirit, from the embrace of Physis means to make her give up her secret s. Sophia is considered to be the sum of archetypal images in the mind of God. She is th e living, breathing imagery of the Divine imagination. These prototypical patterns or ide as are like the Platonic solids which lie at the base of phenomenal manifestation. The y are geometries - - the invisible building blocks of matter. Thomas Aquinas inadvertently described the quality of Athena when he said, \" ...divine wisdom devised the order of the universe residing in the distinct ion of things, and therefore we must say that in the divine wisdom are the models of all thin gs, which we have called ideas -- i.e. exemplary forms existing in the divine mind. \" On the psychological level of soul, James Hillman speaks of Athena as meaning psychological reflection. The energy directed toward inner integration i s the goddess \"who grants topos , judging where each event belongs in relation to all other events.\" Further reading on Athena is found in, THE GODDESS, Christine Dowing, 1983 GODDESSES IN EVERY WOMAN, Jean Shinoda Bolen THE IMPOSTER SYNDROME, Pauline Rose Clance, Ph.D. THE MEANING OF APHRODITE, Paul Friedrich ATHENE, VIRGIN MOTHER, Murray Stein FACING THE GODS, James Hillman, Ed. THE MOON AND THE VIRGIN, Nor Hall SPIRITUAL MYTH: Concerned with policies and political issues, one of Athena's spiritu al cries for our generation is \"globalization.\" The hitory of globalization is rooted in the mar riage of religion, trade, armies, industry, technology, agriculture and banking. Long befor e 1492, people began to link together disparate locations on the globe into extensive systems of communication, migration, and interconnections. This formation of syst ems of interaction between the global and the local has been a central driving force in world h istory. Global means the expansive interconnectivity of localities -- spanning local sites of everyday social, economic, cultural, and political life -- a phenonmenon but also a sp atial attribute -- so a global space or geography is a domain of connectivity spanning distances and linkin g localities to one another, which can be portrayed on maps by lines indicating r outes of movement, migration, translation, communication, exchange, etc. Globalization is the physical expansion of the geographical domain of the global -- that is, the increase in the scale and volume of global flows -- and the increasing im pact of global forces of all kinds on local life. Moments and forces of expansion mark the ma jor turning points and landmarks in the history of globalization"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"The globalization debate has rightly been called the grand ideological battl e of the 21st century. It has pitted student activists against corporate heads, union me mbers against environmentalists, Mexican peasants against officials of the Internation al Monetary Fund. Their main concern: the lack of citizen participation in decisions of international economics and trade policy. Their main enemy: institutions and corporations that wor k outside of the purview of democratically elected governments. In essence, globalization is redrawing the old ideological lines of the cold w ar. No longer do people debate the merits of capitalism and communism. Rather, issues such as international trade, corporate power, national economic sovereignty, human righ ts and the transformation of indigenous cultures have moved to the center of the d ebate. And if there is new geopolitical line to be drawn it cuts not the East from the West bu t the North from the South. What is \"globalization\" and why should anyone care about it? There are a lot of di fferent answers to this question, depending on whom you ask. The dominant view among peop le who write and speak about the issue is that globalization is an inevitable , technologically driven process that is increasing commercial and political relations be tween people of different countries. For them, it is not only a natural phenomenon, but p rimarily good for the world, although it is recognized that the process produces both \"w inners and losers.\" There is a much deeper skepticism about the process among the gener al population. For example, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58% of Amer icans believed that trade had reduced U.S. jobs and wages, a view that is almost never expressed by commentators or those who shape public opinion. This widening gap bet ween elite and public opinion is striking, because it is not difficult to imagine how e conomic globalization might lower living standards for the majority of people in the United Stat es. For example, the idea that increasing competition from low-wage imports would driv e U.S. wages downward seems only logical. And there is now a wealth of evidence, even from p rominent economists who strongly favor free trade, that this has happened over the las t two decades. The fact that the real wage of the typical American worker has actually fallen over the past 25 years, as the economy had become increasingly globalized, is also an indicator that something is wrong with the process of globalization. According to tradition al economic theory, wage and salary earners gain from more open trade, because they get cheaper consumer goods. But it is clear, according to universally accepted measures of wages and salaries in the United States, that for most employees these gains from t rade have been more than canceled out by other forces that have pushed their pay downward . Debate within the economics profession has yet to influence the agenda of t he major policy makers or corporations, who continue to strive for increasing globalization. Wh o gains and who loses from this process? We can define globalization as an increase in tr ade and capital flows across national boundaries. What does the balance of payments include? I t is divided into two parts: the balance of trade, and what economists call the current ac count, because it includes more than just trade—things like foreign interest payme nts and transfers. While \"current account\" is the proper term, many people use \"trade balance\" an d \"current account balance\" interchangeably, since trade is the biggest item in the c urrent account."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"The second part of the balance of payments is called the capital account. This measures the purchase and sale of assets across national boundaries. A simple way to distingu ish between the two accounts of the balance of payments is that the capital accou nt measures international investing, borrowing, and lending—whereas the current ac count measures just about everything else. The international balance of payments accounti ng is very similar. If we import more than we export, we must either borrow or sell as sets internationally, in order to finance that trade deficit. That means we are add ing to our foreign debt. (This is not to be confused with our national debt, which is owed mainly to people and institutions here). Horrific, unsustainable debt burdens raise the question of wheth er some countries might be better off just defaulting on their debt—that is, refusing to pay it—even if they were punished by international banks and investors. The answer to this quest ion depends partly on how one evaluates thegains that they get from international trade and inves tment—i.e., increasing globalization. Is globalization progress? Nearly all of the experts and j ournalists who write about this subject would answer at least a qualified \"yes\" to this question. For some, there is a natural progression from the medieval fiefdoms of Europe to the nation-state, to the increasing importance of international institutions such as the UN or the IMF. Others are in less of a hurry to build the institutions of worl d government, but nonetheless see the increase in trade and commercial relations betw een countries as a step forward for humanity. And almost everyone views the process of globalization as inevitable in any case, flowing naturally from advances in communications, transportation, an d other technological changes. It is certainly possible to imagine a world in which globalization could raise the standard of living for the majority of the world’s people. It could increase the si ze of markets and the efficiency of production, allow countries who are short on capital to borrow fr om those who have a surplus, and even break down some of the barriers and prejudice s that have contributed to military conflicts in the past. But the historical re cord of the current era of globalization is quite another story. As noted above, the typical wage earner in the United States has suffered a de cline in real wages since 1973. It is important to recognize that this decline is at least par tly a result of a choice to pursue a particular form of globalization. Our political leaders have c hosen to negotiate, over a period of decades, a set of rules that has thrown U.S. workers int o increasing competition with much lower-paid counterparts throughout the world. This has had the effect, not surprisingly, of lowering wages for most Americans. The latter set of problems has been recognized, to varying degrees, by pro-global ization economists and policy-makers. However, these people tend to emphasize th e benefits or potential benefits of globalization. For trade, they rely on a simple but abs tract economic theory: the principle of comparative advantage. This theory asserts that all countries are made better off by moving toward freer trade. The idea is that different c ountries are relatively more efficient at producing different things. On this bas is it is easy to demonstrate that the world can benefit if each country specializes in the production of those goods that it can produce most efficiently and trades with other count ries who do likewise."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"There are a number of problems with this theory when it is applied to t he real economy. First of all, even the theory itself does not assert that everyone in each coun try is made better off through reer trade. There are \"winners and losers,\" and the theory only predicts that for the entire country the gains outweigh the losses.In other words, t here is a profound bias against any kind of national economic development strategy. The obvious problem with this application of the theory of comparative advant age is that it rules out most of the strategies that the developed countries of the worl d have used in order to attain the standard of living that they enjoy today. The extreme case can be seen in Russia, where industry has been practically dismantled under IMF sup ervision since the demise of the Soviet Union. The country now produces almost nothing but ene rgy. In the process, Russia’s economy has shrunk by more than half in just a few years, an d they have suffered an increase in poverty and declines in life expectancy that are historically unprecedented, in the absence of war or natural disaster. Indeed, critics of globalization would argue that the experience of the las t two decades—in which the architects of the global economy have increasingly re-crafted the economies of most of the world towards their ideal of unified international markets—h as been a failure by almost any measure of economic performance. And there is no reason to assume that institutions that are controlled by a small group of people from one or a handf ul of high income countries would adequately represent the interests of the w orld’s poor and working people. For the most prominent policy makers and writers on this topic, \"refor m\" is synonymous with the opening of markets, privatization, and reducing the role of governmen t in the economy. Indeed this has become the standard definition of reform in t he media. For most of these people, the recent economic turmoil is just a bump in the road t oward a more integrated world economy and the social progress that it promises. They gener ally favor increased regulation for \"emerging market\" banking and financial sys tems, as well as greater \"transparency\"—that is, better information for investors. In the United States, whose government has been the most powerful advocat e of the current form of globalization, measures to ameliorate the worst excesses of the global economy—either here or abroad—will most likely not be warmly received. If hi story is any guide, proponents of such changes throughout the world will be dismiss ed as \"trying to turn the clock back,\" \"protectionists,\" and worse. And, as often happens i n the real world, some of their leaders or followers—as in Malaysia or Russia today—will have right- wing or authoritarian ideologies attached to them. But this does not mean that their pro-national, regional, or local economic deve lopment policies are misguided. Or that the men who have been working overtime to \" write the constitution of a single, global economy\" are right.

Some fathers ar e irresponsible overgrown adolescents, while others might be spineless jellyfish, or bl ue-collar rather than white-collar types. Ask Athena about the subconscious aspects of your rel ationship with your father. Athena unites the virginal father's daughter and the encouragin g mother of the spirit. Athena has to do with the father's anima and his daughter's embodiment of th at feminine spirit. It reflects in our religious notions about God, the Father, and our soul's yearning for that source of acceptance. Athena is the embodiment of the father's spir itual nature. Is she conservative and compulsive within him, or realize the loving, forgiving God. You can ask Athena about the issues of the day in your dialogues. Topics might i nclude foreign policy, social mores, values, politics and the arts. You may know your own conscious viewpoint on these issues very well, but subconsciously thi s part of you may feel differently. Also, when you inquire about issues and morals, be sure just who is replying from the inner cast of characters. For example, on the issue of abortion: Demeter might consider any anti-li fe notion or action an abomination, while Artemis or Athena probably consider it a simple expediency. Identification with these different archetypes unconsciously cau ses our attitudes and thought patterns to correspond with their typical patterns. Thus our dec isions, or crossroads in life may depend on which archetypal voice our ego chooses to ident ify with most. When you have any outer life decisions to make in regard to your integrity, ethics, morals, job position, justice, etc., it is wise to seek Athena's counsel. Her sage advi ce may be able to help you make some sense of the conflicting inner voices commenting on t he issue. She may even be the mediator for a divine round-table discussion. She can even br ing some logic to the subjective emotionalism of other gods and goddesses, such as Aphrodite, D emeter, or Hera.

CHAPTER V: THE HIEROPHANT HERA Hera is a variation on the theme of the matriarchal Great Goddess. The Great Goddess had many lovers and was extremely independent until the arrival of the patriarc hal northern culture in the Mediterranean area (see Reisler's The Chalice and the Blade ). They brought their sky religion with its chief exponent, Zeus. After a 300 year courtship, the fusion of cultures was consummated by the h ieros gamos or Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera. Hera settled into her new role as exemplary wife , giving up her polyandrous lifestyle, but not her independence. She became th e pattern for all good married women, whose pasts are forgiven if not almost forgotten. Hera is there fore the patroness and guardian of the institution of marriage, as well as the legitim ate spouse of"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Zeus. Many of today's conjugal unions are about healing the millennial split be tween patriarchy and matriarchy -- the war of the sexes -- through gender reunion. Her authority over the marriage came from her originally wider intere st in the lives of women in general. She is also associated with certain aspects of fecundity an d childbearing, even though her union with Zeus was not characteristically fertile. She combines both earthy and lunar aspects in her personality, which mak es her both practical and soulful. Hera has a deep shadow nature, and she has the dubiou s distinction of being the most jealous character in mythology. It may seem strange to link Hera with \"The Hierophant,\" but not when cer tain elements are considered. The sacredness of marriage is stressed in all the major religions of the world as a means of channeling the instinct of sexual desire, and fulfillin g the mating instinct. The Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera also symbolizes wholeness of the individual personality. The Hierophant exemplifies this male-female wholeness. T his prefigures the spiritual marriage of the soul with the celestial Lord, where the human s oul is likened to a \"bride.\" In ancient times is marriage of god and mortal was celebrated anonymou sly with priestesses of the great goddess. \" The 'heiros gamos,' the sacred prostitute was the votary chosen to embody the godde ss. She was the goddess' fertile womb, her passion and her erotic nature. In the union with the god, embodied by the reigning monarch, she assured the fertility and well -being of the land and the people. . . she did not make love in order to obtain admiration or devotion from the man who came to her, for often she remained veiled and anonymous; her r aison d'être was to worship the goddess in lovemaking, thereby bringing the goddess love i nto the human sphere. In this union -- the union of masculine and feminin e, spiritual and physical -- the personal as transcended and the divine entered in. As the embodi ment of the goddess in the mystical union of the sacred marriage, the sacred prostitut e aroused the male and was the receptacle for his passion . . . . The sacred prostitute was the h oly vessel wherein chthonic and spiritual forces united. \" (Qualls-Corbett) There are many kinds of hieros gamos unions: the primordial hierosgamos of G aea and Uranus, the \"sacred sex\" with a hierodule or sacred prostitute, or sexu ality in marriage blessed by the priesthood as the spiritual dimension of marriage. Hera em bodies the later kind. In the balance of power, there are marriages of equals and there are m arriages where one or the other spouse is generally dominant. Existentially, there are many kinds of marriages: those based on contracts, c hildren, shared interests, friendships, partnerships, polyamorous, alchemic al and soul unions. The best marriages put the union first, even above the children who then feel more secure. They are a combination of partnership, friendship, sexuality, nurturing, accep tance and spirituality. The link to the alchemical \"chymical marriage\" implies chemistry is significant. Nevertheless, marriage is a crucible of spiritual transfor mation. The Hierophant, the priest who joins people with one another and with God, is associated with the astrological sign Taurus, and shares traits with Hera. In her origi nal cult-forms"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"she was known as the \"goddess of the yoke,\" \"rich in oxen\" (Taurus being the Bull), who kept sacred herds of cows. She is \"cow-eyed\" for her large brown eyes. As \"god dess of the yoke\" she prefigures the devotion to the sky principle seen in modern par ticipants in Yoga (which also means \"yoking\"). The trump is associated with the rules of obed ience and loyalty--to a guru, organization, work, country, etc. On the physical plane, Hera manifests as the mating instinct, child birth, parthenogenesis, and the flow of adrenaline especially in jealousy. Emotionally she reflect s the dual faces of marriage when perfected or thwarted. Divorce is the cognitive notion assoc iated with her, while her spiritual myth is the sacred marriage. As an Olympian, Hera was the daughter of Cronos and Rhea. She was the sister of Demeter, Hades, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus. She was mother of Ares, Arge, Disc ordia, Eleithyia, Hebe and Hephaistos, and probably Typhon. Hera knows how to play the societal game. She teaches and upholds the tradit ions of society, giving and receiving advice. When she wants to she displays loyalty, obedie nce, and discipline. She makes authoritative allies and draws on the powers of m oral law. Hera was famous for her tirades against her husband because of his philanderin g. The former plight of Princess Diana and her response to Prince Charles's affair was a classi c Hera role. PHYSICAL FORM Hera is a goddess distinguished by her great antiquity. Her name means sim ply 'Lady,\" and her original consort was known simply as 'Hero,\" or Lord. It is interesti ng to note that the very first temple at Mt. Olympus was hers. It dates from the secon d half of the 7th Century B.C. to 1000 B.C. She is also the official patroness of the OLYMPIC GAMES, which were or iginated by her muscular hero, Herakles (Hercules). The fact that his twelve labors we re in service to her is shown by his name being derived from her own. The stories and rites surrounding Hera indicate an instinctual backgrou nd as the mating instinct. The antiquity of the goddess shows the instinctual natur e of her origin. This instinct seeks fulfillment of a particular sort which will not be su blimated to other goals. It has very little to do with lust or sex, per se. If this instinct is forced to d eviate from its goal, it will instead turn negative, as Hera's personality shows. The wifehood of Hera seeks as her essential mode-of-being the requi red marital union with her spouse on several levels. She is not concerned merely with his physic al fidelity (although it would be nice), or his ability to father children upon her, or be a responsive parent to the children. Rather, she is driven by a compulsive necessity to be perfected through conjugal union. The instinct for a multi-level intimate relationship is natural. She wan ts to know the ins and outs of her spouse. Their union must include physical, emotional, psychologic al or intellectual, and spiritual levels."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Curiously, like many \"royal couples,\" Hera and Zeus are both siblings and mates. T his royal marriage was literalized in ancient Egypt, through sibling consorts for t he pharaoh. This symbolism of brother/sister love represents the restoration of bi sexual totality. It is a psychological resolution of original brother/sister duality. They are aspect s of the same essence. Their re-union is expressed in an alchemical verse: White-skinned lady, lovingly joined to her ruddy-limbed husband, Wrapped in each other's arms in the bliss of connubial union, Merge and dissolve as they come to the goal of perfection: They that were two are made one, as though of one body. On a more practical level, Hera cannot abide having a \"token spouse\" or an official husband who periodically checks in while he carries on his life el sewhere. His proximity and commitment to her are critical. She embodies the desire for the arch etypal hieros gamos, or sacred marriage, which occurs between male and female on the physi cal, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual planes of experience. Even while dating, Hera is always looking for a potential spouse. Hera feels ess entially incomplete without a partner. Marriage to her means fulfillment and sat isfaction. In contrast the Amazon likes the \"thrill of the chase,\" while Aphrodite s eeks immediate physical gratification, and Athena companionship or perhaps a useful busi ness alliance. Though their essence is Feminine, these forces operate in both men and women. As wife, Hera wants to share her spouse's day-to-day activities. You bet she wan ts to stay abreast of the business dealings. Why, what if he should die, and she nee ds to take charge of the estate? If another archetypal priority supersedes the Hera drive, s he may avoid being prepared for such contingencies, yet fully able to take the reins of c ommand. Hera would probably prefer to have Zeus all to herself if her secret w ish were know, but then how could he be Zeus in such a context? If she got her wish, imagine how t hey would quarrel under such close confinement. Each are accustomed to maintai ning many outside interests. Besides, in any setting, Zeus cannot bring her to fulfillmen t as long as he carries her own unlived masculinity or animus. Hera wishes to experience depth of relationship with Zeus. To really do t hat, she needs to develop a relationship with her own animus, but that may seems too abstract . Inner work may not come naturally to her, but therapy may become her refuge if she be comes a dissatisfied wife. To her, marriage is no abstract institution. She does not wish Zeus to assert his independence from wedlock with her. She doesn't even wish him to turn inward on his own resources, as she probably needs to do. I f he follows his own inner feminine voice and becomes too introverted, she feels thwarte d in her fulfillment since he may become emotionally unavailable. He has turned inward to his brilliant daughter, Athena, his brainchild with all the ideas. Hera can also be jealous of her spouse's attention to real children, parents, j ob, or other relationships. This reaction veils an underlying fear of abandonment."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"The fact is that Hera and Zeus are mutually dependent on one another for the fulfillment of this basic drive, the mating instinct. Depending on the basic emotional adjustment of the personalities in the relationship, this will manifest as negative co-d ependence, positive inter-dependence, or a combination of these patterns. Marriage requires active listening, not just to the partner, but to one's d eep self. Problems in marriage reflect voices from the unconscious which need to be hear d. Marital problems are a product of the inner conflicts each of the partners bring to the relat ionship. But these very problems, which crop up in the marriage arena, reflect unconscious forces which have the potential for bringing each partner to wholeness, the inne r marriage within oneself. It means integrating the other side of the personality so its ener gies can be used in constructive ways. It is the marriage of the conscious personality and the an ima or animus. This is the daily confrontation of married life, getting up and going to bed toge ther, merely being in one another's presence. It is transformative; it is a yoga or \"yoking\" o f individuals in the service of their union. Marriage itself can be a spiritual path, or app roached from a spiritual perspective. Having meaningful interaction and true intimacy requires renewed con cern for the \"now.\" The sacred marriage always takes place \"now.\" There is no emotional relianc e on a golden, honeymoon past nor escape to an idealized future when \"surely everything wi ll be better.\" The sacred marriage is an arena for individuation of the partners through th e mutual give- and-take of everyday life. The sacred marriage is no final act but requires periodic renewal. This cyclic renewal is intrinsic to the Hera cult. She was symb olically purified and renewed her commitment to Zeus in recurrent wedding ceremonie s. So when we choose in life to renew our marriage vows on an anniversary, we follow Hera's lead. These multiple weddings indicate a return to the condition of uncon scious, original identity. At the time of the wedding, Zeus and Hera are truly one through the process of identification or participation mystique. But, inevitably, another crisis situation creates a critical atmosphere, but it is a necessary prelude to conscious realizati ons. And the cycle goes on... In her article \"Sexuality and Marriage: Divine Marriage or Divine Alchemy,\" We ndy Doniger (the Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions at the Divin ity), points out that sexual issues have always been at the heart of religion, with its concern f or procreation, origins, birth, the survival of the human race. Rabbis, Christian c lerics, Imams, and Brahmins have claimed the ultimate authority over sexuality unti l relatively recent times, and in many ways they still do. She makes many good points about t heir assumption of dominion in this area of human life. Why should a priest legislate sexuality? There are two sides to this question : Why should a priest want to interfere in this area, and why should people allow him t o do so? The answer to the first side is that sexuality is among the most basic of human needs, th e key to the survival of human life. To control sexuality means to control everything that ste ms from it — politics, power, everything. Moreover, that very same fact — that this force i s so deeply imbedded in the human organism — suggests the answer to the second side of t he question."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"For sexuality, like death, is an area of great vulnerability, mystery, danger; it is, ul timately, inaccessible to reason or to science. This is the shadowy place in whic h people feel a need for religion, where priests are invited to enter in or offer to enter in. The sexual connection between god(s) and humans is often envisioned as a kin d of marriage — the hieros gamos of the ancient world, the nun’s wedding to Jesu s — or as sexuality — the gloss on the Song of Songs, Bernini’s Saint Theresa, and so forth. B ut it is also envisioned as divorce or adultery. God’s abandonment of his worshippe r and human adultery often become metaphors for one another. Stories about human women and men become inextricably entangled in the t oils of human sexual tragedy and take flight in the illusion provided by myth. But the banal and the magical are by no means mutually exclusive, for the royal road that connects myt h and experience is a two-way stretch. The myth is a bridge between the actual h uman sexual experience and the fantasy that grows out of that experience and in turn trans figures it. The meanings of these myths must be sought not merely in the superfic ial anthropomorphic forms and quasi-human events but in darker theological qu estions. Irrationalization occurs in mythology when ideas about men and women are transfor med into myths about gods and goddesses, but the opposite process, rationalization, is equally common and important, when ideas about gods and goddesses are translated into myt hs about men and women. Gender plays a central role in the wider religious concern with order. Br oadly speaking, a structuralist might say that, in religious thinking, gender/sexuality = c ulture/nature. Religious communities and dogmas tend to disqualify the pieces that don’ t fit their paradigm; if the paradigm is defined as male (as it usually is), they discard or devalue the female (or the homosexual, or the bisexual). Thus, women (and, sometimes, eu nuchs or bisexuals) are usually cast as the villains in the founding myths dealing wi th such central religious topics as death, evil, and disease. Traditional religions regard sexuality as, overwhelmingly, heterosexuality. What homosexual themes there are in traditional myths are seldom overt, because such myths almost always have, as a latent agenda, the biological and spiritual survival of a particul ar race, in both senses of the word: race as contest and as species (\"us against them\"), the \"outnumber-them\" agenda (\"be fruitful and multiply\"). Such myths regard homosexual acts as potentially subversive of this agenda (or, at the very least, irrelevant to i t, perhaps not part of the problem, but certainly not part of the solution). The ascetic aspects of Hinduism and Christianity, among other religions, cr eate a violent dichotomy between heterosexual marriage, in which sexuality is tolerated for the sake of children, and the renunciant priesthood, in which asceticism is id ealized and sexuality entirely rejected, or at least recycled. In this taxonomy, homosexual love repr esents what Mary Douglas has taught us to recognize as a major category error, something that does n’t fit into any existing conceptual cubbyhole, \"matter out of place\" (in a word, dir t). (Here we may do well to recall the ways in which homophobic language often employs \"dir t\" symbolism.) Traditional religious texts regard homosexual union not, like het erosexual marriage, as a compromise between two goals in tension (procreation and asce ticism), but"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"as a mutually polluting combination of the worst of both worlds (sterili ty and lust). The myths therefore seldom explicitly depict homosexual unions at all, let al one sympathetically. Other mythologies of sex and gender are not necessarily open to more liberal c onstructions of gender than our own; some of them are simply open to different construct ions from ours. Yet the very fact that they explore options that we have not even considere d gives them the power to make us notice the ways in which our own religious trad itions legislate, often without our conscious knowledge, our sexuality. Occupations associated with Hera include: boardmember chairperson faithful spouse \"first mate\" first lady heir hostess housewife investor landlady matron mother monarch patroness philanthropist queen \"rich bitch\" visionary widow wife EMOTIONAL IMAGE Most of her stories are connected with her relationship with Zeus . Some evidence in texts that a more equal power relationship than that presented in Homer. Her a's main spheres of influence are marriage, weddings and childbirth. The divine marr iage, hieros gamos, is critical to her cult (cf., Iliad XIV.152-353). Hera shares with Gaia certain powe rs and conflict with the male. Version that Hera created Typhon; Birth of He phaistos; Attempted overthrow of Zeus by Hera, Poseidon and Athena. Inherent dichotomy and contrad iction in Hera (inversion of the good wife) seen in her: Marriage; Relationship w ith her children; Story of Ixion reflects her ties to the patriarchy. The emotional dynamics of Hera revolve around being perfected or thwarted in her mission. When she is thwarted she is essentially animus-possessed an d rages against her \"persecutors.\" She becomes over identified with her own masculine aggr essive side, and paradoxically rejects her own feminine identity. She may be the victim of a negative mother complex, and be too one-sided. Hera's jealousy is extreme enough to be called pathological. She doesn't have jeal ousy as an emotion. Hera is this archetypal form of jealousy of the spouse's attention. To f eel this feeling is a form of merging with the goddess -- an epiphany. But it may feel more like being possessed by a demon or the \"green-eyed monster.\" On the positive side, Hera embodies the feminine portion of the transpe rsonal authority, the Self. Inner contact with this archetype for a woman is an experience of the core of her"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"being. To be in harmony with herself, she must serve this inner dynamism . We can view this modern worship of Hera by giving her our attention. A neurotic or under-developed man would have to come to terms with the aut horitarian aspect of the mother-complex. A man involved in developing his \"femi nine\" side would serve Hera over and against the logos principle, listening to his heart as we ll as his head. This is generally a stage in the psychic life of men whose quest for the Sel f culminates in the PUER/SENEX reunion, which expresses itself through \"masculine\" s ymbolism (see Chapter XXI). The man in touch with the deep values of spousal intim acy is her 'hero.' The fulfillment and wholeness of Zeus and Hera consists of a dyadic relat ionship. \"Being a couple\" is her big deal! They are two-in-one, contained by their relations hip, unless possessiveness flares up. If they become estranged emotionally, she may rep ress the direct expression of her sexuality, projecting onto Zeus the fulfillment of her repressed desires. He manifests it through an affair. Psychologically, the \"other woman,\" so despise d, represents unknown aspects of her own being. Hera wants to be in the presence of her beloved, because she derives her f ulfillment through involvement. She always expects a deeper commitment from her sp ouse than she will ever get, however. The intense involvement is not always pleasant. Zeus and Hera are the types who figure that \"negative attention is better than no attention\" in their exchanges. Hera is first and foremost the dutiful wife of Zeus. We might call her t he wife of the CEO of Mt. Olympus. She is as potent of a directing force as he is. But in a patriarch al society her powers tend to appear in negative forms. Managerial ability can become an exaggerated urge to control or have power over those closest at hand -- the family, wh o tend to resent it. Zeus is notoriously promiscuous, and Hera directs a great deal of animosity at Ze us and his mortal and immortal paramours. Hera can be both jealous (internal) and vind ictive (extroverted). She must have been kept pretty busy by Zeus' philande ring. She must have been in a perpetual tizzy, because the number of his liaisons is legen dary. But Zeus had no immunity against the onslaughts of Hera! The masculine principle, as r epresented by Zeus, is far from omnipotent when challenged by her powerful contrary princip le. Hera is repeatedly the victim of her own powerful emotions. The volcanic qu ality of her animus (inner masculinity) is embodied in Hephaistos, her lame son. Th is issue of parthenogenesis was conceived without a father, from her jealous brooding. A s such, he came to rule volcanic activity, both physical and emotional. When moody, Hera is c apable of veritable explosions of strong emotions. Hera is outspoken and she has a judgmental, scolding tongue. But she is not always overt in her attacks. Despite her moral indignation at the behavior of others, she is m ore than willing to manipulate the feelings of others to suit her own needs and de sires. The Hera personality is seen in the grande dame type of woman. She is given to large sse or charitable activities. She has an aristocratic aura which assumes a right to c ommand, both activities and attention. She is born-to-order and scarcely questions thi s destiny as anything"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"other than her rightful position in life. She may express herself thr ough becoming a patron of the arts, or an administrator, (for example, a Dean of Women, or Board Member).

Many find these qualities present in former First Lady, Nan cy Reagan. Before her, the personality of Jackie Kennedy fascinated the world. Hera prefers to grapple with concrete details, rather than muse on int ellectual theories or abstractions. This can be valuable in coordinating an estate where there is al ways much to be done.

Q: Silly as this may seem, I have this internal str uggle going on between my own \"whom does the grail serve\" between Aphrodite and Hera. I have been \"cla imed\" by Aphrodite early and could not imagine a life without her beauty, strength, passion, dignity and sensuality that she has graced me with being a woman...But, I feel this other great pull of wantin g to attract a life-mate. Certainly not Zeus with a ll his philandering, but, I know Aphrodite wasn't thrilled exactly her \"partner\" or the whole \"till death do us part ritual\" either and dallied around, quite nicel y, thank you! And Hera was the one to call for the sacred marriage and also the queen of the Gods. So, how do I get the best of both worlds here? I want the two together and yet they seem so opposed. Plea se help me out here. - DIVINELY DEVOTED Dear \"Divinely Devoted,\" Your question does not seem silly at all. It's an i mportant one. You have articulated something that l ots of women feel, especially since we have \"cultural r einforcement\" (through media images, movies, etc.) that we should use Aphrodite's talents only as a me ans to lead to Hera's hieros gamos (sacred marriage), but not use the Goddess of Love's gifts after the altar. Aspects of both archetypes resonat e with most women: how do we live with the tension be tween \"loyal mate,\" keeper of the fidelity flame, and \"sensual lover,\" the generative, female sexual spark--which may not be so easy to limit to just on e partner? I think the answer to your question \"Whom does the grail serve?\" is: both of them, if you wan t a long-term relationship. Their realms are not as \" opposed\" as they might seem on first glance. And Aphrodite's stories highlight important points abou t how to keep a life-mate, whether male or female, interested for the long haul. APHRODITE AND THE SACRED MARRIAGE OF ZEUS AND HERA In Book Five of Homer's Iliad, Zeus alludes to the realm of \"marriage\" as Aphrodite's sphere of expertise. He says to her: \"Not to you, my child, have been given the works of war; you, rather, should attend to the charming works of marriage.\" (lines 428-30) It was Aphrodite who helped to save Hera and Zeus's marriage, by loaning Hera her Magic Girdle. Zeus could not resist his Queen when she was so fet chingly clad in the Love Goddess's lingerie; although Zeus had strayed (115 times!), he returned to Hera from his philandering thanks to the seductive girdle. Hera and Aphrodite's purpose is u nited in this story: to save the sacred cosmic marriage. This myth implies that Aphrodite is neces sary to a marriage; Aphrodite's gifts helped Hera keep her marriage to the King of the Cosmos alive. Charming one's partner, even after years of marriage, is vital, according to this myth. Aphrodi te and Hera went head-to-head on more political issues such as the beauty contest judged by Paris t hat became the beginning of the Trojan War (Grimal 192). But in terms of preserving the \"hieros gamos, \" the goddesses were in accord. APHRODITE'S MARRIAGE"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"But what of Aphrodite's own marriage? As you astute ly point out, Dear Reader, she cheated on her lame husband Hephaestus by having a number of love affairs, the most famous ones with: Ares, the God of War; Hermes, the Trickster God of Communicat ion and Commerce; Adonis, the younger hunk; and Anchises, the hottie in the hills. I think the message here is that as the Goddess of Love, she ha d to spread love around--to reach difficult arenas like war, via the realms of communication and business, the young and the old, with immortals and mortals a like. Although she was not faithful, her marriage was a source of power for Aphrodite. After all, she was married to a son of Zeus, and her husband loved her. Truly, madly, deeply. Hephaestus was jealous of Ares. According to Homer' s Odyssey [Book Eight], when Hephaestus contrived to catch Aphrodite cheating with Ares, he built a magic net which was hung as a trap over the Love Goddess's bed. Although Hephaestus was lam e, a wound he received when either his mother or father threw him from Olympus (both versions of his lameness are in the Iliad), the smithy was ingenious and creative. His web caught the lovers i n flagrante delicto; the gods in Olympus came to see the cheaters on display, all but Poseidon laugh ing at them (Friedrich 63). Some mythographers have interpreted this \"lovers trap\" scene as a symbol of shame brought on her husband by Aphrodite; in othe r words, that the expression of female sexuality beyo nd the boundaries of marriage will bring public embarrassment--ridicule due to cuckolding. Aphrodite expert Paul Friedrich, however, sees the \"lovers trap\" scene as possibly illustrating Aphrodite's complete freedom from shame, in that sh e is allowed to go on her merry way afterwards with no change in status: a sign of her own high st ature in Olympus and the power of love. In The Meaning of Aphrodite, Friedrich comments, too, that Book Eight of the Odyssey \"raises serious questions about the symbolism of the relations betw een Aphrodite and Hephaestus\" (64). Friedrich sees some significant positive elements in the A-H union . Friedrich asserts that far from lame, Hephaestus is one virile guy with a lot to offer a sexy gal: \"his bellows as testicles, his hammer as a phallus, the gold he works as semen, and the fire of his great forge as the lust of sex\" (65). This is not a guy who needed any sexual coaching; he sired lots of childr en, and not only with his wife. Aphrodite is an ear th goddess who ascends to the sky; Hephaestus is a sky god who is cast below. Together, they move heaven and earth. She loves gold; he makes gold jew elry. Also, Aphrodite is dominant in their relationship, which doesn't sound like a bad deal. So Aphrodite's own marriage has strengths that are often overlooked."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"LEARNING FROM THEIR STORIES.

Easy divorce has not been an option, historically speakin g. It is basically a new phenomenon. We are so casual in modern society that relationship s are considered \"disposable\" or re-cyclable through serial relationship s. With a 50% divorce rate for baby-boomers, and a 70% divorce rate for Gen-X, we have quickie \"no-fault \" do- it-yourself divorce. Since the state of mind of the spouses is not identical coming into th e marriage, there are usually differences in the adjustment to marriage. Differences in tempo, maturity, and in the degree of spiritual development are typically causes of difficulty, acc ording to Jung. One partner is generally more psychologically complex than the other. This partner is frequently capable of much faster spiritual growth, but may be erratic. The spouse who is grounded in a positive relationship to the parents can ge nerally adapt better. They are not hindered by a deep-seated unconscious tie to the p arents as divine,"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"god-like beings. They have successfully emancipated and therefore are mor e mature. They come into marriage as adults rather than \"adult children.\" A complex nature has many facets, and this personality may seek to realize many of them as symbolized by the impulsive promiscuity of Zeus. Versatility and spontan eity may have a certain charm, but it can mask an underlying impulsiveness. Jung thought that a woman's spiritual life was contained in her relation ship to her husband. Conversely, a man is contained emotionally in his wife, according to h is notion. This may have been an accurate observation in his day of more traditional gender m odels. However, the alternative lifestyle movement has produced many spiritu ally-oriented persons with commitments outside the Dyad. For example, a woman devotee of a spi ritual Master obviously is not wholly contained spiritually by her husband. He does not contain her entire spiritual animus projection. She sees it in all her relati ons with significant others. Likewise, a man involved in intensive social action such as counseling, has a vigorou s emotional life outside the home. These divided loyalties are actually healthier than the all-or-nothing pr oposition of having no essential obligations or binding interests outside of the marriage. Ne vertheless, the simpler spouse has the advantage of undividedness. The other spouse may en vy this condition, feeling outside the marriage. This can become problematical, s ince it awakens longing for that particular bliss. Maybe the spouse begins to fantasize it can be found in another lover. Hera has rad ar for such impulses, and her insecurities are painfully aroused. The spect er of rivals begins to appear on the horizon. Driven inward by disappointment, the spouse may beco me desperate or violent, exploding in a spasm of rage and manipulative tactics. For ced to turn inward, the individual may be lucky enough to find an inner self-suffici ency which was latent potential all along. As the possibilities of inner integration become more apparent to b oth spouses, they have the possibility of achieving the experience of an undivided self. Thi s is a quantum leap in consciousness which is equivalent to a metamorphosis. This stage cannot come without confrontation of the anima/animus. The constant animosity depicted in the Z eus-Hera configuration has a telos or goal. Every phase of life has its particular psychological goals as well as physical change s. One can always hope to be surprised in marriage by having one's own complexities ans wered by a corresponding diversity. But progress may also be arrested at any stage of development with no further breakthroughs. Things get stuck; there is a \"stale-mate.\" Consider the divorce rate. Individual capacities for adjustment vary. Remember, Hera remarries Ze us over and over again. You might think they are trying to get it right. Is the third time the c harm? There is pathology associated with this archetype including tragedy, yearnin g, jealousy, vindictiveness, and shrewishness. In the extreme, it may lead to homici de. Hera is shrewd."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"This behavior, though inherent in her nature, is motivated by the attitud e and behavior of her roaming spouse, Zeus. It is purely reactionary, based on her compulsive, overwhelming need. He neve r seems to settle down, content with the domestic routines. When he persecute s her, through neglect or his affairs, she is distraught. She reacts so strongly that she even become s self-defeating and self-destructive. In her negative phase, Hera is possessed by her anim us reactions. In myth she gave reactionary birth to many monster children, conceived by he rself in the lonely brooding of rejection. She projected this rejection by Zeus into the form of her own son, Hephai stos. He is born of the primal Virgin-Mother. His birth as a separate entity means she lost t he possibility of developing her own deeply introverted creative processes. If she could onl y have gotten a meaningful job. She winds up rejecting her son as Zeus rejected her, passing on her rejection and abandonment issues inter-generationally. With Prometheus, another son, she gave birth to her rebellious opposition to t he dominion of Zeus, meaning she expelled her ability to gain in ego-consciousness. Prom etheus later has his own rebellious acts and conflicts with Zeus, carrying on the fam ily tradition. The combative Ares was the embodiment of her bloodthirsty rage, her egotism , and her jealousy. Ares' warlike nature is an instinct which has wreaked havoc on man kind. Finally, Hera goes really psychotic and expels the monster Typhon. As this reptilian G odzilla-like beast, she goes through a radical regression to the most primitive level, burs ts all fetters and runs amok. With no limit to her destructive capabilities who knows wh at damage she might do. At this point, the only hope is mitigation or litigation. Perhaps it is time f or another purification and transformation through a renewal of the sacred aspect of marriage. In the Argive legends, Hera was known as \"goddess of the yoke\" and the meaning of yoga is \"yoking\" or \"union.\" In this sense, marriage is a yoga, an arena for spiritual develop ment. On the positive side, Hera was also Mother of the Charities (Faith, Hope, and Love ), gaining thereby her affinity for charitable work. Those identified too strongly with their persona as wife need to tap the de ep resources of the animus. No one can be reduced to their role, such as merely wife, mothe r, breadwinner, etc. If a Hera-type has married a philander or liar they will become frus trated and embittered. Even so, guilt or duty or other feelings may prevent them leaving a b ad marriage. She represses her natural response. She may sublimate her rage in manu al or mental work, rather than allowing herself to truly feel the energy and transmute it. If abandoned, she may have trouble believing that the loss is permanent. She believes in the fantasy of his return and eventual reconciliation. This denial prevents grieving and b locks her process of recovery. The alchemical notion of \"the chymical wedding\" returns marriage to i ts spiritual side as a participating factor in personal transformation. Karen-Claire Voss Uses imagery from the Rosarium Philosophorum to illustrate this. Both the texts and the iconography of the"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"alchemical tradition of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are filled with allusions to ‘the chymical marriage,’ and some of the most beautiful and compelli ng images in the texts depict the conjunction of opposites as a royal marriage. These description s and images occur with sufficient frequency to warrant comparison with the hie rosgamos (sacred marriage), as understood in the discipline of history of religions. We encou nter the idea of the hierosgamos even before we embark on a hermeneutical discussion of th e images that the work contains in the History of Religions. The term hierosgamos is used generally to refer to the union between two d ivinities, or between a human being and a god or goddess, or between two human beings (under c ertain special conditions); more particularly, it is used to refer to the ritu alized, public sexual union between the king and a hierodule (‘sacred prostitute’) in anc ient Mesopotamia. This union was accompanied by the belief that the human partners became di vine by virtue of their participation in it. It was thought, for example, that the priestes s who took part in this ritual became the goddess Inanna in the same way as ordinary bread and wine are thought to become the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the Roman Catholic celebr ation of the Eucharist. Both ritual forms entail regeneration and transformation; in Mesopotamia, the hierosgamos was thought to insure the well-being of the king, the prosperit y of the people, and the continued fertility of the land. The belief that human beings could participate in the ontological condit ion of divinity through sexual union, through the body, is exceedingly ancient, but the hierosga mos is not merely an important element in an archaic religious tradition. It is also exc eedingly persistent And, in my view, its persistence indicates more than a me rely superficial connection between its manifestations in the ancient Near East and in t he West; it has become associated with a spectrum of symbolic meanings so rich and comp elling that they continue to reassert themselves over and over again. Although the hierosgamos d id not find its way into the official teachings of Christianity, for example, it is prese nt nonetheless in the symbolism of Mary as the Bride of Christ. The major difference between the significance of the hierosgamos in t he ancient Near East and the Christian West is that its expression in the former context was b ound up with an explicit, embodied praxis that necessitated ritual sexual union. This gi ves rise to certain hermeneutical difficulties. Scholars of religion sometimes deny or i gnore the presence of the hierosgamos idea, or pronounce its use as a conceptual category invalid. Even t hose who do recognize its presence may yield to the prevailing wisdom that enc ourages the substitution of a part for the whole, and thus interpret the hierosgam os according to an allegedly higher, spiritualized ideal, having nothing to do with the body. An alogous interpretations are offered for the hierosgamos theme in alchemical te xts. Yet, many of the alchemists appear to have undergone a complex experience involving mutual rec iprocity between the events in the laboratory and within themselves of a kind that h arkens back to, and carries forward, the imprint of a religious tradition that combined ph ysical and spiritual levels of transformation. A core of meanings associated with the hierosgamos that have persisted cros s-culturally. If anything, the symbolism became enriched by the addition of Christian d octrines, especially that of the Incarnation, which signified the union of human and divine. Many al chemical texts like the Rosarium insist on the interrelatedness of body and sp irit. In seeking the"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"‘conjunction of opposites’ the alchemists were attempting to overtur n the conventional conceptual dichotomization between spirit and body, and to offer in its p lace models that reflected their intuitions of ontological wholeness. Therefore, when interpreting the hierosgamos theme in the context of the alchemical tradition we should k eep in mind the fact that it is generally meant to include the body; it signifies not only ide aliter but also realiter. An adequate hermeneutics of alchemical iconography can do just ice to the multivalence of the hierosgamos images in texts like the Rosarium only by se eking to encompass the totality of their symbolic meanings. The Rosarium Philosophorum contains twenty-one images, fifteen exhibit the hierosgamos in more or less explcit form; three others contain it implicitly. Figu re 1 shows a fountain fitted with three spigots. The waters are the key to unlocking the meani ng of this image, for the text explains that the waters flowing from each are really a single water --‘of which and with which our magistery is effected.' The three waters evoke a hierog amy described in the Enuma Elish?, a Mesopotamian creation myth from around 1900 b.c.e., which relates how the primordial waters of Tiamat, ‘she who bore them all,’ and Apsu, ‘their b egetter . . . commingle as a single body,’ and thus become the sole matrix from which eve rything emerges. The verse accompanying the figure heightens the correspondenc e between the alchemical fountain and the hierogamy that produced all life: ‘We (waters ) are the metal’s first nature and only source; the highest tincture of the Art is made through us.’ In Figure 2 we see a king and queen dressed in elaborate robes. Each holds a stal k ending in two flowers. He stands upon the sun, she on the crescent moon. Alt hough their separateness is symbolically emphasized, they clasp hands as if to prefi gure the ‘chymical marriage.’ A dove -- at once a mediating symbol as well as a further link w ith the hierosgamos, since it was associated both with Eros and with the powerfu l female divinities of the ancient Near East --is shown hovering above them, holding its own stalk which perfectly intersects the cross formed by those held by the king and q ueen. In Figure 3 the pair is naked; but, still wearing separate crowns, they proffer to one anothe r a flower on a long stalk. The banner over the king's head reads: ' O Luna, let me be thy husband '; the one over the queen's reads: ' O Sol, I must submit to thee. ' Once more, the dove appears between them, a flower in its beak. In Figure 5, we see the king and queen in sexual embrace. Figures 6-9 show the king and queen in hermaphroditic form, indicating successively deepening leve ls of conjunction, and depict them lying in a sepulcher. Their bodies are joined; they have two h eads, but now wear a single crown. Figure 11 is explicitly sexual. The king and queen, each winge d, wear two crowns, and are submerged in water. Their limbs are entwined; her han d grasps his phallus; his left hand fondles the nipple of her breast; his righ t is under her neck, supporting her. Figure 17 depicts the product of the union between th e alchemical opposites in the form of the Hermetic androgyne. This offspring is not simp ly the end result of the marriage of opposites. Figure 18 shows the lion eating the sun. It is itse lf an implicit hierogamy because it is not fully differentiated from its parents, and continues to participate in its hierogamic beginnings. Figure 19 provides an excellent example of the occasional coalescence of alch emical symbols and Christian symbols.

Third, the Incarnation of the Son entails an ontological condition of s imultaneous humanity and divinity--a profound manifestation of hierogamy. Like the marriage between the alchemical opposites, all these unions r equire mediation. In the alchemical marriage, this function is often performed by Mercu rius, whom Jung calls a ‘mediating symbol par excellence’; in the Rosarium , however, we have already seen the dove in the role of mediator. In this figure we see it in that role too, poised above the crown that the Father and Son are about to place on Mary's head; it is now associated wi th the third person of the Trinity. The fact that the dove was a symbolic attribute of the female divinities of the ancient near east underscores the con-clusion that Figure 19 is also a hierogamic image, albeit in Christianized form. Figure 20, the last image in the series, depicts the risen Christ. In h is left hand, he holds a banner marked with a cross; his right gestures toward the now empty sepu lchre. That sepulchre unmistakably indicates that the completed alchemical pr ocess has involved the transformation, not the transcendence, of the body. For if the alchemical wor k necessitated the transcendence of the body, one would not expect to find an empty tomb, but a t omb filled with the putrefying remains of the king and queen. Instead, we see the risen Christ, the embodiment of the hierogamic union between human and divine. In the view of the alchemist who wrote the Rosarium Philosophorum , the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body signified, not the suppression, or even the tran scendence, of the physical body, but its glorification and perfection. It is not surprising that the author of the Rosarium Philosophorum chose images of the hierosgamos to help convey something of the exquisitely subtle reciprocit y invoked in the alchemical coniunctio. The hierosgamos images of alchemy are profoundly eloque nt expressions of the experience of the true adepts as they moved through th e later stages of the work. For those alchemists, all the elements of ordinary experience w ere sacralized. The Philosopher’s Stone could be found everywhere; it was ‘walked on, ch ildren play with it’; it is familiar to all (people) both young and old, is found in the country, i n the village, in the town. Perhaps we are still capable of learning from the alchemists that what tr ansforms common substance, that which is familiar to all, is no more – and no less – than a deepe r apprehension of the significance of the Hermetic motto: ‘What is above is just as what is below.’ This motto, so often quoted and equally often misunderstood, requi res that we understand the radical implications of a ‘whole from which nothing is excluded.’ (Voss http://www.trinity.edu/mgarriso/Myth/MythSyllabus.html#top ).

She gets married in church or the Temple, not in Reno or by the Justice of the P eace. It is consecration, dedication, and consummation -- a eucharistic act. The main s piritual content of Hera revolves around the hieros gamos, or sacred marriage. On a personal level thi s means the reuniting of spirit, soul, and body. It indicates a full knowled ge of both the heights (Zeus) and depths (Hera) of one's character. When the hieros gamos is consummated in our daily lives, it means that we have learned to apply our insight s in practice. When Jung speaks about the royal marriage, he tells us that the queen symboliz es the body, the king stands for the spirit, and the soul unites the two. There fore, our psyche is a half bodily and half spiritual substance. When king and queen (animus /anima) are united, they form a magical hermaphroditic being which is a union of opposite ener gies. We need to be related to another individual, according to Jung, to experience the full de pth of our own psyche. From an internal perspective, spiritual marriage is an inner experien ce which is not projected onto another living individual. In the royal marriage of the soul with the Self, the projections of anima and animus have been returned to their proper level in the unconscious. We do not make our mate carry an essentially religious function for us anymore. The King and Queen are united, or conjoined, synthesizing the opposit es. But this cannot happen until one masters the problem of unconscious desirou sness. When the opposites to be united are the masculine consciousness (of our day worl d) and the feminine unconscious (the night world), this royal marriage is a transcendent symb ol of the Self, and embodies the psychic totality of personal wholeness. These statements need not be confused with erroneous notions concer ning the so-called \"soul-mate.\" Each individual has a complete soul, and is a divine spark. But when we choose to cast our lot with a life-mate there is a synergetic effect which transcends the qualities of the individuals involved, bringing a portion of the divine int o manifestation. It is not that a long-lost mate is rediscovered after separation on a higher plane. R ather, that"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"two compatible souls commit themselves to furthering the development of loving compassion in one another. From the archetypal perspective, the whole obje ct of marriage is to reach God. Thus marriage is seen as a creative process of love where two sou ls care for one another in a reciprocal manner, furthering mutual spiritual aims. Therefore, the Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera means self-actualization with in the boundaries provided by the institution of marriage. Our partners are no longe r required to live our own unlived potential. Through withdrawl of projection onto th e partner, we actualize our own potential. Thus we find meaning in \"the battle of the s exes.\" We discover our own madness, as well as our own unique spirit. This creates an increase d sense of interiority which might be viewed as a thalamus or bridal chamber, a place wh ere opposites merge. According to Joseph Campbell, \" Myth helps you to put your mind in touch with this experience of being alive. It tells you what the experience is. Marriage, for exam ple. What is marriage? The myth tells you what it is. It's the reunion of the separated duad. O riginally you were one. You are now two in the world, but the recognition of the spiritual identi ty is what marriage is. . . . When people get married because they think it's a long-time love af fair, they'll be divorced very soon, because all love affairs end in disappointment. But marriage i s recognition of a spiritual identity. . . . By marrying the right person, we recon struct the image of the incarnate God, and that's what marriage is. The internal union of hieros gamos helps ensure the external reunion in a primary relationship. By discovering split s within myself and healing them, I prepare for a spiritual identity. Otherwise my partner end s up carrying the burden of Eve, Helena, Mary or Sophia to compensate for my unresolved anima issues . \" How does one choose the right person? Your heart tells you. It ought to. Your inn er being. That's the mystery. You recognize your other self? Well, I don't know, but there's a flash that comes, and something in you knows that this is the one. The Intuitive Sel f knows when the spiritual partner arrives. By attending to the moment, I will have the pe rceptiveness to recognize the flash when it comes. If I am not listening, the flash wil l come and go without my noticing it. Why is it that marriage is so precarious in our modern society? Be cause it's not regarded as a marriage. I would say that if the marriage isn't a first priority in y our life, you're not married. The marriage means the two that are one, the two become one flesh. If the marriage lasts long enough, and if you are acquiescing constantly to it instead of to i ndividual personal whim, you come to realize that that is true - the two really are one. Pr imarily spiritually. The biological is the distraction which may lead you to the wrong i dentification. According to Campbell, the necessary function of marriage, perpetuating ou rselves in children, is not the primary one; that's really just the elementary aspe ct of marriage. There are two completely different stages of marriage. First is the youthful marriage following the wonderful impulsethat nature has given us in the interplay of the sexes b iologically in order to produce children. But there comes a time when thechild graduate s from the family and the couple is left. Marriage is a relationship. When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you're sac rificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship.

And that's a purely mythological image signifying the sacrific e of the visible entity for a transcendent good. This is something that becomes be autifully realized in the second stage of marriage, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two exper iencing that they are one. . . It's primarily a spiritual exercise, and the society is supposed to help u s have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in t he service of man. We presume we make a commitment for better or for worse. That's the r emnant of a ritual. And the ritual has lost its force. The ritual that once conveyed an inn er reality is now merely form. And that's true in the rituals of society and in the pers onal rituals of marriage and religion. (Campbell).

There are discussions around issues such as Sacred Marriage: Re lationship as Immortality. All our cultural experience and individual conscious existe nce depends on the fabric of life, the germ line, and this comes not from male dominion, but from the mutual sexual relationship between the two genders. In this relationship, the female stands central as the sole bearer of cytoplasmic inheritance and the principal investor i n time and resources. However the male likewise contributes genetically in ful l and pivotal share. Immortality is thus not the domain of one gender but of the relationship bet ween woman and man. Cultures which fail to respect these socio-biological realiti es lead to gender oppression, especially the repression of women. Attunement with the immortal continuity of life likewise comes fr om the relationship between woman and man, not from one gender alone. Each sex is sterile on its own and mortal as individuals. The family relationship is an embodiment of this on going immortal web of life. Relationship is conceived spiritually in the form of 'holy mat rimony', the harmony that is produced from the creative relationship between woman and man. It is thus the sacred marriage in which we find God and Gaia, the Feminine fac e of deity, in divine union. The healing of the epoch of male dominion requires mankind to atone for the e rrors of his ways and come to terms of learning, healing and new wisdom, but true liberati on arises from reconciliation, not dominion in any form, male or female. The embodimen t of reconciliation is forgiveness and the celebration of it is the sacred marr iage. This marriage is by definition one in true freedom for each gender. That is its very sacre dness - its complete freedom, combined with the devoted commitment to one ano ther the marriage expresses. This is a paradox of trust. It does not imply any form of possession. Solom on did not possess the Queen neither she him. The Bridegroom archetype is in a sense the heroic journey of every shaman on t he vision quest, every budding troubadour, and every knight of courtly love, from Dumuzi through Adonis to Lancelot."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Inanna sang: \"Make your milk sweet and thick, my br idegroom. My shepherd, I will drink your fresh milk. Wild bull, Dumuzi, make your milk sweet and thick. I will drink your fresh milk.... The Jewish messiah is also a fully-human figure, traditionally a heroic pri est or king who performs genuine social redemption of his people - inspiring long-te rm future goodness. David, Solomon and Cyrus represent different forms of 'anointed' or messi ah, with Solomon figuring very strongly as the Bridegroom in his renowned sacred marri age with the Queen of Sheba, which is the subject of the Song of Songs, perhaps t he most fertile passage ever written in both the mountains of sexual spice and the image of th e beloved as the progenitor of fertility: \"Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up fr om the washing, whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren one among them\" I rose up to open to my beloved and my hands droppe d with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdraw n himself and was gone: my soul failed when he spake : I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer Later Jesus adopted the Bridegroom archetype in the prophecy of Isaiah 61 in pronouncing his manifestation at the Nazareth synagogue, for which he was nearly thrown of f a cliff. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sewn in it to spring forth so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. This set the tradition on to a new extreme Zoroastrian form of cosmic renovat or, Jesus promising the Kingdom as the messiah ofhistory redeeming the Earth fro m the sins of woman, stemming from Eve and the Fall - the son of man, the archetype of Adam: And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. This mission culminated in the Crucifixion, and the exaltation of Magdalen on the third day in the very tradition of Inanna repeating the very words of the Song of Songs call ing for the lost Adonis: 'Woman, why weepest thou?' She saith unto them, 'Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him' ... Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

However the fertility Bridegroom is a very different 'kettle of fish' f rom the ichthys of Christianity. Where Jesus was the bridegroom of the church on the marri age bed of the Cross, the fertility Bridegroom is the bridegroom of the immortal femi nine face, embodied in Gaia - the living earth. The fertility Bridegroom starts out by breaking all t he curses ever made against women: I unpronounce original sin. I unpronounce dominion over nature. I unpronounce the Anathema maranatha. I unpronounce the death curse on the witch. I unpronounce stoning for adultery or any other violent punishment. I apologise to all women for the sins of man. and promises to stand beside women and men of like spirit to safeguard the f uture of life: I vouchsafe to the immortal Feminine the troth of s acred marriage. I promise to stand by the Bride whatever the cost to culminate the patriarchal epoch for the future o f life on earth."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"This is literally turning the tables on the whole paradigm, giving not only wom en but men of like spirit, liberation from the binds of orthodoxy and the heritage of Arm ageddon. Women as a gender alone struggle to achieve an equality which will only be achie ved slowly world-wide because of ingrained patriarchal supremacy in diverse cultu res spanning all the continents. By the time eventual social change restores the freedom of women world-wide, nature will have been so damaged that our heritage of biodiversity will not be wi th us for the future of humanity and the unfolding of life. By forming a relationship now in which female and male meet in reconciliation, a broad consensus for feminine sustainability can be achieved in a way which would be impossible otherwise. It is possib le to combine vehement and oceanic support for women's liberation and empowerment wor ldwide with constructive gender engagement. Although the fertility principle and the sacred marriage rite extol s sexual union, life, birth and spring as symbols of life burgeoning forth, rather than the cult of deat h, fertility in this sense does not imply rampant sexual reproduction, but furthering the on going continuity of life into the unfolding future - what furthers the sustainable dive rsity of life. Fertility thus comes with natural moderation of population. A key to this is women having fr eedom of reproductive choice. The key role of the fertility Bridegroom is to act as a h ealing catalyst, in cooperation with women and men of like spirit, to save the world's livin g heritage for the unfolding future, by liberating the paradigm into the epoch of the Tree. T he key to the whole existential dilemma we face is saving as much of the diversity of life as possible now, so that those that follow us will have their rightful share of the diversity of life instead of a veritable genetic desert of our own making, caused by the selfishness an d greed of what is almost a single generation. King's group invites all women to join with with men of like spirit in f orming a feminine Wisdom democracy to conceive apocalypsia the bridal unveiling and to fulfill th e unfolding of the epoch of the Tree of Life, the liberation from prison of those that are bound and the Sakina of the dove of peace. I covenant to abide by the ethics and conception of this democracy in apocalypsia in respect of the principle that all of us in our vision and divinity are incarnation equals - living partners moving on the face of the deep. This is to end the tradition of the 'lord messiah' in being the humble follower of democracia - collective wisdom through peer review. This division of sexuality and spirituality is rather recent in the hi story of religious experience. In most pagan societies, sexuality is seen as an important aspe ct of uniting the spiritual with the physical and with the worship of gods and goddesses. I n many ancient cities, sacred prostitutes \"served\" at the temples in order to be the mediatrix between the gods and humans. One writer notes, Now certainly I am not suggesting that true sexuality and spirituality shoul d be untied in this way. After all, this was what the Apostle Paul was trying to straighten out in the C orinthian church because some of the believers were apparently still having intercourse with s acred prostitutes (I Cor."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"6:15-20). In order to correct this perversion, he encourages the cultivation of a sexual relationship in marriage as a prevention from this abundant \"sacred sex.\" Apparently, even the ma rried couples had become abstinent as an overreaction to the Corinthian extremes and had thrown the sexual relationship totally out of marriage. To this problem, Paul tells them to \"stop deprivi ng themselves,\" and to recultivate the sexual area of their marriage lest they be severely te mpted by the culture (or Satan). In similar fashion the Church has been reacting and overreacting on the re lation of sexuality to spirituality ever since."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS Juno (Roman) Lakshmi (Hindu) Parvati (Hindu) CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE In addition to now-passed Princess Diana, there are other famous Hera wome n whose husbands are wealthy and powerful enough to challenge the limits of t heir marriage. Ivanna Trump is another recent example; Jackie Onassis. Hera has never been psychologically far from our thoughts. She has appeared in th e political arena as the thorny problem of the ERA amendment. Increasing the political rights of women and ensuring equal pay for equal work, this Equal Rights Amen dment has not been able to prevail over the socially dominant patriarchy. It is interesting that Hera was known in the past as Era. Thus, she is th e underlying archetypal dominant of the ERA. All those wives and mothers proclaiming thei r equality in the paternal society are devotees of Hera. Working women who have experienced severe discrimination in the job market are now \"venting their spleens.\" DIALOGUE WITH HERA Through dialoguing with Hera, we can learn about our unconscious attitudes tow ard marriage or bonding with a spouse. She can show us how we subconscious ly are feeling toward our spouse or the institution of marriage at any given time. In active imagination she may appear as jealous, bitchy, vindictive, frustrated or argumentative, depending on how the primary relationship is going. At least, w hen you agree to dialogue with her, she gets Her voice, at last. She might appear as the ele gant bride, or celestial queen. If you have lost a loved one for whom you still grieve, she may appear as Hera Chera, who has lost her mate. She can also inform us about our individuation process when she is seen as th e Soul-as- Queen and her husband Zeus-the-King is Spirit. Watch your dreams for im ages of weddings and nuptial festivities. It is better for you to be a participati ng onlooker at these events, rather than the bride or groom. Imagining oneself as the King or Queen without the proper protection from archetypal identification is probably grandiose fantasy, rather than true transformat ive process work. This would mean your ego or personality is too strongly identified with th ese powerful archetypes, and this means being in a state of possession or compulsive domin ance of your life by the archetype. As an observer you can appreciate the Royal Marriage takin g place in your psyche with better results in daily life. If you are dating, and are really looking for a potential spouse, or if you are engaged and fantasize continually about your impending marriage, you can bet Hera is at work i n you."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"For Hera, the accent is on the marriage itself, where a goddess such as Dem eter primarily seeks a father for her children. If you are single and considering marriage, ask Hera in dialogue just what type ofsp ouse will fulfill her requirements for a multidimensional relationsh ip. But remember, with Hera there will always be something that is not quite right, some fatal flaw to s poil the nuptial bliss. Remember Hera was the most jealous woman in Greek mythology. Ask Hera about her feelings concerning all the aspects of your relationshi p which include physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual bonding. If your physical rel ationship is off you might want her to summon help from Aphrodite; if your spouse won't talk t o you about meaningful issues of the day, perhaps Athena could help. Gods and goddesses do not exist in vacuums or isolation. Once you are familiar wit h the basic cast of players, you inner dramas can have dynamic interaction of several arch etypes. They can dialogue with one another, as well as you. But, be careful--don't amas s too much power in one place at once or you will be overwhelmed and unable to integrate t he results of the exercise. If you have ever been divorced, dialogue with Hera concerning this event. She c an inform you about subconscious currents which brought the downfall of the marri age.

If you are single, do you find yourself continually \"siz ing up\" eligible members of the opposite sex as potential mates? 2. When you date(d) do you see several others simultaneously (Aphrodite or Don Ju an) or do you tend to focus on one lover at a time (serial monogamy)? 3. If you are married now, how do you feel consciously about your relationship on the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual levels? Be honest with you rself. Are you still as compatible as when you wed? Are your growth rates similar or is one partner overly dependent or immature? 4. In what ways does your commitment to relationship limit your sense of pers onal freedom (Zeus); how does it expand your potentials? 5. In Hera's cult, her marriage was periodically renewed. Can you do this with in the context of one primary relationship for a lifetime, or have you been remarrie d instead? Name 3 ways to keep the freshness of your marriage alive. 6. What makes the Hera-in-you jealous, vindictive, or explosive? Do you repress her s harp tongue, or vent your wrath? If so how do you deal with those feelings or resolve th e situation?"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"7. Divorce is also part of the Hera syndrome -- a sort of metaphorical ritual pur ification when an outworn relationship has turned poisonous.

Has the projection of your anima or animus ever fooled you into thinking you had met your soul-mate? Do you have romanticized notions about the soulmate? Each soul has th e potential for wholeness within itself. So partners may be well-suit ed but not necessarily \"fated\" for one another. This sense of destiny comes from projecting our soul onto another, which sometimes results in unrequited love. 9. Are other gods intruding on your human marriage so that Hera feels shortchanged in time or depth of relationship? For example, Aphrodite trying to steal one' s spouse, or Athena making one's spouse workaholic. Hephaistos might make a spouse seem dull and uninteresting, Demeter diverts most of the attention toward the chi ldren, while Dionysus upsets the home with crises produced by intoxication, and Artemis pref ers to be independent and live in solitude. 10. Have you ever had to deal with an adulterous spouse? How did you feel and react? Did it destroy your relationship, ultimately? How did you deal with rejection? 11. Can you remember any dreams of weddings from any period of your life? If so, what elements within yourself do you think were uniting? Consider the oute r circumstances at the time. You may dream of a positive experience of being the wedding partn er of a sacred figure. This is an inner experience of wholeness if there is a mysteri ous and divine emotional effect on you or you feel erotic bliss and union with the partner w hen it embraces you. This is a dream of the Sacred Marriage, which may foretell its actualization in the future, or just show its potential. It is a mystical reunion, which brings peace , yet is electrifying.

The Great Goddess had many lovers and was extremely independent until the arrival of the patriarc hal northern culture in the Mediterranean area (see Reisler's The Chalice and the Blade ). They brought their sky religion with its chief exponent, Zeus. After a 300 year courtship, the fusion of cultures was consummated by the h ieros gamos or Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera. Hera settled into her new role as exemplary wife , giving up her polyandrous lifestyle, but not her independence. She became th e pattern for all good married women, whose pasts are forgiven if not almost forgotten. Hera is there fore the patroness and guardian of the institution of marriage, as well as the legitim ate spouse of Zeus. Many of today's conjugal unions are about healing the millennial split be tween patriarchy and matriarchy -- the war of the sexes -- through gender reunion. Her authority over the marriage came from her originally wider intere st in the lives of women in general. She is also associated with certain aspects of fecundity an d childbearing, even though her union with Zeus was not characteristically fertile. She combines both earthy and lunar aspects in her personality, which mak es her both practical and soulful. Hera has a deep shadow nature, and she has the dubiou s distinction of being the most jealous character in mythology. It may seem strange to link Hera with \"The Hierophant,\" but not when cer tain elements are considered. The sacredness of marriage is stressed in all the major religions of the world as a means of channeling the instinct of sexual desire, and fulfillin g the mating instinct. The Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera also symbolizes wholeness of the individual personality. The Hierophant exemplifies this male-female wholeness. T his prefigures the spiritual marriage of the soul with the celestial Lord, where the human s oul is likened to a \"bride.\" In ancient times is marriage of god and mortal was celebrated anonymou sly with priestesses of the great goddess. \" The 'heiros gamos,' the sacred prostitute was the votary chosen to embody the godde ss. She was the goddess' fertile womb, her passion and her erotic nature. In the union with the god, embodied by the reigning monarch, she assured the fertility and well -being of the land and the people. . . she did not make love in order to obtain admiration or devotion from the man who came to her, for often she remained veiled and anonymous; her r aison d'être was to worship the goddess in lovemaking, thereby bringing the goddess love i nto the human sphere. In this union -- the union of masculine and feminin e, spiritual and physical -- the personal as transcended and the divine entered in. As the embodi ment of the goddess in the mystical union of the sacred marriage, the sacred prostitut e aroused the male and was the receptacle for his passion . . . .

Existentially, there are many kinds of marriages: those based on contracts, c hildren, shared interests, friendships, partnerships, polyamorous, alchemic al and soul unions. The best marriages put the union first, even above the children who then feel more secure. They are a combination of partnership, friendship, sexuality, nurturing, accep tance and spirituality. The link to the alchemical \"chymical marriage\" implies chemistry is significant. Nevertheless, marriage is a crucible of spiritual transfor mation. The Hierophant, the priest who joins people with one another and with God, is associated with the astrological sign Taurus, and shares traits with Hera. In her origi nal cult-forms she was known as the \"goddess of the yoke,\" \"rich in oxen\" (Taurus being the Bull), who kept sacred herds of cows. She is \"cow-eyed\" for her large brown eyes. As \"god dess of the yoke\" she prefigures the devotion to the sky principle seen in modern par ticipants in Yoga (which also means \"yoking\"). The trump is associated with the rules of obed ience and loyalty--to a guru, organization, work, country, etc. On the physical plane, Hera manifests as the mating instinct, child birth, parthenogenesis, and the flow of adrenaline especially in jealousy. Emotionally she reflect s the dual faces of marriage when perfected or thwarted. Divorce is the cognitive notion assoc iated with her, while her spiritual myth is the sacred marriage. As an Olympian, Hera was the daughter of Cronos and Rhea. She was the sister of Demeter, Hades, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus. She was mother of Ares, Arge, Disc ordia, Eleithyia, Hebe and Hephaistos, and probably Typhon. Hera knows how to play the societal game. She teaches and upholds the tradit ions of society, giving and receiving advice. When she wants to she displays loyalty, obedie nce, and discipline. She makes authoritative allies and draws on the powers of m oral law. Hera was famous for her tirades against her husband because of his philanderin g. The former plight of Princess Diana and her response to Prince Charles's affair was a classi c Hera role. PHYSICAL FORM Hera is a goddess distinguished by her great antiquity. Her name means sim ply 'Lady,\" and her original consort was known simply as 'Hero,\" or Lord. It is interesti ng to note that the very first temple at Mt. Olympus was hers. It dates from the secon d half of the 7th Century B.C. to 1000 B.C. She is also the official patroness of the OLYMPIC GAMES, which were or iginated by her muscular hero, Herakles (Hercules). The fact that his twelve labors we re in service to her is shown by his name being derived from her own. The stories and rites surrounding Hera indicate an instinctual backgrou nd as the mating instinct. The antiquity of the goddess shows the instinctual natur e of her origin. This instinct seeks fulfillment of a particular sort which will not be su blimated to other goals. It has very little to do with lust or sex, per se. If this instinct is forced to d eviate from its goal, it will instead turn negative, as Hera's personality shows."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"The wifehood of Hera seeks as her essential mode-of-being the requi red marital union with her spouse on several levels. She is not concerned merely with his physic al fidelity (although it would be nice), or his ability to father children upon her, or be a responsive parent to the children. Rather, she is driven by a compulsive necessity to be perfected through conjugal union. The instinct for a multi-level intimate relationship is natural. She wan ts to know the ins and outs of her spouse. Their union must include physical, emotional, psychologic al or intellectual, and spiritual levels. Curiously, like many \"royal couples,\" Hera and Zeus are both siblings and mates. T his royal marriage was literalized in ancient Egypt, through sibling consorts for t he pharaoh. This symbolism of brother/sister love represents the restoration of bi sexual totality. It is a psychological resolution of original brother/sister duality. They are aspect s of the same essence. Their re-union is expressed in an alchemical verse: White-skinned lady, lovingly joined to her ruddy-limbed husband, Wrapped in each other's arms in the bliss of connubial union, Merge and dissolve as they come to the goal of perfection: They that were two are made one, as though of one body. On a more practical level, Hera cannot abide having a \"token spouse\" or an official husband who periodically checks in while he carries on his life el sewhere. His proximity and commitment to her are critical. She embodies the desire for the arch etypal hieros gamos, or sacred marriage, which occurs between male and female on the physi cal, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual planes of experience. Even while dating, Hera is always looking for a potential spouse. Hera feels ess entially incomplete without a partner. Marriage to her means fulfillment and sat isfaction. In contrast the Amazon likes the \"thrill of the chase,\" while Aphrodite s eeks immediate physical gratification, and Athena companionship or perhaps a useful busi ness alliance. Though their essence is Feminine, these forces operate in both men and women. As wife, Hera wants to share her spouse's day-to-day activities. You bet she wan ts to stay abreast of the business dealings. Why, what if he should die, and she nee ds to take charge of the estate? If another archetypal priority supersedes the Hera drive, s he may avoid being prepared for such contingencies, yet fully able to take the reins of c ommand. Hera would probably prefer to have Zeus all to herself if her secret w ish were know, but then how could he be Zeus in such a context? If she got her wish, imagine how t hey would quarrel under such close confinement. Each are accustomed to maintai ning many outside interests. Besides, in any setting, Zeus cannot bring her to fulfillmen t as long as he carries her own unlived masculinity or animus. Hera wishes to experience depth of relationship with Zeus. To really do t hat, she needs to develop a relationship with her own animus, but that may seems too abstract . Inner work may not come naturally to her, but therapy may become her refuge if she be comes a dissatisfied wife. To her, marriage is no abstract institution."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"She does not wish Zeus to assert his independence from wedlock with her. She doesn't even wish him to turn inward on his own resources, as she probably needs to do. I f he follows his own inner feminine voice and becomes too introverted, she feels thwarte d in her fulfillment since he may become emotionally unavailable. He has turned inward to his brilliant daughter, Athena, his brainchild with all the ideas. Hera can also be jealous of her spouse's attention to real children, parents, j ob, or other relationships. This reaction veils an underlying fear of abandonment. The fact is that Hera and Zeus are mutually dependent on one another for the fulfillment of this basic drive, the mating instinct. Depending on the basic emotional adjustment of the personalities in the relationship, this will manifest as negative co-d ependence, positive inter-dependence, or a combination of these patterns. Marriage requires active listening, not just to the partner, but to one's d eep self. Problems in marriage reflect voices from the unconscious which need to be hear d. Marital problems are a product of the inner conflicts each of the partners bring to the relat ionship. But these very problems, which crop up in the marriage arena, reflect unconscious forces which have the potential for bringing each partner to wholeness, the inne r marriage within oneself. It means integrating the other side of the personality so its ener gies can be used in constructive ways. It is the marriage of the conscious personality and the an ima or animus. This is the daily confrontation of married life, getting up and going to bed toge ther, merely being in one another's presence. It is transformative; it is a yoga or \"yoking\" o f individuals in the service of their union. Marriage itself can be a spiritual path, or app roached from a spiritual perspective. Having meaningful interaction and true intimacy requires renewed con cern for the \"now.\" The sacred marriage always takes place \"now.\" There is no emotional relianc e on a golden, honeymoon past nor escape to an idealized future when \"surely everything wi ll be better.\" The sacred marriage is an arena for individuation of the partners through th e mutual give- and-take of everyday life. The sacred marriage is no final act but requires periodic renewal. This cyclic renewal is intrinsic to the Hera cult. She was symb olically purified and renewed her commitment to Zeus in recurrent wedding ceremonie s. So when we choose in life to renew our marriage vows on an anniversary, we follow Hera's lead. These multiple weddings indicate a return to the condition of uncon scious, original identity. At the time of the wedding, Zeus and Hera are truly one through the process of identification or participation mystique. But, inevitably, another crisis situation creates a critical atmosphere, but it is a necessary prelude to conscious realizati ons. And the cycle goes on... In her article \"Sexuality and Marriage: Divine Marriage or Divine Alchemy,\" We ndy Doniger (the Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions at the Divin ity), points out that sexual issues have always been at the heart of religion, with its concern f or procreation, origins, birth, the survival of the human race.

She makes many good points about t heir assumption of dominion in this area of human life. Why should a priest legislate sexuality? There are two sides to this question : Why should a priest want to interfere in this area, and why should people allow him t o do so? The answer to the first side is that sexuality is among the most basic of human needs, th e key to the survival of human life. To control sexuality means to control everything that ste ms from it — politics, power, everything. Moreover, that very same fact — that this force i s so deeply imbedded in the human organism — suggests the answer to the second side of t he question. For sexuality, like death, is an area of great vulnerability, mystery, danger; it is, ul timately, inaccessible to reason or to science. This is the shadowy place in whic h people feel a need for religion, where priests are invited to enter in or offer to enter in. The sexual connection between god(s) and humans is often envisioned as a kin d of marriage — the hieros gamos of the ancient world, the nun’s wedding to Jesu s — or as sexuality — the gloss on the Song of Songs, Bernini’s Saint Theresa, and so forth. B ut it is also envisioned as divorce or adultery. God’s abandonment of his worshippe r and human adultery often become metaphors for one another. Stories about human women and men become inextricably entangled in the t oils of human sexual tragedy and take flight in the illusion provided by myth. But the banal and the magical are by no means mutually exclusive, for the royal road that connects myt h and experience is a two-way stretch. The myth is a bridge between the actual h uman sexual experience and the fantasy that grows out of that experience and in turn trans figures it. The meanings of these myths must be sought not merely in the superfic ial anthropomorphic forms and quasi-human events but in darker theological qu estions. Irrationalization occurs in mythology when ideas about men and women are transfor med into myths about gods and goddesses, but the opposite process, rationalization, is equally common and important, when ideas about gods and goddesses are translated into myt hs about men and women. Gender plays a central role in the wider religious concern with order. Br oadly speaking, a structuralist might say that, in religious thinking, gender/sexuality = c ulture/nature. Religious communities and dogmas tend to disqualify the pieces that don’ t fit their paradigm; if the paradigm is defined as male (as it usually is), they discard or devalue the female (or the homosexual, or the bisexual). Thus, women (and, sometimes, eu nuchs or bisexuals) are usually cast as the villains in the founding myths dealing wi th such central religious topics as death, evil, and disease. Traditional religions regard sexuality as, overwhelmingly, heterosexuality. What homosexual themes there are in traditional myths are seldom overt, because such myths almost always have, as a latent agenda, the biological and spiritual survival of a particul ar race, in both senses of the word: race as contest and as species (\"us against them\"), the \"outnumber-them\" agenda (\"be fruitful and multiply\"). Such myths regard homosexual acts as potentially subversive of this agenda (or, at the very least, irrelevant to i t, perhaps not part of the problem, but certainly not part of the solution)."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"The ascetic aspects of Hinduism and Christianity, among other religions, cr eate a violent dichotomy between heterosexual marriage, in which sexuality is tolerated for the sake of children, and the renunciant priesthood, in which asceticism is id ealized and sexuality entirely rejected, or at least recycled. In this taxonomy, homosexual love repr esents what Mary Douglas has taught us to recognize as a major category error, something that does n’t fit into any existing conceptual cubbyhole, \"matter out of place\" (in a word, dir t). (Here we may do well to recall the ways in which homophobic language often employs \"dir t\" symbolism.) Traditional religious texts regard homosexual union not, like het erosexual marriage, as a compromise between two goals in tension (procreation and asce ticism), but as a mutually polluting combination of the worst of both worlds (sterili ty and lust). The myths therefore seldom explicitly depict homosexual unions at all, let al one sympathetically. Other mythologies of sex and gender are not necessarily open to more liberal c onstructions of gender than our own; some of them are simply open to different construct ions from ours. Yet the very fact that they explore options that we have not even considere d gives them the power to make us notice the ways in which our own religious trad itions legislate, often without our conscious knowledge, our sexuality. Occupations associated with Hera include: boardmember chairperson faithful spouse \"first mate\" first lady heir hostess housewife investor landlady matron mother monarch patroness philanthropist queen \"rich bitch\" visionary widow wife EMOTIONAL IMAGE Most of her stories are connected with her relationship with Zeus . Some evidence in texts that a more equal power relationship than that presented in Homer. Her a's main spheres of influence are marriage, weddings and childbirth. The divine marr iage, hieros gamos, is critical to her cult (cf., Iliad XIV.152-353). Hera shares with Gaia certain powe rs and conflict with the male. Version that Hera created Typhon; Birth of He phaistos; Attempted overthrow of Zeus by Hera, Poseidon and Athena. Inherent dichotomy and contrad iction in Hera (inversion of the good wife) seen in her: Marriage; Relationship w ith her children; Story of Ixion reflects her ties to the patriarchy. The emotional dynamics of Hera revolve around being perfected or thwarted in her mission. When she is thwarted she is essentially animus-possessed an d rages against her \"persecutors.\" She becomes over identified with her own masculine aggr essive side, and paradoxically rejects her own feminine identity. She may be the victim of a negative mother complex, and be too one-sided."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Hera's jealousy is extreme enough to be called pathological. She doesn't have jeal ousy as an emotion. Hera is this archetypal form of jealousy of the spouse's attention. To f eel this feeling is a form of merging with the goddess -- an epiphany. But it may feel more like being possessed by a demon or the \"green-eyed monster.\" On the positive side, Hera embodies the feminine portion of the transpe rsonal authority, the Self. Inner contact with this archetype for a woman is an experience of the core of her being. To be in harmony with herself, she must serve this inner dynamism . We can view this modern worship of Hera by giving her our attention. A neurotic or under-developed man would have to come to terms with the aut horitarian aspect of the mother-complex. A man involved in developing his \"femi nine\" side would serve Hera over and against the logos principle, listening to his heart as we ll as his head. This is generally a stage in the psychic life of men whose quest for the Sel f culminates in the PUER/SENEX reunion, which expresses itself through \"masculine\" s ymbolism (see Chapter XXI). The man in touch with the deep values of spousal intim acy is her 'hero.' The fulfillment and wholeness of Zeus and Hera consists of a dyadic relat ionship. \"Being a couple\" is her big deal! They are two-in-one, contained by their relations hip, unless possessiveness flares up. If they become estranged emotionally, she may rep ress the direct expression of her sexuality, projecting onto Zeus the fulfillment of her repressed desires. He manifests it through an affair. Psychologically, the \"other woman,\" so despise d, represents unknown aspects of her own being. Hera wants to be in the presence of her beloved, because she derives her f ulfillment through involvement. She always expects a deeper commitment from her sp ouse than she will ever get, however. The intense involvement is not always pleasant. Zeus and Hera are the types who figure that \"negative attention is better than no attention\" in their exchanges. Hera is first and foremost the dutiful wife of Zeus. We might call her t he wife of the CEO of Mt. Olympus. She is as potent of a directing force as he is. But in a patriarch al society her powers tend to appear in negative forms. Managerial ability can become an exaggerated urge to control or have power over those closest at hand -- the family, wh o tend to resent it. Zeus is notoriously promiscuous, and Hera directs a great deal of animosity at Ze us and his mortal and immortal paramours. Hera can be both jealous (internal) and vind ictive (extroverted). She must have been kept pretty busy by Zeus' philande ring. She must have been in a perpetual tizzy, because the number of his liaisons is legen dary. But Zeus had no immunity against the onslaughts of Hera! The masculine principle, as r epresented by Zeus, is far from omnipotent when challenged by her powerful contrary princip le. Hera is repeatedly the victim of her own powerful emotions. The volcanic qu ality of her animus (inner masculinity) is embodied in Hephaistos, her lame son. Th is issue of parthenogenesis was conceived without a father, from her jealous brooding. A s such, he came to rule volcanic activity, both physical and emotional. When moody, Hera is c apable of veritable explosions of strong emotions."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Hera is outspoken and she has a judgmental, scolding tongue. But she is not always overt in her attacks. Despite her moral indignation at the behavior of others, she is m ore than willing to manipulate the feelings of others to suit her own needs and de sires.

She has an aristocratic aura which assumes a right to c ommand, both activities and attention. She is born-to-order and scarcely questions thi s destiny as anything other than her rightful position in life. She may express herself thr ough becoming a patron of the arts, or an administrator, (for example, a Dean of Women, or Board Member). As the result of her strong social concerns, she pays special attention to k eeping herself attractive. She is always fashionable and publicly appropriate. She has a stron g sense of honor and duty. Many find these qualities present in former First Lady, Nan cy Reagan. Before her, the personality of Jackie Kennedy fascinated the world. Hera prefers to grapple with concrete details, rather than muse on int ellectual theories or abstractions. This can be valuable in coordinating an estate where there is al ways much to be done.

Q: Silly as this may seem, I have this internal str uggle going on between my own \"whom does the grail serve\" between Aphrodite and Hera. I have been \"cla imed\" by Aphrodite early and could not imagine a life without her beauty, strength, passion, dignity and sensuality that she has graced me with being a woman...But, I feel this other great pull of wantin g to attract a life-mate. Certainly not Zeus with a ll his philandering, but, I know Aphrodite wasn't thrilled exactly her \"partner\" or the whole \"till death do us part ritual\" either and dallied around, quite nicel y, thank you! And Hera was the one to call for the sacred marriage and also the queen of the Gods. So, how do I get the best of both worlds here? I want the two together and yet they seem so opposed. Plea se help me out here. - DIVINELY DEVOTED Dear \"Divinely Devoted,\" Your question does not seem silly at all. It's an i mportant one. You have articulated something that l ots of women feel, especially since we have \"cultural r einforcement\" (through media images, movies, etc.) that we should use Aphrodite's talents only as a me ans to lead to Hera's hieros gamos (sacred marriage), but not use the Goddess of Love's gifts after the altar. Aspects of both archetypes resonat e with most women: how do we live with the tension be tween \"loyal mate,\" keeper of the fidelity flame, and \"sensual lover,\" the generative, female sexual spark--which may not be so easy to limit to just on e partner? I think the answer to your question \"Whom does the grail serve?\" is: both of them, if you wan t a long-term relationship. Their realms are not as \" opposed\" as they might seem on first glance. And Aphrodite's stories highlight important points abou t how to keep a life-mate, whether male or female, interested for the long haul. APHRODITE AND THE SACRED MARRIAGE OF ZEUS AND HERA In Book Five of Homer's Iliad, Zeus alludes to the realm of \"marriage\" as Aphrodite's sphere of expertise. He says to her: \"Not to you, my child, have been given the works of war; you, rather, should attend to the charming works of marriage.\" (lines 428-30) It was Aphrodite who helped to save Hera and Zeus's marriage, by loaning Hera her Magic Girdle.

Hera and Aphrodite's purpose is u nited in this story: to save the sacred cosmic marriage. This myth implies that Aphrodite is neces sary to a marriage; Aphrodite's gifts helped Hera keep her marriage to the King of the Cosmos alive. Charming one's partner, even after years of marriage, is vital, according to this myth. Aphrodi te and Hera went head-to-head on more political issues such as the beauty contest judged by Paris t hat became the beginning of the Trojan War (Grimal 192). But in terms of preserving the \"hieros gamos, \" the goddesses were in accord. APHRODITE'S MARRIAGE But what of Aphrodite's own marriage? As you astute ly point out, Dear Reader, she cheated on her lame husband Hephaestus by having a number of love affairs, the most famous ones with: Ares, the God of War; Hermes, the Trickster God of Communicat ion and Commerce; Adonis, the younger hunk; and Anchises, the hottie in the hills. I think the message here is that as the Goddess of Love, she ha d to spread love around--to reach difficult arenas like war, via the realms of communication and business, the young and the old, with immortals and mortals a like. Although she was not faithful, her marriage was a source of power for Aphrodite. After all, she was married to a son of Zeus, and her husband loved her. Truly, madly, deeply. Hephaestus was jealous of Ares. According to Homer' s Odyssey [Book Eight], when Hephaestus contrived to catch Aphrodite cheating with Ares, he built a magic net which was hung as a trap over the Love Goddess's bed. Although Hephaestus was lam e, a wound he received when either his mother or father threw him from Olympus (both versions of his lameness are in the Iliad), the smithy was ingenious and creative. His web caught the lovers i n flagrante delicto; the gods in Olympus came to see the cheaters on display, all but Poseidon laugh ing at them (Friedrich 63). Some mythographers have interpreted this \"lovers trap\" scene as a symbol of shame brought on her husband by Aphrodite; in othe r words, that the expression of female sexuality beyo nd the boundaries of marriage will bring public embarrassment--ridicule due to cuckolding. Aphrodite expert Paul Friedrich, however, sees the \"lovers trap\" scene as possibly illustrating Aphrodite's complete freedom from shame, in that sh e is allowed to go on her merry way afterwards with no change in status: a sign of her own high st ature in Olympus and the power of love. In The Meaning of Aphrodite, Friedrich comments, too, that Book Eight of the Odyssey \"raises serious questions about the symbolism of the relations betw een Aphrodite and Hephaestus\" (64). Friedrich sees some significant positive elements in the A-H union . Friedrich asserts that far from lame, Hephaestus is one virile guy with a lot to offer a sexy gal: \"his bellows as testicles, his hammer as a phallus, the gold he works as semen, and the fire of his great forge as the lust of sex\" (65). This is not a guy who needed any sexual coaching; he sired lots of childr en, and not only with his wife. Aphrodite is an ear th goddess who ascends to the sky; Hephaestus is a sky god who is cast below. Together, they move heaven and earth. She loves gold; he makes gold jew elry. Also, Aphrodite is dominant in their relationship, which doesn't sound like a bad deal. So Aphrodite's own marriage has strengths that are often overlooked."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"LEARNING FROM THEIR STORIES.

Easy divorce has not been an option, historically speakin g. It is basically a new phenomenon. We are so casual in modern society that relationship s are considered \"disposable\" or re-cyclable through serial relationship s. With a 50% divorce rate for baby-boomers, and a 70% divorce rate for Gen-X, we have quickie \"no-fault \" do- it-yourself divorce. Since the state of mind of the spouses is not identical coming into th e marriage, there are usually differences in the adjustment to marriage. Differences in tempo, maturity, and in the degree of spiritual development are typically causes of difficulty, acc ording to Jung. One partner is generally more psychologically complex than the other. This partner is frequently capable of much faster spiritual growth, but may be erratic. The spouse who is grounded in a positive relationship to the parents can ge nerally adapt better. They are not hindered by a deep-seated unconscious tie to the p arents as divine,"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"god-like beings. They have successfully emancipated and therefore are mor e mature. They come into marriage as adults rather than \"adult children.\" A complex nature has many facets, and this personality may seek to realize many of them as symbolized by the impulsive promiscuity of Zeus. Versatility and spontan eity may have a certain charm, but it can mask an underlying impulsiveness. Jung thought that a woman's spiritual life was contained in her relation ship to her husband. Conversely, a man is contained emotionally in his wife, according to h is notion. This may have been an accurate observation in his day of more traditional gender m odels. However, the alternative lifestyle movement has produced many spiritu ally-oriented persons with commitments outside the Dyad. For example, a woman devotee of a spi ritual Master obviously is not wholly contained spiritually by her husband. He does not contain her entire spiritual animus projection. She sees it in all her relati ons with significant others. Likewise, a man involved in intensive social action such as counseling, has a vigorou s emotional life outside the home. These divided loyalties are actually healthier than the all-or-nothing pr oposition of having no essential obligations or binding interests outside of the marriage. Ne vertheless, the simpler spouse has the advantage of undividedness. The other spouse may en vy this condition, feeling outside the marriage. This can become problematical, s ince it awakens longing for that particular bliss. Maybe the spouse begins to fantasize it can be found in another lover. Hera has rad ar for such impulses, and her insecurities are painfully aroused. The spect er of rivals begins to appear on the horizon. Driven inward by disappointment, the spouse may beco me desperate or violent, exploding in a spasm of rage and manipulative tactics. For ced to turn inward, the individual may be lucky enough to find an inner self-suffici ency which was latent potential all along. As the possibilities of inner integration become more apparent to b oth spouses, they have the possibility of achieving the experience of an undivided self. Thi s is a quantum leap in consciousness which is equivalent to a metamorphosis. This stage cannot come without confrontation of the anima/animus. The constant animosity depicted in the Z eus-Hera configuration has a telos or goal. Every phase of life has its particular psychological goals as well as physical change s. One can always hope to be surprised in marriage by having one's own complexities ans wered by a corresponding diversity. But progress may also be arrested at any stage of development with no further breakthroughs. Things get stuck; there is a \"stale-mate.\" Consider the divorce rate. Individual capacities for adjustment vary. Remember, Hera remarries Ze us over and over again. You might think they are trying to get it right. Is the third time the c harm? There is pathology associated with this archetype including tragedy, yearnin g, jealousy, vindictiveness, and shrewishness. In the extreme, it may lead to homici de. Hera is shrewd."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"This behavior, though inherent in her nature, is motivated by the attitud e and behavior of her roaming spouse, Zeus. It is purely reactionary, based on her compulsive, overwhelming need. He neve r seems to settle down, content with the domestic routines. When he persecute s her, through neglect or his affairs, she is distraught. She reacts so strongly that she even become s self-defeating and self-destructive. In her negative phase, Hera is possessed by her anim us reactions. In myth she gave reactionary birth to many monster children, conceived by he rself in the lonely brooding of rejection. She projected this rejection by Zeus into the form of her own son, Hephai stos. He is born of the primal Virgin-Mother. His birth as a separate entity means she lost t he possibility of developing her own deeply introverted creative processes. If she could onl y have gotten a meaningful job. She winds up rejecting her son as Zeus rejected her, passing on her rejection and abandonment issues inter-generationally. With Prometheus, another son, she gave birth to her rebellious opposition to t he dominion of Zeus, meaning she expelled her ability to gain in ego-consciousness. Prom etheus later has his own rebellious acts and conflicts with Zeus, carrying on the fam ily tradition. The combative Ares was the embodiment of her bloodthirsty rage, her egotism , and her jealousy. Ares' warlike nature is an instinct which has wreaked havoc on man kind. Finally, Hera goes really psychotic and expels the monster Typhon. As this reptilian G odzilla-like beast, she goes through a radical regression to the most primitive level, burs ts all fetters and runs amok. With no limit to her destructive capabilities who knows wh at damage she might do. At this point, the only hope is mitigation or litigation. Perhaps it is time f or another purification and transformation through a renewal of the sacred aspect of marriage. In the Argive legends, Hera was known as \"goddess of the yoke\" and the meaning of yoga is \"yoking\" or \"union.\" In this sense, marriage is a yoga, an arena for spiritual develop ment. On the positive side, Hera was also Mother of the Charities (Faith, Hope, and Love ), gaining thereby her affinity for charitable work. Those identified too strongly with their persona as wife need to tap the de ep resources of the animus. No one can be reduced to their role, such as merely wife, mothe r, breadwinner, etc. If a Hera-type has married a philander or liar they will become frus trated and embittered. Even so, guilt or duty or other feelings may prevent them leaving a b ad marriage. She represses her natural response. She may sublimate her rage in manu al or mental work, rather than allowing herself to truly feel the energy and transmute it. If abandoned, she may have trouble believing that the loss is permanent. She believes in the fantasy of his return and eventual reconciliation. This denial prevents grieving and b locks her process of recovery. The alchemical notion of \"the chymical wedding\" returns marriage to i ts spiritual side as a participating factor in personal transformation.

Both the texts and the iconography of the"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"alchemical tradition of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are filled with allusions to ‘the chymical marriage,’ and some of the most beautiful and compelli ng images in the texts depict the conjunction of opposites as a royal marriage. These description s and images occur with sufficient frequency to warrant comparison with the hie rosgamos (sacred marriage), as understood in the discipline of history of religions. We encou nter the idea of the hierosgamos even before we embark on a hermeneutical discussion of th e images that the work contains in the History of Religions. The term hierosgamos is used generally to refer to the union between two d ivinities, or between a human being and a god or goddess, or between two human beings (under c ertain special conditions); more particularly, it is used to refer to the ritu alized, public sexual union between the king and a hierodule (‘sacred prostitute’) in anc ient Mesopotamia. This union was accompanied by the belief that the human partners became di vine by virtue of their participation in it. It was thought, for example, that the priestes s who took part in this ritual became the goddess Inanna in the same way as ordinary bread and wine are thought to become the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the Roman Catholic celebr ation of the Eucharist. Both ritual forms entail regeneration and transformation; in Mesopotamia, the hierosgamos was thought to insure the well-being of the king, the prosperit y of the people, and the continued fertility of the land. The belief that human beings could participate in the ontological condit ion of divinity through sexual union, through the body, is exceedingly ancient, but the hierosga mos is not merely an important element in an archaic religious tradition. It is also exc eedingly persistent And, in my view, its persistence indicates more than a me rely superficial connection between its manifestations in the ancient Near East and in t he West; it has become associated with a spectrum of symbolic meanings so rich and comp elling that they continue to reassert themselves over and over again. Although the hierosgamos d id not find its way into the official teachings of Christianity, for example, it is prese nt nonetheless in the symbolism of Mary as the Bride of Christ. The major difference between the significance of the hierosgamos in t he ancient Near East and the Christian West is that its expression in the former context was b ound up with an explicit, embodied praxis that necessitated ritual sexual union. This gi ves rise to certain hermeneutical difficulties. Scholars of religion sometimes deny or i gnore the presence of the hierosgamos idea, or pronounce its use as a conceptual category invalid. Even t hose who do recognize its presence may yield to the prevailing wisdom that enc ourages the substitution of a part for the whole, and thus interpret the hierosgam os according to an allegedly higher, spiritualized ideal, having nothing to do with the body. An alogous interpretations are offered for the hierosgamos theme in alchemical te xts. Yet, many of the alchemists appear to have undergone a complex experience involving mutual rec iprocity between the events in the laboratory and within themselves of a kind that h arkens back to, and carries forward, the imprint of a religious tradition that combined ph ysical and spiritual levels of transformation. A core of meanings associated with the hierosgamos that have persisted cros s-culturally. If anything, the symbolism became enriched by the addition of Christian d octrines, especially that of the Incarnation, which signified the union of human and divine. Many al chemical texts like the Rosarium insist on the interrelatedness of body and sp irit. In seeking the"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"‘conjunction of opposites’ the alchemists were attempting to overtur n the conventional conceptual dichotomization between spirit and body, and to offer in its p lace models that reflected their intuitions of ontological wholeness. Therefore, when interpreting the hierosgamos theme in the context of the alchemical tradition we should k eep in mind the fact that it is generally meant to include the body; it signifies not only ide aliter but also realiter. An adequate hermeneutics of alchemical iconography can do just ice to the multivalence of the hierosgamos images in texts like the Rosarium only by se eking to encompass the totality of their symbolic meanings. The Rosarium Philosophorum contains twenty-one images, fifteen exhibit the hierosgamos in more or less explcit form; three others contain it implicitly. Figu re 1 shows a fountain fitted with three spigots. The waters are the key to unlocking the meani ng of this image, for the text explains that the waters flowing from each are really a single water --‘of which and with which our magistery is effected.' The three waters evoke a hierog amy described in the Enuma Elish?, a Mesopotamian creation myth from around 1900 b.c.e., which relates how the primordial waters of Tiamat, ‘she who bore them all,’ and Apsu, ‘their b egetter . . . commingle as a single body,’ and thus become the sole matrix from which eve rything emerges. The verse accompanying the figure heightens the correspondenc e between the alchemical fountain and the hierogamy that produced all life: ‘We (waters ) are the metal’s first nature and only source; the highest tincture of the Art is made through us.’ In Figure 2 we see a king and queen dressed in elaborate robes. Each holds a stal k ending in two flowers. He stands upon the sun, she on the crescent moon. Alt hough their separateness is symbolically emphasized, they clasp hands as if to prefi gure the ‘chymical marriage.’ A dove -- at once a mediating symbol as well as a further link w ith the hierosgamos, since it was associated both with Eros and with the powerfu l female divinities of the ancient Near East --is shown hovering above them, holding its own stalk which perfectly intersects the cross formed by those held by the king and q ueen. In Figure 3 the pair is naked; but, still wearing separate crowns, they proffer to one anothe r a flower on a long stalk. The banner over the king's head reads: ' O Luna, let me be thy husband '; the one over the queen's reads: ' O Sol, I must submit to thee. ' Once more, the dove appears between them, a flower in its beak. In Figure 5, we see the king and queen in sexual embrace. Figures 6-9 show the king and queen in hermaphroditic form, indicating successively deepening leve ls of conjunction, and depict them lying in a sepulcher. Their bodies are joined; they have two h eads, but now wear a single crown. Figure 11 is explicitly sexual. The king and queen, each winge d, wear two crowns, and are submerged in water. Their limbs are entwined; her han d grasps his phallus; his left hand fondles the nipple of her breast; his righ t is under her neck, supporting her. Figure 17 depicts the product of the union between th e alchemical opposites in the form of the Hermetic androgyne. This offspring is not simp ly the end result of the marriage of opposites. Figure 18 shows the lion eating the sun. It is itse lf an implicit hierogamy because it is not fully differentiated from its parents, and continues to participate in its hierogamic beginnings. Figure 19 provides an excellent example of the occasional coalescence of alch emical symbols and Christian symbols. Mary is in the center, flanked by the Fathe r and the Son who are about to crown her. The Holy Spirit--in the form of a dove--hovers above. In th e"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"background appear the words Tria and Unum. This image clearly contains a rich var iety of hierogamic themes. First, there is the symbolic similarity betwe en the three waters of the alchemical foundation we saw in Figure 1 and the Trinity. Second, the Incar nation of God the Son was made possible by a hierogamy between Mary and the third person of the Trinity. Third, the Incarnation of the Son entails an ontological condition of s imultaneous humanity and divinity--a profound manifestation of hierogamy. Like the marriage between the alchemical opposites, all these unions r equire mediation. In the alchemical marriage, this function is often performed by Mercu rius, whom Jung calls a ‘mediating symbol par excellence’; in the Rosarium , however, we have already seen the dove in the role of mediator. In this figure we see it in that role too, poised above the crown that the Father and Son are about to place on Mary's head; it is now associated wi th the third person of the Trinity. The fact that the dove was a symbolic attribute of the female divinities of the ancient near east underscores the con-clusion that Figure 19 is also a hierogamic image, albeit in Christianized form. Figure 20, the last image in the series, depicts the risen Christ. In h is left hand, he holds a banner marked with a cross; his right gestures toward the now empty sepu lchre. That sepulchre unmistakably indicates that the completed alchemical pr ocess has involved the transformation, not the transcendence, of the body. For if the alchemical wor k necessitated the transcendence of the body, one would not expect to find an empty tomb, but a t omb filled with the putrefying remains of the king and queen. Instead, we see the risen Christ, the embodiment of the hierogamic union between human and divine. In the view of the alchemist who wrote the Rosarium Philosophorum , the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body signified, not the suppression, or even the tran scendence, of the physical body, but its glorification and perfection. It is not surprising that the author of the Rosarium Philosophorum chose images of the hierosgamos to help convey something of the exquisitely subtle reciprocit y invoked in the alchemical coniunctio. The hierosgamos images of alchemy are profoundly eloque nt expressions of the experience of the true adepts as they moved through th e later stages of the work. For those alchemists, all the elements of ordinary experience w ere sacralized. The Philosopher’s Stone could be found everywhere; it was ‘walked on, ch ildren play with it’; it is familiar to all (people) both young and old, is found in the country, i n the village, in the town. Perhaps we are still capable of learning from the alchemists that what tr ansforms common substance, that which is familiar to all, is no more – and no less – than a deepe r apprehension of the significance of the Hermetic motto: ‘What is above is just as what is below.’ This motto, so often quoted and equally often misunderstood, requi res that we understand the radical implications of a ‘whole from which nothing is excluded.’ (Voss http://www.trinity.edu/mgarriso/Myth/MythSyllabus.html#top ).

She gets married in church or the Temple, not in Reno or by the Justice of the P eace. It is consecration, dedication, and consummation -- a eucharistic act. The main s piritual content of Hera revolves around the hieros gamos, or sacred marriage. On a personal level thi s means the reuniting of spirit, soul, and body. It indicates a full knowled ge of both the heights (Zeus) and depths (Hera) of one's character. When the hieros gamos is consummated in our daily lives, it means that we have learned to apply our insight s in practice. When Jung speaks about the royal marriage, he tells us that the queen symboliz es the body, the king stands for the spirit, and the soul unites the two. There fore, our psyche is a half bodily and half spiritual substance. When king and queen (animus /anima) are united, they form a magical hermaphroditic being which is a union of opposite ener gies. We need to be related to another individual, according to Jung, to experience the full de pth of our own psyche. From an internal perspective, spiritual marriage is an inner experien ce which is not projected onto another living individual. In the royal marriage of the soul with the Self, the projections of anima and animus have been returned to their proper level in the unconscious. We do not make our mate carry an essentially religious function for us anymore. The King and Queen are united, or conjoined, synthesizing the opposit es. But this cannot happen until one masters the problem of unconscious desirou sness. When the opposites to be united are the masculine consciousness (of our day worl d) and the feminine unconscious (the night world), this royal marriage is a transcendent symb ol of the Self, and embodies the psychic totality of personal wholeness. These statements need not be confused with erroneous notions concer ning the so-called \"soul-mate.\" Each individual has a complete soul, and is a divine spark. But when we choose to cast our lot with a life-mate there is a synergetic effect which transcends the qualities of the individuals involved, bringing a portion of the divine int o manifestation. It is not that a long-lost mate is rediscovered after separation on a higher plane. R ather, that"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"two compatible souls commit themselves to furthering the development of loving compassion in one another. From the archetypal perspective, the whole obje ct of marriage is to reach God. Thus marriage is seen as a creative process of love where two sou ls care for one another in a reciprocal manner, furthering mutual spiritual aims. Therefore, the Royal Marriage of Zeus and Hera means self-actualization with in the boundaries provided by the institution of marriage. Our partners are no longe r required to live our own unlived potential. Through withdrawl of projection onto th e partner, we actualize our own potential. Thus we find meaning in \"the battle of the s exes.\" We discover our own madness, as well as our own unique spirit. This creates an increase d sense of interiority which might be viewed as a thalamus or bridal chamber, a place wh ere opposites merge. According to Joseph Campbell, \" Myth helps you to put your mind in touch with this experience of being alive. It tells you what the experience is. Marriage, for exam ple. What is marriage? The myth tells you what it is. It's the reunion of the separated duad. O riginally you were one. You are now two in the world, but the recognition of the spiritual identi ty is what marriage is. . . . When people get married because they think it's a long-time love af fair, they'll be divorced very soon, because all love affairs end in disappointment. But marriage i s recognition of a spiritual identity. . . . By marrying the right person, we recon struct the image of the incarnate God, and that's what marriage is. The internal union of hieros gamos helps ensure the external reunion in a primary relationship. By discovering split s within myself and healing them, I prepare for a spiritual identity. Otherwise my partner end s up carrying the burden of Eve, Helena, Mary or Sophia to compensate for my unresolved anima issues . \" How does one choose the right person? Your heart tells you. It ought to. Your inn er being. That's the mystery. You recognize your other self? Well, I don't know, but there's a flash that comes, and something in you knows that this is the one. The Intuitive Sel f knows when the spiritual partner arrives. By attending to the moment, I will have the pe rceptiveness to recognize the flash when it comes. If I am not listening, the flash wil l come and go without my noticing it. Why is it that marriage is so precarious in our modern society? Be cause it's not regarded as a marriage. I would say that if the marriage isn't a first priority in y our life, you're not married. The marriage means the two that are one, the two become one flesh. If the marriage lasts long enough, and if you are acquiescing constantly to it instead of to i ndividual personal whim, you come to realize that that is true - the two really are one. Pr imarily spiritually. The biological is the distraction which may lead you to the wrong i dentification. According to Campbell, the necessary function of marriage, perpetuating ou rselves in children, is not the primary one; that's really just the elementary aspe ct of marriage. There are two completely different stages of marriage. First is the youthful marriage following the wonderful impulsethat nature has given us in the interplay of the sexes b iologically in order to produce children. But there comes a time when thechild graduate s from the family and the couple is left. Marriage is a relationship. When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you're sac rificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship.

And that's a purely mythological image signifying the sacrific e of the visible entity for a transcendent good. This is something that becomes be autifully realized in the second stage of marriage, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two exper iencing that they are one. . . It's primarily a spiritual exercise, and the society is supposed to help u s have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in t he service of man. We presume we make a commitment for better or for worse. That's the r emnant of a ritual. And the ritual has lost its force. The ritual that once conveyed an inn er reality is now merely form. And that's true in the rituals of society and in the pers onal rituals of marriage and religion. (Campbell).

There are discussions around issues such as Sacred Marriage: Re lationship as Immortality. All our cultural experience and individual conscious existe nce depends on the fabric of life, the germ line, and this comes not from male dominion, but f rom the mutual sexual relationship between the two genders. In this relationship, the female stands central as the sole bearer of cytoplasmic inheritance and the principal investor i n time and resources. However the male likewise contributes genetically in ful l and pivotal share. Immortality is thus not the domain of one gender but of the relationship bet ween woman and man. Cultures which fail to respect these socio-biological realiti es lead to gender oppression, especially the repression of women. Attunement with the immortal continuity of life likewise comes fr om the relationship between woman and man, not from one gender alone. Each sex is sterile on its own and mortal as individuals. The family relationship is an embodiment of this on going immortal web of life. Relationship is conceived spiritually in the form of 'holy mat rimony', the harmony that is produced from the creative relationship between woman and man. It is thus the sacred marriage in which we find God and Gaia, the Feminine fac e of deity, in divine union. The healing of the epoch of male dominion requires mankind to atone for the e rrors of his ways and come to terms of learning, healing and new wisdom, but true liberati on arises from reconciliation, not dominion in any form, male or female. The embodimen t of reconciliation is forgiveness and the celebration of it is the sacred marr iage. This marriage is by definition one in true freedom for each gender. That is its very sacre dness - its complete freedom, combined with the devoted commitment to one ano ther the marriage expresses. This is a paradox of trust. It does not imply any form of possession. Solom on did not possess the Queen neither she him. The Bridegroom archetype is in a sense the heroic journey of every shaman on t he vision quest, every budding troubadour, and every knight of courtly love, from Dumuzi through Adonis to Lancelot."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Inanna sang: \"Make your milk sweet and thick, my br idegroom. My shepherd, I will drink your fresh milk. Wild bull, Dumuzi, make your milk sweet and thick. I will drink your fresh milk.... The Jewish messiah is also a fully-human figure, traditionally a heroic pri est or king who performs genuine social redemption of his people - inspiring long-te rm future goodness. David, Solomon and Cyrus represent different forms of 'anointed' or messi ah, with Solomon figuring very strongly as the Bridegroom in his renowned sacred marri age with the Queen of Sheba, which is the subject of the Song of Songs, perhaps t he most fertile passage ever written in both the mountains of sexual spice and the image of th e beloved as the progenitor of fertility: \"Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up fr om the washing, whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren one among them\" I rose up to open to my beloved and my hands droppe d with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdraw n himself and was gone: my soul failed when he spake : I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer Later Jesus adopted the Bridegroom archetype in the prophecy of Isaiah 61 in pronouncing his manifestation at the Nazareth synagogue, for which he was nearly thrown of f a cliff. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sewn in it to spring forth so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. This set the tradition on to a new extreme Zoroastrian form of cosmic renovat or, Jesus promising the Kingdom as the messiah ofhistory redeeming the Earth fro m the sins of woman, stemming from Eve and the Fall - the son of man, the archetype of Adam: And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. This mission culminated in the Crucifixion, and the exaltation of Magdalen on the third day in the very tradition of Inanna repeating the very words of the Song of Songs call ing for the lost Adonis: 'Woman, why weepest thou?' She saith unto them, 'Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him' ... Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

However the fertility Bridegroom is a very different 'kettle of fish' f rom the ichthys of Christianity. Where Jesus was the bridegroom of the church on the marri age bed of the Cross, the fertility Bridegroom is the bridegroom of the immortal femi nine face, embodied in Gaia - the living earth. The fertility Bridegroom starts out by breaking all t he curses ever made against women: I unpronounce original sin. I unpronounce dominion over nature. I unpronounce the Anathema maranatha. I unpronounce the death curse on the witch. I unpronounce stoning for adultery or any other violent punishment. I apologise to all women for the sins of man. and promises to stand beside women and men of like spirit to safeguard the f uture of life: I vouchsafe to the immortal Feminine the troth of s acred marriage. I promise to stand by the Bride whatever the cost to culminate the patriarchal epoch for the future o f life on earth."},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"This is literally turning the tables on the whole paradigm, giving not only wom en but men of like spirit, liberation from the binds of orthodoxy and the heritage of Arm ageddon. Women as a gender alone struggle to achieve an equality which will only be achie ved slowly world-wide because of ingrained patriarchal supremacy in diverse cultu res spanning all the continents. By the time eventual social change restores the freedom of women world-wide, nature will have been so damaged that our heritage of biodiversity will not be wi th us for the future of humanity and the unfolding of life. By forming a relationship now in which female and male meet in reconciliation, a broad consensus for feminine sustainability can be achieved in a way which would be impossible otherwise. It is possib le to combine vehement and oceanic support for women's liberation and empowerment wor ldwide with constructive gender engagement. Although the fertility principle and the sacred marriage rite extol s sexual union, life, birth and spring as symbols of life burgeoning forth, rather than the cult of deat h, fertility in this sense does not imply rampant sexual reproduction, but furthering the on going continuity of life into the unfolding future - what furthers the sustainable dive rsity of life. Fertility thus comes with natural moderation of population. A key to this is women having fr eedom of reproductive choice. The key role of the fertility Bridegroom is to act as a h ealing catalyst, in cooperation with women and men of like spirit, to save the world's livin g heritage for the unfolding future, by liberating the paradigm into the epoch of the Tree. T he key to the whole existential dilemma we face is saving as much of the diversity of life as possible now, so that those that follow us will have their rightful share of the diversity of life instead of a veritable genetic desert of our own making, caused by the selfishness an d greed of what is almost a single generation. King's group invites all women to join with with men of like spirit in f orming a feminine Wisdom democracy to conceive apocalypsia the bridal unveiling and to fulfill th e unfolding of the epoch of the Tree of Life, the liberation from prison of those that are bound and the Sakina of the dove of peace.

This is to end the tradition of the 'lord messiah' in being the humble follower of democracia - collective wisdom through peer review. This division of sexuality and spirituality is rather recent in the hi story of religious experience. In most pagan societies, sexuality is seen as an important aspe ct of uniting the spiritual with the physical and with the worship of gods and goddesses. I n many ancient cities, sacred prostitutes \"served\" at the temples in order to be the mediatrix between the gods and humans. One writer notes, Now certainly I am not suggesting that true sexuality and spirituality shoul d be untied in this way. After all, this was what the Apostle Paul was trying to straighten out in the C orinthian church because some of the believers were apparently still having intercourse with s acred prostitutes (I Cor."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"6:15-20). In order to correct this perversion, he encourages the cultivation of a sexual relationship in marriage as a prevention from this abundant \"sacred sex.\" Apparently, even the ma rried couples had become abstinent as an overreaction to the Corinthian extremes and had thrown the sexual relationship totally out of marriage. To this problem, Paul tells them to \"stop deprivi ng themselves,\" and to recultivate the sexual area of their marriage lest they be severely te mpted by the culture (or Satan). In similar fashion the Church has been reacting and overreacting on the re lation of sexuality to spirituality ever since."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS Juno (Roman) Lakshmi (Hindu) Parvati (Hindu) CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE In addition to now-passed Princess Diana, there are other famous Hera wome n whose husbands are wealthy and powerful enough to challenge the limits of t heir marriage.

Increasing the political rights of women and ensuring equal pay for equal work, this Equal Rights Amen dment has not been able to prevail over the socially dominant patriarchy. It is interesting that Hera was known in the past as Era. Thus, she is th e underlying archetypal dominant of the ERA. All those wives and mothers proclaiming thei r equality in the paternal society are devotees of Hera. Working women who have experienced severe discrimination in the job market are now \"venting their spleens.\" DIALOGUE WITH HERA Through dialoguing with Hera, we can learn about our unconscious attitudes tow ard marriage or bonding with a spouse. She can show us how we subconscious ly are feeling toward our spouse or the institution of marriage at any given time. In active imagination she may appear as jealous, bitchy, vindictive, frustrated or argumentative, depending on how the primary relationship is going. At least, w hen you agree to dialogue with her, she gets Her voice, at last. She might appear as the ele gant bride, or celestial queen. If you have lost a loved one for whom you still grieve, she may appear as Hera Chera, who has lost her mate. She can also inform us about our individuation process when she is seen as th e Soul-as- Queen and her husband Zeus-the-King is Spirit. Watch your dreams for im ages of weddings and nuptial festivities. It is better for you to be a participati ng onlooker at these events, rather than the bride or groom. Imagining oneself as the King or Queen without the proper protection from archetypal identification is probably grandiose fantasy, rather than true transformat ive process work. This would mean your ego or personality is too strongly identified with th ese powerful archetypes, and this means being in a state of possession or compulsive domin ance of your life by the archetype. As an observer you can appreciate the Royal Marriage takin g place in your psyche with better results in daily life. If you are dating, and are really looking for a potential spouse, or if you are engaged and fantasize continually about your impending marriage, you can bet Hera is at work i n you."},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"For Hera, the accent is on the marriage itself, where a goddess such as Dem eter primarily seeks a father for her children. If you are single and considering marriage, ask Hera in dialogue just what type ofsp ouse will fulfill her requirements for a multidimensional relationsh ip.

Ask Hera about her feelings concerning all the aspects of your relationshi p which include physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual bonding. If your physical rel ationship is off you might want her to summon help from Aphrodite; if your spouse won't talk t o you about meaningful issues of the day, perhaps Athena could help. Gods and goddesses do not exist in vacuums or isolation. Once you are familiar wit h the basic cast of players, you inner dramas can have dynamic interaction of several arch etypes. They can dialogue with one another, as well as you. But, be careful--don't amas s too much power in one place at once or you will be overwhelmed and unable to integrate t he results of the exercise.

Despite current circumstances, at this point in your life, which d o you prefer most -- to be married or single? If you are single, do you find yourself continually \"siz ing up\" eligible members of the opposite sex as potential mates? 2. When you date(d) do you see several others simultaneously (Aphrodite or Don Ju an) or do you tend to focus on one lover at a time (serial monogamy)? 3. If you are married now, how do you feel consciously about your relationship on the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual levels? Be honest with you rself. Are you still as compatible as when you wed? Are your growth rates similar or is one partner overly dependent or immature? 4. In what ways does your commitment to relationship limit your sense of pers onal freedom (Zeus); how does it expand your potentials? 5. In Hera's cult, her marriage was periodically renewed. Can you do this with in the context of one primary relationship for a lifetime, or have you been remarrie d instead? Name 3 ways to keep the freshness of your marriage alive. 6. What makes the Hera-in-you jealous, vindictive, or explosive? Do you repress her s harp tongue, or vent your wrath? If so how do you deal with those feelings or resolve th e situation?"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"7. Divorce is also part of the Hera syndrome -- a sort of metaphorical ritual pur ification when an outworn relationship has turned poisonous.

Each soul has th e potential for wholeness within itself. So partners may be well-suit ed but not necessarily \"fated\" for one another. This sense of destiny comes from projecting our soul onto another, which sometimes results in unrequited love. 9. Are other gods intruding on your human marriage so that Hera feels shortchanged in time or depth of relationship? For example, Aphrodite trying to steal one' s spouse, or Athena making one's spouse workaholic.

Have you ever had to deal with an adulterous spouse? How did you feel and react? Did it destroy your relationship, ultimately? How did you deal with rejection? 11. Can you remember any dreams of weddings from any period of your life? If so, what elements within yourself do you think were uniting? Consider the oute r circumstances at the time. You may dream of a positive experience of being the wedding partn er of a sacred figure. This is an inner experience of wholeness if there is a mysteri ous and divine emotional effect on you or you feel erotic bliss and union with the partner w hen it embraces you. This is a dream of the Sacred Marriage, which may foretell its actualization in the future, or just show its potential. It is a mystical reunion, which brings peace , yet is electrifying. This is a dream of Hera the Perfected or Fulfilled One. 12. How do you feel about women's rights proposals such as the now-defunct Eq ual Rights Amendment (E.R.A.)? 13.

CHAPTER VI: THE LOVERS EROS AND PSYCHE The story of Eros and Psyche has been passed down through the work of a Greek i nitiate in the Eleusinian (or Isis) Mysteries. In THE GOLDEN ASS OF APULEIUS , the tale of these divine lovers is inserted into the personal story of Apuleius. It is a tale of psychosexual transformation. Eros and Psyche is a 12-part Mytheme: 1. Psyche--Wow, She's Gorgeous! 2. The Wrath of Venus 3. Eros Tumbles for Psyche 4. Eros Conceals Himself 5. Psyche Smells a Rat 6. Psyche Takes a Peek 7. Eros Abandons Psyche 8. Psyche Is Punished 9. Venus Imposes the Tasks 10. The Impossible Task"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"11. Eros Lends a Helping Hand 12. Psyche Joins the Immortals The tale has great psychological value since it reveals the development of th e initiate's relationship with his anima as a result of the initiatory process. Eros is a p hallic god -- the erotic impulse -- who pricks and stings with his arrow of love. In the tal e, Eros represents the reproductive passion which is transformed through its relationshi p with Psyche. The union of Eros with Psyche engenders bliss. Eros bonded with Psyche r epresents bonding of soul and mind. In the mytheme, Eros is cured from lust and cleaves to Psych e. Elements of this tale have come down in fairytales such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast . In The Uses of Enchantment (1975), Freudian analyst Bruno Bettelheim interprets the \"Cupid and Psyche\" myth as a story about a the development of mature consci ousness, the difficulty of joining wisdom and sexuality, and the problem of sexual anxi ety. He also sees some aspects of Oedipal love involved in this story, especially Aphrodi te’s possessive jealousy of her son, but overall, his interpretation is very optimistic about t he psychological potential of human development as it is presented in the Eros and Psyche t ale. When Psyche breaks the taboo by using the lamp to see Eros in the darkness, Be ttelheim understands this as an attempt to expand her consciousness before sh e is ready for it: The story warns that trying to reach for consciousness before one is mature enough for it or through short-cuts has far reaching consequences; consciousness cannot be gained in one fell swoop. In desiring mature consciousness, one puts one’s life on the line, as Psyche does when she tries to kill herself in desperation. The incredible hard ships Psyche has to endure suggest the difficulties we encounters when the highest psychic qualities (Psyche) are to be wedded to sexuality (Eros). Bettelheim emphasizes the dangers involved in developing consciousn ess. Psyche’s repeated decisions to kill herself in order to end her despair at the prospect of completing her seemingly impossible tasks symbolically express the depression whic h frequently accompanies psychological development. For Bettelheim, a primary aspect of this development is the integration of sexuality with the highest aspirations of consciousness. He insists that nothing less than a spiritual rebirth is required to b ring together these seemingly opposite aspects of the human being. The troubled relationship between Eros and Psyche symbolizes the di fficulty involved in this integrative process, and Psyche’s journey to the underworld dramat ically portrays the powerful experience of rebirth which preceds and helps to bring about this hard-won integration. . . .To begin with, the prediction that Psyche will be carried of f by a horrible snake gives visual expression to the inexperienced girl’s formless sexual anxieties. The funeral procession which leads Psyche to her destiny suggests the deat h of maidenhood, a loss not easily accepted. The readiness with which Psyche permits h erself to be persuaded to kill Eros, with whom she cohabits, indicates the strong negative feelin gs which a young girl may harbor against him who has robbed her of her virginity. According to Bettelheim, the value of the animal-husband tales, includi ng the Eros and Psyche story, is that they assure children that their fear of sex as somethin g beastly is not unique to them and that sexual anxiety, which is often implanted by others, fr equently"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"turns out to be unfounded. Stories about the animal-husband assure chil dren that their fear of sex as something dangerous and beastly is by no means unique to them; man y people have felt the same way. But as the story characters discovers that desp ite such anxiety their sexual partner is not an ugly creature burt a lovely person, so will t he child. On a preconscious level these tales convey to the child that much of his an xiety is implanted in him by what he hs been told; and that matters may be quite different wh en one experiences them directly, from the way one sees them from the outsid e. So when Psyche discovers that her lover is not the monster she feared but a m agnificent god, this reassures people on a subconscious level that sex is not beastly but potentially beautiful. In this reasoning Bettelheim goes a step beyond [J.] Schroeder and [Jacques] Barachilon, who more or less use the Eros and Psyche myth to illustrate the dynamics of projection as a girl’s way of dealing with her sexual anxieties. Bettelheim s tresses ore than these other two commentators the role of society in generating sexual anxiet y in children and the positive unconscious role which the Eros and Psyche myth and other animal- husband tales have in offsetting such anxiety. Erich Neumann sees Psyche as originally bound to Eros in a paradise of urobori c unconsciousness, and when she sees Eros in the light, this original u nconscious tie is dissolved. For Neumann this change represents a shift from the princi ple of fascinating attraction and the fertility of the species to a genuine love principle of personal development and encounter. For Neumann the link between individu ation and love as encounter is one of the central psychological insights of the myth: \"With Ps yche, then, there appears a new love principle, in which the encounter between f eminine and masculine is revealed as the basis of individuation\" ( Amor and Psyche , p. 90). Individuation is accomplished through a conscious encounter with the unconscious, which is symbolized by contrasexual symbols: the male achieves individuation b y confronting his unconscious, personified as a feminine anima and the female meets her u nconscious personified by male figures. This process is usually understood intrap sychically, but it is generally influenced by encounters with persons of the opposite sex in t he external world. In this view, a loving encounter is often the occasion for an intensificati on of the individuation process. From this traditional Jungian perspective Eros can be seen as either Psyche’s inner masculine side or as a figure who transcends (is outside of) her own mind—e ither as a person in the external world or as a god in a transcendent reality. In an accessi ble style and readable prose, Barbara Weir Huber explores the myth of Psyche, interweavin g research from diverse disciplines such as current feminist and educational t heories, mythology, literature, psychology, and cultural anthropology. She offers an original, criti cal reinterpretation of the myth, highlighting the way it overtly portrays fe male experience in a patriarchal context while covertly affirming all aspects of female life. In Transforming Psyche Huber shows that the myth of Psyche and Eros can be interpreted to illuminate the experiences of twentieth-century women. In contras t to the portrayal of Psyche as indecisive and amorphous, Huber emphasizes those aspects of the tale that describe Psyche's connectedness - to her sisters, her own sexuali ty, her earth-bound experience and, ultimately, to the birthing of her child. Using the works of such writers as"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"Emily Carr, Margaret Laurence, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf, Huber d emonstrates that feminist theory and women's autobiography mirror the insights uncover ed in her retelling of the Psyche story, a feminist response to Neumann's powerful classic, Amor and Psyche . According to Jean Shinoda-Bolin, \" In the Greek myth of Eros and Psyche, Psyche's story is about the growth of the soul that began with her decision to face the truth, and le d her to being on her own, challenged to complete tasks that were initially beyond her abil ity to perform. In the myth, her unseen bridegroom would come to her in the dark of t he night and be gone by morning. Metaphorically, she was in an unconscious relationship. Fear ing that he could be a monster, Psyche followed her sister's advice, hid a lamp and a knife, and wait ed until he had fallen asleep. She needed the lamp to see him, and the knife to cut off his head if indeed her were a monster. \" \" These two symbols, the lamp and the knife, are both necessary for a psyche--for a s oul--to act decisively when we know the truth. The 'lamp' is a symbol of illuminatio n, of consciousness, the means of seeing a situation clearly. The knife, like the sword, is a symbol of dec isive action, of the capacity to cut through confusion. The lamp without the knife is not adequate; it is insight into the situation with the capacity to act upon this perception . \" \" Myths and symbols are in the language of the soul. A myth helps us to take a situat ion to heart and know what we must do: if it is to see the truth and act upon it, then the image of Psyche with her sword provides a magic perspective. A symbolic object can then be a talisman that helps us to do what we need to do. Like passing a literal torch, these are rituals that empower us by infusing an act with a deeper meaning. To think and act this way is magi cal, metaphoric thinking that can call forth the qualities we need from within ou rselves and may also tap into sources of help that lie beyond us .\" (Jean Shinoda-Bolin). Psyche is a mortal incarnation of Eros' mother, Venus or Aphrodite. Sinc e she is mortal, she represents that part of Eros' anima which is closer to consciousnes s. Venus becomes jealous of Psyche because mortals begin worshipping her beauty, preferr ing her to an abstract Olympian goddess. Psyche's appearance in an account of the Eleusin ian Mysteries points to the identification between Psyche and Isis, and Aphrodite and Isis. One might think that the goddess, then, fights against herself. In a sense, she does. She protests because of the narrowing of her potential into a finite mortal form. If Psyche is Venus in diminutive form, Eros actually takes part in a variation on the theme of sacred marriage with his mother/daughter/sister. This repeats the old Egyptian transformative formula of I.A.O. (Isis-Apophis-Osiris), concerning the mystery of rebirth. Psyche is a form of Kore, the eternal maiden, the mother goddess in rejuve nated, human form. Therefore, the Eros and Psyche tale is a variation of the Demeter-Kore myth (see CHAPTER VIII). For the female initiate, this myth represents t he deepest experience of the female \"ms.teries\" of the Self. For the male initiate, it means a progressive integration of the anima whic h then leads to an experience of the Self. While he is still mother-complexed, all the for ms of the goddess are compounded in the figure of the Great Mother. Without transformation he is her eternal lover who is always subject to fragmentation of his personality (i.e. death and r ebirth). So,"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"the story of Eros and Psyche on various arcs concerns such important human are as as anima (for a man) and animus (for woman); it is also a paradigm of developing relationship, and bears a strong message regarding developmental tasks in th e natural process of women's (or feminine) consciousness raising. The action of the archetype of anima/animus means that we project our unconsc ious idea of the All-Woman or All-Man onto an individual in whom we see this ideal essen ce. No single person can be the carrier of all the divine attributes or qualities we pr oject onto them. When they fail to live up to our unconscious expectations, the process of cons ciousness raising begins. The Venus function is a lens which can magnify or distort. T he story of Eros and Psyche reveals a process of deep metamorphosis and renewal where all the values of the feeling function, emotional life, and moral standards gradually gain new si gnificance and purpose. There is a \"change of heart.\" Eros moves from sexual objectification toward sou lful love; Psyche from projection of her masculine qualities toward empowermen t. Emotionally, they act out the dynamic of the puer/puella immature relationship in the me antime. This naturally leads toward active introspection on the mental level, which re sults in spiritual consciousness raising--a renewed sense of empathy and compassion. This myth resonates with the Tarot trump, THE LOVERS. The Crowley deck s hows an exalted version of the sacred marriage. But more mundane decks generally s how a man flanked on either side by two women competing for his attention. He is in an unconscious relationship with both the more maternal, motherly type and the youn g sensual counterpart who probably represents an immature anima or soul image. These female figures are sometimes polarized as light and dark anima fi gures. If we view the young man as the immature ego, this card can also represent a woman with a spl it between the physical and spiritual aspects of love. Sometimes this dyn amic becomes concretized, \"acted out,\" in life through a love triangle. The ego must bear responsibility for any action it takes in response to the c onflicting figures. In the psychology of both men and women, male figures usually repre sent consciousness, intellectual attainment, and spirit; female figures s ymbolize aspects of the body, emotions, and soul. The polarity is between sexual passions, secret feel ings, and spiritual strivings which exert a definite hold on the ego. Each is compelling in a magical, magnetic way. The ego cannot detach itself from ei ther of them in outer reality since each belongs to its inner reality. If the ego stan ds its ground, and endures the tension of conflicting desires, it can becomes free of th e spell of unconscious projection in either direction. We must come to terms with both ins tinctual draws to gain full stature. This is a step toward individuation. Otherwise we remain in thrall to our feminine, instinctual side which conditions our emotions. We live out a frozen, trance-like state of mystified love, rather than mature, soulful love. The challenge is to connect our spiritual and emotional life, through passion ate involvement in all of life. Then we find ourselves in a new relationship w ith others and in harmony with ourselves, facing each individual conflict and suffering thr ough it to its"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"resolution or transcendence. By facing our fears and pains -- becoming consc ious of our conflicts -- we can find peace. New realizations appear in their embr yonic stage as conflicts which offer us choices in life. These decision points become eith er our life's path or roads- not-taken. Eros, like Fate, is symbolic of the fatal power of attraction which brings o pposites together. He is the incarnating life principle, which ushers in the irrational , passionate intensity which makes transformation possible. He \"turns up the heat\" on the psych ic process; he is that spiritual or divine fire which can unite with instinct. PHYSICAL FORM In the creation myths of many cultures, Primordial Wholeness divided into two polarizing aspects. Together these are known as the \"syzygy\" and indicate an archetypal coupling where one aspect is never separated from the other. In the \"impersonal \" aspect of lunar (or Venusian) experience, the Great Goddess is never separated from her masculine Son- Lover. They are locked in an eternal fascination for one another. One implies the other for wholeness. They exemplify the soul-spirit relationship on a naive level of psychological development. On the \"personal\" level this tandem is expressed as anima/animus. They are the contrasexual component within us all. In other words, these soul figure s embody our latent capacities for expression and realization of the traits normally associated with the opposite sex. Thus, the animus leads a woman to the outer world and promotes her ability i n focused, rational thinking; conversely, the anima guides a man (or our ego) through the inner worlds of relationship. Since anima and animus build a bridge bet ween the conscious and unconscious perspectives, they function as mediators between the known and the \"unknown.\" This is the level of psychological \"complex\" where there is a blending of archetypal realities with our individual experiences. Complexes function lik e psychological \"strange attractors,\" magnetically centering portions of our energy within their par ticular patterns of expression. This magnetic draw is the attractive force of Eros coupled wi th the psychic urge toward manifestation. The imagery of anima/animus is based in archetypal symbolism and in childhood memories of significant others of the opposite sex. This includes parental attitud es and behavior, grandparents' influence, siblings, first-love, caregivers, mentors, and cultural expectations and norms. Anima/animus determines our conceptualization of the ideal mate, and is r esponsible for such phenomena as \"love at first sight,\" and \"star-crossed lovers.\" It take s the elements of fate and destiny and combines them in an impersonal formula, which paradoxic ally feels totally unique. Anima/animus represents the balancing of masculine an d feminine traits in us as individuals. This balancing is a form of sacred marriage, a union which p roduces a magickal child which is the higher Self, much like Eros and Psyche give b irth to Voluptas, deep and abiding pleasure or satisfaction."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"The animus is the masculine personification of the soul. He carries b oth a transcendent spiritual aspect and a personal aspect. He is shown in the tale as a beautiful creature, whom Psyche is at first convinced is a terrible monster-- sort of an \"all men ar e beasts\" programming. Later, she learns his true nature. Anima/animus are potenti al guides to the depths of the unconscious, forming a bridge to daily life. They are factors whi ch transcend consciousness, both light and dark. So in a relationship which seems to have everything going for it, there can be friction or \"animosity\" produced by the unconsciou s forces (complexes) operating below the surface. Most of these troubles stem from projecting the anima/animus image onto ou r loved ones, then maneuvering them into fulfilling our expectations. Internal confli cts come from the split nature of anima/animus which we experience in modern life. Th is again revolves mainly around the gulf between the \"spiritual\" and \"sensual\" aspect s of the inner figure. For example, a Madonna/whore complex, which is a split between the holy mothe r and the erotic love goddess. Or, the spiritual animus might be projected onto the f igure of a wise man, a ghostly lover to whom a woman faithfully goes in her fantasy-life, or onto an idealized brother/sister relationship devoid of sexual options. Reality must be found between idealized (virtually non-existant) re lationships and degraded relationships. The sensual animus may be presented as darke r gods of impersonal sexuality, phallic or obscene in nature. In any event, the animus r epresents a woman's need for creative expression. The more fully she can manifest thi s trait, the better her inner relationship to the animus becomes. He provides her with i nner light, not inspiration which is a function of her anima nature, the core of her Se lf. Anima/animus excite those feelings of longing, awe, fear of the unknown , and incomprehensibility. They imply that when we love deeply, we open ourselve s to the possibility of betrayal and the pain of separation. We open ourselves to woundi ng, and this very woundedness is our openness. The transpersonal power of love can appear as an obsession or possession by another, against which rational thought is no protect ion.

Her s isters: complete cave dwellers who behave like envious sisters in fairy tales every where. Eros is the principle of desire for the good. Venus is placer of difficulties in Psyche's way. Psych e finally marries Cupid and becomes a goddess--the philosopher's soul by pursing divi ne desires can become immortal. The myth of Psyche and Eros is a wake-up call to the Soul. On archet ypal levels, this awakening can only occur through the call of the Beloved, represented i n this story by Eros. The myth begins with the birth of a young girl, Psyche, whose beauty surpasses that of Aphrodite, representative of the collective consensus stuck in old ways and refusing to grow. She resents Psyche's beauty and to seek vengeance enlists the help of her son/lover, Eros, to shoot one of his arrows at her so that she will be \"consumed with passi on for a man who bring her endless agony.\" Meanwhile, no one will marry Psyche, as her beauty is so great that it is per ceived as \"too much\" and loneliness ensues. In desperation, her father seeks the advi ce of an oracle and is informed that she is to wed \"Death.\" She is attired in funeral garb and l ed to a high mountain crag where she awaits her fate. Eros, having been commanded by his mothe r, is awaiting nearby and seeing her for the first time is so struck with her b eauty that he accidentally pricks his own hand with one of his arrows and falls de eply in love with Psyche. Instead of falling off of the cliff, the winds carry her to an idylli c paradise and she becomes the bride of Love/Eros. This myth has many layers of depth and meaning. The beauty of Psyche speaks of the beauty of our Soul, which if unexpressed and in an unawakened state, there i s no metamorphosis, growth or transformation. This equates to Death in an archetyp al sense. The call of the Beloved, Love/Eros, lures us into becoming more, reachin g for more, unfolding and blossoming. The \"too much\" beauty of our Soul is often times shunned in our world when fully expressed, and we often want to retreat back into t he quietness of slumber. It is a wake-up call to the Soul individually, but in grander terms a wake-up call to all Souls of the collective conscious, as we sleepwalk through our global devastation and destruction caused by wars and other travesties. It is also a wake-up call to perceive all t he beauties that surround us in our world daily that go unnoticed by the sleeping Soul. Th is is not meant to be a sounding of an alarm, but a gentle reminder of awakening through the gi ft of Love. Listen to the call of your Beloved to gently awaken your Soul and walk in awe of your own beauty. How does this myth of the divine lovers play out in modern emotional life? It is a m etaphor of psychological growth -- \"bringing up Psyche.\" It identifies certain d evelopmental tasks fundamental to mature identity and the ability to love fully, such as sorti ng out feelings, setting appropriate boundaries, owning projections, developing a dispassi onate Observer Self, and empowerment with compassion. When relationships get stalled this process is stuck in the immatur e stage. John Bradshaw calls these \"mystified relationships,\" still enmeshed in the dynam ics of the very early family life of the partners. The issues of safety and trust are unresolved . These are"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"relationships which stick together for the sake of the children, and the \"children\" are the regressive personalities of the lovers. The healthy Eros/Psyche relationship is one of empathy and intimacy, safet y and passion. It is joyful and totally relaxed. When conflicts come up, as they inevitably will, th ere are means of negotiation. This is \"soulful\" love which includes many results of self- consciousness. It is generative in nature. There is bonding, commitment , vulnerability, self- disclosure, sensuality, ecstasy, as well as respect, caring, belonging,together ness, toleration, and constancy. Jeffrey Satinover, (M.D., physicist and Jungian analyst), examines the role of t he Self in relationship in a tape called, \"BEING SEPARATE, BEING TOGETHER.\" Th is talk is from a Jungian conference on wounding and healing in relationships. Every anal yst knows that healthy, loving relationships are more healing than all the therapy in the w orld. The tale of Eros and Psyche is with us today in the psychological complex known as \"puer/puella,\" (boy/girl). They are stuck at the adolescent stage of devel opment. This same complex is imaged in the Tarot Trump, VI, THE LOVERS. Much of psychic life remains hidden as in the initial stages of the myth. T his includes secret thoughts, feelings, fears, criticisms, anticipations, etc. A psychological i nitiation occurs when we are suddenly forced to \"go within\" ourselves and discover or \"own \" the subconscious processes operating there. Gradually, we begin to recogniz e that relationship involves chronic \"wounding and healing.\" In the myth, for example, Psyche sp ills hot oil on Eros while trying to see what he looks like during his sleep. In love, the root experience is of the archetype of the Self. The broad, dee p emotional experience coupled with detachment vacillates from impulse to action . This Self is the root of emotions when the ego is identified with it. The Self remains ineff able, or unknown, and is too sacred to be expressed in words. We experience the Self as our inner childlike nature when we act out a pattern of cyclic instability in our lovelife. We don't relat e \"adult to adult,\" but \"wounded child to wounded child.\" Neediness on both part s keeps the legitimate needs of both from being met. There are periods of despair an d exaltation, wounding and healing. This is a variation of the archetype of the dying and resurrecting god. In its se lf-reflecting narcissism, this complex provides no stable sense of identity. We ask ours elves, \"Who am I, and why can't I behave as I'd like to?\" Some people seek therapy for this very ab sence of a stable sense of identity, after trying to form a false identity as a couple. Love brings alterations and fluctuations between feelings of fear, of \"be ing nobody,\" or worthless when we are wounded, or feeling special and precious when th ings are going well. These feelings may change rapidly depending on the emotional climate, and this is an unsettling feeling. The chronic emotion is a feeling of overwhelming longi ng for support of the loved one, coupled with feelings of extreme emptiness when the b eloved is gone. Possessive jealousy comes from projecting our own negative self-image on to the rival who seems to succeed in an area where we have failed the loved one."},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"When the Self begins operating in an individual, the ego automatically begins acting defensively to protect itself against the intolerable sense of fragmentat ion which it anticipates will follow. The feeling of being unique and whole alt ernates with self-defense against feeling wounded and worthless. The defense consists of cutti ng off the roots of all intense emotional experience with the beloved, and may even extend into oth er friendships. Some people seek solace in the predictable gratification of alcohol or drugs as substitutes for the unpredictable pleasures of love. The Self's proper role in relationship is concerned with self-an alysis or getting to knowone's inner workings better. Each marriage or relationship consis ts of a union among four aspects -- the normal consciousness of the partners and their sub conscious or inner Self. Thus, a woman loves not only a man as he behaves in outer life, but his inner \"feminine\" soul; a man embraces his wife and her inner \"masculine\" soul. This relationship was depicted in alchemy as the marriage of the alchemist and his mystic sister who is his inner nature. Instead of depending on one another for a sense of self-value (co-dependen ce), self-esteem emerges from within through reflective introversion. We can mirror, vali date, and support ourselves when we listen to our inner nurturing voice. When we explore our own personal depths, we come into our daily relationships as whole people. Then we can f orm truly interdependent, reciprocal relationships. \"Falling in love\" is a vehicle for the experience of the self. This exper ience, or even yearning for it, influences our daily life and human experience tremend ously. As they say, \"Love makes the world go around.\" Yet it automatically means there will be a fragmentation of personality following sooner or later, since an unconscious d ynamic process has been unleashed. The old personality must be dissolved befor e the new structure co-created by the partners can be established. Difficulties and disappointments follow when the other doesn't r eflect back the expected sense of specialness or idealness. We often hold ideals of relationship w hich we have never seen and could not exist in real life. In an attempt to actualize our fantasy li fe, we unconsciously compel or manipulate the other person to fulfill it. Th ere is a simultaneous attachment or identification of the ego with the vast potential of the Self , which no partner can maintain. When one partner doesn't fulfill expectations, the addictive yearning to exp erience the specialness of the Self changes into an indifference to the other whic h is not genuine. This is a reactionary defense against the Self in that both the unique and fragmen tary periods produce pain for the ego. It is difficult for the ego to \"live up\" to the ide alized image, also. There is a pressure on the ego to live the demands of the Self, or cut them off entirely in a negative defensive move. Longing and disappointment change to seeming indif ference and then the person begins to seek outward. This is a compulsive drive to re create the appearance of the Self through yet another lover. The feeling of jealousy in the d eserted party comes from feeling possessive of the lover as something of one's own, an d experiencing the loss of Self, or even fear of the loss of Self. The type of attac hment that"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"believes the other is responsible for the experience of the specialn ess of the self leads inevitably to painful separations. There is a \"way of being together\" in which both partners maintain separ ate identities. They are distinct, yet conjoined. In this liberated experience ther e is emotional intensity combined with detachment from compulsion. When each person exper iences the Self with some degree of autonomy from identification with the ego, there is reducti on of the strain in maintaining the Self of the other. We cease to make such exaggerated demand s on one another. We let go of the reactionary stage of power struggles, and become emotionall y independent. The power-struggles (counterdependence) in relationship aren't f or power, per se. They are manipulations and desperate maneuverings of the partners to maintain t heir individual sense of Self. These struggles are a natural stage which comes prior to t rue independence, individuation, or self-actualization. True lovers are partners as well as fri ends and lovers -- head and heart, feeling and intellect combine. The associations of a complex can be detached from an image which should be arc hetypal. We can consciously separate out what is personal and human from what is archetyp al and divine. We don't need to confuse our lovers with divine archetypal powers, thou gh we each carry a divine component. When we reown our projections, the other doesn't carry the burden of our sp irituality for us. The spiritual problem is no longer disguised as a relationship proble m. Our relationship with the higher power becomes direct. When each individual has an in ternal relationship with the Self, the other partner is not forced to carry and reinforce the projection of the Self. They are no longer exposed to the intense disappointment of the lover when they inevitably fail to live up to god-like qualities which only a higher power c an carry.

We need to examine our own feelings and thoughts, not pass t he buck for our unhappiness onto our partners. Psyche abandoned by Eros becomes lovesic k or depressed. In \"Depression: Soul's Quest for Depth, Meaning & Wholeness\" Maureen Roberts, PhD explores the prospective meaning of depression. Sufferers of depression are often forced to endure, in addition to thei r pain and energy loss, the stigma of being told that they're 'ill', hence that their depressi on is a problem to be eliminated, or that it has no value, meaning, or purpose. From a soul-centred pe rspective, however, depression is not primarily another word for unhappiness; nor is it 'mental illness.' It is, rather, in many instances a response to soullessness (or what shamans call 'soul loss'), including, ironically enough, the soullessness of the mater ialist medical model which continues to 'treat' depression as a biologic illness that can be To achieve genuine individual and cultural healing, we need, instead, more w holeness , that is, more soulful and well-rounded individuals who embody life's danc e of opposites and in so doing live fully human, fully divine lives. We need more people who are not as hamed of, or embarrassed by their pain, but who can instead respond to their own and oth ers' suffering - as an unavoidable facet of the human condition - with love, patien ce, sympathy, nurturing and respect. True happiness, after all, does not exclude sadness, but rather embraces i t within the living paradox which personal wholeness demands. As the quiet contentednes s of joy, such happiness is not attained by seeking happiness, nor by eliminating sadne ss through addressing purely personal wants, needs, fears, anxieties and insecur ities. Indeed, a reactionary cult of 'happiness', based on the indiscriminate elimi nation of all psychospiritual suffering, is in the longrun as lopsided, narrow, false, r epressive and self- defeating as the current 'epidemic' of depression. Endorsing happine ss above sadness, in other words, simply amounts to replacing one extreme (which is falsely view ed in a totally negative light) with its opposite, which is seen as positive. In reality, t hough, not all happiness is positive - and not all depression is 'bad'. From soul's angle, far from being an 'insidious illness', depression is often a valuable phase of a person's life journey, a critical juncture at which a soul-searchi ng re-assessment of priorites, directions, relationships, work, gifts, self-image, home li fe, spirituality and/or values is being called for. For this reason, dreams and myths often contai n the theme of the 'buried treasure', symbolically the soul hidden, or trapped in the un conscious depths, which the hero or heroine must retrieve in order to become healed, mat ure, content and whole. Mythically, the gods reside not only in celestial realms, but also down below in Underworld, the mythic equivalent of the unconscious. Soul, which unli ke light, airy 'spirit', gravitates to the body, the Earth and the watery realms of night and oce an depth,"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"does not lift us to mountainous heights, but pulls us - when it's neglect ed, stifled, or shunned - down into neurosis, depression, suicide, psychosis and psychos piritual chaos. As an example, in the Greek myth of the human girl Psyche, whose name mean s 'soul', Psyche abandoned by Eros (the divine Love which soul needs) is left alone, di rectionless, depressed - literally, 'pulled down' - hence she is finally driven t o Underworld depths. For Eros, mysterious god of entanglements in relationship, involvement with li fe, immersion in suffering, depth and joy, is the god behind human vulnerability, the one who e xposes us, through love, betrayal, cruelty and kindness, to life's inseparable blend of w oundedness and pleasure. Psyche, in other words, is a myth that provides a 'psych-ological' context for und erstanding depression as soul's need to descend in order to retrieve its Underw orld treasure. By exploring depression from this soul-centred perspective, we have thu s re-mythologized a universal (archetypal) human experience: soul's hunger for depth and f or the elusive riches harboured by Hades, Lord of the dark Underworld of the unconscious. Just as P syche had to journey 'down under' to find her way back to lost Eros, so we shall be driven t o the depths of our wounds, depressions, madness and fears in order to be reun ited with lost soul. In the shamanic vision that this re-mythologizing of our lives is the medici ne we need if we are to help one another reconnect to a life wrestled with, shared and cel ebrated in all its fullness, vibrancy, imaginal richness, pain and joy. With this guiding vision at he art, the following soul-centred delineation of depression offers itself as a yeast, vessel and catalyst to help reactivate the sense of soul within the individual, in the flou ndering field of mental health, and throughout global culture as a whole. Depression, which literally means 'a lowering', occurs when energy (libi do) which is normally available for day-to-day conscious living, becomes depleted, blocked, p ulled down, or trapped in the depths of the unconscious. Depression can arise t hrough endless combinations of psychospiritual and physical causes, but in many cases, it s primary source is an unresolved, repressed, or forgotten grief, trauma, crisis, conflict or l oss. In addition, depression is often an emotional, relational and spiritual response to a se nse of meaninglessness, lack of harmony with Nature, or lack of truthfulness wi th oneself and others. Poor diet, seasonal changes, lack of sunshine and lack of exercise can contribute to depression, as can soulless environments, materialism, lack of imagination , damaging relationships, dull routine, empty forms of work, and apparent lack of life purpose. Depression is a natural human response to an endless variety of circumstanc es and states of unresolved suffering, or tension within the psyche. While it can be debi litating (for example, in cases of repressed conflict, extreme crisis, or forgotten chi ldhood trauma), it can also have a creative outcome. For example, some depressions are caused b y a lowering of consciousness in order to retrieve needed wisdom, or creative and he aling gifts from the unconscious. This kind of depression is best dramatized as myth, when the hero or heroine must go through a symbolic death and rebirth. Examples of such myths are Dionysus, Osir is, Christ, Demeter and Persephone, Orpheus and Eurydice. Reading and re flecting on such"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"myths can help provide an imaginal context for soul's journey through depr ession. Bear in mind that the depression is never the end of the story. There's always a re birth at the end of the journey! The Self is a powerful internal dynamism of positive and negative manifes tations which range from despair to exaltation. Since it symbolizes this entire range of e motion, you can't depend on it like a benevolent parent. When each partner isn't held resp onsible for what they are, they have the option of acting with charity or benevolence, instead of out of a compulsion to control one another. The nature of any relationship cannot be predicted from the qualities of the separate people involved. For example, oxygen and hydrogen chemistries do not predict th e emergent properties of their combination in water. Both are comple tely altered in the process of uniting. When people enter a relationship, there is a trans-FORM-ation of personali ty. The old form of the ego must die to be reborn in service to the relationship. Even t he word 'transformation' contains images which intimate a knowledge of the fear of d eath. Morphe- (also in metamorphosis) means to gleam or sparkle with an appearance seen as beauty. \"Trans-\" contains images of piercing, mutilation, or maiming. These images of needs and distress produce relationship, but not idealism. Eros embodies both compulsion and inhibition. We are both anxious and wary or lee ry of love. Love and fear seem to go together. The natural inhibitions of Eros need not b e overcome. They are his way of eventually getting in touch with Psyche on a more pr ofound level. Eros embodies both creative and destructive instincts, theref ore love can be a long process of being wounded and regenerated. Psyche would still be a virgin if she and Eros didn't go through this cycle. She is the reflective instinct, who woul d still be fascinated with her own dreams and visions if Eros didn't change her. Eros makes Psyche's potential fertility into a regeneration of the power of love. At last, Eros and Psyche are united in vitality and passion through the imaginal aspect s of interested love. The archetypal patterns are not only perceived in life, there is an active participation in the cycle. There is a suffering of impossible love unti l Psyche's soul work, symbolized by her tasks, is completed. Then a psychologically creative union produces experiences of pleasure, the \"Pleasure born of the soul.\" There is per ception of the dimension of immortality intimated by love. How does the heart open to the other? This riddle has long obsessed human-k ind. In the blink of an eye, Eros's dart pierces the shield of isolation, and fragmentat ion is no more. A new question appears: who am I who is so easily smitten? The first lesson of t he lover is vulnerability. Acceptance is indeed a work. To allow love to show its beauty, th e soul must submit to onerous trials, as Harriet Eisman describes in her study of the tale of Eros and Psyche. If we harden our position, and our hearts, into thinking that love is ou r due and not an earning, then the end of this story is all too familiar. Love turns into its opposite, attachment. The ego may immediately inflate to an even larger size, forsaking th e call of integration. The addiction of a Cassanova or Don Juan is the self-centered soluti on to love's enigma."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Yet if we accept the \"wound\" of love, a bridge to what Jacob Needlemancalls anoth er level of being springs into existence. Wholeness, advaita, nirvana: different tradit ions express the same mystery of crossing over. In each, the embrace of a non-dual consciou sness frees us from the desire of conquest. In this way, we are touched by the myst ery in which love blends two into one that yet remain different. If we accept, what must be accepted is the essential incompletene ss of our humanity. In Plato's image, we once were eight-limbed and double-sexed, but were b isected by gods who feared for their power. Moved by erotic desire, we now perpetually and uns uccessfully seek our \"other half.\" However the relentless pull is explained, poetry of all ages, as Sam Hamill shows, celebrates longing for union with the beloved. Eros, erotic love, find s us unexpectedly, without warning, and instantly we are all attention. Called back from dreams, we are again ready to meet joys and sorrows of the hero's journey. But what i f we find total fulfillment in our beloved and forget the unending role of th e hero?

SPIRITUAL MYTH"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"The tale of Eros and Psyche relates the trials and tribulations of a maturin g love affair. It means moving from separation and control toward praise, honor, and love. It occurs wit hin the psyche through the process of metamorphosis. In fact, the Greek wor d 'Psyche' means butterfly and this process of essential restructuring involves cocooni ng and re-emergence in the new, potentiated form. The failure or stalling of this natural growth proc ess is a spiritual issue, and may become a spiritual problem, which most frequen tly is perceived as a relationship problem. Eros and Psyche are the primordial lovers. In this context Eros is more of a t ranspersonal daimon than a god. The Gods relate among themselves, but a daimon mediates betwe en gods and men. Psyche is a diminutive incarnation of Eros' mother, Aphrodite. S he personifies the anima and positive mother-complex. By her attributes, w e can see that Eros has a good feeling relationship with women and the unconscious, but one whi ch is still too naive. His attitudes toward love are idealized. Eros himself has been acting like the archetypal Don Juan before his encou nter with Psyche, expressing the pattern of behavior his mother favors. This show s he is still identified with her, still in the grips of the puer complex. He is a son-lover, still compelled to serve his mama. Aphrodite is jealous of her own incarnation in matter. This deep level of the unconscious does not wish her son to develop out of his naive, unquestioning attitude towar d her role and desires for him. She is angry and tries to destroy Psyche or Eros' refle ctive ability. She realizes that Psyche embodies the mother-complex of Eros, but as his anima image is closer to consciousness than she is. Things proceed well, though blindly, in the newlywed's paradisical re alm until Aphrodite stirs up trouble by sending in Psyche's jealous sisters. These siste rs instill grave doubts in Psyche regarding her lover. They are too skeptical, too cynical, and too aware of the mundane side of relationship. Secretly, they wish they could recapture some of Psyche's naive roman tic attitudes in their own relationships. The closeness of their friendship opens the doorway for envy to enter. What is needed, though is a mature attitude which recognizes the paradox of love . There is always a divine and banal aspect to relationships. Both together represent a real istic, well- rounded experience, that is neither debased nor idealized. Psyche begins her marriage as mortals do by being \"in love.\" She is contain ed in a very unconscious state in the palace of Eros. She is possessed by love -- in love wi th love. She longs for that superhuman quality of perfection in her lover. However, her hum anness makes it necessary for her to make a transition to being consciously loving, acce pting imperfection. All of the forces which surround her conspire to make this absolutely necessary. The agents of this process include Psyche's inner desire toward consciousness, the sisters, Aphrodite, and Eros himself. She needs to divest hersel f of her myths about relationship and personal growth. Eros compels her by remaining in the dark. His soul is still in the grip s of primitive passion -- sexual objectification. So, of course, after a time, Psyche resolves that sh e wants a real"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"relationship and wants to see her lover \"as he really is.\" She has wearied of \"nothing but sexuality.\" Her real motivation is her fear, but the unconscious has its ow n, as-yet- unknown goal. She also has the burning passion which wants to know real l ove. When she surrenders to the mysteries of the soul, she embodies the ge nuine, personal love. Paradoxically, at this point, Eros flees her (incapable of emotional intimacy). A phrodite (in an attempt to destroy her) sets the tasks which further her inner de velopment. These are experienced as insurmountable problems, and she has suicidal impul ses at each difficult point. These symbolize her readiness for self-sacrifice, but also allo w her to transform from one level of consciousness to another. Psyche's first task, sorting a huge pile of seeds, is set by Aphrodite. Psy che's biological instincts come to her aid in the form of ants. This \"ant-quality\" is a prim itive, quiet quality which is part of her inner masculinity. It is a discriminating funct ion of Eros. In fact, she has instinctually discriminated and sorted seed in a literal sense. Sh e becomes pregnant by Eros while still in the paradisical state of unconsciousness. Even thou gh she has seen the divine quality of her lover, she is no longer only animus possessed, but begins to live woman's inner biological mystery. In a way, Eros is with her through all the trial s in her inner world as her incubating child. She regains enough faith to tackle the second task which is gathering some f leece from the \"golden rams of the sun.\" This time, she earns a bit of the Logos, or the power of t he spiritual impulse, which is a trait of masculine consciousness. But sh e does it, thanks to wise counsel, by avoiding direct contact with it in its destructive for m. She can wield some masculine power, but need not gain it in an aggressive w ay. She is coming to know Eros' nature better, even though he is not there. Psyche i s coming to know and understand him from the inside out, by contacting her inner animus, ac knowledging the potential of her inner masculinity, while remaining absolutely fem inine to the core. Through this process, she is coming to know herself. Psyche is mustering her inner strengths as well as courage and valor; but true to form, she collapses at the prospect of the third test. Aphrodite makes the trial s progressively harder. This time she must fill a crystal goblet with water from the river St yx, the powerful current of psychic energy. Psyche succeeds in capturing a bit of this river of life with the help of Ganymede, an eagle sacred to Zeus. This eagle represents high-flying spiritual intuiti on. She is, once again, saved from destruction by an act of grace. By dipping only a small amount from the rive r of libido, her fragile ego (the container) is not shattered. By listening to h er quiet, inner guiding voice, Psyche was able to complete her nearly impossible task, throu gh methodical concentration. Psyche's ability to touch her unconscious depths gave her ac cess to the creative solution. She understood this through an intuitive vision. The final test involves a terrible journey to the underworld. One nee ds proper guidance for such a journey. Modern examples of this task of making Psyche more conscious include the therapeutic process of individuation and spiritual disciplines li ke yoga and mysticism.

We become progressively m ore enlightened by shedding our illusions about self and world. It requires all of the e nergy and resources we can muster. Once begun it must be followed through to the end. Psyche fortunately acquires the treasure of the subconscious as the bo x of divine beauty which Aphrodite has demanded of her. The beauty of Persephone is the res plendence of the most profound depths of the feminine Self. Betty Meador calls it \"the awesome and overpowering essence of death and resurrection, the passage of the female god dess through the dark regions of Hell into rebirth and transformation.\" This process was the subject of both the Isis and Eleusinian Mysteries. On her return from the underworld (subconscious), for love of Eros, Psych e opens the box of beauty ointment. Seeking to make herself more desirable to Eros, (and in advertently cheating Aphrodite), she does not have the courage to face Eros as herself. She want to remain disguised in Eros' anima projections, which hark back his mothe r-complex. Her fantasy is that then they could continue to share the paradisical state. True, she does this for love of Eros, but this keeps him in his adolescent phase, devoid of the maturity a real relationship would bring. She regresses into an unc onscious state of deep sleep. She becomes a \"sleeping beauty.\" In this apparent failure, she shows herself to be most human! How unbearably egotistical Psyche might have been if she had c ompleted the tasks perfectly. Through her regression into humanness, Eros is rede emed from his boyish hangups and allowed to mature. He can show some true love, rather than in stinctual reproductive passion. Through his love Eros redeems Psyche and awakens her to an understanding of the archetypal functioning of the animus as a bridge to the divine. She is transf ormed from her mortal condition to an awareness of her own immortality of soul. Together they experience the birth of their child as joy, mutual ecstasy, a nd the pleasure of life and love. There is a blending of the human and divine qualities in l ove. The opposites merge in mutual love, and experience unification on a profound level whi ch has both depth and conscious awareness. Eros is contained within Psyche. The reproduct ive instinct transforms into a highly differentiated feeling function, and Psyche goe s through rebirth which frees her \"butterfly\" nature. Feeling is a reflective func tion which requires time more than perception. When Psyche evokes true feelings from Eros, her tas k is complete. Daily life is connected with archetypal reality.

He is the inner witness, the agent within the seeker that unfolds gnosis, or divine knowledge. This divine knowledge awakens high er levels of consciousness within him and, in turn, these levels of consciousness aroused by Eros lead the seeker back to the source of light. The Greek mysteries relate that at the very beginning of creation, only c haos existed, and from chaos was born the cosmogonic Eros. Elsewhere, according to mythology, we are tol d that amongst the gods, Eros was the most handsome. This is how theogonia (the bir th of the gods) begins and we are assured that the poet Isiodos heard it from the mouth of the Muse herself. According to Isiodos, Eros represents the driving force behind the entire theogonia. The Orphics agree that Eros appears at the beginning of theogonia and cosmogonia i n general, and they tell us that his mother was Night, the dark goddess, and his father the Wind. From their first cosmic and elemental embrace, Eros was born from a silver egg. For the Greeks, the essence of Eros is the unfoldment of human thought , and in Greek philosophy, he is described as a liberating agent who releases and activates the creative process of the mind. Eros inspires and opens the channel of intuition to the higher and abstract understanding and communion with beauty and truth. The myth of E ros and Psyche describes in detail the inner process of transformation. In fac t, Eros cannot be separated from his beloved Psyche, since they are united by a secret and s acred bond, invisible and unconscious in man. In fact, man’s psyche remains filled with erotic, sensual, carnal desires that keep him and his mind trapped on the physical plan e along with his emotions and consciousness. But a seeker must transmute the attract ion of Eros and awaken the bond with his psyche so that he can rise towards the \"beloved,\" the invisible golden thread that links his consciousness to the universal qualities of beauty and love. The gifts of Eros affect the emotional and thought processes of humanity, esp ecially those of a seeker who has to learn how to open up and integrate these gifts in his psych e. From the lowest and most physical levels of consciousness to the most spiritu al ones, Eros remains forever present,gradually transforming the inner fire into pure light. Eros operates in every living creature, and Greek poetry and philosophy describe h ow nature partakes of the gift of Eros. Hence we could say that Eros’ contribution to hum anity is not only inherent in man’s psyche, but that it is also involved in the process t hat awakens the ego to its true nature, the beauty and unconditional love of the soul. This awakening activated by Eros and Aphrodite reveals the qualities of pu re love and gnosis in the consciousness of the seeker. This level of consciousness c annot be described, however, because it is itself a higher aspect of intelligence in which abstract knowledge and impersonal love are combined. We could simply call this level of awakening, wi sdom. So, on one hand, Eros can simply mean carnal love and desire for material possessi ons, but on the other, it can also express the spiritual energy that attracts and leads t he psyche towards the Center of Pure Being, where the beauty and love of the soul are revealed. Many Greek philosophers, Plato and Pythagoras included, said the same thi ng—that beauty and gnosis are inseparable and inherent in the essence of Eros. Thus , we understand that in the psyche of man, Eros rules over his carnal desires b ut also over his higher aspirations and longing for wisdom. This is not the playful cupid, the winged son of Aphrodite and Mars, but an elderly primordial deity, worshiped by the anci ent Greeks as"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"the first element of the primordial creative cause, the element th at binds and attracts spirit and matter together. Greek philosophers saw the spirit of Dionysus penetrating the whole of nature and binding together the two aspects of Eros, the penetration and blending energy of mat ter with its counterpart and complement, spirit. Esoterically, Eros is the leading f orce within a seeker that takes him away from a level of duality to a level of unity and wholeness. Furt hermore, Eros is the key to transforming psychic vibratory rates. He does that by placing a se eker on his axial center, the neutral and timeless zone within his conscious se lf. This level of being brings about the integration of ego with soul. Hence, Eros is the god or essence that gives us the possibility of letting go of the past and living in the present mom ent, embracing spontaneously everything within and without our reach. Eros allows us to see everything as part of our own nature. He also shows us how t o transmute carnal and unconscious attractions and desires of all kinds, and how to re-direct and reintegrate their energies back into the center of pure love and wis dom. This inner process must be conscious, because the ego and psyche must harmonize and unite before being invited to enter into the higher realms, where the qualities and gi fts of Eros are awakened. On that level of achievement and realization, the seeker receives more gifts from Eros who directs him towards his own invisible and sacred Center of Pure Being, not really a \"place\" at all, but more a level of being and attunement. This is a level of cons ciousness where the essence of pure love and beauty manifest themselves through or dinary consciousness and can be said to be a part of the undivided unique consci ousness of the whole of creation. In Symposium , Plato expounded that Eros had two aspects, one physical the other intellectual, i.e., wisdom. He knew that they had to harmonize and blend so as to t ransform ordinary men into heroes. According to Empedocles, \"Aphrodite is Eros him self,\" the immortal force that unites and harmoniously blends together all the ele ments in nature, the \"bringer\" and \"giver\" of life. He also said, \"the path to knowledge can be achi eved only through Eros himself. The energy represented by Eros brings about a balance between pleasure, delight and gnosis, and this harmonious and enthusiastic searc h for gnosis comes not so much from the answers one receives but more from the search it self.\" Hence the quest goes on forever, since pleasure and gnosis go hand-in-hand an d cannot be separated. Eros questions everything because he loves wisdom and is, theref ore, the living source at the center of Greek philosophy. So Eros teaches the Greeks h ow to become free and fearless in the face of the unknown. He invites them to follow the p ath of knowledge and apply the sacred principles of freedom and equality, qualities that b elong to Eros’ mother, Aphrodite, whom Empedocles identifies with Eros for, withou t the freedom and courage to explore our inner nature with imagination and intuition, we remai n unconscious prisoners of conventional ideas, routines and vicious circles. Hence, Eros is himself the \"mixer of the seeds and sperms\" in creation , the primal cause, the bringer of life in the womb of nature. Eros’s gift to the seeker, there fore, is the transmuting energy of pure love, which is synonymous with the Logos. The olde st mythology of Homer does not mention Eros. Apparently Eros was not born out of a popular tradition but he is the creation of an abstract philosophical con ception."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"In Greek esoteric philosophy, the Eros of theogonia took part in the creation of life itself.

It portrays Eros , the universal power of union and love, the agent that brings a new level of consciousness to t he seeker, and of \"being alive\" in the world. Eros is shown pointing his arrow towards the seeker’s crown chakra, meaning that the seeker is in a higher initiation that will un ite the two opposites and paradoxical sides within himself, and blend them on his axi al level. In that axial inner space within his being, the soul reveals itself to the seeker in many subtle ways. The gifts of Eros are many and they manifest in the ever-fleeting present as sudden bursts of enlightenment and intuition that are part of a transcendent primordial knowledge that gradually unfolds in his life. Interpret this card as representing a high level of initiation that cor responds to a baptism of fire, or the awakening in a seeker of a higher level of the abstract mind that remains a grace and a sacred mystery. Receiving the \"wound\" of the arrow of Eros illuminat es the ego, or the limited mind of a seeker, and opens it up to receive higher trut h, from where it unites itself with the source of the primordial tradition. The cons cious choice of the seeker to enter a new dimension of being comes after his spiritual transformation and rebirth when the arrow of Eros opens his crown chakra, and from that opening, spiritu al love pours down and inundates the psyche of the seeker who, from that momen t on, transforms from being a lover of self to a lover of God.

Charles triangulated the relationship from the beginning, leaving room only for pseudointimacy based on false-self roles.

DIALOGUE WITH EROS & PSYCHE You may use a little self-reminder, when caught in old emotional patterns i n your relationships. Just \"Ask your Anima!\" or animus, discussing it with the c ontrasexual aspect of yourself. Even if the discussion is not fluid, the response of t he inner figure will be quite revealing. Is there envy, competition, immaturity, narcissism, or an op ening for safely revealing yourself to the \"other\"? Notice how your beloved is similar to or different from your parent and idealiz ed anima or animus image. What is realistic. Remember, no one will ever love you truly uncond itionally simply because they are human. Also remember, the archetypal dynamic operat es in, through, and behind all human relationship, conditioning it with its ow n divine agenda irrespective of our personal needs.

Home is whe re the heart/hearth is. Each city had a public hearth sacred to Hestia, where the fire was never allowed to go out. At festivals she was the first goddess invoked, and she was als o offered blessings at the beginning of each meal. Hestia was also one of the three virgi n goddesses, and turned away both Poseidon and Apollo. She petitioned Zeus to remain a virgi n and he respected this right. Hestia was originally one of the twelve supreme gods on Mount Olympus, but she gr ew tired of the petty intrigues and wrangling that went on amongst the Olymp ians. So she gave up her position, her throne to Dionysus, the god of wine. As a result, it was sai d that she still received part of every offering made to the gods. This trump in the Tarot is THE CHARIOT which represents the veh icle of conveyance for consciousness. The Chariot allows us to take consciousness journeys throu gh the wide realm of the imagination. It harnesses the opposites to create volition. This requires a turning inward from the vast array of stimulation bombarding our senses from the outside, and finding a still center. Riding on this Chariot, the Throne Chariot of G od, the wheels turn, but the axle moveth not. This is the prudent, balanced life, open to th e inner self and quietude, pursuing the conquest of illusion. Receptivity is incre ased by silence, retirement from participation. The path of the Chariot transcends all sense of \"my-ness\"and is seldom personal in its implications. It describes someone who has conscious awareness of purp ose; already refined in body, mind, heart and soul to be a clear vehicle for the presenc e of Indwelling Spirit (Compton, 1991). In the physical world, it is the field of all undif ferentiated substance; alteration, vibration, flux and reflux, involution and evolution, and also culture, education and growth. Water, in both metaphysical and Jungian terminology, represents the \"sea of the unconscious,\" in metaphysics, the ocean of pure, clear Light. It is the res toration of the Word, the \"Voice of the Silence,\" which contains secrets uncommunicab le with human tongue. In Kabbala, Shekinah is revealed through the alchemy of letters thems elves. Occult speech, or meditation by passes the mind and influences us through the subconscious. Spirit then flows in abundance. Form becomes a vehicle for Spirit's intention, and form is directed t oward its ultimate reunion with its Source. 'Cheth' is the enclosure or container of spir itual essence. The Chariot is the carrier of our own special journey toward individuation. The h uman personality is likened to a chariot, the vehicle of our lives. It is 'rest wi thin movement,' loss of sense of self-identity, pure non-attachment without cravings. The goddess of this deep center or introversion is Hestia. She helps u s find that quiet state of consciousness which characterizes contemplation and meditation . She helps us focus our attention inward in a non-heroic, non-linear manner. Hestia is essentiall y a goddess of meditation and a balanced lifestyle. She is the Will to be receptive to th e influx of higher power, to digest both inner and outer experience which increases foresi ght or circumspection. She finds ways to express the exalted aspects of love."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"What we call 'volition' is the synthesis of all the universal forces coming t o a focus at a point within us. It is the Will, the power of choosing; a conscious choice or decision, sometimes measured by our ability to \"let go.\" It means the choice betw een our idealized, glamorized fantasies and plain, simple reality. It means abandoning even 'posi tive' thinking which is a polarity, for an unvarnished truth -- discretion, discernme nt. This trump is about the conquest of illusion through connecting with t he inner self -- inner conviction -- a vision quest. THE CHARIOT symbolizes control over the ten sion of opposites, and that is also the nature of meditation, a suspension of the dual ity and polarization that characterize outer life. The corresponding Hebrew let ter is Cheth, which means 'fence.' Meditation is the fence around the crop of our contemplati ve efforts. Like THE CHARIOT, the personality is a vehicle for cosmic forces which op erate within us largely at the subconscious level. This trump represents the power of ast ral projection and attraction. When we meditate, we may be physically in our rooms, but mentally far, f ar away; or, perhaps our imagination brings strong images of another to us. Meditation is simply becoming aware of these patterns, then moving past them to the depth where the still center appears as the Void or the \"I AM.\" The Chariot is about settin g forth on the journey of spiritual development. In Hebrew, the word for Chariot is merkabah , and it is associated with a form of mysticism. In throne mysticism, the aspirant is absorbed in visual contemplation of the Throne-Chariot of God. Hestia was originally one of the twelve Olympians. She was the first-born ch ild of Cronos and Rhea, and the first to be swallowed up again when Cronos realized he wou ld be overthrown by one of his offspring. Hestia is such a gracious and pliant goddess t hat when Zeus wanted to make room on Olympus for the arrival of Dionysus, she gave up her pl ace among the divine dozen. Apparently she did not mind being displaced si nce she carries \"the center\" within herself. She has a sense of direction, of purpos e inside. Her personality is typically humble, letting life find unobstructe d manifestation through her. Her mytheme is renunciation. Her mandate is seva, or service. She is s elf-controlled, self-disciplined. She is the quiet type, but her unuttered spee ch contains the power of silence and secrecy which comes from the control of language. It increas es receptivity. She is a self-sufficient individual who derives her sense of self w orth from within, as shown by her perpetual maidenhood. This Virgin Goddess is a variation on the archetypal theme of the Holy Grail. He stia is the virgin goddess of the hearth and its fire, as well as protectress of the home and of the state. She \"keeps the home fires burning,\" as goddess of hearth and home. Her attr ibutes include Intuitiveness; Female energy; Receiving information from within. Hestia as the goddess of home and hearth, represented the ideal of purity in these areas. Possibly for this reason she was an eternal virgin, deliberately remaining aloof from the advances of the male gods. It is important to note, however, that both Poseidon and Apollo sought to court her, but she refused them. Indeed, it is also worth mention ing that in Greek mythology, Hestia, along with Athena and Artemis, were the only goddesses who we re immune to the passions aroused by Aphrodite. Despite her importance i n Greek religion,"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"Hestia is not well represented in either mythology or art. Be that as it m ay, the goddess received her share of honors, including a Homeric Hymn. \" Hestia, you who tend the sacred dwelling of the far-shooting lord, Apollo, at holy Pyth o, from your tresses flowing oil ever drips down. Come to this house! Come in gent le spirit with resourceful Zeus and grant grace to my song! \" Her sacred fire was moved from Greece to Rome by Aeneas who was from Troy. Th e tendency of fire is to transmute a material substance into a more raref ied form. This is also true of spiritual fire; it means the dominion of the spirit over form. Whe n we can observe what is unworthy in ourselves, this fire purges us of corruption. In her temple in the Roman Forum, six vestal virgins watched by day and by n ight to assure that the sacred fire did not die out. These virgins, consecrated to V esta (Hestia), maintained the sacred fire or perpetual flame which was kept burn ing on her altar. Psychologically, this initiation meant that the temptations of the physical w orld were surmounted. The six vestal virgins entered the service of the goddess around the ages of si x to ten years old. Their term of active service lasted thirty years. After that they wer e permitted to marry, though few did since they were instilled with the virtues of t his goddess. They received great honor and had very important public privileges. Their persons were considered inviolable, and woe to the vestal found guilty of unchastity. If he r spotless chastity were not maintained, she would be immediately killed along w ith her lover. PHYSICAL FORM Hestia is the goddess of the hearth. She is also known as Vesta (Roman). Alth ough an important deity in Greek religion, she is rarely depicted in art, and has vi rtually no mythology and iconography. Hestia, being the first to be swallowed, was the last to be disgorged, and so was at once the first and latest born of the children of Cr onos. In the high dwellings of all, both deathless gods and men who walk on earth, you have gained an everlasting abode and highest honor: glorious is your portion and your right. For wit hout you mortals hold no banquet, --where one does not duly pour sweet wine in off ering to Hestia both first and last. The self-sufficient goddesses, Artemis, Athena, and Hestia were kn own in antiquity as the virgin goddesses. None of them ever married or had children. For a modern woman, these archetypes do not denote a physical status or age, but a state of mind. Emotionally, sh e is self-contained, needing only her own approval. While the self-suffici ent woman may eagerly welcome company and truly enjoy being a wife and a mother, she also find s contentment in solitude. These three archetypes are often describ ed as independent and strong. Some women's jobs require years of formal education or take them to an office everyday. Other women work from the heart or from the home. Hestia is the goddess of sacred wisdom and the hearth. Known as Vesta to the Romans, she was the patroness of the Vestal Virgins, who guarded the sacred flame of Rome and the prophetic writings of the Sibyl. In myth, Hestia is the wise woman of the village, the priestess or seeress in the temple, the"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"witch of the forest. She is the crone aspect of the triple Goddess, no lon ger beholden to parent, husband, or child, but belonging only to herself and to the tribe. An ancient woman of mystery and hidden knowledge, she guards crystals which have a power older and greater than Immortals. No matter if the walls of her castl e are upright or crumbled, her inner serenity is her strength, and to those who are troubl ed, she offers a refuge. She also guards ancient secrets and possesses magical powers; ol der characters embody the dignity of the wise and aged woman, something we have tragically lost sigh t of in the modern world. The three virgin goddesses are archetypes of women and their work: the Warri or Caste, the Worker Caste, and the Religious Caste. But no man is an island, and in this, women are the same as men. Women have jobs, and women also have families, and a large part of women's lives is influenced by the people they know. Hestia is more str aightforward. She is also a virgin, but unlike Athena and Artemis, she never had any consorts or sexual relationships. She is thought of as a living flame, associated with stability, permanence, pr osperity and the hearth. She is depicted as an austere, fully robed mature woman. The re are few stories about her myth but she obviously displays all the virtues of the Greek wif e. There is duality, developed during patriarchal times, between the feminine home -world or Hestia and the masculine public-world or Agora. Increasingly the Agora has been consi dered the only \"important\" world, but in fact until recently most of human life, inc luding education, entertainment and work centred on the Hestia. We are the physical focal point of all the generations who have gone before us--and all those who will follow us, as our progeny. This focusing of life force th rough the family is a physical representation of the Holy Grail -- the container of the manifes tation of the divine. Another aspect of Hestia in the physical world is shown in the patterns in the structure of matter. Hestia is characterized as being immobile or in repose. Her balanc ed personality and equanimity reflect the characteristic of equilibrium. Dynami c equilibrium may also be expressed in living systems as homeostasis. In physics, the structure of matter can be expressed mathematically. T he condition of most- economical maximal stability is expressed in the geometrical form know n as Vector Equilibrium. It underlies the structure of the atomic nucleus of all atoms, therefore all matter. It is the blueprint for the stabilization of matter from noth ingness. Vector Equilibrium is produced by connecting the centers of twelve circles clustered around one, also known as closest-packed spheres. This condition of maximal e quilibration forms the basis for the way energy travels within the nuclei of atoms, and is th erefore a very fundamental principle in the construction of the universe. Curiously, this particular geometry is described in an ancient Hebre w text known as the SEPHIR YETZIRAH , or THE BOOK OF FORMATION. To the ancient Hebrew mystics, it was known as the Throne Chariot of Fire. It linked the manifest with th e archetypal world. Its geometrical form was used in a meditation practice. It was a vehicle for m oving consciousness from one plane to the next. Vector Equilibrium repres ents the balancing of"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"opposite factors. The Tarot Trump VII, THE CHARIOT depicts this vision o f a divine Chariot. The concept of balancing opposites is carried further by the fact that th is card with its fiery symbolism is attributed to the astrological sign Cancer, a water sign. This plac es or locates it in the domestic realm of hearth and home. It also links Hestia with the vi rginal qualities of the moon(Cancer is ruled by the moon). This path on the Tree of Life leads from Binah to Geburah, showing the inf luence of the Supernals descending through \"the veil of Water (which is blood) upon the energy of man\" and so inspiring it. On the Path of Return, this is one of the few paths wh ich spans the great Void, known as The Abyss. Since Hestia was the first-born of Cronos and Rhea--time and corporeal mat ter--she might be seen as that heat produced as a by-product of the creation. She is an expr ession of entropy. In the spectrum linking microcosm to macrocosm, she is the ce ntral fire in the warm-blooded human body, the home (the hearth), and the molten magma at the center of planet Earth. Even the fire in the center of the Sun is analogous to these, inasmuch as i t occupies a specific locus in space and time, and therefore shares its origin (if not its form) with them. These central fires warm and nourish and promote growth. It is intimate ly linked to the survival of the human species. Without our warm blood, we would never have deve loped our higher faculties. It was a classical practice for the first and last tribute at any ritual to be of fered to Hestia. She is truly the beginning and end for human consciousness. Without her r eceptive, containing 'space' there is no resting place for the atoms of the human body i n the universe. I. Miller recounts the brain centers which are responsive during pr ayer and meditation in \"Neurotheology 101\" (2001). \"Brain scans of a large sampling of people lost in prayer or deep meditation r eveal certain common neurological underpinnings which correlate with religious st ates from transcendence, to visions, to enlightenment and feelings of awe. Attent ion in the frontal lobe is indicated by activation in this area of the brain during meditation. Whe n the parietal lobes quiet down, a person feels an expansive oneness with the uni verse or cosmic unity. For a mystical experience to occur, brain regions that orient us in s pace and mark the distinction between self and world must go quiet. In order to feel that time, fear and self-consciousness have dissolved, cer tain brain circuits must be interrupted. Which ones? Activity in the amygdala, which monitors the environment for threats and registers fear, must be damped. Parietal-l obe circuits, which orient you in space and mark the sharp distinction between self and world, must go quiet. The orientation area requires sensory input to do its calculations. Inten se meditation blocks the brain from forming a distinction between self and world. Frontal- and temporal-lobe circuits, which mark time and generate sel f-awareness, must disengage. When this happen what we think of as our 'higher' functions of self hood appear briefly to drop out, dissolve, or be deleted from consciousness."},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Our response to religious words is mediated at the juncture of three l obes (parietal, frontal and temporal) and governs reaction to language. The \"voice of God\" probably emanates from electrical activity in the temporal lobes, important to speech perce ption. Inner speech is interpreted as originating outside the self. Broca's area, responsible for speech production switches on. Stress can influence one's ability to determi ne origin of a voice. The right anterior cingulate turns on whether a stimulus originates in the environment or is an auditory hallucination. Hyperarousal by sensory stimuli, such as drumming, dancing or incantations, can am plify emotions and send the system into hyperdrive. The equilibrium of the h ippocampus is overwritten, inhibiting the flow of signals between neurons. Certai n regions are then deprived of neuronal inputs. When the orientation center is isolated wi th ritual and liturgy or meditation, the boundaries of the self begin to dissolve. Sacred images are generated by the lower temporal which also responds to rit ual imagery and is facilitated by prayer and meditation. Religious emotions originate fr om the middle temporal lobe and are linked to emotional aspects of religious experience, s uch as joy and awe. Yet neural correlates don't mean that these experiences exist \"onl y\" in the brain or are merely illusory; they are associated with distinct neural activity. Th ere is no way to distinguish if the brain causes these experiences, or is actually per ceiving spiritual reality. There are a wide variety of theories and mechanisms presented as influe ntial spiritual transducers. Many of these biological systems work together in a variety of ways to c reate different experiences from deep meditation, to ecstatic trance, N ear Death Experiences (NDEs) to Cosmic Consciousness. Cosmic Unity and a sense of Eternity (sacr ed or cosmic time) occurs when the parietal lobe quiets down; self-identity vanis hes or expands to universal proportions. When the orientation area is deprived of neuronal inp ut by gating from the hippocampus, sense of self expands. The role of suspension of sense of orientation in 3 or 4 dimensions of spaceti me is interesting in terms of the prevalance of systems of sacred geometry in mys ticism to facilitate gestalt experiences. There are many ritualistic and meditat ional devices from Mandalas or Yantras, to Middle Pillar Exercise and the Diamond Body, to Merkabah mysticism which promote inner plane orientation. In parapsychology, such d evises are known as Psychotronics and function as \"time machines.\" This could i mply that focusing or intense concentration on these internally-generated signals for orie nting in sacred spacetime creates a paradoxical rebound which we feel as dissolving int o cosmic consciousness, where beginning and end are cotemporaneous. This may be why meditators are urged to remain motionless to achieved the de sired state. Mystics say that if you move during meditation, the attention will be drawn back down into the body and worldly attachment. W hen there is no movement there is no external reference signal to orient in 3-space and no reason for this portion of the br ain to activate. Intensive meditation can over-drive certain other brain areas and seemingl y transport us to another universe. And just as, in terms of symmetry principles, a complet e description of the Universe contains no information that serves to define a preferred position or direction in space, the local self dissolves in an omnidirectional expansion."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Sacred images are generated in the lower temporal lobe which also responds to ritualistic use of imagery and iconography.

Occupations and preoccupations of Hestia include, agoraphobic Amish baker butler cook dietician domestic servant genealogist housewife househusband homeowner humanist humanitarian laundress nutritionist Quaker sevadar spinster volunteer waitress EMOTIONAL IMAGE One of the three virgin goddess on Mt. Olympus, Hestia vowed to her brother Ze us that she would remain a virgin forever in a symbolic gesture of spiritual purity and int egrity. Modern Hestia women can find romantic happiness with Apollo and Hermes. B ecause they do not crave attention, are most content at home and enjoy a simple life, Apollo m en are their best match. They are attracted to women who are steady and balanced, and als o like to be in control of the relationship. That's okay with Hestia, as long as she has a beautiful, peaceful home to maintain and inhabit. Apollo men will gladly provide he r with this, as they are not only successful but also take after the god of architecture, sym metry and balance. Apollonian men and Hestian women are both at home with themselve s, which offers great strength and stability in their pairing. Meet a Hermes man and you will find that he can bring great joy to your life. He rmes men are childlike and lighthearted, two qualities that will help Hestia es cape her more serious side. She is very much like Vesta, a virgin fire goddess of Rome. Her fire is con cealed within her body; much like the fertility of Earth is concealed within the frozen ground of winter. Vesta is based on the Greek goddess Hestia, who does a fine job of rep resenting this moon. Myth tells us Vesta was given a choice of marriage between Apollo and Neptune b ut refused both. Zeus then granted her freedom. Vesta's temples are r ound with a central sacred fire; this fire was tended and maintained by young female initiate s called vestals. These girls kept the eternal fame of the temples burning. The vestal vi rgins went through three phases of service; first, that of student, then as priestess, and finally as teacher. Vestals were by no means celibate, though their career as a vestal often end ed when they had their first child."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Hestia helps us lead a balanced life by providing a sense of center. The h oly precinct makes communication with the divine forces possible. Thus we can harmoniz e inner and outer reality through her power. She was rarely personified in human form. Rather, her image is architectu ral; she is the hearth itself with the structure surrounding it and protecting it, al so. Hestia provides places, nexus points and spatiality. She gives us gathering places, power places , and dwelling places. We might think of her calming energy when we \"can't sett le down.\" She is important psychologically because without her we couldn't focus on an im age. She is not personified, therefore, but is the \"place\" where personifying occurs . Stability of the inner self, or a sense of belonging are Hestian. As the godde ss of locality, Hestia reminds us of the sacred nature of being rooted in a particular area and nation. The yearning to seek out our \"roots,\" and the resurgence in nationalism and patrioti sm all show the relationship between psyche and geography. Every area has its natives or r egional souls who are adapted for survival in the climatic conditions and prevailing c ultural values. It is not possible to come to a universal citizenship without giving due r espect to our genetic inheritance. Hestia provides the focal point at the center of the world; and on a personal level we all tend to feel that we are the centers of our own special perspective on re ality. We are each the center of our own Universe--and our consciousness projects that visi on of the universe outward. When that projection \"comes home to rest\" we experience that re absorption as the pure void, ground state of our being. She is the sanctuary at the center, the holy ground, the magick circle. On an e ven deeper level, Hestia represents an archetypal image of the Self. This is repre sented in Crowley's Thoth Tarot on Trump VII as the circular image of the Holy Grail. This mandala sym bol, or sacred circle, depicts a state of harmony, wholeness, and integration, much l ike the native American medicine wheel. It contains \"blood,\" that which is s imultaneously fire and water, a paradoxical union of opposites. Hestia thus shows herself as a central aspect of psychic life--that of c oncentrating or focusing of one's energies. The concentrating of individual energies is s hown by her virginal nature, which she shares with Athena and Artemis. It is a positi ve form of being self-centered.

Holism is a healthy respect for the connectedness of things, the deep ecology of life and matter -- the realization that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts -- the sea mless mind body connection, the identity of psyche and substance. It is the counterpoin t to atomistic reductionism, to postmodern de-construction. In Science holism is t he belief that complex systems may be understood only when viewed in their entirety. The view t hat parts of a system have significance mostly in virtue of their interrelations wit h other parts. The concept of holism is at the center of far-reaching changes in various are as of philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. Holism in epistemology and t he philosophy of mind is widespread among analytic philosophers subsequen t to the work of the later Wittgenstein and to Quine's \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\". Roughl y speaking, the claim is that (a) for a person to have beliefs, a social, linguistic commu nity is required and that (b) single beliefs have a meaning only within a whole system of beli efs. Furthermore, holism is discussed as an option in science, in particu lar in the interpretation of quantum physics. Opting for holism in any of these areas has considerable consequences for ou r philosophical view of the world and ourselves. Holism in quantum physic s is said to refute atomism, which has been predominant in modern philosophy of nature. Hol ism in epistemology and the philosophy of mind is seen as an alternative to what is know n as the Cartesian tradition, which dominated modern thought down to logical empi ricism. A good deal of research work has been done on holism in each of the mentioned areas. B ut there is as yet no research work that provides a critical overview of holism in general . That is to say: we lack research work that focuses on a general conception of holism, enqu ires into possible connections between different forms of holism, and evaluates t he significance of such connections for contemporary philosophy. Holism as an idea or philosophical concept is diametrically opposed to atomism . Where the atomist believes that any whole can be broken down or analyzed into its separat e parts and the relationships between them, the holist maintains that the whol e is primary and often greater than the sum of its parts. The atomist divides things up in order to know them better; the holist looks at things or systems in aggregate and argues that we can k now more about them viewed as such, and better understand their nature and thei r purpose."},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"The early Greek atomism of Leucippus and Democritus (fifth centur y B.C.) was a forerunner of classical physics. According to their view, everything in th e universe consists of indivisible, indestructible atoms of various kinds. Change is a rearran gement of these atoms. This kind of thinking was a reaction to the still earlier holism of P armenides, who argued that at some primary level the world is a changeless unity. According t o him, \"All is One. Nor is it divisible, wherefore it is wholly continuous.... It is comple te on every side like the mass of a rounded sphere.\" In the seventeenth century, at the same time that classical physics gave renewed emphasis to atomism and reductionism, Spinoza developed a holistic philosophy remi niscent of Parmenides. According to Spinoza, all the differences and apparent divisi ons we see in the world are really only aspects of an underlying single substance, which he cal led God or nature. Based on pantheistic religious experience, this emphasis on an u nderlying unity is reflected in the mystical thinking of most major spiritual tradition s. It also reflects developments in modern quantum field theory, which describes all e xistence as an excitation of the underlying quantum vacuum, as though all existing things we re like ripples on a universal pond. Hegel, too, had mystical visions of the unity of all things, on which he based h is own holistic philosophy of nature and the state. Nature consists of one timeless, unif ied, rational and spiritual reality. Hegel's state is a quasi-mystical collective, an \"invisi ble and higher reality,\" from which participating individuals derive their authent ic identity, and to which they owe their loyalty and obedience. All modern collectivist political thi nkers - including, of course, Karl Marx - stress some higher collective reality, the unity, the whole, the group, though nearly always at the cost of minimizing the importance of differenc e, the part, the individual. Against individualism, all emphasize the social whole or social f orces that somehow possess a character and have a will of their own, over and above the characte rs and wills of individual members. The twentieth century has seen a tentative movement toward holism in s uch diverse areas as politics, social thinking, psychology, management theory, and medicine. These have included the practical application of Marx's thinking in Communist an d Socialist states, experiments in collective living, the rise of Gestalt psychology, systems t heory, and concern with the whole person in alternative medicine. All these have been reactions against excessive individualism with its attendant alienation and fragmentati on, and exhibit a commonsense appreciation of human beings' interdependency with one another and with the environment. Where atomism was apparently legitimized by the sweeping sucesses of cl assical physics, holism found no such foundation in the hard sciences. It remained a c hange of emphasis rather than a new philosophical position. There were attempts to found it on the idea of organism in biology - the emergence of biological form and the cooperative relation between biological and ecological systems - but these, too, were ultimatel y reducible to simpler parts, their properties, and the relation between them. Even systems theory, although it emphasizes the complexity of aggregates, does so in terms of causal feedback loops between various constituent parts. It is only with quantum theory an d the dependence of the very being or identity of quantum entities upon thei r contexts and relationships that a genuinely new, \"deep\" holism emerges."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"In an online debate, sponsored by Journal of Consciousness Studies , in \"Faster than Thought: Holism, Homogeneity and Temporal Coding,\" Thomas Metzinger, offers his chapter taken from the collection Conscious Experience . The space of consciousness is the space of subjective experience. Sinc e this is the space in which the world and we ourselves appear to ourselves on an experiential le vel, I will also call it the phenomenal space. Many people believe that our phenomenal space i s also a representational space: In this space we represent a part of the worl d and of ourselves to ourselves. The phenomenal representata, i.e. the vehicles of represent ation bearing subjective content, I will henceforth call 'mental models', without trying to explicate this concept further at this point. [1] Our conscious space - this is the basic idea - consists of mental mode ls which are often embedded in each other. The largest of the mental models active in this s pace is our conscious 'model of reality' or 'model of the world'. This phenomenal model of the world contains all the other conscious mental models and its content is ide ntical with the overall content of our conscious space. But since we are beings who almost constantly fail to recognize our mental m odels as models,[2] our phenomenal space is characterized by an all-embracing naive realism, which we are incapable of transcending in standard situations. In this way, the totality of mental contents which fill this space form a structure that can be des cribed from the external perspective of science as a self-referentially opaque phenome nal model of the world. From the internal perspective of the system activating this model, howe ver, this structure is quite simply subjectively experienced reality: the only reality existi ng for this system. One of the main challenges for any naturalistic theory of mind is that of providing us with a clear account of this transition: How does a model become this reality? A lthough I am not able to dissolve the highest-order wholeness of reality or of myself simply b y a reversible act of will, I am perfectly able to perceive or even actively generate lower- order phenomenal wholes within the space which is held together by this high est-order property. Perhaps this holistic character of reality, which is stronger than mere numerical identity and which cannot be transcended experientially, could be described as phenomenal coherence: Our conscious experience of reality is held together int ernally by a principle or a mechanism, which itself is subjectively inaccessible. This cohere nce of my reality has nothing to do with the concept of coherence in physics or logic. Rather, it i s responsible for a succinct phenomenal holism, which we ought to take into account on the con ceptual level. Although a world made out of discrete, building block-like elements co uld well be a unity, it could never be a whole. But my world is not a toy world composed of little build ing blocks: it is also a living reality whose parts interact in a quasi-organic way (i n the sense of the German concept Erleben). This concretely experienced unity of a d iversity is accompanied by a multitude of dynamic part/whole relations. Thus, the addi tional phenomenological aspect of holism or wholeness which goes beyond mere unity r esults from the fact that the parts constituting the phenomenal model of realit y are not elements, but parts of this reality. For this reason, if we want to understand the h olistic character of"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"our phenomenal world, we will have to take its multi-levelled structu re as the starting point of our investigation. Another aspect is important in order to understand what else can be me ant by 'wholeness'. Although this aspect is not at the centre of my discussion, we will r epeatedly encounter it whenever we ask ourselves how a model can turn into a reality which is phenome nally present.[7] This second aspect consists in the fact that the experie ntial contents appearing in our conscious space are joined together into a holistic entity of the hi ghest order, something we might call a global Gestalt, by spatial neighbouring relations and es pecially by temporal identity within an experienced present, i.e. by subjective s imultaneity, by being given within a single psychological moment. This global Gestalt quality is nec essary for the whole to become a reality. The whole is always given to us in a single psychological moment, that is to s ay in the experienced present of a subjective Now. The phenomenal presence of th e whole springs from this 'now', i.e. from the temporal identity of a diversity of experien tial contents. What does this mean? It means that the holistic diversity of phenomenal conte nts becomes a coherent reality because there is an elementary 'window of presenc e'. One thing cannot be doubted from the first-person perspective: I always experience the wholeness of reality now. This yields a first phenomenological concept of conscious experience: Conscious experience is the phenomenal presence of an all-embracing whole. There is also mental holism, and semantic holism. (Following discussion forthcoming in The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy ): Mental (or semantic) holism is the doctrine that the identity of a belie f content (or the meaning of a sentence that expresses it) is determined by its place in t he web of beliefs or sentences comprising a whole theory or group of theories. It can be contrast ed with two other views: atomism and molecularism. Molecularism characterizes meaning and content in terms of relatively small parts of the web in a way that allows many differen t theories to share those parts. For example, the meaning of 'chase' might be said by a mole cularist to be try to catch. Atomism characterizes meaning and content in terms of none of the web; it says that sentences and beliefs have meaning or content independently of their relations to other sentences or beliefs. One major motivation for holism has come from reflections on the natur es of confirmation and learning. As Quine (1953) observed, claims about the world are confirmed n ot individually, but only in conjunction with theories of which they are a part. A nd typically, one cannot come to understand scientific claims without understand ing a significant chunk of the theory of which they are a part. For example, in learning the Newtonian c oncepts of 'force', 'mass', kinetic energy' and 'momentum', one doesn't learn any de finitions of these terms in terms that are understood beforehand, for there are no such d efinitions. Rather, these theoretical terms were all learned together in conjunction wi th procedures for solving problems. The major problem with holism is that it threatens to make generaliza tion in psychology virtually impossible. If the content of any state depends on all others, it wou ld be extremely unlikely that any two believers would ever share a state with the same conten t. Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"holism would appear to conflict with our ordinary conception of reasoning. Wh at sentences one accepts influence what one infers. If I accept a sentence and then later reject it, I thereby change the inferential role of that sentence. So the meaning of w hat I accept wouldn't be the same as what I later reject. But then it would be diffic ult to understand on this view how one could rationally --or even irrationally!-- change one's mind . Agreement and translation are also problematic for much the same reason. Holists have re sponded (1) by proposing that we should think not in terms of \"same/different\" me aning but in terms of a gradient of similarity of meaning, (2) by proposing \"two factor\" theories or ( 3) by simply accepting the consequence that there is no real difference between changing meanings and changing beliefs. Any particular type of holistic state will exist only rarely and transientl y. In this respect, holistic mental states are like the states of computers. A total comp uter configuration as specified by the contents of every register in the internal memory and every cell on the hard disk will occur only rarely and transiently. There are determinist ic laws of the evolution of total computer states, but they deal with such transient state s. So psychological explanation will have to be seen by holists as like explanation of what comput ers do, in part a matter of fine grained laws of the evolution of systems, in part coarse-grain ed accounts of how the systems work that do not have the status of laws. It has sometimes been suggested that quantum phenomena exhibit a charact eristic holism or nonseparability, and that this distinguishes quantum from classical physics. One puzzling quantum phenomenon arises when one performs measurements of spin or polarization on certain separated quantum systems. The results of these measurements exhibit patterns of statistical correlation that resist traditional caus al explanation. Some have held that it is possible to understand these patterns as instan ces or consequences of quantum holism or nonseparability. Just what holism and nonseparability ar e supposed to be has not always been made clear, though, and each of these notions has bee n understood in different ways. Moreover, while some have taken holism and nons eparability to come to the same thing, others have thought it important to distinguish t he two. Any evaluation of the significance of quantum holism and/or nonseparability mu st rest on a careful analysis of these notions. Holism has often been taken as the thesis that the whole is more than the s um of its parts. Several different interpretations of this epigram prove relevant to phys ics, as we shall see. Here is a correspondingly vague initial statement of nonseparability: The state of the whole is not constituted by states of its parts. It is already apparent both that hol ism and nonseparability are related notions and that their exact relation needs to b e clarified. In one interpretation, holism is a methodological thesis, to the effect th at the best way to study the behavior of a complex system is to treat it as a whole, and not merely to analyze the structure and behavior of its component parts. Alternatively, holism m ay be taken as a metaphysical thesis: There are some wholes whose natures are simply not determined by the nature of their parts. Methodological holism stands opposed to methodologic al reductionism, in physics as well as in other sciences. But it is a certai n variety of metaphysical holism that is more closely related to nonseparability. What is at issue here is the extent to which the properties of the whole are determined by th e properties of its"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"parts: property holism denies such determination, and thereby comes very close to a thesis of nonseparability. By and large, a system in classical physics can be analyzed into parts, whose state s and properties determine those of the whole they compose. But the state of a s ystem in quantum mechanics resists such analysis. The quantum state of a system gives a spe cification of it’s probabilistic dispositions to display various properties on measurem ent. Quantum theory’s most complete such specification is given by what is called a pure state . Even when a compound system has a pure state, some of its subsystems may not have t heir own pure states. Emphasizing this characteristic of quantum mechan ics, Schrödinger described such component subsystems as \"entangled\". Superficiall y, such entanglement of systems already demonstrates nonseparability. At a deeper level, it has been maintained that the puzzling statistics that arise from measurements on entangl ed quantum systems either demonstrate, or are explicable in terms of, holism or nonsepara bility rather than any problematic action at a distance. As applied to physics, ontological holism is the thesis that there are ph ysical objects that are not wholly composed of basic physical parts. Views of Bohr, Bohm and others may be interpreted as endorsing some version of this thesis. In no case is it cla imed that any physical object has nonphysical parts. The idea is rather that some physical entities that we take to be wholly composed of a particular set of basic physical parts are in fact not so composed. It was Bohr’s (1934) view that one can meaningfully ascribe properties such as position or momentum to a quantum system only in the context of some well-defined exp erimental arrangement suitable for measuring the corresponding property. He used the expression ‘quantum phenomenon’ to describe what happens in such an arrangement. In his view, then, although a quantum phenomenon is purely physical, it is not composed of distinct happenings involving independently characterizable physical objects- -the quantum system on the one hand, and the classical apparatus on the other. And even if the quant um system may be taken to exist outside the context of a quantum phenomenon, little or n othing can then be meaningfully said about its properties. It would therefore be a mistake to consider a quantum object to be an independently existing component part of the appar atus-object whole. Bohm’s (1980, 1993) reflections on quantum mechanics lead him to adopt a more gener al holism. He believed that not just quantum object and apparatus, but any coll ection of quantum objects by themselves, constitute an indivisible whole. This may be made precise in the context of Bohm’s (1952) interpretation of quantum mechanics by not ing that a complete specification of the state of the \"undivided universe\" r equires not only a listing of all its constituent particles and their positions, but also of a field as sociated with the wave- function that guides their trajectories. If one assumes that the basi c physical parts of the universe are just the particles it contains, then this establishe s ontological holism in the context of Bohm’s interpretation. Holism is ecological in essence: Holism is an attempt at synthesis, rather than system of pphilosophy, per se. It doesn't challenge religion, but provides a worldvi ew for preserving"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"this unique creation. Nature displays obvious interdependence expr essed as recipricity between long-assicated organisms, both plant and animal. (Smuts, 1952). Holism in Co-evolution means \"Life forms are selected for, that have a comm on behavioural and physical characteristic; that is they conform to a COMMON P RINCIPLE defined by our material universe.\" This is the principle of compatib ility, which leads one to a holistic conception, and is reflected in a behavioural strategy of the animal that ensures its perpetuation (survival). Smuts recognised in the discoveries of the New Physics of 1926, an important HO LISTIC principle: \"the structural character of matter indicates that it i s also creative, not of its own stuff, but of the forms, (chemical) arrangements, and patterns which con stitute all its value in the physical sphere Holism is sourced in the very nature of the eleme nts. Smuts recognises what all religions call for: \"how important a part moral discipl ine plays in the furtherance of the evolutionary holistic scheme.\" Holism influences o ur moral and ethical culture.\" Much of what Darwin said has the holistic signature. There are repeated e xamples of this. To use his own words, he uses the term \"struggle for existence\" in a \"me taphorical sense\" \"INCLUDING DEPENDENCE OF ONE BEING ON ANOTHER (equated partial ly with compatibility), and including not only the life of the individual, but su ccess in leaving progeny\" (equated with PERPETUITY). \"Therefore, as more individuals a re produced than can possibly survive, there must always be a struggle for existence (int eraction). Interactors he called \"enemies or COMPETITORS.\" \"Instead of the animistic, or the mechanistic, or the mathematical un iverse, we see the genetic, organic, holistic universe, in which the decline of the earlier physical patterns provides the opportunity for the emergence of the more advanced vital and r ational patterns\" (Smuts, 1952) Smuts sees the individual personality as central to Holism and as the most recent holistic expression that has emerged through evolution . He says, \"To me the holistic aspect of the universe is fundamental, and appears to be the key position both for the science and the philosophy of the future. Charles Darwin obser ved that if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree (coevolution) with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.\" In Holism, this l ast principle differs from competition in that while becoming \"modified and improved,\" inter actions are altered to reduce the effect of interactors upon one another.\" Darwin introduces three principles fundamental to Holism: [1] the idea of co-adaptations and \"complex co-adaptations of structure between one organic being and another , which we see everywhere throughout nature\" (coevolution) and [2] the idea that i nteractions are economic: \"natural selection is continually trying to ECONOMISE in eve ry part of the organisation.\" [3] The importance of interactions leads to the recognition that \"each new variety or species, during the progress of its formation, will generally pre ss hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them.\" A consequence of thi s interaction is the evolution of decreased interactions. \"The truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen u nder many circumstances.\" . . . \"Natural selection will not produce absolute perfe ction,\" but does lead to improved varieties surviving.\""},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"\"Holism simplifies life and causes a peaceful order. Natural select ion in the holistic model acts upon the individual\" . . . \" Adaptation, when between organisms that are both evolving, leads to what appears like group selection, but is coadaptation (in its many guises). Smuts' Holism presents another revolution that shall dawn u pon us. As the facts of the world-view of Holism unfold we should see immense changes in our d ealings with and understanding of nature. Holism will encompass every aspect of modern t echnology and require that we reform our association with nature and make our activitie s more benign.\" \"Holism opens the door to religion. In holism there is the possibility for the unification of the religious, evolutionary, scientific and materialistic approaches to lif e. Holism requires a revolutionary change in attitudes from all sides to fit each as part of a whole syst em. With personality as the ultimate holistic expression, as believed by Smuts, its influence must penetrate our souls and extend out to the smallest life form! Something holistic is at the heart of things and in the nature of this uni verse, which is not a mere chance or random assemblement of items. The detailed things d erive most of their meaning, significance and functioning from the whole of which they are but parts. They are not mere parts but really members of wholes. Both as a metaphysical and as a scien tific concept the whole is basic to an understanding of the world. And in sociol ogy and religion this is more clearly the case. Relativity is only a halfway house to this mor e fundamental concept\" (Smuts, 1952).\" A similar sentiment was expressed by Aldos Leop old, the American Environmentalist, \". . . the problem we face is the extension of th e social conscience from people to land. No important change in ethics was ever acco mplished without an internal change in our intellectual emphasis, loyalties, affe ctions, and convictions.\" It is Hestia who helps us focus, concentrate, and balance our thoughts. Just r ecall how soothing it can be to sit in front of a fireplace in a calm, reflective mood. L ike the other Virgins, Artemis and Athena, Hestia has her own style of illumination. Many t imes, without her, it would be impossible to perceive any images in the dept hs of our psyche. Therefore, she is a key to insight -- to grasping the whole picture. Focus, as a nexus point, creates heat and light in optics, as when we focus the s un's rays with a magnifying glass to start a fire. Not all of these images of burning and concen tration are positive. Hestia has her own forms of pathology, such as \"cabin fever,\" produc ed by long hours of isolation. Staying in one spot too long, we get \"stir-crazy,\" agoraphobi c, or depressed. Remember, Saturn is the father of Hestia. Depression wh ich leads to brooding can lead to a meditative place, if the depression is deepened rather than avoided, or manically denied by \"staying busy.\" Sometimes thoughts can burn with obsessive intensity. In some varie ties of obsessive/compulsive disorder, there is a cleaning mania. Yet, in order to e xpress wholeness, our Holy Grail must contain pathological aspects, the light and the dark fuel which feeds the fire. The idea of a sanitorium or healing center as a sanctuary fosters our ability t o re-center ourselves away from the hubbub of urban life. A \"center of activity\" migh t be seen in the"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"eye of a storm, a volcanic eruption, or a hot bed of political intrigue. All centers are not tranquil. That which lies in Hestia's center burns and smoulders. When we fe el \"burned-out\" we need to readjust our focus, and frequently a change of location, retreat, or visit to a favored power spot in nature helps rejuvenate us. Sometimes we feel a need to re move ourselves from the whirl of activity at the center. When homelife gets hectic with m any visitors and chores pile up, we long for a vacation. Or, if home is quiet, it can be our refuge, ou r soft cocoon to cushion us from the pressures of outer life. On the psychological level, since Hestia is among the first-born of gods, she i s a synthesis of their potencies, more fundamental than their later differentiati on. She represents the fiery power of the true Self. Her center is \"on fire\" with life energy, whi ch can manifest as volition, conscious and deliberate use of the will. True will comes from bringing the divine influences into an effective synthesis so that they come to a focal point wi thin ourselves. A receptive will means \"willingness\" to experience cosmic influ ences through the practice of reflective concentration of the mind. If we relax our bodies, and center our energies with one-pointed attention, we gain access to the fiery life-giving energy of the C osmos. This requires a quiet mind--an emptying of the mind--and reflects in a p ersonality which doesn't spend a lot of time in idle chatter. It indicates a psychological interiori ty or inwardness and inner creativity. Hestia renounces outer life in the greater world-at-l arge for a more fulfilling experience of her inner Self. On the mundane level, the woman possessed by Hestia thinks that a woman's place is in the home (yes, they still exist). She inherently senses the divinity at the core of the situation, but renounces or sacrifices the possibility of experiencing herself t hrough other gods in the field of archetypal manifestation. This natural attitude is often contaminated by cultural chauvinism. A m odern phenomenon, the househusband is coming to know Hestia in himself through the endless repetition of archetypal household chores. But they can be healing like th e Zen prescription to \"Chop wood; carry water.\" Many men find great peace in this lifestyle, whi ch they never found in the work-a-day world. This knowledge of Hestia as the ground of b eing creates a sense of inner space in the psychic domain. It is a very private for m of awareness- -the simple life. When attention is directed inward, there is little desire to be prais ed and lauded by society at large for our accomplishments. The solitude of household tasks is a spec ial reward which goes beyond the pleasure of craftwork, sewing, cooking, etc. What one loses in publ ic recognition is recaptured in the extra time available for introspection. On e develops a sense of self-sufficiency. With Hestia animating the background of household duties, there is a sense of dignity restored to this function which is too often seen as distasteful or men ial.

Hestia and Hermes represent the Greek imagination of motion and place. On the foot of the big statue of Zeus in Olympia, Phydias represented the twelve Olympian god s. Between Helios, the sun and Selene, the moon, he arranged them in six couples: Zeu s-Hera, Poseidon-Amphitrita, Hephaistos-Charis, Apollo-Artemis, Aphrodit e-Eros and Hermes- Hestia Hestia and Hermes are not husband and woman, nor brother and sister, nor mother and son either. They are neighbors, or better: friends. Where Hermes loiters is Hestia never far. Where Hestia stays, Hermes can appear at any moment. In its polarity, the couple Hestia- Hermes expresses the tension which is proper to the archaic rep resentation of space. Space needs a center, a fix point from which directions and orientations can be de fined. But space is also the locus of motion, and that implies the possibility of transitions, of passage from any point to any other. Hestia and Hermes belong to very archaic, pre-hellenistic representati ons. Hestia is the hearth. In modern Greek, istia still means the hearth or the household. Th e name Hermes comes from herma(x), hermaion or hermaios lophos, heap of stone. Before he bec ame an Olympian god, Hermes was the personification of lithoboly, the gesture of t hrowing stones on tombs. He was the heap of stone or the wooden pole on a grave, but also the phallos. Hermes unites death and fertility in one figure. Hestia and Hermes, personifications of the hearth and of the protecting grave are the gods of the domestic domain. They are also the symbols of the gestures of women an d men and of their interplay. Through that interplay, the house becomes a unique plac e in the world, a topos in a cosmos. Hestia and Hermes allow us a glance into Greek domesticity. In their interplay, we can understand something of the Greek household and its work s and of hospitality. You live both on the superficy of the soil, in the beautiful dwellings pl aces of men and women, and you are filled with mutual philía\", said a Homeric Hymn. Hestia an d Hermes are the epichthonian gods, the gods of the dwelled soil. They are everywhere w here people make fire, trace limits, build walls and a roof over their heads. Together, t hey are the gods of orientation and of the tracing of limits.

Her job was extremely important in ancient times sinc e rekindling a fire could be a difficult task. As a stay-at-home virgin, Hestia was perfect for the job, since an unmarried sister had few other commitments in the outside world. Hestia therefore stayed at t he sacred hearth on Mt. Olympus, even though she donated her throne to Dionysus. She was much l ike the fabled Cinderella, in that she stayed calmly behind while the others w ent about their business. Cinderella got her prince; Hestia gets her Self, her whole ness. We might call Hestia's quiet reflectiveness \"the yoga of contentment.\" Wh en our desires are simple and we have the spiritual capacity to be thankful for what we do h ave, it makes it easier to truly \"be in the now.\" Otherwise we yearn for bygone times, or some idealized future when supposedly everything will be \"right\" or \"better\" or \"f ixed\". The now has to be at least OK for our consciousness to be there, and truly inhabit that plac e. Otherwise it flits off in imaginal flights of fancy to another time and place. Hestia might be conceived of an \"existential\" goddess--one who accept s the human condition, and supports the state of consciousness that is neither ridd led with toxic shame nor grandiose fantasies. These notions promote subhuman and superhuman at titudes, but Hestia is that union of opposites. By being most fully human, she expresses an inherently divine quality wi thin that form of being. She doesn't mood alter by pumping up her expectations or sink int o an escapist depression. She sticks in the moment, which is a very spiritual posit ion from which to operate--it is the place of balance and stability which has its own form of momentum in terms of driving consciousness. She accepts life on its own terms, and fin ds contentment, fulfillment, and wholeness within what is given in the moment. She i s at home in the Void. The conjunction of the card the Chariot and Hestia's meditation corresp onds here with Merkaba mysticism --- meditation on the Chariot or Throne-Chariot of God . The mystics achieved a vision of this geometrical figure through meditation practice. T his geometry was a 4-dimensional array of the holy letters on an octahedron within a cube; its geo metrical reciprocal or dual is called Vector Equilibrium by Buckminster F uller. The Throne-Chariot is a geometrical picture of the creation or formation of the universe-- an omniradiant event that continues to happen. Those who engaged in this medi tation form were known as Merkaba visionaries. They sought ecstatic direct visionary expe rience of the Throne Chariot of God, yet stopped short of any kind of mystical union with the radiant form they encountered. "},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"The Merkaba (pronounced with equal stress on each syllable. MER-KA-BA) is the activation of the \"lightbody\" vehicle. Everybody has various energy fields around th eir body. Merkaba activation techniques use intention to create a vehicle based on a sacred geometry design for a variety of purposes. The main purpose is to bring you to highe r states of consciousness and awareness to fully embody the energy of uncondit ional love. Unconditional love is not an emotion, but a state of being. In Hebrew mysticism, the merkabah , or merkava , was the chariot/throne of light that Elijah ascended into heaven. It was described as a \"whirlwind of fire.\" Inter estingly enough, the Hebrew word for \"whirlwind is purposely \"misspelled\" in this s tory, and preserved in many copies, when compared to other Hebrew references to whirlwinds. Wh at was so special about this whirlwind? The Hebrew letters that spell the w ord Merkaba are Mem- Resh-Caph-Beth, from the root word Resh-Caph-Beth, meaning \"to ride.\" The root word is the same as the root word for \"cherub\" a form of angel, for angels were b elieved to have these chariots of light to travel dimensions. The Talmud (A Hebrew holy text) mentions the Merkaba in reference to Prince Jud ah who forbade mention of it in the text of the Mishnah . Many of these mystical teachings were shrouded in secrecy at the time, and many were told casual practice of such t echniques would lead to madness or death. Later, the Kaballah itself was restricte d to only married men over the age of forty. Merkaba mysticism was thought to be a form of astral travel, or total body travel. Eli jah was said to \"ascend\" to heaven, body and all, and never die. The exact techniqu es the ancient mystics used are unknown, though many assume it to combine praye r, meditation and some form of yogic posturing. Currently, many believe to have recovered the techniques through channeled sources, such as the Keys of Enoch by J.J. Hurtak. There is some extant literature concerning Merkabah Mysticism in add itoin to the SEPHIR YETZIRAH . The most important of these works are the Greater Hekhaloth and the Less er Hekhaloth. Rabbinical commentary concerning the secrets of the Thron e Chariot also exists. The majority of these works were not designed for practical use by m ystics. They described characteristic stages on the path to the vision of the Throne Ch ariot. They contain speculation rather than explicit instructions. It is possible, however, to deduce certain requirements and proceedu res from these writings, which Miller and Miller did in The Diamond Body (1981): 1. The aspirant must be at least 30 years old before his study of mysticism shoul d be initiated. This ensures grounding in the day-to-day life and reduces th e chances that the immature seeker desires transcendent escape from reality. 2. Specific moral qualities were required of candidates before the myst ics were willing to reveal their secret knowledge, or Gnosis. We might assume that these quali ties would include those of importance in the Torah, or Law. 3. Twelve to forty days of ascetic practices, including fasting and prayer, pr eceded the soul's penetration to the revelation of the Throne."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"4. Techniques for facilitating the journey included hymns and songs, the r ecitation of secret or holy names of God, and magical seals to protect the aspirant.

The posture recommended during meditation is to sit in a low chair, be nd forward until the head rests on the knees. This posture enhanced the ability to experi ence altered states of consciousness through changes in blood flow and subtle vibrations indu ced in the skeletal system by reciting god names. Breathing becomes shallow in this position. 6. The further one progresses upon the path, the greater the dangers of psych ological disintegration. The worthiness of the soul is tested on every level-- physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. The Qabalistic practice of creating and dis solving images as containers for psychic forces acts as a protection against identification with, or deification of symbols. Such potent symbols of wholeness, such as the Tree of Life, are a dan ger in themselves as they promote the identification of the ego with the Self . If the aspirant were unworthy, he could penetrate no further. The angels guarding the gates would c onfuse his mind and disturb his senses, (which shouldn't be too difficult aft er 40 days of fasting). This interference could include hallucinations (rather than visionary e xperience), and psychosomatic manifestations of discomfort. In the Eastern systems of m editation, these phenomena are regarded as blocks to the flow of Kundalini up the spine . 7. Once the ecstatic state has been attained by the mystic, he ascends thr ough what were variously described as seven heavens or chambers. The soul ascends toward it s original home. Counting from the bottom of the Tree of Life upwards, this would include the spheres of Malkuth through Chesed. 8. At this point the soul receives its revelation. It is the vision of God as King on His Throne. This vision of God as King is the magical image of the sphere Ches ed, #4 on the Tree of Life. It is below the Abyss, where visionary I-Thou imagination is s till possible. The gulf between the soul and God is not bridged below the Abyss. This med itation did not aspire to even an understanding of the true nature of God, let alone a reunion o f the soul with Godhead. It was ecstatic, not transcendent. This mystic path provided perception of the phenomena of the Throne-Char iot, the awful mystery that surrounds God's majesty. A voice is heard to speak from the \" Throne of Fire.\" It conveys the secret of heaven and earth to the aspirant. It gives him th e names of Knowledge, or Gnosis. Use of this Knowledge could be viewed as the aspirant's creation of the sph ere Daath. Daath is unique among the Sephiroth on the ascent up the Tree. In order for t he initiate to experience Daath, he is required to first create it. This is unlike the other spheres, which are a priori givens. Experience of the reciprocal view of the Diamond Body figu re brings one back onto the Middle Pillar on the threshold of the Abyss. In The Diamond Body , we find that, Meditation is a procedure. Daath, as a knowledge-contact, is a quantum change induced through Grace. It is God's answer to the call of the aspirant, and cannot be induced t hrough"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"effort alone. In creating a Daath state of consciousness, the aspirant has cross ed 'an abyss' from a procedure to a grace. In a classification of creative, psychedelic (mind-expanding), and unitive st ates, this development is best described as 'psychedelic.' The characteristic experie nce is a transient altered state of consciousness. This ecstasy includes the experience of loss of self, time, or space. There is an infusion of a special knowledge, and a purification of self. The original Merkabah mystics did not aspire for this vision with intense love of God. They did not concern themselves with speculation concerning the immanence of God in matter, through the Shekinah. Their interest lay in the direct experiential process of c ontemplating their mandala-symbol until it took on a life of its own--a divine life. This entity projectes a revelatory character. But the immanence of God-in-matter is a philosophical issue open to speculati on. The geometry of the Throne-Chariot or Diamond Body relates directly to the for mation of matter. We might speculate that these geometrical representations of archetypal r elationships have a great deal to do with fundamental patterns underlying all matter, even if the y are only Ruachian models. The figure of the Throne-Chariot (and its reciprocal, the Vector Equilibri um Matrix) and the basic blueprint for the formation of matter are not distinct and separate. Th is threshold of matter, or DAATH, the Invisible Sphere does disclose the minimum conceptu al elements necessary to depict the spiritual order inherent in matter. There is no w ay to intellectually grasp Reality beyond the Abyss. Penetration into these realms requires int ense devotion or love. For any information regarding these planes we must rely on the testim ony of saints who have journeys in consciousness to these realms. Knowledge (Gnosis or Daath) takes the soul to the uppermost reaches of the causal pl ane. This is the limit to the realm of the mind. There is neither mind n or matter across the Abyss. Here is the limit of the mind's ability to comprehend divine order concept ually. It is the emptying out of symbolic meaning in preparation for direct experience of th e Reality of God, through Union. Several graphic depictions of the descriptions of the Throne-Chariot given in the SEPHIR YETZIRAH have been developed through the years by Jews and occultists. A group known as the Chariot of Fire from Los Angeles has used the information to de pict a system in which all the paths are compacted onto an octahedron. In this arrange ment, the seven double letters are paths connecting the six spheres which corres pond to the cardinal directions, above and below, and the central Inner Court. This Inner Court is com prised of the three Mother letters--Aleph, Mem, and Shin--plus the nexus point whic h is composed of Aleph/Tau. In his book, THE TAROT (1947), Paul Foster Case developed an array which shows close r harmony with the closest-packed spheres of the diamond structure. Here th e paths are dispersed over the octahedron and its containing cube. It is important to include both the octahedron and the cube in the modeling. When both are visualized, the figure has the ability"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"to reproduce itself indefinitely. It generates and regenerates itself mat hematically, like a fractal. It projects outward or inward in an infinite geometrical progression. There is an infinite series of octahedrons within cubes within octah edrons within cubes. This is another way of viewing the matrix structure which has been described el sewhere as the Vector Equilibrium Matrix, and it shares its essence with the qabalistic Tr ee of Life geometry. In hermetic magic, a lightbody vehicle, or body of light, is activated to do more advanc ed magical work. The Mer-Ka-Ba is the vehicle of Light mentioned in the Bibl e by Ezekiel. Some say in Egyptian, \"Mer\" means Light. \"Ka\" means Spirit. \"Ba\" means Body or Reality. The word Merkabah is Hebrew, meaning \"chariot\" or \"vehicle\", from t he Hebrew root resh-kaf-bet meaning \"to ride\". Merkabah mysticism (\" ma`aseh ha-merkabah \") is a branch of Jewish Kabbalah. It refers to Ezekiel's vision. (see Gershom Sc holem \"Kabbalah\" page 373). From Aryeh Kaplan \" Meditation and Kabbalah \" page 19, we hear: \" The word Merkava comes from the root Rakhav meaning \"to ride\", and hence means a \"chariot\" or \"riding vehicle\". In general, the concept of riding involves t ravelling and leaving one's natural place. When the Bible says that God \"rides\", it means that He l eaves His natural state where He is absolutely unknowable and inconceivable, and allows Him self to be visualised by the prophets. One who \"sees\" God in this manner is said to expe rience a Merkava vision. The term Maaseh Merkava or \"workings of the Merkava\" refers to the setting up of a Merkava, that is, attaining a state where a Merkava vision can be attained. From the context in which this term is used in the Kabbalah texts, it is ob vious that Maaseh Merkava refers to the meditative techniques involved in attaining this m ystical experience. \" Most modern students of Qabala are familiar with the standard 2-dimensi onal representation of the Tree, which is drawn \"flat,\" even though the circ les are always conceived of as spheres. There is also a long tradition of a so-called 4-dimensi onal Tree of Life diagram, based on The Book of Formation -- Sephir Yetzirah . This geometrical figure consists of two interfacing pyramids surrounding a central core, within an enclosing cube. This octahedron-within-a-cube happens to be the crystal structure of diamond, a face- centered-cubic lattice. Recalling that Abraham is also the patriarch of the Moslems, it is interesting to note reference to a spiritual body, a \"diamond body\", in the w riting of Shaikh Amad Ahsa'i from the 13th century. Speaking of a substance akin to that of the medieval Philosopher's Stone, he equated the \"diamond body\" with the \"R esurrection Body\" of the faithful believer in the Paradise of the future Aeon. For the Qabalists, meditation on this figure provided a mystical body as a vehicl e for consciousness in imaginal space. This diamond body was used during medi tation to enter the inner court of Divinity, symbolized by the center of the figure. Here t he Beginning and End of time are co-temporaneous, space ceases to be a hindrance, and the m ystic beheld the ecstatic vision of the Lord on His Throne. The geometry was a \"gateway\" to another dimension of experience. This Alpha-Omega point has all the physical qualities of Vector Equilibr ium. The ancient meditation practice was known as Merkabah mysticism, and those who practic ed it called themselves, \"Riders in the Chariot.\" They claimed to see into the futur e. This insinuates"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"that the figure is a \"vehicle\" for moving consciousness through imaginal time and space. It seems to be a metaphysical \"time machine,\" or inter-dimensional gatew ay. As in most design or mandala meditations, the aspirant pictures him or he rself at the center of the figure through visualization, contemplation, and identifi cation. Through this process of centering, these mystics came to know themselves and God. Perhaps they learned, as Fuller later discovered, of the unusual anomalous conditions of perfect equilibrium. This meditation provided a specific technique for esc aping from time. Its realization meant instantaneous enlightenment, a paradoxical leap out of Ti me. It yields transcendence. Occultist, Paul Foster Case published an array of this type in his book, The Tarot (1947). Aware of the ancient mystic practice, he included the figure in his s tudy of Qabala, calling it alternately the Key of the Cosmos and Numbers, or the Cube of Space. Again, w e have the form of the octahedron-within- a-cube. Vector Equilibrium and the Cube of Space are mathematical duals, or reciprocals of one another. They \"jitterbug\" back and forth as the figure grows outward to fill all space. They are two ways of looking at the same ge ometrical phenomena. Case pointed out that its construction was based on the six-pointed Star of David, (or Shield of David), also known as \"The Star of the Macrocosm.\" His descriptor s of zero as a sacred, empty, consciousness field reiterate the qualities of Vect or Equilibrium. Zero is a symbol of the absence of quality, quantity, or mass. Thus it denotes ab solute freedom from every limitation whatever. It is a sign of the infinite and e ternal Conscious Energy, itself No-Thing, though manifest in everything. It is That which was , is, and shall be forever; but it is nothing we can name. Boundless infinitely potenti al, living light, it is the rootless root of all things, of all activities, of all modes of consciousness . In it are included all imaginable and unimaginable possibilities, but it transce nds them all. The Qabalists call it: (a) No-Thing; (b) The Boundless; (c) Limitless L ight. Pure Conscious Energy, above and beyond thought, to us it is Superconsciousness. With their fascination for completely regular figures, the Greeks devi sed a way of establishing XYZ coordinates within a cube. Our science and method of ori entation has been stuck with that model ever since. However, nature's own most economi cal coordination is in triangles and tetrahedra, rather than squares or cubes. Ve ctor Equilibrium is more in line with modern Quantum Mechanical model s than the Newtonian XYZ. It expresses more degrees of freedom. So, close examination of the underlying geometry of the Tree of Life reveals that the ancients were not lacking a very deep intuitive awareness of the true stru cture of matter and the universe. The underlying geometrical matrix of the multi-dim ensional Tree is, in fact, Vector Equilibrium.

CHAPTER VIII: LUST or STRENGTH DEMETER/PERSEPHONE "},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"The story of the abduction of Demeter's daughter, Persephone, and her sub sequent resurrection and return, fascinated the ancient world for more than 2,000 year s. This mystery religion was celebrated at the meadow in Eleusis where the or iginal rape occurred, continuing the Egyptian tradition of promising life after death to init iates of the cult. The major motifs of this myth-theme include pristine virginity, be trayal, rape, lust, abduction, depression, and reunion of the mother and daughter. The initi ate to whom these mysteries were revealed underwent a profound spiritual transformat ion. The experience was so awesome that no one ever broke their vow of silence concerning the climax of the rite. This vital element has been open to philosophical speculation ever since, but it is strongly suspected to involve a psychedelic brew called the kykeon . This ceremonial drink was used to produce the visionary experience know n as epoptia . The real glittering vessel is the body of light and the kykeon is light. The inner child must accept becoming Queen in this story of feminine empowerment, and over coming the fear of being consumed by the unconscious, much as the heroine in the fairytale Alice In Wonderland, who innocently partakes mind-altering substances. Demeter is the earthiest variation of the Mediterranean Great Goddes s. She represents not only fertility, but also brought the gift of agriculture to ancient Greece . Therefore, Demeter is considered the fertile, or cultivated soil while Persephone is t he virgin soil. The transition from hunting and gathering to cultivation of crops such as corn and wheat marke d a dramatic change in early civilizations. Persephone, as Kore or Virgin, is also ou r inner child, our divine child that lives half in the light, half in the subc onscious dark. Through this child we are subject to fears we don't understand, trapped and ra ped by life, and expected to master it without any help. The establishment of the Eleusinian Mysteries is related in the HO MERIC HYMN TO DEMETER. After the abduction of her daughter by Hades, Lord of the Under world, the mourning Demeter traveled to Eleusis (near Athens), and took refuge by t he Well of the Maidens. She demanded that the local inhabitants build her a sanctuary th ere. After she was reunited with her daughter she revealed the rites and began teachi ng her mysteries, including the cultivation of wheat. The early history of the cult reports two types of initiations. All initiat ions prepare the aspirant to receive the vision of light, to release subconscious fears and master them. One was concerned with the reunion of the goddesses; the other concerne d the possibility of man's immortalization. The Great Goddess has always been considered able t o grant immortality to humans, and initiates experienced revelations which assu red the soul a blissful existence after death. Mircea Eliade recounts how the symbolic death of Persephone had great conse quences for mankind: \"As the result of it, an Olympian and benevolent goddess temporar ily inhabited the kingdom of the dead. She had annulled the unbridgeable distance bet ween Hades and Olympus. Mediatrix between the two divine world, she could thereafte r intervene in the destiny of mortals.\""},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Archaeologists have established that the colonization of Eleusis occurred in the fifteenth century B.C. Celebrants came there regularly for the next 2,000 years. their f ootprints can still be seen where they wore grooves in the stones by dancing around the w ell. Because of social and cultural changes during this period, the Mysteries altered som ewhat over time, but the basic message remained the same. Psychologically, it means that down times are part of the natural cycle. Depr essions which feel like death, and feel like we have one foot in each world must simpl y be endured. Persephone endured passively, embracing this feeling by willingly dee pening it even further. It is not just time-out from real life, but an archetypal Way of Bein g which is just as real as extroverted life. Plumbing the depths means a genuine transformative experience, and natu rally induces fears and shrinking. The power of death transfixes us--it is fear of death , fear of dying which grips us and it is mad to resist. We can let go of our negative evaluation of \"underworld\" experience, become one with the mystery and undergo the s hamanic initiation it implies, becoming at home in the underworld. Demeter's pathology is extreme grief, mourning, endless suffering of ove rwhelming loss which overwhelms all life-giving, nurturing energy. It is felt as a loss of sel f that is also a self-indulgence if it never ceases. A mother's rage and grief can wo und her children. Her animus may be a enslaved by patriarchy which she grudgingly serves. If she is n ot free of her own father-complex, how can she protect her children from this rav aging masculine force? So she insists on a false image of control, perfectionism and an ideali zation of family roles. She is passive-aggressive, but appears docile because of the severe de gree of repression. PHYSICAL FORM Demeter is clearly an earth-mother, like Gaia, the original Greek progenit or. She is represented physically as the seed (Persephone) which is plante d beneath the earth (abduction to the underworld) and returned once again in the spring, wit h the sprouting of the grain. But she is also so much more than an agricultural metaphor. The rape of Persephone by Hades is one of the most celebrated myths. On account of Persephone's relationship with Hades we have a fallow winter for 1/3 of the year, representing that time she is in the underworld. The ancient Gree ks had a habit of storing grain in great earthen jars in large holes in the ground as a natural form of refri geration. Her abduction by Hades, or forceful removal to the dark underworld, also symboli zes the fact that we are asleep and unconscious for 1/3 of the time each day. Persep hone is dragged daily under the surface of the earth (day-world), below the threshold of c onsciousness, into the profound depths of the unconscious. Sleep is like a \"little deat h,\" and dreams come from the perspective of soul or psyche, not ego. Hades' realm of darkness and death is that of our instinctive memories an d bondage to the collective past of mankind. He rules over the deepest levels of the uncon scious of mankind. Persephone falls into a state of identification, symbolized by her marr iage, with this substratum of human consciousness. Through the violent metaphor of rape, s he is"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"permanently altered from being merely maiden, (Demeter's daughter) , into Hades' wife, austere and awesome Queen of the Underworld. Psyche's final task, stealing some of the beauty of Persephone, means findi ng the beauty of death as the counterpart to birth and the life force. They are natural comp lements and to appreciate that assuages some of the agony of grief and bereavement which, paradoxic ally, also separate one from active life. Psyche's descent into Hades is like a shamanic journey into the underworld. It heralds a later resurrection, or rebirth. The d escent may come through the death of a beloved, sucking us into the underworld. Locked in this phase, we instinctively or compulsively retreat, withdraw, or curb our availability to others. It may result from grief, betrayal, physical molestation, or depression, or addi ction. Chemical addictions force one into congress with the underworld, the cr iminal element, reprehensible though it may be. In particular, intravenous drug use is a th inly-veiled sexual substitute with predictable gratification. Characteristically, bec ause she suffers so deeply, Psyche becomes suicidal. Yet, this underworld is an immortal realm. In t he dark descent into ourselves, the challenge is to remain mindful and conscious of the e xperience. In the myth, Zeus planned this entire affair by offering Persephone t o his brother Hades. He conspired with Gaea and Hekate to bring it about and they betrayed her trus t. But when Zeus saw how distraught Demeter became at the loss of her daughte r, he intervened. His heart was softened at the sight of his powerful sister's depres sion and lack of functionality. Zeus sent Hermes to retrieve Persephone, and she had a blissful reu nion with her mother. Because she had eaten several pomegranate seeds while in Hades, she is compelled to return for a portion of each year. This cyclic \"burial and resurrection\" tu rns the whole process into a meaningful cyclic ritual which indicates that the ind ividualized consciousness has assimilated the experience of man's common roots, the instincts of t he collective unconscious, but returns to the day world at the summons of the Spirit. Demeter/Persephone expresses the mystery of mother and daughters -- MY MOTHER, MY SELF --which is a union of sames. Demeter is Persephone in her renascent f orm. Modern women experience this force in the continuity of generations. The matri linear line extends back to one's grandmother and mother, and forward in one's daughters. It isn' t quite the same for the birth of sons; they are distinctly other, as our fathers are. The re is an essential blood-bond between female members of a family who share the mystery of the generation of life from their own substance. Thus, a woman's essential self is rebor n in her daughter, and the paradox of the eternal Virgin-Mother lives on. The Value of Biodiversity , David Takacs, and Value in Diversity, by Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin state that the causes of diversity are as diverse as diversity it self. A first factor is that the forest has retreated into many separate sanctuaries during dr ier spells in ice ages and then been repeatedly reintegrated again. Another factor for diversi ty is the rise of forest to climax in an environment of damage through storm and fire creating a f ractal dynamic of destruction and regeneration over evolutionary time-scales.

It will be so vast and long-lasting that pe ople will grab roots from the trees and children from the breast.\" Nostradamus C1 Q67 (Hogue 213). The next few decades will witness a wildlife holocaust, a great extinct ion numbered among the five most serious threats to life in earth during its entire histor y. By the turn of the millennium, over a million kinds of animals, plants and fungi are expec ted to be driven to extinction; by the year 2050, half of all the species alive today could be lost fore ver. The disaster threatens to surpass the mass extinction of 65 million years ago whe n the dinosaurs disappeared. The causes are diverse, but they all come down to human impact w ithout foresight. Overhunting and overfishing, pollution and the trade in wildl ife all play a part. But by far the greatest cause of the extinctions is the destruction of wi ld habitats for farming, fuel, industry and a host of other uses. The world's tropical rainforests, which contain at least half the world' s species, are failing fast: little more than half of their original expanse still remains , and an area as big as Romania is cleared each year. The temperate forests are likewise under s iege in Siberia. Half the world's wetlands - other abundant habitats - have been draine d or developed and species-rich coral reefs are being destroyed throughout the earth's w armer seas. Species are now becoming extinct at 25,000 times the natural rate (Lean 127). Currently ther e is a species being lost about every 12 minutes and the rate is steadily increas ing as remaining areas of high diversity become fractured. The loss of one plant can cause the loss of as many as 30 kinds of animals and insects which depend upon it, so the whole p rocess has catastrophic potentiality. Even the loss of a single species can be a tragedy, because each form of life is a s torehouse of irreplaceable substances. Every civilization has been rooted in the we alth of nature the local environment has provided. The collection of seeds and domestication of wild animals made the first agriculture and shepherding of flocks possible. Sele ctive breeding has subsequently made our domesticated and food species more productive; and abundant natural resources enabled the agricultural and urban social revolutions t o take off, later leading to the industrial revolution whose consequences so effect biodi versity today. Despite these changes, genetic resources, taken from the wild, still sustain modern societies, providing medicines, food and raw materials for industry. They also form th e foundation resource for genetic technologies of the future. Without biodiversit y, biotechnology is a destitute science. Wasting the Sheaf of Demeter: The Dwindling Diversity of Food. The healt h of the world's food resources and harvest productivity is even more dependent on genetic r esources. We are utterly dependent on our domesticated food plants and animals for our own survival. Many of these are dwindling in diversity as diverse local types of produce give way to large industrial productions for world markets. The number of differen t species being used is dropping rapidly and even more worrying the genetic diversity of even our maj or staples is being reduced rapidly by major production of low-diversity and even frankly m onoclonal genetically-engineered varieties. \" Just three species - wheat, rice and maize - provide half the world's food; another four - potato, barley, sweet potato and cassava - bring the total to thre e quarters. Such overwhelming dependence on a few crops is dangerous; disease can spr ead"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"rapidly through monocultures - as it did through the Irish potato harvest in the 1840s, causing a fifth of the country's people to die\" (Lean et. al. 127). Crops need to be given new protection every few years, because pests and dise ase develop ways around their existing defenses, requiring one to interbreed them with other strains, often wild ones to introduce new traits. It is believed that the evoluti onary race between parasite and host is a principal reason for sexuality in higher organisms. \" In the 1960s an epidemic of the wheat disease, stripe rust, struck the US; the state of Mont ana repeatedly lost a third of its harvest. Genes from a wild wheat from Turkey saved the situati on, providing resistance to this and 50 other diseases. In 1970 an even more virulent plague spre ad by up to 150 kilometers a day across the American corn belt. lt devastated a sixth of the maiz e crop, wiping out half the harvest of some Southern states, at a cost of some $2 billion \" (Lean 127). Nevertheless modern industrial agricultural and forestry processes are depending ever more recklessly on monoclonal genetically-engineered varieties. Indone sia plans to plant 250,000 hectares of forest in genetically-engineered monoclonal teak in a single op eration. The burning question is where the next generation of such trees wil l come from once they succumb to parasite adaption if the wild areas containing the genetic diver sity from which these varieties come are converted to plantation use. Such short-term th inking could become an evolutionary terminal condition for humankind. Maize has been particularly vulnerable to such disasters, as inbreeding has giv en it an almost uniform genetic pattern - and new genes from wild varieties have been urgen tly needed. Two ancestors of the plant were found in Mexico in the late 1970s; they can confer re sistance to seven of the domestic crop's major diseases, and can turn it into a perennial c rop, allowing it to spring up every year like grass, without resowing. These maizes have been cal led the botanical find of the century; ominously, just a few stalks of them were discov ered in a tiny area now threatened with destruction, (Lean et. al. 127). The diversity of many of our essential food plants is thus at best marginall y conserved. The growing of commercial hybrid stocks of low diversity over vast productive are as of the earth's surface has a catastrophic effect on the diversity of the very speci es on which we depend. The original ecosystemic variety of locally-adapted types is lost as en tire populations convert to only a few types. Disease resistance is often only late r to be discovered to be missing in all but one or two of the cultivated varieties. Wi ld varieties in their original habitat are frequently under threat. Plant patenting driv es diversity down further, placing legal constraints on free propagation, reducing the entire world market to a few patented varieties, which often have low biodiversity because the y are developed from a few highly selected individuals, or even a single parent. Twenty years ago a group of nine leading American biologists warned that destru ction of wildlife habitats and their genetic and species diversity was a threat to civilization \"second only to thermonuclear war\". Since then their concerns have largely gone unh eeded but their dark prophesies are being fulfilled. Life on earth may, at best, ta ke millions of years to recover. The forest is burning 34% faster and the seas are being overfish ed. In the next 25 years, if we don't take decisive action the greatest species extinction for 200 million years will in all probability occur.

Our long-term survival pros pects are intimately connected to the richness of biodiversity. The more we red uce it to a fragile skeleton the greater the danger we will ourselves expire as a species through even a mild disruption to the earthly environment.

She is not the emotionally unavailable Ice Queen, nor the raging Dragon Lady . But her pathology can come through the roles of the \"Saint Mom,\" or Sick Mother, who bin d their children to themselves incestuously through guilt or other emot ions. Either a man or woman can express the Demetrian qualities. She nurture s; she is acceptant and has the ability to endure despite great pain and suffering. It is her nat ure to give of herself to excess, and even though it may be a codependent pattern, her moti vation is love. Her involvement in eternal cycles even gives her the capacity to cope with d eath (Hades). She is strongly empathetic. Since she is sympathetic, she can frequent ly be a comfort to those around her. She is an excellent nurse, whether baby-sitting her gr andchild, tending the wounded, distraught individual, or perhaps as counselor or psychotherapi st. On the negative side, she may be possessed by the spirit of motherhood, tying ot hers to her to fulfill her compulsive need.

In reality, her over-emotional nature is feeding off the children with whom she refuses to break off her identification. In this respect she is like Sekmet, the Egyptian child-devouring lio ness. In the tarot trump STRENGTH this lion is the instinctual nature which becomes tam ed by feminine spirit. Love (\"smother-love\") can be devouring and its primal nature requires a degree of humanizing to tame its destructive element. Patience, fortitude , faith, and strength are distilled from the raw life force. When we can observe our destructi ve patterns accurately and actively change the patterns of codependence, we change the result, thu s taming the lion and becoming a moral force. True strength is spiritual, not just physical, and we must learn to use th is strength of spirit to sustain ourselves in times of trouble, to lift ourselves above wordly turmoi l. We must realize that spiritual nurturance is always there if we just reach for h eavenly comfort. In the myth, when Hades rapes Persephone, he destroys her lifestyle an d her naive psychological state. It derives its strength from innocence and the life and growth promoting energy of her mother. This state mandates that she is raped out of the unconscious identification with her mother to find her own individ uality, to find and express her inner passions and reconcile with her primal instinct s. In doing so, she becomes a survivor with fortitude -- the mixture of strength, patience and cour age. The paradox is that this symbolic rape is either creative or destructive . When it is literalized in a life, it is certainly destructive, usually taking seve ral years to resolve. She is violated by the cold, brutal, pathological forces which lie in the very pit of h uman existence--the dark side. Who wants to think about the brutal necessit y of death when cavorting with one's friends in a flowery meadow on a beautiful spring day? I n a sense, we would all like to remain close to the nurturing bosom of the mother. But the transpersonal force of life (Zeus) and material reality (Gaea) conspire to initiate th e process of transformation. Yet, the mythic meaning of Hades is not only \"bad.\" Hades is also the dept hs of the soul which are certainly sacred. We need not be physically raped in order to come i nto close association with Persephone's essence. \"Initiation\" contains images of b eing seized or suddenly rapt away into a different state of consciousness. We therefore p artake of Persephone's initiation into the underworld life through our sudd en depressions, our revulsions, or passionate hatreds. When we feel cold and numb, or lifeless, or would like to flee but cannot, w e experience aspects of her plight. Initiation to the underworld transforms our relati on to it. It may come through the inescapable clutches of a Demon Lover, such as addiction, or codependence. We resist being sucked down into the underworld life, thrashing and f ighting our own darker natures, trying to recapture days when our disposition was sunny and warm. When we are invaded by the dark power of the subconscious, we come face to face wit h the inevitability of our own demise, and recoil in anguish, resisting the abdu ction."},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Persephone is a Kore, or archetypal Maiden, like Athena, Artemis, and Psyche .

We are the archet ypal virgin bride when we are torn our of our union with what is familiar and forced into con gress with what is alien and repugnant to our consciousness. Whether truth or fiction, this feeling is reported by UFO abductees , who certainly have the symptoms of post traumatic stress. They are forcibly ripped from the fabr ic of ordinary life and thrust into an alien world where all their boundaries are violated at wi ll, perhaps for the rest of their lives. A primary aspect of the current UFO mytheme is that they inhabit secret underground compounds at various places on the globe. Victims report both literal and mind-rape as typical abduction experi ences. Like the daughter Persephone, they are doomed to die to their old condition, and this i s experienced as an act of unconditional surrender. There are many ways the ego undergoes psychological rape, overpowered by the contents of the collective unconsciou s. One never truly recovers from this experience, but lives forevermore with \"one foot in each world,\" in each reality. Victims of stalking or hostages experience much the same t rauma, feeling they can no longer control their lives. Some come to identify with their captors --the Stockholm syndrome. Meanwhile, the conscious day-world perspective mourns and endures. I t may suffer a neurotic, depressive suffering for the sake of suffering with no fur ther aim. There is no motivation for pursuing other interests except to seek refuge in the routine of everyday reality. Jung has said that \"...by entering into the figure of Demeter we realize the universal principle of life, which is to be pursued, raped, to fail to und erstand, to rage and grieve, but then to get everything back and be born again.\" There is a third element to Demeter/Persephone, called Hekate, whic h completes the image of the life-cycle of women: maidenhood, motherhood, and old woman.

She is an old hag wh o dwells in caves and has the power of foreseeing the future. She knows the necessit y of the abduction and its purposeful value. She provides us with an objective viewpoint on our own cat astrophes which sees them as an integral part of the cycle of life and death. Her pers pective is from that of the final stage.

Women have their own mode of being, distinct from th at of men, based on biological rhythms, and the woman's mysteries of blood and birth. It is refl ected positively in \"Fertility Spirituality\" or gender reunion. Feminine val ues, present in both men and women, tend to be repressed or \"put down\" into the underworld of t he subconscious. They fall into the chasm, or netherworld, which sucks th em down into the void. It is then that we feel that our feminine natures or sensitivity have \"gone to hell.\" Hence, we suffer an emotional woundedness, or a rupture in the fabric of our personalities. The healing of this wound comes from reuniting with that which w e are most like, not through the union of opposites. We must mourn and nurse our own wounde dness with a descent into the depths to experience our innermost feminine Self . This reunion with the Kore is also the reunion with the core of one's essential being. Persepho ne's resplendent beauty is her uniqueness. The concept heuresis, the finding of one's lost self, or the mother/ daughter reunion, relates to the resurrection of personal creativity. When energy is building in the subconscious for a new idea or creative project, it is much like gestation. We go through an incubat ion period where we feel unfruitful or non-productive. We feel sterile, and then the unconscious energy wells up, offering us a treasure we have been seeking. \"Spring\" i s not only a season, but a state of mind. We flower in our own time. We can find reconnection with the feminine source of life. This myth of Demeter and Kore is the feminine counterpart of the Horus-Osiris myth which reconc iles division in the male psyche. Feminine consciousness is an experience of our own sense of int eriority. First it is narcissistic (Kore was enraptured with the narcissus flowers in the field). The mode is subjective, almost auto-erotic in its self-love and self-appreciation. Li ke Psyche, Kore must get past the stage of \"nothing but projection\" of her idealistic fantasie s. By relating to Demeter/Kore, we come to understand that feminine consc iousness extends both upwards and downwards, and this widens our conscious perspecti ve. We come to share in the eternal cycle with an awareness newly risen from the dep ths. Through the catharsis and rejuvenation demonstrated in the myth, we gain a sense of our un iqueness in the tide of generations of man, abolishing our isolation and returning our sens e of wholeness. Paradoxically, we are mature female and child in one being. We always r emain our mother's child, no matter how old we are. The climax of the Demeter mystery is not revealed historically, since it cannot be told. It must be lived and requires \"being,\" not just knowing about it. It requir es a very personal entry into the depths of the unknown self, searching for our own lost sou l. Her mystery is"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"now lived out as a process of psychic transformation, if not celebrated in rit e. Just ask the mother whose last child has recently \"left the nest.\" It is instinc tual, for mothers to guard their children from being seduced out of childhood, from being \"captivate d\" by another, and spirited away from her domain. The tenderness of maternal love is a key characteristic of Demeter's per sonality. However, in her negative phase she ravages the earth herself with drought. Withholdi ng the life giving waters kills most of the remaining plant life, opening the bare eart h to erosion. Maybe this was her revenge on Gaea for yawning wide to accept the pair into the bowe ls of the earth. Denied her preferred mode of expression, Demeter become s her alter-ego (shadow-self), a goddess of death and destruction. We are like Demeter when we grieve for our dead relatives (like the Piet a, Mary mourning Christ), or anticipate the fear of death. The rape of Persephone and her pass iveness show how helpless we are when confronted with death. But lust, decay, death , and birth are all parts of the world of the mother, and she must endure her sufferin g patiently. Persephone is also passive when confronted with overt sexual aggression. We ar e like Persephone if we have anxiety and hostility toward an aggressive spouse. Perse phone is passive-aggressive, because she cannot consciously assert herself. Poor P ersephone could not even call for her father's aid, since he had betrayed her. She had a naive, over -idealized conception of him. Even parents cannot understand the rape victim, and her \"being-in- hell\" can represent the psychological distance which separates the victim from her family. Women experience themselves as the biological and spiritual source of life . When the mother finds the daughter again, it annuls the suffering and violence of the rape and restores the unity of mother and daughter after her \"marriage of death.\" Th e fundamental change is that a male has encroached on the female world. Kore has been initiat ed into and fascinated by the male earthy sexuality. She is penetrated by and infused wi th this male spirit of the depths and becomes pregnant. She becomes identical with her mother Demeter when she is transformed into a mother herself. The birth of the divine son marks the center of the myth; Kore is tran smuted from girlhood to womanhood through the process of childbearing. Through her self-sacrif ice, she learns what it means to be a woman on a personal level. Then, her mother's emotional suf fering becomes her own. She achieves union with a higher spiritual aspect of f eminine life, and is transformed. She is no longer confined passively in the underworld, but be comes one of the regal queens of heaven, the earth, and the underworld. Through her male son, t he masculine spirit is integrated into herself and is no longer foreign. Sh e sees it as an extension and variation of herself. The male initiate to the Eleusinian mysteries identified hims elf with Demeter to contact his own feminine aspect. This is a stepping-stone in the male spiritual q uest. A man seeks his anima to function as a bridge to the unconscious. He did, of course, come from th e mother and also needs to re-connect with her life-giving creative powers and in stinctual body- knowledge.

San Francisco: Council on Spiritual Practices SPIRITUAL MYTH The Greek myths come from older Egyptian counterparts. And in every se nse, Persephone is Isis. When the Greek (Ptolemy) dynasties ruled Egypt, syncretism re turned active worship of this archetype in Greek form back to its native soil. She is most popularly spoken of in Jungian circles now as the Black Madonna, the sensuous femin ine power of the body. The body knows instinctively how to be born, give birth, and how to die . In Greece, the Eleusinian festivals, the Lesser Mysteries were c elebrated in the spring, and formed a preliminary probation period of the Greater Mysteries conduct ed in the Autumn (September and October). Initiation was open to both men and women providi ng they spoke Greek, had killed no fellow being, and had passed through the Les ser Mysteries. The rites involved processions, sacrifices, dances, and songs. The frolicking i n the lush, flowering meadows by the sea must have been a breath of fresh air for the At henians. They lived in squalid hovels with dingy, dirty streets, even though the magnific ent Parthenon with its temples formed the heart of the city. They were like our typical city-dwellers who long for revival in a heavenly pastoral setting. A third stage of initiation was open to those who had been initiates for a year. I t culminated in a supreme vision, the nature of which we may only guess. It was probably the revelation of identity between Persephone's son and the ear of corn. But some have sp eculated that it involved a graphic enactment of the rape of Persephone. Attempts have been mad e at reconstructing the rites, but only fragments are available. Included w ere ritual fasting and imbibing of the sacred drink or kykeon, a mind-altering beverage. What is know n is that after a sacramental meal (which represents a sacred marriage like com munion), the final vision took place in a dazzling light, and included an invocation of Kore. The Eleusinian Mysteries opened a new religious dimension for the Me diterranean world, with the promise of immortality. Through them, the initiate perceived a continuity between life and death. It opened speculation concerning the underworld whi ch was suppressed by the predominant Olympian religion. The same dynamic happens in the mod ern psyche, obsessed by sexuality, power, and the day-world. Trauma may lead us into the under world, and we seek a shaman or therapist to help guide us through these dark realm s. Demeter/Persephone became the most popular of Greek goddesses dur ing this period. Initiation into her cult guaranteed a sort of \"adoption\" by her. A major char acteristic of the cult which became paradigmatic for most other Mystery cults was th e strict emphasis on silence and secrecy. Thereafter, it became stylish for Masters to reveal their secrets only to their initiates. In the third century B.C. this Greek cult became amalgamated with th e Egyptian cult of Isis and Osiris. Isis was identified with the Great Mother, De meter, and Osiris was"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"identified with the initiated individual who attained \"salvation.\" Osiris was also identified with Dionysus (sometimes called Demeter's divine child) who was al so killed, dismembered, then resurrected. In the Hellenistic period, the Mysteries of Isis provided a ritual re birth at Eleusis as its central purpose. The object was for the initiate to become Osiris, rais ed from the dead by the magical power of the goddess Isis. Thus the best of Egyptian religious t enets was incorporated into Greek life. Accounts of this are found in Plutarch's ISIS AND OSIRIS , and THE GOLDEN ASS OF APULEIUS, by a Roman initiate. After fasting and meditation, the mystes took part in a mystery drama where h e personified Set, Aphophis, or Typhon in the form of a red ass. He was torme nted, and his lust and desirousness transformed through fully experiencing his in stinctual nature. The deep religious intensity of the aspirant produces transformation and th e identification with the dead Osiris. he journeys to Hades and sees the midnight sun shini ng brightly. He also sees the revelation of the celestial and infernal Gods, or becomes acquai nted with the archetypes of the collective unconscious. After this ritual death, he is raised by the power of Isis (Demeter). The Isis of Hellenistic times, as Nature and the Moon, was creator, moth er, nurse, and destroyer, just like Demeter. She also embodied Wisdom or Sophia; Osiris was Knowledge, Reason, and Logos. Through acceptance by Isis, the initiate caught in the instin ctual level of passion and lust, is raised to a spiritual life. The initiate believed t he goddess Isis could prolong life beyond the term fixed by Destiny, or fate. But this process invol ved a metamorphosis by undergoing a voluntary ritual death in order to obtain a spirit ual birthday. The living individual became \"divinized\" through the power s of the goddess. This Hellenistic mystery theology expresses the deepest Egyptian reli gious genius. Man's anima, as Psyche is sent to Hades to see Kore-Persephone who is a variati on of Venus-Isis in her underworld aspect. She opens the box and tries to sec ure the special \"beauty\" for herself. This means the man's anima equates beauty with good ness. He cannot believe a beautiful woman is capable of wickedness. This is a nai ve attitude which expects a real woman to enact his anima projections. A woman acquires the psych ic, rather than physical) beauty which results from being herself--the human sou l that knows it isn't the goddess. Psyche falls into a death-like sleep, but a transformed Eros appears to red eem her. The Greeks corresponded Eros with Osiris, who taught men and women genuine mutual love. Eros here is a psychological symbol of the Self. Further transformations of t he man's relationship with his anima are required before he can experience t he final Isis initiations. In these, Osiris is the secret ruler of the underworld, or personif ication of the collective unconscious. He is much more than a simple vegetation-god. When he is reborn as the Horus-child, he represents restored wholen ess or totality. He is the secret spiritual goal of the Isis Mysteries. The initiate passes th rough the three psychic stages toward a unification of the personality. It is produced through the image of one all- embracing Goddess. Isis is the symbol of the Self in feminine form."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"A religious experience must be accepted in its totality, and therefor e is lived as a lifestyle, publicly. But this does not imply telling one's inner secrets to ever yone, producing an ego inflation. The Self counsels us on the hiding or exposing of secrets. The c onscious, religious attributes of the secret Self, Osiris, underwent transformati ons until he became identified with the reborn human soul. Like Osiris, the human soul tends to fragment into several individual parts, represented by the pantheon of gods. Isis is the only divinity which keeps her unity. She is an emotional and feeling of totality which leads the way to conscious individuation. But to participate we mus t be more than an intellectually involved armchair philosopher. This mental interest d oe not transform the divine inner nucleus like experiential initiations do. Isis is the gu ide to the experience of oneness. The psyche is the only reality known through immediate experien ce. Isis gives meaning to suffering, and initiates the healing process. Man's fate is sim ilar to that of Osiris. The religious pattern revealed in the mysteries was that fi rst comes the realization of the anima, and then of the higher Self, Isis and Osiris. A positive relationship to the goddess produces psychological transformati on in earthly life, which produces immortality analogous to that of the philosopher's stone in alchemy. The aloofness of the Olympian gods is transcended through personal experience . Jung spoke of five forms of rebirth: 1) Metempsychosis. The transmigration of souls by passing through different bodily existences. 2) Reincarnation. Continuity of personality (ego-form) through rebirth in d ifferent human bodies. 3) Resurrection. Raising of the dead in a glorified or incorruptible \"sub tle body.\" 4). Rebirth. Renewal within the span of individual life with a change in functionality (healing), not essential nature. Or essential transformation (transmut ation). 5. Participative transformation. Indirect rebirth through witnessin g ceremony or rite, such as Mass or Eleusinian mysteries. The shadow side of this Demeter/Kore/Hades myth has penetrated our society and our spirituality as the real and imagined fear of the organized and unorganized cr iminal element in our society. The enemy is no longer way out there, such as the Com munist threat. It is right within our precincts, operating with no respect for boundaries, violating us at will. Spiritually, it means our naive well-meaning selves can no longer trust that most people will treat us honestly and well. The injunctions of mistrust are simp le: \"Don't go out after dark; lock your doors at all times; don't walk in many neighborhoods,\" etc. We are terrorized in our own communities, and not safe within our very homes. There is no sanctuary. Our society is being penetrated by an underground lif e whose violations of our being feel like rape--mind rape, which instills cons tant fear and stress. It"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"promotes coldness and mind-numbing cynicism. It even enters our drea ms. We feel helpless before it, both externally and internally, because of our seeming incapacity to d eal with this reality. The demon has us in his embrace, and our victim mentality takes over . Another form of spiritual domination is effect of the collective power ani mus--the masculine power drive--on women (and sometimes men), which enslaves t hem in service to the patriarchy. Out of touch with feminine feeling values, we inflict m eaningless suffering on one another. It results in broken relationships, drivenness, judgment alness, and high tension. Sometimes the unconscious inflicts its own autonomous form of mind-rape by overwhelming the ego with its contents. Marion Woodman speaks of the psychological implications of the mytheme in m odern life: ...Where the woman is caught in unconscious identification with the m other...she has to be raped our of that identification before she can find her own individuality. Thi s is the meaning of the Demeter-Persephone myth, where the Kore is carried off to the un derworld by Hades. If Demeter is out of touch with her inner Persephone, she is out of touch with her own essence. Persephone is a maiden who looks in the looking glass and goes through to other side, open s herself to the wealth of that inner world, experiences the ravishment and returns with a wealth of sensitivity and a sense of her own uniqueness--bearing new life. With out Persephone, Demeter is barren. Modern Demeters are beginning to realize that their own earth has been ravaged an d they are becoming so aware of the violation that they are trying to do something about it, not on ly for themselves but for their Persephones, their own biological daughters and ps ychological daughters. They realize they have been raped by the one-sidedness of the mascul ine principle that thrusts toward the goal without enjoying the pleasure of the journ ey. Ultimately, the feminine mysteries have to do with the sanctification of matter, and bei ng aware of ourselves and others as human beings in the reality of the moment. Throughout history mankind has employed psychoactive agents to heighten the e xperience of reality. The shamanic journey is classically conceived as a descent to Hell and ascent to divine realms. The cult of Demeter, one of the original Mystery schools, at Ele usis was no exception to this widespread pattern. Its secrets are only now being reveal ed through modern research and informed speculation. In the Demeter cult, thi s drink was called the Kykeon. Three thousand years ago in ancient Greece a mass religious event took pl ace every year in which a magical sacred brew was drunk by initiates in a ritual setting. Pindar said, \" Blessed is he who, having seen these rites, undertakes the way beneath the Earth. He knows the end of life, as well as its divinely granted beginning .\" One such sect was centered in Greece, and in the year 395 A.D. Alaric the G oth and his band overran and destroyed the Temple at Eleusis, the holy place where the f amous and two-thousand-year-old Eleusinian Mysteries had been practiced. The central feature of that yearly celebration, initiation, and revelation was the partaking of a powerfu l and mysterious potion, the kykeon. Far from being a minor and obscure sect, the Myst eries had been for centuries a central and important religious experience and ins pirational revelation whose initiates included essentially all the great names of Greek antiq uity. Its importance,"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"along with the secret of the divine and psychoactive sacrament used in t he yearly celebration, has remained to this day almost entirely ignored by scholars. Kykeon: KUKEW/N. Normally translated: I. \"potion\"; II. \"mixture\" (From th e verbkuka/w \"to mix, stir\"). When Nestor's slave Hekamede is called upon to pr ovide a restorative medicinal drink for her master and the wounded Machaon, sh e brews a kukeiw\\n. An onion and some honey are provided as relish (it is not clear wh ether these are important to the recipe), then she mixes Pramneian wine and sprink les over it goat's cheese and bruised barley meal. The kykeon brewed by Kirke (when she drugs O dysseus' sailors) contains wine, cheese, barley, and honey, and the drugs she adds are said to be in s i/twi, the food or specifically, the grain. This then seems to be a particular and recogniz able drink. The famous reference to kykeon is of course in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter , where the goddess asks for a mixture of water, barley meal and mint (or pennyroyal) because she can not drink wine while mourning her daughter. This is the potion dru nk by initiates preparing for the Eleusinian Mysteries, although Richardson argues that it was merely an invigorating drink and not central to the mysteries, and there is certain ly no reason to argue that it had hallucinogenic or psychotropic qualities as some have suggeste d. Different qualities of the herbs (pennyroyal, or soft mint, is the most popular) added to the kykeon have also been suggested by the various commentaries, but it seems li kely that the perceived invigorating effect is the same as that of Barley Water today. He also obs erves that different types of kykeon are listed in the Hippocratic writings, with various medicinal qualities ascribed to them. It seems safe to say that any specific chemic al effect of the drink would be limited to its refreshing quality in preparing tired initi ates for the important ceremonies to follow. It is unclear whether there is further signif icance to initiates partaking of grain during a ceremony to the goddess of the harvest. A fragment records Herakleitos saying that the kykeon \"disintegrates if it is not stirred\"; this tells us that in his time at least, the kykeon was made up of thick gr ain mixed with water, and not a smooth, porridge-like paste (incidentally, Barley Water also need s to be stirred before drinking). This etymology is interesting in the light of d iscussion on the mixing of herbs; however, in the case of magic drugs (fa/rmaka) it is the co mbination which is significant. These references may give us some clue to the particular use of the k ykeon in h.Cer., which became important as part of the Eleusinian ritual. The kykeon potion that interests us, however, that which Kirke mixes in the Odyssey, seems only to be the refre shing, mixed drink of Homeric epic, which has no ritual attached except perhaps the greeting and feeding of guests at the end of a long journey. It is this which Kirke (Cir ce) feeds to the sailors and then to Odysseus, the difference being the drugs she has se cretly added to it. The Mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis, from around 1500 BCE to the fourth century CE. After Persephone's abduction by Hades, god of the underworld, Demeter left Olympus and vowed never to return, nor to allow crops to grow on earth until she and her daughte r were reunited.

Before Demeter returned to Olympus she instructed the kin gs of Eleusis, Keleos and Triptolemus on how to celebrate the rites in her temple, which were t o be 'Mysteries' (secret teachings). Up to three thousand people were initiated each year - any Greek-speaki ng person who had not committed a murder could present themselves once for initiation . Among those underwent the rite were Aristotle, Sophocles, Plato, Cicero and a numbe r of Roman emperors such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. The celebration of the Myst eries began in the autumn, with four days of rites and festivities in Athens. On the fif th day, a solemn procession to Eleusis began, during which rites, sacrifices and purif ications took place. On the sixth night, cloaked in secrecy, the climax of the Eleusinian cerem ony took place in the inner sanctum of the temple, into which only priests and initiates cou ld enter. \"The initiates often experienced in vision the congruity of the beginni ng and the end, of birth and death, the totality and the eternal generative ground of being.

The possible psychoactive ingredients in kykeon have bee n hotly debated. It has been suggested that the mint in the mixture might have provided the mind-altering element as the mint family contains the plant Salvia divinorum , used by the Mazatec Indians of Mexico in a divinatory context. Terence McKenna has suggested that Stropharia cubensis, or another psilocybin- containing mushroom, might be the key. The most convincing theory about the nature of kykeon, results from extens ive research by Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann and Carl Ruck. In ' The Road to Eleusis ' (2) they argue that the parasitic fungus ergot, found on particular wild grasses, is the ps ychoactive component of kykeon. It would have been simple for an Eleusinian priest to collect the ergot from the wild grass growing near to the temple, grind it into a powder an d add it to the kykeon. The theory is further supported by the fact that ergot is comm only found on grain, Demeter was the goddess of grain, and ears of grain featured prominentl y in the ritual. (Hofmann, A. (1997) The Message of the Eleusinian Mysteries in Forte, R. ( ed.) Entheogens and the Future of Religion . San Francisco: Council on Spiritual Practices.) LSD is a modern product of ergot, providing an intriguing link between the G reek religious rituals of many thousand of years ago, and today's entheogenic explorations. As Albert Hofmann - inventor of LSD and investigator of the Eleusinian Mysteries - pu ts it: \"If the hypothesis that an LSD-like consciousness-altering drug was present in the kykeon is correct - and there are good arguments in its favour - then the Eleusinian Mysteries have a relevance for our time in not only a spiritual-existential sense, but also w ith respect to the question of the controversial use of consciousness-altering compounds to attain mystical insights into the riddle of life\" (1999, Michelle Pauli) An Excerpt from Pharmacotheon (1993) by Jonathan Ott POSTSCRIPTUM: THE SECRET OF THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES UNVEI LED In a most exciting recent development in the study of LSD and other ergolin e entheogens, R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann and Carl A. P. Ruck have advanced the startling new theory concerning the Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece. The th eory was first"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"presented on the morning of Friday, 28 October 1977, at the Second International Conference on Hallucinogenic Mushrooms\" held at Fort Worden, near Port Town send, Washington (I organized this conference; see Chapter 5, Note 11). A full-dre ss presentation followed in May 1978, when these three distinguished scholars publishe d The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of Mysteries (Wasson et al. 1978; Wasson et al. 1980b). Th at the reader may appreciate the significance and meaning of this theory, I w ill review the history of the ancient Mysteries of Eleusis. The Eleusinian Mystery was an annual celebration of a fertility cult, over which the goddess Demeter presided. Anyone speaking Greek could be initiated in to the cult, but only once in a lifetime. The \"Greater Mystery\" was celebrated in the autumn, i n a sanctuary at Eleusis, bordering the Rarian Plain, near Athens. For nearly 2000 years the ann ual celebration was held, but never was the secret of the mystery revealed. I nitiates passed the night together in the darkened telesterion or initiation hall, where t hey beheld a great vision which was \"new, astonishing, inaccessible to rational cognition .\" Of the experience, they could only say that they had seen ta hiera, \"the holy\"--it was forbidden by l aw, under penalty of death, to say anymore (Wasson et al. 1978). Most of our information about the Eleusinian Mystery comes from the so -called Homeric Hymn to Demeter, an anonymous seventh century B.C. poem. The poem describes t he mythical founding of the Mystery by Demeter, who was grief-stricken at the abduction of her daughter Persephone (also called Kore) by the god Hades, of the underworl d. Demeter caused all of the plants on the Earth to die, and fearing humankind would al so die and there would then be nobody to make sacrifices to the gods, interceded wi th Hades, and forced him to return Persephone to Demeter. Persephone, however, had eaten a pomegranate seed in the underworld, and was therefore condemned to r eturn to Hades for part of each year. This always saddened Demeter, who would again cause the plant s to die, to be reborn again in the glory of springtime, with the return of Persephone t o the world of light. The lovely myth symbolized for the Greeks the natural mystery of the changing seasons and the miracle of the springtime rebirth (after burial in the cold Earth) of cultivated grain on which their civilization depended. Demeter ordered the construction of the Eleusinian sanctuary and, re fusing wine, directed the preparation of a special potion, the kykeon (\"mixture\"). The ingredien ts of the kykeon are spelled out in the Homeric Hymn: barley, water and blechon (or glechon , a mint, probably Mentha pulegium, a plant burned as an offering by shamans to Pachama ma in Peru; see Appendix B; Wasson 1967; Wasson 1979). From fragmentary ancient report s, including the remains of a fresco at Pompeii, it is known that initiate s to the Mysteries drank Demeter's potion as a prelude to experiencing a soul-shattering vis ion. The Eleusinian Mysteries were driven into extinction by the Christian s in the fourth century of our era. The \"secret\" was not vouchsafed to us by the Christians, if in fac t they themselves knew it, which is extremely doubtful. Much has been written concerning the Eleusinian Mysteries, but appar ently it had never occurred to anyone before Wasson that the potion, the kykeon, have had something to do with the vision. Classical scholar G.E. Mylonas, for example wrote a detailed book on Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries, and concluded that: \"the act of d rinking the kykeon was one of religious remembrance, of the observance of an act of the Goddess, and i mplied"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"no sacramental mystic significance,\" (Mytonas 1961). Three years before Mylonas made this pronouncement, Wasson had connected Plato's \"ideas\" and world of \" archetypes\" with entheogens (Wasson 1958) and just the year before, Wasson had tentatively sugges ted in a lecture that was subsequently published (Wasson 1961; Wasson 1972d): \"I predict that the secret of the Mysteries will be found in the in doles, whether derived from mushrooms or from higher plants or, as in Mexico, from both.\" This idea w as first suggested by Wasson in a lecture on 15 November 1956, shortly after his experience of mushroomic ecstasy (see Chapter 5). A recent book (T.K McKenna, 1992) wron gly credited Robert Graves with first proposing that the kykeon was entheogenic in 1964 ( see Graves 1957; Graves 1962; for examples of his speculation regarding entheogenic mushroo ms, inspired by his collaboration with the Wassons) A 1936 book published in Fre nch (Felice 1936) first explored the concept of ivresses divines (\"divine inebriati ons,\" obtusely characterized as \"inferior forms\" of mysticism!) and mentioned the El eusinian Mysteries, but advanced no specific theories on the nature of Demeter's potion. With t he elegant and exciting proposal advanced by Wasson, Hofmann and Ruck in 1977-1978, this perspicacious prediction has been placed on a strong and specific scien tific footing. It is the thesis of The Road to Eleusis that Demeter’s potion, the kykeon, was entheogenic, and elicited the ineffable vision experienced by thousands each year. Acc ording to the theory, it was ergot growing on the barley which accounted for the potion's ent heogenic properties. Hofmann argued that by making an aqueous extract of the ergot-infes ted barley, the ancient Greeks could have separated the water-soluble enthe ogenic ergot alkaloids (ergine, ergonovine, etc.) from the non-water-soluble toxic alkaloi ds of the ergotamine/ergotoxine group (Bigwood et al 1979; Hofmann 1978b). Hofmann further suggested that the Eleusinian priests may have employed ergot of the wild grass Paspalum, which produces only the entheogenic alkaloids. Hofmann pointed out that t he psychotropic properties of ergot were known in antiquity, and that such folk knowle dge of these properties lingers in Europe, as evidenced by the names for ergot: Tollkorn (\"mad grain\") and seigle ivre (\"inebriating rye\"; Hofmann 1978a). This simple and elegant theory is buttressed by examination of the rich symbolism attending the cult. Eminent Greek scholar Ruck meticulously showed how the ergot theory fit the available evidence. One of the more telling pieces of evidence is the fact that Demeter was often called Erysibe, \"ergot,\" and that purple, the color of ergot, was her s pecial color. Furthermore, an ear of grain was the symbol of the mystery. Ruck has adduced fu rther evidence in support of the theory presented in the book. He has proposed th at Socrates was executed for profaning the Mysteries by making the kykeon in Athens wi th his disciples, and that Aristophanes escaped legal problems by burying hints of this in Bi rds and Clouds (Ruck 1981). We know from Plutarch that Alcibiades was sentenced to death for the same crime--profaning the Mysteries in Athens. In a paper analyzing Bacchae of Euripides, Ruck later discussed the use of wines in ancient Greece as a vehicle for the ingestion of entheogens and other drugs, and discu ssed the \"cultivated\" (grain and civilization) versus the \"wild\" (ergot, thought to r epresent the degeneration of cultivated grain to its wild precursor; Ruck 1982). This fasc inating study illuminates some linguistic curiosities of the Bible, in which \"w ine\" (yayin in Hebrew) is repeatedly compared and contrasted with \"strong drink\" (sheker in Hebrew), evidently an"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"entheogenic potion (Ruck 1982; Wasson 1914). Finally, Ruck identified the Hyperbor eans as Aryans, and proposed that their first-fruit offerings were none other t han the miraculous soma—entheogenic mushrooms (see Chapter 6; Ruck 1983). The amr ta, the Soma potion, is etymologically identical to the Greek ambrosia, which we no w know, thanks to Ruck, Hofmann and Wasson to have been an entheogenic potion. Hofmann has often described the \"magic circle\" of his research on enth eogens starting with the discovery of LSD, a derivative of ergot alkaloids, he was later brought in to contact with R. Gordon Wasson, who supplied him with the sacred mushrooms of Me xico, leading to Hofmann's discovery of psilocybine and psilocyline, and who then suppli ed him with ololiuhqui, another Mexican sacred durg in which Hofmann found the same alkaloids he had begun working with two decades earlier (Hofmann 1966; Hofmann 1967). Now it appears that Hofman’s \"magic circle\" has undergone a second revolution, again lead ing back to ergot, a sacred drug of ancient Greek culture, which is unmistakabl y our own, IndoEuropean culture.

DIALOGUE WITH DEMETER/PERSEPHONE These are vulnerable goddesses more like Hera in consciousness than t he virgin-goddesses Artemis, Athena or Hestia. In contrast to the focused consciousness of th e virgins, these goddesses are typified by \"diffuse awareness,\" which can be describ ed as \"an attitude of acceptance, an awareness of the unity of life, and a readiness for relationship .\" This quality of consciousness typifies the relationship-oriented p eople of both sexes. Diffuse awareness allows the mother to maintain awareness of her children even wh en they aren't in her immediate presence, and enables a wife to known when her husban d is upset. Negatively this means she can be easily distracted by others. Try to notice wh en you experience this type of awareness over focused consciousness. Unfortunately the vulnerable goddesses were also subject to victimizati on or abuse. When have you been victimized or had an uninvited intrusion? Jung has said, that what is unconscious comes to us as fate. When has fate opened a chasm in your life, and dragge d you into the underworld? How did your state of consciousness contribute to this event? Those who feel unprotected will have frequent anxiety dreams of hostil e, aggressive, or threatening men. It is characteristic of the Demeter/Persephone p ersonality to have a happy or fulfilled phase, a phase during which she is victimized, suf fers and is symptomatic, and a phase of restoration or transformation. A susceptible pe rsonality can learn to predict its own problems and save some suffering. They gain balanc e through learning judgment and independence. How have these cycles unfolded in your life? The main psychological issues here are victimization, power and control, expr ession of anger, depression, and possible lapse into a psychotic breakdown. An exaggerat ed need to nurture can also lead to \"burnout,\" fatigue and apathy. Exploitation due to lack of personal assertiveness can lead to passive-aggressive reactions, which appe ar as forgetfulness or lack of responsibility. Then we should \"mother\" ou rselves, giving our concern to our own well-being. If we are too passive and compliant we are domin ated by other, and need more self-determination.

We see this today in the obsessive loner techno-geek type. Hephaistos was born of Hera alone. Some ancient authors say Hera invented the legend of his virgin birth because he was conceived before her marriage to Zeus. O thers claim that he was conceived from Hera's brooding over Zeus' creation of Athena. Since He phaistos is credited with striking the blow which released Athena from the c ranium of Zeus, this account seems confused. Yet, the mythic dimension is non-linear. So when we compare accounts of exploits, there are discrepancies and variations on the theme fr om different regions and times. Whether Zeus fathered Hephaistos or not, he rejected him forthwith. In one version, Hera abandoned him also, hurling her lame son into the sea from Olympian height s. This rejection and abandonment led him to judge himself as \"imperfect\" an d his compensation was to achieve technological perfection through his work. Hephaistos was born with a birth defect; he was lame and twisted, and on ly learned to walk with great difficulty. His appearance disgusted Hera, and she tried to hid e him from the Immortals. He was raised by sea nymphs until the age of nine, when he made his existence known to the Olympians. Already an artistically gifted inventor, Hephaistos sent Hera a beautiful th rone he made for her as a present. He was not only a craftsman, but a crafty individual--the thron e concealed a trap for his mother. Hephaistos came back to Olympus on his own terms, deman ding to know the secret of his birth and seeking the beautiful Aphrodite as his bride. Hera's heart softened when she saw her son, and she tempered her atti tude toward him. But Zeus never accepted him for how could he claim the imperfect as h is own creation? Hephaistos always took his mother's side when they fought. Seeking to preven t Zeus from beating his mother, another tale recounts how Zeus hurled Hephaistos d own to earth. He landed, half-dead, in the island of Lemnos where he was cared for by a guild of dwarfish miners and metal-workers. Here he took on his nature as the god of \"earthy\" fire. His name is said to mean 'f ire' or ruler of fire. Other than the metaphor which associates him with light ning, he is distinguished from the celestial fire of Zeus. Earthy fire promote s civilization by giving us the ability to work metals. Hephaistos thus became the archetypal blacks mith, characterized by his powerful upper body and the quality of his artis tic and mechanical creations. In ancient Greece it was customary for lame men to become sm iths. Hephaistos kindles within us his own primordial desire. His creat ive hand is \"trying to grasp,\" both in the physiological and psychological sense. He tries to grasp h is mother's abandonment, his father's rejection, and his own deformed nature. He r epresents man as the tool user, equipped with an opposable thumb. It is the ability of th e creative hand to grasp which links Hephaistos with Trump IX, THE HERMIT, which cor responds with the Hebrew letter Yod, which means \"the hand,\" --specifically the cre ative hand. There are numerous ancient connections between Hephaistos and the pr e-Olympian Great Mother. Psychologically, this links the subterranean fire of the smith- God with the dark,"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"internal energies of the Mother's creativity. He can't produce babies, s o he copies the creativity of nature and produces things carefully wrought by hand. Some Jungians note that Hephaistian fire takes its light and energy from t he central fires which are at the heart of nature's creativity. Therefore, Hephaistos is a sp lit-off animus of the Great Mother. He \"mimics\" the creative processes in the depth s of the Mother and brings his works of art to birth by technological means. Even though he lacked physical symmetry and personal grace, his inventive spi rit found an area in which he could excel--the working of metals. He is characterist ically depicted as grasping his hammer and tongs in his hands, ready to work and temper the raw metal. There was a STAR TREK NG episode where the android Data has a vision of his creator, Dr. Sung, forging a bird's wing. Data comes to realize that \"he is the bird,\" and his imagination takes flight as he claims another level of his inheritance. Hephaistos was a prolific artist, creating artifact after artifact of great p recision and beauty. Many appealed to him for his services. Even the haughty Zeus came to hi m for help in punishing Prometheus and men for the crime of stealing the celest ial fire--consciousness. Zeus commissioned Hephaistos to create the body of the first woman from water and clay, taking care to make her a resplendent beauty. Zeus breathed life into her . Pandora, a human-sized Great Mother with her magic box of evils, misery, suffering, an d disease was loosed on the world. The woes of physical life come along with corporeal existen ce. This myth about the origins of corporeal life coming from clay has been confirm ed by modern science. It is more than a metaphor. In 1985, NASA scientists showed that clay gives off life-promoting bursts of ultraviolet radiation. It literally stimu lates the growth of organic molecules. Some clays respond likewise when exposed to gamma radiati on. This discovery led to the proposal of a new theory of human origins--that we are th e fruit of the soil. Other theories begin with \"primordial soup\" or interstel lar \"seeding.\" Yet, ordinary clay acts like a chemical factory by storing and transmitting energy. It c an transform inorganic raw materials into more complex molecules from wh ich life arises. In Genesis, Adam is formed of the \"dust\" of the earth. Despite his own deformity and imperfection, or more likely because of it, Hephaistos yearned for pleasures and aesthetic beauty. Therefore, he sought and won the h and of Aphrodite. Their marriage symbolized his addiction to pleasures of beau ty, even though she cheated on him. He also lusted after Athena, but again the pattern of his rejection prevailed, revealing his faulty anima relationship. As a result of his continual rejection, he is severely complexed. He has an unconscious longing to reunite with his mother in an incestuous relationship. Thi s in is fact what cripples him -- his untransformed desire to return to the comfort ing bosom of his Great Mother. Thus he fluctuates radically between lust and guilt. He would gi ve too much to mother by serving her in a materialistic manner. He is too pragmatic for his own good. For her he rejects (as he was rejected) lofty abstractions and the imper sonal fantasy world of the spiritual father principle. He takes refuge in the mother's realm of matter"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"(mater=matter). Really, he seeks the spiritual transformation both of hi s body, and by indirection, all matter. He seeks what he didn't have--a father. As the projection of Hera's inner masculinity, he embodies the process of change or psychic transform ation in his twisted, paradoxical body, which is half maimed, half robust. He has the introverted personality of a cripple. His lame foot reflects hi s mother-complexed soul and his spirit's structural damage. Unlike the \"handicapable,\" his spirit is where he is truly crippled. He is a son with an absent, rejecting father. Therefore, h e vows to remain earthy, the very salt of the earth, with no celestial traits or aspirations. He must turn inward to hidden resources for comfort. In his introvers ion, he is always willing to go to the depths of the unconscious (realm of the Great Mother) . He feels comfortable and \"at home\" in subterranean depths of the subconscious. S ince he had to be self-sustaining, he learned to prefer solitude, and is somewhat withdr awn and remote. His underground fire smolders with unresolved resentments. So, as well as the physical representations like mechanics and technol ogy, Hephaistos is with us in such expressions as introversion, depression, union activity, an d Marxist philosophy. Perhaps, most psychologically interesting, he is the motivatin g force behind the transformative processes of alchemy, which are steeped in cryptic prot ocols. Hephaistos, like THE HERMIT, seeks his illumination from within. Th e secret impulse emerges as a vision which he holds to its manifestation in reality. It is a prac tical philosophy based on what works. His is one archetypal means of executing one 's Will. Wisdom, prudence, and circumspection guide the will. He is fertile i n his own particular way, which in its ultimate sense manifests as the fulfillment of TH E GREAT WORK. He shares the alchemical world (the mysteries of life) and goals with Merc ury, or Hermes. Prometheus stole fire from the gods -- the fire of technological or sci entific knowledge. For this infraction he was chained to a mountain and his liver was pecked at for a seeming eternity. We see it in the growing pangs of the digital revolution: \" We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.

These unforeseen or ignored consequences are his pathologies played out in matter. He is the evolutionary anomaly, technological man. Just as the Great Mother preve nts spiritual possibilities from emerging, so has our cultural bias for tech nology at any price banished the philosopher from certain areas of knowledge.

This is his creative effort channeled into producing the deadly machinery of war, though he tends to shy away from conflict, unlike his brother Ares. Hephaistos forms a politi co-economic conspiracy with Hera, and his combative brother Ares, and Hera's overachieving h ero, Hercules. They seek to dominate through force, inadvertently serving yet su ccumbing to the patriarchy of Zeus. Technological man has extracted the secret of atomic bonds from matter. When a nuclear bomb explodes, the energy (E) locked in the mass (m) radiates at enormous s peed (C2). Conventional war has traditionally been considered \"good\" for business, but t his is obviously not the case with nuclear war. But for years the \"nuclear threat\" has been big business--the so-called defense business, (offense business) . Another toxic example of the Hephaistian shadow is the greenhouse effe ct, the result of the burning of fossil fuel. Pollution ranges from the drilling site to the refinery, to the milling of steel for cars, which create 20% of the excess carbon dioxide in the atmospher e. This canopy traps heat. Carbon dioxide molecules trap infrared waves which would otherwise radiate back into space from the earth. Other graphic cases of Hephaestian mimicry may be found in the fields of biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Fundamental to all these is the science of chemistry which is directly descended from the psycho-physical science of alc hemy. If the physical archetype for Hera is the principle of molecular bonding, the Hephaestian chemist seeks to delve into his mother's deepest secrets. At the same time he seek s spiritual fathering by seeking recognition for his work. The biochemist literally imitates hi s mother by aping nature's creative process in research on recombinate DNA. In ancient times, Hephaestos's creations were praised for being so \"li fe-like.\" Today, biopolymers like DNA (genetic substance) can be synthesized by thes e scientists at will. They may be manipulated in many ways for the desired result. We are on the verge of hybridizing our vegetables with fish genes, and other weird genetic a malgamations. Thus, the biochemist produces his offspring as a single-parent, through a \"virgin \" birth, much as Hera conceived Hephaestos. Through a process known as parthenogenesis, a female may produce offspri ng alone, but this child is invariably female. This shows the self-generating power of the Great Mother."},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"Physically, this power is represented in our human bodies by plasmids. Pl asmids are bits of genetic substance which float freely outside of the main genetic reposi tory. They are transmitted to any one individual through the mother only. They are donated s trictly from the egg. Thus, plasmids come only through the matrilinear line of descent . In unisex reproduction, exactly the same genetic information is passed to e ach daughter cell, or clone. No fresh characteristics can be inherited. Through techn ology, almost any gene--from a virus to a frog to a man--could be spliced into a plasmid. It is th en inserted into an E. coli bacterium, and the transplanted DNA is copied down to the m inutest detail. Any product ordered by the inserted genes will occur in the offspring. Thus bacterium are created, such as interferon, and oil-digesting enzymes. Recently fertility hormones have been cloned, also. Recombinant DNA has pr oduced two human fertility hormones. The hormones are polypeptide chains which m ust have sugars added to them in order for the hormone to be biologically active. Bacteria can't produce these, so molecular biologists have \"grown\" them in mammalian cells. These clones tend to be unstable, creating defects in replication, forming an archetype of impe rfection. Another echo of Hephaistos in science is the newest advanced weapons sys tem being created around super ceramics. Remember how he created Pandora of wate r and clay? Well, ceramics are neither organic substances nor metals. They are formed of many materials, 90% of which comes from the earth's crust. They are even str onger than metals in many cases, because of unique bonding at the atomic level. Other unique inventions include a new class of metals with the str ucture of glass, known as \"metallic glasses.\" Even more amazing are the biochip implants being deve loped known as nanochips. These are biologically-based computer chips formed of living ti ssues which would be infinitely faster than today's silicon chips. Nanotechnology is a new area being developed which makes use of extremely small robotic assemblers, small enough to manipulate not only molecules, but atoms. This is opening up an entire new era in engineering at the subatomic level. The current goal i s to build \"nanites\" which can reproduce themselves--assemblers of assembl ers. In ENGINES OF CREATION , Drexler outlines many of the possible implications of this fantastic sc ientific horizon, in health care, weapons, communications, space travel, etc. Technology is also working at creating a world of its own--VIRTUAL REALITY. Th ese computer-generated simulations, much like the Holodeck on Startrek , create a universe where the programmer is essentially a god within that world, as far as exe cuting wishes which would be unattainable in consensus reality. Uses range from a sim ple extrapolation of video games to therapeutic application, to virtual sex. Controversy already exist s about the possible addictive quality of cyberspace over consensus reality. For technology, \"everything is made of materials;\" matter or atoms or livin g tissues have just become building blocks or components for technological man. We can syn thesize most of what Mother nature has made, and are now attempting to create organic compute rs which could not only plug into the brain, but also copy it. Organic polymers are ca rbon- based conductors of electricity which could create the \"Holy Grail\" of sc ience, the ultimate"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"chip. But despite all the efforts to instill life into these units, w ill they be anymore than soulless robots? Science has a rigid, though paradoxical, profile. Technological man is obsessed with time, work, order, limits, learning, history, continuity, survival and endurance. But at the same time he has a phallic drive to inquire, quest, chase, search, and transgress al l of nature's limits. This is his pathos, his yearning for that which can never be full y recovered. According to R. Buckminster Fuller, technology models principles from science. A scientific principle becomes technology when someone invents a use for it. Therefore, technology is the popularization of science. It creates gadgets which bring m ysterious principles into everyday experience. Hephaestus can also be imagined in the discarded tissues of stem cell research. The promise and perils of stem cell research have become one of medicine's great hopes, and one of science's greatest political and ethical dilemmas. But often lost und erneath the arguments over the promise and peril of stem cell research are nuances that don't f it with all the drama. Despite a growing body of research, no one is sure whether these cell s, once taken out of the lab and turned into medical treatments, will match expectations . Stem cells, in their ability to morph into hundreds of different body t issues, have challenged a central truism of medicine: Organs can't regenerate the mselves. A growing body of research supports the tantalizing potential of these cells to cre ate tissue and build organs. Recent studies have found the ability for the cells to form everyth ing from new blood vessels to brain tissue. All 75 trillion cells in the human body originat e from stem cells -- unspecialized master cells that mature into specialized cells, or renew cells that die or become damaged. If these cells could be harnessed in the lab, perhaps they could be emp loyed to help repair the body by renewing damaged tissues in severe disease and injury. Kinds of stem cells include embryonic stem cells, and adult stem cells. Startling progress in using embryonic stem cells has been used to create blood vessels, blood-forming cells, b rain cells, pancreatic cells, spinal tissue; adult cells have created heart muscle tissu e and blood vessels. Other hurdles are yet to be overcome. Scientists still need to learn how cell s make their choices to become a specific organ or piece of tissue. In \"A Dim View of a `Posthuman Future\" By Nicholas Wade, (2002), the human mind an d body are shaped by a bunch of genes, as the decoding of the human genome seems to underscore. Biotechnologists will one day be able to change both and perhap s, in seeking to refine the imperfect human clay, will alter human nature. That prospect should be worrying a lot more people, in the view of the political theorist Francis Fuk uyama, because history's central question \"that of what kind of society best suits h uman needs\" has been settled only if human nature remains as it is, warts and all. Dr. Fukuyama, now at the Washington campus of Johns Hopkins University, is known for his widely discussed book \" The End of History and the Last Man ,\" published in 1992, a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In it he argued that with the demis e of communism, liberal democracy had emerged without rival as a political system with uni versal appeal. The challengers of this tempting thesis included Samuel P. Huntin gton of Harvard, who"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"argued that struggles between the world's major cultural groups would pre dominate in a post-Communist world. In his book, \" Our Posthuman Future ,\" he explores the ways in which biotechnology may change the human essence. Despite his title, Dr. Fukuyama has no taste for a re run of history and believes a posthuman future is one to avoid. The danger is the greate r because those closest to the action, scientists and bioethicists, cannot in hi s view be trusted to raise the alarm. Scientists are interested in conquering nature while many b ioethicists, Dr. Fukuyama contends, \"have become nothing more than sophisticated and sophis tic justifiers of whatever it is the scientific community wants to do.\" H is views are not academic; he has an official voice on such matters as a member of the White Hou se's Council on Bioethics. Genetic engineering of the human germline, making permanent changes t o the genes in the egg or sperm, would pose the most direct threat to human nature but othe r techniques bear watching, in his view. Mood changing drugs could change society if taken wide ly enough, and Dr. Fukuyama says he wonders whether Caesar or Napoleon would have felt the ne ed to conquer Europe if either had been able to pop a Prozac tablet occasionally. Major increases in human longevity could also be disruptive, he fears, becau se \"life extension will wreak havoc with most existing age-graded hierarchies,\" p ostponing social change in countries with aging dictators and thwarting innovation in others. B ut the most serious threat to the stability of human societies is genetic engine ering that may alter, by design or inadvertence, the special balance of contrarieties of human natu re. Human nature, Dr. Fukuyama argues, \"is fundamental to our notions of justice, morali ty and the good life.\" By messing with the human genome in order to enhance intelligence or ph ysique or other desirable qualities, biotechnology may cause us \"to lose our humanity” that is, s ome essential quality that has always underpinned our sense of who we are and where we are going,\" he writes. Science has had many critics, but Dr. Fukuyama's warnings c ome from an unusual direction. His father, Yoshio, a sociologist of religion, was an Amer ican of Japanese descent who escaped internment in World War II, unlike several oth er members of his family. Francis grew up in New York, not much exposed to Japanese cultur e, studying classics at Cornell and political science at Harvard. He spent the first part of his career as a Sovietologist at RAND Corporation, t he research group, and in between stints at RAND, he worked at the State Department. It was in listening to a speech by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that Dr. Fuk uyama had the idea for his first book. Hegel, the 19th-century German philosopher, bel ieved history would culminate in a constitutional state or, in modern terms, a liberal democrac y, whereas Marx saw a communist state as the likely end point. Hearing Mr. Gorbachev declare surprisingly in a speech one day that the essence of socialism was competition, Dr. Fukuyam a recalled in an interview, \"I called up a friend and said if Gorbachev was saying that, th is is the end of history,\" meaning that Hegel's prediction had triumphed over Marx's. Dr. Fukuyama's only expectation of the book he then wrote was that \"my political t heorist friends would be vaguely amused.\" But \" The End of History \" was too powerful and hopeful"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"a guide to the post-Communist world to be ignored. He argued that history was n ot a meaningless cycle but had a direction imposed on it by the logic of modern sc ience, a direction that \"would seem to dictate a universal evolution in the direc tion of capitalism.\" Though the advanced industrialization made possible by science and techn ology does not necessarily lead to political liberty, Dr. Fukuyama wrote, the human desire for recognition, cited by Hegel as the driving force of history, is best satisfied in a liber al democracy. Though religion and culture can impede modernization, Dr. Fukuyama sees no reason to suppose that the Islamic and other civilizations will not in time adopt t heir own versions of liberal democracy. \"The basic structure of world politics continues to b e the juggernaut of modernization as pioneered by the West,\" he says. The optimism about science that imbues \" The End of History \" is strikingly absent from \" Our Posthuman Future .\" Scientists' responsible record of self-regulation is now too undermined by comme rcial ties to biotechnology companies for the same disinterested behavior to be counte d on. Science and technology gave history its forward direction for the last 500 years, he s ays, but it is much less certain that biotechnology will be handled with the same wisdom as previous innovations. Dr. Fukuyama says he believes some things should be ban ned outright, like cloning people, which he regards as immoral in itself and as the opener for worse things, like enhancing human qualities by germline genetic engi neering. Dr. Fukuyama plans to devote the next few years to studying how biotechnology should be regulated.

The 'volcanic' psychological types combines t he functions of sensation and feeling. A graphic example of this primal combination of the fiery furnace and testosterone happened to an art historian friend of mine in Malta when he inadvertently found himself caught in what I have come to call an \"archet ypal storm,\" showing how primal these emotions can be. This scene in its primitive setting is essentially unchanged from that of 1000 B.C. In the heat, the sweat, the dirt, and the fire blat antly Hephaistos reveals his primitive essence: \" It reminded me of the experience I had a few months ago while talking technical m atters over with a Maltese forger (bronze casting), a not unhandsome fellow with a torn trouser leg which gave a clear view of his tightly fitting jockey shorts. Behind him s tood his Arab (?) assistant wrapped in cloths that would have made Charles Dickens falter at des cribing a shirt taken from a Caravaggio regatzzo (sp?) and a sort of wrap around trouser skirt held together with the largest safety pin I've seen outside the circus. He sat behind th e Maestro while listening to the conversation which had to be translated to him. \" I haven't the slightest idea of the origin of the behavior, even though I am a psyc hologist (of sorts) but the fellow started playing with himself and actually succeeded i n \"coming off\" twice in thirty minutes while never taking his eyes off me. I don't know whe ther the Maestro knew what was going on or not, but in true well-bred Boston fashion I made out that noth ing was \"going on\". The odor of this Ishmaelic semen reached me at three yards so I can only as sume that Maestro was aware....which in true psychoanalytic fashion verified the reports I've frequently heard that iron and other metal mongers are notoriously viri le. Well, this need for a non-participating, Clinton-like audience for one's sexual display is a metaphor for Bob's literary style .\" (Henrickson, 2002). Earthy Hephaistos is the god of the pragmatic working-class man. As such, he pr omotes the work ethic and unions. As god of the proletariat, he exemplifies the theme , \"local boy makes good.\" He is the archetypal self-made man. He also inhabits the now- outworn myth of the Marxist world, which tried to make a philosophy of materialism. The p ostmodern version of the proletariat society is cyberculture. Emotionally, he is introverted, even emotionally crippled from rejectio n. He is a slow, steady, internal rhythm which allows attention to turn in to subjective states of consciousness. He can be asocial and prefers solitude, being somewhat of a her mit. He doesn't handle interpersonal relationships well, so he throws himse lf into him work. He appears gauche, childish, or awkward in social situations. He can be uncomm unicative or display his anxiety neurosis and over-sensitivity. His overwork produces c hronic fatigue. Rage turned inward may lead to depression or numbing out. Reparenting can hel p. Hephaistos' introversion doesn't necessarily mean he is shy, but he is d efinitely introspective. This introspective quality is intimately related to hi s ability to visualize his artistic inspiration. He must be self-sustaining and tends to get cre ative rather than bored. The Hephaistian temperament is found in artists and craftsmen, those who live on income from their beautiful productions, and those who live by utilitarian trades such as mechanics, machinists, and welders. Those who are preoccupied in w ork with their hands,"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"with earthy, concrete manifestations are also under him. Occupational the rapy and practical, empirical, functional-art producers of all sorts are under hi s patronage. Hephaistos is not a slender, effeminate artiste, though. He is a robust sp ecimen of his gender, epitomized as the stereotypical hardhat worker. As patron of the b luecollar class, he embodies the restless volcanic spirit which leads workers to stri ke against the tyrannical rule of their employers. In an industrial society, Hephaistos is embodie d in the solidarity of unions. If hardhats can be characterized as \"hardworking and hard-drinking\" we m ight remember the close affinity between Hepaistos and Dionysus, god of int oxication. Dionysus and his wine brings the relief and solace of drunkenness to Hephaist os, freeing him from his normal inhibitions. But he cannot hold his liquor. His fires are loosed as he seeks incestuous union with both the creative and destructive energie s of the Great Mother. Thus intoxication can be healing or poisonous to the Hephaestian temperament. He may regressively seek to dissolve in the unconscious depths, annulling his rejection and abandonment by his parents. Technology is also planning a carefully orchestrated intervention here, givi ng new meanings to \"intoxication.\" Soon science will be able to alter genes throu gh genetic engineering to change human behavior. But, it will remain difficult for gen etic intervention to reach a degree of sophistication where it can produce results as expec ted. Since every individual is unique, this tampering with embryos contains a great deal of uncertainty. The more likely route is that more mood- and behavior-altering drugs will be tailored by pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is easier and more reliable to inte rvene with drug therapy than genetic manipulation of embryos. This is an extremely cont roversial area of genetic engineering. This research verges on being seen by some as a contemp orary taboo. Technology is in the process of developing new drugs which will have psych o-social uses, for example enhancing personality in such areas as sociability, kindness, s ensitivity, cleverness, etc. To gain any wide acceptance, these drugs will have to be fre e of alarming side effects, such as those associated with today's black-market drugs. So, any mass-brainwashing through genetic manipulation is unlikely, but pop ulations may also be controlled through emotions by programming and doctrinaire philosop hies, such as that of Marx. The Marxist myth was based on its own archetypal perspective of li fe, which held the vision of a paradisical future. Marx, himself, was heavily influence d by the German philosopher, Hegel. Hegel's concept of \"thesis, antithesis, and synthesis\" carries on in the tradition of the Christian Trinity, which echoed Plato's and P ythagoras's thought on the \"three-in-one.\" Marx felt that human history transformed through this process. Project ing this idea into the future of mankind, Marx came up with a vision strikingly similar to th e Christian version. Its major theme states that after an apocalyptic revolution (antit hesis), world citizens inhabit a worker's paradise free of oppression by a powerful eli te. The workers are the \"chosen people,\" forming an ideal, classless society. In practice th is was hardly accurate."},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"How a new social order arises on the ruins of the old is a recurrent Biblical theme, where the Jews, or the \"saved\" are the chosen who will inhabit the utopian world (synthesis). Thus the proletariat and the \"reborn\" have dreams with a common theme. Both share a fundamentalist work ethic; both seek to overcome that which they consid er \"evil.\" History has shown that Marxists can be as orthodox in their stance as any religious ind ividual. The shared apocalyptic element of the vision of the world's superpowers was a f rightening omen, which has hopefully been averted.

Even though Hephaistos is mother-complexed by his mother's rejecti on and desertion of him, he makes the best of his adversity. Even after he tried to help Her a defend herself against the onslaughts of Zeus, she still tried to do away with her deforme d son. She despised him, perhaps because he reminded her of her secret inner imperfections, which he embodied in matter. When spirit becomes \"grounded\" after falling to the earth, it is impel led to drag itself around by limping. But laming can be an advantage or foreshadow achievement and transformation, as it does for shamans in primal cultures. This tribal the me is re-emerging in technological society as we seek to heal our wounded souls. Hephaistos le arns things from his inner self, and develops an interior strength and self-relian ce. By exploring his heart and mind he contacts that spirit which is uniquely his own. He gets pleasure from this inner life. He gains inspiration from being alone in nature. While Hephaistos is centered, he isn't necessarily stable. He tries to compensate--but over- compensates--for his sense of rejection through megalomania. Only alchem y represents \"one-footedness\" as an accomplishment. But it doesn't feel like one to the individual stuck in this pattern--he feels self-conscious of his hindrance. He tri es to overcome his frustration through his creativity, or inward-turning libido through fantasy. Destiny has limited his mobility, but not his imagination. His immobilit y binds him to the archetypal realm forever. His need for a crutch seems to have provided him w ith \"something to lean on.\" Laming also symbolizes the weakness or helplessness of any new enterprise. Will it stand or fall? Only time will tell. Initial difficu lties may be overcome through industry or hard work. Looking for Hephaistos' pattern in a historical context, we find that in th e industrial revolution of the 1800s there was an epidemic of negligent and deliberate i nfanticide due to crowded living conditions and severely limited resources in cities . So many children were being abandoned and left to die of exposure that the English Parliament set up foundling hospitals with revolving boxes in the walls so the abandoning parents could r emain anonymous. Due to the financial burden this presented the burgeoning i ndustrial state, 80 - 90% of these children were allowed to die before they were one year old, esp ecially if they were crippled or deformed, like the mythic role-model. The standard of living didn't rise even when infant mortality rates dr opped in later years. Children were valued and helped to survive infancy solely for the labor th ey could provide in factories, before they succumbed to tuberculosis as adolescents. Thi s era also gave rise to the philosophical economic theories of Malthus and Marx, who may be characteri zed as obsessed with the laws of reproduction and production. In every era pri or to the development of rudimentary birth control methods, an increase in techn ological change also brought a period of rapid population growth which kept the standard of l iving approximately the same from medieval to industrial times."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"The fossil fuel revolution (remember, Hephaistos = petroleum) brought a s ubstantial increase in labor productivity in such areas as agriculture, mining, and tran sport. The enormous supply of cheap energy extracted from the inner resources of t he earth brought an intensification of production never seen before. But since coal and oil are stored, rather than renewable resources, we now face depletion of reserves, declinin g efficiency, and the threat of a lowered standard of living. Now it takes more and more money to ext ract less and less fossil fuel. As profits decline, we must seek alternative s ources of energy. It has been calculated that if the rest of the world used energy like the U.S., wor ld reserves would be exhausted in only 11 years. Therefore industry must move in the direct ion of \"making more from less\" (as Fuller suggested decades ago) to satisfy world marke ts. Psychologically, on the individual level, a man dominated by the Hephaistian patte rn exhibits the moodiness of a social outcast. He has mood swings which alternate between depression and ego inflation. He enjoys creativity and the company of women, but h is love affairs unfortunately end in disappointment most of the time. Per haps he doesn't know how to truly love a woman because he was denied a warm relationship with his m other. Her desertion remains his wound, and keeps him insecure about his p ersonal worth. He is mentally crippled by his anguish, but he compensates with an active inner life of fantasy or career success. In a woman's psychology, Hephaistos may be the motivation for substituting art or w ork for a personal experience of the woman's mysteries of blood-kinship and b irth (or childrearing). This doesn't mean that every woman who opts for employment r ather than breeding is an emotional cripple, but she does carry this as an active compon ent of her personality. It may manifest as a nagging criticism or guilt, in moments of int rospection. Her feminine naturalism may mourn for an unborn child, and is the pers pective which considers her productivity rather than reproductivity as monstrous or of fensive. Cyberculture is an excellent example of the philosophy of the Hephaest us point of view. In fact, it may represent the mythically abortive rape attempt of Hephaestus on Athena -- now united in Cyber-culture. The culture that has formed among those who u se the Internet and other networks to communicate through multimedia, and have formed social groups which meet and interact online and may never meet in real life. Cybercul ture has its own customs, etiquette, mythology, and ethics. It has its own science, expres sed as semiotics, CTheory, and other buzz-words of New Media. Cyberculture is broad. It exists within and extends throughout the Int ernet, the global, computer-based \"network of networks\" constructed in the 1960s by the Un ited States Department of Defense.(1) Although cyberculture is made possible by t he network's wires, cables, servers, and terminals, it thrives where users meet within t he wires and upon the interfaces. These online social interactions, or what Allucquere Rosan ne Stone calls \"virtual systems,\" are as broad as they are diverse and take place within basic email, newsgroups, reflectors, and listserves, bulletin board systems (BBS s) and Usenet, MOOs and MUDs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), electronic chat rooms, and interact ive sites on the World Wide Web. Cyberculture is deep. Although it can be as shallow as a single unanswered email, it is often a product of complex and collaborative communicative practices which take pl ace over"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"varying segments of time and \"space.\" Indeed, within a particularly healthy li stserve thread or MOO space or collaborative Website exists dynamic interactions, s ocial constructions, political negotiations, sexual posturing, and institutional h istories. Like its in real life (IRL) counterpart, cyberculture resembles a collection of m ini-villages, replete with the village idiot, the sage, the argumentative curmudgeon, the idealisti c student, and the den mother, not to mention the town hall, the playground, the shopping m all, and back alley. Cyberculture is in a constant state of flux. Of course, what we call cybercul ture today may not exist tomorrow. Like other new technologies, computer-mediated comm unication technologies are evolving at an incredible rate. As mainstream America, not t o mention the world as a whole, continues to embrace and integrate basic Internet techn ologies into their personal and business lives, we can expect even more innovations. Thus, jus t as email and listservs dominated the Net from its induction and through the 1980s, Gop her altered organizational structures in the early 1990s, and Web browsers such as Mosaic, Net scape, and Internet Explorer completely transformed the Net from a text-bas ed platform to one incorporating various types of media, so too can we expect new and dynamic techn ological advances to redefine what we call the Net. More importantly, we can expect or iginal individual and collective applications of those developments to reinvent what we think of as cyberculture. Cyberculture is broad, deep, and in a constant state of flux. Assuming this is true what hopes can we hold for understanding what cyberculture is, locating its bou ndaries, and determining its characteristics? Before we get intimidated by such a d aunting task, we must keep in mind that in many ways these are the same questions facing ot her, more traditional students of culture such as anthropologists and sociologists. After all, all cultures are broad, deep, and in a constant state of flux. Significantly, it is much easier to put forth a number of dimensions of cybe rculture than a single definition of it. Too often, the term is used to describe contemp orary cultures and/or cultural products that have some relationship with technology. For examp le, in his book entitled Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century, w riter Mark Dery conflates cyberculture with \"computer-age subcultures.\"(2) Alt hough Dery's book explores interesting issues surrounding Internet identities and communi ties, it also includes chapters on Mark Pauline and Survival Research Labs and tribal tattoo artists. While the book is interesting, it is difficult to ascertain what is cyber about tribal tat tos. Cyberculture is a collection of cultures and cultural products that exi st on and/or are made possible by the Internet, along with the stories told about these cultur es and cultural products. Thus, while Dery uses cyberculture to mean computer-age s ubcultures, I use the term to refer to culture and cultural products that are directly lin ked to not only computers but, more specifically, the Internet. One way to better understand cyberculture is to examine its many eleme nts individually. Some facets, including issues of electronic democracy, telecommuting, an d the perennial favorite, virtual sex, have become popular topics in the popular media. Other el ements such as cyberspace and race, online representations of gender and sexuality, an d the political economy of cyberculture are beginning to be addressed by the popu lar media and"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"within academic circles. Yet in a feeble attempt to impose a boundary ( dare I use the term \"containment\" with respect to a topic so utterly containless?), I have deci ded to explore cyberculture in terms of four categories. These categories include cyberculture in context, virtual communities, community networks, and virtual identities. (1996-1997, D avid Silver). When Cyberculture and globalization converge, we see again Hephaistos and Athen a. In Global Cyberculture Reconsidered: Cyberspace, Identity, and the Global Informa tional City , Martin Irvine Director, Communication, Culture, and Technology Program an d Associate Vice President for Technology Strategy , Georgetown University says: Talking about cyberculture usually means rounding up the usual suspec ts: adolescents of all ages living out Neuromancer fantasies; online identity morphing in MUD s and chat spaces; virtual communities sustained by Net communication; fascinat ion with cyborg theory and cybersexualities on college campuses and underground websit es; magazines like Mondo 2000, Wired and 21.C; speculative and cyberpunk fiction with a finger on fast forward; the global market for multimedia information and entertainment ; and the large group of artists, writers, and philosophers who find the Net environment the most interesting place to play, live, think, and create. Cyberculture has an array of recognized contexts and positions--utopian, dystop ian, ironic, postmodern, identity-political, and market-driven opportunist--but t hese aren't the issues that interest me here. I'd like to disturb the shared, consensual h allucination of cyberculture by thinking about the material conditions of the matrix, sp ecifically the function of imagined communities and the underlying infrastructure of cyberspace in the global informational city. Global cities are the spaces where infrastruct ure, labor, capital, and information are concentrated; it's where cyberspace happens. In many ways, cyberspacial culture is like the modern spatial city with its segregati on of spaces and internal contradictions, only more so. And just as there are resistance mov ements to urban domination and the multinational corporate culture located in cities, the Net embraces a multitude of local and international anti-globalization movements that us e the global technology. There are at least four ways that the notion of the globalization of culture i s used today: The use of the Net to communicate local, ethnic, religious, and national cul tures to a worldwide and international audience. This could be called optimisti c multiculturalism on the Net where anyone with access can participate. The worldwide diffu sion of dominant cultures through the global marketplace (Western and American culture s globalized through ownership of infrastructure and production), reading \"globalizat ion\" as another case of hegemony, cultural imperialism, or Americanization. The general homogenization or \"internationalization\" of culture, favoring Wes tern developed nations and their languages and values, accompanied by an awareness of a resulting dilution or disappearance of local and minority cultures. In t he political economy of communications, the movement toward worldwide access to communicat ions technology and connectivity across territorial boundaries. The goals of global access and u biquity of the Net require dealing with two forces, one toward technology development and diffusion,"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"the other toward governmental and institutional controls over international interconnectivity. We are not attempting to describe an object or phenome non, but trying to track a nexus of relations in real time, reflections on a few themes, rath er than a developed argument: The historical context for the imagined communities and identities i n cyberculture and popular myths of globalization. The movements of localized communities and ide ntities that seem to be a backlash to globalization in the networked age (including th e paradox of using the Net to promote local, ethnic, and religious politics). Globalizat ion, in one manifestation, is global localization: political groups use the Net to promo te local interests and identity politics rooted in very historic place-governed issues lik e race, nation, territory, and language. Globalization as urban concentration, or networks of global \"informational cities,\" the spaces of economic and political concentr ation studied by Castells and Sassen. A more appropriate notion is the global city or globalizat ion of cities in a networked economy, rather than cyberspace as an all-inclusive, homogeneous, worldwide, neutral, transnational occurrence. Let's first consider the idea of cyberculture as contained in the ide a of virtual community. Cyberculture often assumes a global virtual community like that describe d by Howard Rheingold, but the embedded history of the notion of \"community\" used he re is usually ignored in the glimmer of utopia. In most uses, virtual community is based on an imagined, new post-national community sustained by the Net and self-consciously de ployed Net applications. The term attempts to resist or ironize globalization in the ordinary sense of international political and economic regimes.The idea of the new, imagi ned virtual communities of the Net actually has some interesting affinities wi th, as well as divergence from, the imagined communities of modern nationalism that Benedict An derson analyzed in his influential study, Imagined Communities. Imagined communities are not imaginary, fictive or unrelated to material, r eal-world conditions. Quite the contrary: the shared identity of imagined commun ity expressed in a common language and medium of communication is what holds nationalism toge ther, authorizing and validating the political and economic power of a state. Nationalis ms were formed through the ability to achieve identity across distances while acc ommodating internal diversity. Nationalism, which Anderson sees as born with the sense of difference and continuity in New World states, imagines the simultaneity of old and new across geographical boundaries. The identity of difference created by the new s tates of the Americas was sustained by the communications technologies of the time: The parallels to imagined global, cybercommunity are clear: as print helped produce the imagined communities of nationalism, the Net generates a new commun ity imagined as post-national. Books and newspapers, formerly at the nexus of national economi es and identities, were the first mass market commodities in capitali sm. The convergence of computing and telecommunications underlying the Net is the contem porary, international technology for global identities. In the same way that the New World nations imagi ned themselves as communities parallel and comparable to those in Europe, pr oponents of the global community of cyberspace see themselves in a community parallel and c omparable to the old communities of nations, ethnicities, religions, and geographical cit ies, but"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"transcending the limitations of these communities with a new technol ogy that makes place, time, and local governments irrelevant. The idea of a cyberspatial, virtual community was thus ready to be born in the U.S., where mass media have long been used to support or create \"new\" community identi ties structurally dependent on differences from older communities of or igin. The imagined post-national \"nation of cyberspace,\" with people like John Perry Barlow le ading its cessation, is in many ways an extension of the logic of imagined communities. Bu t as recent research on globailzation has shown, the role of nation states isn't over. It take s international cooperation to create globalization. We're entering a era of globaliz ed regional and urban economies (Castells, 1: 97-103). The virtual community is thi s embedded in the political economy of the global informational city. My second theme is the paradox of global localization. There is an important coun ter-effect or internal contradiction in our global, Net-based information society: s imultaneously with the rise of global networked society there is an increase in national, ethn ic, and religious identity politics and the resistances to globalization inherent in th ese movements. Many of the identity groups represent themselves as explicit points of resis tance to a global system of any kind while simultaneously using the tools of globalization (Net commu nications, Web presence, satellite communications). The trend of global localizat ion would be easy to write-off as a feature of the postmodern condition, the movement from gr and unifying ideologies to local politics and identities, from macro to micro. But there 's a deeper underlying logic at work. As Manuel Castells states, \"our societies are increasingly structured around a bipolar opposition between the Net and the Self\" (1:3): New information technologies are integrating the wo rld in global networks of instrumentality. Computer-mediated communication be gets a vast array of virtual communities. Yet the distinctive social and politic al trend of the 1990s is the construction of social action and politics around p rimary identities, either ascribed, rooted in history and geography, or newly built in an anxious search for meaning and spirituality. The first historical steps of inf ormational societies seem to characterize them by the preeminence of identity as their organizing principle. (Castells, 1:22) Mixed in with the current global wave of technotopia and optimism about the e conomic and political potential of the Internet, we have parallel movements of politi cal and economic fragmentation, isolationism, and a proliferation of regionalisms. The Web is now home to a proliferating array of self-defined communities and subcultures who attempt to represent themselves as sites of resistance to globalizat ion. For example, the Intentional Communities website hosts information for the communitar ian movement, which has roots in 19th-century utopian communities. The search engine f or the site is hosted by gaia.org, an eco-village service, whose \"secretariat\" is Gaia Villages, Den mark. This movement seeks to build internally self-sustaining, localized c ommunities. Like similar utopian community movements in the late 19th century, the curre nt movements represent themselves as points of resistance to urban, technological, a nd capitalist ways of living. The forces of the Net--the globalized information economy--are def lected by the"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"needs of the Self, and the local takes only what it needs from the global, lik e the Lo-Techs in Johnny Mnemonic . Likewise, the Net now intersects with--and supports--a variety of local language movements. Most notable are the regional linguistic movements in Europ e: the Gaelic dialects in Brittany and Ireland, Basque in Spain, Frisian in the Nethe rlands. As transnational culture dominates, regional ethic-linguistic identit ies emerge as counter movements ( New York Times , Sunday, Oct. 17, 1999, p.4). The Web is also home to thousands of political activist groups, both local and glo bal. The vast majority of these activist and identity groups follow Castells' desc ription of \"primary identity\" groups rooted in history, geography, race, and language. \"Global cybercultu re\" as imagined by American cyberpunks seems a precious fantasy in this cont ext. The Net works in collaboration with satellite and broadcast technologies to s upport and promote ethnic and religious political movements that run counter to mai nstream nationalisms supportive of globalization. But these efforts also instantiat e globalization. My final theme is cyberspace as an effect of the global, informational city. Gl obalization is actually a networked urbanization, a reconcentration of capital, production, and l abor in cities as the nodes of the networked economy. Global cities are the node s of cyberspace, the space of flows embodying the simultaneous concentration and decentrali zation of people, economic activity, technical infrastructure, communications, and info rmation. What, then, is cyberpace? Cyberspace is an imagined network layer siting on top of t he physical infrastructure of cities. Cyberspace is an imagined continu ous, worldwide, networked city; the global city that never sleeps, always experienced in re al time. As Mike Davis, author of the wonderful study of L.A., City of Quartz, states: The contemporary city simulates or hallucinates its elf in at least two decisive senses. First, in the age of electronic culture and economy, the city redoubles itself through the complex architecture of its information and media networks... If so, urban cyberspace - as the simulation of the city's information order - will be experienced as even more segregated, and devoid of true public space, than the traditional built city. Southcentral LA, for instan ce, is a data and media black hole, without local cable programming or links to major d ata systems. Just as it became a housing/jobs ghetto in the early twentieth centur y industrial city, it is now evolving into an electronic ghetto within the emerging infor mation city. (Davis, Urban Dialogue, May 1997) Cyberspace is not a disembodied fantasy but is embedded in the material space of global economics and infrastructure. Cyberspatial culture in its current form is a fantasy of a postmodern city, the LA, New York, Hong Kong, and Tokyo of our dreams. Cyberspace i s unthinkable today except as networks of global, informational cities. Cultural globalization, in the sense of the diffusion of cultural product ions on the Net, follows the logic of urban concentration in the global information economy. Cyberpace is a segmented and segregated space, much like global cities where IT inf rastructure, capital, firms, labor, and services are concentrated. Concentrated urban diversit y and decentralized sources of power and value seem to be producing a post-Net p aranoia and re-"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"localization. Fantasies about local sustainable communities, like those of the post-Romantic era over a century ago, happen only with city people. There are two forces at work in globalization: the spread of the Net inte rnationally follows urban infrastructures, and nations around the world are cooperating in th e creation of a global network economy by creating networks of globalized informational cities that require liberalized financial and trade policies. We can interpret the concentration of Internet nodes as a global economic indicator. The last survey of Internet h osts by Network Wizards quantifies these trends: the growth of the Net is strongest in countries with cities that function as network economy nodes. Further reading on the nature of Hephaistos may be found in the following: FACING THE GODS, \"Hephaistos: A PAttern of Introversion,\" by Murray St ein GODS IN EVERYMAN, Jean Shonoda Bolen, M.D. THE TWELVE OLYMPIANS, Charles Seltman CELTIC QUEST, John Layard MYTH AND MODERN MAN, Raphael Patai, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Clif fs, N.J., 1972; p. 95-104, \"The Myth of the Marxist World.\" CANNIBALS AND KINGS; THE ORIGINS OF CULTURE, Marvin Harris, Ran dom House, N.Y., 1977, p. 179-190, \"The Industrial Bubble.\" SPIRITUAL MYTH The spiritual myth of Hephaestos in our society is the triumph of technol ogy and modernization. But these are the most literal forms of its spiritual es sence. In arcane lore, Hephaistos is the archetypal metallurgist or alchemist. Alchemy was the psycho-spiritual science which gave birth to modern chemistry. Alchemy arose among tradesm en who held guild secrets in common. Their silence and secrecy concerning the ir art showed their prudence, and harks back to the association of this archetype with Trump IX, THE HERMIT. Alchemy is concerned primarily with the work of refinement, on both t he physical and spiritual level--in fact, both are synonymous. The central problem in alche my is expressed as the spiritual redemption of one's physical body. The practice of the ar t of alchemy centers on the spiritual redemption of matter and the body. Transformi ng lead to gold means that there is a process of refinement which applies to mankind as well as to the smelting of ores. Purifying and tempering the spirit is known as sublimatio. This indi cates raising, ennobling, or channeling instinctual energies into creativity, both outer (art objects or artifacts) and inner (refining personality, soul-making). Physically, we are seeking to establish a relationship with our bodies and nature which creates op timal health or well- being. Alchemy is known as the Great Work, because that which \"works\" is that which has the power to transform. Hephaistos sought to transform himself into an idealize d spiritual being devoid of imperfections, much like his rather abstract \"father,\" Zeus. Hephaistos seeks a personal immortality, either through his works or through his Gre at Work. His"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"never-ending drive and energy comes from this internal motivating force . As an alchemist he conducts several of his experiments on himself, striving for a union o f psyche and matter, or soul with substance. Alchemy strives for the experience of spiritual rebirth via the union of opposites, such as that represented by the marriage union of heavenly Aphrodite and earthy H ephaistos. Alchemy requires resurrection of the soul of body. The challenge we f ace as modern alchemists is to \"see through\" to a unified vision of mundane physical pr ocesses with spiritual values. The solution is to visualize the physical body as a metaph or for psychic transformation, such as that described in Jungian psychology. In alchemy the stages of psychological or spiritual transformation are categoriz ed as specific metals, which correspond with planetary powers. Thus, Saturn =lead; Luna=silver; Sol=gold; Mercury=quicksilver; Venus=copper; Mars=iron; and Jupiter=tin . The dynamic impulse of theoriginal alchemists, modern chemists and physicists is the same. Namely, to find out how God works, and imitate that process. This Opus, or Work, is understood as taking place in a sealed retort vessel. T he nature of this vessel is the origin of the common term, \"Hermetically sealed\" and it originally referred to the self-contained psyche. This containment insures th at none of the ingredients will be lost and also provides a container in which the contents are slowl y heated or cooked. This process is called calcinatio. Remember, Hephaistos was a smolderin g, fiery principle. The initial material of the untransformed instincts (prima materia) goes through several stages of refinement, defined as operations. These are not always presente d in the same sequence in different alchemical texts. Most however include form s of calcinatio (heating); solutio (dissolving); coagulatio (congealing); sublimatio (ennobling); morti fication or nigredo (blackening); ablutio (whitening); seperatio (seperating); and coniunctio (uniting). There are also operations of circulating, multiplying, and reiterating. The body is of vital importance in any alchemical operation. Alchemy insists on the transformation of the instinctual and biophysical phenomena into psychi c experience, but it does not seek to \"transcend.\" The feet of Hephaistos are forever embe dded in matter, distorting the purely abstract patterning principle of spirituality. Our modern alchemies--chemistry and technology--have lost their spiri tual value, altogether. They have culminated in a system of production intensificati on based on petrochemicals. Our greed for fossil-fuel technology which drives the m achinery of war may obliterate not only our energy reserves but the biosphere itself thr ough the greenhouse effect or nuclear winter. Myth recounts how Hephaistos created robots, beautiful golden-haired fe male androids to substitute for human companionship (virtual and cyber-sex?), as well as wh eeled conveniences which functioned as servo-mechanisms much like pr ototypical cars. But, he couldn't manufacture what he desired most ardently--to be loved for hims elf, as he is. It makes us think of Speilberg's A.I. , Artificial Intelligence, and the promise of ersatz \"unconditional love\" from biomechanoids.

The symbol of the furnace i tself stands for an \"artificial uterus.\" The Hephaistian passion for creative works are deeply reflective of the mother. A Hephaistian man will experience certain characteristic problems and issues. He may find himself an outcast from the conventional world of patriarchal values. He may be moody and swing between grandiose fantasies and deep depression. He looks and thinks of himself as unheroic. He cleaves to the world of the feminine, in his thinking, creativity, and li festyle. He is fascinated by the mystery of creativity. His inner images hold his soul in thr all to the projects of the moment in which he can completely lose himself. A re ductionistic viewpoint might judge him as anima-possessed, or emotionally crippled. His emotions jerk him around. This pattern may be even more threatening to the feminine ego. Hephaest us connects to her deepest feminine-maternal impulses, yet wants something other than simple maternity. This animus represents a subtle undermining threat to simple, natu ral feminine creativity, in that he tends toward creating the symbol that mirrors the creati ve process of nature but produces an artificial product which at once represents and substitu tes for the real thing. Hephaestian creativity can seem monstrous to the feminine psyche bec ause it goes against her natural feminine creativity by undermining or rechanneling it.

CHAPTER X: THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE ZEUS "},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"Zeus is the king of the Gods, and as such permeates the universe with hi s force manifesting as energy, light, and matter. He is the motivator behind the religious and p hilosophical urge, particularly metaphysics and natural philosophy. He structures our societies through patriarchy and our individual father-complexes. Offspring of Cronos and Rhea, Zeus is the head of the Olympian Gods and belongs to the trinity of the father-authority p rinciple with his brothers Poseidon and Hades. As the ultimate authority, he comes clos est to embodying the archetype of the Self. The Self is a Jungian term for the Absolute. It is the ordering and unifyi ng principle which guides the process of spiritual development. We sense the quality of the Self when we can envision our future selves actualizing our spiritual potential. The Sel f is the God-image in our psyches. It represents the fullest extension and potential of an in dividual, and provides transcendent experience of the highest spiritual value which comes from beyond one's own personal powers. The inner spiritual resources, termed Zeus by the Greeks, lie deep within our inner nature, a metaphor of Light. Zeus is the image of wholeness, prese nted in the masculine version. The ancients thought of Zeus as a weather god, the sky god who controlled storms an d lightning. However, in our daily life, he also governs our internal weather con ditions and may manifest his powers in psychic storms (psychological disruption s). Zeus is the master of wise judgement and justice. His deep attachmen t to his daughter Athena personifies his philosophic attitude. Zeus is the prototypi cal philosopher, or \"lover of wisdom.\" Zeus has the capacity to temper severity with mercy and compass ion. He embodies not only the law, but that creative energy which is the constant ur ge to spill out and propagate itself. His unceasing urge to impregnate and project himself l ed to his numerous love affairs with mortals and goddesses. Zeus is that energy constantly striving to realize new consciousness or ne w fruits of itself, reflecting his all-embracing expansiveness. Self-appointed \"follow ers of Zeus\" seek out numerous lovers in accordance with Zeus' principle of wisdom. This doe sn't mean that no complications or consequences will follow. Just wait until Hera fin ds out! A man with a Zeus-like temperament is very likely in a position of powe r, leadership, and service in the community. He employs his wisdom and good will when he e xercises his authority. He is a man with cultural awareness, and behaves accordingly for th e benefit of himself and others. He combines an intelligent, healthy mind with a ro bust body. This archetype corresponds with Trump X, THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. Zeus and other thunder gods have traditional relationships with the Wheel of the Zodiac. Th is depicts the Game of Life which Zeus plays so well. He uses intuition and systemati c thinking to further his aims. This path is symbolized as the palm of the hand. A person who is the seeming master of his own fate or lucky, seems to have the world \"in the palm of his han d.\" Good fortune is a gift of the gods, a gift of destiny. In esoteric astrology the Jupiter center is linked with the solar plexus . In Indian philosophy, the solar plexus is the power chakra, from which this energy is d istributed throughout the rest of the body. It is perceived as an internal whirling for ce within the"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"subtle body, and expressed in personality and experience. It is our fate, for tune, or destiny in dynamic action, with its cycles of good fortune and setbacks. It is the activi ty of evolution. The Jupiter center is roughly in the center of the body and control s higher evolutionary development, through the subconscious. This nerve plexus fun ctions like an \"abdominal brain\" for physical and visceral processes. The Wheel is a vortex of force with a stable center. It is the strange attractor of a life--it's destiny. THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE symbolizes the energies of a master field, a universal field. And we access that field through our solar plexus. It is here, not the heart center, where we store our energy, whether that is love and healing, or ten sion and conflict. We exchange energies with other people from this center also. A negative Zeu s-type might be effective, but could also be viewed as bossy, or self-righteous in his authoritarianism. People who set themselves up as moral authorities must dispense judg ements. When these judgements are severe, they seem like thunderbolts hurled at a transgr essor. Qabala teaches ghat the secret of mastering circumstances is to be found in realizing that the center, the very heart of the Wheel, the primary Point of first Unit y, is our only safe habitation. When we are identified with the ruling power which ke eps us in balance, which keeps the wheeling activities of cosmic cycles in blance, we are simul taneously ath the beginning and end of our quest, since they are really the same place. Zeus-consciousness has to do with the development of a strong, effectively c oping ego, which does not tolerate the thwarting of its will. If we fall into an i dentification with this principle of ego-strength (father-complex), we may find ourselves dis pensing similar judgements, as if we embodied the Law. The shadow-side of this complex is shown, for example, in high-powered politicians who sometimes cross over the line as if they were above the law--a law unto them selves. They rationalize, deny, and delude themselves that the ends justify the mean s. We are possessed by Zeus when we act like God-Almighty. Identification of the ego with th e powers of the archetype of Self results in an ego inflation. The ego gets puffed up with ai r, acting proud, pompous, vain, and presumptuous. When we are caught in an inflation (ego-trip ) our ego tries to take credit for the transcendent qualities of the Self. This may be overcome by developing a conscious awareness of the transpersonal aspect of the Zeus principle. In its positive manifestation it is an increased c apacity for objective judgement. To experience this, the ego must give up its false-pride. Ove rcoming false pride is a major goal of spiritual development. The original purpose of the \"I\" or ego i s to know the universe. The actual meaning of the word 'Zeus' stems from djeu - m eaning the moment or event of lighting up. This is a lighting up, not strictly in the p hysical sense, but also in the sense of insight and illumination. We get this sense when we dialogue with our subconscious and it yields an answering oracle. This \"I-Self\" dialogue t akes many forms. Really, there is no distinction to be made between lighting up in the ph ysical or metaphysical sense. The experience of illumination is just as real whet her caused by a material source or not. It is Zeus who controls not only the panorama of meteorol ogical phenomena, but also the domain of consciousness. Zeus connects with all th e forms of heavenly light, of both inner and outer world. His essence appears as photons (quanta of"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"electromagnetic energy), lightning, and illumination. He is the arche typal illuminator who \"lights up our lives.\" The type of love which could be described as \"ligh tning striking from above\" come in like an electric flash. It is Zeus entering the mortal f rame. The religious view of the natural event we call lightning or lighting up d oesn't necessarily require an agent apart from and outside the action. THE GOD IS THE EFFECT. T his is his epiphany. Such a division of experience into action and agent is excluded by the immediacy of the experience in its first actual moment. Only afterward i s there a name attached to the event, and even later an abstraction derived from the exper ience. For a religious experience, event and man are enough. According to C. Kerenyi (1975), \"With the Greeks the event at which 'Theos! ' could be called out could happen not only in dreams but also in nature and in histor y and simultaneously in the additional dimension of spirit.\" PHYSICAL FORM In \"Inflation for Beginners\", John Gribbin states that no self-respe cting theory of the Universe is complete without a reference to inflation -- and at the same time there is now a bewildering variety of different versions of inflation to choose from. Inflation is a general term for models of the very early Universe which invol ve a short period of extremely rapid (exponential) expansion, blowing the size of what is now the observable Universe up from a region far smaller than a proton to about the size of a grapefruit (or even bigger) in a small fraction of a second. This process would s mooth out spacetime to make the Universe flat, and would also resolve the horizon pr oblem by taking regions of space that were once close enough to have got to know each other well and spreading them far apart, on opposite sides of the visible Universe today. Inflation became established as the standard model of the very early Unive rse in the 1980s. It achieved this success not only because it resolves many puzzles about the nature of the Universe, but because it did so using the grand unified theories (GUT s) and understanding of quantum theory developed by particle physicists completely indep endently of any cosmological studies. These theories of the particle world had been deve loped with no thought that they might be applied in cosmology (they were in no sense \"desi gned\" to tackle all the problems they turned out to solve), and their success in t his area suggested to many people that they must be telling us something of fundamental import ance about the Universe. The marriage of particle physics (the study of the very small) and cosmology (the study of the very large) seems to provide an explanation of how the Universe began, and h ow it got to be the way it is. Inflation is therefore regarded as the most importan t development in cosmological thinking since the discovery that the Universe is expanding f irst suggested that it began in a Big Bang. Taken at face value, the observed expansion of the Universe implies that it was born out of a singularity, a point of infinite density, som e 15 billion years ago (cosmologists still disagree about exactly how old the Universe is, but the e xact age doesn't affect the argument). Quantum physics tells us that it is meani ngless to talk in quite such extreme terms, and that instead we should consider the expansion as having started"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"from a region no bigger across than the so-called Planck length (10-35m), when the d ensity was not infinite but \"only\" some 1094 grams per cubic centimetre. These ar e the absolute limits on size and density allowed by quantum physics. The first puzzle is how anything that dense could ever expand -- it woul d have an enormously strong gravitational field, turning it into a black hole and snuffin g it out of existence (back into the singularity) as soon as it was born. But it turns out that inflation can prevent this happening, while quantum physics allows the entire U niverse to appear, in this supercompact form, out of nothing at all, as a cosmic free lunch. The idea t hat the Universe may have appeared out of nothing at all, and contains zero energy overall, was developed by Edward Tryon, of the City University in New York, who suggested in t he 1970s, that it might have appeared out of nothing as a so-called vacuum fluctuation, allowed by quantum theory. Quantum uncertainty allows the temporary creation of bubbles of energy, or p airs of particles (such aselectron-positron pairs) out of nothing, provided th at they disappear in a short time. The less energy is involved, the longer the bubble can exist. Cu riously, the energy in a gravitational field is negative, while the energy locked up in matt er is positive. If the Universe is exactly flat , then as Tryon pointed out the two numbers c ancel out, and the overall energy of the Universe is precisely zero. In that case, the quant um rules allow it to last forever. Unfortunately, if a quantum bubble (about as big as the Planck le ngth) containing all the mass-energy of the Universe (or even a star) did appear out of n othing at all, its intense gravitational field would (unless something else inte rvened) snuff it out of existence immediately, crushing it into a singularity. So the free lunch Universe seemed at first like an irrelevant specul ation -- but, as with the problems involving the extreme flatness of spacetime, and its appearance of e xtreme homogeneity and isotropy (most clearly indicated by the uniformity of the bac kground radiation), the development of the inflationary scenario showed how to remove this difficulty and allow such a quantum fluctuation to expand exponentially up to macroscopic size before gravity could crush it out of existence.. All of these problems w ould be resolved if something gave the Universe a violent outward push (in effect, acting like antigravity) when it was still about a Planck length in size. Such a small region of space would be too tiny, initially, to contain irregulariti es, so it would start off homogeneous and isotropic. There would have been plenty of tim e for signals travelling at the speed of light to have criss-crossed the ridicu lously tiny volume, so there is no horizon problem -- both sides of the embryonic universe are \"aw are\" of each other. And spacetime itself gets flattened by the expansion, in much the same way that the wrinkly surface of a prune becomes a smooth, flat surface when the prune is placed in water and swells up. As in the standard Big Bang model, we can still thin k of the Universe as like the skin of an expanding balloon, but now we have to think of it as an abs olutely enormous balloon that was hugely inflated during the first split second of its existence. The reason why the GUTs created such a sensation when they were applied to cosmology is that they predict the existence of exactly the right kind of mechani sms to do this trick. They are called scalar fields, and they are associated with the splitting apart of the original grand unified force into the fundamental forces we know today, as the Universe b egan to expand"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"and cool. Gravity itself would have split off at the Planck time, 10-43 of a second, and the strong nuclear force by about 10(exp-35) of a second. Within about 10-32 of a second, the scalar fields would have done their work, doubling the size of the Univer se at least once every 10-34 of a second (some versions of inflation suggest even more rapid expansi on than this). Curiously, this kind of exponential expansion of spacetime is exactly d escribed by one of the first cosmological models developed using the general theory of relativi ty, by Willem de Sitter in 1917. For more than half a century, this de Sitter model seemed t o be only a mathematical curiosity, of no relevance to the real Universe; but it is now one of the cornerstones of inflationary cosmology. When the general theory of relativity was published in 1916, de Sitter reviewed the theory and developed his own id eas in a series of three papers which he sent to the Royal Astronomical Society in London. The t hird of these papers included discussion of possible cosmological models -- both w hat turned out to be an expanding universe (the first model of this kind to be developed, althou gh the implications were not fully appreciated in 1917) and an oscillating universe model. The inflationary scenario has already gone through several stages of development du ring its short history. The first inflationary model was developed by Alexei Star obinsky, at the L. D. Landau Institute of Theoretical Physics in Moscow, at the end of the 1970s -- but it was not then called \"inflation\". It was a very complicated model based on a qu antum theory of gravity, but it caused a sensation among cosmologists in what was then the S oviet Union, becoming known as the \"Starobinsky model\" of the Universe; the new s did not spread outside their country. In 1981, Alan Guth, then at MIT, published a different version of the inflatio nary scenario, not knowing anything of Starobinsky's work. This version was more accessib le in both senses of the word -- it was easier to understand, and Guth was based in th e US, able to discuss his ideas freely with colleagues around the world. And as a bonu s, Guth came up with the catchy name \"inflation\" for the process he was describing. T here were obvious flaws with the specific details of Guth's original model (which he acknowledged at the time). In particular, Guth's model left the Universe after inflation filled with a mess of bubbles, all expanding in their own way and colliding with one another. We se e no evidence for these bubbles in the real Universe, so obviously the simplest model of inflation couldn't be right. But it was this version of the idea that made every cosmologist aware of the power of inflation. In October 1981, there was an international meeting in Moscow, where inflation was a major talking point. Stephen Hawking presented a paper claiming that in flation could not be made to work at all, but the Russian cosmologist Andrei Linde presente d an improved version, called \"new inflation\", which got around the difficulties wit h Guth's model. Ironically, Linde was the official translator for Hawking's talk, and had th e embarrassing task of offering the audience the counter-argument to his own work! Bu t after the formal presentations Hawking was persuaded that Linde was right, and inflation might be made to work after all. If there was part of some larger region of spacetime in which all kinds of s calar fields were at work, then only the regions in which those fields produced inflation could lead to the"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"emergence of a large universe like our own. Linde called this \"chaotic inf lation\", because the scalar fields can have any value at different places in the early super- universe; it is the standard version of inflation today, and can be regarded as an example of the kind of reasoning associated with the anthropic principle (but note that this u se of the term \"chaos\" is like the everyday meaning implying a complicated mess, and has not hing to do with the mathematical subject known as \"chaos theory\"). The idea of chaotic inflation led to what is (so far) the ultimate developme nt of the inflationary scenario. The great unanswered question in standard Big Bang c osmology is what came \"before\" the singularity. It is often said that the question is meaningless, since time itself began at the singularity. But chaotic inflation suggests that our Universe grew out of a quantum fluctuation in some pre-existing region of spacetime, and th at exactly equivalent processes can create regions of inflation within our own U niverse. In effect, new universes bud off from our Universe, and our Universe may itself have bu dded off from another universe, in a process which had no beginning and will have no end. A var iation on this theme suggests that the \"budding\" process takes place through bl ack holes, and that every time a black hole collapses into a singularity it \"bounces\" out into anot her set of spacetime dimensions, creating a new inflationary universe -- this is c alled the baby universe scenario. There are similarities between the idea of eternal inflation and a self -reproducing universe and the version of the Steady State hypothesis developed in England by Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar, with their C-field playing the part of the scalar field that d rives inflation. Modern proponents of the inflationary scenario arrived at these equations e ntirely independently of Hoyle's approach, and are reluctant to accept this analogy, havin g cut their cosmological teeth on the Big Bang model. Indeed, when Guth was asked, i n 1980, how the then new idea of inflation related to the Steady State theory, he is reported as replying \"what is the Steady State theory?\" But although inflation is gener ally regarded as a development of Big Bang cosmology, it is better seen as marrying the best featu res of both the Big Bang and the Steady State scenarios. The theory said that inflation should have left behind an expanded version of these fluctuations, in the form of irregularities in the distribution of m atter and energy in the Universe. These density perturbations would have left an imprint on the background radiation at the time matter and radiation decoupled (about 300,000 years after the Big Bang), producing exactly the kind of nonuniformity in the background radiation that has now been seen, initially by COBE and later by other instruments. After decoupling, the density fluctuations grew to become the large scale structure of the Un iverse revealed today by the distribution of galaxies. This means that the COBE observations are ac tually giving us information about what was happening in the Universe when it was less than 10-20 of a second old. No other theory can explain both why the Universe is so uniform overall, and yet contains exactly the kind of \"ripples\" represented by the distribution of galaxi es through space and by the variations in the background radiation. This does not prove that the i nflationary scenario is correct, but it is worth remembering that had COBE found a d ifferent pattern of fluctuations (or no fluctuations at all) that would have proved the inflation ary scenario wrong. In the best scientific tradition, the theory made a major and unambigu ous"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"prediction which did \"come true\". Inflation also predicts that the primordial perturbations may have left a trace in the form of gravitational radiation with particular characte ristics, and it is hoped that detectors sensitive enough to identify this charact eristic radiation may be developed within the next ten or twenty years. Standard models of inflation solve the \"monopole problem\" by arguing that the se ed from which our entire visible Universe grew was a quantum fluctuation so smal l that it only contained one monopole. That monopole is still out there, somewhere in the U niverse, but it is highly unlikely that it will ever pass our way. But Linde has discovere d that, according to theory, the conditions that create inflation persist inside a magnetic m onopole even after inflation has halted in the Universe at large. Such a monopole would look lik e a magnetically charged black hole, connecting our Universe through a wormhole in spacetime to another region of inflating spacetime. Within this region of inf lation, quantum processes can produce monopole-antimonopole pairs, which then separate exponentially rapidly as a result of the inflation. Inflation then stops, leaving an expanding U niverse rather like our own which may contain one or two monopoles, within each of which there are more regions of inflating spacetime. The result is a never-ending fractal structure, with inflating uni verses embedded inside each other and connected through the magnetic monopole wormholes. Our Uni verse may be inside a monopole which is inside another universe which is inside another monopole, and so on indefinitely. What Linde calls \"the continuous creation of expone ntially expanding space\" means that \"monopoles by themselves can solve the monopole p roblem\". Although it seems bizarre, the idea is, he stresses, \"so simple that it c ertainly deserves further investigation\". Now comes the suggestion that the \"ordinary\" place to find observers like us may be in the middle of a bubble in a much greater volume of expanding space. The conventional version of inflation says that our entire visible Universe is just one of many bubbl es of inflation, each doing their own thing somewhere out in an eternal sea of chaotic inflati on, but that the process of rapid expansion forces spacetime in all the bubbles to be flat. A useful analogy is with the bubbles that form in a bottle of fizzy cola when the top is opened. But that suggestion, along with other cherished cosmological beliefs, has now bee n challenged by Linde, working with his son Dmitri Linde (of CalTech) and Arthur Mez hlumian (also of Stanford). Linde and his colleagues point out that the Universe we live in is like a h ole in a sea of superdense, exponentially expanding inflationary cosmic material, with in which there are other holes. All kinds of bubble universes will exist, and it is possib le to work out the statistical nature of their properties. In particular, the two Lindes an d Mezhlumian have calculated the probability of finding yourself in a region of this super- Un iverse with a particular density -- for example, the density of \"our\" Universe. Because very dense regions blow up exponentially quickly (doubling in size every fraction of a second), it turns out that the volume of all regions of the super-Universe with twice any chosen density is 10 to the power of 10 million times greater than the volume of the super- Universe with the chosen density. For any chosen density, most of the matt er at that density is near the middle of an expanding bubble, with a concentration of more de nse material"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"round the edge of the bubble. But even though some of the higher density ma terial is round the edges of low density bubbles, there is even more (vastly more!) hig her density material in the middle of higher density bubbles, and so on forever. The discovery of this variation on the theme of fractal structure surprised the researchers so mu ch that they confirmed it by four independent methods before venturing to announce it to their col leagues. Because the density distribution is non-uniform on the appropriate distance scales, it means that not only may we be living near the middle of a bubble universe, but that the dens ity of the region of space we can see may be less than the critical density, compens ated for by extra density beyond our field of view. There is a simpler solution to the density puzzle, one which involves tin kering only with the models of inflation, not with long-held and cherished cosmological beli efs. That may make it more acceptable to most cosmologists -- and it's so simple that it fall s into the \"why didn't I think of that?\" category of great ideas. A double dose of inflation m ay be something to make the Government's hair turn grey -- but it could be jus t what cosmologists need to rescue their favourite theory of the origin of the Unive rse. By turning inflation on twice, they have found a way to have all the benefits of the inflati onary scenario, while still leaving the Universe in an \"open\"state, so that it wi ll expand forever. In those simplest inflation models, remember, the big snag is that after inflation even the observable Universe is left like a mass of bubbles, each expanding in its own way. We see no sign of this structure, which has led to all the refinements of the basic model. Now, however, Martin Bucher and Neil Turok, of Princeton University, working w ith Alfred Goldhaber, of the State University of New York, have turned this difficult y to advantage. They suggest that after the Universe had been homogenised by the original bou t of inflation, a second burst of inflation could have occurred within one of th e bubbles. As inflation begins (essentially at a point), the density is effectively \"re set\" to zero, and rises towards the critical density as inflation proceeds and energy from the inf lation process is turned into mass. But because the Universe has already been homogenised, t here is no need to require this bout of inflation to last until the density reaches the critical value. It can stop a little sooner, leaving an open bubble (what we see as our entire visible Uni verse) to carry on expanding at a more sedate rate. They actually use what looked like the fatal fla w in Guth's model as the basis for their scenario. According to Bucher and his colleagues, an end product looking very much like the Universe we live in can arise naturally in this way, with no \"fine tuning \" of the inflationary parameters. All they have done is to use the very simplest possible version of inflation, going back to Alan Guth's work, but to apply it twice. And you don't have to stop the re. Once any portion of expanding spacetime has been smoothed out by inflation , new inflationary bubbles arising inside that volume of spacetime will all be pre-smoothed and can end up with any amount of matter from zero to the critical density (bu t no more). This should be enough to make everybody happy. Indeed, the biggest problem now is that the vocabulary of cosmology doesn't quite seem adequate to the task of describing all this activity. The term Universe, with the capital \"U\", is usually used for everythin g that we can ever have knowledge of, the entire span of space and time accessible to our ins truments, now and in the future. This may seem like a fairly comprehensive definiti on, and in the past it"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"has traditionally been regarded as synonymous with the entirety of everything t hat exists. But the development of ideas such as inflation suggests that there may be something else beyond the boundaries of the observable Universe -- regions of space and tim e that are unobservable in principle, not just because light from them has not yet had time to reach us, or because our telescopes are not sensitive enough to detect their li ght. This has led to some ambiguity in the use of the term \"Universe\". Some p eople restrict it to the observable Universe, while others argue that it should be used to ref er to all of space and time. If we use \"Universe\" as the name for our own expanding bubble of spacetime, everything that is in principle visible to our telescopes, then maybe th e term \"Cosmos\" can be used to refer to the entirety of space and time, within which (if t he inflationary scenario is correct) there may be an indefinitely large number of other expandin g bubbles of spacetime, other universes with which we can never communicate. LONG LIVE INFLATION. An underdense universe doesn't sink cosmic inflation. Lately, observational astronomers have at last convinced theorists that the universe c ontains less matter than the theory of inflation predicts. The expansion of the unive rse, as traced by distant supernovae and radio-bright galaxies, is decelerating too slowly. The mass of galaxy clusters, as deduced from their internal motions and their ability t o focus the light of more distant objects, is too low. The number of these clusters, which should be growing if there is sufficient raw material, has changed too little. And the abundance of deut erium, which is inversely related to the total amount of matter, is too high. It seems ther e is only a third of the matter needed for geometric flatness, the expected outcome of inflation. But far from killing the theory, cosmologists say, the observations make it mor e necessary than ever—albeit in a new form. No other theory answers a nagging question in big ban g cosmology: Why is the universe even vaguely flat? Over time, the cosmos should seem ever more curved as more of it comes into view and its overall shape becomes mo re apparent. By now, billions of years after the big bang, the universe should be highly c urved, which would make it either depressingly desolate or impenetrably dense. Guth, now at Stanford University—solved the problem by postulating that the u niverse went through a period of accelerating expansion. Once-adjacent regions separ ated faster than light (which space can do—Einstein's special theory of relativity app lies to speeds within space). As a result, we now see only a fragment of the cosmos. Its overall shape is not visible yet; each fragment looks flat. Inflation also explains the near unif ormity of the universe: any lumpiness is too large scale for us to perceive. But if observers can't find enough matter to flatten space, theorists must draw one of two awkward conclusions. The first is that some new kind of dark matter m akes up the difference. The inferred matter goes by the name of \"quintessence ,\" first used in this general context by Lawrence M. Krauss of Case Western Reserve University. T he usage alludes to Aristotelian ether; besides, anything that accounts for two thi rds of physical reality is surely quintessential. Quintessence joins the two previously postulated kinds of dark matte r: dim but otherwise ordinary matter (possibly rogue brown dwarfs) and inherently invisible el ementary particles (possibly neutrinos, if these ghostly particles have a slight m ass). Both reveal"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"themselves only by tugging at visible stars and galaxies. Our fate hinges on what mak es up quintessence. The simplest possibility, Einstein's cosmological con stant, inexorably gains in relative strength as cosmic expansion dilutes matter. But other forms of quintessence, such as featherweight particles or space-time kinks, might eventually fade a way. In May, Christopher T. Hill of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory speculated t hat the quintessence mystery is related to another: the neutrino mass. So far th e only proof for quintessence is circumstantial. The latest supernova observations sugg est that cosmic expansion is accelerating, and recent cosmic microwave background measurem ents show that triangles may indeed subtend 180 degrees, as they should in flat space. Two-round inflationary theory was developed in 1995 by two teams: Martin Bucher of Princeton University, Neil G. Turok, now at the University of Cambridge, and Al fred S. Goldhaber of the State University of New York at Stony Brook; and Kazuhiro Yamamot o of Kyoto University and Misao Sasaki and Takahiro Tanaka of Osaka University. In thi s theory, the first round creates a uniform mega-universe. Within it, bubbl es—self-contained universes—spontaneously form. Each undergoes a second round of inflation that e nds prematurely, leaving it curved. The amount of curvature varies from bubble to bubble. The second idea, announced in February by Turok and Stephen W. Hawking of Cambridge, is that the smooth universe gurgled not out of a soda universe but out of utter nothingness. Updating Hawking's decade-old work on creation ex nihilo, the y devised an \"instanton\"—loosely speaking, a mathematical formula for the difference b etween existence and nonexistence—that implied we should indeed be livin g in a slightly curved universe. Finally, maybe the universe has an unusual topology, so that different parts of the cosmos interconnect like pretzel strands. Then the universe mere ly gives the illusion of immensity, and the multiple pathways allow matter to mix together and be come smooth. Such speculation dates to the 1920s but was dusted off two years ago by Neil J. Cornis h of Cambridge, David N. Spergel of Princeton and Glenn D. Starkman of Case Western Reserve. Like all good cosmological theories, these ideas lead to some wacky conclusions. Th e bubble and ex nihilo universes are infinite, which quantum laws forbid. The solu tion: let the universe be both infinite and finite. From the outside it is finit e, keeping the quantum cops happy; inside, \"space\" takes on the infinite properties of time. In the pretzel universe, light from a given object has several different ways to reach us, so we should see sever al copies of it. In principle, we could look out into the heavens and see the earth. More worrisome is that these models abandon a basic goal of inflationary theory: explaining the universe as the generic outcome of a simple process inde pendent of hard-to- fathom initial conditions. The trade-off is that cosmologists can now subjec t metaphysical speculation—including interpretations of quantum mechanics and gue sses about the \"before\"—to observational test. Out of all this brainstorming may emerge an even deeper theory than standar d inflation; by throwing a wrench into the works, observers may have fixed them. Upcoming h igh- resolution observations of the microwave background and galaxy clustering should be decisive. But if not, cosmologists may begin to question the underpinnin gs of modern"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"physics. \"If the experimental data is inconsistent with literally ever ything, this may be a signal for us to change gravity theory—Einstein theory,\" Linde says. (George Muss er). As king of the gods, Zeus also represents a fundamental universal princip le. Just as Zeus is the offspring of Cronos and Rhea, so energy is the product of frequency (rhyth m) and duration. Einstein expressed relativity through his famous equation, E = MC 2. What is the most fundamental component of existence? An examination of the physical nature of Zeus reveals the metaphysics of existence. The theory of general re lativity asserts that geometry is produced by matter or matter by geometry. One never appear s without the other in isolation. Ian Barbour describes the dependency of matter u pon duration. He says that \"time is constitutive of the being of atoms as vibratory patterns; a wave or musical note requires time in order to exist--a note is nothing at an in stant.\" Another physicist, Werner Heisenburg describes matter as energy and vice versa. H e claims, \"Energy is in fact the substance from which all elementary particles, a ll atoms and therefore all things are made, and energy is that which moves.\" If Zeus is perceived as energy, he is this essence of manifest reality. En ergy transmutes into matter when it takes on the form of an elementary particle. It manifests itself in a form. Matter and energy are actually a paradoxical unity. In relativity theory, matter-en ergy is viewed as a distortion in the structure of space. At this juncture, it is perhaps wise to reflect upon the discipline of science itself as a search for patterns and inte lligibility. This is precisely the arena of philosophy and metaphysics. The ultimate metaphysical task is to synthesize all facets of human knowl edge into one grand unified field theory of existence (a mathematical overview). The trend now appears in the scientific community as a fascination with the psycho-physical a spects of energy. Reality is a holistic gestalt which appears alternatively as space, time, en ergy, matter, and causation. Most evidence indicates it is a biolographic projection of mind. T hese abstractions of human categorizing are not absolute qualities or entities of r eality itself. But the basic nature of material existence certainly influences biological s ystems. Organic growth is a function of geometry and includes spatial relationships an d ratios. Living systems create order from disorder, but must always battle against disru ption, entropy, or chaos. No system is self-sufficient. Therefore, order is maintained by br inging in energy (i.e. food, air, water) from outside. The biochemical system has to exchange matt er with its environment all the time. Lyall Watson describes how a complex entity also begins to exchange information wit h the environment in addition to energy. This essential survival information \"arr ives in three forms--electromagnetic waves, such as light; mechanical pressures , such as sound; and chemical stimuli, such as those giving rise to taste and smell.\" In animals an d humans, these three types of signals are all converted by sense receptors which ar e in direct contact with the environment. When the stimuli contacts the receptor, an el ectrical impulse (electrical energy) carries the message into the central nervous s ystem. Hermes, electrical message, is a son of Zeus, archetypal process of \"lighting up.\" Occupations associated with Zeus include the following:"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"administrator authority figure banker boss captain of industry chauvinist director father governor king landholder magnate mentor philanderer philosopher politician president principal priest producer publisher role model scholar stock broker tyrant weatherman EMOTIONAL IMAGE It is no semantic accident that the term 'inflation' is also applied in human psychology as a term for grandiosity. 'Omnipotent' power motivations of all kinds are sympt omatic of inflation. Edinger (1972) gives \"spells of anger\" as examples of arrogant inflated states -- a misapplied attempt to coerce the environment. He cites the diction ary definition as \"Blown up, distended with air, unrealistically large and unrealistically import ant, beyond the limits of one's proper size; hence, to be vain, pompous, proud, presumptuous.\" He des cribes the term as the identification of the ego with the divine properties of th e Self, \"a state in which something small (the ego) has arrogated to itself the qualities of somethi ng larger (the Self) and hence is blown up beyond the limits of its proper size.\" We are all born into inflation due to our original unconscious fusion when th e unformed ego is all Self. In this identification, the ego imagines itself virtually as a deity. This state of wholeness or perfection is relfected in the basically round figures found universally in the art of young children. Variation yields circles with crosses or eight divis ions, sometimes swirling like swastikas -- all ancient symbols of the thundergods, incl uding Zeus. Thus, the original condition is depicted as mandala-like roundness, as reported of p rimeval man by Plato in the Symposium . Such mandala symbols are also considered therapeutic or healing. Nostalgia for this experience of oneself as the center of the universe can lead to subsequent problems and alienation. Reality-checks help the ego grow and distinguish itself from unconscious identity with the Self, yet ephiphanies or reunions of th e two foster integrity. In psychosis, this is the root of heroic-inflation -- conviction that one i s God, Jesus, Napoleon, Joan of Arc, Messiah-complex, etc. by attaching private significance to out er events which are independent of one's convictions. In negative inflation , one identifies with the divine victim; too much humility is also arrogance. The psychic danger s of inflation and alienation have been always been recognized in folk wisdom and spiritual prac tice. Both very high and very low self-esteem rest on defense mechanisms. Th e narcissistic viewpoint rarely leaves psychophysical Zone 1 of \"I, me, mine.\" A grandiose se lf craves narcissistic gratification and attention. The antidotes to this narcissi stic inflation (unmistakable and often unpleasant increase in self-confidence and conceit) are empathy,"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"humour, wisdom, selfless service, and transpersonal commitment. Kohut' s theory of narcissism considers creativeness to result from a successful trans formation of this primal libido. This creativeness arises from within and does not include dabbling i n this and that as a dilettante. It means being truly multi-faceted, expressing activity of t he soul that deserves to be called truly creative and productive (Jacoby, 1991). It is a mirroring of the cosmi c creative process, an expressed creative potential. Through rapport and empat hy we detect complex psychic configurations. Empathy, rather than projection, is how we can best relate to others. 'Narcissistic hunger' reverses this and constantly demands ou r empathic response. When rapport and empathy break down we fail to meet the reality of t he other. Depression or despondency is the result of lack of self-value, and has bee n identified by Berne and Perls as a psychological \"racket,\" designed to garner negative attenti on. Other symptoms are exagerrated modesty, wearing a striken and misunderstood l ook. These attacks from within are feared and compensated by attempts at manipulati on of others, better met through positive validation or unsolicited stroking, and a harm onization of competing forces seeking a centering of the whole personality. In order t o be effective and expressive, we need some measure of psychic maturity. Empathy, for example , requires a stable, yet flexible ego. Humour, the ability to honestly laugh at oneself as one is, genuine tolerance of ou r imperfection, is the antidote to 'narcissistic vulnerability.' Wittic isms and sarcasm are not equivalent, but merely defensive. Humour presupposes some awareness of an d tolerance of our weak points. The self as God-image plays a central role in the religious d imension. Humor and wisdom together can be profound teachers. Mentoring and the projections of the 'wise old man' or 'wise old woman' (ego i deals) can help or hinder us finding our own style of wisdom. Projections must be re-owned, and one's own connection to Source nurtured. A false pose of unflinching serenity s acrifices wholeness and psychic equilibrium. Wisdom requires courage -- the a bility to continuously and critically question our perceptions of self, others, and world. Wisdom means we perceive the relativity and acknowledge the limitations of all our conc erns and endeavors without illusions. Nevertheless, self-doubts and painful fluct uations of psychic balance are intrinsic to even a mature soul's experience of life's flow. Creativeness depends on an ego that is open and receptive to creative uncon scious impulses. Genuine creative expression helps us share our percept ions and point of view with others in a positive way. However, like empathy, it is no guarantee of being cor rectly understood. It is our means of transforming nature and our nature into cultur e, by making, constructing, combining. Its purpose is to facilitate the task of human c onsciousness to carry on actively and autonomously the creative process that lies at our own origin . Creativity helps us process or transform ourselves in times of crisis. Em otionally charged psychic contents are expressed, made to 'matter,' literally.

The opposite lifestyle is arid, meaningless 'compliance,' through the false self.

They are also not magical messages from above to which we must irresponsibly submit. Symbols of the unknown don't represent one specific course of action. A creative lifestyle helps us confront our pr oblems from the depth of our souls, find creative solutions, build self-reliance and courage, and i ncrease healthy self-esteem. On the level of human emotional response, Zeus also can be known through the father- complex. Depending on the emotional set and setting of childhood, we may have a positive or negative father image. It is composed of all those things we feel a father s hould be, and what our personal role models portrayed. The purpose of the father image is to challenge us into further exploration and growth, and he provides the support that he lps us meet the challenges of becoming an individual in our own right. A father encourages us t o find our place in the world and develop social consciousness. He counsels us to choos e a career where we may be effective, and successful. The positive father complex expresses in an attitude of extroverted enthu siasm for life. With a positive father-complex, we are eager to learn, comprehend, and experie nce many facets of life. The positive father counsels one to maintain an objective, lon g-range viewpoint which is based on wisdom and consideration for others. The negat ive father- complex may appear when the father is absent, or a poor example of the higher qu alities of Zeus. This type may be tenacious, and greedy, or grasping. Nothing is ever enough t o make up for the loss of spiritual fathering. He is a counterdependent personality, who needs to remain \"top dog\" at leas t in his own mind. He would like to control and own everything, and everyone. He is so arrogant he thinks he must take charge of managing everyone around himself. He is conti nually motivated, like the positive type, but never seems satisfied with the f ruits of his efforts. Zeus is the paradigm of the \"self-made man\" who might become workaholic an d neglect his family-life. This is ironic since these men frequently see th emselves as working so diligently in the service of their families. Today the role of father is n o longer confined to being a breadwinner who stays at work for most hours of the day. Males have become more aware of their nurturing capacities. There are implications in the changing role of the father. Now men are encouraged to take nurturing roles, even with their pre- school children. Even in post-divorce parenting, both father and mothers are staying actively in volved in the live of their children. This cultural change is evident in the men 's networks which are emerging, and such phenomena as support groups and \"paternity leave\" for new fathers. Zeus has a love of freedom and independence, but he has a strong sense of commit ment to engendering this quality in his offspring.

Frances Bacon, THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING (1605) Solomon, known for his wisdom and philosophic attitude, embodied the Zeus -type of personality. Solomon sought an ever-expanding knowledge of God and the univers e. He wrote the Song of Songs in his youth, Proverbs in mid-life, and Ecclesiaste s in old age. However, none of these sums up the entire philosophical spectrum of his worldview. That summation is the entire effect of the life of this great philosopher on culture. Intellectually, the Zeus personality may be considered a philosopher , first and foremost. A philosopher delves into the theory or logical analysis of the principles u nderlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe. Philosophy is linked intimately to morals and character, and produces a calmness or composure even in the fac e of difficulties. Philosophers are \"lovers of wisdom\" who may be compared to devotees or child ren of Zeus. Philosophy starts with the a priori assumption that it is superior to all other sciences. A philosophic viewpoint takes a cosmic perspective and uses the imagery of p enetrating vision. This lucid understanding is said to confer mastery over daily livin g and the rest of the phenomenal world. Philosophy works toward unification of perspect ives, trying to develop a solid worldview which has an all-embracing coherence. Philosop hy has a spectrum ranging from mathematics to mysticism. Philosophy seeks the razor's edge or balance point between opposites. In t heir personalities philosophers have an occupational hazard in spiritual pride and sometime s are too pompous in their judgements. Then their pronouncements sound like a clap of thunder and lightning to those whose perspective is a little earthier, (i.e. ground ed). Those not gifted (or cursed) with a philosophic bent find the pontifications of philosophe rs too abstract to be personally meaningful to themselves. But these people are still faced w ith the fundamental philosophical questions, such as Who am I?, Where do I come from?, Where am I goi ng?. Is there a god?, Does man have an immortal soul, or free will? Aristotle's METAPHYSICS opens with the statement that all men desire by nature to know. But this is by no means a universal truth concerning the intellectual p ursuit of philosophy. To be philosophically inclined is not a universal, but an archetypal truth. I t is the archetypal perspective of Zeus. Psychologically speaking, Zeus equates wi th the Self, referred to as the Higher Self in the occult tradition. Those not so philo sophically inclined"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"might understand, but not revere, such abstractions of human thought as prin ciple, law, and axiom. To them the varieties of religious experience and philosophical view points may seem as numerous and promiscuous as the liaisons of Zeus. It is the philosophic imperative of Zeus to fertilize and make fecund s o many areas of existence. The offspring of Zeus are all around us, influencing our belie f systems, styles of being, and mundane pursuits. We now live in a philosophic as well as cult ural melting pot, where integration, synergy, and synthesis describe the ideal. On the pers onal level this is a balanced, robust personality. On the group level, it marks a healthy communi ty or society. We can tap into Zeus' wisdom for personal guidance in our daily life. Zeus was not only considered an abstract Olympian god, but also a daimon (or mediator) on a person al level. In other words, he (the Self) functions as an inner guide for the mortal s who call on him. His realm involves the entire cycle of human fate; he is the determine r of destiny, delivering what we have earned through our actions. As dispenser of human fate, Zeus reigns like an almighty god. We contact Zeus when we can \"see through\" the events of our daily lives to a m ore fundamental level. On the psychological level, Zeus appears as the \"meaning\" which lights up the happenings in our lives. For great events, there is a correspondin gly profound insight. Sudden insight may be compared to a quantum leap in conscious ness. For example, an insight concerning the nature of Self might be to \"see t hrough\" to the paradox that the self, which represents wholeness, is not necessarily onl y good or noble. Since it is all things, from highest to lowest, it also embodies that qual ity known as pure self-centered selfishness. As a king, Zeus is wholly concerned wit h actualizing his own will, and from this comes the ability to be beneficent and compassionate, to give of himself. He must, however, enjoy his freedom, untrammeled by societal conventions, or he ceases to be Zeus! The paradox of Zeus is that he has developed a serene, philosophical attitude , while indulging in his most capricious whims, all the while being a hen-peck ed husband! This is a very difficult situation for Westerners to comprehend. But the Zeu s-energy is limited and held in check by the other gods. When Zeus becomes too impressed with his own abilities to mediate the opposites, his wisdom can turn to folly and an excessive concei t. Philosophy can be the basis of a personal and social worldview. Philosophy is not j ust intellectual curiosity, but functions as a meta-culture. A listing of t he chief types of factors which influence the cultural behavior of man reads like a keyword corre spondence for Zeus and his concerns. These include: hunger, sex, self-defense, power, possession, fear, un seen powers, law, custom, hope, self-respect, position, achievement, need for fun, companion ship, concern for other, need for children, exercise of skills, appropriate degree of social , political, and individual freedom, appropriate degree of tradition, knowing where one s tands with respect to each of the above, role and goal of man. John Oulton Wisdom (1975) classifie s these as follows: \"environmental, bodily needs, political, religious, legal , social, human relations, gambling, ideals, identity, knowing the system.\""},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"Different philosophies have different goals since they are based on spe cific value systems. But most philosophies, from the early days of Greek thought have had to contend with the problem of universals, essences, and categories. This problem boils down t o the question: \"Is a universal a word, or a conception in the mind, or an essence in a natural obj ect?\" No problems are articulated without the existence of a human being. Philo sophy is concerned with the dynamics of comprehension and comprehensibility. Zeus rep resents our primordial awareness and alertness from which philosophy begins. The ar ea where physical and non-physical (or psychic) merge is the human mind. Just what is the mind, and what gives it the ability to think a thought? We nee dn't even resort to philosophy for an answer. Modern neurology posits the seat of the min d deep in the brain stem. This higher portion of the stem constitutes approxima tely 1% of the total brain and is known as the Reticular Activating System, or RAS, for short. The RAS is fundamental to the support of life. It is even more critical than the cere bral cortex, whose removal is compatible with survival under the proper circumstances. The main function of the RAS is the regulation of arousal. It controls all sleeping and waking c ycles, and also the \"emotional brain\" or limbic system. The RAS also coordinates incoming and outgoing signals regulating the physical fu nctions of the spinal cord and autonomic nervous system. Even though more recent e volutionary developments, such as the cortex, seem to be the 'seat of consciousness,\" t he 'mind' originates in this ancient formation. The RAS is critical in the produc tion of motivational and emotional feelings. Appetites, emotional effects, and feelings of int erest all spring from this mechanism of arousal. The brain contains many separate mechanisms, each of which is activated through electrical currents passing along its circuitry of insu lated nerve fibers. Thus many separate functions are simultaneously coordinated through the RA S. Passage through the higher brain stem (diencephalon) may change the quali ty or intensity of an incoming signal. The RAS may inhibit or reinforce sensory messages changi ng the reception of the signal or message in the thalamus and cortex. This purpos e of the RAS is functional integration. Man is an instinctual robot without the RAS, cap able of no decisions, will, memory, or humor. It is still a mystery where the mind (R AS) gets its energy since nerve cells are either activated or paralyzed. Some neurologi sts do not believe that the arousal comes strictly from neuronal activity in the brain. It is easy to deduce, however, that the mind focuses attention, is aware, reason s, and decides with understanding. No analogous point has been found in the ce rebral cortex which can be stimulated to function with electrodes. There can be no ar tificial stimulation of belief or decision with an electrical charge. The RAS \"lights up \" the brain with mind. Consciousness (mind) is an integrative function roughly equivalent to \"c oherence\" in light (i.e. laser). Philosopher, Bertrand Russell expressed an interesting philosophi cal viewpoint on 'thought' in his PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION: Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth--more than ruin, more e ven than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions and comfortable habits; thought is anar chic and lawless,"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. I t sees man, a feeble speck, surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence; yet it bears itself proudly , as unmoved as if it were lord of the universe. Thought is great and swift and free, the li ght of the world, and the chief glory of man. This seems most true when that thought originates in the higher aspec t of our being--the Self, rather than from our wounded personality complexes. Jung noted the p aradoxical nature of the Self as the center and circumference of the psyche--it s center and symbol of wholeness--the integrative function. The ego originates in the Self and is fulfilled through relating to it as a source of nurture. The self brings structure and archetypal order to the inherent chaos of the psyche--it organizes and directs the psychic process, much like a musical conduct or. The Self strives to realize itself, with or without conscious awareness on the part of the personality. It has its own agenda, and can appear like an alien being, thing, or consciousness when we project its power outside ourselves. The self is the author of our sense of fate or destiny. If our ego identifies with it too much, we go on an ego trip, claiming transpersonal powers for our puny self. Jung defined the Self as the archetype of the God-image in the psyche, noting that is all we c an ever directly apprehend of God, in any event. Only after direct experience of the image do our minds create interpretation, speculation, dogma, or denial of the numinous experie nce. Jung alleged that God can be known directly through the symbols of the Self, l istening to the voices of the soul. God is immanent in the depths of the psyche, the tran spersonal realm. God is everywhere as Self in universe, nature, and man in this animis tic perspective. The Jungian process of individuation helps to raise the God-images int o conscious awareness, stimulating an I-Thou dialogue between ego and the Self. The Self also has a shadow-side--the dark side of God--because it is a par adoxical unity. Zeus exemplified this shadow side, acting out his Will no matter what. T his shadow of archetypal good, which is archetypal evil creates a challenge for the individ uating ego. This is an inherent part of the heroic quest, and leads to humility. The Self ap pears when we need transpersonal guidance to balance the ego and unconscious perspecti ves, restoring psychic health.

SPIRITUAL MYTH This life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece of this ent ire existence, but is in a certain sense the \"whole;\" only this whole is not so constituted th at it can be surveyed in one single glance. This, as we know, is what the Brahmins express in that sacred, mys tical formula which is yet really so simple and so clear: TAT TVAM ASI, this is you. Or, again , in such words as \"I am in the east and in the west. I am below and above, I AM THIS WHOLE WORLD. Ervin Schoedinger, \"My View of the World\" Zeus has a metaphysical nature since he represents the wholeness de scribed through the personalities of the other gods of the pantheon. He is the center of the pan theon and, therefore, represents the whole universe of manifest phenomena. He is the father of Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Hebe, Ares, Persephone, Hermes, Dionysus, The M uses, Herakles, the Graces, the Fates, and the Hours, etc. Zeus is the metaphysical nature of the universe. Just what is metaphysic s? It is a branch of philosophy which studies that which is beyond physics. It deals wi th first principles, seeking to explain the nature of being and the origin and structure of the w orld. Logic studies the elements and functions of intelligence, but metaphys ics studies being and its essential properties. When we have absorbed the knowledge available thr ough studying physics, the next logical step to examine is metaphysics. Thus, we formu late our worldview through knowledge and belief. Metaphysical thinking is not vague and speculative, but precise and strai ghtforward. It describes the foundations of our belief systems, disclosing our a pr iori assumptions, or assumed truths. We all base our worldviews on \"assumed truths,\" therefor e each of us embraces a metaphysical viewpoint which has a paramount influence on our l ives. Metaphysics has been criticized as nonsensical or occult by scientist s, and heretical by the religious establishment. In reality, it is neither, seeking merely to d isclose the"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"presuppositions of our belief systems, from its unique relative p erspective. It describes the most general features of our existence and seeks to unify the various domains of value and fact. Myth is a metaphysical system. Our beliefs about the nature of existence ar e conditioned by the mythic level of psyche. Myth can be viewed as a preliterate form of scien ce, through which culture was transmitted. Mythic cosmologies, including the la test scientific theories, deal with the descent and ascent of man, echoing the deeper truths of exis tence. Myths embody a universal meaning with multiple levels of interpretation. Myths describe cosmological truths because they are in rapport with the fundamental worki ngs of the cosmos. Cosmologies describe the descent into matter of primal universal entities. They use symbols since there is no other language for describing the ultimate natu re of things, and symbols are the descriptors spontaneously produced by the human psyche in archetypes, myths, and dreams. Physicists substitute mathematical formulae, but this is another t ype of symbol which stands in the place of reality. Numbers, and mathematics, are an artifact of h uman culture, a human translation of the archetype of cosmic ordering processes. They may give scientists an occasional flash of genius, which is like a stroke of lightni ng, but it only illuminates a small portion of the path. Physics is actually a school of philos ophy--natural philosophy. W e may look at physics' view of \"reality\" as a modern myth. An examination of the creation myth, as described by physics yields interesting persp ectives when compared with the Greek cosmogony. The overthrow of Uranus, the Sky God, by Cronos and Gaea through his castration fulfi lls the basic postulate of perpetual transformation. Cronus is the princip le of determinism whose function is to regulate not only his father, but his children. Zeu s escapes the regulation of Cronos and escapes determinism through his progeny. He uses s trategy to escape the laws of Cronos (space-time). In the world of light there is n o time, space, or mass. Photons have complete freedom. The Uranus-Cronos-Zeus cycle describes the generation of the univer se. First there is Mater, matter or substance or mass, known as Gaea. She is impregnated by Uran us, the original evolutionary impulse, who is characterized as the Starry Heavens. Cron os castrates Uranus, delimiting him. Cronos (spacetime) thus represen ts the law of limitation, and embodies duration, chronicity, and chronological order. This implies deat h, for all forms which come into being, must cease or dissolve at some time. Zeus escapes being eaten by \"Time\" through the strategy of producing numer ous offspring, of great diversity. Zeus is the expanding universe, whose nature i s observable through Doppler shift. The evidence for an expanding universe comes from observation of receding galaxies. Galaxies twice as far away are receding twice as fast, etc., as if al l had started from a common point with different velocities about 14 x 10, to 9th power ye ars ago. But the Greek creation myth did not begin with Zeus. It begins with C haos--Void Space-- which can be viewed as a vacuum with random fluctuation (the random elem ent). From this egg of the universe was born the cosmogonic Eros, the God of Love, or primal"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"attraction. This Eros may also be described as the dominating force in the large -scale dynamics of the universe--Gravitation, the force of attraction which is t he curvature of the structure of spacetime. Even though Zeus represents the unity of the superior progenitor, he is limited by the other gods, as myth shows. Our modern myths of existence may be \"seen through\" from the archetypal perspectives of many gods. An imaginal description of archetypal reality discloses Zeus as ENERGY, wh ich can manifest as LIGHT. As radial energy, Zeus is expansive. E = hf means that energy ( E) equals the frequency of the light emitted (f) times Planck's const ant (h). This formula gave birth to the quantum age. When an atom is split mass is converted into energy. Z eus is a \"quantum god.\" Recall the lament of Einstein that \"God doesn't play dice w ith the universe.\" On the other hand, Zeus is inexorably linked with gambling, ri sk, play and the uncertainty principle. Zeus is a restless force. The speed of light i s constant and it has no rest mass, because it never rests. The velocity of light is therefore a u niversal constant--the same everywhere all the time. The unstable vacuum, known as Chaos, is not simply the absence of matter, bu t a complex system, within which matter can arise through random fluctuation. This is probably conditioned by deterministic chaos operating in quantum fluctuation , translating the virtual energy of scalar fields into observable energy events. Once matter (s ubstance, the velocity-independent factor in momentum) arises, the dynamics of th e vacuum lead to our present expanding universe. It grows slowly till it reaches the criti cal mass for expansion. Once expansion begins from any point, more matter is automatically create d, which induces more expansion, etc. Zeus is thus the \"Big Bang\", or the entire inflationary scenario of expansion and evolution (Universal Mind). E=mc2 means that as a particle's energy increases so does i ts mass. More simply, it is speculated that light twists on itself to create mat ter. We come from light and return to light. An electron is a photon, or a quantum of action frozen into mass. Li ght is an enigma since it has no rest mass or charge. Light never rests; it is rest less. It is pure action. Light appears in whole units of action which lose no energy. Light accou nts for all energy exchange at atomic and molecular levels. Both action (light) and matter come in whole units, which are indivisible. Unimpaired, light follows the principle of least action, along geodesic worl d lines. Since light is quantized in photons, light is pure action, and action comes in whol es. Wholeness is inherent in the nature of action, the nature of Zeus, and the nature of Self , and God. The Creator is not separate from the Creation in natural philosophy. Quantum physics, like religion, reveals first causes. Arthur Young (1976) ass erts that Light = quanta of action = wholes = first cause. Photons have total freedom since they are independent of spacetime, and are at the top of the causal chain. We can trace the Big Bang backwards through physics. As we go backward through time , the temperature gets hotter and hotter. As matter (atoms) get super heated, it becomes a plasma because the heat makes violent collisions between atoms. They can 't hold together. So matter consists of nuclei and loose, unbounded electrons. Before the plasma stage, even nuclei couldn't hold together, so matter exited only as energetic parti cles. Even earlier in"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"creation the particles couldn't hold together, and matter could only exis t as quarks. Prior to that, conditions are so intense that of the four basic forces (gravity; ele ctromagnetism; strong force which bonds nuclei; and weak force such as radioactive decay) the electromagnetic and weak forces merge, leaving three forces. Still earlier, the even greater temperature melded the strong and e lectromagetic-weak interactions, leaving only two forces of gravity and the fused strong-weak-elect romagnetic force. We are approaching the limits of physics which postulates at Planck Time (10-43 second) all forces unify. To describe this unified condition, physic s needs to develop a theory which marries quantum mechanics to the laws of general relativit y which describe gravitation. This theory of quantum gravity would be a grand unified theory of the creation. The Greeks defined relationships among archetypal principles throug h a pantheistic viewpoint. Thus we might contemplate other physical archetypes and thei r relationship to Zeus as energy and light. For example, grandmother Rhea might be rhythm, harm ony, resonance, or the phenomena of beats. Themis embodies physical laws, con servation, and action/reaction. Hera symbolizes (molecular) bonding. Thanatos is the p rinciple of entropy. Entropy is ever-present, just as death in the soul is concurrent with d aily life. Hades can influence us through radioactive decay which can be an invisible destr oyer, mutating our genes. Poseidon is characterized as a sea-god. He could correspond with wave fr onts (amplitude). He is described as a wave function, wave packet, or tidal fie ld, or the ocean of dark matter and energy. Hestia's fire is described by the laws of therm odynamics. Electromagnetism is a hermaphroditic entity. Electricity = Hermes; magnetism = Aphrodite. Hermes also governs synchronicity which is the meaningful c ongruence of mind and matter. Flow is the confluence of mind and matter. Apollo is thermonuclear fission by which our sun creates light. Artem is is resonance, which manifests on the human level as empathy. Artemis/Apollo as twins symboliz e polarity, + or - charge. Mars = force, which is mass accelerating. It is tangential energy or vector quantity. Kinetic energy is momentum which is equivalent to mass x veloc ity. On the human level it is exertion or aggression. There are other correspondence s for natural philosophy. To understand is to transcend. On Thundergods and Thunderbolts. The universe is governed at a fundamental level by electromagnetic forces. Virtually every culture has preserved mem ory of a \"thundergod,\" a towering and tumultuous figure whose modus operandi is the generation of l ightning and the hurling of death-dealing thunderbolts from the sky. A prominent c haracter in ancient pantheons, shaman rites, and religious iconography, the thundergod often double s as a god of war. The Inca god Illapa is a case in point: \"Lightning in Inca religion was the m ajor theophany of the weather god, known as Ilyap'a, now usually hispanicized to Il lapa...Illapa was also the god of war, of trade, and god of death. It was represented as a constell ation outlining a man wielding a club in his left hand and a sling in his right .\" One of the most popular gods in North America is the so-called Thunderbir d, described as a towering bird spanning heaven. Numerous tribes preserve traditions of the bird that hurls lightning from heaven, bringing destruction and fire: \"The w ell-nigh universal American conception of the thunder is that it is caused by a bird or brood of birds—the"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"Thunderbirds. \"The concept of the thunderbird exists in Gran Chaco, i n Ecuador, and among the Caribbeans on the northern coast of the continent. The Egyptian Min offers an early example of the thundergod, his defining sym bol appearing already on predynastic pottery and rock art tracing to the fourth mill ennium BCE. In addition to serving as a god of storm and war, Min also featured prominent ly as an agent of fertility. The ancient Semitic thundergod Hadad/Adad, whose nam e is thought to be cognate with Arabic haddat, \"thunder,\" was likewise represented as a warrior. Illustrations of the long-haired and bearded god holding an axe and/or lightn ing are common throughout ancient Mesopotamia. Early epithets of the god, including B ir-qu, Lugal-ri-ha-mun, and Mer-ta-i-mu, identify him as the lightning, King of t he Hurricane, and thunderer respectively. Adad is elsewhere represented as a prom oter of fertility, a pattern we will discover in other thundergods around the world. Thus , an Assyrian prayer invokes Adad as follows: \"thunderer, splendid, mighty god, terror, dought y warrior, who wields lightning, master of the deluge...you make abundant greenery.\" The most familiar example of the thundergod is the Greek Zeus, whose r esemblance to Hadad was commonly acknowledged by the ancients themselves. Although th e cult of Zeus was subject to profound evolution, often to the extent that his original natur e was largely obscured, the portrait of the god offered by our earliest sources is consis tent and it conforms to that of an agent of thunder, lightning, wind and rain. It would als o appear likely that the archaic Zeus was a god of war. Burkert describes the Home ric Zeus as follows: \" Zeus, according to his Homeric epithets, is the cloud gatherer, the dark-cloude d, the thunderer on high, and the hurler of thunderbolts; in colloquial speech one can say 'Zeus is raining' instead of 'it is raining'; in Imperial times children were still singing, 'Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, on the fields of the Athenians...A direct epiphany of Zeus is lightn ing; wherever it strikes, a sanctuary is set up to Zeus Descending, Kataibates. It was as a thunderbol t that Zeus laid his fatal embrace on Semele. The thunderbolt...is the weapon of Zeus which he alone commands; it is irresistible, even gods tremble before it, and enemies of the gods are utterly destroyed when it strikes; in the face of such a manifestation of divine ene rgy, man stands powerless, terrified and yet marveling .\" In ancient Europe the thundergod occupies a prominent place in early p antheons. The Norse Thor was both thunderer and warrior. The god's name, cognate with the OH G Donar and Anglo-Saxon Thunor, derives from proto-Germanic *Thunaraz and signifi es \"thunder.\" Words formed with the god's name signified the weapons hur led from heaven. In Swedish lore, for example, thunderbolts were known as thorvigg or thorkil . The Finnish god Ukko shares numerous features in common with Thor. He, too, pr oduces the thunder and lightning while controlling the weather. The word ukk o, like its diminutive ukkonen, came to signify \"thunder.\" It has long been recognized that Thor f inds a close parallel in the Lithuanian Perkunas/Latvian Perkons, the latter god desc ribed as riding across the sky in a fiery chariot. The Slavic Perun offers an obvious cognate of Per kunas. Of the former god, it is known that his name came to signify a thunderbolt : \"In Slavic, perunu designates both 'thunderbolt' and 'thunder-god'.\""},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"Russian folklore describes Perun as a great dragon-slayer. Parjanya, a thunde rgod of ancient India, offers yet another cognate to the Baltic Perkunas. The Rig V eda paints a terrifying picture of the god: \"He smites the trees apart, he slays the d emons: all life fears him who wields the mighty weapon.\" Parjanya is described as wheeling ab out in heaven in his chariot, dispensing the fertilizing rains: Parjanya is elsewhere i dentified with Indra (8:6:1), the prototypical example of the Indo-European thundergod. Indeed, t he Vedic hymns describing Indra offer the most comprehensive portrait we have of the archaic thundergod. It is Indra who is said to have created the lightnings of heaven . The Divine Warrior's devastating thunderbolt is the subject of countless hymns in t he Rig Veda. One of the more curious beliefs surrounding the lightning holds that i t emanates from the region of the sun or, more specifically, from a sky-god's eye. This idea is well at tested in ancient Greece, where it was believed that Zeus could produce lightni ng from his eye. Aeschylus, for example, wrote as follows of the Greek thundergod: \"The je alous eye of God hurls the lightning down.\" The same conception is implicit in Eur ipedes' Bacchae: \"Unveil the Lightning's eye.\" Numerous scholars have observed that the image of Zeus casting lightning fr om his eye corresponds to a widespread belief. In Hindu tradition, for example, Shiva was said to have been capable of throwing lightning from his third eye, located in the cent er of his head. Association of the swastika with the sun-wheel is right on target, Thor's w eapon elsewhere being described as a fiery wheel. The connection between the (ancient ) sun and the swastika is universal in scope. The following tradition from the Ofo In dians of Florida is a case in point: \"The Ofo called the swastika design ila tata, or 'Sun middle .' A closely related conception views the lightning as generated from the \" wheel\" of the ancient sun-god. The Lithuanian Perkunas, for example, is said to have obtaine d his terrible weapon in the following manner: \"The source of the lightning i s the sun, the heavenly fire: the Thunder-god gets fire from the solar wheel by rotating h is lightning-club in the nave of the solar wheel.\" Thundergods are frequently linked to w heel-like objects in ancient art and ritual. A krater from Lecce shows Zeus set next to a wheel. I n addition to his thunderbolt, the Latin Jupiter was frequently depicted together with a wheel in Celtic iconography. The Celtic Taranis, whose name signifying \"thunder\" is cognate with that of the Norse Thor, is likewise pictured together with a wheel, prompting G reen to state with respect to Celtic iconography that \"the thunderbolt was a recurrent ass ociate of the wheel- sign.\" Also relevant here is a fact noted earlier: that Thor's thunderbolt was expressly compared to a fiery wheel. A wheel, especially a flaming one, is the symbol of thu nder, of Donar.\" The Greek Zeus was likewise intimately associated with the World Pil lar. Cook summarizes the evidence surrounding the Italian cult of Zeus at Tar entum as follows: \"Sacrifices were offered on pillars to the lightning-god Zeus Kataibates —a practice which, as we saw, had probably been inherited from 'Minoan' times. Apulian and Cam panian vases, also, represent Zeus fulminant on the top of a pillar. Altogether, it look s as though there were in south Italy an old belief that Zeus with his lightnings dwelt on high above an obvious tangible pillar, his vehicle and support.\""},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"The Greek hero Prometheus, whom Servius described as obtaining his fire from the sun's wheel, was said by Diodorus to have been the \"inventor of the fire-sticks , from which fire is kindled.\" Arthur Cook, while disavowing previous attempts to link the Greek hero's name to the Sanskrit term pramantha, \"fire drill,\" would nevertheless rel ate the latter term to an epithet of Zeus's: \"it is highly probable that pramantha the 'fire-dr ill' does explain Promantheus, a title under which Zeus was worshipped at Thourioi.\" A universal belief finds the thunderbolt (or lightning) regarded as a fertilizing force. Indeed, the idea is so common in ancient myth and modern folklore that it is usually taken for granted as if it somehow makes sense in terms of the customary behavior of lightning. The thunderbolt's striking the earth, together with the accompanying r ain, is thought to \"fertilize\" or \"inseminate\" the earth. The Desana Indians of Colombi a, for example, hold that \"lightning...is a fertilizing force that impregnates the earth wit h its crystal-semen.\" More precisely, the lightning is regarded as the Sun's ejaculation or seme n or, with specific reference to the latter's eye, as a \"fertilizing glance.\" Nearly every Old World thundergod doubles as an agent of fertility. Marija Gim butas described the Lithuanian Perkunas as follows: \"The earth is barren until the Thunder strikes her in the springtime—until in his epiphany of thunder Per kunas weds the Mother Earth, Zemyna.\" Such beliefs, according to Gimbutas, \"are universal [among th e Balts and Slavs] and certainly stem from very early times.\" Ancient conceptions of the thunderbolt as fecundator or impregater, some of which survived well into modern times. T hus it is that Thor was frequently invoked at weddings, the god's thunderbolts formin g a prominent feature of many a bridegroom's attire: \"In certain parts of Norway and Sweden , it continued to be the custom for a bridegroom to bear an axe at the wedding long aft er Thor was forgotten; the weapon was said to give him mastery, and also to ensure a fruitf ul union.\" A widespread tradition locates the thundergod at the center or \"heart\" of heaven. Thus, the Semitic thunderer Adad was said to roar in \"the heart of heaven,\" th e latter site being that wherein the ancient sun-god both \"rose\" and \"set.\" Similar ideas ar e apparent in the Finnish cult of Ukko. An interesting epithet of the god's was \"navel of t he sky,\" thought to link the thundergod with the polar region or Pole star itself. The Navaho thu ndergod Nayanezgani is likewise said to have lived in the center of the world. So, too, is th e Vedic Parjanya, described as follows in the Rig Veda: \"Parjanya is the Father of the Mighty Bird: on mountains, in earth's centre hath he made his home.\" The Quic he thundergod Jurakan was called by the epithet U C'ux Caj, \"Heart of the Sky.\" Jurakan was t he highest deity in the Quiche pantheon and he was credited with being the \"sour ce of all energy and life in the universe.\" Indeed, it was his union with the earth that initiated Creation. The cyclone, a term that originated from the Greek kyklos, meaning 'wheel' or 'circle', and was modified to kykloma that signifies 'wheel' or 'coil of a snake', is define d as 'a storm or system of winds that rotates about a center of low atmospheric pressure cloc kwise in the Southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the North...The tornad o, from Latin: tornare, 'to turn in a lathe', and also influenced by the Spanish words tornad o: 'turned' or 'returned' and tronada: 'thunderstorm', is a 'violent destructive whi rlwind accompanied by a funnel-shaped cloud...\" Most significant is the intimate relationsh ip between the"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"whirling winds and an \"eye-like\" or \"wheel-like\" form, reminisc ent of our earlier discussion of swastika-forms. To sum up our survey of thundergod lore to this point: the thundergod is inext ricably associated with the ancient sun-god, in ancient myth as well as in sacred iconography. The god's lightning is said to emanate from the region of the sun or from a celes tial eye. We are not the first to notice this connection between the sun and the thund ergod. Morris Jastrow, the great Assyriologist, observed that: \"In many mythologies the sun and ligh tning are regarded as correlated forces.\" Arthur Cook, similarly, concluded: \"The s un-god has much in common with the thunder-god.\" CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS Jehovah, I AM (Hebrew) Brahma, Indra (Hindu) Jupiter (Roman) Amoun-Ra, Osiris (Egyptian) Woton (Nordic) King Arthur (Celtic) Sun Pin, Lei-kung (Chinese) Marduk (Babylonian) Quetzalcoatl, (Aztec) Great Spirit (Native American) CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLES All of the great philosophers world-wide, including Pythagoras, Plato, Socr ates, Aristotle, Confucious, Lao-Tzu, etc. The sagacious King Solomon; King Henry VIII of England with his numerous wives.

DIALOGUE WITH ZEUS We can tap into Zeus' wisdom for personal guidance in our daily life. Zeus was not only considered an abstract Olympian god, but also a daimon (or mediator) on a person al level. In other words, he functions as an inner guide for the mortals who call on hi m. His realm involves the entire cycle of human fate; he is the determiner of our uniq ue individual destinies, delivering what we have earned through our actions. Are we empow ered, or disempowered? As dispenser of human fate, Zeus reigns like an almighty god. We contact Zeus when we can \"see through\" the events of our daily lives to a m ore fundamental level. On the psychological level, Zeus appears as the \"meaning\" which lights up our personal experience. For great events, there is a correspondingly p rofound insight. Sudden insight may be compared to a quantum leap in consciousness. Zeus can be a wise and philosophical father figure for us--mentor, r ole model, and authority symbol. The purpose of the father image is to challenge us into fur ther exploration and growth. He provides the support that helps us to meet the c hallenges of becoming an individual in our own right or becoming whole. If we lacked this guidance as a child, we may have to re-father ourselves. A fath er encourages us to find our place in the world and develop social consciousne ss. He counsels us to choose a career where we may be effective, and successful. The positive father-complex expresses in an attitude of extroverted ent husiasm for life. With a positive father image, we are eager to learn, comprehend, and experien ce many facets of life. The positive father counsels one to maintain an objective, lon g-range viewpoint which is based on wisdom and consideration for others. Seek the philosophical objectivity of Zeus, his insights, and divine wis dom. Seek his paternal nurturing. He symbolizes the archetype of the Self or Universal Mind manifesting in individuals as their fullest extension and actualization of potential . He is pure creative energy. Mass is \"crystallized\" energy. We come from Light and return to that Li ght, according to the testimony of physicists and mystics, alike. Meditate on that Light, and become it. ZEUS IN YOUR LIFE 1.

CHAPTER XI: ADJUSTMENT THEMIS Themis is the daughter of Gaea and Uranus, the Earth Mother, and the Ancien t of Days. She is one of the few Titans who survives in full power in the Olympian e ra of the rule of Zeus. The Greeks saw her as the embodiment of the concept of connected ness. She represents the abstract principle of absolute Justice, Law, or Adju stment. To the Hindus, this is known as the Law of Karma. To the psychotherapist, it means natural consequences. The psychological drive of this archetype is the force of volition, pranic force , or spiritual power associated with the breath of life. It is an urge toward growth, increas e, and personal effectiveness, guided from above. The motto of this stage is that, \"Equili brium is the secret of the Great Work.\" The equivalent of this metaphysical principle in psychology is Jung's con cept of compensation. The unconscious contains the perspectives on life whi ch balance the conscious attitudes. They are revealed through dreams, moods, and behavior. Thi s interplay of opposites shows complimentary forces balancing one another. Thi s paradoxical union of opposites was reflected in the ancient worship of Themis at her primary cult site, Rhamnus. Her dark or shadow side was also honored there, as Nemesis. Jane Ellen Harrison, in her definitive work on Themis, traces her bac k through her history as a matriarchal tribal Goddess. She originally represented an organizing fu nction. For this reason, she remained a trusted counsellor to Zeus. He sought her opinions i n matters of decision before, during, and after their marriage (before the arrival of H era). Their union is said to have produced the three Fates (among others) as their offsprin g. The Fates spin, weave, and cut the thread of life."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"Themis is inevitably linked strongly with her mother Gaea. As a variation on the theme of Great Mother, Themis represented the earth-goddess of unshak able power because she is the absolute, inexorable Law. The undeviating patterns of Themis keep even the gods themselves within certain boundaries. When Themis is associated with her mother's earthiness she is called Ge-Themis. She is to be distinguished from the agrarian world of growth, which is the province of Demeter. She represents a deeper, psychic \"grounding\" of an individual, group, or comm unity. Each physical place on earth has its particular cyclic rhythm which strikes a deeper note than the mere passing of seasons. This spiritual ground gives birth to local rit uals and laws, which form the basis of cultural distinctions. The governing maternal p rinciple guarantees fertility. The spiritual side of Themis can be distinguished from the more phys ical aspects through examining her oracular nature. Themis was known for her mantic powers. As t he law of justice, she should certainly be able to perceive the future through extrapolating from cause and effect. Oracles were the most revered form of divination in th e ancient world. They commanded great respect and awe. Legend has it that Themis inspired and informed the priestesses at D elphi. These priestesses sat over a fissure which emitted strong fumes. The fis sure was in a cave. Under the influence of intoxicating vapors, the women uttered their prognosti cations in cryptic language. Themis received her oracular power from her mother who had the same p ower. Her mother gave her the oracle at Delphi as a gift. According to myth, she later pas sed on the patronage of Delphi to Apollo. Themis also has a heavenly, or celestial character, as head of the \"Supreme Court .\" On Mt. Olympus, she is the one who summons the gods to counsel, even though Zeus pres ides over them. Themis, however, does preside over all the feasts, or banquets, where gr oup members gather together. The Greeks held a three-day rite in honor of Themis in October, a month as sociated with her sign Libra. Known as the Thesmophoria, it is associated with Demeter/ Persephone, also. But it also acknowledges Themis and her underlying laws. Like the gr eat oracle at Delphi, the Thesmophoria is associated with a fissure or crack in the e arth, opening into the depths. PHYSICAL FORM The origins of Themis as Titan of remote times indicates that she is a f undamental component of the materiality of the universe, and an instinctual force in the human personality. Born from Gaea (materiality), she may be envisioned as \"the laws of nature\" concerning material phenomena. These physical laws are the patterning pr inciples of manifest existence, and human life, as well. These laws represent the ecology of the macrocosm and microcosm. They are b ased on efficiency, minimal motion, and dynamic equilibrium. Physical laws i nclude those of"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"gravitation, planetary motion, angular momentum, motion, inertia, reactions, fall ing bodies, acceleration, etc. Conservation is a recurrent keyword, such as \"conse rvation of energy,\" \"conservation of matter,\" \"conservation of momentum,\" \"conservation of e lectric charge,\" etc. There are also laws of wave behavior, probability, probable population densitie s for molecules, and symmetry. These last laws are important for quantum mechanic s, which reveals an indeterminate universe distinctly different from the mechanistic Newtonian mechanics of local cause and effect. Though Newton's inverse square law of gr avitation seems mechanistic, Newton himself felt it a philosophical imperati ve to discover the \"first- cause\" (which is non-mechanical) before deducing causes from effect s. Since the laws of physics seem to be overthrown periodically by new dis coveries, how can we trust in the concept of absolute \"laws\" of nature? Themis underl ies reality, patterning matter through dynamic equilibrium, no matter what mankind's current evaluation of her laws may be. When \"new laws\" are discovered, we are receiving further revel ations of Themis. The principle of indeterminacy or uncertainty shows Themis f rozen in the moment of judgement or decision, forever on the verge of rendering her verdict. The principle laws of Newtonian mechanics were published in 1687 and i ncluded the following in a definitive concept of interaction: LAW OF INERTIA: A body at rest will remain at rest, or a body in motion will c ontinue in motion in a straight line with constant speed, unless constrained to chan ge that state by the action of an exterior force. LAW OF ACCELERATION: Change of a body's motion is proportional to any force acting upon it, and in the exact direction of that force. LAW OF REACTION: Every acting force is always opposed by an equal and opposite reacting force. LAW OF GRAVITATION: Every particle of matter in the universe attr acts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and varying as the inverse square of the distance between their centers. Science still seeks that elusive axiom known as THE UNIFIED FIELD T HEORY which would unite both mechanistic and quantum models, or classical and quantum physics. Carl Jung might have been commenting on the psycho-physical nature of Themis whe n he stated that, \"If research could only advance far enough. . .we should arrive at an ultimate agreement between physical and psychological concepts.\" Themis underlies the laws of thermodynamics: 1st law of thermodynamics = principle of conservation of energy; 2nd law of thermodynamics = entropy (energy converts from more to less ord erly form). Negentropy = Themis = orderly patterning principle. Occupations associated with Themis include:"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"attorney councilman detective D.A. ecologist judge juror librarian paralegal physicist policeman referee senator collective bargainer EMOTIONAL IMAGE Continuing with Jung's psycho-physical notion, we find that, \"Psyche can not be totally different from matter, for otherwise how could it move matter? And matter cannot be alien to psyche, for how else could matter produce psyche? Psyche and matter exi st in the same world, and each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal action would be impossible.\" Themis is the principle of reciprocal action. On the emotional level this translates into the give and take of daily life. We ar e again confronted with the principle of attraction and repulsion, but in the arena of human relationships, rather than atomic substances. Themis encourages the development of a balanced personality, one which re cognizes both outer (material) and inner (psychic) realities. A balanced personalit y honors both introversion and extroversion, reserving each for appropriate times and situ ations. The balanced person divides their time between householder's duties an d obligations and spiritual needs. Themis has a preference for judging, as compared with perceiving. Judging and p erceiving types are naturally distributed about 50-50 in the general population. Judging i s not synonymous with judgmental, but reflects a style ofapprehending reality. Jud gers prefer closure to keeping options open and fluid. They feel a sense of urgency bef ore pending decisions, and a sense of ease and satisfaction once it is made. Judgers establish and work toward deadlines, and expect others to do the same . This can be a source of misunderstanding, since not everyone is driven by a work ethic that supercedes rest and recreation. Their main drive is to get the job done , get the show on the road. Their shadow-side can be critical of other types, accusing them of be ing aimless or procrastinating. They exert pressure on themselves and others. They may leap t o premature conclusions before all evidence is in."},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Themis provides a sense of proportion in one's self and life. She repre sents the strength and force that suspends all action pending decision. She represents th e completion of education, once it is followed up with applied effort, action and work. When all of humankind remained in the sway of Themis, the collective u nconscious was so utterly dominant that few thought of transgressing the Law. Besides th e threat of being banished or shunned, there was an instinctual inhibition. This was i n the Golden Age before religion (Zeus) narrowed the psychic field down to the values of ego-consciousness. There is a relationship between the law and boundaries, and personal boundaries. This is the basis of respect and propriety. In safe situations, or ritual, it is OK to l et go of the boundaries of ordinary existence and experience ecstatic oneness. But the No Boundaries condition is only safe in a society supportive of this state of consciousnes s and geared to inducing it and guiding the experience, or giving it particular value throu gh initiation. It is direct experience of the transpersonal dimension beyond, and ontologicall y prior to ego- consciousness. It is the realm of \"natural law\" and brotherhood, a transper sonal value. Themis came to represent control through social contracts among people . Themis could see through to the truth of situations. She holds the scales of justice, like the Egyptian goddess Maat, weighing the truth of the heart. Principles of fair treatment unde r the law and egalitarianism are her \"divine will.\" When that contract is broken by a nat ion, organizations like Amnesty International intervene, attempting to provide at voice for the values of Themis. They stand-in as a transnational conscience supporting hu man rights. Themis acts on us through the natural consequences of our behavior. Sometime s we know what is right, but do what we feel like and suffer the consequences. So metimes the judgment comes quickly, sometimes slowly. The transpersonalequivalen t of natural consequences is the principle of Karma. It operates in the emotional or s ocial sphere, by requiring that every \"doer\" receives the exact result, or reward of thei r actions. This is the same law of cause and effect known in physics as the law of compensation. In employment it is the principle of fair wages and collective bargain ing. In business, it is the basis of the fair market value, the \"square deal.\" We act foolishly if we i gnore the law of compensation and try to get \"something for nothing.\" There is an exact balance of accounts and precise compensation for each and every act, according to Themi s- consciousness. This alone should be enough to make us careful not to hu rt the feelings of others. What goes around, comes around, according to folk wisdom. Themis might have coined the Golden Rule: \" Do unto others ...\" The proper understanding of the law of karma is a perfect solution to our s ocial and economic difficulties. Greedy or profit-mad individuals spend mass ive amounts of action and energy amassing fortunes, while the poor majority languish. We are cultural ly conditioned into a consumer ethic by the media and Madison Avenue. This is an unnatural trance state from which we can awaken. The \"Greed is good,\" mentality of th e 80s is obsolete in the 90s.

The moral tone of Themis insures that there is no blind rip-off, wit hout an eventual accounting.

These other viewpoints represent subpersonalities within our ch aracter."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"It is in the nature of psychological complexes to suddenly switch int o their opposites in a process termed enantiodromia. This 180 degree switch is the basis for th e principle of rehabilitation, or reform. It is literally a re-forming of attitudes and though t-patterns, influencing values and priorities. An example from THE BIBLE is the conversion of the crassly materialistic Saul into a spiritual man-of-God, Paul. On a lower arc of personality, the same happens in recovery for reformed alcoholics and criminals. The law of compensation is the basis of \"rebirth\" phenomena. It represents the return swing of pendulum. Themis enc ourages a balanced personality rather than radical, over-reactive mood swings. They are symptomat ic of an underlying imbalance. According to Jung, the ideal of spiritual striving for the heights is inexorab ly linked with a materialistic, earth-bound passion to conquer matter and master th e world. The archetype of the Self expresses its paradoxical quality through radically opposite change s in the conscious attitude. These 180 degree changes of attitude are to be expected, rather than appear as a su rprise. It is the pattern of oscillation, and indicates values in flux. Contradictory at titudes held by the unconscious intrude suddenly into the conscious attitude of dai ly life. Sometimes it is the conscience calling, sometimes the voice of the shadow. It require s discrimination, and wise behavior to respond to such forces. This good/bad paradox is embodied in the alter-ego of Themis, known as Nemes is. Nemesis-consciousness is characterized by pessimism and negativity --an \"I told you so\" attitude. She is the goddess of doom and gloom, the proverbial \"chip on the shoul der.\" She is the shadow-side of Themis. Another shadow of judgement is guilt--t he result of self- judgement. Guilt is the flip side of conscience. It manifests from a wounded conscience. The SUPEREGO is a Freudian notion of an unconscious conscience, whic h metes out punishment and reward to the ego, like a critical parent. It is based in un conscious law, which in no way resembles the cultural codes we have developed to protec t the innocent. The Superego is a transpersonal force, but when it is debased it functi ons through the subpersonality or complex we call the Inner Judge. Inner justice is far le ss egalitarian than external justice which is regulated by cultural checks and balances. This judge is severe. Unconscious justice has only one aim: punishment an d refusal of pleasure. Its nature is anti-hedonistic. In its view, \"you exist, theref ore you are guilty.\" This syndrome is accentuated in the psyche if the parents are rejecti ng, critical, or didn't want a child to begin with. A critical inner judge condemns human frailty. In unconscious law the t hought is equivalent to the deed, and the punishment is to be bound in the chains of neurosis. Thus we punish ourselves for crimes never executed in reality--crime s of unconscious fantasy. The superego knows every secret, every unconscious wish, every inner defen se. Its punishments are severe--disproportionate to the \"crime.\" The inner District Attorney \"throws the book\" at the offender. Punishment comes in the form of dep ression, dissatisfaction, self-reproach, and sometimes suicide."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"The inner court does not believe in the principle of double jeopardy. You c an be retried an infinite amount of times for the same infraction. The judgment of conscie nce is final. There are no paroles, or \"time off for good behavior.\" The inner jury is prejudiced an d cannot be challenged. In the internal law court, the judge's code is also Lewis Carroll's: \"I'l l be judge, I'll be jury, said cunning old Fury; I'll try the whole cause and condemn you to death.\" The inner lawyer or unconscious ego is impotent in the realm of the inner judge, becaus e the ego seeks first to protect itself. In other words, the unconscious ego will never dare to fight for full acquittal. In THE SUPEREGO , Edmund Bergler comments on the transcultural nature of the inner judge: The superego's purpose is exclusively the individual's misery; its lab el of \"forbidden\" and \"positively punishable\" is attached both to cultural taboos and to actions acce pted by the environment. Inner conscience is not concerned with the maintenance of taboos; inner conscience recognizes the taboos only for the purpose of misusing them. In e veryculture, therefore, people torture themselves unconsciously, regardless of th e fact that the external \"don'ts\" are fastened to different prohibitions. Themis is the divine vengeance of the karmic law. In THE BOOK OF THOTH , Aleister Crowley admonishes the aspirant to \"Balance against each thought its exact opposi te; for the marriage of these is the Annihilation of Illusion.\" We are neither of the opposing thought-patterns. They are archetypal patterns playing through us. But our ego tends to identify clingingly to one or another of them at alt ernative times. Nemesis makes the necessary karmic adjustments for our behavior when we fail to negate illusive thoughts through meditation. Sometimes this manifests through inexplicable self-defeating or self-destructive behavior. Sometimes we don't fee l we deserve or earn our success. This may be observant or it may be neurotic, an imbalanced evaluation. Th emis- consciousness restores the state of equilibrium Nemesis, the negative manifestation of Themis, is stasis or stagnation. In this consciousness, energies cancel one another our. On the psychological level, we might see how Ne mesis makes sure that any thought or projected desire will return in time to in fluence the sender. Because of the psychological \"boomerang effect\" which even Jung noted, we sh ould be very careful about projecting harmful thoughts toward others. As the occultist s suggest, these energies can come home to roost. The launching of destructive thoughts is observed by this subconscious aspect of Self we know as Themis. It knows all and responds accordingly, affirming the ancien t law of cause and effect. She also chastises us into fulfilling our duty and destiny, ou r spiritual potential, and our physical potential. She works on all the planes--spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and p hysical. Themis helps us develop a spirit of \"give and take.\" She counsels moderation in all things including archetypal obsessions, being \"carried away\" by the force of a god. When we are rapt away, willy-nilly, from daily life, these \"divine obsessions\" make for very narrow personalities."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"We can be consumed by identification with pure archetypal force, oblite rating our finely balanced personality. Themis helps us regain balance. According to Denning and Phillips in THE MAGICAL PHILOSOPHY , \" Justice is that quality, compounded of moral force and constructive purpose, which goads the sluggish mind and body to great achievement. This is the torpid serpent aroused to almost rampant vitality. Justice is the virtue of duty and the art of summoning power through creation of n eed. \" Justice represents the testing aspects of situation. The magickal aspect of Themis includes the balancing of male and female, act ive and passive, right and left sides of the brain, and other opposites. This result s, theoretically, in a mystical state of androgyny. We see this force released in our society, more and more, as the old cultu ral boundaries and role models break down. Now woman can become professionals, men may be househusbands. Both participate and share more in the responsibilit ies and duties of life. Themis brings us whatever it takes to balance out our individual psyches . She is the irresistible urge in this direction. Further reading on Themis may be found in, THEMIS, Jane Ellen Harrison JUNG AND TAROT, Sallie Nichols, York Beach, Weiser, 1980. LAROUSSE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MYTHOLOGY, Robert Graves, Hamlin, London , 1978. SPIRITUAL MYTH The spirituality of Themis is expressed through acceptance of self, oth ers, and nature. It is an extension of the transpersonal principle of brotherly love to the whole Creation. Its offspring is the sense of Destiny, one's rightful place in the univer sal scheme of things. It feels almost as if we are magnetized in a particular direction. Accepting our selves with our faults means we can maturely accept the wor ld as it is. This means we develop past the egocentric stage and identity crisis toward ma turity and a better balance. This was one of Abraham Maslow's indicators of self-actualization. A nother was the sense of brotherly love or humanitarianism. It comes from the feel ing that we are one with the Family of Man. Themis also appears as the impartial \"Witness\" allow ing us to objectively evaluate ourselves free of the bias of temporary emotions. Spiritual masters tell us that karma (or actions) rightly performed can l ead to spiritual emancipation. Usually this involves some sort of SEVA , or transpersonal service. Right livelihood is also a necessary choice. Their criteria for what constitutes a \" good\" or \"bad\" action is simple: Good deeds take us nearer to our spiritual goal, while b ad deedstend to take us farther away from it. When we are healthy, we naturally wish to adhere to the \"good\" because rediscove ring our true selves yields the pleasure of finding our identities reflect ed in a pleasant environment. This is the result of serendipity. We expect good, and generally find it re flected back to us."},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"Yet we realize that the world is not necessarily fair. We chase a myth if w e feel that \"justice always triumphs.\" It's only realistic to realize that bad things can and d o happen to good people. Since all life is characterized by activity and change is the law of life, it is considered best to sublimate the chosen course of our actions. Thus, we ennoble them, or put our \"BTUs\" of psychic energy where they count most. To be path of liberation, karma must satisfy three conditions: 1). Respect and adoration for the true knowledge of the higher values of life. 2). A sincere and loving feeling toward all living beings, corporeal and incorporeal (includes entities of \"higher\" planes, archetypes, forces of nature). V egetarianism is an integral value of this attitude. Why would one kill for food or sport, when the re are other options besides dishonoring the value of life? 3). Karma is to be performed without the desire for recognition or reward. It should be performed with a spontaneous, active will, which flows from each one's un ique nature (or personal sense of duty). These are the simple pleasures of work which is under no restraint or compulsion. It fulfills itself directly through the medium of necessity in that particular t ime and place. Man functions in harmony with the environment and destiny. There is no set w ay which is right for all; the \"right man\" may perform the \"wrong action': and the \"wrong man\" may perform what is necessary, through spontaneity. This brings up the issue of situational ethics. Jung considered moralit y an instinctive regulator of action. When we hold strong values, we are willing to speak out about them and act to uphold them. The law of karma is like that of action and reaction. It re turns the legitimate results of our actions to us, in spite of our efforts to avoid them. W e reap what we have sown, as the axiom states. The law of karma is only in effect up to the region where mind and matter ce ase. It is the law of manifestation because every entity in the manifest universe is in action, thus creating karma. Beyond the realm of spacetime and causality, the spiritual world operate s on the law of love(the Eros principle in its cosmological sense). But in our human realm of mind and matter, karma is universal. Many cultures of the world have believed in the theory of the transmigration of souls, including the Pythagoreans, Hebrews, and Hindus. It was expunged from THE BIBLE by a Byzantine queen, whose karma was very dark. There is no way of escaping the worki ngs of karma, according to these. Reincarnation and metempsychosis are companion concepts. They assert th at if a man's karmic accounts are not settled at the time of his death, he has neither defeated nor mocked the law. He must return in another form to make payment accordi ng to his actions, desires and attachments."},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"Even if we don't subscribe to literal reincarnation, it is easy to see that we recycle issues by drawing on imagery from the Collective Unconscious which relates to ou r unresolved problems and conflicts. We draw from the genetic and subconscious store of mankind's experience for responses to what happens in our lives. These psychic \"d ownloads\" may appear in the form of so-called past lives, and therapy on the entities and iss ues found there is often very helpful. Past life exploration is a fruitful area for exploring u nresolved issues. As long as the soul is exiled from God, according to Jewish tradition, we must submit to the guidance of the Law. Redemption only occurs when everything is restored to i ts pristine condition through human acts. The redemptive mission of the Boddhisatva, or Wor ld Savior, is also based on this notion that no one is free until we all are transf ormed.

She is healthy skepticism in balance with Themis. She he lps us achieve balance, and fair assessments of each event as a unique phenomena. In terms of psychological complexes, Nemesis-consciousness is persistent and obst inate, and difficult to drive out. Rather than denying her, she needs the balancing remedy of her si ster's gentler perception. Nemesis was at first a moral idea about the inexorable equilibrium of the h uman condition. Her consciousness is the \"great leveler,\" divine anger. Divine wrath in ancient times came from offending moral law or making the gods jealous from acquiring an excess of good fortune through little effort. The gods required propitiation through a s acrifice or they sent unhappiness (Nemesis) to plague the person. Nemesis saw that order was maintained. One of her methods was an injunct ion of silence to avoid attracting divine anger. Today we might say that not boasting of one's excessive good fortune doesn't bring down the wrath of the gods on an over-inflated ego-con sciousness.

CHAPTER XII: THE HANGED MAN POSEIDON Poseidon was the eldest son of Rhea and Cronos, and he vied for his portion of rul ership over creation with his brothers Zeus and Hades. His apportioned lot becam e the rulership of all waters, oceans, and the dominion over earth. In fact, he is the earthy version of Zeus, manifesting in concrete, rather than celestial form. Like Zeus, he is described as having jet-black hair and being powerfull y muscular. His sacred animals include the horse, the ram, white bull, and all aquatic cre atures, but the dolphin is his particular favorite. Poseidon corresponds with Neptune and Trump XII, THE HANGED MAN. Thi s \"hanged man\" is the execution of the judgment of the previous trump. He is not suf fering. In its transformative capacity, Neptune-consciousness symbolizes an inversi on in awareness. It is a reversal of the superficial view of life to one in which the true spiri tual nature of the universe is perceived through superconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"This hyperconsciousness is symbolized as \"water,\" but it is also mind s tuff. This is the water of life. Cosmic Consciousness means that since you and the universe are one, that awareness is inherent within you. THE HANGED MAN implies the susp ension of personal actions (Trump XI, Adjustment) during the ecstatic state, which is ac hieved through concentration. Though Neptune-consciousness is boundless and non-material, it flows in its own direction. When this aspect is emphasized there are demands on us to subordinate or sacrifice our personal desires and feelings and flow willingly with the current of the stream of life. It is a consciousness where the mind and senses are suspended in Samadhi. The thoughts are brought to a standstill in meditation, usually by the repetition of a mantra. Poseidon-consciousness is oceanic. There are two types of oceanic experien ce: intuitive oceanic and feeling oceanic. It is immersion in the ocean of spirit. [see P SYCHETYPES, Michael Malone] In consciousness journeys, we find Poseidon in the imagery of being suck ed into the maelstrom, the turbulent motion of the whirlpool. Other images of Po seidon are the twisting of a tornado, or the violence of a hurricane or powerful tidal wave, flas h flood, or roiling river. \"Becoming\" the essence of these powerful forces, we connect with Pos eidon-consciousness, rather than haphazardly remaining its victim. By not resisting, we are drawn i nto the depths. Worship of Poseidon originated with the Indo-European group of people, know n as Aryans, who later migrated down into Greece and spread as far as northern In dia. To them he was known by the name Poteidan, and was associated with his mate called Da Mater, who became known as Demeter in classical Greece. These people kn ew little of the world's great oceans and considered their god one of very potent generative power . The sexual aspect of Poseidon is shown by his representation as a horse, bull , ram, or bear; these are all symbols of power, instinctuality, and fertility. Poseidon, as c onsort of the earth, was thought to fertilize her with his waters, much as sperm fert ilizes the female. As a principle of fertility and fecundation, he was seen as the active agen t behind germination and gestation of both plant and animal life. Plants don't sprout without water , and both plants and animals suffer during drought. His great strength was synonymous with virility, and he therefore had many lover s. In time, his sexual prowess came to symbolize not only the power to bring lif e forces into physical manifestation, but also authority and social position. It came to mean having power over the lives of others. Breeding and biological propagation, or reproductive power became transmuted into personal power. The Poseidon-type of personalit y became an \"Earth-shaker\", not only in the literal sense, but a \"mover and shaker\" in soc iety. As the eldest of the ruling brothers, Poseidon is sovereign in his earthl y third of the world. The Poseidon personality wields the same sort of authority and effectiven ess today. He represents political or economic power in the business world, rathe r than a spiritual or"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"intellectual force. Dreams of tidal waves, earthquakes, and wild horses r eflect an activation of the Poseidon principle. The earth is where the light and dark realms of Zeus and Hades meet. Where light and dark mix is a land of shadows, and this also shows in the Poseidon character. Hi s strong instinctuality shows that he really has more in common with Hades than with Zeus. He is connected with the color black, and a darkening of the Light of ego-consciousn ess. The more ego-consciousness seeks to express contempt for, or demean, ear thborn instincts, the more powerfully Poseidon will attack. The instincts want equal at tention and interaction in life. They prevent the ego from drying up due to lack of mois ture. The HANGED MAN means the suspension of ego-consciousness, the usurpin g younger brother Zeus. Poseidon was the father of strange and frightening children, including t he Cyclops and Medusa. Part of his essential nature is linked with the primordial Gr eat Goddess, as shown by his affinity for the ocean, and being under water, submerged in the s ubconscious. He indicates that at the heart of reality, next to Zeus, lives something always c onsorting with darkness--restless, sometimes serene, sometimes evil, and very pote nt. The arrival of potent Poseidon imagery touches on knowledge--physical, fantas y and meditative knowledge. On the psychological level, Poseidon is the overwhelmi ng power of the collective unconscious which can erupt from the depths of the psyche at any time. He is a definite push on the part of the unconscious to encourage the con scious mind to insist on the personal space and independence needed to further psyc hic development. Poseidon is always present deep within the psyche in latent form, aris ing periodically to shake up our ordinary life. One confronts the shadow internally and in its \"acting out\", again and again. Posei don projects his violent nature; this energy is untamed and often unhelpfu l and should be related to instinct. He also expresses his aggressive tendencies in se xuality. He is the royalty of primal sexual energy. He expresses the depth and divinity of human sexu ality. Poseidon has a religious meaning. The God is dark as well as light. He is descri bed as brooding and tumultuous. He has a revolutionary spirit which dissolves old p aradigms without forming new ones. In this sense, Poseidon-consciousness is li ke the operation of solutio in alchemy--a dissolution of the old structure in preparation for an adaptive change. The Feminine is the mediator to the deep energies of Poseidon, there fore we usually find him with one of his numerous mistresses. The Goddess always appears wi th him. This is a summons to experience the Feminine. We are called to explore and honor th e unconscious, the oceanic world of right-brain experience. This relatedness joins w hat was separated, connects us to others and the Other (or Not-I) via the feminine way.

Cosmologists baffled by the apparent evidence that the Universe is younger than the stars it contains may have been guilty of reading too much into our immediate surroundin gs in the Universe. According to a group of Chinese researchers, the problem is that w e live in a low- density bubble which is not typical of the Universe at large. When the ap propriate measurements are made on large enough scales, everything slots into place. The kind of scales cosmologists deal with are much greater than the dist ances between stars. They are interested in the distance between clusters of galaxies , and regard a whole galaxy of several hundred billion stars, like ou Milky Way, merely as a \"test parti cle\" in the Universe at large. Stars are useful in one respect to cosmologists. The age s of the oldest stars in our Galaxy are at least 12 billion years, and obviously the Universe must be older than the stars it contains. The puzzle, highlighted by recent observatio ns using the Hubble Space Telescope, is that the simplest interpretation of measuremen ts of the distances to nearby clusters of galaxies and the rate at which they are moving apart suggests th at the Universe started expanding from a point (the Big Bang) only 8 billion years ago. But this interpretation depends, among other things, on the assumption th at the Universe contains exactly enough matter, overall, for gravity to one day bring the expansion to a halt. This critical density is required by the detailed theory of the Bi g Bang, called inflation, which most cosmologists favour. If the density of the Universe is less than the critical density, it alters the dynamics of the situation and extends estimates of the age of the Universe. The key question, which has not really been considered much b y cosmologists until now, is how typical the region of the Universe over which we can mak e these measurements is. Our local bubble of space may not give us enough information t o predict the behaviour of the entire Universe. Xiang-Ping Wu, of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, and several colleagues, su ggest in a paper to be published in the Astrophysical Journal that this is indee d the case. They point out that although this kind of study of the Universe extends out to d istances of a few hundred million light years, if the measurements made for clusters at different distances are analysed separately, instead of all being lumped together to give one aver age figure, they show that the density of matter in the Universe increases the furt her out we look. On a scale of about 30 million light years, the density os only 10 per cent of the critical value, while on a scale of 300 million light years it may be as much as 90 per cent of the c ritical value. The direct implication of this is that on the scale over which recent m easurements of the expansion of the Universe have been made, the expansion rate (given by the so -called Hubble constant) is bigger than the overall average expansion rate by as much as 40 pe r cent. That means that the age of the Universe has bee underestimated by 40 p er cent, which is almost exactly the correction needed to boost the age from about 8 billion years to about 12 billion years, matching the ages of the oldest stars."},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"According to John Gribbon, astronomers congratulating themselves on having disc overed what our Milky Way Galaxy is made of have had to cancel the celebrations. Their observations, suggesting that the bright stars of our Galaxy are embedded in a hal o of thousands of billions of dark stars, are as good as ever. But unfortunately, a com pletely different series of observations implies that there simply are not enou gh atoms available to make all those dark stars. There is a conflict, and both suggestions cannot be r ight. But the good news is that this kind of conflict usually leads (sooner or later) to an im provement in our understanding of the Universe. The more astronomers studied the Universe, the more evidence the y found for the presence of matter that could not be detected by any form of radiation. Even dark matter exerts a gravitational influence on its surroundings, and studies of the way individ ual galaxies rotate, and of the way groups of galaxies move together in clusters, showed that th ere was a lot more matter around than met the eye, tugging on its bright companions. Obviously, there is bound to be some dark matter around -- but by the end of th e 1980s it was clear that there was at least ten times more dark stuff than bright stuff in the Universe. For nearly 400 years, astronomers had been studying the tip of the proverbial ic eberg. Now, they were eager to study the rest of it. But how? In the absence of any obser vations of the dark stuff, theorists had a field day coming up with wild and wacky (and sometimes serious) suggestions about what it might be. The most extreme suggestion was that some form of fundamental particles, never detected in laboratories on Earth, mi ght have been produced in profusion in the Big Bang in which the Universe was born, an d fill the \"empty space\" between the stars and galaxies. Such particles would have to have mass, or they would not exert a gravitational pu ll; otherwise, though, they would interact only weakly with ordinary atoms. So they we re dubbed WIMPs -- Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. A typical WIMP wou ld weigh about as much as a light atom -- perhaps half as much as a carbon atom. If there are a many as would be required to explain the motions of galaxies, large numbers are whizzing through the room you are sitting in, and through your own body, without you noticin g. But there is a rival theory. Perhaps all of this dark matter is ordinary atomi c stuff, the same sort of stuff that stars and planets, and ourselves, are made of. At least as far as our own Galaxy is concerned, the dark material in the halo could be in the form of lar ge planets (\"jupiters\") or small, faint stars (\"brown dwarfs\"). Such obj ects would be much more massive, individually, than a single WIMP, but quite compact in astron omical terms. And they live in the halo. What else could they be called but Massive Astrophys ical Compact Halo Objects, or MACHOs? The great thing about MACHOs is that it ought to be possible to detect them -- not directly, but by their gravitational influence on light from even more distant obje cts. This depends on the way any gravitating mass bends light that passes near it, a key prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Einstein's prediction was conf irmed by studies of light from distant stars passing near the Sun, carried out during an ecli pse in 1919. Einstein himself pointed out, back in the 1930s, that under the right circ umstances a massive, dark object could focus light from a distant star, acting as a gravitati onal lens. And at the end of the 1980s astronomers realised that if a MACHO in the halo of o ur"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"Galaxy passed in front of a distant star while we were watching, we should see a flash of light caused by the gravitational lens effect. For a typical MACHO with a mass 1 per cent of that of our Sun, you would see one of these lensing events every 50,000 years or so. But modern astronomical techniques, us ing solid- state charge-coupled devices instead of photographic plates, make it possi ble to monitor millions of stars in the LMC, with computers analysing light variations in r eal time, so that as soon as a flash is detected other telescopes can be turned on the star of interest. Three teams of researchers have detected flashes of this kind, bearing all t he hallmarks of gravitational lensing caused by MACHOs. \"Flash\" is not quite the right word , because in each case the star being studied brightens up and then fades away over a coup le of weeks, as the putative MACHO moves slowly in front of it. This exactly matches the pr edictions, and details of the \"light curves\", as they are called, suggest that the halo i s full of MACHOs which each have a mass maybe 10 per cent of that of our Sun. If they account for all of the mass required to explain how the Galaxy rotates, t hat would mean a cool five thousand billion of these objects in the halo of our Galaxy alone, c ompared with just one or two hundred billion bright stars.We know how much deut erium (and other elements) there is in stars and galaxies because it leaves its characte ristic fingerprint in the form of lines in the spectrum of light from these objects. Very distant gal axies are seen as they were long ago, because light from them takes a long time (in this case, bill ions of years) to reach us. Using the deuterium abundances measured for stars i n our Galaxy, the Big Bang could have produced ten times more atomic matter than we see i n bright stars. But using the figures from the Keck observations, there is barely enou gh scope to make the stars themselves, and no room for MACHOs. The implication is clear -- any dark matter around must be in the form of WIM Ps, after all. Only, something is making the stars in the LMC flicker as we watch them, and nobody knows how WIMPs could be made to clump together to make the kind of massi ve, compact objects needed to do the gravitational lensing trick. Confused? So are the astr onomers; but they are also intrigued by the possibility that whatever is out there may be different from anything the theorists have yet been able to imagine. \"The universe is made mostly of dark matter and dark energy,\" says Saul Perlm utter, leader of the Supernova Cosmology Project headquartered at Berkeley Lab, \" and we don't know what either of them is.\" He credits University of Chicago cosmologist M ichael Turner with coining the phrase \"dark energy\" in an article they wrote toget her with Martin White of the University of Illinois for Physical Review Letters. Perlmutter and Neta Bahcall, Jeremiah Ostriker, and Paul Steinhardt of Pr inceton use the concept of dark energy in discussing their graphic approach to understandi ng the past, present, and future status of the universe. The Cosmic Triangle is the au thors' way of presenting the major questions cosmology must answer: \"How much matte r is in the universe? Is the expansion rate slowing down or speeding up? And, is the un iverse flat?\" The possible answers are values for three terms in an equation that desc ribes the evolution of the universe according to the general theory of relativity. By plotting the b est experimental observations and estimates within the triangle, scienti sts can make"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"preliminary choices among competing models. The mass density of the unive rse is estimated by deriving the ratio of visible light to mass in large systems su ch as clusters of galaxies, and in several other ways. For several decades the evidence has been building that mass density is low and that most of the matter in the universe is dark . Changes in expansion rate are estimated by comparing the redshifts of d istant galaxies with the apparent brightness of Type 1a supernovae found in them. These m easurements suggest that the expansion of the universe isaccelerating. Curvature is est imated from measurements of the anisotropy (temperature fluctuation) of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang. Although uncertainty is large, current results suggest a flat universe. The Cosmic Triangle eliminates some popular models, such as a high-densi ty universe that is slowing down and will eventually recollapse, as well as a nearly empty uni verse with no dark energy and low mass. While the evidence from galactic clusters shows that mass density is low, supernova evidence for acceleration shows that dark ener gy must be abundant. \"These two legs of the Cosmic Triangle agree with the evidence fr om the CMB that the universe is flat,\" Perlmutter says, adding that \"this is a remarkab le agreement for these early days of empirical cosmology.\" Thus the Cosmic Triangle suggests th at the standard inflationary scenario is on the right track: one of its key predicti ons is a flat universe. Various types of dark energy have been proposed, including a cosmic field associ ated with inflation; a different, low-energy field dubbed \"quintessence\" ; and the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy of empty space. Unlike Einstein's famous fudge f actor, the cosmological constant in its present incarnation doesn't delicately (and ar tificially) balance gravity in order to maintain a static universe; instead, it has \"negative press ure\" that causes expansion to accelerate. According to Discover, Mar 3, 2001, the universe that Newton and Einstein knew w as a tame, stable place. The Milky Way was the only galaxy in town, and its stars seemed f ixed in the firmament. The seeming stasis of the night sky had stumped New ton, and even a theory as powerful as relativity failed to explain it. So Einstein added an arbi trary term to his equations. Mathematically, it acted like a repulsive force spread sm oothly throughout the universe. Where gravity pulled, he said, this force pushed back in equ al measure. He called this fudge factor lambda, and eventually it came to be known as the cosm ological constant. Einstein never felt good about lambda, because he couldn't point to any theoret ical or experimental evidence for its existence. Later in life he called it hi s greatest blunder. For 50 years, Big Bang cosmology reigned. Then, three years ago, light from distant, dying stars revealed that the edges of space are rushing away from one another at an ever-i ncreasing rate. The cosmos, it seems, is not just growing but growing faster and faster. T he bigger the universe gets, the faster it grows. Some ubiquitous, repulsive force is dr iving at the margins of space, stomping on the accelerator. And there are no red lights in sight. Th at mysterious propulsion looks a lot like lambda."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Today's cosmologists are calling this force dark energy: \"dark\" because it may b e impossible to detect, and \"energy\" because it's not matter, which is th e only other option. Despite the sinister connotations, dark energy is a beacon that may lead phys icists to an elusive \"final theory\": the unification of all known forces, from thos e that hold the components of atoms together to the gravity that shapes space. Meanwhile th e notion of dark energy has helped reconcile a puzzling suite of recent observations about the shape and composition of the cosmos. In fact, the future of physics and the fate of the universe may ultimate ly depend on a kind of antigravity that has heretofore been a subject of mere conjecture. The e xperts think they know what role dark energy plays in the cosmos. Now all they have to do is figure out w hat dark energy is. The Boomerang data confirmed that the shape of the universe is f lat. That means the cosmos has just enough matter in it to keep photons traveling in str aight lines through space. If the universe had much more or far less matter disti nct patches in the microwave background (shown in blue and yellow) would appear either large r or smaller than in a flat universe. The answer finally came in the late 1990s, from giant telescopes studying the l ight of stars dying in spectacular explosions called supernovas. Supernovas are among the br ightest events in the cosmos, so they can be seen from very far away. Because light from t he most distant supernovas must travel for billions of years to reach our telescope s, astronomers can look to its redshift for a historical record of expansion reaching back bi llions of years. Expansion isn't slowing down as expected; it's speeding up. The find ing was counterintuitive, and it was based on brand-new methodology. But at the same t ime, a second group of space-telescope studies led by Brian Schmidt and Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics came to the same concl usion. Flat space isn't two-dimensional; it just isn't curved. Each shape corr esponds to a density of matter denoted by the symbol omega. To create a flat universe, matter must r each so- called critical density, which means omega equals one. In a saddle-shaped u niverse, omega is less than one; in a spherical universe, it's more than one. Astronome rs have sought to determine the value of omega and distinguish among these geometries by meas uring the way space bends beams of light. The light they like to measure isn't visib le; it's microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang that glows at the farthest reaches of the u niverse. Distortions in that microwave signal can reveal the shape of the intervening s pace. In a saddle-shaped universe, distinct patches of the microwave background w ould look smaller than they're predicted to be. A sphere-shaped universe would magnify t he patches of background radiation. In a flat universe, patches of background radiation woul d be closest to their predicted size. Recent studies of microwave background radiation had hinted that the un iverse is flat. Data from balloon-borne instruments lofted over Texas and Antarctica supp lied convincing evidence. Minute fluctuations in the radiation were the expected si ze. The most precise measurements available revealed that the shape of the universe is flat; i t has the critical density and omega equals one. There's not nearly enough stuff to account for the f latness astronomers observe. Unlikely as it seems, says Turner, the universe see ms to be made up mostly of empty space— a vacuum. \"And that finding,\" says University of Texas physic ist Steven Weinberg, \"could be regarded as the most fundamental discovery of ast ronomy.\""},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"As quantum mechanics matured through the middle of the last cent ury, it began to make sense, in a wonky way, that the apparent vacuum might have some energy in it. The orists had even named the hypothetical vacuum energy lambda, in honor of Einstein' s goof. And they'd realized long ago that if energy in the vacuum exists, it has a repulsive ef fect— one that could cause a universe to accelerate. But if some exotic form of repulsive energy does make up two thirds of all the stuff in the universe, it must be very weak . Otherwise its effects would have been obvious long ago. Whatever the mysterious lambda is, it must do its work only across great distances, on a cosmic scale. \"The discovery of an accele rating universe was simultaneously the biggest surprise and the most anticipat ed discovery in astronomy,\" he says. It put energy on the map. So the universe circa 2001 is flat, accelerating, and very nearly empty. And astron omers are happy, because a single entity with Einstein's imprimatur can explain all these attributes. But if the existence of dark energy has simplified researc hers' understanding of the contemporary cosmos, it has also introduced plenty of complications. One h as to do with the fate of the universe. In the days before dark energy, astronomers believed that the end of the expanding universe would be dictated by the density of matter i n it. Just as matter determined the curvature of space, it would also predict the way that space would expand and whether it would ever contract. Back when cosmic expansion was caused solely by the cataclysmic propulsion of the Big Bang, the gravity of matter was expected to eventually slow it down, maybe even stop it, maybe even reverse it. In shor t, density equaled destiny. In a flat universe, where the density of matter is exact ly one, the expansion eventually slows very nearly to a stop but never actually reverses. But if the universe is made up mostly of repulsive, ubiquitous energy rath er than matter, then its ultimate fate isn't inscribed in its shape after all. \"We us ed to say that fate and geometry were connected,\" says Turner. \"But that's only true if the stu ff of the universe is matter alone. Once dark energy comes in, then destiny and geometry decouple . So you can have a closed universe that expands forever and an open universe or a flat univer se that collapses.\" The only way to figure out the fate of the flat, empty, accelerating universe, s ays Turner, is to learn more about the dark energy that's impelling expansion. Theorists c an't explain why the densities of matter and energy are currently so close in value. Th eoretically, either of those densities could be anything from zero to infinity, and their rati o could vary accordingly. The odds of their being within an order of magnitude of each ot her are very low. The precarious balance between matter and energy that exists today in our universe— one-third matter to two-thirds energy— seems as improbable as the stat ic universe that Einstein struggled to describe. And some find that improbability espe cially suspicious, because a universe more dominated by dark energy would be inhospitable to li fe. The excess energy would prevent matter from clumping into galaxies, stars, and p lanets. Yet here we are. The fact that energy and matter have achieved a delicate balance is suspici ous, he says, only if you assume there's no communication between the two. Steinhardt has proposed that repulsive energy senses the presence of matter and changes its s trength or distribution to maintain a balance of densities. This energy could alter its properties over space and"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"across time; unlike lambda, it wouldn't be distributed evenly, and it wouldn't remain constant. Reckoning with dark energy will also spur attempts to define a quantum t heory of gravity. Gravity is the only one of the four known forces that has eluded descript ion in terms of energy bundles called quanta. Physicists have already managed to bring the other three— the strong force, the electromagnetic force, and the weak force— into the q uantum fold. But unlike those three forces, gravity typically operates on vastly different scales than quantum mechanics. \"Gravitation governs the motions of planets and stars ,\" Weinberg wrote in a recent review, \"but it is too weak to matter much in atoms, w hile quantum mechanics, though essential in understanding the behavior of electrons i n atoms, has negligible effects on the motions of stars or planets.\" With the discovery of dark energy, the two worlds collide. In the acceleration of the universe may lie some clues to the behavior of tiny quanta of gravitational ener gy. Einstein's own theories of gravity allow it to have some sort of repulsive effect, so elucidating the nature of dark energy could hasten theorists on their way to a f inal theory unifying all the forces. That's why physicists scanning the furthest r eaches of space with powerful telescopes suddenly seem very interesting to the physicis ts scribbling on the blackboards. But there's no guarantee that dark energy will serve up the ete rnal verities the high priests are hoping for. The unlikely balance of energy and matter and the strength of the vacuum energy may permit human existence through caprice, not neces sity. Einstein himself knew well the hazards of counting on capricious nature. \"Marriage ,\" he once opined, \"is the unsuccessful attempt to make something lasting out of a n accident.\" Scientists who would seek permanent truths in the accelerating un iverse could be making the same mistake. (2001 The Walt Disney Company). Poseidon also inhabits the turbulent flow of chaotic motion. His is th e underlying pattern governing the principles of complex dynamics. Though it appears random, thi s non-linear flow is actually patterned, though not in any precisely predictable man ner. Poseidon is the mighty spirit of waves whether they are in water or travel through the land as an earthquake. In fact, if we read \"matter\" in place of \"earth,\" we come to unde rstand that wave phenomena occur throughout nature from the atomic to cosmic realms. Q uantum physics uses the formula known as the Schroedinger wave equation to measu re this phenomenon of wave propagation. Time evolution is another form of wave--a \"time wave.\" Waves are found, not only in the great oceans, but in all sizable bodies of liqui d, as well as surface waves such as those found travelling through fields of grasses. A wave i s a nonmaterial essence which shapes the matter through which it passes . Objectively, a wave may be considered as pure energy in motion, expressing an ethereal \"might\" patterning the physical universe. The primary characteristics of waves include (1) ampl itude, or height from trough to crest; (2) length or distance between one crest and the n ext along the line of motion; and (3) frequency, which means the number of waves passing through a gi ven point during a specified amount of time. Frequency multiplied by len gth gives the speed of the wave. There are certain dimensional constants which occur in ocean waves in r egard to wind and the depth of the ocean floor. Like the mystic waters, the oceans are so deep and varied."},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"Differing conditions produce different types of waves. Poseidon is some times turbulent, sometimes serene. For example, rough winds produce choppy trochoidal wave s, while calmer seas consist of gentle sinusoidal waves. A wave's velocity is direct ly proportional to its period, and its length varies as the square of either. The nautical spee d of waves is calculated in knots and is equal to three times its period in seconds. I ts length in feet is 5 1/8 times the square of the period. Tsunamis (sometimes erroneously termed tidal waves) are directly rela table to Poseidon in that they are the result of earthquakes, radical shifting in the earth 's crust. While they are fairly harmless swells deep at sea, when they approach land they create enorm ous waves which wreak havoc in seaside areas. Other, less chaotic, types of waves may be foun d at river estuaries where fresh water meets the sea. This creates edd ies and underwater undulations. Snowdrifts and sand dunes may also be classified as waves which form u nder their own laws. Deep in the earth, magma moves in oscillatory wave patterns. Other wave phe nomena includes ripples and swells of radiations, gravitation, and electromagneti c waves in a plasma. On the microcosmic level, atoms are composed of durable waves ( standing waves) of resonance which structure matter. Waves are also the vibrational basis of music and sound in general. The impact of these airborne waves on our ear sallows us to hear . They reverberate on the spiral cochlea of our inner ears. It becomes easier to see why Poseidon is a power equal to Zeus, but with a slightly different dominion. Matter expresses the properties of both particles and waves. Eac h quantum of energy is a discrete segment of vibration bounded by nodes. Electrons cir cling their nucleus travel in quantized crests and troughs. These vibrations produce characte ristic wave patterns for the various elements. Electrons are considered as moving in an orbital, rather than an orbit. Its path is fuzzy or uncertain, rather than a well-defined line of motion. The entire radiat ion spectrum, from atoms to the unknown waves of pulsing stars and gyrating galaxies deep in the oce anic abyss of space may thus be seen as the physical embodiment of Poseidon. Poseidon may also express in more tangible forms such as the \"frozen\" spiral waves which constitute the curves of life. He may be seen in whorls, eddies, and heli xes. An example is the logarithmic, or equiangular spiral form of the shell of the sea creature , nautilus. These logarithmic spirals pervade many life forms, and are the visible form of expans ion of energy and growth. Like the seismic waves in the earth's crust, life is ne ver still, but functions as a dynamic equilibrium.

The shadow e mbodies the primitive, dark background from which we all emerge. That darkness r epresents the descent into darkness on the path of individuation; the unknown of our own deep subconscious mind. Elan vitale gets pulled into the unconscious leaving the ego frustrated, discontent, and isolated. The inner critic or judge takes over. Through projection, introversion and depression, the Self appears on your inn er stage as the shadow and confronts you with your inferior traits, those that prevent r ealizing unique potential and personal fulfillment. Cowardice, narcissism, laziness , ambivalence, rashness, dishonesty, envy, greed, lust, vanity and attachment and other self-indulgent t endencies have to be faced directly. If the shadow has not positive means of self-expre ssion, it may be acted out in self-defeating or self-destructive behaviors. Poseidon is traditionally linked to the sea. Many of us have a very, deep unexplain able love of the sea. Throughout civilization we have gone down to the sea in ships. The lore of the sea and the romance of sailing is well represented in literature and p oetry. In one sense this is not hard to understand, since we recall subconsciously that the ocean is the origin of life, and the \"waters of life\" still sustain and nourish us. The great sea per tains to our inner life, and we must remember that the bulk of the human body is water. Oceans formed 4400-4100 million years ago. The oldest fossil remains we have found are about 3500 million years old. The biochemical origins of life began from a primeval soup composed of water, methane, nitrogen, traces of ammonia, and small amounts of hydroge n. The primordial ooze was suffused with electrical discharges, or lightn ing, sparked into life by the Zeus principle. Zeus initiates the chain reactions which even tually lead to complex organic molecules. The nucleic material of DNA developed linear chain gr owth with the help of normal clay with traces of metals or silicates, acting as catalysts (re member Hephaistos?). The first phase of life on earth consisted of organelles or prokaryotes, whi ch lived by photosynthesis. We know them more commonly as blue-green algae, or cynanobact eria. They can exist in varied liquid environments from frigid lakes to hot sprin gs, and geysers. Later unicellular life forms developed, and cell division began, permi tting higher forms to emerge. Cells capable of mitosis, or cell division, are known as eukaryotes and require free atmospheric oxygen. Originally, primordial cells required no oxygen and were sustained by the f ree flow of the nutrient liquid around them. Their food was brought into proximity, and thei r waste"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"washed away. As cells clustered together more densely, higher forms of life evolved, requiring simple circulatory systems to achieve the task the ocean once fulfilled. Over time animals developed an \"internal ocean\" which gave them enhanced m obility, especially enabling them to move onto land. Today humans retain their link to t he primeval sea in the blood stream, whose salinity is approximately equivalent to that of se a water. These evolutionary memories still lie deep within our consciousness . This primal Poseidon- consciousness emerges spontaneously when we experience evolution ary regression in consciousness journeys. This was one of the characteristic earmarks of the oceanic aspects of L.S.D. journeys in the therapeutic setting. The journeyer follows the evol utionary wave backward and \"downward\" to the primordial ooze--to amoeba consciousness , and perhaps beyond. This state may also be experienced without drugs through the help of a \"cons ciousness guide.\" It is non-linear consciousness, which may feel chaotic at times , serene at others. It includes empty voids, great abysses which may be full of unrecognizable i nformation which is infused into the journeyer. Sometimes we may feel like we are drow ning in so much imagery. It contains currents and reefs and the best way to explore it is to sim ply \"flow with it.\" These dimensions can be hazardous, therefore a guide is essen tial. Primitive technology made it possible for primal mankind to return to th e sea, this time in ships. Later came the concepts of navies and the merchant marine, along wi th the science of navigation. Throughout history, the most advanced nations have navigated the mos t. Therefore, shipbuilding may be seen as an abridgement or compendium of a n ation's industrial arts. Exposure to new cultures through world travel provides an increase in awaren ess, and another perspective on one's own culture. It is an expanding awareness in w hich we can immerse ourselves by \"going native.\" We've sailed the Seven Seas, and now we sail the heavens. Oceanfarers are still symbolically initiated by Poseidon when they cross the International Dateline.They are swabed with a bucket of blood or paint. Th e captain portrays Neptune. Efficiency, or performance per pound is an old shipbuilder's conce pt. Ocean-going vessels were the original \"spaceships\" providing an independent, mobile lif e-support system in a hostile environment. Even today, ships are concentration points for our most c urrent technologies. Such common conveniences as heating, air conditioning, refrige ration, and electric lights were first used at sea. On the ocean, whole communities are sustained by mechanization. Prior to radio all naval captains were given absolute authority over their territ ories. They were trained in very broad-based programs to be comprehensivists. These sea warriors still retain the respect of their crew, even though their autonomy has been cir cumscribed by better communications systems. Even for landlubbers, the ocean is the touchstone for measurement. Even though sea-level is a mathematical average and pulsates twice daily with tides and moment to m oment waves, it is used to determine elevation. The earth fluctuates also, heaving an d sighing."},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"Perhaps soon the ancient connection between Poseidon's sea and his sacre d animal, the horse, will be reactivated.

INTELLECTUAL IDEA Poseidon and his wave phenomena are also present in the human brain, as brainw aves. If Zeus is seen as the Reticular Activating System, with its act of \"lighti ng up,\" and Poseidon is considered as older than, or prior to Zeus, he might well be considered as these primary pulsing undulations in the mind. The pattern of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortical section of the b rain can be recorded electrically. This is done by measuring the electrical pote ntial difference between two points on the scalp. This EEG record shows how brainwaves manifest as oscillating voltage. Their two dimensions include frequency of oscillation and ampli tude. The frequency predominantly determines the amplitude of the brain wave s, but there can be fluctuations of amplitude at a given frequency. Brain waves are broken up int o four main categories, determined by the frequency of the wave, and associated with d ifferent mental states. BETA: This is the brain wave of ordinary consciousness. It is characteriz ed as the state of being awake, alert, and concentrating. If this state is maintained for a prolon ged period, it becomes associated with feelings of tension, worry, fear, or anxiety. Lower brain states are necessary on an occasional basis to maintain the alert aspect of this state. A vis ual- identification in one's mind's eye occurs; a state where images are identified with form and specific objects. ALPHA: This is also a conscious state, but identified with the mental experience where images aren't identified. It has come to be associated with feelings of pleasure, pleasantness, tranquility, serenity, and relaxation. It can also imply a relaxed concentration, or l ight meditative state. It is also a place of visualization, creativity, light sleep and dream states. THETA: Traditionally labeled unconscious by Western medicine, th is state can be entered with awareness. Those trained in yoga, autogenics, or biofeedback can achieve th is state and retain consciousness. Theta has come to be associated with memory, drea ms, imagery, imagination, and healing states. These brainwaves are present during hypnogogic i magery, daydreaming, sleep, cognition of problem solving, future planning, switchin g thoughts, remembering, and creativity."},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"DELTA: Predominately associated with non-dreaming sleep or deep sle ep. There are some reports of individuals entering this brain wave pattern and still retai ning consciousness. If it is achieved while maintaining a conscious state, \"out-of-body\" (OOBE) e xperiences are subjectively experienced and reported. GAMMA: A state of hyperarousal which is very destructive to the brain if maintained for any period of time. The brain is operating too fast and overloads or \"burns out.\" The psychological concept associated in Jungian psychology with Poseidon is th e archetype of the shadow. His realm is the mixture of light and dark qualities. Shadow s are created in painting by mixing a color with its opposite. This tones down the hue of a color to a s hade of gray. Every painter knows that you cannot even create the illusion of depth without the shadow-aspects to round-out the form. Values of the gray scale are determin ed by the admixture of shadow and light. A darker value, by nature, contains more shadow. The shadow archetype includes those qualities of the individual whi ch have been rejected, repressed into the depths of the subconscious, or unlived. In short, it represents the inferior side of life with its own agenda. Even though it is autonomous, it is generall y judged negative from the ego's point of view. Yet, it gives us our depth, and is a use ful soul-guide in consciousness journeys. As a rule of thumb, the stronger the persona (social mask), the more repres sed the shadow side. It is forced to conform to collective expectations, norms, and values. Thi s can be especially true in religious people who identify only with the \"good\" qual ities of brightness and light. This creates a one-sided imbalance, and brings the shadow ou t in unconscious rebellion to compensate the stress created by the repression. Even in physics, the brighter the light, the deeper the shadows which a re cast. Jung even explored the premise that there is a shadowy aspect to the subconscious of God in ANSWER TO JOB. Job wrestled with an angel, much like we wrestle with our values and issues today. He wondered about the suffering inherent in the human cond ition. When the shadow and instinctual life aren't differentiated, they for m a contaminated state of consciousness which conditions the holder of this fantasy to experie nce \"devilish\" forms. This shapeshifter is considered the strongly polarized opposite of \"ab solute good\"--thus we see the devil holding Poseidon's trident in popular imagery. A conscious realization of the shadow produces an inner reconciliation wh ich might open the door to manifestation of some of the unlived potential for good. We gain release f rom our illusory role as \"innocent victim\" which causes us to project the vict imizer role onto others. By accepting our own inner tendencies to violent upheavals we reintegrate that portion of ourselves symbolized by Poseidon, ceasing to impose it on others in our environ ment. Projecting the shadow is a defense mechanism--a denial--which pre vents us from seeing our own weaknesses. We must continue to search for evidence of this dark force, and confront the shadow again and again. We are never \"rid\" of it, once and for all. Our instinctual side is a natu ral part"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"of our being. Every human is capable of any act when compelled by necessity, sur vival, or other factors. But we needn't live them out, by unconsciously \"acting out \", polluting the general environment with our personal darkness. We can come to know the shad ow through dreams and self-analysis, through our angers, delights, and projecti ons of enmity. The shadow contains bright and good qualities also. These are our deeply hid den, unlived virtues--our potential. They may not be evident in our habitual behavior, whi ch may be socially programmed, but often rise to the surface in a crisis situation. We can recognize these qualities, because we tend to envy them in other people. An integrated individual transforms through imaginative insights. This i s another expression of Poseidon energy. By turning thoughts inward, and withdrawing pr ojections from others, we release those around us from contamination with our prec onceived notions. Further readings on Poseidon may be found in, \"Poseidon: Darkening of the Light,\" a tape by Philip Zabriskie THE ODYSSEY by Homer ZEUS AND HERA by C. Kerenyi JUNG AND TAROT by Sallie Nichols SPIRITUAL MYTH A curious point regarding Poseidon (or Neptune) compared to other planetar y powers, is that his character bears little resemblance to those assigned Neptun e by modern astrologers. Neptune in astrology has little resemblance to the sea-god, per haps because Neptune wasn't even known to ancient Chaldean astrologers. In any event, Neptune is ascribed a sense of sacrifice and detachment, and this links it to THE HANGED MAN of Tarot. Through meditation we learn that the soul is a drop from the Ocean of Consciousness. In other words, the separate ego is not the ulti mate truth, and must merge back into Godhead as a bubble merges in the ocean. THE HANGED M AN symbolizes the descent of Light into darkness to redeem it. In the personality, this Spirit of the Mighty Waters, creates a reversal of thought in terms of values and priorities. What formerly seemed important becomes less so, and what was ignored comes to the fore. There is a redemption of and through the \"subme rged\" element. The highest arc of Poseidon-personality transmutes from generative powe r through earthly authority (credibility, empowerment) into personal transmutation. The material or instinctual nature no longer dominates the soul. The transformative formula of Poseidon is based on the sacrifice of one form for another. Self-sacrifice (of the small self) leads to cosmic consciousness, ju st as selfless service to humanity leads to personality development. Sacrifice is a virtually inevitab le part of life. In EGO AND ARCHETYPE, Edward Edinger describes four basic types of sac rifice which are possible:"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"1. \"God sacrifices Man\": This indicates that the ego is inflated or too full o f its own importance, and the divine realm of the archetypes is perceived as empty or void. Only that which is empty may be filled. The balance must be shifted from ego to the values of the higher Self. 2. \"God sacrifices God\": This formula is symbolized by the Mass or eucharist . When the ego is vacuous, or devoid of spirit, it needs a nourishing influx of moisture and substance from the divine forces of the collective unconscious. It needs to absorb n ourishment from the revivifying powers of the subconscious. 3. \"Man sacrifices God\": When our ego devalues the divine forces which comes to us through the subconscious, we are attempting to steal the fire of the gods for our personal use in conscious life. This is like trying to fulfill mundane desire s through magic, and it provokes a reactionary attack from the subconscious. 4. \"Man sacrifices Man\": The principle here is of personal transformati on and transcendence through surrender and meditation. It is not motivated by c ompulsion or competition with the subconscious, but by the principle of loving coop eration. The eucharist becomes our own selves in a process of self-assimilation or fe edback. We circulate personal and divine energies throughout ourselves. In alchemy this is a proc ess called circulatio, or circulation of the light. This indicates merging the sacr ificedego-personality with the ocean of divine Bliss, yielding a sense of immortality. Elemental water or \"the W ater of Life\" is a spiritual metaphor of great power and potency. But it is more than a metaphor--it is a living reality. The sea of life or p rimal water is the womb of life. The oriental notion of the Tao is tied to the archetyp al nature of water--yielding, flowing, seeking the path of least resistance, doing by n ot-doing. It is the state of no-form or total, chaotic dissolution from which all form is created or born. When we dive deep in that vast abyss within, we lose the separate personal se lf and find the deep Eternal Self. Meditation is the prescribed method of gaining thi s form of consciousness. When sensory awareness is suspended, the sages note that, \"M uddy water let stand becomes clear.\" CULTURAL COUNTERPARTS SHIVA (Hindu) NEPTUNE (Roman) EA (Babylonian) AEGIR (Norse sea-god) TARINGA-NUI (Oceania sea-god) OLOKUN (West African sea-god) CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLES The obvious fictional character much like Poseidon is Captain Nemo of the Jules Verne classic 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.

DIALOGUE WITH POSEIDON The list of negative characteristics assigned to Poseidon reads like a li tany of shadow-traits. Since he governs the entire depths of the unconscious realm, there is al ways the possibility that these forces will erupt from below at any moment. Those subterranean rumblings in our bodies and shaking sensations are the visceral experience of Poseidon--direct experience of this primal force. Th ey signify messages from the unconscious which supercede our normal consciousness or \"head t rip.\" This is one aspect of THE HANGED MAN who is suspended upside-down. R ather than \"getting rid of\" these symptoms, we can get into them, deeper and deeper b y exploring them through consciousness journeys within the psyche.

He helps us defend ours elves, insisting on our right to cater to our own needs. Generosity and big-heartedness can also c ome through this archetype.

CHAPTER XIII: DEATH & REBIRTH THANATOS "},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"Contemplation of death conjures up images of disintegration, dismemberm ent, flying apart. In consciousness journeys, the dreamer may be sucked through a swi rling vortex into a profound blackness--black that is blacker than black--cold and ut terly empty. This state of nothingness feels different to individuals, depending on th eir personal experience with various aspects of death. Thanatos-consciousness may be an encounter with an apocalyptic whirlwind which rends one limb-from-limb, then fragments the sense of self even furth er down to cellular, genetic, and atomic consciousness. The imagery of apocalypse and natural disaster surf aces as the ego glimpses its immanent doom. The dance of Death is a whirlwind of transfor mation. Ego-death is a requirement for opening to the broader realm of transpersonal r eality. It heralds a change in the form of consciousness. The crux of this consciousness process is reaching the creative state of undifferentiated consciousness. It is in this state that old primal self images dissolve, an d from it the new ones form. It is a death because at the deepest levels we define ourselve s by this image and what it has created and frozen into our lives. It ultimately means the dism emberment of our former personality and life patterns. We are it and it is our death when it dissolves into the infinite possibilities of chaotic consciousness. This unformed consciousness--which we often mistake for death-- is really the essence of our vitality and life f orce. It is the energy we can use to recreate ourselves in every instant of time. It reaches our aw areness through dreams (Hypnos) and the flow of our imagination. Yielding to ego-death leads to this consciousness, whether it comes thr ough therapy or a spontaneous near-death experience (N.D.E.) or a closely witnessing de ath. This consciousness can result from a brush with one's own death or that of anoth er. Dissolving is a death that opens into a field of unformed consciousness with infi nite creative possibilities. But we must go through the fear and pain which surround s this experience to reach this consciousness state. There may be sensations of falling, or floating-falling, or flying off in all di rections at once. Eventually all parts of the self are dismembered by the centrifugal for ces experienced in the vortex. With a sweep of His scythe, the unseen specter of death cuts us d own utterly. Sensations of spinning and being drawn deeper create intense diz ziness and disorientation, even nausea. Dismemberment in the spiral often leads to a sense of being \"n o-thing.\" The experience of another's natural death is awesome, as is that of birth. Be ing there, one finds that at that amazing moment there is a giant dilation in the flow of t ime; a window opens into that other vast realm which is slow to close. It may capture part of oneself for a time, creating a mini-death, or death-in-life. The changes which ensue may be voluntary or involuntary. It may trigger a regression as well as a profound opening to transpers onal awareness. Particularly when a parent or child of ours dies, we are permane ntly changed in ways we may never have imagined. Some of them have to do with what we imagine or believe the nature of death and an afterlife to be. In myth, Thanatos or Death, naturally supplied Hades with his subjects. Th anatos is the son of Night, who in turn was born from Chaos. The godform of Thanatos is pictur ed alternatively as dressed in a black robe holding the fatal sword, or as a winged s pirit,"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"resembling his twin brother Hypnos, or Sleep. Hypnos also lives in the un derworld. He induces the little death of sleep with his magic wand or by fanning his dark wings. In eastern mysticism, death is personified in feminine form as the d readed and dreadful goddess Kali. Her cult was portrayed in the blockbuster movie INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM . Graveyards or cemeteries are the haunts of this bloodthirsty goddess. Her image is built of a myriad of skulls and bones. Tantric Buddhis ts contemplate her, and their own personal demise, by visualizations of rotting corpses, or me ditating in graveyards where the remains are strewn about. They seek liberation of their human souls through immortality. Shiva, the Destroyer, consort of Kali Ma is the masculine form of this force. S hiva is the prince of demons, who brings pestilence and death. Paradoxically, he is also t he slayer of demons. He is the dissolver of outworn forms--destroyer of all things. Shiva's dance is a process of universal creation and destruction, a symbol of the reconciliati on of opposites. This powerful unbridled erratic force also carries archetypal healin g capacity within its pattern. This archetypal drive was the theme of Gore Vidal's KALKI. In our modern society, questions of life and death create issues such as moral positions on suicide, abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment. These questions b ear directly ont who we are and shall be. Mankind is also wiping our entire species fro m the face of the earth daily. The Biblical injunction \"Thou shalt not kill,\" has been m isinterpreted as \"Thou shalt not murder thy fellow human beings,\" while the pointless slaughter of animals for exploitation continues. Spiritual teachers tell us that all life is s acred. As an archetype, Thanatos represents a fundamental soul-quality present in the psyche. From this perspective all life aims toward natural transformation and recycling through the process of death. The soul gains knowledge of itself, not only through love, in tellect, and madness, but also by reflection on the great unknowable which lies past the gates of death. The sorcerer's apprentice Carlos Casteneda was cautioned to keep death as his constant companion, always referring any powerful decisions to this touchstone of me aning. How differently we might act if we reflected on our actions in light of the constant possibility of immanent death. Psychologist Sigmund Freud spent as much of his career reflecting on de ath and the physical pathology of the body as he did obsessing on sexual motivation. He not only contemplated it in his patients' behaviors and fantasies, but in his ow n as well. He was phobic about cancer, which he later contracted in the mouth and jaws from years of smoking. As the father of depth psychology which focuses on the symbolic u nderworld, he introduced us to the world of Thanatos and Hades. Freud pointed out that \"pathologizing\" is a metaphorical language of the psyche, al lowing it to deliteralize the events of our daily life. Psychopathologies had be en considered trivial, but Freud showed that they contained a previously invisible depth of me aning. The nature of that meaning revealed the profound relationship of death to life. Dreams , symptoms, and afflictions became the inroads into the dark realm of the subconscious."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"Freud resurrected the intimate symbolic connection between soul and death for Westerners. Eastern religions had never lost this connection. He showed how the perspectives of Hades and Thanatos dissolve the organic, social, and emotional aspects of human life. Fantasies of putrefaction, decay, sickness, compulsion, and sui cidal impulses disclose this psychological perspective which seeks deepening. Freu d ended his own life enraptured or fascinated with this train of thought. In Tarot, the Death card means being stuck in old patterns, needing to elim inate restrictive habits, beliefs, blocks and outworn ways. This painful uprooted may involve eliminating people or things from your past. The uprooting of habits is surgically cutting you rself free for entrance, assimilation and integration into a new state. It is liberation an d renewal which makes new growth possible. Deep emotions can be like a \"little de ath\", as in intense sexual experience. Giving up one's sense of self means merging with anot her or Cosmos, cutting through superficialities, butting to the bone. Our energy is radi cally transformed from one shape or form to another. PHYSICAL FORM The food-chain extends beyond the notion of \"Nature red-in-tooth-and-cl aw\" to the cosmic and intergalactic levels. As in the sea, the 'little fish' are eaten by t he 'bigger fish,' and Death awaits all forms in their own time-scale. By 1998, astrophysicists were fairly confident they had detected a massive blac k hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, and they dubbed it the Great Annihilator. Black hol es are massive stellar objects whose gravitational fields cause the space and ti me around them to fold in upon itself—creating a so-called singularity from which nothing, n ot even light, can escape. Fountains of ejected antimatter were detected by 2001, and despite competing theories, such as gravastars, black holes are now widely presumed to lie conce aled in the hearts of most, if not all galaxies. The galactic core is viewed from Earth through th e constellation Sagittarius, and the Annihilator is known as Sgr A Star. Something hugely massive is at the center of the Milky Way, acting like a galactic puppeteer by providing the tremendous gravity needed to tug at stars with i nvisible strings. If it is in fact a black hole, then it must meet the technical defi nition laid out by Einstein's general theory of relativity: All its mass must be locked and hidden in side a sphere known as an event horizon, beyond which nothing -- not even light -- can escape. Just b efore the matter swirls into a black hole, scientists predict it will approach the speed of light and become superheated, giving off X-rays prior to entering the event horizon. The Annihilator, a gravitational monster, has the mass of 2.6 million suns, and is sm aller than an atom. The temperatures in its vicinity top 10 billion degrees. It cre ates vast luminosities in its area, accelerating matter to .5 the speed of light. But once that matter crosses the black hole's \"event horizon,\" not even light can escape the viol ent gravitational well. Tidal force creates a whirlpool, a giant accretion disk of \"snacks\" to fee d the hungy gaping maw -- sending the \"hole food\" into the veritable jaws of Death. Magnetic fiel ds ripple through the large clouds of dust. Antimatter shoots up from the core straigh t out of the"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"disk for around 5,000 light years, then annihilates with ordinary matter in gargant uan bursts of energy. It sucks in matter and belches radiation. Depending on the rate of matter flow, the massive pressures also create a nur sery for new stars, which is more or less active at various points in our galactic evolution. Th ere are what are called \"Seyfert\" and cosmic jewel \"starburst phases\" in that cyclic process. The black hole provides star-forming shocks which compress surrounding gas and dust clouds to the point of star formation. In Morris' theory, the galactic core goes through Seyfert, starburst and quiescent periods, which might mythopoetically be rela ted to the cosmic cycles known as Days and Nights of Brahm. The Milky Way is now fairly quiescent . The Annihilator is 24,000 light-years from Earth. But astronomers had not been abl e to rule out another possibility, a dense cluster of dark stars. Then, in 1999, NASA launched the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Chandra is a telescope that orbits the earth i n space. Instead of seeing light like our eyes do, Chandra sees X-rays. The astronomer s knew that as stars fall into black holes, they give off X-rays as they're being ripped apart. T he hapless matter, before plunging into the abyss, becomes super dense and hot, rele asing intense X- ray emissions. So if they looked at the Milky Way's center with Chandra, and saw the right kin d of X- rays, they could feel sure there was a black hole. By September, 2001, direct obser vations offered the first authoritative evidence that a black hole resides in t he heart of our galaxy, The Chandra detected an X-ray flare leap from the center of the Milky Way, pr esenting almost conclusive proof of the scientific oddity. Large flares periodically erupt from the black hole as chunks of matter f all into it. The intense burst, heralding the fatal plunge of matter into oblivion, allowed astronomers to estimate the size of the black hole lurking in the central Milky Way at n o larger than the distance between the sun and Earth. But astronomers had not been able to ru le out another possibility, a dense cluster of dark stars. The Milky Way's black hole has be en described as the 'Holy Grail' of astrophysics. Its edge, the event horizon, \"separates our Universe from another world\", says Melia. \"Some say that when you cross the event horizon, time becomes space and space becomes time.\" The Great Attractor is another cosmic structure, drawing or apparently d evouring matter. During the 1980s, a group of astronomers, dubbed the \"Seven Samurai,\" examined the se peculiar velocities and determined that a \"Great Attractor\" is pulli ng on every galaxy within a region of space 300 million light-years across. The Great Attractor is believed to be located in the direction of the constellation Virgo. The local galaxies, inc luding the Milky Way, appear to be rushing toward it at approximately 700 kilometers per second. On the opposite side of the Great Attractor, the Samurai have identified sever al galaxies moving toward us, which indicates that the source of the gravitational pull is a r elatively small, supermassive object. In the 1980's, astronomers Alan Dressler, Sandra Faber, David Burstein and Gary Wegn er had investigated thee motions of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, the Local Group (w hich contains the Milky Way), and the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster, and discove red that these vast collections of thousands of galaxies were also being tugged, gravitationally, by wh at"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"appeared to be an even larger collection of matter. This collection of matter, wh ich they estimated was located 3 times farther away than the Virgo cluster (which i s 77 million light years distant) in the direction of the constellation Centaurus, was dub bed the Great Attractor. The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are the dominant structures in a galaxy cluste r called the Local Group which is, in turn, an outlying member of the Virgo s upercluster. Andromeda--about 2.2 million light-years from the Milky Way--is speeding towar d our galaxy at 200,000 miles per hour. This motion can only be accounted for by gravitational attraction, even though the mass that we can observe is not nearly great enough to exe rt that kind of pull. The only thing that could explain the movement of Andromed a is the gravitational pull of a lot of unseen mass--perhaps the equivalent of 10 Milky Way -size galaxies--lying between the two galaxies. The team of astronomers even found that galaxies located on the other side of t he Great Attractor were being pulled in by it. In other words, rather than these collections of galaxies expanding with the rest of the universe, they were being held bac k very slightly by the gravitational pull of the Great Attractor. Unfortunately, much of the p redicted mass in the Great Attractor is hidden behind the obscurring dust and gas in th e plane of our Milky Way, so it is very hard for astronomers to study this collection of objects direct ly; or to independently confirm that it is indeed there in the first place ! Somewhere behind the Milky Way disk, for example, are crucial parts of the t wo biggest structures in the nearby universe: the Perseus-Pisces superc luster of galaxies and the \"Great Attractor,\" a gargantuan agglomeration of matter whose existence has be en inferred from the motions of thousands of galaxies through space. Observat ions also show a tantalizing number of bright and nearby galaxies in the general direction of t he disk, suggesting there are many others that go unseen. Without knowing what lies in our blind spot, researchers cannot fully map the matter in our corner of the cosmos. This in turn prevents them from settling some of the most important questions in cosmology: How large are cosmic structures? How did th ey form? What is the total density of matter in the universe? The unseen mass inhabi ting the voids between the galaxies and clusters of galaxies amounts to perhaps 10 times more t han the visible matter. Even so, adding this invisible material to luminous matte r brings the average mass density of the universe still to within only10-30 percent of the critical density needed to \"close\" the universe. Might the universe be \"open\" after all? Cosmologists continue to debate th is question, just as they are also trying to figure out the nature of the missing mass, or \"dark matt er.\" and \"dark energy.\" A River of Galaxies, to rival that of the River Styx is flowing through interstellar space. This mass migration includes the Local Group, the Virgo Cluster, the Hydra -- Centaurus Supercluster, and other groups and clusters for a dis tance of at least 60 Mpc up and downstream from us. It is as if a great river of galaxies (includin g our own) is flowing with a swift current of 600 km/s toward Centaurus. Calculations indicate that ~1016 solar masses concentrated 65 Mpc away in the dire ction of Centaurus would account for this. This mass concentration has been dubb ed the Great"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"Attractor. Detailed investigation of that region of the sky (see adjacent image of the galaxy cluster Abell 3627) finds 10 times too little visible matter to account for this flow, again implying a dominant gravitational role for unseen or dark matter. Thus, the Great Attractor is certainly there (because we see its gravitational influe nce), but the major portion of the mass that must be there cannot be seen in our telescopes. Are these megastructures contemporary analogies of those from the Bible ? John describes the constellation Virgo and Hydra in Revelation 12:14 evidenced by the descrip tion he (John)used in the second half of the sign that he describes in the heave ns. Indeed the constellation Hydra, sometimes called \"Hydra the Serpent or the Dragon\" stands before the constellation in the early morning hours in Israel in the months of S eptember/October (see Job 26:13; Ps. 74:14; and Is. 27: 1). Here John also describes how a third of the stars of the heavens are drawn by the tail of the dragon and cast to the earth. [Job 26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed t he crooked serpent. Psa 74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be mea t to the people inhabiting the wilderness. Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall puni sh leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and h e shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.] Is this mythopoetic or just a meaningless bit of information or was John given s ome insight to the powers and design of the cosmos? In the July, 1993 issue of Astronomy Magazine there is an article entitled, \"Cosmic Tug of War\" by David Burstein and Pet er L. Manly. In the article, they describe this hidden force found in the constel lation Centarus. This \"Great Attractor\" of hidden dark matter is located in and at the very tail of \"Hyd ra the Serpent or the Dragon.\" But what is most interesting is how they describe just what this \"Great Attractor\" is attracting or drawing to it. \"Whereas galaxy clusters contain man y galaxies in a small region, the Great Attractor has its many galaxies spread over an enormou s volume of space. As we see it, over five thousand galaxies in the Great Attractor splay across 60 degrees of the sky, covering one-third of the southern hemisphere.\" This truth about the \"Great Attractor\" was not officially discovered and r eleased by scientists until 1987, but John describes this sign in the heavens the s ame way exactly 1900 years earlier (Rev. 12:1-4). \"Our local group of galaxies, which consist of our galaxy, Andromeda, and some 30 smaller galaxies is moving at about 630 km per second towards this Great Attractor.\" That is about 391.5 miles per second or about 23,488.25 miles pe r hour. We are being drawn toward the constellation Centarus at the tail of Hydra, which is also toward the southern Crux (The Cross). As the seven discoverers of thi s Great Attractor have concluded, \"we will not stop falling into Virgo Supercl uster and the enormous mass of the Great Attractor will increasingly draw us towards i t.\" As we get closer and closer to the Great Attractor, it will increase its pull up on the earth. The earth and the local group that it is part of, will be caught up in this celestial tug of war. The powers that are at work in our universe are absolutely awesome."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"The Great Attractor is about 200 million light-years away [see \"The Large-Scal e Streaming of Galaxies,\" by Alan Dressler; Scientific American , September 1987]. The Local Group seems to be caught in a cosmic tug of war between the Great Attractor and t he equally distant Perseus-Pisces supercluster, which is on the opposite si de of the sky. To know which will win the war, astronomers need to know the mass of the hidden parts of t hese structures. Both are components of a long chain of galaxies known as the Super galactic Plane. The formation of such a megastructure is thought to depend on the natu re of the invisible dark matter that makes up the bulk of the universe. Chains of galaxies should be more likely in a universe dominated by particles of so-called hot dark mat ter (such as massive neutrinos) rather than by cold dark matter (such as axions or other hyp othetical particles). But astronomers cannot distinguish between these two pos sibilities until they map the structures fully. The true richness and significance of this cluster has become clear in the recent searches. Kraan-Korteweg, with Patrick A. Woudt of the European Southern Observatories in Garching, Germany, has discovered another 600 galaxies in the cluster. The obser ved velocities of the galaxies suggest that the cluster is very massive indeed- -on par with the well-known Coma cluster, an agglomeration 10,000 times as massive as our galaxy. At long last, astronomers have seen the center of the Great Attractor. Along with s urrounding clusters, this discovery could fully explain the observed galaxy motions in the nearby universe. The Milky Way, too, has its prey: in 1994, when Rodrigo A. Ibata, then at the University of British Columbia, Gerard F. Gilmore of the University of Cambridge and M ichael J. Irwin of the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Cambridge, England, who were studyin g stars in our Milky Way, accidentally found a galaxy right on our doorstep. Named the Sagittarius dwarf, it is now the closest known galaxy--just 80,000 light-years away from the solar system, less than half the distance of the next closest, the Large Magellani c Cloud. In fact, it is located well inside our galaxy, on the far side of the galactic center. Because the Sagittarius dwarf lies directly behind the central bul ge of the Milky Way, it cannot be seen in direct images. Its serendipitous detection was base d on velocity measurements of stars: the researchers spotted a set of stars movin g differently from those in our galaxy. By pinpointing the stars with this velocity, looking for others at the same distance and compensating for the light of known foreground stars, they m apped out the dwarf. It extends at least degrees from end to end, making it the largest ap parent structure in the sky after the Milky Way itself. Its angular size corresponds to a diamet er of at least 28,000 light-years, about a fifth of the size of our galaxy, even though the dwarf is only a thousandth as massive. Though it rarely comes through participation in the food chain nowadays, at th e human scale, annihilation through natural or accidental death is the obvious physi cal expression of this Thanatos force. DEATH has often been avoided or glossed over by Tarot commentators, who would prefer to stick to the symbolic meaning rathe r than stark reality; and yet somehow our culture is obsessed with death. Our societ y is making strides towards overcoming the phobic or denial response through such infrastru ctures as the hospice movement. Death and Dying is not surrounded by such taboo as it once was. The fact is that death is a natural part of life, and contains its own beauty, meani ng, and vision."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"Symptoms associated with this archetype of being seized down into the u nderworld, not only include death, but also appear in coma and the sleep disorders of Narcol epsy and Catalepsy. In narcolepsy, a person falls profoundly asleep with no warning du ring any activity. It is characterized by specific brain patterns. Catalepsy lite rally means \"to seize down.\" Consciousness and feeling are suddenly and temporarily lost, whil e the muscles become rigid as in rigor mortis. There is no response to external stimuli , so in the past cataleptics were mistaken for dead and sometimes buried. Edgar Allen P oe used catalepsy as the theme in PREMATURE BURIAL , playing on the horrific primal fear of \"living death.\" In physics, Thanatos may be symbolized in the natural universe by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Entropy or Disorder. Briefly, thi s law describes how in the long-run there is certainty that order will give way to disorder in any closed system, macrocosmic or microcosmic. All earthly life involves organisms which function as closed systems, which are subject to the loss of order. Theref ore, physical death is inevitable. That which takes form, ultimately dissolves that form and d ies. In thermodynamics, entropy means that all energy seeks to become evenly dis tributed. It diffuses toward a neutral condition of \"heat death.\" In human and univers al terms, warmth means life. To retain the will to live as humans we resist diffusion, attempting to re main orderly, organized, stable, and solid. Spiritual practice and discipline is one me ans of increasing order, or tapping into the life-promoting forces of negentropy (see XI THEM IS). On more mundane levels we watch our diets to be sure we take in enough life-givi ng nutrient to sustain mental and emotional stability. Yet, despite our conscious efforts, the reaper comes closer each and e very day. There is a primal instinct within us which yearns for that final goal of life, that great moment when eternity yawns wide to receive us. Freud called it Thanatos, and contrasted it with life- promoting Eros. Freud noticed the \"longing\" and drivenness toward deat h, which appears as self-destructive tendencies and aggression toward others. This dest ructive urge is primal. Both Jung and Freud recognized the archetypal \"murderer and su icide in us.\" It surfaces in images of grisly, destructive acts. Thanatos functions within the cellular and genetic level. Every day thous ands of worn out cells die and are replaced through the process of tissue regeneration. Ou r entire body is replaced about every seven years. Another little \"death\" comes as sleep each night. Thanatos inhabits our dreams as well, with images of death, torture, muti lation, and rotting.

It marks the point at which choices and decisions must be made in order to move on, and it would be unusual to think of it as a place to stay, a place of permanent exi stence. There are, however, situations in the lives of people in which transitio ns from an old situation to a new one, one social position to another, are hampered or cannot be c ompleted successfully. Individuals who are caught in between two stages of developme nt, who do not hold clearly defined positions within their social system, feel margi nal, excluded, without identity nor influence. A number of anthropological studies (by Arnold van Gennep, Victor Turner and Mary Douglas) have provided insight into forms of threshold existence (liminali ty) in modern society and have accounted for the difficulties that individuals have to f ace in these positions. They have also shown, however, that individuals who are caught in suc h positions are usually provided with a clear view on the social structure from which they are excluded, and that they carry the potential for critique of the norms that p revail within that structure. The threshold symbolizes an in-between position. For individuals in in-between positions, as well as the conflicts that are caused by such positions, the literal mean ing of `threshold' hardly needs any specification: it is the sill of a doorway, as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it, which has to be crossed when entering a house. It indicates the point at which the public outside world ends and the private, familial inside world begin s. In more general terms it marks the place, line or border at which a passage can be made from one space to another. Such a spatial structure has an essential influence on social in teractions: relationships and social status are negotiated at the threshold, one is eith er rejected from or welcomed to the other side. To gain admission and step over the threshold i nto someone else's space means to submit to the rules that are in force in that plac e Social organisation decides whether we are included in or excluded from a social group, and pol itical or religious reasons or social rank can account for the identification of a pers on with a certain group and space As these examples show, the threshold can be interpreted as a symbol of d ivision, which determines social structure and our notion of `self' and `other'. As a li teral and figurative point of passage, however, the threshold also stands for change: one can step over the threshold, enter new territory and leave everything else behind. Such a c hange can be a shift in time, as in the expression `at the threshold of a new century'. I t can also designate a decisive moment in one's personal development (`on the threshold of w omanhood'), which means that one separates from a familiar situation and enters a new stage in li fe. In a religious context the threshold is a crucial element in initiation rit es, indicating the passage from the profane to the sacred. `Initiation,' furthermore, is a term that is not exclusively used in a religious context, but appears in all fields of social life, refe rring to a special ritual that opens the door, as it were, to a social group or new period in life. In a psychological context the threshold symbolises a point at which a decisi on must be made. Decision-making can be experienced as the overcoming of a difficult y or crisis, as the necessity to take a decisive step. The eventual change will provide the pr otagonist with new knowledge, he or she will undergo a development and be different from th e person that he or she was before the change."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"A famous example of such a change can be found in the Book of Genesis: because of their decision to eat from the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve are driven out of the Garden of Eden, which is both a territorial passage and a figurative transition as their status changes through their loss of innocence. This is the mythological threshold wher e mankind lost its immortality and entered the dominion of the Lord of Death, time and mortali ty. One is either \"in\" the paradisical garden, or \"out\" of the Garden. And it is guard ed by the Dweller on the Threshold whose sword will cut one down for trying to ente r without mystic cache. Decision-making is also an essential narrative element in fairy tales, whe re a vast number of princes or dragon killers or Bluebeard's wives have been standing in fr ont of gates, caves and locked doors and have been losing their nerves about a decision that would b ring either life or death, disaster or eternal happiness. It is interesti ng to note that decisions usually trigger off an irreversible process, which in many cases turns th e threshold into a point of no return. Last but not least one might also think of the magical component of the thre shold in superstitious beliefs. In some cultures the threshold is consi dered to be a dwelling place of ghosts and the souls of the dead, who lead an existence in between the worl d of the living and the world of the dead. This is probably one reason why in some cultures an d religions it is forbidden to step on it. In the majority of the examples above the thre shold represents a point or border that divides two different elements and at which a passage can be made from the one to the other, or which simply marks a change or development in ti me or status. That a passage or a change is in fact a much more complex process has been argue d by the anthropologist Arnold van Gennep (1873-1957), who investigated changes in the live s and statuses of people and the cultural or religious rites related to these c hanges. Van Gennep distinguishes between different sorts of changes in the life of a pe rson and classifies them as `separation' (such as death), `transition' (e.g. pregnancy) and `incorporation ' (e.g. marriage). Van Gennep points out that actually every change consists of thes e three forms, or phases: phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 separation \" src=\"st relica. gif\" width= 21 border =0 transition \" src=\"st relica. gif\" width= 21 border =0 incorporation (from an old situation) (passage) (into the new situation)."},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"To perceive death, for example, as a separation (from life) rather than an inc orporation (into an afterlife) clearly depends on the point of view that ascribes to on e phase more importance than to the other, and also on cultural and religious beliefs. Van Gennep shows a special interest in the transitional phase: it is th e period in which a person is in-between the former and the future social position or magico -religious state. In order to illustrate his point he refers to those early times in human his tory when countries did not border directly on each other but were divided by a neutral zone. I n this zone travellers found themselves in a special situation as neither laws of t he adjoining countries applied - they \"wavered between two worlds\", as it were (Gennep 18). Lik e this territorial passage, non-territorial transitions also consist of a moment or period of un certainty, a liminal period. Such a period is accompanied by, or equal to, a life-crisis. `C risis' in this context is an interesting choice of vocabulary and could easily be misinter preted. Van Gennep does not refer to the term in a strictly psychological sense. He u ses it to indicate the unstable social or magico-religious position of the person who undergoes a change: during the transition the state of that person remains uncertain as he or she has been separated from a clearly defined state in the past and has not been i ncorporated yet into a clearly defined future state. Such a state that evades definition is potentially dangerous, because it represents a moment or period in which the rou tines of life are disrupted. As one of the consequences, the person undergoing the change h as no guidelines anymore to hold on to, which might not only have a disturbing effect on that person bu t also on his or her surrounding. As the title of his work, The Rites of Passage , suggests, Van Gennep was not only interested in the changes in the lives of people but al so in the rituals that accompany these changes. These rituals have the function to give person al, social and cultural significance to a transition. They cushion the disturbances (s uch as a definition vacuum) that are caused by a change and help to incorporate the individu al into a new group and return him to the customary routines of life (Kimball, introdu ction ix). Van Gennep's theories were further elaborated by the anthropologist V ictor Turner. Turner, however, did not only focus on the investigation of ritual processes i n the lives of individuals but developed a more general theory of socio-cultural process es which he applied to changes and generative processes in modern societies. He pr imarily concentrated on the aspect of structure in Van Gennep's concept of passage. Parallel to Van Gennep's distinction between separation - transition - incorporation, Turner di fferentiates between structure - anti-structure - structure. Turner does not define structure in the Lévi-Straussian sense as a s ystem of `unconscious' logical categories, but refers to it simply as \"social structure\", that is, a d ifferentiated system of mutually dependent institutions and structural positions which may or may not be hierarchically ordered (Turner, Ritual 166). Individuals who are part of social structure are defined by their social positions, statuses and roles. Due to their pos ition in a social network they are expected to act in accordance with certain customary norm s and ethical standards bound up with their social position and the social system as a w hole. As soon as the state of a person is subject to change, such as in the process of m aturation or at the initiation into another social position or group, this person is detache d from its former position in the social structure, undergoes a process in which h is or her structural"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"attributes become temporarily ambiguous or neutralised, and finally re- emerges into social structure, usually (but not generally) at a higher status level. Turner de scribes the attributes of a liminar (i.e. a person in a threshold position) as necessari ly ambiguous, since this condition and these persons elude or slip through the network of c lassifications that normally locate states and positions in cultural space. Liminal entitie s are neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremonial. (Turner, Ritual 95) Turner describes liminars also as structurally \"invisible\", by whic h he means that they are \"no longer classified and yet not classified\" (Turner, \"Betwixt\" 6) and t herefore hard to grasp by a mind that is trained to perceive only clearly-defined objects: The subject of passage ritual is, in the liminal period, structurally, if not physically, \"inv isible.\" As members of society, most of us see only what we expect to see, and what we expect to see is what we are conditioned to see when we have learned the definitions and classificatio ns of our culture. A society's secular definitions do not allow for the existence of a not-boy-not -man, which is what a novice in a male puberty rite is (if he can be said to be anything). (Turner, \"Betwixt\" 6) The anti-structural period described by Turner is clearly identic al with Van Gennep's definition of a transitional period. In his analysis of anti-structur e Turner goes a step further than Van Gennep, however, when he starts to focus on other forms of li minality. Basically, he distinguishes between three forms of liminality. The fi rst is ritual liminality, which forms the major point of interest in Van Gennep's works. Ri tual liminality forms the central element in transitional processes (such as maturation) and in any kind of initiation ceremony. Ritual liminality always implies the re-incorporation of the li minar into social structure. The two other forms of liminality are outsiderhood and marginalit y. Unlike ritual liminality, outsiderhood and marginality usually are semi-permanent or permanent forms of anti-structural existence, which means that the re-incorporat ion of the liminar (i.e. the outsider or marginal) back into structure is often difficult , impossible or unwanted. Outsiderhood is defined by Turner as a condition in which the indivi dual is either permanently or temporarily \"set outside the structural arrangements of a given social system, (...) or voluntarily setting himself apart from the behaviour of status -occupying, role-playing members of that system\" (Turner, Dramas 233). Monastic orders, for example, show characteristics of anti-structure in that they emphasise the un importance of status, property and other cultural differentiae . A monk has in common with a pilgrim that both retreat from social structure to enter \"a stage of reflection\" (Tur ner, \"Betwixt\" 14). A pilgrimage, however, is a ritual process which is usually limited in tim e and ends when the pilgrim returns to his or her everyday life. A monastic retreat, on the other hand, is a liminal form of existence which has become a permanent condition. Accord ing to Turner, also shamans, prophets, hippies and gypsies count as outsiders, because they l ead a life at the boundaries of or opposed to the prevailing social structure. Another rep resentative of outsiderhood is the artist (whom Turner also calls `edgeman' Ritual 128), who is careful not to be associated with established social structures and tries to resis t classification. Outsiderhood, in short, is a condition in which an individual is located outside social structure, usually with no intention or ability to re-integrate."},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"Marginals, on the other hand, are \"simultaneously members (...) of two or more soc ial groups whose social definitions and cultural norms are distinct from , and often even opposed to, one another\" (Turner, Dramas 233). Turner's definition of marginals is mainly based on an earlier sociological study of marginality by Everett V. Stonequist, w ho describes a marginal person as an \"individual who through migration, educ ation, marriage, or some other influence leaves one social group or culture with out making a satisfactory adjustment to another and who finds himself on the margin of eac h but a member of neither\" (Stonequist 2-3). Migrant foreigners, persons of mixed ethnic origin or women in a changed, non-traditional role, to name but a few, belong to the group of marginals. Due to their special social condition, marginals are highly cons cious/self- conscious individuals who produce a high number of writers, artists an d philosophers. The social significance of the marginal is summarised in Stonequist's wor k as follows: The marginal man is a personality type that arises at the time and place where , out of the conflict of races and cultures, new societies, new peoples and culture s are coming into existence. The fate that condemns him to live, at the same time, in two w orlds is the same which compels him to assume, in relation to the worlds in which he lives , the rôle of a cosmopolitan and a stranger. Inevitably he becomes, relatively to his cultural m ilieu, the individual with the wider horizon, the keener intelligence, the m ore detached and rational viewpoint. (Robert E. Park, introduction, Stonequist xvii-xviii) Marginals, like ritual liminars, are betwixt and between clearly defined social states, but, unlike them, they have no prospect of a final stable resolution of their am biguity: they will never be fully integrated into the one side or the other (Turner, Dramas 233). This ambiguous position distinguishes marginals from outsiders: while the f ormer is situated in between different or opposing social groups, the latter retreats to a posit ion at the boundaries of the established social system. Even though anti-structure might show in different disguises (as r itual liminality, outsiderhood or marginality), its characteristics are often identical: li minars are symbolically or virtually bereft of status, which, consequentially, implies that they are also bereft of all the rights that go with status. This has two implications: fi rst of all, due to the absence of a hierarchy of status positions, there is equality among liminars. T his means that the occupants of one and the same anti-structural zone (such as monks in a monastic community, or hippies, or initiants in an initiation ritual) are aware of t heir equal positions. Secondly, Turner ascribes to ritual liminars, outsiders and marginals a pos itive force, because liminal existence, whether temporary or permanent, forces th e liminar to reconsider central values of his or her culture. Especially art, which b est develops in the interstices or on the edges of society, is a medium which questions th e prevailing social structure, and which is provoking, paradoxical, unusual, and above all, stimulat ing critical thought. The social counter-position allows liminars to have a clear view on the s tructure from which they are excluded, and although these individuals are usual ly bereft of privileges and in a condition of powerlessness, they carry the potential of c ritique of the norms of exactly that social structure. The danger that was ascribed to limin al personae by Van Gennep, in that they have lost their social attributes and therefore t heir guideline, takes a different shape in Turner's concept: anti-structure is not only \"a stage of"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"reflection\" (Turner, \"Betwixt\" 14) but a \"realm of pure possibility\" (T urner, \"Betwixt\" 7) in which new ideas and concepts are stimulated and generated, represe nting a danger to those who hold positions of power and command in social structure. Babbitt argues that in many cases, people must undergo personal transformat ion in order to conceive of themselves as fully human. Babbitt uses the term \"person al transformation\" to mean a transformative liberatory shift in consciousness. She thinks t hat the necessity of such shifts is particularly clear in cases of systemic oppression, wher e members of oppressed groups must think outside the (oppressive) interpretat ive framework provided for them. Babbitt argues that in order for members of deeply oppressed group s to gain access to their objective interests they must sometimes undergo l iberatory personal transformation. Such a transformation would include the sort of change t hat a person who has been deeply discriminated against might have to undergo in order to think of herself as possessing inherent dignity. Knowledge is a road to some practical or theoretical success while underst anding is necessary for mastering any situation either in a real or a virtual world. At th e same time understanding is only one of the hypostases of reflectivity , that is why not understanding is to be taught but reflectivity. In this connection another metaphor could have been used: anti-reflectivity, defence of impulsivity against reflectivity is the road to the wrong. And as soon as that second road enters our consideration, the term `reflectivity' and the corresponding notion begin approaching the topics of Law and Morality. It is on ly reflectivity that brings man to an experience of living with dignity, the i dea of meeting death with dignity, an experience of loving concrete human beings along with loving one's own life and the whole human race. Life, Death, Love make the experiential nucleus of our individual existen ce (Ustin, 1997), and this nucleus being present, the other few central meanings of e xistence will be manifested: Truth, Freedom, Beauty, the Good as the opposition of the Evi l, maybe Fate as one's inevitable Future. To come to mastering all these existential m eanings it is not enough to live one's natural life hoping for all this coming to the subjectivity of a \"m yself\" as an individual. Just the opposite: one is to exercise hard, but exercise har d not in a ready-made knowledge, not even in a ready-made understanding but in reflectivit y as the link connecting the lived experience with the gnoseological image under maste ry (Kornienko, 1991). In reflectivity the image is tinted by man's individual experience, an d as for experience, it does not immediately change while something more importan t is happening to it: it is our attitude towards it that is getting changed. In this way we are changed ourselves, and this change is one to the better if the process of reflecti vity serves socially and morally adequate aims. Reflectivity is the only instrument for an indivi dual and a collective to become wiser, kinder and purer. In alchemy, the images of figurative death appear during the operation called mortificatio. This symbolic experience of death has to do with darkness, defeat, torture, mutilation, death, rotting, penance, and abstinence--denial of the body. Emotionally it mean s the primitive, violent outbursts, resentments, and pleasure and power deman ds of Poseidon- consciousness must die for the process of transmutation to occur. Para doxically, we must make ourselves miserable for the process of transmutation to proceed. T hen the dark images change to positive ones of growth, resurrection and rebirth."},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"In consciousness journeys, we find fear is the primary agent of mortifi catio. Moving toward the fear and pain--deepening it--brings one closer to the tranformation . Images of feces, excrement, overflowing toilets are found in dreams and during spontane ous journeys in Thanatos-consciousness. It feels like defeat and failure. Yet, to resis t seems like madness--in fact, it induces madness. Those with near-death experiences tell u s that to embrace death brings about deeper meaning and purpose in life. Rotting corpses, decapitation, amputation, creeping, crawling worms and sna kes, and particularly noxious odors like the stench of graves are images which are rep orted again and again. It is truly a journey through \"the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\" Thus the psyche depicts the decay of outworn forms in preparation for new. It can be a vol untary death, giving up the old order for the sake of wholeness, the incorruptible b ody that grows from death. The infantile, personalistic ego is eclipsed. The journey to th e land of the dead (collective unconscious) opens one to transpersonal life. When we sit quietly we notice that images come--and images go, of their own ac cord. They are spontaneously created and destroyed through the psychic process. Some of t hese images are projections. When we withdraw them from their external \"hooks\" and re-own them, reabsorb them, they dissolve and \"die.\" This furthers individ uation. Plato said that \"true philosophers make dying their profession,\" referring to the wisd om inherent in this process. What is natural and instinctual is allowed to die and transform. Western attitudes toward death and dying have changed markedly in the last f ew years. There is talk of \"dying with dignity,\" and efforts toward assisting suici de for the terminally ill. It is a reaction to the dehumanization of dying. The Hemlock Society has bee n in the forefront of this debate, advocating free choice. There is much more talk about near-death experiences (NDE) and so -called astral projection or out-of-body experiences (OOBE). Astral projection follow s the same process described by those who report NDEs. They say attention is withdrawn fr om the limbs and trunk to the pineal area in the brain. Then consciousness passes out of the body through the top of the head. Many then report traversing a winding tunnel, and heading into the Light. Those who experience NDE find new purpose and meaning in life; the y usually seek to render service to others, becoming more selfless, humble, and confid ent in the future. Having faced the ultimate fear they gain a sureness on the path of life. Frequ ently they receive some \"message\" about their duties in life, what they are to devot e this \"second chance\" to achieving. They are infused with wisdom--simply knowing wh at they must now do. It is the death of selfishness. Some report seeing other entities; they are met there by \"others.\" Re ports of this nature have offered some comfort or solace to the living, who inherently feel that the se accounts offer descriptions of the passing into an afterlife. Others stoically fe el that death is a final annihilation of the soul. The hospice movement, initiated by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, M.D., approac hes the care of the terminally ill with respect. Her books, ON DEATH AND DYING; QUESTIONS AND"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"ANSWERS ON DEATH AND DYING ; and DEATH, THE FINAL STATE OF GROWTH are now classics on the subject, as is Feinstein and Mayo's RITUALS FOR LIVING AND DYING. Kubler-Ross and other have developed therapeutic programs using psychod rama to free up the negative aspects of the personality. This provides a means for the old personality to die, leaving room for the emergence of the new while life goes on. Psychodrama allows the survivors of the terminal patient, as well as the pati ents themselves, a means of expressing and grieving old wounds and pains. This facilitates development of new patterns of living. The goal is to allow a fresh sense of pers onal well- being and contentment. For most, there is the discovery of new values and a d eeper sense of appreciation for the gift of life--whatever life remains. Keywords for Thanatos include: abortion annihilation death decay destruction depth entropy euthanasia fear hypnotic limitation liberation morbid mystical meditation near-death experience (NDE) pathology capital punishment putrefaction rebirth rejuvinate terminal transitory transformation thanatology INTELLECTUAL IDEA Psychologically, Thanatos is the concept known as \"ego death\"--the death of the ol d self which creates the conditions for rebirth. The phenomena of rebirth m ay mean a \"born again\" Christian, or the \"twice-born\" of philosophy which also implies the spiritual, yet non-religious renewal of one's purposiveness in life. The major mystery of Masonic initiation includes the death-rebirth mystery. The initiate is symbolically murdered, sealed in a ritual tomb, later to arise as a resurr ected soul and brother of the Order. Israel Regardie quotes from the ceremony for Minor Adept grade in THE GOLDEN DAWN. \"Buried with that Light in a mystical death, rising again in a mystical res urrection, cleansed and purified through him our Master, o brother of the Cross of the Rose. Like him , O Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Like him have ye suffered tribulation. Poverty, tortur e and death have ye passed through; they have been but the purification of the gold.

Spiritual exploration, or sou l travel, is shared by all three modes of immersion in the universal stream of consci ousness. They are all variations on the theme of the consciousness journey, and echo our shamanic r oots, and the mythemes of eternal return and hero/heroine. Participants reach a deep, integral level, and direct experience of Higher Power, often merging with the Creation or the Creator. All these modes facilitate psychedelic consciousness, though any given experience may vary in duration and depth. Their prescribed frequency varies: medit ators are advised to \" die daily; \" in psychotherapy once a month may be enough for regenerative therapy; psychedelic use varies from single experiences, to monthly, to annually. D espite different modes of induction, all these experiences reflect the illusory natur e of time, space, and ego as reality constructs. The primary nature of consciousness is revealed. The word psychedelic has its roots in the Greek psyche, soul, and delos, vi sible, evident. It is direct evidence of the soul, the pure manifestation of soul. Stace (1960) id entifies nine qualities of the psychedelic experience as follows: 1) unity of all thin gs; 2) transformation of space and time; 3) deeply felt positive mood; 4) sacredness; 5) objectivity an d reality; 6) paradoxicality; 7) alleged ineffability; 8) transiency, and 9) persisting posit ive changes in subsequent behavior. In the practice of mysticism there is identification with progre ssively more subtle \"bodies\" or vehicles of consciousness, culminating in a transform from a mental or c ausal body to a vehicle of pure Light. In experiential psychotherapy, transformation resul ts from deepening within the flow of psychic imagery, progressively identifyi ng with more primal forms, and ultimately with formlessness. In psychedelic experience, e xpansion of consciousness dissolves ego boundaries leading to morphological transform ations and ecstatic communion. In alchemy, one sought not only to find or create the Stone, but also to apply it, or use it creatively in the everyday world. Now, we might speak of integrating or actualizi ng the results of our transformations in daily life. Thus, self-actualization or self-realization implies the grounding of the spiritual fruits of inner exploration. The liquid form of the Philosopher's Stone was known as the UNIVER SAL SOLVENT. According to the alchemists, the operation of solutio (liquification) has a twofold effect: it causes old forms to disappear and new regenerate forms to emerge. To a rigid consciousness, the primal ocean of the unconscious is experienced as chaot ic, violent, irrational processes of generation and destruction. Through \"creative regression,\" the generic form of ego death, consciousne ss recycles, recursively bending back upon itself. The direction is a recapitulati on of, a re-experiencing of sequences from earlier life, conception and birth experience, ance stral awareness, genetic and physiological recognitions, molecular and atomic perception, and q uantum consciousness. As consciousness explores and expands, ego dissolves. Pure consciousness, th e fundamental luminosity, is the ground state of unborn form. The generic purpose of ego de ath is to"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"liberate our embodied being, precipitating communion with and re-patte rning by the Whole. When all forms finally dissolve into unconditioned consciousne ss, the ground state of the Nature Mind is revealed as the mystic Void, the womb of creation. When the constructed forms which hold personality together are voluntaril y relinquished, consciousness \"liquifies\" and rapidly moves toward the unconditioned state. Though easy to say, it is sometimes difficult to achieve such liberation from the men tal-conceptual activity of the nervous system. When we do, the quiescent nervous system is ope n and receptive to the conscious recognition of pure energy transforms with n o interpretations. The Universal Solvent dissolves problems, heals, allows life to flow in ne w, creative patterns. These new patterns embody the evolutionary dynamic. According to ch aos theory, free-flowing energy is capable of self-organization. In consciousness this means that the obstructions to free flowing energy must first be dissolved. Throu gh re-creational ego death, consciousness dissolves into healing communion with the whole of existence, renewing itself, emerging with a new creative potential. The need for the periodic destruction of outmoded systems implies t he value of recycling consciousness through death/rebirth experience. The universal solve nt is not ordinary water, but \"philosophical\" water, the water of life, aqua permanens, aqua mer curialis. It is also the panacea, \" elixer vitae ,\" \"tincture,\" or universal medicine. To periodically dip into these healing waters has a tonic, rejuvenating effect which pervades all asp ects of being, like a soothing balm. Solutio implies the liquification of consciousness through the dissol ution of rigidities which inhibit free flow. They include roles, game patterns, defense strategi es, rigid attitudes and beliefs, interpretations, complexes, \"old\" myths, and \"frozen\" energy su rrounding traumas which manifests as fear and pain. Fossilized or ossified energies create obstructions to free flow, like boulders in a stream produce turbulen ce. Destructuring transformative processes can dissolve them, increasing the sense of flo w. This \"liquified\" consciousness is psychedelic, a nonordinary expanded awareness which d issolves fixations and habits, and loosens cramped attitudes. Mystic ecstasy, or the psychedelic state is mind-manifesting, consciou sness expanding. It dissolves the identification of our consciousness with our histories , bodies, emotions, thoughts, and even beliefs. We are free to explore myriad forms, structures , and patterns, and/or become formless, resting in that unborn, unconditioned, unmodif ied healing state. We experience the essence of other forms of existence. The Oneness of all life and existence is directly experienced through a variety of transformations ranging from plant and animal identifications to planetary and universal consciousness. Entering the turbulent flow of the stream of consciousness, we can r ide its currents back to the Source, pure unconditioned cosmic consciousness. We can imbibe th e life-giving qualities of this \"water\" through mind-expanding experiential contact w ith this deep consciousness. The transformative process is also reflected in our mod ern physical worldview as chaos theory, which we can view as a modern \"myth,\" a new metaphor f or the dynamics of consciousness. Chaos is ubiquitous in nature, pervading all dynamic"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"processes, perturbing them unpredictably. Chaos theory shows us that nat ure is continually unfolding new forms from the chaotic matrix of creation. Our dynamic consciousness is an essentially chaotic process. Chaos tracks a time evolution with sensitive dependence on initial conditions. When we \"return\" experientially to the \"initial conditions\" of our existence, our whole being is holistically r epatterned. Our historical limitations are superceded by the creative power of the eter nal Now. We can allow chaos, as the universal solvent, to liquify consciousness and re-creat e ourselves. This presumes a therapeutic atmosphere, a \"safe\" set and setting, because eac h phase of the journey is an encounter with uncertainty. The journey into deep consciousness appears inherently chaotic because the state of uncertainty pervades each moment of transition. Underlying moments of t ransience there are momentary blanks in awareness--little voids--flickering micros tates which repattern each phase. Whether the experience is one of loss of personal boundaries or d irect perception of stark, raw reality, or visionary dreams, there is no predicting w here the chaotic orbit of consciousness will roam next. To embrace chaos in our consciousness journeys, therefore means to coope rate and flow with the transformative process, opening ourselves to our deepest emerge nt potential. It's O.K. to let go periodically and temporarily become unstructured nothingnes s and open to holistic re-patterning. Chaos is self-organizing, self-iterating, and se lf-generating. It is an evolutionary force. The tendency of new forms emerging from chaos is toward a higher degree of adaptation, hence evolution (Kauffmann, 1991). This \"recycling\" of consciousness leads to a self-referential vortex. Chaotic systems revolve around nexus points, known as strange attractors, becaus e of their unpredictable quality. Rather than being \"point-like,\" they are more l ike vortices within vortices. The Philosopher's Stone is like a psychic lodestone (or vortex) . It acts like an inner magnet, ordering the contents of our consciousness around it (through fee dback loops) in chaotic, yet meaningful fashion. The Philosopher's Stone may thus be seen as a \"strange attractor\" in the l ife of anyone engaged in the quest for transformation. It is an instinctual attraction tow ard processes which dissolve the ego and liquify consciousness, leading to transpersonal experience after symbolic death/rebirth. Freedom in the exploration of imagery comes fr om the creative capacity to experience loss. Experientially, it appears as being channeled into the swirling mass of in teracting symbols, an overwhelming vortex of pure information. We are sucked inexorably into interac tion with the self-symbol, sucked into ourselves, like flotsam is pulled in to a whirlpool. This is the vortex of the system, the vortex of self, where all levels cross. It overwhel ms or tangles the mental processes, the self-imaging processes that maintain the i llusion of stable personality and individual boundaries. The classic text of re-creational surrender or sacrifice of self is THE BARDO THODOL , or THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD . It is explicitly for the living who undertake the death-like regression into the unconscious, as well as the dying. Because of their orientation"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"toward consciousness journeys, THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE and THE AMERICAN BOOK OF THE DEAD are useful translations or contemporizations of the transformational classic. The realm of death is the twilight zone between consciousness and matte r. Here psychoid phenomena manifest through the mingling of these modes. Here mind/m atter duality ceases, creating enchantment, uncanny synchronicities, time warps, psych ic experience, revelation of the mind of matter, the Nature Mind. The moment of ego deat h is heralded by certain symptoms of transition. Resistance by the mind to this creat ive dissolution brings about physical symptoms which range from shaking and a sense of increasing p ressure and anxiety, to paradoxical flashes of hot and cold, to extreme dizzyness and disorien tation. As the classic psychedelic manual says, \" The hard, dry, brittle husks of your ego are washing out; Washing out to the endless sea of creation.\" (Leary et al, 1964). Distressing or disturbing symptoms symbolize the violence of the pass age of consciousness from form to formlessness. Images of the body disintegrating or being blown t o atoms (fear of exploding = fear of expanding) are characteristic psychedelic experienc es. Perhaps the very elements of our bodies \"remember\" their formation in the crucib le of some supernova. There may be identification with merciless destruction , the Dance of Shiva, the raging elements of nature, a variety of forms of explosive discharge. Here are visions of fires, floods, raging storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, turbulent lakes of magma. Consciousness \"breaks up\" into its elemental forms, manifesting as over whelming imagery. This first phase of dissolution may be characterized by the futilit y of resistance, magnetic downward spirals, gravity wells, loss of morphological identity. E.J. Gold describ es the second stage of the voyage as one of being overwhelmed by illusions produced by conditioning. Yet the primal element of pure forms breaks through and the voyager recognizes \"the basic component of consciousness which when combined produces what i s called the element Water. \" In consciousness journeys, chaos functions as the universal solvent, that wh ich dissolves all patterns and forms including the rigid, outmoded aspects of the self. In the dream journey, one might enter a spinning vortex and become dismembered by centrifugal f orce, torn limb from limb. We remain in this state of dis-integration until we re-memb er our essential self, embodying the wounded healer. That sense of disintegration comes as the ego gives up its \"unified\" linear perspective (bivalent) to the multiple consciousness or awareness (multi-valenc e) of the deep self. Fear makes it feel like fragmentation, but in truth there is nothing in that imagery that is not us. The death throes of the ego prepare it for rebirth, through communion with c osmic consciousness, a new incarnation of the spirit, death and resurrection. T he nature of universal consciousness is oceanic. When the ego is in danger of \"getting in over its head,\" it panics as if faced with drowning in the depths of this vast ocean of cons ciousness. It overwhelms the ego which cannot fathom this abyss. This aspect of solutio brings mythic images of the dying god, of violent death and sacrifice, and of the isolation of the hero. It means nothing less than the sacrifice of the old self. The dissolution phase may mean myths of the triumph of darkness; myths of flood s and the"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"return of chaos, of the defeat of the hero. In Gold's words, \"Death comes to all forms; everything eventually is broken up by dissolution, so there's no point clingi ng to yet another biological form out of desire, longing for stability, or from fear and weakness.\" The death-rebirth sequence typically opens a person to the transperson al domain with its virtually infinite creativity. It reveals and unfolds our future potenti als. In dreamhealing, chaotic consciousness is also creative consciousness. Terence McKen na reminds us that, \"Riverine metaphors are endlessly applicable. They represent the flowin g of forces over landscapes, the pressure of chaos on the imagination to create creatively. . .The key is surrender and dissolution of boundaries, dissolution of the ego.\" When we immerse ourselves in that creative energy, we find healing on many l evels of our being. It may feel tingly or effervescent, or like streaming energy. Direct experience of this level brings a true sense of oneness with all that exists, the seamless fabric of existence. It opens us to re-patterning by the whole--a re-construction or re-patter ning of personality through holistic change at the most fundamental level. Immersion in the oceanic experience of universal consciousness is a lif e-changing experience. It is experience of the web of life, the biological life flo w, an ineffable current of bliss. Once we experience that larger world and self--the rhythmic p ulse of all life--we are never the same again, so long as we remember. Communing with this energy, expe riencing these states of consciousness, has been the practice of shamans since th e dawn of man. Shamanic consciousness means the ability to enter and exit altered state s at will. This power is connected to the liquid expression of life--the sap of life- -the vegetable forms of the liquid Stone, and its identity with psychotropic plants. This notion rei terates that of the \"greening of consciousness.\" Spiritual reincarnation means bringing to life that which was former ly dead or unawakened, through connection with the original creative power. It is the theme of the Quest -- the greening of the Wasteland. The process of rebirth is the myt hic enactment of \"the one story\" whose pattern is found in every narrative. Beneath the dif ferences, the meaning -- having to do with the loss and recovery of identity -- does not change. Th is story of the loss and regaining of identity is the framework of most literature, fr om which comes the hero with a thousand faces. Some variation of the hero's adventures, death, disappearance, and marriage or resurrection are the focal points of most stori es. The original sense of identity (romance and comedy), its loss (tragedy and i rony), and its recovery in the regenerate world of romance and comedy is mirrored in t he mythic quest. Myths of the birth of the hero, revival and resurrection, creation and defeat of the powers of darkness and death are perennial themes. The descent and subsequ ent ascent, going deep into the consciousness journey and emerging transformed, is a form of d eath/rebirth, a powerful archetypal theme which is initiatory in character. There is more than one form of rebirth. The notion emerges from the \"b elief system\" level of psyche, which combines mythical, archetypal, and personal elements. C arl Jung detailed five specific types of rebirth with a variety of psychological aspects. In ARCHETYPES OF THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS , he listed the forms of rebirth known to mankind as follows:"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"1. Metempsychosis. This means the transmigration of the soul from one body t o another at death. The soul is believed to have the ability to transmigrate among plant, anim al, or human forms. The change is not under the dominion of the will, but is the r esult of karma. The form is earned through one's deeds or misdeeds during life. 2. Reincarnation. This belief implies rebirth in human form, with some continuity or recall of personality. This is not only an eastern or Indian concept. At various times, i t was embraced by the Hebrew and Greek cultures. It was expunged from THE BIBLE by Justinian and Theodora in Byzantine times. The soul is believed to migrate from human form to human form with some purposeful development. 3. Resurrection. Here the idea is the re-establishment of human exist ence after death, either through resurrection of the physical body, or in the glorified or \"subtle bod y\" of pure Light. It signifies a perpetual state of incorruptibility. It is a transfor mation of one's essence or essential being; a transport to a new dimension of existence. 4. Rebirth (renovatio). When we experience renewal or improvement through self- development, or even a vacation which revivifies us, we go through a kind of psych ological rebirth. This rebirth takes place within the context of our individual life span. It may use magical, though not miraculous means of effecting change. The functioning of the personality may be enhanced, and we might feel r ejuvenated, healed, or otherwise strengthened. We can face the daily grind with renew ed zeal and effectiveness. Rites of passage frequently involve a ceremonial form of rebi rth, such as that of the adolescent into the adult world. When rebirth involves the transfor mation of the essence of our individuality, we are transmuted, or lifted from the human t o the divine realm of being. 5. Indirect Rebirth. This implies witnessing or taking part in some tran sformative rite, such as the Catholic Mass, or the Eleusinian Mysteries. A modern example is psychotherapy which initiates the process of individuation, hastening the process of natural transformation. By focusing on dreams and self-awareness we can speed up n ature's process of internal transformation. Our higher Self is revealed and we co me to know our soul as a special \"inner friend.\" Meditation is the spiritual means m ost frequently used to bring this change about, outside of the therapeutic setting. All forms of rebirth, in the psychological sense, are experiences of the tr anscendence of life. Transcendence is a natural progression from the finite, mortal frame th rough space, time, and the personal ego into infinite, immortal life beyond. It gives us access to t he experience of Cosmic Consciousness. The experience may be induced by ritual means , with or without direct participation. It may be a spontaneous, ecstatic revelation, or a sub jective transformation only. It frequently brings an enlargement of the personali ty, bringing richness and depth to life. Rebirth is experienced more easily, but not as deeply, through group part icipation or identification. In this case, the changes do not last, and one regresses to th e former condition. Only spiritual exercises, or yoga, provide a clearcut means to the fullest, permanent experience of personal transformation, and access to the higher Self.

SPIRITUAL MYTH The God of Death haunts us all, consciously or subconsciously. Particularly th e elderly are subject to a state which may be like a death in life--a paralysis from fear of w hat is to inevitably come. This event is a great moment, and some follow a natural urge to di e at the right time, relinquishing heroic life-prolonging efforts. Our culture makes valiant attempts to repress the awareness that lif e is based on death. Our overactive physical fitness binges are heroic attempts to deny that th e telos, or goal, of psyche is death. This is not the case in all cultures. They prepare th roughout life for death by putting dayworld notions to sleep. This radical shift in consciousne ss is expressed through metaphorical descriptors of death. Mystical philosophies encourage the aspirant to \"die daily\" by withdrawi ng into meditation. They recommend anywhere from 20 minutes to 1/10 of the day (2 1/2 hour s). The idea is to tithe a tenth of one's time, rather than money to experienci al spiritual practice. This admonishment to \"die daily\" was also the advice of magician A leister Crowley commenting on the Tarot Trump XIII, DEATH. Spiritual Masters, or Adepts, speak of the \"gates of death.\" They aid and teach the student to pass these gates and return to this plane at will. They help us solve th e problem of what lies beyond. Coming and going at will through these gates is the process of dyi ng while we live. This internal journey during meditation is routine to advanced stude nts. During meditation consciousness is withdrawn from the external w orld and concentrated inside at the pineal gland, or eye center. This is what happens at the mom ent of death also, according to these teachers. The difference is that an adept who meditate s never loses consciousness when passing out of the body. He retains complete memory of his experiences which happened during absence from the body, in higher spiritual p lanes of existence."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Spiritual Masters, or Saints, describe four distinct classes or groups of people who meet with different sorts of experiences after physical death: 1. This group includes the bulk of mankind who have no living guide or spi ritual teacher. They meet death unsupported, in great fear, helpless in the face of thei r own karma. They are judged immediately after death, sometimes quite severely. They re turn on the wheel of rebirth, born into the type of body which they created through their stron gest desires in their past lives to fulfill their wishes. 2. This group have initiation from a living spiritual master, but didn't put much active emphasis on spiritual discipline or meditation (which balances or p ays off karma). They indulged in many passions, and will be reborn to continue their training on the path. However, their teacher informs them when their time of death is near and accompanies them during the transition. 3. Faithful devotees of a spiritual guide have made good progress, but haven't yet gaine d liberation from the wheel of life. Since they are familiar with death th rough dying daily, they pass over without difficulty or distress; they understand and acce pt death calmly. They are also escorted by their Master, and rejoice at their homecoming. Th ey need take a physical form no longer, and proceed to higher planes via their body of Light. Bet ween initiation by a Master and liberation, there is a maximum of four human incarn ations, instead of the eternal wheel of rebirth in various forms. 4. The final class consists only of Masters themselves. They leave the body when their work is done, simply putting it aside like soiled and worn clothing, and their s ouls merge back into God. Their duties and responsibilities fulfilled, they merged back into the Supreme One, who sends the great teachers here as embodiments of the Way. Perhaps one of the oldest traditional accounts of the western perennial p hilosophy concerning death and immortality comes down to us in The Hermetica , the Lost Wisdom of the Pharaohs (Freke & Gandy, Tarcher, 1997). In the ancient texts, Hermes Tri smegistus explores the nature of death and the fate of the soul which survives it. From our human point of view, time is a destroying force, for we all age and die. Bu t from the cosmic perspective, it is an endless cycle. We can participate in th at eternal realm through the spiritual quest, by learning to accept the inevitable transit ory nature of forms, including our own. Death is just the discarding of the worn-out body. Ac cording to ancieent wisdom, pure souls are assinged to the heavenly realm while ignoran t sould get recycled in the material realms. The Body of Light is recogized in East and West as the godlike form which transcends mortal death. According to The Hermetica: The end of becoming is the beginning of destruction. The end of destruction is the beginning of becoming. Everything on Earth must be destroyed, for without destruction nothing can be created."},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"The new comes out of the old. Every birth of living flesh, like every growth of crop from seed, will be followed by destruction. But from decay comes renewal, through the circling course of the celestial gods, and the power of Nature, who has her being in the Being of Atum. For man, time is a destroyer, but for the Cosmos it is an ever-turning wheel. These earthly forms that come and go are illusions. How can something be real which never stays the same? But these transitory illusory things arise from the underlying permanent reality. Birth is not the beginning of life - only of an individual awareness. Change into another state is not death - only the ending of this awareness. Most people are ignorant of the truth, and therefore afraid of death, believing it to be the greatest of all evils. But death is only the dissolution of a worn-out body. Our term of service as guardians of the world is ended when we are freed from the bonds of this mortal frame and restored, cleansed and purified, to the primal condition of our highest nature. After quitting the body, Mind, which is divine by nature, is freed from all containment, Taking on a body of Light, it ranges through all space - leaving the soul to be judged and punished, according to its deserts. Souls do not all go to the same place. Nor to different places at random."},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"Rather, each is allocated to a place that fits its nature. When a soul leaves the body it undergoes a trial and investigation by the chief of the gods. When he finds a soul to be honorable and pure, he allows it to live in a region that corresponds to its characteristics. But if he finds it stained with incurable ignorance, he hurls it down to the storms and whirlwinds, where it is eternally tossed between sky and earth on the billowing air. Only a godd soul is spiritual and divine. Having wronged no one and come to know Atum, such a soul has run the race of purity, and becomes all Mind. After it leaves its physical form, it becomes a spirit in a body of Light, so that it may serve Atum. At the dissolution of the body, first the physical form is transformed and is no longer visible. The vital spirit returns to the atmosphere. The bodily senses go back to the universe, and recombine in new ways to do other work. Then the soul mounts upwards through the structures of the heavens. In the first zone, it is relieved of growth and decay. In the second, evil and cunning. In the third, lust and deceiving desire. In the fourth, domineering arrogance. In the fifth, unbalanced audacity and rashness. In the sixth, greed for wealth."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"In the seventh, deceit and falsehood.

This is Primal Goodness. This is the consummation of True Knowledge. Having been initiated into immortality, a human soul, now tranformed into a god, joins the gods who dance and sing in celebration of the glorious victory of the soul.

It is usually ignored or denied outright, frequen tly obsessed over, and is sometimes the inspiration for uncharacteristic breaches of common sense. It is time to state the obvious. The problem of consciousness is deeply i nterwoven with the problem of death. And yet death is rarely mentioned in relation to conscious ness studies. Consciousness is the thing of consequence that dies. Surely this expl ains a great deal of why there is such an energetic conversation about consciousness, and why passi ons are so often raised concerning a subject whose basic nature is so elusive and dispu ted. The spectrum of attitudes in consciousness studies is strikingly s imilar to the variety of coping mechanisms for the existence of death.[1] There are those who imagin e they already somehow possess more knowledge about it than they have means to achieve. Ther e are those who believe nothing can ever be said about it. And then there are those w ho seem to wish to deny its existence. It is these latter who interest me the most. Life would certainly be simpler without consciousness. If consciou sness did not exist, much of philosophy would not exist. Daniel Dennett, a philosopher who claims not to be conscious, has already announced the end of ontology, and there have been numerous predictions from like minds that other branches of philosophy are mere stand-ins awaiting more developed science. So why won't consciousness just go away? What gives consciousness legs is the exi stence of subjective experience, something persistently elusive and of uncle ar consequence. Interminable constructions of thought and image have been created by c ountless generations of people in response to what is nothing more than a perfect point , a thing with no quality and no content. It is a tale out of Borges. A shelf of mathematics books de voted to one numeral alone. A vast museum that displays only one pixel. With a sufficiently advanced neurotechnology, it should presumably be pos sible to reliably and repeatably construct mental phenomena, such as qualia, in detail by se tting values in neurons. This would be an experience confirmable by anyone who plays w ith the gadgets that accomplish it. `Brainoramas' would no doubt be the new consumer e lectronics blockbusters; pure experience machines. These machines would not claim to become conscious themselves, but rather would allow human users a precise tec hnological route to controlling the detailed content of their own subjective experience ."},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"A brainorama would consist of three parts. One would be a hat that contains sen sors capable of reading and writing the states of each neuron in your brain at a rapi d rate. There would also be a display that shows you what's going on in your brain, and allow s you to edit it. Connecting these would be a computer capable of recognizing and syn thesizing neural patterns. I won't attempt to guess at what future century might b e capable of producing this device. A lazy customer could be given an adventurous experience or deep wisdom, acc ording to the current fashion. One can predict that the use of these machines might follow the pattern set earlier by psychedelic drugs and music synthesizers. Syn thetic experiences that were initially fresh and extreme quickly become banal, as intensity i s maximized in all directions until it becomes meaningless. Following that will be th e realization that `there is no free lunch', that the construction of creativity in thought, beauty in c reation, or depth in character requires as much or more work in the purely informational worl d of brainorama as it does in real life. In the end, however, the nature of these exotic new objectively controlle d subjective experiences will still remain a nagging mystery. Why must experience be the re at all? How can one prove if it is or isn't there? Nothing will have changed in these que stions, except that we'll be able to observe the questions themselves as brain phenomen a directly for the first time using brainoramas. Imagine watching your thoughts on the philosophy of consciousness go by on the sc reen [2] of a brainorama. Suppose you start to think that maybe consciousness is everywhe re, and that is why you can't capture it — and at that moment you see a familiar cloudy squ iggle in your cortex, above your ear, similar to the last time you thought the same thing. The pattern recognizer in the brainorama computer catches it too, and a `Chalme rs' alert starts blinking. Instead of thinking from the inside, you decide to use the styl us to sketch some narrower loops on your Chalmers squiggle and feel what the thoughts are like. S uddenly you don't find consciousness credible anymore, and indeed a `Dennett' alert is flashing on the screen. But thoughts have a way of springing back to their original form, like memory metals. Other parts of your cortex are automatically alerted into action to repai r the damage and soon you see your familiar thought squiggles appear on the screen, just as you find yourself thinking, `But wait a second, consciousness IS there!'[3] I suspect that trying to track down consciousness [4] with a brainorama will feel like trying to fi nd the butterfly whose wing flutterings are to be the cause of a hurricane on the other s ide of the world. As you browse through your brain, you are able to see the full extent of your memor y. It is as if, after living your whole life inside a great canyon of unknown dimension s, you are able to climb to a lookout point on the rim for the first time. For a moment you ar e impressed with the vastness of what you see. But soon an overwhelming sense of the fini tude of your own brain appears as a particularly murky and awkward squiggle. A blinker sign als that you are beginning to think about death. The nature of consciousness should reasonably be expected to explain the nature of death. For example, if Penrose is right, then consciousness simply ceases whe n the microtubules dissipate. If Dennett is right, consciousness wasn't there in the f irst place, so death isn't such a big deal. The mysteries of death and consciousness are not the same, t hough. Death"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"cannot tell us as much about consciousness as consciousness can tell us about death. If we knew that consciousness did not survive death, for example, we still wouldn 't know what consciousness was before death. Consciousness has historically been linked with the idea of the soul , primarily in order to substantiate an afterlife. This was not exclusively among excitable relig ious types. By Plato's account, Socrates' precise mind found subjective experience axiomatic enough to suggest that it must reside in a realm all of its own, which must be reve aled in death. Among the religious, of course, consciousness has generally served as an intu itive confirmation of elaborate articulated fantasies of the hereafter, especial ly in the West.[5] The difference between the religious and the secular has often been no more than the degree of elaboration and specificity in these fantasies. Alas, the fear of death has been exploited to create empires. For this reason , scientists and political liberalizers have often been allied to combat dogmatic religiou s authority. The twentieth century saw the rise to prominence of a culture that was in large part a reaction against the arbitrary and sometimes exploitative nature of death-denial fant asies. In the late twentieth century a bizarre and inverted form of death-deni al has been gaining ground. It is the ironic grandchild of an earlier generation of rational though t that sought to quell all such sentimentality. In this new fantasy, technology will conq uer death. In the literature of cryonics and nanotechnology one frequently comes across argume nts that we are already within shooting distance of the goal. Nanotechnology might be used to cr eate a supercomputer that will quickly figure out how to make nanomachine s that can repair the human body and make old age an anachronism. Or cryonics will preserve our bodies un til a happy time in the future when they are expected to be thawed by gentle ent husiasts for antiquity. Or, perhaps most tellingly, the contents of our brains will be read into durable computers, so that our minds will continue after our bodies cease to fun ction. Consciousness is at best a wildcard, and at worst an outright affront to these f antasies. Subjective experience is undeniably present, for those of us who have i t, anyway. (I've proposed elsewhere that some philosophers just don't have it. See Lanie r, 1995.) It is the only thing that would be just as real if it were somehow shown to be an illus ion or a mistake; if it is there in any way whatsoever, it is fully there, undeposab le, the most primary thing. And yet it has no definitive measurable effect on anything e lse. The coincidence of these two qualities makes it awkward. It is utterly uncl ear how consciousness `binds' to the empirical universe. There is absolutely no way to know what the subjective experience of havin g one's brain state transferred into a computer, leaving the body to be disposed of, or even of being frozen and thawed, would be. Even if these things were tried, those who h adn't themselves had the experience would only be able to rely on the reportage of the purport ed survivors who did, and the readouts of their brainoramas. The cold truth is that you have to die to test these ideas.[6] The living are unable to know if technological reduct ions of consciousness are valid. We have come to the fundamental problem for the new death-denialists: if consciousness exists, then technological forms of avoiding death are absolutely as uncertain as old"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"fashioned death itself. The `hard problem' kind of consciousness i s the enemy of the new death-denial fantasy, and there is no stronger source of passion than the d efence of such a fantasy. So consciousness is made to not exist. Here is the engine under the hood of consciousness denial. A literature already exists of the new death-de nialists. The theorists are Minsky, Dennett, Hofstadter. The authors of new romantic liturgies are T ipler, Moravec and Drexler. The tragedy of traditional death-denial based on a religious fantasy is that t he fantasy must have specific, yet ultimately arbitrary, content. Therefore it is freq uently the case that people find themselves holding mutually exclusive death-denial fantas ies. This is why traditional religion is divisive. Christianity and Islam cannot both be tru e in their most literal sense. This provides a potential ethical advantage for the new death- denialists. If people can agree on one simple tenet, that subjective experience, the pe a, does not exist, then they can share in the objective world of empirical confirmation on all the other points that matter. They can agree, for instance, on whether a brain has survived its c ryo-, nano-, or cyber-transition into immortality.[7] Nonetheless, the new and old styles of death-denial are even more in dis agreement with each other than any old-styled pair have ever managed to be. The chasm between d eath- denial fantasies provides a worthwhile approach for understanding some of the most frustrating current events. Is it a coincidence that religious fundam entalism is experiencing a resurgence at just the time that science is starting to touch some of t he most intimate aspects of human identity? Today's social conflicts are more likely to be abou t technologies that challenge our definition of death, such as abortion, than about the dis tribution of wealth. Footnotes 1 Certainly the fear of death has been one of the g reatest driving forces in the history of thought an d in the formation of thecharacter of civilization, and yet it is unde r-acknowledged. The great book on the subject, The Denial of Death, by ErnestBecker (1973), deserves a reconside ration. Even as the psychoanalytic tradition seems to be on the wane, this book holds upremarkably well. 2 The screen is what we are most familiar with in 1 997, but make no mistake, any upmarket brainorama w ill actually have avirtual reality interface, so that y ou find yourself inside a three dimensional represe ntation of your own brain. 3 You might wonder how you avoid becoming lost in a n infinite regress of watching your thoughts of wat ching your thoughts.That is simple. The brainorama computer is programmed to filter out this kind of resonant fee dback. 4 Just to be clear, I am talking about the `hard pr oblem' kind of consciousness. The `easier' kind of consciousness (thatanaesthetists can make go away) is undoubtedly localizable, since it is an empirical phenomenon, and it would seem to beprimarily associated with the core areas of the brain rather than with the cortex. 5 Christianity, a post-platonic religion, was prima rily founded not on the exceptional emanations of b urning bushes, demons, orother extraordinary objects, but on the r eports of people of apparently ordinary form, Jesus and Lazarus, who could confirmthe continuity of consciousness af ter death. (While reports of Jesus' life do contain some other supernatural events, like walking on water, these a re surely not as vital to the religion.) In Christi anity the physical world became more ordinary and the hereafter more b aroque, especially as the religion developed over t he centuries. 6 Note that you do NOT have to die to test a Braino rama, so long as you use it gingerly. 7 This only provides a potential unity in the under standing of facts — it certainly doesn't suggest any unity of motivation. In fact, the cliché would seem to be th at conciousness-free people face a crisis of meanin g and lack grounds for motivation in any shared direction.

An image of that conjunction is the eclipse. Artemis, as the Amazon ( or martial maid) is an adolescent stage of the High Priestess (Trump II). She is the patroness of youth. As a virgin, Artemis suggests that capacity of the psyche to serve as an intact vess el of containment. The High Priestess has incorporated the Solar aspect withi n herself. This is not so with Artemis, as the Amazon. Her solar twin, Apollo, represen ts her spiritual animus personfied. It is a tandem relationship where they are twins of the same mother. Because she represents a less-mature aspect of herself, her solar co mponent is projected as Apollo. Apollo wants no competitors. As an example of this, consider the introspec tive, but dedicated young artist or musician, whose love affairs pale in comparison wit h the consistency and inspiration of her creative spirit. Her love affair is with her art; she love the inspiration. She is an \"arty-ms.\" Artemis is typically in motion, darting and flitting. However, she always se ems to be moving away most of the time, gaining distance from things. Hunting is an aspect of h er supervision over the life and death of wild animals, symbolizing our untrans formed instincts. In modern life she may hunt with a camera, or hunt and gather other things, such as art collections or research. Her sexual drive is quite natural, but Artem is as Amazon lacks the cultural refinements of a sophisticated lover. These qualities of Artemis, the deep interiority, pristine fresh ness, imaginal containment, and freedom from external containment are similar to puer psychology. Both are a movement inward, away from pragmatism and heroic acts, toward imagination. She r ules the woman's mysteries (\"Ms.teries\"). For these and other reason, Artemis/Apollo represents the Trump XI V, Art. Art is a process, moving from the Lunar to Solar aspects on the Middle Pillar, from u nconscious, occult or hidden forms toward full conscious awareness. This represen ts a transmutation of opposites, forming an androgynous figure. Artemis/Apollo was originally known as Temperance because when they merge with consciousness, they temper , combine and harmonize the psychic and material natures of the Moon and the Sun. This classic twin-set joins wildness and terror on the borderlin e of equilibrium. Artemis experiences phenomena androgynously while retaining her femininit y. She confers full- fledged transformations through expanding consciousness, not through a sexual role- reversal. In the blending of opposites, Artemis presents the anima (or diffuse consciousness) and Apollo represents the animus (or logical processes ). In Greek mythology, Artemis is the daughter of Leto and Zeus, and twin sis ter of Apollo. Artemis is the goddess of the wilderness, the hunt and wild animals , and fertility (she became a goddess of fertility and childbirth mainly in cities). She was often depicted with the crescent of the moon above her forehead and was sometimes identifi ed with Selene (goddess of the moon). Artemis was one of the Olympians and a virgin goddess. Her m ain vocation was to roam mountain forests and uncultivated land with her nymph s in attendance hunting for lions, panthers, hinds and stags.

She was armed witha bow and arrows which were made by Hephaestus and the Cycl opes. In one legend, Artemis was born one day before her brother Apollo. Her moth er gave birth to her on the island of Ortygia, then, almost immediately after her birth, she helped her mother to cross the straits over to Delos, where she then delivered Ap ollo. This was the beginningsof her role as guardian of young children and patron of women in ch ildbirth. Being a goddess of contradictions, she was the protectress of women in labor , but it was said that the arrows of Artemis brought them sudden death while giving b irth. As was her brother, Apollo, Artemis was a divinity of healing, but also brought and spread d iseases such as leprosy, rabies and even gout. The fact that these archetypal dynamics are linked as twin-forces suggest s the primal effects of both sun and moon on the motions of earth and the e-motions of hum an beings. It is a well-documented phenomenon that solar flares or sunspots effect or c orrelate with disruptions in human behavior. The effect of moon, and Full Moon in particu lar, is reflected in the term lunacy . This effect is noted monthly by those in the medical, public safety and mental health fields. The Twins may be considered an archetypal basis of psi phenomena or the remote sharing of information among two or more individuals .

PHYSICAL FORM: ART (Trump XIV) depicts the alchemical blending of fire and water. F rom a biological perspective, the active hot principle of sulphur is attributed to the left hemisphere of the brain. The more passive, lunar principle of mercury is attributed to the right hemisphere. There are two nitrogen-containing organic compounds in the brain called ami nes. These two componds have been proposed as chemical mediators of the sympathetic an d parasympathetic systems of arousal. Noradtenalin corresponds to solar Apollo, and works through the sympathetic system. From this perspective, Apollo facilit ates adaption to external reality. Noradrenalin produces an excited, ancious state which cul minates in ecstasy. Serotonin corresponds with Artemis and the right hemisphere of the b rain. Working through the parasympathetic system it creates a relaxed condition, like m editation. Artemis/Apollo represents serotinin an noradrenalin being poured s imultaneously into the \"cauldron\", located in the hypothalamus or third Ventricle of the brain. It represents a pain-pleasure balance. Artemis/Apollo represents the Consummation of the Royal Marriage. In anc ient times, the brother-sister union was generally reserved for royal couples, and may be the root of this metaphor. When this chemical wedding occurs in our body, it produces the ab ility to remain active (noradrenergic) while inactive (serotonergic). This is u sing action to attain non-action, as in Buddhist meditation. This paradoxical state symbolizes th e twin divinities."},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"We experience brother/sister relations at the emotional level with am azonian women.

The Artemis woman is not interested in too much personal intimacy. She can seem aloof, cold, effiient, and even self-sufficient. She has little patience for weakness and sentimentality, and will be repugnant to the regressive side of man, wit h his anima possessions. She has no tolerance for moodiness. Artemis has a furtive and moonlit anxiety about sexual matters, but she is not p rudish. Her desire for personal privacy is territorial, not stemming from a fear of invasion .

With this androgynous nature, Artemis/Apollo woman feels confident that she can suceed in any chosen field (man's or woman's), provided she is proficient in he r craft (ART). This type dominates the equestrian field. Specific occupations associated with Artemis/Apollo are: CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE: Gianni and Donatella Versace Hades-Dionysus, intoxication's high!

CHAPTER XX: JUDGEMENT/AEON HADES - DIONYSUS "},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"Contrary to popular opinion Dionysus is not merely the god of revelry, indulgen ce, erotic compulsion and intoxication, but of ecstatic rapture. We see this rapture , or rising up, depicted in the tarot trump Judgement or The Aeon. Dionysus, rooted in the earth and ecstasy, is the prototype of shamanic descent and the dying and resurrecti ng godmen. This vegetation god also presides over or underlies prophecy, tragedy, ecstasy, and the violation of limits. He is the irrational power that allows us to explore our pot ential for emotional and behavioral extremes. The Irrational forces us to suspend logic, w ashes out the firm footing from beneath us, floods us with emotion, rips away false surety, claims us utterly, shakes us to the core, and sweeps us into heavenly heights and unde rworld depths inexorably full of the sense of mystery, the Unknown. The vine and ivy were sacred to this god; his sacrifices consisted of goats and pigs. The title \" Dithyrambos ,\" means \"twice born.\" Stories of his birth have Zeus either swallow ing his embryo or heart or sewing his embryo into his thigh for gestation. As Zeus' son he shares his will to power and creative drive. His childhood was spent in innocenc e and happiness among the nymphs, satrys, herdsmen, and vine-tenders of Nysa. His Artemisian nurses are linked to the moon and lunar consciousness of the dark. Dionysus was born of fire and nursed by rain, transformed by the hard burning heat that ripens the grape s and the water that keeps the plant alive. Dionysus is the god of all life-giving fluids. Dionysus 'died' with the coming of the cold. He experienced a terribl e death; he was driven mad, torn to pieces, in some stories by the Titans, in others by Hera's orde r. He is followed by his female devotees, the Maenads who are often seen in an ecstatic fren zy. He invented the vine from which wine is made -- he rules wine, drama, and revelry. He h ad power over life, death, and resurrection. He also had the formidable power of creatin g madness. He was a God who could be found often in darkness, but sometimes in light as w ell. Mardi Gras, Spring Break, and the Playboy lifestyle with its orgiastic rites, owes it s soul and phallic spirit to Hades-Dionysus as any follower of Dionysus can hope to be seized by the god in an ecstatic frenzy. Heraclitus says,'Hades and Dionysus, for whom they go mad and rage, are one and the same.' Dionysus was worshiped in Hellenistic times (after 332 BC) from Italy to Greece and into Egypt and the Middle East. The Greek Dionysus is mentioned in Line ar B tablets from roughly 1,200 BC. Herodotus describes initiation into the mysteries of Dionysu s in the fifth century BC. [Herodotus Histories book 4, 78 80], Euripides' play about him, T he Bacchae , was first performed about 400 BC. The Maenads, (Bacchantes) were Dionysus' female votaries who accompanied him when he traveled. Frenzied with wine they rushed through woods and over mountai ns uttering sharp cries, waving pine-cone-tipped wands (thyrsi). They danced and san g exultant songs, wearing fawn-skins over their robes. Nothing could stop them. They would t ear to pieces the wild creatures they met and devour the bloody shreds of flesh. The worship of Dionysus was centered in divergent ideas; of freedom and joy and of savage brutality. The reason that Dionysus was so different at one time from anoth er was because of the double nature of wine, his symbol. He was man's benefactor and he was m an's"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"destroyer, man's blessing sometimes his ruin. The double-nature is al so reflected in his sexual ambiguity. Due to the diversity of influences from the other gods, he easily gets “taken out of context.” Which explains why he habitually gets torn to pieces—as Jesus is continuall y crucified— only to have him disappear, and reappear with a new advent (rebirth). Of all the god s, Dionysus is least understood. He’s therefore best portrayed as god of wine, wh ich gets perverted when he becomes the Roman's Bacchus, the god of drunkennes s, hence the god of excess. Dionysus abhorred getting drunk. As humans we tend to go to extremes, and we obsessively lose sight of the “overall pi cture.” And in our endeavors, be it work, sports, religion, drugs—good or bad, etc.—we tend t o get fixated or drunk on what we’re doing, with compulsive fanaticism. Anythin g which like wine can lead to pleasure but also disorientation, unrestrained action, and d ire consequences can be seen in this way. We call this neurosis or, addictive b ehavior, and it gives rise to the term “inflation,” being full of hot air. In its extremes physical or emotional intoxication is an escapist journey to oblivion. Robert A. Johnson’s book, Ecstasy, Understanding the Psychology of Joy, is written specifically about Dionysus and the “ecstatic experience,” and its loss in our western culture. Another excellent book is Craving for Ecstasy , (Milkman and Sunderwirth, 1987). Stan and Christina Grof write on addiction as a spiritual emergency ( Stormy Search for the Self, 1990) and divine madness, spiritual emergence and renewal ( Spiritual Emergency: When Personal Transformation Becomes a Crisis , 1989). Himself a mystery god, and god of vegetation, Dionysus was also initiated into the mysteries of Demeter, the goddess of the grain: the Eleusinian mysteries or myster ies of the dead, involving the afterlife. Though somewhat effeminate, Dionysus is essen tially the masculine counterpart of Persephone. In earlier accounts, Dionysus was the son of Pe rsephone, the daughter of Demeter, or even the son of Demeter (as Iacchus). As mother and daughter the two were inseparable, suggesting a closer affinity to Demeter, hence the god of bread and wine, as is Jesus in Matthew 26:26-30 Mark 14:22-26. The mysteries of Demeter also involved the “secrets of the couch.” Karl Kerenyi, in his book on Eleusis, clearly shows that many ancients reveal ed what the secret was, beginning with Euripedes in some of his plays. The secre t was that Dionysus and Hades are the same. This meant that Dionysus is also the Lord of the Dead, t he Lord of the Underworld. In modern psychological terms, it is the difference be tween relating to this dynamic through its pathological aspect (addiction; drunkeness and their relation to a hellish underworld of criminality, violence, greed and death) or its tr anspersonal aspect (ecstasy, bliss, rapture, transcendence or elevation to 'Olympus,' realm of the gods). The sufferings which the god was supposed to endure in winter led h im to be associated with Demeter in the mysteries of Eleusis. His spring festival, the Great Dionysia, was open to all the world. The procession of followers carried a replica of the god an d replicas of his phallus. The ceremony became more elaborate each year. Drama develope d out of his worship."},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"Theater became the scene of splendid dramatic performances. The poe ts were the prophets and priests. Actors and singers took part in the sacred performances. All or dinary business was stopped, no one could be put into prison, and spectators along with the wr iters and the performers, were engaged in an act of worship whose purpose was to purif y the emotions. The greatest poetry in Greece was written in tragic plays and was never e qualed except by Shakespeare. Comedies were produced but tragedies far outnumbered th em. Like Persephone Dionysus died with the coming of the cold. Unlike her , his death was terrible: he was torn to pieces, in some stories by the Titans, in others by Hera's orders. He was always brought back to life. He presented death and resurrection whic h first centered in Persephone, but she held power in death as queen of the Underwor ld. Dionysus was never thought of as a power in the kingdom of the dead. He only rescued his mothe r from it. Dionysus is intrinsic to the Eleusinian Mysteries of healing and transf ormation. Dionysus is linked to the Maenads and other female companions, as Krishna is to the Gop is. Dionysus was Zeus's youngest immortal son. In a group of the tales concerning him, he was b orn of a mortal mother. In other stories Dionysus was held to be a son of Persephone, an d received the surname of Chthonios, \"the subterranean,\"another link to the world of t he dead. In this form, Dionysus may have literally been a psychedelic which spri ngs up from beneath the earth, either the magic mushroom or ergot (growing on grain st ored underground), used in the secret mystical brew, the kykeon . This potent magical brew produced visions and an experience of metaphorical death and rebirth, e mulating the dying and resurrecting god of the grain. Psychedelic experience often contains imagery of dismemberment in the early stages of ego-death, and often a passage through th e underworld. The afterglow of the experiential journey is perceived as a renewal or rebirth. One of the names given to the child's father is that of Hades. When Persephon e had eaten the pomegranate seed she left her husband only reluctantly or, according to anot her tale, she never left him at all. She was honored and sacrosanct queen of the Realm of the Dead. This represents, however, only one aspect of what was, in fact, a great god. But we k now that Persephone's husband was also called Zeus Katachthonios, \"subterr anean Zeus\", and that it was Zeus who seduced his daughter. As Katachthonios, Zeus was the f ather of the subterranean Dionysus, and in the same quality he was also called Zagreus, \"th e great hunter\". This was also one of the names of his son. Dionysus had many & various for ms. Even though he did not actually appear as a mask - carried by men or hung up to b e worshipped - he had a peculiar, fascinating mask-face. Ancient portrayals show him holding in his hand the kantharos, a wine-jar with large handles, and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades. On a vase by the archaic master Xenokles we see, on one side, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, each wi th his emblems of power, the last has his head turned back to front and, on the othe r side, the subterranean Dionysus welcoming Persephone, who is obviously being se nt to him by Hermes and her mother. Dionysus is striding forward to meet his bride : a bearded, dark bridegroom, with the kantharos in his hand, against a background of grapes. Or is this the scene of parting? If so, one sees that the goddess will return to this spous e."},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"In most tales, however, Dionysos appears as a tender boy, the son of his mother. She, indeed, immediately disappears and is soon replaced by loving nurses. We can r ecognize the two aspects that Zeus also displayed: on the one hand, of the father and hu sband, and on the other, of the son of the divine child. Throughout mythology other beings bes ides Zeus and Dionysos had this double aspect. But no other god so much appeared to b e a second Zeus as Dionysos did: a Zeus of women, admittedly, whereas the Olymp ian was much more a Zeus of men. The more characteristic animals of these two god s were the serpent and the bull, both of which appeared in the Mediterranean e arlier than the horse. The tale that Zeus mated with Persephone's mother, and later with Pe rsephone herself, his own daughter in the form of a serpent, has been preserved only in an Orphic story, and only in a few fragments. The place of these marriages, and the births that r esulted from them, was a cave. The goddess by whom Zeus begat Persphone was originally his moth er Rhea. Demeter appears as a third party interposed between the mother and daughter, both of whom appeared earlier in Greece than she did. She is described as Rhe a's alter ego, yet she is also identified with Persephone. Zeus begat Dionysos, so it is exp ressly stated, by Demeter or by Persephone. After his descent to Hades' underworld to retrieve his lost love Euryd ice, Orpheus became a priest of Dionysus, suffering the same death as the god. His journey to the un derworld associated him with occult knowledge. The Orphic cult was a mystery wors hip that offered spiritual guidance along a path of self-purification and preparation of th e soul for life after death. Orphic teachings sought to awaken the divine spark of potential. Ini tiates consumed a meal of bread and wine (the body and blood of Dionysus), expecting to be etern ally united with the god in the next world. Orphism espoused reincarnation, and viewed Hades as the place of renewal and rebirth. His singing and lyre-playing, rivet any form of wildness, even the forces of the Netherworld. Eurydice symbolizes the hero's soul and is a part of his comp leted existence. The passion and the hero's absolute attachment to her, keep her prisoner in the levels of desire without an escape at upper levels where she belongs. Finally thr ough the snake bite in her leg, she manages to escape from earth and walks across to the Netherw orld. Orpheus, descends to Hades, inconsolable, in order to search for the part of h is self that he considers to be essential for his integration inside his incarnate natu re. He carries the lyre (his art), the Apollonian light of the soul in the darkness of his person al unconscious, enchanting even Persephone, giver of life and death. Nevertheless, his cons cious is pointed upwards, to the world where he belongs. And although Persephone has forbi dden it, Orpheus breaks his promise and because of his adulterated desire, look s at Eurydice and points his conscious to the Kingdoms of the unconscious. His first try w as a failure. The Gates are closed now. The chance comes only once. If you don't take advantage of it , it disappears. Orpheus retires in a cave (7 months) and tries to reorienta te his self in connection to the values of life. His passion to retrieve Eurydice is replaced by his passion to work. He establishes the Orphical Sacraments and teaches people about the cause of the things (th e cause of existence lies in the sound). He goes up to the high mountain of initiation ( Paggeo) in order to praise Apollo. But by turning his consciousness exclusively towards Eu rydice, he ignores"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"the expelled tensions. That which he should have brought in balance in side him, tears him totally apart by identifying him with Zagreas. This supreme sacrifice gives him immortality. The hero who takes the responsibility of serving the world, ought to shatter his consciousness and recompose it into a n ew universal realization of the world. Orpheus symbolizes the supreme balance of the soul between its Apollonian and Dionysian sight. He is a spiritual hero. He is the hard journe y of the spirit and its descent into the material. His mistakes though, are balanced by h is sacrifice and contribution. And spirit's shining lives in the Orphical Sacraments , in the magic of sound, in our need to sing and praise the divine existence within our self. The Orphic story also named the toys of the new ruler of the world. These toys b ecame symbols of those rites of initiation which were first undergone by the divine boy, the first Dionysus. Dice, ball, top, golden apples, bull-roarer and wool played a part in the ceremony of initiation or in the tale itself. This tale is now told only in the versi on adopted by the followers of Orpheus, who introduced the Titans into the story. There is , however, another version according to which it was not necessarily the Titans who behaved so cr uelly to the son of Zeus and Persephone, but simply \"earth-born beings\". It is known , however, that the Kouretes were included amongst such beings. It is also known that of the sons of the Great Mother the two older ones were always hostile to the third. The num ber of the Titans who murdered the first Dionysos is expressly stated as two. In the Orphic continuation of the story, the Kouretes were replaced, b y theTitans. It was told that they surprised the child-god as he was playing with the toys. Jealou s Hera had instigated this: it was she who on a previous occasion had sent the Kourete s against Epaphos, the Dionysos-like son of Zeus and the cow-shaped Io. The Titans had whitened their faces with chalk. They came like spirits of the dead from the Und erworld, to which Zeus had banished them. They attacked the playing boy, tore him into seven pie ces and threw these into a cauldron standing on a tripod. When the flesh was boile d, they began roasting it over the fire on seven spits. In another tale it seems that when Zeus smote the Titans with his li ghtning they had already eaten the flesh of Dionysos. They must have been hurled back into th e Underworld, since in the Orphic hymn they are invoked as the subterranean ancestors of mankind. But from the steam caused by the flash of lightning, which set them on fir e, was formed a sort of ash. The ash turned into that substance from which the followers of O rpheus taught that men were made. This teaching, however, is of much later date than the stor y of the sufferings of the horned child-god. The story was also told: The boiled limbs of the first Dionysos, the son of Dem eter, went into the earth. The earth-born beings had torn him to pieces and boiled h im, but Demeter gathered the limbs together. This may, however, be a story concerning the creat ion of the vine. We learnt from the followers of Orpheus that Dionysos's last gift was wine, and indeed he himself by then assumed the name Oinos, \"Wine\". It was Zeus w ho brought fulfillment, but it was Dionysos who completed the fulfillment or, t o use a modern expression, \"set the crown on the world's creation\". But this notion, to o, is of later date. In the original tale the boiled limbs of the god were burnt (with the except ion of a single limb), and we may presume that the vine arose from the ashes."},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"All tales spoke of this exception of one limb, which was devoured neither by the Titans nor by the fire nor by the earth. A goddess was present at the meal in later tales , the goddess Pallas Athene, and she hid the limb in a covered basket. Zeus took charge of it. I t was said to have been Dionysos's heart. This statement contains a pun. It is also said t hat Zeus entrusted the kradiaios Dionysos to the goddess Hipta, so that she might carry h er head. \"Hipta\" was a name in Asia Minor for the great mother Rhea. The phallic nature of Dionysus is revealed in the double meaning of the word Kradiaios. It can be derived from the kradia, \"heart\", and from the krade, \"fig-tree\", in which latter derivation it means an object made of fig-wood. The basket on Hipta's head was a liknon, a winnowing-fan, such as was carried on the head of festal processions and con tained a phallus under a pile of fruit, Dionysos himself having made the phallus of fig-wood. It also reported that the Liknites, \"he in the winnowing fan\", was repeatedl y \"awakened\" by the Thyiades, the women who served Dionysos on Mount Parnassus. Like the later story of Jesus, Dionysus is linked to salvation as far back as the archaic myths. Dionysus went down into Hades, the place of the dead, and brought hi s mother back to life. In Italy, in the third or fourth century BC, texts written on gold pl ates and buried with the dead, describe the souls of Dionysus followers in the afte rlife, drinking from one particular cool pool that will give them divinity and eternal life. Dionysus was celebrated in civic religion and in mysteries. The Mysteries of Dionysus included in itiation by bathing -- baptism, a sacred meal, a myth about the death and resurrection of the god, and s alvation. Dionysus was identified with the lamb, and called \"King of Kings,\" \"Onl y Begotten Son,\" \"Savior,\" \"Redeemer,\" \"Sin bearer,\" \"Anointed One,\" the \"Alpha and Om ega.\" As we have seen, gods do not always, if ever, appear singly. Often many gods inhabit or characterize an experience. They exist in a state of mutual interpenetrat ion termed, in psychology, contamination. Hades-Dionysus is a composite god, expressing charact eristics of both these principles. For convenience, we shall examine first one god , then the other, and finally the composite. Hades or Pluto is in certain respects the most potent archetypal princ iple in the planetary pantheon. It is the archetype of power itself, as it embodies the primord ial forces of destruction and regeneration, the chthonic underworld in every sense, the secretive and subversive, the shadow, the id, the broiling cauldron of the instincts, th e violent and the demonic, the fiery and volcanic, the elemental energies of nature. This dyn amic is Pluto- Hades-Dionysus in Greek mythic terms; in Indian terms, Kali and Shi va in both their destructive and regenerative aspects. Whatever Pluto comes into alignme nt with, it greatly intensifies and compels that second archetype, deepens and makes m ore profound, destroys and transforms. It brings a titanic, overwhelming elemental potency, on a mass s cale. HADES is a symbol of the incredible, fathomless depths of the psyche. Th e true nature of all things is hidden in these depths of the unconscious. We must pen etrate this depth dimension and discover what is hidden there. The Roman correspondent for Hades is Pluto, whose name means \"wealth.\" This indicates the buried treasur es existing in the depths of the psyche and experience of this realm of the underworld. We have an invisible connection to the underworld, which is Hades himself."},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"When Hades appears in the upperworld, he is frequently experienced a s a vile violence, as in the case of Persephone's rape (see Chapter VIII). Hades hides invi sibly in things. Death is always immanent. He required no cult worship from mortals, because he already possesses the riches of the depths of experience. The final act is always his, in any event. The final purpose of every soul involves \"devotion\" to Hades, in a psychic sense . Most experiences are attributed only a relative significance when they are re lated to the personal experience of death. Even in life, most people are obsessed with death. H ades is the unknowable goal underlying all human experience. To put events into the pe rspective we will have on our deathbeds shows the meaning for soul inherent in these e vents. DIONYSUS is the god of intoxication and madness, which can be a sort of \"death in life.\" Addicts, like vampires, are virtually the living dead. His is the cult of th e magical child, which is so influential in substance abuse recovery programs -- the i nner child. James Hillman has attributed to him \"the mystery of nursing and psychological re birth through the underworld depths.\" Dionysus has been corresponded with a bi-s exual consciousness. This is a god who is primordially united with his own femininity. Thi s \"royal marriage\" of the inner self is an already present possbility available to anyone. Through Dionysus, we experience soul in matter; the imaginal aspect of r eality, and the reality aspect of imaginal life. There is no mind-body split, here. There is no clear distinction between sanity and insanity. Dionysus' madness is character ized as ritualistic enthusiasm. This energized enthusiasm is abandonment of ego-conscious ness. Bisexuality here implies the internal mingling of male and female, active and passive , life and death. This does not come about through \"will\" but through acceptance. Dionysus maintains his undivided state by not being too analytical (Apolloni c). His style is to synthesize. He intimates a polytheistic approach to psychology which recogn izes and embraces many archetypal perspectives. When one invokes Dionysus, there i s personal experience of psychological polytheism. The archetype of the divine or miraculous child appears in advance of a trans formation in the psyche. It is a symbol of promise of the joyous renewal of life, the vision o f new beginnings, new possibilities, new attempts, the possibility of regen eration. In its negative form, it appears as the youth, male or female, who never grows up because emotion al development is stunted in adolescence. This retarded psychological dev elopment of the vegetative youth is called puer psychology. High-living Puer is identified with the child-god Iacchus -- here , god of fragmentation, or psychic dissociation, intoxication and renewal. Aimlessly travelling in and out of various groups, puer lives for amusement and sheer excitement, picking up fr iends when he wants and dropping them when they become in any sense a responsibility. For one pe rson this puer psychology is something that needs to be outgrown; for another it is the very means of development. Conceivably it may be both. PHYSICAL FORM:"},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"To begin to comprehend Dionysus, his ascent to Olympus and his descent i nto Hades, we must understand that he is the embodiment of 50,000 years of human shamanic spir ituality and techniques of inducing ecstasy. The shaman is a specialist in the s acred who succeeds in healing his own mental crisis bordering on madness, having mystical expe riences, expressed in ecstatic trance. This primitive religious ecstasy signi fies the soul's flight to heaven, or its wanderings on the earth, and its descent to the subterranean world, among the dead. Psychoactive plants and potions were among the technologies shaman s employed. The shaman is medicine man, priest and soul-guide. He is generally with t he spirits, retrieving lost souls, or guiding the dead. In fact, the body's abandonment by th e soul during ecstasy is equivalent to a temporary death. So, the shaman is one who can d ie, and then return to life, many times. He learns this technique through ini tiation -- how to orient himself in unknown regions, and explore new planes of existence. He knows how to find the gates to transcendence and hell. He knows what obstacles he will meet on the journey and how to overcome them. Dan Russell is an independent scholar whose recent book Shamanism and Drug Propaganda , traces the roots of the modern Drug War back to their ancient unconscious origins. Beginning with the evolution of Paleolithic proto-hominids, Rus sell presents one example after another in support of his thesis that the Drug War is a psychologi cal inheritance from ancient times, one which is now deeply embedded in and, in some cases, the driving force of our culture of technology, power and profits. Russell draws extensively from archeological evidence, presenting object after object engraved with archetypal symbols of shamanic travels, and he deconstructs coun tless ancient stories and myths to show that many of them alluded to visionary states elicited by the ingestion of psychoactive plants and potions. Russell, building on the w ork of John Allegro, even presents evidence that the Bible is riddled with cryp tic stories and word-play bestowing the importance of shamanic inebriation, such as the cannibis us ed in Hebrew anointing oil and temple incense. Over time, the stories told by ancient pe ople (culminating in the New Testament), have been co-opted, corrupted, and manipulated by f orces bent on producing a conformist culture. Modern industrial culture, argues Russell, is dependent upon the act ive eradication of the conscious knowledge of entheogens. As explained by Russell: The archet ypal frame of reference has been carefully manipulated, through succeeding histori cal stages, to destroy conscious, cultural, knowledge of the ancient shamanism. When conscious me mory (mnemosyne) is destroyed, what is left is emotion, irrational attitudes dictated by ‘parentally’ inculcated compulsions: God-the-Father as Pavlov. It’s not for nothing that the great shaman Plato said that all learning is remembering. The great crime of the nonconforming shaman is that he or she struggles to bring to consciousness that which the authorities, and their compulsive sheep, want forgotten. If a \"descent\" does not come in initiatory form, it often comes as a dis-ease or ordeal -- as what the Greeks called katabasis . The mark of descent, undertaken consciously or not, is a newly arrived-at lowliness, associated with water and soul, as height is assoc iated with spirit. \"Water prefers low places.\""},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"The lowliness happens particularly to men who are initially high, luc ky, elevated (Bly, 1990). One is no longer special, but fallen, degenerate. Depression comes with tragedy and a mean life of ordinariness, heaviness, silences, weightiness and soberne ss begins. Katabasis can appear without either addiction or ill health, and can be the root of suici de. The way down and out doesn't require poverty, homelessness, physical deprivation , but it requires a fall from status with emphasis on consciousness of the fall. Katabasis ca rries the whole concept of disaster, of tragedy; one sees one's own darkside, the dark side of those close to him, and they see yours. Long difficult repentance can be a way of descent, of admi tting powerlessness. The descent is a response to the something that wants u s there -- the Dark Queen. The medical model of addiction is a scientific theory with roots in parti cular social and political prejudices. Dionysus is seen in modern patterns of substanc e abuse and recovery programs. As Dionysus is the god of madness, he brings denial, anxiety, rationaliz ation, toxicity, and prejudice in his wake. It is easy for Dionysus to \"go with the fl ow.\" But it is difficult for individuals of this type to be commited, which includ es accepting discipline, recognizing limits, and being a responsible individual. The drug issue usually attracts our attention through media presentation s which seek to reduce the issue to a single, instantly comprehensible message but in t he process an inaccurate and largely false impression is created. Even among many drug worke rs and researchers, there is an avoidance of anything that smacks of theory, and a prefe rence for action, even if that action is based on nothing more than personal prejudice an d guesswork. Furthermore, stereotyped and inaccurate views of addiction are not uncom mon even within the ranks of those who work intimately with drug problems, whe re there is all too frequently a lack of coherence in terms of the work carried out, and an unwil lingness to consider alternative interpretations. Perhaps most of all, there is the belief that the ‘truth’ about the nature and causes of addiction can be revealed by methods which re ly principally on asking people to answer questions or express opinions about their own or other people’s drug use. However, answering questions and stating opinions are behaviours in their own right, which have dynamics all of their own. For these reasons, it is important to cons ider existing knowledge on the way people answer questions and explain their actions, s ince understanding these processes may yield fresh perspectives on the i ssue under investigation. The Myth of Addiction attempts to provide such an alternative perspective in the area of drug use and misuse. Whilst the ideas contained are not new, they re present a species of argument which is neglected, primarily because it is sligh tly more complicated than the more popular theories of drug use. The argument presented in The Myth of Addiction (Davies, Harwood, 1997) is basically that people take drugs because they want to, and because it makes sense for the m to do so given the choices available, rather than because they are compelled to by the p harmacology of the drugs they take. Nonetheless, we generally prefer to conceptualise ou r drug abusers in terms which imply that their behaviour is not their own to control."},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"This picture of learned helplessness arises because it is the pic ture we want to have, and the view is supported by a body of data consisting largely of people’s self report s, opinions and statements of belief. This body of data, while potentially of great value in ce rtain respects, is frequently put to uses for which it is ill suited; it does not always m ean what we think it means. It is functional for drug users to report that they are addicted, for ced into theft, harassed by stressful life events, and driven into drug use by forces beyon d their capacity to control. The central argument of this book is that such self reports have their o wn internal functional logic which is independent of reality, and that other resea rch methods and forms of analysis would consequently produce a different picture. Further more, the fact that the explanations people provide for their behaviour make some reference to the ir own motives and intentions is hardly new; it is a central feature of social interact ion, and not specific to drug users. The standard line taken by a majority of people in the media, in treatment age ncies, in government and elsewhere, hinges around notions of the helpless addict wh o has no power over his/her behaviour; and the evil Underground pusher lurking on stre et corners, trying to ensnare the nation’s youth. They are joined together in a deadly game by a variety of pharmacologically active substances whose addictive powers are so great that to tr y them is to become addicted almost at once. Thereafter, life becomes a nightmare of withdrawal symptoms, involuntary th eft, and a compulsive need for drugs which cannot be controlled. In fact, not one of the se things is, or rather needs to be true. Availability is probably a major determinant of the extent of drug use. The precise form taken by drug problems within any given society is de termined in large part by that society’s response to the problem. The final message is that dealing with drug problems effectively depe nds on giving back to people the sense of personal power and volition which they require if th ey are to control their drug use for themselves, a power which existing concepts of ‘addict ion’ frequently seek to limit or deny at the outset as a precondition to further treatment . To take this apparently simple step, however, involves a major rethinking of contemporary moral attitudes to drugs and addiction, since these shape the nature of the help that we are prepared to offer. In the meantime, the existing system does not work; \"r etreads\" in rehab programs are a truism. There is little indication that any program at the moment does better than spontaneous recovery (that is, giving up all by yourself); and some evidence that punitive legislative interventions make things worse by institut ionalising the type of harmful drug use that we most wish to avoid. Hades-Dionysus was described by Heraclitus in Fragment 15: If it were not in honor of Dionysus that they conducted the procession and sang the hymn to the male organ, their activity would be completely shameless."},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"Hades and Dionysus are the same, no matter how much they go mad and rave celebrating bacchic rites in honour of the latter. This reveals how sexual fantasies connect the perspective of vitality wi th the perspective of the psychic depths. Events have meaning for both life and soul. Hades-Dionys us is easily seen in the irrationality in and about patterns of addiction. The earliest explanations for addictions and the madness of alcoholism included the assertion that the individual was possessed by the devil, or satanic forces. Mentioned repeatedly in the ps ychological profile of potential and active abusers are the following characteristic traits: 1). High level of anxiety in interpersonal relationships. 2). Emotional immaturity (Dionysian puer or eternal adolescent). 3). Ambivalence or hostility toward authority. Passive Agressive. 4). Low frustration tolerance. 5). Grandiosity. 6). Low self-esteem. 7). Feelings of isolation, alienation. 8). Perfectionism (a form of self-punishment). 9). Shame and Guilt (feeling either sub- or superhuman, rather than hum an). 10). Compulsiveness. These traits can range in degree from the impulsive personality to the soc iopath or psychopath, who is unable to experience guilt or responsibility for hi s/her behavior. The Dionysian personality is apprehensive because he can never determine w hen he will become possessed by the archetypal compulsion and be carried away into revelry and exc ess. The tragic consequences of alcoholism and heroin addiction are well-known . The making of wine, and the imbibing of poppy juices or sap was known to the Cretans of the Late Minoan period, and survives as a \"drug cult\" in our modern world, with its own h allowed grounds and shrines. Most drug use is highly ritualized and repetitive. It is linked to environmental and psychobiological cues -- set and setting. Stages of substance abuse can be classified as follows: 0). abstinence 1). initiation of use 2). continuation (susceptibility increases with each new exposure) 3). transition (the change from use to abuse produces shame and disgust, inc reasing anxiety) 4). cessation means either satiety or abstinence. This requires fun damental resharing of the personality and self image; not substitution of one addictive relationsh ip for another 5). relapse, or reversal The substance of addiction can include those not commonly thought of in s uch a way, such as interpersonal relationships (codependence) and even pets. Othe r common abuses include: alcohol, nicotine, ecstasy, THC, amphetamines, cocaine, narcotic s, barbiturates, caffeine, masturbation, gambling, food and psychedelics. Mushrooms, while r elatively"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"harmless, are traditionally associated with the underworld, and have bee n called the souls of the dead, and \"sons of the Gods.\" There is a plethora of theories describing the origins of addiction patte rns, including a life- theme theory of chronic drug abuse, which provides the primary narrati ve thread of a life. Runaway drug use is generally acknowledged as a spiritual emergency. Among th e most plausible other theories are the following: 1). personality deficiency 2). social influence 3). addiction-to-pleasure 4). disruptive environment 5). metabolic deficiency 6). bad-habit theory 7). drug subculture theory 8). ego-self theory 9). coping theory 10). achievement anxiety 11). neurobiological (the medical illness model) It is likely that many of the above influences play an important part in any parti cular case. The \"Life Theme Theory\" takes into account the spiritual dimension of the experience. The characteristic lifetheme lies deeper in the psyche than the ego and l ifestyle of an individual and conditions them. It is the core conflict of the person, that the poi son is the cure, and in fact, the individual seems preprogrammed or predisposed to this compu lsive behavior. The myth manifests in life as an uncontrollable repetition compulsion , altering the limbic system. It may seem like a strange way for the psyche to insure the wholeness of a person, but it is a survival reality for some. Drug induced states vary widely, but in general are means of artificially i nducing contraction or expansion of the ego. Amphetamines appeal to unreflective act ion-oriented types; narcotics abusers typically try to withdraw from the problems of lif e rather than conquer them. Barbiturate users seek a ticket to oblivion where they can release their tension in aggresive behavior or accidents with no ensuing sense of guilt. The 70s and 80s epidemic use of cocaine created exceptions to the older person ality profiles. Many were normally considered high achievers, but subject to c rises of alienation and feelings of despair and emptiness, combined with a pursuit o f pleasure and escapism. The powerful stimulus of cocaine provided a potent, if temporary release from the pressures and problems of modern, copetetive. It provides the illusion of sparkling brilliance, and provides many with a surrogate love-affair or romance with th e white demon lady. Spotts and Shontz (1981) described this personality in their Life-Them e Theory: \" The cocaine users we studied seemed to have progressed further along the developmen tal path than men in the other groups. Most described early lives characterized by a rat her high level of positive family feeling. Most described their mothers as warm and their fat hers as strong and encouraging. As adults, cocaine users are ambitious, intensely competeti ve men who work"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"hard to become successful. They like to take risks and live by their wits. The y have stronger and more resilient egos than men in the other drug-user groups. They display a m ore intense commitment and willingness to struggle to overcome their environmen t but are highly prone to symptoms of alienation from the psyche. They think of themselves as self -directed and self- sufficient, competent people--proud, energetic men who live life to the fu ll and are capable of carrying pleasure to its extreme. The key to understanding the cocaine users we studied is their intense counter-dependency, their need to be completely self-su fficient...They take cocaine to expand their egos and their self-confidence. In addition, they report that the drug produces temporary psychological states that are so ecstatic that life and fulfi llment seem complete, if only for a moment. Clearly this is merely a segment of today's drug-consuming public. All s eek to alter the limbic system to produce euphorias of different types and duration. The i ntermingling of Hades-Dionysus shows in cocaine addiction by also stimulating the user' s sexual fantasies. This is, in fact, many user's primary interest in the drug; it acts as an ap hrodisiac. Fantasies of bisexuality occur in those who might never experience them ot herwise; fetishes may emerge such as transvestite cross-dressing. In confusions of mascu line and feminine aspects there is no psychological fusion of the magical and religious powers of both sexes. Instead there is an inclination toward, if not overt \"acting out\" of sexual rel ations with members of both sexes -- taking the symbolic and metaphorical literally, and u sing it to moodalter and transgress boundaries. Positively, Dionysus is creativity in the inspired, almost intoxicated sen se, in which unconsciousness wells up. Identifying brings divine punishmen t as one suffers the fate of the God. When our ego takes credit for the creative flow, it brings dismem berment. Creativity is safe if one is uncomfortable and great effort is necessary. The rebirth aspect of the Dionysian cycle is revealed in the process of recovery from chemical addiction. John Bradshaw wrote the classics on this topic, including Bradshaw on the Family, Healing the Shame that Binds You , Homecoming, and Creating Love . There are also many excellent books for spouses of addicts and alcoholics which deal with issues sur rounding codependency, such as those by Melody Beattie. In substance abuse recovery programs, healing often comes through giving posi tive attention to the wounded and disenfranchised Inner Child, and giving up also the addiction to \"acting-out,\" dramatics and hystrionics, the emotional roller-coaster. Re covery means reclaiming and championing the lost or disowned Inner Child and healing t he toxic shame and low self-esteem that binds one to the addictive pattern, keepin g one essentially a prisoner in a dark cave, metaphorically speaking. We must learn to give up control and enmeshment, love ourselves, reframe mistakes and self-criticism , and find support and validation in positive ways that don't lead to self-destructive or self-de feating patterns. This develops awareness and changes our self-image. To do this we must grieve our original pain, reown our disowned parts, move th rough our fears and allow ourselves to feel again, rather than bury the problems. We have t o get in touch with how depressed and angry we really are, and feel that unresolved grief. It also means connecting in a way that is positive for the whole person with Higher Power, a transformative vision, one's own form of spiritual awakening or rebirth, and f inding bliss in non-attachment.

This was reflected in the Dionysian c ult through the counterparts of tragedy and comedy. This is a positive outlet for the drama tic nature which possesses us in the throes of addictive patterns. The compuls ion is channeled into a katharsis which is is expressed in the healing power of arts. Today, we have in the therapeutic arts the practice of psychodrama to resolve emotional proble ms through role- playing. These artforms grew out of Greek culture as the natural result of their b elief that excessive action in a given direction results in spontaneous transformation into its opposite. Drama embodied tension, while comedy was free and unrestrained. Tragedy emerg ed from the improvisations of poets, while comedy was born in phallic dances and songs. Whe n comedy flows spontaneously from the comedian, he is moved to push into an expl oration of the Unknown. You can pretend to be serious, but not funny. The Greeks certainly didn't appproach their theatre as entertainme nt, as we do today. Plays were state-wide religious festivals, open to the entire populati on. Drama was a concerted effort designed to elevate the consciousness of the whole c ommunity. It was an imaginative enactment fusing theatre, religion, politics, and psychodram a. Actors were regarded as interpreters of the gods. In their emotion-intoxicated scen es, they could move the entire audience into an enraptured empathy. Theatre amplified the interactions of gods and men, and the hero with t he tragic flaw or comedic underbelly. They were embodied in a multisensory mode, illus trating familiar stories and mythic themes. The plays provided a safe ritualistic learnin g environment where particpants could cathart their emotions. One primary purpose of p lay is as a learning experience. Tragic drama provides an 'early warning system' extend ing personal experience. It is way of facing finiteness without neurotic repres sion, of losing one's life in imagination to retain it in reallity, a way of studying the consequences of moral choices in dramatic simulation. Then when the real crisis comes we are somewhat innured, and can reach down for the emotional resilience and moral courage demanded by lif e. The structure of Greek tragedy is inherent in the dual aspects of Dion ysus. He is god of wine, joy and plenitude and symbolizes the lush harvest of the vines. But h e is also the god of compassion as well as emotional excess, torn to pieces by the Titans, and symb olized by the pruned and twisted stumps of the wintering vine. Repeatedly tr agic dramas show this cycle of the seasons. The necessary cycling interaction of joy and sorrow. According to Ralph Metzger ( Maps of the Mind , \"Grapes Grown from the Twisted Stump: Dionysus, Drama and Democracy\"), even if the Greeks believed in a rhythmic universe of contrasting joys and pains, they also deplored excess, as the failure to realize that every pride must ebb and anger subside. Hence disaster results from break ing the principle of sophrosyne , 'nothing to excess'. The finest human ideals, honed to god-like perfect ion, swing to and fro, in dynamic opposition. It was a frightening existential visi on, which the Greeks used drama to exaggerate."},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"It is easier to teach by negative example that every situation requires th e rock of Apollo, the whirlpool of the Furies, and the justice of Athena to mediate betwe en them. Error can be universally dramatized. Virtue requires each person to steer betw een intellect and impulse. Human folly is thus less a consequence of badness in people or val ues than of misjudgement in combining values. The tragic hero triumphs, over-learn s the winning value combination, and employs it in new circumstances with disasterou s results. Such insights give Greek tragedy its compassion and emotional range. In each case a s ingle element in the value system grows 'cancerously' to kill the whole. We hate th e crime but not the perpetrators. Another function of Greek tragedy was the presentation of anomalies that cal led forth a creative response. Disintegration must precede reintegration and only the greatest resilience in the face of anxiety can achieve this. If we accept that highe r levels of moral awareness are born out of a frustrating dialectical clash between opposed mo ral positions, each inadequate to the dilemma presented, then the presentation of trage dy makes brilliant sense. Essentially tragedy imposes a Dionysian/Christ-like 'crucifixi on' between polar ideals upon an entire audience. But tragedy doesn't necessarily spell unmitigated misery. The princip le of peripeteia works here too, as the trough of tragedy yields to a wave of elation -- and the story covers the entire emotional spectrum. If the Greeks depicted disintegration on the stage, this had the effect of fostering reintegration around the stage as thousands wept as one . These great waves of intoxicating emotion, accompanied by clasping and weeping in one anothe r's arms affirmed the vitality of the moment, the infinite preciousness of hum an lives, poised on the edge of an abyss. For the joys of life are found in its constrast and closeness wit h death, as embodied in Hades Dionysus, patron of this theatrical art. Attachments ar e strengthened in beholding abandonement. It takes genius, surely, to encounter imaginary death in a way that celebrates real life. A psychological experiment by Leonard Berkowitz suggests the effects of tr agic drama. Two groups were shown an identical exerpt from a violent film. The first group were provided with a story context that justified the punishment passed on th e protagonist. The second group witnessed grave injustice to a tragic hero. When members of b oth groups were subsequently invited to punish an incompetent assistant, the witnesses to tragedy were three times less punitive than the rejoicers in righteous wrath. Trage dy gentles, then. Few wish to add one iota to human pain. Rather, they feel drawn, participatively and democratically, into an unjust scene to set it right. Greek drama and democracy, viewed as wholes, were celebrations of harmonia (harmony) and symphronasis (reconciliation and symphony), terms employed by the mathematician and democratic theorist Pythagoras. Harmony was not some persistent harpin g on a single mean, but the play of the instrument around the mean. Similarly Greek tr agedy shows scant respect for the equable temperaments. The ideal is both the att ainment of heroic extremes and the realization that harmony requires one extreme to yield to i ts opposite (in the rhythm of verse, plot and music). What is heroic about Oedipus is his anagnorisis , his painful change from ignorance to knowledge based on Orphic rites of init iation and purification. He had accepted and learned from the extremities of hum an experience, freedom-determinism, vigilance-blindness, sovereignty-exile."},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"It remained for Anagoras, teacher of Pericles and Socrates, to propose that mind pervaded a patterned universe, wherein every value contained the seeds of its oppos ite, where democratic debate, like threatre, staged conflict in order to contain it.

Its difficult to find ecstasy in life without running into the risk s of addictive patterns. When it comes to compulsive behavior, we know how we should behave, but we do what we want usually based on how we feel. Imaginal psychology holds a radically different view of Dionysus than the medically-based model of recovery, and sees purpose and value in addiction's inner dynamics, including depression and feminization . It sees the symptom as poison and cure are the same, in the alchemical sense -- the nursing and de epening are contained within the problem, rather than coming from outside it. The god I S the symptom; pathologizing is a form of soul-making. There are several forms of psychophysical and psychosexual intoxication, depe nding on what level of experience we consider. There is intoxication with physic al beauty and strength, intellectual achievement, position in life, learning, virtue, good ness, power and authority, and even intoxication with detachment from the world. On the me ntal level, Dionysus can be associated with the tendency to psychological fragmentation, p sychological femininity, bisexuality and hysteria, according to Imaginal Psychologist, James H illman ( The Myth of Analysis ). Hillman suggests that \"Dionysus is mainly a god of women. Though he is male and ph allic, there is no misogyny in this structure of consciousness because it is not divided from its own femininity. The change that is indicated by Dionysus is one where fe male is not added to or integrated by male; rather, the image shows an androgynous consciousness, w here male and female are primordially united.\" The mytheme of Dionysus not only concerns this archetypal bisexuality, but als o reflects the magickal image of Tiphareth (from the Qabalistic Tree of Life), the Divine Child. \"Dionysus as child refers to a view of reality which is not divided. This per spective would not exclude the child for the sake of maturity, since the child is the synthesis itself.\""},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"Tiphareth is the sphere of the Heart Center, and its archetypal images include the sacrificed god and the magical child. They are a key to heart-level initiation . In the Dionysian worldview \"affliction would not be divided from it s own potential of nursing, which is constellated by the suffering and childishnes s.\" This nursing often appears in real life as the codependent caregiver of the addicted indivi dual -- the rescuer, who gives 'the milk of human kindness' till it hurts. \"The torn and ren dered suffering is not healed by the medicine of Apollo, but becomes an initiation into the c osmos of Dionysus.\" Dionysus reflects the plurality of the self in his fragmentation and i s thus the archetype of a polytheistic approach to life, which sees the dynamics of many god/goddess es in constant interaction. This polytheistic magical child seems reminiscent of Freud's \"polymorphously perverse child,\" with its strong desires for power and wish-fulfi llment. He joins disparate elements. Hillman points out that, \"Dionysus is Zeus-son, the renewal of the High God through his most physical and yet psychological son, at the center of whose cult f rom the earliest times is the child, the mystery of nursing, and of psychological r ebirth through underworld depths.\" His paradoxical qualities show that \"compulsion and inhibition belong t ogether. In Dionysus, borders join that which we usually believe to be separated by bord ers. We cannot tell whether he is mad or sane, wild or somber, sexual or psychic, male or female, conscious or unconscious; the 'border' is manifested. ...ZOE is another w ay of speaking of this ambivalence. The force of life, like the child, needs nursing. The Dionysian experience transforms women not into raving hysterics and rebels but into nurses.\" \"The central meaning of Dionysus is his relationship to the underworld of soul: Dionysus, Lord of Souls. 'Horror' is for the sake of soul, whose subconscious dominants (underworld lords) are Hades, Dionysus, and Persephone.\" Hillman stresses that \"a Dionysian ego must express bisexuality. ...His dism emberment is the fragments of consciousness strewn through all of life, through every eroge nous zone and plexus of our physical bodies. In him the bisexual pair are united...Bise xuality combines not only male and female; it also brings together life and death. One aspect of life is riven so that another aspect -- the psychic and called \"death\" -- can r each awareness. Life can only be understood in terms of the soul's one certainty: death. A pproximation to the hermaphrodite is a death experience; the movement into death proc eeds through bisexuality. Death and bisexual consciousness are what Dionysus involves. Di onysus represents a radical shift of consciousnesss where...another conscious ness would enter into us as we approaximate our own bisexuality.\" Dionysian consciousness may be characterized as follows: \"We would have t he experience of passivity and an inability to proceed very far against nature. We would be aware of a fundamental defect and lacuna in our consciousness and of a dependency u pon something else, out of which it comes. This lacuna of the feminine void is not to be overc ome, fulfilled, completed. Rather the emptiness is the completion, so that this lacu na becomes the place of reflection, the place of psychic awareness, and offers the space of carryin g and containing; it is psyche itself. Our consciousness would provide the blood of nour ishment; and be able"},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"to feed itself from what processes it generates within its own imaginal matrix. Consciousness would no longer be only a male aura seminalis, instigator and pr opagator.\" \"The reddening spoken of in alchemy, and the self-feeding by means of th e pelican, would thus be indicated. Gives the experience of infoldedness and interi ority, things not coming to final fruition in exteriorized forms. Its movement is slower, sadder , cooler, incorporating left-handedness in its symbolic senses. We would be aware that somethi ng driving is missing, a basic inoperancy of phallic compulsion.\" \"With the return of passivity to consciousness, the inertia of depression s and the helplessness of suffering would take on another quality...belonging to consci ousness, being part of its composition, not afflictions coming to it unconciously, making it unc onscious, dragging it down and away. Depression is then no longer a sign of inferiority to be felt as defeat. Movement of the Dionysian libido comes and goes. The ego cannot control thes e movements. Heroic consciousness has an upward path and places a negative s ign upon digressions and descents. The libido descends for refuge when dri ven by excessive demands of the ruling will.\" \"Dionysus is a god of moisture and the descent is for moistening. Depres sion into these depths is not experienced as a defeat (since Dionysus is not a hero), but as downwardness, darkening, and becoming water (i.e. the alchemical solutio). The movements of libido are mythical events in which we participate, and as such they are objective. Whe n the ego forgets this and takes the vanishing personally, it makes depression by id entifying with the God. When Dionysus appears there is revel and celebration; his disappearan ce is a winter of discontent. Connecting the flux of libido to an archetypal dominant gives d epression a religious aspect; a crisis of mood, energy and also belief...the movements are res pected as natural and necessary to the libido itself.\" \"This is a body-consciousness, giving a somatized awareness of self in conc rete, actual behavior. Transforms that old frustration of reflection divided from action , where consciousness is conceived mainly in terms of speech and mind, giving over t he unconscious to the body and its \"acting out.\" Body is no longer the realm only of abyss and passion; it might now fill up with slowness and interiority. Hysteria somatizes consciousness. Psychic events become body events; meanings enter behavior. Hysterical reactions ar e attempts to refind nature, a prodromal bisexuality showing the feminine need for in itiation into body, life, and love in Dionysian terms.\" Psychotherapy reaches its ultimate goal in the wholeness of the conjunc tion of masculine and feminine, in the bisexuality of consciousness. Bisexuality, that incar nation of durable weakness and unheroic strength is found in the archetypal image of Dionysu s. \"Bisexual consciousness here means also the experience of psyche in all matte r, the fantasy in everything literal, and the literal too, as fantasy; it means a world undivided i nto spirit and matter, imaginal and real, body and consciousness, mad and insane.

This links him with Trump XX, THE AEON, which corresponds with the element fire in Qabala. As Zeus'-son, he is linked with the ligh t of Zeus and the phenomenon of 'lighting up', and he was a torchbearer in the Eleusinian M ysteries. Lucian stated that \"Fire is a Dionysian weapon.\" The torch-bearing ceremony open ed that movement of the Mysteries where the Divine Child was born in the un derworld."},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"Paradoxically, Dionysus is the god of all natural fluids, including wine, mil k, sap, honey and blood. He is also the indestructible life principle. These combi ne in rain which nurtures plant life and blood (which combines fire and water) which nurtures animal life, and humor which nourishes psychic life. Imagine life without jokes, irony an d humor! Humor, or comedy, keeps us from becoming 'too dry.' In ancient times, comedies w ere performed only once to preserve the element of surprise in the festivities. Di onysus is son of Zeus -- recall how rain frequently follows an impressive display of lightning and thunder in a cloudburst. Dionysus combines superabundant life energy with death- dealing power. He is insane with enthusiasm, and communicates this to his devotees in hi s epiphany. Dionysus is not only a god of literal intoxication by mead, wine, or opium (which t he Minoans resorted to when their \"vision\" failed). Mystics and visionaries speak of a spiritual intoxication experienced by the saints of various cultures. Th eir sufferings and ecstasies are related through the theme of the \"dying and resurrecting god.\" There is a spiritual identity between Osiris, Dionysus and Christ -- for all su ffered, were torn apart, and resurrected. Hillman tells us that \"Dismemberment becomes a way of discovering the puer spirit, for 'Dionysus, youngest of the gods' belongs to the theme of the renewal of the aging god . ...dismemberment refers to a psychological process that requires a body met aphor. The process of division is presented as a body experience, even as a horrifying tort ure. If, however, dismemberment is ruled by the archetypal dominant of Dionysus, t hen the process, while beheading or dissolving the central control of the old king, may b e at the same time activating the pneuma that is distributed throughout the mat erializations of our complexes. The background of Dionysus offers insight into the rending p ain of self-division, especially as a body-experience.\" \"Dionysus was called Lysios, the loosener. The word is cognate with lysis, t he last syllable of analysis. Lysis means loosening, setting free, deliverance, dissolution, coll apse, breaking bonds and laws, the final unravelling as of a plot.\" Thus, the mystical Dionysus is corresponded with the alchemical operat ion of solutio, which implies liquefication and dissolution. When a one-sided attit ude encounters a more comprehensive viewpont, the old attitude dissolves. Solutio is the diss olution of the old attitude and may be experienced as a threat to the worldview of the ego. The ego is interested in maintaining control. It tends to assume that it knows ho w to build personality from its perception of order. To this end, the ego embraces a paradigm or overvie w. Exposure to someone with a convincting and more comprehensive worldview can wash away the solid ground from under the ego's feet. This is not always welcome news, even though it may be an improvement over previous attitudes. The solid bottom was hes away and one feels adrift, before the new contents are assimilated into the co nscious attitude. The unified state or Self is the agent of solutio in alchemy -- it introduc es the mystery or irrational factor. Its long-range goal is the unification of the opposites. Both t he archetypal masculine and feminine elements are being dissolved and united at th e same time. Solutio is experienced by each as annihilation of itself. Later, it leadss to rej uvination in a new form. A large ego will be dissolved by its own excess. This dissolution leads the w ay to"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"rejuvination with a sounder basis. Uniting the wild life-force with devotion in love can dissolve many problems or blockages to further transformation. Internally, the unconscious or higher Self can dissolve the ego. Externall y an individual with a larger conscious understanding and wisdom than one's own can brin g about solutio. The best qualities of the individual ego survive. Aspects of the ego whic h consciously relate to the Self withstand solutio. Its major characteristics are: 1. return to the primal state 2. dissolution, dispersal, and dismemberment 3. containment of a lesser thing by a greater 4. rebirth, rejuvination, immersion in the creative energy flow 5. purification ordeal 6. solution of problems 7. melting or softening process (dissolving). The alchemist, cooperating intentionally with this transpersonal proce ss, then experiences the diminishment by solutio as a precursor to union with the Self. The worship of Dionysus in antiquity was intensely mystical, and caused p eople to suddenly abandon the social routine for participation in an emotionally ecstatic r eligious practice. To harmonize this dichotomy, the Greeks instituted the practice of wors hipping both Dionysus and Apollo at Delphi. \"Thus to combine the realms of the careful god of law and order and of the mystical god of license and abandon was one of the most startling exampl es of Greek genius for adjustment.\" The temple of Dionysus at Delphi was a theatre. Like Christ, Dionysus had a mortal mother who became deified, Semele, an d was characterized by incessant 'persecution,' which dramatized the r esistance against the god's mode of being and his religious message, because it threatened an entire li festyle and universe of values, symbolized by Olympian religion. As humans, we experience resistance to every absolute religious experience, because these are realized only b y denying eveything else, including equilibrium, perosnality, reason, consciousness, etc. Di onysus, like Christ, descends into Hades or death and brings a religious revelation. The Dionysian ecstasy means, above all, surpassing the human condition, the dis covery of total deliverance, obtaining a freedom and spontaneity inaccessible to human beings. That among these freedoms there also figured deliverance from prohibitions , rules and conventions of an ethical and social order appears to be certain. This explains, i n part, the mass adherence of women. But the Dionysiac experiences touched the dee pest levels. What distinguished this cult is not these psychopathic crises but the f act that they were valorized as religious experience, whether as a punishment or as a favor from the god. What separates a shaman from a psychopath is that he succeeds in curing himse lf of his transformational madness and ends by possessing a stronger and more creati ve personality than the rest of the community. At the center of the Dionysiac ritual, we always find, in one form or another, an ecstatic experience of more or less violent frenzy: mani a. This \"madness\" or manic state was in a way the proof that the initiate was entheos , 'filled with the god.'"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"The experience was certainly unforgetable, for there was a sharing in the cr eative spontaneity and intoxicating freedom, in the super-human force and invulne rability of Dionysus. Communion with the god shattered the human condition for a time, bu t it did not succeed in transmuting it. We can see the god run rampant in Bipolar Di sorder. This potent energy can be channeled and the number of famous bipolar creative mu sicans, writers and artists is staggering. The occultation and epiphany of Dionysus, his descents to Hades (comparab le to a death followed by a resurrection), and, above all, the cult of the infant Dionysus, w ith rites celebrating his \"awakening\" -- indicate the will, and the hope for a spi ritual renewal. Everywhere in the world the infant is charged with an initiatory symboli sm revealing the mystical rebirth. More than any other Greek gods, Dionysus astonishes by th e multiplicity and novelty of his epiphanies, by the variety of his transformations. He is always in motion; he makes his way everywhere ready to associate himself with various divinities. Intoxication, eroticism, universal fertility and also unf orgetable experiences are inspired by the periodic arrival of mania, the presence of death, immersion in animal unconsciousness, or by the ecstasy of enthousiasmos . All these terrors and revelations spring from a single source: the presence of the god. His mode of b eing expresses the paradoxical unity of life and death. This is why Dionysus cons titutes a type of divinity radically different from the Olympians, (Eliade, History of Religious Ideas ). In the Hellenistic and Roman period the most popular Greek god was Dionysu s. His public cult was \"purified\" and spiritualized by the elimination of ecstasy ( which, however, continued to play a part in the Dionysiac Mysteries). It is the most lively, vivi d mythology. Dionysus is a godman, mortal yet divine, persecuted yet victorious, murdere d yet resuscitated. In some versions of story, Dionysus brough Ariadne back from Hades and married her. She symbolized the human soul and Dionysus therefore de livered the soul from death, uniting with it in a mystical marriage, elevating her. The central act of the initiation was the divine presence made percep tible by music and dance, and experience that engendered belief in an intimate bond establ ished with the god. The showing of the phallus was a religious act, for the generative organ of Di onysus symbolized how the godman had conquered death. The Indian version of the the me is the sacrality of Shiva's lingam. The infant, as sign of rebirth and renewal, cont inues the religious symbolism of the phallus. To reiterate the relationship of Hades-Dionysus to the Trump XX, T he Aeon, recall that Hestia (fire) gave up her throne on Olympus when this new god arrived on the s cene. The Orphics considered Dionysus as the king of the new age. This myth seems s till alive in our eclectic culture with its New Age concerns and the visibility of t he holistic movement. Hopes attached to the triumph of Dionysus and the periodical regeneration of the world, imply belief in an imminent return to the Golden Age. Judgement/Aeon is also linked with the planetary power of Pluto. It too symb olizes an awakening to something you had not seen before. A paradigm shift calling for n ew perceptions. Rebirth.

In Orphic theology, the cosmology is conceived as a self-sacrifice of the divinity, the dis persal of the One in the Many, followed by \"resurrection\" or a return of multiplic ity into primordial Unity. The mutual identification of all gods ends in a \"monotheism\" of the s yncretistic type dear to the theosophers of late antiquity.

Th e scent of cinammon does little to alay the sense of terror and mystery. We tremble i n fear and anticipation of dismemberment, or human human sacrifice, at least on the ego-level. Both masters of death and intoxication's grip are here -- their imagees merge d in one terrifying figure. One is inaccessable in mortal form, but the other is all to easily bot ainable in many forms of substance abuse. Hades is likened to a black ram, and associated with the cypress and narcissus. Dionysus came from the east in the train of the Great M other, Cybele, who"},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"taught him most of his rites of ecstatic abandon. He is either seen as ma ture, bearded, and ivy-crowned or as a beardless effeminate youth with curly hair which hangs long and loose. This form wears a panther or fawn skin.

Appr oach this dual form through fear and trembling or intoxication -- with wine and strange drugs. Do you eve feel like you're \"falling apart,\" or \"coming apart at the seams,\" or \"can' t get it together\"? At those time we live the myth of Dionysus, the god who continu ally falls apart in dissolution, then gets it all back together again, until the next time. Dissolution means the breaking into parts, disintegration, death, being dissolved from a stable ego perspective. To be dissolute implies debauched, immortal behavior when life energi es are dissipated wastefully, also from the perspective of an ego trying to cope with the daily de mands of outer life. What was the worst tragedy you've experienced in your life? Have your resolved this i ssue in your present or does it still haunt you? Are you still limited by its sub sequent effect? Do you have Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome? Perhaps Dionysus can shed some light on the archetypal meaning of the event, its meaning for soul. We might also seek the m eaning in every event that it holds in terms of our immenent death, as well as its me aning to soul. Through the power of Dionysus we can connect with the meaning of our suf fering, and even come to see the comic irony in our most unpleasant circumstances . Have you ever been a victim of substance abuse or a codependent? Dionysus is cert ainly at work here, and this is why addictions and alcoholism may be rightly consid ered diseases, or psychobiological complexes, not character disorders. Of course, we have some hu man will power and should exert it against destabilizing influences. yet, when we are possessed by the god, we are essentially helpless before this poweful figure who wr enches us into the underworld, who seizes us and drags us down into the seemy side of lif e. Sober or intoxicated, a dialogue with Dionysus may inform us that behind the urge to i ntoxication lies another drive -- a spiritual need -- a desire for rebirth and new p otential. Jung counseled \"William\" the co-founder of A.A. a year before he institu ted the widely used 12-step recovery program. Jung wrote that \"alcoholism was the result of a h ungering for wholeness on a low level. This means that underneath the craving for alcoh ol is the urge to individuation, but it is all so unconscious that the urge to wholeness t akes the form of compulsive drinking. That being the case, one can see why the alcoholic refuses to give up his drink ing -- for it amounts to a \"religion\". It has as much grip on him/her as the individuation proc ess itself. The person is as bound to the drug of choice as to the cross of his own self-de velopment. For the abuser to give up the demon substances that has possessed him, he m ust find the greater spirit manifested in the urge to wholeness. As Jung put it in h is letter, only one spirit can ddrive out another. The program of A.A. has been so successful wi th so many precisely because it does offer a spiritual orientation, and puts its mem ber on the path to individuation. The same may be said for Al-Anon and co-dependents, who mu st give up the false need for controlling others."},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"Maybe you are involved in some form of dramatic expression, as a writer or performer.

CRONOS The End of Time The Next Revolution in Physics JULIAN BARBOUR A revolutionary new theory that attacks one of the foundation stones of science--the existence of time Richard Feynman once quipped that \"Time is what hap pens when nothing else does.\" But Julian Barbour disagrees: i f nothing happened, if nothing changed, then time would stop. For time is nothing but change. It is change that we perceive o ccurring all around us, not time. Put simply, time does not exis t. In this highly provocative volume, Barbour presents the basic evidence for a timeless universe, and shows why we still experience the world as intensely temporal. It is a book that strikes at the heart of modern physics. It casts doubt on Einstein's gre atest contribution, the spacetime continuum, but also points to the sol ution of one of the great paradoxes of modern science, the chasm betwee n classical and quantum physics. Indeed, Barbour argues that th e holy grail of physicists--the unification of Einstein's general r elativity with quantum mechanics--may well spell the end of time. Barbour writes with remarkable clarity as he ranges from the ancient philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides, thr ough the giants of science Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, to the wo rk of the contemporary physicists John Wheeler, Roger Penrose , and Steven"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"Hawking. Along the way he treats us to enticing gli mpses of some of the mysteries of the universe, and presents intr iguing ideas about multiple worlds, time travel, immortality, and, abo ve all, the illusion of motion.

Juli an Barbour, a theoretical physicist, has worked on foundational i ssues in physics for 35 years. He _ is the author of the widely prai sed Absolute or Relative Motion?: Volume I, and is working on the s econd volume. Book review by Anthony Campbell. Copyright © Anthon y Campbell (2001). There have been many books about the paradoxes of t ime, but this one is far and away more paradoxical than most, for its thesis is that time doesn't exist at all. This idea is explor ed in great detail, mostly in relation to physics b ut the philosophical and even the theological implications are touched on in an Epilo gue. In fact, Barbour himself is something of a par adox, for he is a respected theoretical physicist who has remained independent, supporting himself and his family by translation w hile working on his ideas about time whenever he could. However he continued to keep in touch with mainstream physics and he acknowledges help from a number of well-known scientists, including Lee Smol in among others. The book, he tells us, is intended to interest that fabled beast, the \"general reader\", but he also ex pects his colleagues to look over his shoulder. He mentions Roger Penrose and Richard Dawkins as other scientists who have written simil ar types of books, and his own will certainly bear comparison with theirs . Like those authors, Barbour is an excellent write r, and his interests include philosophy, art, and literature as well as science so that his view of his subject is multidimensional ; no nonsense about \"two cultures\" here. In the first part of the book, Barbour sets forth a number of basic ideas which are then progressively elaborated in later parts. The central mystery that he confronts in his first thre e chapters is best described in his own words. \"The main aim is to introduce a definite way of thi nking about instants of time without having to supp ose that they belong to something that flows relentlessly forward . I regard instants of time as real things, identif ying them with possible instantaneous arrangements of all the thin gs in the universe. They are configurations of the universe. In themselves, these configurations are perfectly stat ic and timeless. But how and why can something stat ic and timeless be experienced as intensely dynamic and te mporal?\" These instants of time Barbour calls \"Nows\" or \"tim e capsules\". Examples include long-term memory stor ed within the brain,"},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":"fossils and geological records, and the human body, which contains within itself more time capsules ne sted one within another (cells, genes). The universe is composed of things like this, and it exists within what Barbour calls Platonia, which is an unimaginably vast configurational space. To help us understand what this means, Barbour uses the analo gy of Triangle Land: the different ways that triangles can be arranged in a configurational space. Much poring over of diagrams is needed here and elswhere in the book if his argument is to be grasp ed, and my attempt to do so wasn't helped initially when a Necker cube illusion made me think that a diagram was meant to represent a solid cube whereas it's really supposed to be ho llow. A note in the legend might have made this clearer. In fact, this book does demand close attention from the reader, in spite of the beautiful clarity of t he text. The difficulties are of at least two kinds. One comes from the complexity of t he physics. The theory that Barbour advances has pr ofound implications for both quantum mechanics and general relativity, and these implications are examined in considerable dep th. Part of Barbour's thesis is that his approach will reconcile these two funda mental scientific theories, something that ultimate ly baffled Einstein and has still not been achieved. Certain more technical or more p eripheral sections are enclosed in boxes, so the re ader can skip them if necessary, and other material is placed in the note s at the end. Even so, Barbour pays his reader the compliment of thinking that he or she is willing to come to terms with some pretty deep ideas. The other. and even more profound, kind of difficul ty arises from the nature of the theory itself. We feel as if we have our being in time. If there is no time, what meaning can we atta ch to the notions of past or future, and - even mor e difficult to accommodate - our peception of motion? Barbour suggests that what we see as motion, in a leaping cat or a diving kin gfisher, is really a series of still photographs, which are somehow brought togeth er by the brain to produce an illusion of movement. Of possible relevance here is the very interesting fact that in certain kinds of brain damage the ability to perceive objects in motion is lost. Barbour mentions this, but not the equally interesting observation, recorded by Oliver Sacks, that some patients suffer ing from post- encephalitic Parkinsonism found themselves frozen in time for ye ars, until released from this state, though only te mporarily, by the drug levodopa. Trying to picture oneself in a timeless state is pr obably something like a fish would feel if it tried to picture itself out of the water. Our language, of course, has no vocabulary to descr ibe this, and Barbour finds himself repeatedly forc ed to use temporal language to describe his theory, even though he acknowledges that this is just shorthand. Indeed, even if he is right, will it ever be possible to feel that he is? The analogy that comes to mind her e is with the shift from a geocentric to a heliocen tric universe that took place in the sixteenth century; no doubt many people, and no t only churchmen, found that hard to come to terms with, but the imaginative shift from a time-based to a timeless universe woul d be incomparably bigger. But is Barbour right? This is a mainly technical qu estion for physicists and cosmologists, but he does suggest some ways in which the theory can be tested; in other words, it is int ended to be physics, not metaphysics. Neverthless, profound metaphysical"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"questions are inevitably raised. Does free will exi st? Is there room for a Creator? Where is Heaven (a nd Hell)? Is time travel possible? Doesn't the denial of motion and change t ake all the joy out of life? Some of these are old chestnuts, of course, but they would need to be radically re-evaluated if Barbour' s theory were to become widely accepted. And, of co urse, the field is open for anyone who wants to have a go; Barbour merely opens the way for us to think about the implications. Fo r himself, he finds that his ideas, and those of Lee Smolin (who wrote \"The Life of the Cosmos\"), tend towards pantheism. \"The whol e universe ... is the closest we can get to a God.\" DISCOVER Vol. 21 No. 12 (December 2000) Table of Contents From Here to Eternity Imagine a universe with no past or future, where ti me is an illusion and everyone is immortal. Welcome to that world, says physicist Julian Barbour By Tim Folger Time seems to stand still in south newington, a sec luded village ringed by rolling green hills about 20 miles north of Oxford, England . The 1,000-year-old baptismal font in the town's church, the thatch-roo fed houses, and the tidy gardens along narrow lanes all appear unchanged by the passage of centuries. Standing on the roof of the church's bell tower on a warm, late-summer day, Julian Barbour, a theoretical physicist with some e xtraordinary notions about the nature of time, points to his home, known as Colleg e Farm, which borders the ancient church. \"It looks almost exactly as it did when it was buil t 340 years ago,\" says Barbour. \"The barn is also from the 17th century. Virtually all the houses you see around are from about 1640 to 1720. The long, low house is the one I grew up in. That's my parents' house. It dates from about 1710 to 1720.\" The entire scene is so placid one can't help but imagine that Barbour's childhood home, as well as the village and the surrounding landscape, will rem ain unchanged for the next 340 years. Such utter quiescence suits Barbour, who is convinc ed the static harmony of South Newington extends past the horizon to the uni verse at large. In his view, this moment and all it holds— Barbour himself, his American visitor, Earth, and everything beyond to the most distant galaxies— will never change. There is no past and no future. Indeed, time and motion are not hing more than illusions. In Barbour's universe, every moment of every indivi dual's life— birth, death, and everything in between— exists forever. \"Each ins tant we live,\" Barbour says, \"is, in essence, eternal.\" That means each an d every one of us is immortal. Like the perpetually unmoving lovers in Keats's \"Od e on a Grecian Urn,\" we are \"for ever panting, and for ever young.\" We are also for ever aged and decrepit, on our deathbeds, in the dentist's chair, at Thanksgivings with our in-laws, and reading these words. Barbour fully realizes how outrageous the notion of a world without time sounds. \"I still have trouble accepting it,\" he say s. But then, common sense has never been a reliable guide to understanding the un iverse— physicists have been confounding our perceptions since Copernicus f irst suggested that the sun does not revolve around Earth. After all, we don't feel the slightest movement as the spinning Earth hurtles through the void at s ome 67,000 miles per hour. Our sense of the passage of time, Barbour argues, i s just as wrongheaded as the credo of the Flat Earth Society. Barbour has been preoccupied with studying the basi c properties of time for four decades. It's an issue he believes most theore tical physicists have ignored.\"Given what a fascinating thing time is, it 's surprising how few"},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"physicists have made a serious attempt to study tim e and say exactly what it is,\" he says. \"It's an unusual gap.\" At the outset Barbo ur didn't think he would have any fresh insights he could bring to the topic. \"I don't regard myself as being at all talented. I struggle to do equations,\" he says, laughing. \"But I just got very interested in the subject and found that very few p eople have really thought seriously about it.\" Perhaps Barbour himself wouldn't have been able to devote nearly 40 years of his, well, time to the problem if it hadn't been fo r his unique background. Unlike most of his colleagues, he doesn't work at a univer sity or a government lab— he is one of the world's few freelance theoretical phy sicists. Nevertheless, his credentials are solid, and prominent physicists tak e him— and his unconventional ideas— quite seriously. \"He has some wild ideas, but he definitely knows wh at he's talking about when it comes to these fundamental issues,\" says Carlo R ovelli, who works at the Center for Theoretical Physics in Luminy, France. L ee Smolin, a theoretical physicist at Pennsylvania State University, agrees: \"Barbour is one of the few people I know who went out on their own and succeed ed in doing several things that were important and would not have been easy to do in a conventional career.\" After receiving his doctorate in physics from the U niversity of Cologne in 1968, Barbour, who is now 63, decided he didn't want to f ollow a traditional academic career, with the inevitable pressure to publish or perish. So he supported his wife and four children by translating Russian scien tific articles and worked on physics on the side, publishing scholarly papers ev ery few years. Outside academia, he was free to explore his interest in ti me without worrying about tenure or funding for what might seem an arcane pur suit. Until recently, Barbour's provocative work was litt le known beyond a rarefied circle of physicists. That changed earlier this yea r with the publication of his latest book, The End of Time, in which he presents his case for a universe where time, despite all appearances to the contrary , plays no role. Barbour's central argument is that a mistaken belie f in the reality of time prevents physicists from achieving their ultimate g oal: the unification of the submicroscopic atomic world of quantum mechanics wi th the vast cosmic one of general relativity. The problem arises because e ach theory provides a radically different conception of time, and physici sts simply don't know how to reconcile the two views. Until they do, they will n ever have one seamless theory of the universe comprising the very smallest objects to the very largest. And certain middling-sized objects— human beings— wil l never understand the true nature of time and existence. What makes the two versions of time so different? T ime in the quantum realm has no remarkable properties at all. In theories of quantum mechanics, time is essentially taken for granted; it simply regularly ticks away in the background, just as it does in our own lives. Like a clock at a sporting event, it provides an invisible framework in which events unfold. That's not the case in Einstein's general theory of relativity. To describe the universe on the largest scale, Eins tein had to weave time and space together into the very fabric of the universe . As a result, in general relativity, there is no invisible framework, no clo ck ticking outside the universe against which to measure events. How could there be ? Time and space joined together have weird consequences: Space and time cu rve around stars and other massive bodies and make light bend away from straight-line paths. Near black holes, time seems to slow down or even come t o a full stop. Barbour is not alone in recognizing that the pictur es of time in general relativity and quantum mechanics are fundamentally incompatibl e. Theoretical physicists around the world, spurred by Nobel dreams, sweat ov er the problem. But Barbour has taken perhaps the most unorthodox appro ach by proposing that the"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"way to solve the conundrum is to leave time out of the equations that describe the universe entirely. He has been obsessed with th is solution for more than 10 years, since he learned of a vexing mathematical to ur de force by a young American physicist named Bryce DeWitt. DeWitt, with the help of the eminent American physi cist John Wheeler, developed an equation in 1967 that apparently melde d quantum mechanics with general relativity. He did this by taking the princ iples from quantum mechanics that describe the interactions of atoms and molecul es and applying them to the entire universe, a mind-bending feat not unlike try ing to make a jockey's suit fit Michael Jordan. Specifically, DeWitt hijacked the Schrödinger equat ion, named for the great Austrian physicist who created it. In its original form, the equation reveals how the arrangement of electrons determines the geometr ical shapes of atoms and molecules. As modified by DeWitt, the equation desc ribes different possible shapes for the entire universe and the position of everything in it. The key difference between Schrödinger's quantum and DeWitt 's cosmic version of the equation— besides the scale of the things involved— i s that atoms, over time, can interact with other atoms and change their ener gies. But the universe has nothing to interact with except itself and has only a fixed total energy. Because the energy of the universe doesn't change with time , the easiest of the many ways to solve what has become known as the Wheeler- DeWitt equation is to eliminate time. Most physicists balk at that solution, believing it couldn't possibly describe the real universe. But a number of respected theorists, Barbour and Stephen Hawking among them, take DeWitt's work seriously. B arbour sees it as the best path to a real theory of everything, even with its staggering implication that we live in a universe without time, motion, or chan ge of any kind. Strolling in the meadows of oxford's Christ Church College with Julian Barbour, time and motion seem undeniable. Towering cumulus c louds float overhead, ferried by a gentle breeze. Children run and shout in the same field where Alice Liddell, the girl who inspired Lewis Carroll's Alic e's Adventures in Wonderland, often played. How can there be no time, no movement? Barbour settles his tall, lean frame into the grass, readyi ng himself for a long explanation to yet another skeptic. He begins with what seems a most straightforward proposition: Time is nothing but a measure of the c hanging positions of objects. A pendulum swings, the hands on a clock advance. Ob jects— and their positions— he argues, are therefore more fundamental than time. The universe at any given instant simply consists of many differ ent objects in many different positions. That sounds reasonable, as it should, coming from a thoughtful gentleman like Barbour. But the next part of his argument— the crux of his view— is much harder to swallow: Every possible configuration of the universe, past, present, and future, exists separately and eternally. We don 't live in a single universe that passes through time. Instead, we— or many slightly d ifferent versions of ourselves— simultaneously inhabit a multitude of sta tic, everlasting tableaux that include everything in the universe at any given mom ent. Barbour calls each of these possible still-life configurations a \"Now.\" E very Now is a complete, self-contained, timeless, unchanging universe. We m istakenly perceive the Nows as fleeting, when in fact each one persists fo rever. Because the word universe seems too small to encompass all possible Nows, Barbour coined a new word for it: Platonia. The name honors the anci ent Greek philosopher who argued that reality is composed of eternal and chan geless forms, even though the physical world we perceive through our senses a ppears to be in constant flux. Before allowing himself to be interrupted by the st ream of questions he knows will come, Barbour continues to press his point. He likens his view of reality to a"},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"strip of movie film. Each frame captures one possib le Now, which may include blades of grass, clouds in a blue sky, Julian Barbo ur, a baffled Discover writer, and distant galaxies. But nothing moves or changes in any one frame. And the frames— the past and future— don't disappear after th ey pass in front of the lens. \"This corresponds to the way you remember highlight s of your life,\" Barbour says. \"You remember very vividly certain scenes as snapshots. I remember once, very tragically, I had to go to a man who had shot himself. And I still have no difficulty in recalling the scene of opening the door just to where he was at the foot of the stairs and seeing him there with th e gun and the blood. It's still imprinted as a photograph on my mind. Many other me mories I have take that form. People have strong visual memories. If it's n ot just a snapshot, it might be a few stills of a movie you recall. Think of perhap s your most vivid memories. You don't think of them as just lasting a second. Y ou see them as snapshots in your mind's eye, don't you? They don't fade— they do n't seem to have any duration. They're just there, like the pages of a b ook. You wouldn't ask how many seconds a page lasts. It doesn't last a millis econd, or a second; it just is.\" Barbour calmly awaits the inevitable sputtering obj ections. Don't we then somehow shift from one \"frame\" to ano ther? No. There is no movement from one static arrangemen t of the universe to the next. Some configurations of the universe simply co ntain little patches of consciousness— people— with memories of what they cal l a past that are built into the Now. The illusion of motion occurs because many slightly different versions of us— none of which move at all— simultaneo usly inhabit universes with slightly different arrangements of matter. Eac h version of us sees a different frame— a unique, motionless, eternal Now. \"My position is that we are never the same in any two instants,\" Barbour sa ys. \"Obviously, as macroscopic human beings, we don't change much from second to second. And there's no question that we're the same people. I m ean only an extreme madman would deny that,\" he says reassuringly. \"To that extent, it's true that we do move from one Now to another. But in what sen se can you say we're moving? The way I see it, not exactly the same info rmation content, but nearly the same information content, is present in many di fferent Nows.\" Nothing really moves, he says. \"The information content or the consciousness that makes us aware of being ourselves, of having a certain identity, is just pr esent in many different Nows. There are two things that distinguish my position f rom what people might just intuitively think. First of all, the Nows are not o n one timeline. They're just there. And second, there is nothing corresponding t o motion. I'm taking a very radical position on that. I'm saying the Nows are r eally like snapshots. The impression of motion only arises because the snapsh ots have got an extraordinarily special structure.\" We are part of that special structure. For all the apparent complexity of his scheme, Barb our believes that it provides the simplest way to merge quantum mechanics and rel ativity into a single theory of the universe. Like all physicists, he strongly b elieves that mathematically elegant explanations tend to be true, even if they conflict with common sense. \"I think the approach I'm proposing does deserve to be taken seriously,\" he says. \"It would be extremely rash and stupid to say it's definitely right, but there's an inner logic to these ideas. They're very natural. I f we want to put quantum mechanics and general relativity together, what is the simplest way that could be done? I believe it is the way I've proposed. And I believe it is essentially the way that Bryce DeWitt discovered in 1967 when he fo und his infamous equation.\" Barbour stands and brushes some grass from his pant s. He has to meet his wife, Verena, for dinner and looks at his watch, gr inning as he does so. \"This is"},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"what comes of saying there is no time— I have to pul l my own leg sometimes,\" he says. Walking to a fashionable new restaurant on Oxford's old High Street, Barbour talks about how his ideas have changed his percepti ons of the world. \"I think it's completely wrong to say that the world was created in the Big Bang and that it was the unique creation event.\" Barbour hastens to add that there exists an eternal Now that contains the Big Bang, but he sees it as just one of an infinite array of Nows existing alongside this instant on Hi gh Street. \"Immortality is all around us,\" he says. \"Our task is to recognize it.\" How does the physics community react to such ideas? Physicists who know Barbour's work agree that it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. At a physics conference in Spain, Barbour conducted an informal poll. He asked how many of the physicists believed that time would not be a part of a final, complete description of the universe. A majority were inclin ed to agree. Don Page, a cosmologist at the University of Albert a in Edmonton who frequently collaborates with Stephen Hawking, raise d his hand that day. \"I think Julian's work clears up a lot of misconceptions,\" s ays Page. \"Physicists might not need time as much as we might have thought befo re. He is really questioning the basic nature of time, its nonexiste nce. You can't make technical advances if you're stuck in a conceptual muddle.\" S trangely enough, Page feels that Barbour might actually be too conservative. Wh en physicists finally iron out a new theory of the universe, Page suspects tha t time won't be the only casualty. \"I think space will go too,\" he says cryp tically. Like Page, Carlo Rovelli applauds Barbour for forci ng physicists to think about things they may have taken for granted. \"It's time to go back to the big questions,\" he says. \"We need a new way to think ab out the world. There are major philosophical challenges, and Julian is a par t of that.\" Barbour, meanwhile, is still developing his theory. With Niall Ó Murcha dha, an Irish physicist, he is attempting to formulate a modification of general r elativity in which not only time but also distance plays no role. In particular , his theory would predict that the universe, being static, is not expanding. The m ain evidence that physicists have for the expansion— the pervasive stretching of the spectra of light from distant galaxies known as the cosmic redshift— would instead be explained by the gravitational effects of neutron stars and blac k holes. \"If you want the wildly optimistic scenario,\" he sa ys, \"in which the Irishman and I develop this theory, make this prediction, and it turns out to agree with observations, then we would really be in the big ti me.\" The parish church next to Barbour's home contains s ome of the rarest murals in England. One painting, completed in about 1340, sho ws the murder of Thomas à Becket, the 12th-century archbishop whose beliefs c lashed with those of King Henry II. The mural captures the instant when a kni ght's sword cleaves Becket's skull. Blood spurts from the gash. If Barb our's theory is correct, then the moment of Becket's martyrdom still exists as an eternal Now in some configuration of the universe, as do our own deaths . But in Barbour's cosmos, the hour of our death is not an end; it is but one of the numberless components of an inconceivably vast, frozen structure. All the experiences we've ever had and ever will have lie forever fixed, set like crys talline facets in some infinite, immortal jewel. Our friends, our parents, our child ren, are always there. In many ways it's a beautiful and comforting vision. B ut the question still nags: Could it possibly be true? Only time will tell. Is There Life After Death? Julian Barbour is convinced we are all immortal. Un fortunately, in a timeless universe immortality does not come with the same ki nd of perks that it does on Mount Olympus. In Barbour's vision, we are not like Greek gods who remain forever young. We still have to buy life insurance, and we will certainly seem to age and die. And instead of life after death, there is life alongside death. \"We're"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"always locked within one Now,\" Barbour says. We do not pass through time. Instead, each new instant is an entirely different universe. In all of these universes, nothing ever moves or ages, since time i s not present in any of them. One universe might contain you as a baby staring at your mother's face. In that universe you will never move from that one, still s cene. In yet another universe, you'll be forever just one breath away from death. All of those universes, and infinitely many more, exist permanently, side by si de, in a cosmos of unimaginable size and variety. So there is not one immortal you, but many: the toddler, the cool dude, the codger. The tragedy— or perhaps it's a blessing— is that no one version recognizes its own immortality. Would you really want to be 14 for eternity, waiting for your civics class to e nd? As odd as this vision of a timeless world might see m, Barbour believes there is something stranger still to ponder: the very fact o f our existence. \"Creation and the fact that anything is— this for me is the comple te mystery,\" he says. \"The fact that we are here is totally mysterious.\" — T.F. 1st Law and Newtonian space and time. One of the most important consequences of the First Law is that it defines what we mean by an inertial frame of reference. An inertial reference frame is a reference frame wh ere isolated bodies are seen to move in straight lines at constant velocity. An observer at rest with respect to an inertial fra me of reference is called an inertial observer. The laws of physics devised by Newton take a particularly simple form when express ed in terms of quantities measured by an inertial o bserver (such as positions, velocities, etc.). For example, an inertial observe r will find that a body on which no forces act move s in a straight line at constant speed or is at rest. All motion occurs in space and is measured by time. In Newton's model both space and time are unaffect ed by the presence or absence of objects. That is space and time are abso lute, an arena where the play of Nature unfolds. In Newton's words, Absolute space in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and im movable. ...absolute and mathematical time, of itself, and f rom its own nature, flows equally without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration. Space and time were taken to be featureless objects which served as a universal and preferred referenc e frame (see Fig. 4.9 for an illustration). A consequence of this is that a g iven distance will be agreed upon by any two observ ers at rest with respect to each other or in uniform relative motion, for, afte r all, they are just measuring the separation betwe en two immovable points in eternal space. In the same way a time interval will be agreed upon by any two observers for they are j ust marking two notches on eternal time. Figure 4.9: Illustration of Newton's concept of spa ce. The grids represent space which are unaffected by the presence and properties of the objects in it. Newton's assumptions about space and time are the f oundation of his theory of Nature and were accepted due to the enormous successes of the predictions. Eventually, however, experimental results appeared which disagreed with the predictions derived from Newton's theory. These problems were traced to the fact that these basic assumptions are not accu rate"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"descriptions of space and time (though they do represent a very good appr oximation): space and time are not absolute (Chaps. 6, 7) . The realization that Newton's theory required revisions came to a head at the beginning of the XXth centur y. In the two decades from 1905 to 1925 a completely new framework was constru cted and has now replaced Newton's ideas. These the ories comprise the special and general theories of relativity and quan tum mechanics. Do we know that the current theories of space and t ime are the truth? The answer is no: we do know tha t the current theories explain all the data (including the one explained b y Newton and more), but we cannot determine whether they represent the ultimate theories of Nature. In fact, we expect the m not to be the last word as there are many unexpla ined questions; for example, why should the proton be precisely 1836.153 times h eavier than the electron? Why should space have 3 a nd not 25 dimensions? etc. But in the 17th century there was no inkling of the se problems and very few scientist questioned Newto n's hypothesis. In particular Newton constructed his mechanics to comply with Gal ilean relativity: an observer in uniform motion wit h respect to another cannot, without looking outside his laboratory, det ermine whether he is at rest or not. And even if he looks outside, he cannot decide whether he is in motion or the other observe r is. In fact for two inertial observers moving rel ative to each other the question, ``which of us is moving?'' is un-answerab le and meaningless. The only thing to be said is th at they have a certain relative velocity. Traveling Through Time NOVA ONLINE by Clifford Pickover What is time? Is time travel possible? For centurie s, these questions have intrigued mystics, philosophers, and scientists. Much of ancient Greek philosophy was concerned with understanding the concept of eternit y, and the subject of time is central to all the world's r eligions and cultures. Can the flow of time be stopped? Certainl y some mystics thought so. Angelus Silesius, a sixth-centu ry philosopher and poet, thought the flow of time coul d be suspended by mental powers: Time is of your own making; its clock ticks in your head. The moment you stop thought time too stops dead. The line between science and mysticism sometimes gr ows thin. Today physicists would agree that time is one of the strangest properties of our univ erse. In fact, there is a story circulating among scientists of an immigrant to America who has lost his watch. He walks up to a man on a New York street and asks, \"Please, Sir, what is time?\" The s cientist replies, \"I'm sorry, you'll have to ask a philosopher. I'm just a physicist.\" Most cultures have a grammar with past and future t enses, and also demarcations like seconds and minutes, and yesterday and tomorrow. Yet we cannot say exactly what time is. Although the study of time became scientific during the time of Galileo a nd Newton, a comprehensive explanation was given only in this century by Einstein, who declare d, in effect, time is simply what a clock reads. Th e clock can be the rotation of a planet, sand falling in an hourglass, a heartbeat, or vibrations of a cesium atom. A typical grandfather clock follows th e simple Newtonian law that states that the velocity of a body not subject to external forces r emains constant. This means that clock hands travel equal distances in equal times. While this k ind of clock is useful for everyday life, modern science finds that time can be warped in various wa ys, like clay in the hands of a cosmic sculptor."},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"Science-fiction authors have had various uses for t ime machines, including dinosaur hunting, tourism, visi ts to one's ancestors, and animal collecting. Ever since the time of H.G. Wells' famous novel The Time Machine (1895) , people have grown increasingly intrigued by the ide a of traveling through time. (I was lucky enough to have chats with H.G. Wells' grandson, who told me that his grandfather's book has never been out of print, whi ch is rare for a book a century old.) In the book, the protago nist uses a \"black and polished brass\" time machine to gain mec hanical control over time as well as return to the present to bring back his story and assess the consequences of the p resent on the future. Wells was a graduate of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, and scientific language permeates his discussions. Many believe Wells' book to be the first story about a time machine, bu t seven years before 22-year-old Wells wrote the first version of The Time Machine, Edward Page Mitc hell, an editor of the New York Sun, published \"The Clock That Went Backward.\" One of the earliest methods for fictional time trav el didn't involve a machine; the main character in Washington Irving's \"Rip van Winkle\" (1819) simply fell asleep for decades. King Arthur's daughter Gweneth slept for 500 years under Merlin's spell. A ncient legends of time distortion are, in fact, qui te common. One of the most poetic descriptions of time travel occurs in a popular medieval legend describing a monk entranced for a minute by the son g of a magical bird. When the bird stops singing, the monk discovers that several hundred ye ars have passed. Another example is the Moslem legend of Muhammad carried by a mare into he aven. After a long visit, the prophet returns to Earth just in time to catch a jar of water the hors e had kicked over before starting its ascent. Time travel is possible Today, we know that time travel need not be confine d to myths, science fiction, Hollywood movies, or even speculation by theoretical physicists. Time tr avel is possible. For example, an object traveling at high speeds ages more slowly than a stationary o bject. This means that if you were to travel into outer space and return, moving close to light speed , you could travel thousands of years into the Earth's future. Newton's most important contribution to science was his mathematical definition of how motion changes with time. He showed that the force causing apples to fall is the same force that drives planetary motions and produces tides. However, Newt on was puzzled by the fact that gravity seemed to operate instantaneously at a distance. He admitted he could only describe it without understanding how it worked. Not until Einstein's g eneral theory of relativity was gravity changed from a \"force\" to the movement of matter along the shortest space in a curved spacetime. The Sun bends spacetime, and spacetime tells planets how to move. For Newton, both space and time were absolute. Space was a fixed, infinite, unmoving met ric against which absolute motions could be measured. Newton also believed the universe was per vaded by a single absolute time that could be symbolized by an imaginary clock off somewhere in s pace. Einstein changed all this with his relativity theories, and once wrote, \"Newton, forgi ve me.\" Einstein's first major contribution to the study of time occurred when he revolutionized physics with his \"special theory of relativity\" by showing how time changes with motion. Today, scient ists do not see problems of time or motion as \"absolute\" with a sin gle correct answer. Because time is relative to the speed one is travel ing at, there can never be a clock at the center of the universe to w hich everyone can set their watches. Your entire life is the blink of an eye to an alien traveling close to the speed of light. Today, Newto nian mechanics have become a special case within Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein's relativity will eventually become a subs et of a new science more comprehensive in its description of the fabric of our universe.

Despite our mental limitations, we have come remarkably far. We have managed to pull back the cosmic curtains a crack to let in the light. Questions raised by physicists, from Newton to Kurt Gödel to Einstein to Stephen Hawking , are among the most profound we can ask. Is time real? Does it flow in one direction only? D oes it have a beginning or an end? What is eternity ? None of these questions can be answered to scientis ts' satisfaction. Yet the mere asking of these questions stretches our minds, and the continual se arch for answers provides useful insights along the way. Exactly what is it that we are measuring? <P>In his book &quot;Companion to the Cosmos&quot; John Gribbin states that everybody knows what time is, but nobody can explai n what it is, and that in physics, the important thing about time is that it provides a reference system (a set of coordinates) in which events can b e ordered. One event comes before or after another in this system. He go es on to say that it is important that, although this defines an<B> </B> arrow of time, there is no suggestion anywhere in the laws of physics th at time actually flows from the past through the present and into the futu re. An interesting point that Gribbin goes on to make is that all times have equal status and that this shows up most forcefully in Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity where time is regarded as a fourth dimension, on an equal footing with the familiar three dimensions of space. He says that yo u can imagine all of space and time represented as a four dimensional sp acetime map, on which all of history, the present and the future of the u niverse can be represented.</P> <P>If Einstein's Special Theory of relativity is ri ght, then according to Gribbin this raises interesting questions about the nature of destiny and freewill - is the future 'already there' in some se nse, just waiting for our consciousness to move over it? But Gribbin goes on to say that the uncertainty inherent in <A HREF=\"Quantum%20mechanics\">Quantum M echanics</A><B> </B>suggests that a better theory of space and time, merging rel ativity and quantum theory, may restore the vagueness of the future to the desc ription of spacetime.</P> <P>So did that help at all?

How about a minute from now? that is still obviously the future, and a second from now? well yes, it is stil l in the 'future'. A thousandth of a second, a millionth of a second? A what precise time interval does the future merge into the present and for how long before it merges into the past? Does time unfold in a smooth continu ous flow or in small discreet steps?

How long does the present last and precisely what d oes 'now' mean?</P> <P>It would appear to be impossible to define 'now' as a precise moment in time that could be used as a universal standard. It seems to be a personal experience as perceived by the individual, our own unique frame of reference. In this sense time would appear to be a unique even t to every observer, and this is indeed in agreement with relativity. Ev en the speed at which time passes is individual to the observer depending on their speed and on the strength of any gravitational field they may ha ppen to be in. The future to is also unique to the observer depending on when the individual enters the future light cone of an event.

In this sense then, time is not something real, but only something that we expe rience, in the same way that we can experience pain although pain itself on ly exists in our minds and not in the 'real' world. In other words, time i s dependent on our consciousness. Would then, for example, the universe continue to e xpand and evolve if it did not contain sentient beings that could observe it? (I think that this question has the same merit as asking - if a tree f ell down in the forest and there was nobody there to hear it, would it mak e a noise?) The answer would be it doesn't matter, it would be meaningless to ask! If there were no sentient beings in the universe, the question co uld not be raised!</P> <P>If we look at time from the opposite view point we can consider the implications of time not existing. The only condition that I can imagine for time not existing is in an infinite eternal nothing as descr ibed in the previous page. In this context the concept of 'always' is a fundamental requirement of the very existence of nothing. If the universe d oes indeed exist in nothing it must always exist in nothing, without a past, pr esent or future because these terms could not exist. See <A HREF=\"Origin%20 of%20the%20universe%20\">Where did the universe come from?</A> This would suggest that 'always' requires the absence of time.</P> <P>An interesting observation regarding time as bei ng relative is that individually we have no way of determining the rate at which tim e is passing. An astronaut travelling at near light speed would not be able to detect that time had slowed down, it would only be apparent on his retur n to base when he compares his clock with the base clock and observes a differ ence. While traveling at near light speed our astronaut has no means of d etecting that time has slowed down, everything would appear to be perfectl y normal aboard his space craft. (A look out of the window would reveal that something was amiss, but our astronaut could not prove if it is him that is moving or the objects passing by!) A recent television program demonstrat ed the relationship of movement and time to good effect by setting two ato mic clocks to show the same time to within a very accurate degree. One of the clocks was sent by 'plane from London to Tokyo and back while the othe r remained in the studio. The two clocks were compared on return and the cloc k that had remained in the studio was shown to be running slightly ahead. What does this simple experiment tell us? It tells us that the effect is real, time really does run slower for a moving object, it isn't just in ou r heads, clocks are not sentient!</P> <P>So is the effect of time running at different sp eeds a 'real ' effect irrespective of whether or not it is being measured ? No. We do not know what time is doing when we are not measuring it. We would be making foolish assumptions if we assumed that time always behaved the same way regardless of whether or not it was being observed. We do not know! It is the same as the behaviour of electrons in Quantum Mechanics, we do not know what they are doing when we are not observing them. We c an only know what is taken place while we are observing.</P> <P>So is time 'real'?</P> <P>I dislike the idea that the future may be 'alrea dy there' just waiting for us to pass over it, for as John Gribbin states, where does that leave destiny and freewill? See <A HREF=\"Free%20Will\">Do we have free will? </A>If on the other hand the future is not already there, then where does that leave the special theory of relativity ? If time is 'real' in the same way that the other three dimensions are real, this woul d indicate that it does exists and is there waiting for our consciousness ' to move over it'.

This teaches us that when a person accustoms himself to the study of the Mystery of Creation and the Mystery of the Chariot, it is impossible that he not stumbl e.

When humans began to walk erect they transcendended the typical condition of primates. It is because of our vertical posture that we organize space into four horizontal directions radiating from an\"up/down\" central axis. We automatically organize the space around our bodies as extending forward, backward, to right, left, upward and downward. Thus we orient ourselves to the apparently limitless, unknown and thre atening extension. We need a method of orientation because it is impossible to survi ve long"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"in the vertigo brought on by disorientation. Our experience of space is primar ily oriented around a \"center\" and explains the importance of paradigmatic divis ions of our experiential field. This model of experiential space is projected into mythical, celestial space as the cosmogony. The very theory of celestial models continues and develops the universally disseminated archaic conception that man's acts are only the r epetition (imitation) of acts revealed by divine beings. The divine modality is def ined by the powers and \"transcendence\" of space. Precosmogonic chaos can be conceptu ally ordered, and this is an archetypally divine act. The numinous character of di vinity increases by becoming brighter. Light is considered the particular at tribute of divinity, Initial Perfection. In Paleolithic times, familiarity with different modalities of matte r gave rise to imaginative activity. The first signs of ancient religious sense came from b urial rites. Early inventions, such as primitive tools and domestic skills gave rise t o imaginative analogies. Through activites such as sewing, shaping statuettes, and making hun ting tools objects came to be laden with symbolism. The imaginary world was create d and enriched by intimacy with matter. This imaginary realm was inadequately grasped in figurative and geometric creations of various prehistoric cultures. This imaginative experience is still accessible to us. There is a continuity to this plane of imaginative activity w hich permeates throughout human history and spiritual notions. The imaginal acti vity of the ancients had a mythological dimension. Many of the supernatural figures and mythological events which appear in later religious traditions, were probab ly discoveries of the Stone Age. For millennia Mother Earth gave birth by hers elf, through parthenogenesis. Born from the Earth, man returned there when h e died. The development of agrarian cultures ushered in notions of circular tim e and cosmic cycles. The confrontation between two cosmogonic principles, ti me and space, meant a new orientation to both inner and outer life. A settled exis tence organizes the \"world\" differently from a nomadic life. The seed \"dies \" and is then reborn in order to multiply. Thus death ensures a new birth. Agricultu re demands a different relationship to the seasons and weather--to earth and sky, and t his had a deep impact on religious values. The theme is one of periodic renewal. \"For religious creativity was stimulated, not by the empirical phenomen on of agriculture, but by the mystery of birth, death, and rebirth identified in the rhythm of vegetation. In order to be understood, accepted, and mastered, the crises that threaten the harvest (floods, draughts, etc.) will be translated i nto mythological dramas. These mythologies and the ritual scenarios that depend on them will dominate the religions of the Near East for millennia. The mythical theme of gods who die and return to life is among the most important.\""},{"pageNumber":804,"pageContent":"\". . .The agrarian cultures develop what may be called a cosmic religion, since religious activity is concentrated around the central mystery: the per iodical renewal of the world. Like human existence, the cosmic rhythms are expresse d in terms drawn from vegetable life. The mystery of cosmic sacrality is symbolized in the World Tree. The universe is conceived as an organism th at must be renewed periodically--in other words, each year. 'Absolute reality,' rejuvination, immortality are accessible to certain privileged persons th rough the power residing in a certain fruit or in a spring near a tree. The Cosmic Tree is held to be at the center of the world, and it unites the three cosmic region s, for it sends its roots down into the underworld, and its top touches the sky.\" \"...The Cosmic Tree is the most widespread expression of the axis mundi; but the symbolism of the cosmic axis probably precedes--or is independent of--the agricultural civilizations, since it is found in certain arctic cultur es.\" (Eliade, 1978). The cosmic axis defines and reiterates the divine energy flow between Sky (Kether) and Earth (Malkuth). It reiterates our ancestral vertical posture on the cosmic level, drawing a polarized line between the celestial and terrestrial. When w e are in sacred space, we become that cosmic axis, incarnate. It is a cross-cultural, univer sal model. In the Hebrew adaptation of this cosmic Tree model, there are differe nces and similarities to the older cults of western Asia. Archaic ideas about t he creation of the world were taken up and reiterated. Mesopotamian legends formed muc h of the raw material. However, the main distinction from the agricultural fertili ty cults was that the Hebrews did not worship the Earth or forces of nature. This repre sented a break from conventional religious forms and was the new basis for the clan' s spiritual life and ethos. But, they were unavoidably pre-conditioned by the dominant Mesopotamian culture. Living on the outskirts of this society they incorporated notions , such as a Law or code. The very idea of a code is Mesopotamian, and cannot be found in ancient Egypt. The primary difference in orientation is shown by the fact that the He brew Tree of Life reverses the neolithic notion of an earth-rooted sacred Tree. The qabalistic Tree is rooted in Heaven, with its branches extending downward toward earthly manifestation. The emanation is from the formless limitless light in to corporeality by means of geometric unfoldment, from pure energy converted into ma tter. But, the Mesopotamian influence is seen here as well. Sumeria revered a triad of great gods, analogous to the Supernal Triad (1-2-3) of the Tree of Life; followed by a triad of planetary gods (4-5-6), followed by lesser gods. This cosmic rhythm is sustained in the qabalistic Tree. Like the f ertility cults, the cosmic axis is conceived of as a relationship between a primordial coupl e ( Elohim; God and Shekinah , or Malkuth , the Bride; the Right (masc.) and Left"},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"(fem.) Pillars of the Tree). Their union is a hieros gamos , or sacred marriage which results in the manifestation of all things. Qabala also incorporates the themes of circular and cosmic time, by valorizin g the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (initiation). This is the archaic idea of the periodic renewal of the world which resurfaces as ritual, magical exercises and di sciplines. It is primarily for the agriculturalist that the \"true world\" or space in w hich he lives is the \"center of the world.\" It is consecrated by rituals and prayers, and in that sacred space communication with divinity is effected. Habitation of a sacred place led to the cosmological symbolism of sacred architecture. The Sumerians were the first to erect monumental te mples, and to record myths of the quest for immortality. They invented notions about a 12 -fold Zodiac, planetary astrology, magic and divination, spirits and demons, and later (from Babylon) angels. Akkadian religious thought also contributed the imp ortance accorded to the personal element in religious experience. These were i ncorporated into Qabala in such ideas as the path of return, planetary spheres, spiritual hierarchy and demonology. All this percolated down from the earliest neolithic cultures wit h their primal root- metaphors: • Cults of the dead and of fertility, indicated by statuettes of goddesses, and of the storm god. • Beliefs and rituals connected with the \"mystery\" of vegetation. • Assimilation of the identity of woman/cultivated soil/plant, implying the homology birth/rebirth (initiation). • Very probably the hope of a postexistence. • A cosmology including the symbolism of a \"center of the world\" and inhabited space as an imago mundi."},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"This represents a cosmic cycle of chthonian fertility and life/death/ postexistence. These root metaphors are powerful, and have persisted into modern times in our religions. Many of the primal notions were incorporated into the classic li terature of written Kabbalah in the Middle Ages, particularly the Sephir Yetzirah, the Bahir, and Zohar, and the codification of the Tree of Life and Cube of Space or Throne- Chariot. These qabalistic texts exhibit considerable variation. We can see that thes e spiritual ideas about orientation in space/time have evolved through the centuries . We have every reason to believe that our view will continue to evolve to a new understan ding of the meaning of the Universe or cosmic existence (where we are), our exist ence (who we are), and post-mortum continuation (where we are going). Throughout most of the history of Kabbalah, the Tree of Life wasn't standardize d or very geometrical. The emanations were contemplated in a variety of forms. The geometrically regular triplet array came much later. Path positions and at tributions differed markedly, and there are several arrays of the emanations devised f or various purposes. Even prior to formalization of the Tree of Life, the visionary experience of the Throne Chariot was pursued as \"the Work of the Chariot.\" This work, or Merkavah mysticism is the meditative branch of Qabala. But when it came to this central image, or template of divinity, there was much dis cussion in the evolving esoteric tradition over the pattern of the Chariot of Light. Unlike th e Sephiroth which are not spatial, but qualities of Nothingness, the C hariot is a template or spiritual projection--a form and state which arises during mystical meditation. Both its rewards and the extreme dangers of this practice by t he impure are covered in the Bahir , The Book of Illumination, published in 1175. This is one of the oldest Kabbalistic texts, and contains the earliest discussion of t he Sefirot and reincarnation. This work emphasizes meditative techniques to allow seers to develop profound astral visions of \"God's Throne\" by themselves becoming \"chariots\" or ve hicles to the divine. They used the Hebrew equivalent of mantras and mandalas to facil itate their practice. Since the Jews were in the Babylonian exile and their ear thly Temple had been destroyed, perhaps it was an attempt to internalize sacred spac e--to worship in an inner Temple. The origin of this meditative practice goes back to Ezekiel, and according to Kabbalah, his vision of the Chariot was in the Universe of Yetzirah, the astr al realm of Formation. This is the level where it is said God \" fills all worlds .\" We look down into our own soul to see Him. Once again, the opposition to fertility cults i s emphasized: \"Specifically characteristic of agriculturalists, cosmic religiosity continued the most elementary dialectic of the sacred, especially the belief that the di vine is incarnated, or manifest itself, in cosmic objects and rhythms. Now such a bel ief was denounced by the adherents of Yahweh as the worst possible idolatry, and this ever since the the Israelites' entrance into Palestine. But never was cosmic"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"religiosity so savagely attacked. The prophets finally succeeded in emptying nature of any divine presence. Whole sectors of the natural world--the \"hi gh places,\" stones, springs, trees, certain crops, certain flowers--will be den ounced as unclean because they were polluted by the cult of the Canaanite divinitie s of fertility. The preeminently clean and holy region is the desert alone, for i t is there that Israel remained faithful to its God. The sacred dimension of vegetation and, in general, of the exuberant epiphanies of nature will be rediscovered only late, in medieval Judaism.\" (Eliade, 1978). This total and violent rejection of cosmic religiosity and nature symbolism was apparently sublimated in the work of the Chariot, because as we now know, its geometry actually reflects the deepest secrets of nature and the cosm os in terms of the formation of all possible things, from the macrocosmic to microcosm ic. Religiosity graduated from the physical to the metaphysical realm, and became a \"way of knowing.\" Metaphysical knowledge presumably gave man control of himself, instincts and actions, and permitted living a fully worthy lif e. Events no longer reflect the eternal rhythm of the cosmic cycle or depend on the stars, they develop in accordance with God's plan. The advent of syncretism in the Hellenistic world brought exposure to Gr eek ideas. The Greeks tried to impose their way of life on the Jews. Both Arab and Jewish philosophers engaged in scholastic metaphysics which proposed that th e universe must have had a beginning in time, hence a Creator God, which implies the uni ty of creation, and shows that the soul is of God. Truth is one. The acquiring of tru th is a religious duty. Reason and revelation are complementary. Still, philosophy al one is not a religious enterprise. The goal of philosophy is right action. A theology which equates God's law with order and stability in nature, is st ill mistaking the creation for the dynamic transcendent Creator, worshippi ng creation rather than Creator. Philosophy suggested that immortality was an achievemen t of the soul which has activated its full potential for knowing. This is pe rhaps the subtle mistake or stumbling of the Daath-level, over-intellectualizing, rathe r than obediently following the Lord's Will as the Bible dictates. True knowled ge of things divine comes through love of God. Only love admits one to God's supernal mysteries. One of the most original religious creations of the Hellenistic period i s the personification of wisdom as the Shekinah. In Greek form, Sophia as a divine and personfied entity appears comparatively late in the Hermetic writi ngs. This feminine counterpart of God plays a major role in the metaphors of polar dynamic s in the Tree of Life. In Proverbs , Shekinah declares that Yahweh created her before the oldest of his works, that she was firmly set from the beginning, before earth came int o being. This echoes the notion of a virtual state prior to and underlying physical manifestation, a virtual matrix of formation.. Wisdom emerged from the Lord's mouth. Among the realm of Jewish-inspired \"intermediate beings\" bet ween man"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"and God, Shekinah was elevated to supreme authority, the mediatrix. She is d ivine immanence. Intuitive perception of the subtleties of metaphysical reality has evolve d as philosophies have shifted. The more we know about the empirical nature of phenomenal reality, the more our intuitive concepts come into harmonizat ion with the nature of Reality. At the risk of error, \"stumbling\" and admonishment, we can conceive of a postmodern view of the Tree and the Throne-Chariot, with analogie s to current physics theories. But this theory may be more than analogy or metap hor- -it is the way things are, and therefore phenomenological. It unites psyche an d matter in the alchemical Unus Mundus , or One World. An evolving esoteric tradition allows us to course-correct symbolic, in tuitive notions about the nature of reality. In this pursuit, we are not trying to improve or de file Qabala, but employ our spiritual sensitivity to engage in true speculation, or se eing in the sense of the seer. A medieval Kabbalist said, \"the philosophers can only surmise what exists in the metaphysical realm, while the Kabbalists can actually see it.\" Three events influenced the evolution of Kabbalah in the Middle Ages: the printing press; discovery of the New World; and the Spanish Inquisition. As Kabbal ah began to be written down, there was a need for outlining its organizing principle s, systematizing it in a philosophical structure. We can only deduce what is c orrect from the considerable variations of Qabala by the logical derivation of formulas and true vision, not allegory, or even metaphor. Truth is one. Our modern model meets religious, psychological, and physical criteria for depicting this ancient core image with even more clarity, making it cry stal clear. Theological flexibility is a qabalistic tradition. Theosophical speculati on is prmarily based on insight rather than systematics. Through it we weave reason and revelation into a seamless unity. A RE-VISIONING OF THE COSMIC TREE \"537.131 Six Vectors for Every Point: The behavioral interpatterning frame of reference of the six degrees of freedom in respect to omnidirectionality i s of course the vector equilibrium, which embraces the three-dimensional ity of the cube and the six-dimensionality of the vector equilibrium. Experience is inherently omnidirectional; ergo, there is always a minimum of 12 \"others\" in respect to the nuclear observing self. The 24-positive and 24-negative vectored vector equilibrium demonstrates an initially frequenced, tertahedrally quantized unity of 20; ergo, the Universe as an aggregate of all humanity's apprehended and comprehended experiences, is at minimum a plurality of 24 vectors.\" (R. Buckminster Fuller, 1979). All events can be described mathematically in space time. According to F uller there are six vectorial moves for every event. Each of the vectorial moves is reversi ble,"},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"hence 12. Therefore, all positional differentials in the Universe der ive only from the sixness of the 12 degrees of freedom. The Tree of Life emerges from an unobservable or implicate geometrical matrix. This isotropic vector matrix is dynamically inter-tensioned. The dynami c interaction and tension among the Spheres of the Tree of Life functions synergetic ally. We can revision the old notion of static hierarchy; the synergetic state could be called \" synarchy .\" Though the geometry of the Tree stays the same, our notion of its dynamics can take a quantum leap forward in conceptual terms. We can keep viewing the Tree in, at best, 19th century terms, or contemporize to 21st cent ury paradigms. Buckminster Fuller pointed out that ancient philosophical and sci entific thought was based on the notion of the cube, rather than the tetrahedron, nature's most economical self-organizing base unit. This mistake of the Greek mathem aticians has been perpetuated down through the ages, but we can correctly revision the matrix of reality with a few simple adjustments in our thinking. The Synergetic Qabala includes original graphics and paintings which help make these conc eptual changes clearer. Experiential phenomena, including mystical states, are inseparable from the physical universe, and are deeply connected with the laws which govern t he physical universe. Buckminster Fuller advanced a single model to describe th e shape of the physical universe, the shape of energy's behavior, the shape of our thinking, an d the shape of the metaphysical or philosophical universe. He considered adopt ion of the cube in classical times as misguided and erroneous, since it has nothin g to do with nature's own coordinates. With the cube and the square the ancient Greek mathematicians entere d the world of nature and Reality by the wrong door, rather than through Nature's Way which is in triangles and tetrahedra. Without meaning to be critical, the early Qabal ists perpetuated this partial truth, in what we can term their \"Cube-ala,\" w ith its primary geometries of the Tree of Life and Throne-Chariot or Cube of Spac e. "},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"\"THE CUBE OF SPACE\" by Iona Miller, c1982 Three dimensions can be modeled with perpendiculars in the cube . Four dimensions can be modeled with equiangularity in the tetrahedron. What the three axes of the cube do for three dimensions, the four axes of the tetrahedron do for four dimensions. The tetrahedron provides for the convergence and divergence of four centrally-coordinate planes. Fuller says it is erroneous to describe time as a fourth dimension; he says that all dimensions require time. Einstein (and later QM) demonstrated that time emanates from the observer. The tetrahedron is stability incarnate, a nest of principle. In Qabala, the Spheres themselves are actually numbers, (Sephiroth mean s number) and in Fuller's geometric philosophy, there is a direct rel ationship between number and geometry. Fuller created the first explicit for mulas for the area of a circle in triangular modules and for the volume of a sphere in tetrahedral modules--all without pi . In contrast to the classical XYZ coordinates, Fuller's three-way great circle grid, has 60-degree coordinat ion and a tetrahedral matrix. This is nature's way, since there are no 90 degree angles in nature, no true perpendiculars. We can retune or tune-in a clearer picture of the nature of the primal m atrix, since we have made conceptual advances over the ancients. The reciprocal operation of the old alchemical notion of \" squaring the circle \" is to envisioned the old Cube of Space encompassed by its precipitating matri x, from which it emanates. an encircling Sphere. The 12-dimensional model defines not only 'top down' object-space, but also 'bottom up' self-tim e, with the potential for psyche/consciousness to exist in every particle in the psychophysical universe from the start. "},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"German mathematician Georg F.B. Riemann proposed the hypersphere as a model of the cosmos. The so-called Riemann sphere is the three-dimensional surfac e of a four- dimensional ball, and presumes the hypersphere is not embedded in any h igher- dimensional space. Einstein chose this shape as the hypothetical overall s hape of the cosmos when he fomulated his first relativity model. It models a finite spac e without a problematic boundary. The null directions at a point (Vector Equilibrium) have the holomor phic structure of a Riemann sphere. This holomorphic structure is implied as lying \"behi nd the scenes\" in solutions of Einstein's (vacuum) equations. We can imagine a twelve-dime nsional matrix mapped onto a Sphere, representing all possible modes of psychophysical s pace and time. When all possible modes of space and time are mapped onto the Riemann sphe re, we see an ascending 'ladder' of dimensions (where time manifests) and we also f ind six complementary pairs of opposites. Though they are superimposed, a 'top-d own' view of this 'ladder' is the perspective of our Left Hemisphere consciousn ess (\"the Observer\"), while a 'bottom-up' view reflects the Right Hemisphere state of Bein g. These superpositions constitute our experience of psychophysical reality. The top-down information state is our control structure, psyche or soul, with its compl ementary quantum superposition soma , the supply structure. In a sense, life is the experience of dynamic geometrical transformations. The apprehension of the geometric proper ties of a 'circle,'-- the 12 dimensional matrix--both intrinsically and extrinsically, are cruc ial for human higher-order consciousness. According to Burrow: \"...a sentient being could only sense that his or her universe was informe d by a twelve- dimensional matrix, both at the extrinsic'classical' macro- as well as quantu m mechaical intrinsic level, once he/she had ascended beyond the 'circle's ' half-way point, i.e. as represented specifically by the seventh-dimension. This extr insic/intrinsic apprehension of being in the pressence of a circle/sphere is best illustra ted by Pythagoras' derivation of all numbers from the geometric properties of a circ le. 'Mathematical Platonism', too--the notion that numbers are not \"real\" and that mathematical concepts exist in a timeless, ethereal realm--derives from this same experientially apprehended 'geometric source.\" The invisible (or implicate) presence of the self-organizing 12-dimen sional template at the quantum level is the virtual substrate of classical structure and vice ve rsa. It yields six pairs of complementary psychophysical dimensions of space and time and space-t ime. This psychophysical model demonstrates a synthesis between physics and psych ology. See \" A Psychophysical Theory of Everything: Consciousness Beyond Complemen tarity ,\" by Barron Burrow. http://www.maximus.dircon.co.uk/ It is a model for transcendence or experience of holistic \"no time,\" and n onlocality in the 11th dimension ( Daath ).

With so many of our cultural institutions and ideas undergoing transformation, wher e can we turn for a user-friendly approach to the problems of living? We are bombarded with information from the media about how to transform ourselves and others. B ut, where can we find the criteria for what constitutes a change in the right direction? In the past, we turned mainly to religions which were accepted in our loc al culture. But, now we are reaping a harvest of cultural options of values, ideals, and paths . We can only conclude that orthodox religions have failed to provide an adequate container for many individual's experiences. Psychology, while it has made much progress since the discovery of the uncons cious by Freud, has added to the confusion by presenting many conflicting theorie s. Also, it is subject to fads, such as Satanic Panic, False Memory Syndrome, and Inne r Child, (what about the Adult?). One of the first schisms occurred be tween Freud and his star pupil Carl Jung. He broke with Freud because he could not acc ept the basic Freudian doctrine of repressed infant sexuality. Jung developed his own theories concerning the collective unconscious and its relationship to each person's personal unconscious. The personal unconsc ious comes from one's individual experiences, while the collective unconscious is an inherited legacy of all mankind. Basically, Jung's psychology stressed the quest or search for meaning. The \"search for meaning\" or meaningful experience is something we can all relate to as being valuable in, and of, itself. However, seeking has degenerated into a mind boggling choice between pop psychologies and New Age nostrums. The psycho- babble is endless, and new treatments are served up like the soup de j our. Trendy therapy and spirituality is faddish, stylish, and disposable just lik e our fashions in clothing. The hard sciences have offered a never-ending series of transforming the ories of the nature of reality also. A short time ago the leading Theory of Everything was based on Superstrings, but that became ungainly and unaesthetic mathematic ally. Now the darling is scalar physics and the vacuum potential. Physics has moved its microcosmic threshold into the realm of the unobservable virtual reality -- the domain of metaphysics. Quantum Cosmology isn't far behind. Astrophysicists w ill tell you that the only galaxy we are sure is made of matter is our own, because the light emitted by antimatter is no different from that emitted by matt er.

We can only conjecture that Post Quantum Mechanics wou ld make him roll over in his grave. As recently as the 18th century an individual might be able to comprehe nd most branches of the arts and sciences. These were the times when the mec hanistic models prevailed, including classical theories concerning space and tim e. In the 19th century this changed radically due to the speculations of the late 18th cent ury philosopher Hume. He ushered in empirical, skeptical, non-metaphys ical thinking which inspired the work of many revolutionary scientists, and dispelle d age-old superstitions. A few examples of this triumph of the rational mind over the pre-rational superstition includes the following: Charles Lyell in earth hist ory; Darwin in organic evolution; Claude Bernard in general physiology; Pasteur in pathogenesi s; Marx, Engles, Herbert Spenser and other in social sciences; Hughlings Jackson and Charles Sherrington in neurophysiology;; Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke in neuroanatomy; Camillo Golgi in neurohistology; James, Freud and Jung in psychology; and James Clerk Maxwell in physics. There has been an explosion of information about the nature of things. Any self - respecting individual is expected to know much of it, plus have a highly developed emotional IQ. We all need a model, or worldview, through which existence and our experienc es can make some sense. The vast diversity of such views produced by human cul ture discloses some arbitrary factors in the construction of these world view s. Our beliefs are subject to many formatory influences. And for the seeker the scop e of the problem of finding a Way that resonates with themselves may seem overwhelm ing. What is required is a comprehensive paradigm, or thought-model, which has sc ope and depth enough to contain the entire continuum of creation from All to N othing. This is where the value of Qabala comes in. The qabalistic techniques were developed in remote antiquity for st imulating latent, or subconscious abilities, with the aim of self-realization and God-reali zation. A personal program of spiritual development allows an individual to transfor m himself according to a consistent, orderly process. A self-directed ind ividual can recreate himself as an integrated individual. By facilitating internal p rocesses of creativity, we release our optimal talents and realize our potential for sel f-unfolding. The Qabala, with its most important diagram, the Tree of Life, provides a synergetic background for this process of change. Qabala is extremely relevant to the average reader who is seeking greater self-awareness of objective and su bjective worlds. To this end, the format of THE HOLISTIC QABALA can serve as a lifetime study guide. In recent history, we have tended to become very specialized in our field s, narrowing the fields of endeavor. For example, in the field of psycholo gy we now have such rare breeds as ethologists, neuroethologists, sociobiologists, behavi oral"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"neurologists, physiological psychologists, biological psychiatrists, psychopharmacologists, behavioral geneticists, etc. The late Buckminster Fuller suggested that universities and spec ializations evolved to keep the most intelligent under control. Rulers thus limited t heir subjects' knowledge by directing them into specialties. This prevented them f rom piecing together the exploitive procedures of the sovereign and formenting revol ution. The sovereigns then promptly exploited the specialized knowledge of the e xperts. To find meaning in our modern lives, we need to make a continuing effort to le arn about the worlds within and without us--to be generalists--like th e old natural philosophers. There is still a lot of superstition in our culture, and e ven the New Age has a distinctly anti-scientific, pre-rational orientation. There are bot h values and limitations in science and technology. But rather than reject them, we ne ed to extend their usefulness to ourselves. We can integrate them in our qab alistic study program. In this manner we may at least learn something about each aspect of li fe, and become more well-rounded in our interests, attitudes, and expres sions. We need to balance the pursuits of the mind with the experiences of s oul. The importance of the soul was eclipsed historically for a time due to the rati onal, empirical attitudes of science. But now there is a melding. This is app arent, for example, in such works as THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE: How Quantum Physics Proves the Existence of the Soul, by Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D. The realm of Depth Psychology examines the inner self of the 'psyche' w hich means not only what is generally called soul, but all the conscious and unconscious processes. Contents which can be raised from unconsciousness are know n as 'preconscious.' There are two broad divisions of the unconscius--per sonal and collective. The Collective Unconscious contains the primal patterns of the behavior, or archetypes. Known in the past as Gods and Goddesses, these forces are t he inhabitants of the mythic realm. In Depth Psychology the archetype of personal growth and spiritual developme nt is known as the Self. In Magick, it is called the inner self, or higher self. I t is the transcendent function, the center of the transformative process of \"c oming to wholeness.\" All other archetypes are contained within it, as a series of unions of opposites. The Self unites and harmonizes such opposites as masculine/femi nine; good/bad; hero/adversary, etc. It also contains the patterns for experience of the cycl ic nature of life's crisis points. Its contents include the quest for meanin g and the cycle of death and rebirth. Containing everything, it represents the maximal poten tial of any individual. The Self provides an inner model of oneself in an idealized future. I t confers initiations of the highest value through self-organizing experiences, be yond our conscious understanding or manipulation. It is mode of transcending the mundane world. Therefore, Self is both transcendent and personal. This gives divin e worth to"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"each individual manifestation of human nature, and dignity to everyone's pers onal experience. Experience of the Self is validating. The archetypes, symb olized by the Self, shape and define human behavior, attitudes, thoughts, beliefs, emoti ons, and the very body itself. Depth psychology has employed the descriptors of the ancient metaphysical p ractice of alchemy. Alchemy was a process/goal of self transformation with the aim of creating a series of unions of the various contending psychic substances. T hese descriptive phases are useful for linking Depth Psychology to the prac tice of Qabala as they further define the criteria of each synergetic stage. Pursuits like alchemy, astrology, Qabala and their corresponding imagery provide access to the messages and meanings coming into consciousness from the collective unconscious. Learning to use any of them is like learning a foreign language, and just as useful. Jung himself stressed the primacy of imagery in his pract ice: \"Images are the only reality we apprehend directly; they are the primary expression of mind and of its energy which we cannot know except through the images it presents.\" The Qabala, with the Tree of Life provides a meaningful, consistent patte rn for perceiving the visible and invisible Universe. Through it we have a means of classifying all types of experiences we are capable of having, including ph ysical, emotional, mental and spiritual. It provides a philosophical basis for inves tigating the spectrum of human potential and achievement. The goal of the process of Qabalistic pathworking is to produce Masters. The mas ter of the Qabala is a perfect person, a role model for us all. He lives harmony by bei ng himself, most perfectly. The Zaddik is highly individual, but always a paragon of ethical virtue, and impeccable in wisdom and understanding. He teaches h is students how to immerse themselves in the divine stream, like most mystical traditions ultimately finding union with God. Qabala is a theistic meditation practice. A state of total realization is cre ated through synergetically balancing and raising the consciousness of the aspi rant up through all the levels of Existence represented by the Tree of Life. Ul timately, one merges back into the source. Qabala provides both training and direct expe rience. Once the theories are learned, they must be put into practice. QBL de scribes the Creation from Nothing to Everything in one fell swoop. It is an analogue model of the Absolute. The experienced qabalist gains an understanding of his limitations and pe rceptions of reality, enabling his consciousness to contemplate the Truth of Existe nce, an expansive vision. If it is God's Will and Grace, he becomes an exemplar amon g men, a role model for realization of both human potential and mystical attainmen t. The Jews called such a person a Zaddik , or Saint.

"},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION The mystical system known as the Qabala or QBL, originated in the Hebrew culture. For the Jews, practice of the Qabala meant systematically working on eself up the Tree of Life in an attempt at re-unification with God. The Tree of Life, with its ten spheres and twenty-two paths provides a map of the inner realms. I t gives the aspirant a means of orienting in imaginal space, as well as a system of initiating an d classifying mystical experiences. As the Hebrew culture came into contact with those of the Near East an d Europe, there was a fusion of Qabalistic thought and concepts with those of other nat ions. This fusion ultimately included Egyptian, Gnostic, Christian, and Or iental elements. The practices of alchemy, astrology and magic were corresponded with the processes represented on the Tree of Life. Jews began teaching Qabala to gen tiles during the Inquisition, because they anticipated slaughter. The evolution of this eclectic system culminated in the Eighteenth an d Nineteenth Centuries in the formation of such groups as the Rosicrucians, Masons, Theosophists and The Order of the Golden Dawn. These groups synthesiz ed the disparate elements of the western mystical tradition into a coherent w hole. In establishing the Hermetic Qabala, these philosophers clarified th e techniques of self-development practiced during the Renaissance. These doctrin es came to Europe through translations by Ficinio, from ancient manuscripts. The pope com missioned the translations. There was a paradigm shift from will-power to active imagi nation, and a renaissance of the mythical. With the advent of Freud and Jung, the theory of magical development could be restated in psychological terms. Even though engaging in dramatic episodes i n an imaginal \"netherworld,\" the magician also understands himself to be deali ng with aspects of his inner Self. A primary concept in Hermetic Qabala is encoded in the famous axiom, \" As Above/So Below .\" This includes the idea that each human is a diminutive representation of the entire cosmos. Man is a microcosmic represent ation of the entire process of creation. We find this notion reflected in the mod ern holistic movement, and notions of a holographic universe. Emphasis is on the integral nature of our participation in nature and existence. The desire for psych ological wholeness and experience of an integration of the self with all creations is common to both Hermetic magical practice and the holistic psychological orientati on. The Tree of Life provides a map for the journey into the unconscious or transpersonal realm. It provides conceptual categories for taking informat ion from diverse sources and ordering it. But we must not confuse the map with the territory, which the psyche, itself. The Qabala is the traditional model for descri bing states of mystical experience, but the method of accessing these realms is acti ve magical"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"aspiration and meditation. There is a melding of will conscious attention , or seeking with the archetypal realm of the psyche. The Spheres of the Tree of Life graphically depict the discrete stat es of consciousness available to the soul. The Paths of the Tree represent the psychological transition states between them. They are the means of moving fr om \"point A to point B\" synergetically. Taken together, the spheres and paths e xpress all modes of \"being\" and \"becoming\" possible in human existence. In THE HOLISTIC QABALA, the soul-field (represented by the Tree of Life) is considered as the Reality which underlies all perceptual reality. O ur senses actually function as \"filters\" which prevent us from experiencing a more int egrated awareness of existence. Mystics say that ultimately the soul must even d isengage itself from its relationship with the mind, which also distorts soul' s pure existence. But this self-realization of the unencumbered soul is an extremel y advanced state. In the meantime, the Qabala provides a paradigm or thought-model for the aspirant. The holistic nature of the Qabala is realized through the system of correspondences, whereby diverse symbols are categorized and ordered. An example of the correspondence system is the underlying unity between the Sphere Tiphareth, the Sun in astrology, gold in alchemy, and the godforms Christ, Mith ras, and the archetype \"magickal childe.\" It would also include characteris tic colors, plants, stones, and inner experiences of psychological transmutation. The H olistic Qabala is a sort of unified field theory disclosing the underlying matrix of both consciousness (or psyche) and matter. The alchemical analogy is the Unus Mundus , or One World. Areas included in this correspondence with the ten spheres of the Tree of Life are: philosophy, psychology, physics, mythology, astrology, Tarot, and alchemy. In The Holistic Qabala, a basis is provided through which these separate areas of st udy relate through a common theme. Practical applications are provided for each mode of consciousness and tr ansition- state presented. Through elaboration from diverse fields of human endeavor , a comprehensive concept of each Sphere is built. The reader develops a \" feel\" for the meaning of each sphere and path. This non-dogmatic approach forms a basis for your own speculations and experiencing. It is an orientation. A series of psychological models for moving into and through various stages are suggested. This work pays particular attention to the corresponding deities of th e different centers. This is not intended to create any conflicts in monotheistic readers, but is a convenient way of classifying psychological forces. In ancient times these universal forces were known as gods and goddesses. So this terminology is retained for expediency. We come to realize \"the many through the One,\" or \"the One t hrough the many.\" To know God directly is an overwhelming proposition, but we can integrate discrete aspects, through relationships and identification ."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"The experience of these archetypal encounters with aspects of the S elf is presented as an on-going part of daily life, not just confined the ritual-space. If we pay attention to it, we can \"see through\" our mundane experiences to the imagin al realm of the gods and goddesses. This is Astral vision. There is a unificati on of mundane and spiritual life, mediated by the soul. Sections on astrology and alchemy allow access to the common core of meaning between QBL and other metaphysical disciplines. The meaning of the var ious planetary forces are fleshed-out as they are personified. These dynamic for ces of the unconscious relate to the conscious ego via symbols and imagery. When we have learned the parameters or field-of-influence of these deities, w e have gained the ability to recognize and discriminate among them. Most importantly, we have tak en up a conscious relationship with them. Each chapter culminates in a valuable exercise for grounding in the stat e of consciousness under consideration. They are designed to provide both exp eriential and conceptual understanding. It is important for psychological balance t hat intellectual cognition keeps pace with spiritual experience. Toget her, cognitive and affective development open the Middle Way. THE FOUR WORLDS OF QBL: The Qabalistic worldview divides Creation into four levels of existenc e: 1. Assiah, the Physical Plane (Sphere 10) 2. Yetzirah, the Emotional plane (Spheres 7, 8, 9) 3. Briah, the Intellectual Plane (Spheres 4, 5, 6) 4. Atziluth, the Spiritual Plane (Spheres 1, 2, 3) 1. THE PHYSICAL PLANE has been described as a pendant on the glyph of the T ree of Life. Actually, it is de-pendent upon the formative processes of the H igher Planes. It represents the entire physical world of corporeal matter, incl uding the human body. It manifests distress in psychosomatic symptoms. The influence of the archetypes is projected into material form. The physical plane is the lo st accessible region of the subconscious. Just because events are real doesn't mean they are a content of consciousness. This can't occur until you can plumb the psych ic depths, deliteralize, and see the archetypal core behind man-I-festation. T his is the condition of \"normal\" ego-consciousness, prior to undertaking the spirit ual quest. 2. THE EMOTIONAL PLANE has a physical analogy known in science as electromagnetic fields. In the past it was called the Astral Light or As tral Plane. Psychologically, it is the world of images and their affects. This is where archetypes are perceived in images or mind-pictures; often this means only a vague awar eness or foreboding. This is also the realm of dream and divination. The Astral Bod y is the vehicle of travel in this plane. Here, both godforms and matter (Maya) are visible. This is the lunar plane of psychics and mediums; it influe nces the body"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"through the parasympathetic nervous system or the central nervous system . Its negative expression is over-emotionalism. 3. THE INTELLECTUAL PLANE marks the upper limit of the mind's i nfluence on spiritual effort. Beyond this area, there is neither mind nor matter. I n order to journey to these higher realms, the soul must dissolve its knot with th e mind, and ascend by the magnetic attraction of God's holy Word. This is the region of psychological conceptions concerning archetypes. The aspirant not only has visi ons of archetypes or godforms, he recognizes these forms or forces when he see s them, and has creative, dialogical relationships with them. He learns to project h is will through the visualization of images. This is a function of the rational mind, p ut to spiritual use. This is the geometrical realm of the Causal Body, termed t he Body of Light by mystics. To psychologists, it is a crystallization of the archetype of the Self. This stage reflects self-realization or perfect equilibration. Th e mind manifests negatively in neurosis. 4. THE SPIRITUAL PLANE of existence is that which is inhabited by t he archetypal patterns or matrix patterns before they begin to descend into material manifestation. Their bodies are the lineaments along which the lower planes crystallize. To reach this plane, all form is sacrificed. This is the pr e-geometrical plane of \"information.\" Awakened souls and Masters have the ability to travel at will and merge with this World of the Divine. This higher faculty allows them to see that all the archetypal impulses or forces exist without spatial separat ion. Each 'plane' is a new modality without spatial separation. The archetypal world c annot be conceived of in images, nor the concepts of the mind. It is the experienc e of final reunion which makes man and God complete. [Geometrical construction of the Tree of Life]"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"The Abyss is another landmark described by mystics as part of the inner journey. It is a large expanse of utter darkness lying between the Intellectual Plan e and the Archetypal Plane. It marks the line of demarcation between the Int ellectual Plane and the Archetypal Plane. It marks the line of demarcation between th e primal forces of creation and the formation of phenomena. It is said to contain a sort of spiritual island, or resting spot. In QBL, it is called DAATH, and is cons idered a gateway to another dimension. In Eastern systems, it is called Anchit Dip. Described in terms of man's spiritual development, it marks the t ransition in spiritual practice from using procedures to move one's self higher (s elf-realization) to receiving the downpour of God's divine Grace (God-realization). From this point, one cannot advance through personal effort alone. There is a complementary \"reaching down\" by the higher forces to meet the soul \"half way.\" The Abyss is a dangerous place because, here, there is both an upward tend ency and a lower tendency. The lower tendency has to do with the subconscious mind of God (Universal Mind), and its perversity and negative manifestations. The tem ptation is to remain at self-realization worshipping one's Self. This leads to dege neration. Universal Mind is the final trap for the aspirant, as it seeks to entrap the soul in its time-bound realm. One can get lost for eternity in the depths of this transcendent imagination with No Exit. By attaching oneself to the upward tendency, spiritual secrets are reveal s to the soul, and the knot with the mind is dissolved. A god-realized Master who init iates the aspirant during his lifetime aids this process. He then functions as a soul-guide, ferrying the soul across the Abyss, with the assurance of safety. He is attache d to the Lord or the Light, and if you are attached to him, you can follow by living his teachings. Remember, no teacher can take you to realms higher than he has experienced. For the most progress, it is expedient to find a God-reali zed Master. This manual describes the Spheres and connecting Paths of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life. Many other magical texts are available describing the basics of Q BL, and the student is advised to familiarize himself with them. The Holi stic Qabala, however, presents a series of essays in a modularized format. The reader may pick and choose among them for subjects of immediate intere st. The book may be studied and re-read to increase comprehension. It is a comp lete course and can be re-read with benefit many times. Also, you will be refe rred to other sections of the work, which may further define a given topic. A spiritual science is developed by synthesizing concepts from the past with trends in current research. The Spheres and Paths are defined in practical, c ontemporary terms through the corresponding contents of the chapters. Each chapte r is divided into four sections which relate to the planes as follows: 1. Archetypal (Spiritual) Plane = Philosophy 2. Intellectual (Causal) Plane = Psychology"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"3. Emotional (Astral) = Astrology and Alchemy 4. Physical Plane = Orientation/Exercise Each plane contains an entire Tree of Life within it, which resonate s with the other planes.

The linear, or sequential development in which runs throug hout the chapters, traces the path of hierarchical development in the consciou sness of the adept. Included under the term \"consciousness\" are both the rational e go- consciousness, and the diffuse anima-consciousness of the soul, whic h is prior in existence to the emergence of the ego, and persists after it has merged.

Malkuth is the corporeal sphere of Earth. The basis of any stable magickal development is the maintanance of physical health through proper diet and exercise. Wrong diet, especially eating at inappropri ate times, is a major cause of physical, emotional, and mental imbalance. Opinions differ on whether man's natural diet should include me at. But most meat is full of steroids and antibiotics that accumulate and cause harm to the body. What se rious aspirant would want to kill and living creatures for food or sport? Is that not a lack of compassion? Advantages of a meatless die include lower incidence of har dening of the arteries, less uric acid, and chemical intake.

As the connecting link between malkuth and Yesod, Path 32 graphically depi cts how space/time connects EM fields to matter. Path 32 is the first path encountered when the aspirant is initiated in to the Way of Return up the Tree of Life. It is a path of equilibrium, since it is found on the Middle Pillar. It represents the beginning and perfection of the Great Work. 1. Physical Plane: Melancholy and anxiety with fantasies of regeneration and rejuvination.

Astral Plane: The strongest image for this path is a descent into the un derworld. It is the beginning stage of mystical soul travel, during which one concen trates on development of the astral body. This facilitates the experiencing of reali ty through psychic senses, which are metaphorical perceptions through the agenc ies of sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing. These so-called ESP phenomenon do not requi re the introduction of a new sense, but only this new metaphorical mode of apprehending through those with which we are familiar. This plane of Path 32 also represents the beginnings of devotional mysticism. Also included is t he concept of karma, and the mating instinct. The combination of these two leads to the c oncept of the soul-mate, who cannot be found until this plane is experienced. Cl airvoyance. 3. Causal Plane: The stability confered by Saturn through this path helps p romote concentration, particularly in relationship to images. These images arise spontaneously in the Astral Plane, and percolate through to normal ego- consciousness through this Path, with varying amounts of distortion. Focused concentration eliminates fuzziness. Both magick and psychoanalysis provid e the means for focusing and following images through their transformations i nto an equilibrated state in Tiphareth (#6). Insight. 4. Archetypal Plane: Space/time creates certain limitations or bound ary conditions of both human physical and psychic existence. Acceptance of these condit ions and the form it produces are necessary for realization. With persistence, it is possible to attain perfection through rejuvination. There is harmony among the Chakras of t he physical body (CNS and endocrines). This produces a cosmic consciusne ss and a yearning for further experiences of soul travel on the path to God-Realizat ion. Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is relevant. PART II: YETZIRAH.

The Moon exemplifies the n otion of dynamic equilibrium; it builds a firm foundation of stability based on cyclic change. This ebb and flow is characteristic of the Feminine Ms.teries and Lunar Magic. Emo tional-sexual sphere. The Moon of Yesod symbolizes fertility of body, soul, mind, and imagination. Its manifestation range from reflective and purely automatic impulses of ge neration to providing a source of inspiration. This fluctuating world of shape-shift ing forms is know in mythology as ISIS, the Great Mother who contains all otherr goddesses. She re presents the archetypal virginity of the feminine aspect of Godhead, its all-encompassin g receptivity. The characteristic experience of Yesod or the lower astral plane is a tranc e state of varying depth. Most commonly, ego, memory and control are weak or absent. There is diss ociation from an ordinary state of consciusness. If memory of the imagery experience i s retained, it may be misinterpreted or distorted, resulting in no effective assim ilation into daily life. This is the disrete state where channeling phenomena occur. Receptivity is the keyword for Yesod, which in the Four Worlds is represented by the following: 1. Physical Plane: In the phenomenal world Yesod is characterized as electromagnetic fields, known by physicists to be the formative bas is of matter. In the human body, the genitals represent Yesod.

It provides no access past the Astral Plane. Its negative effects i nclude superstition, overemotionalism or reactiveness. Astral psychism. Indep endence; idleness. 3. Causal Plane: From the psychological perspective, Yesod is the realm of Imagination and Archetypes. One may experience it through Trance or various A rt forms. There is understanding of the contrasexual aspects of the anima and an imus. There is release from possession and enhanced control of emotions through employing the imaginative technique of personification of divine forces. 4.

It relates es pecially to academic and intellectual matters. Development of this Sphere enhances one's ab ility to communicate clearly and honestly. You are able to transmit your messages and ideas to others so t hat they are received without distortion. Multi-level communication inc ludes intelligibility and gut-feeling awareness.

Netzach is the Sphere which embodies the inspirational force of the creative imagination. It signifies the achievement of perfection in both force and form. It also i mplies emotional perfection of the consciousness, through understanding of the inner m eaning of physical processes (the sexual instinct, in particular). Therefore, Netzach is functional in the establishment in the person ality of values and ideals. A purpose of spiritual development of this sphere is to learn the distinction between ideal love and human love. Aphrodite, the beautiful naked woman, represents the Anima, or soul. Sh e is man's idea of the idealized fantasy, who would make his life complete, providing him w ith psychological wholeness through no effort of his own. When this archetype is project ed in human relationships onto a mortal woman, there is certain disappointment to follo w, unless a mature relationship can be developed. A spiritual goal of netzach is, there fore, the internalization of this anima projection, which then functions as a guid e to the inner realms of the subconscious. 1. Physical Plane: Attractiveness, beauty. Centripetal forces; that whi ch pulls toward the center. Internalization. An ascetic life-style. 2. Astral Plane: Emotion, passion, feeling. Romantic love; in courtly love, one is caught in a medieval psychological attitude which confounds divine and human love. Projection of religious attitudes onto the love one in worshipful adultat ion may end in an emotionally withdrawn individual who is extremely sorrowful and dissatisfied. When the rush of being \"in love\" evaporates, one seeks to re kindle the dynamics of the archetypal situation through transferring the projecti on onto yet another person. One has the ability to attract others, but not to maintain stab le relationships. Unselfishness; lust, promiscuity. 3. Causal Plane: With developing emotional sensitivity, one does not burden the partner by making her/him carry the projection of the Goddess/God. We take responsibility for our own unlivied life of the soul. We take up a discip lined relationship to the Anima or Animus; we learn to love both our ideal vision an d our human partner, without confusing the value and function of each. This brings an increase in stability to all human relationships. Through commitment to an individual (with full consciousness of their shadow nature) the re is acceptance of the mundane aspects of day-to-day life, rather than continual yearning to externaliz e the idealized vision of perfection. 4.

Art forms include dance, ddrama, music, painting, ceremini al magick, alchemy, perfumery, sculpture, poetics, etc. As \"Art,\" Path 25 presents us with a new quality in our vision of reality. Th is is the realm of metaphorms, where our brain images reality and the universe in its own st ructural terms. This surreal vision attempts to portray the working of the subconsc ious mind. In QBL, it is considered the narrow way between Death and The Devil, trial and temptation. The artiste attempts to balance his inner turmoil through a transformi ng \"Work\" or \"Opus.\" History is replete with examples of this often painful proces s. But it can be joyful also. 1. Physical Plane: Path 25 represents both a physical and psychological harmon izing or equilibrating process, in which instability is balanced through dis ciplined work. It is a blending of opposites, culminating in unification and transformati on through will. It indicates the reversability or sublimation of instinctual e nergies. Included are the performing arts, especially ceremonial or High Magick, with its blen ding of the energies of Sun and Moon. This process is designed to establish contac t with the Self. 2. Astral Plane: The image for this card represents the exchange of male an d female energies between husband and wife.

This has nothing t o do with the \"hollow earth\" theory, but means to plumb the depths of the subconscious by urning inward.

All that is metaphysical is synergetic. (B. Fuller, 1976) In our approach to true self-knowledge via the Tree of Life, we begin with Malkuth, the Sphere of Eart h, the Four Elements, and the Physical Body. At this initi al point on the Path of Return, we seek the wisdom of nature and develop a zealous dedication to the prin ciples of the Great Work. We come to understand the value and necessity of placing our self-unfoldment as our main priority. Everything in nature desires to return to its root, and our soul desires attachment to its Root on high in Kether. But mysticism is not meant for everyone, and only e arnest seekers will continue to be motivated. When w e know we are in the dark, we begin to consciously se ek the Light. To climb the spiritual ladder, we asc end from one qabalistic Universe to the one above it, f rom the physical to astral to causal to archetypal. We attach our mind to that which is on high--attachment to th e spiritual. If you wish to ascend, you must go fro m one stage to the next, holistically incorporating more levels of awareness as you go. To begin, a basic understanding of physics, physiol ogy, chemistry, botany and biology is helpful. We ge t to know the scientific basis of reality before we delv e into the metaphysical. This is the realm of empir icism and phenomenology. We begin with the things of the world , the things that can be perceived by our senses. O ur study replaces ignorance of these subjects, and hel ps us overcome magical superstitions about \"how thi ngs work.\" The Holy Grail of science is the Grand Unified Theo ry of Everything. We study the objective universe, realizing that all theories about its nature are st ill hypothetical. As in the case of all observation s, our senses are prone to distortions, and we need to learn abou t the limitations of our sensory apparatus, as well as tricks our mind can play on us. Biofeedback is effective f or learning biophysical control; neuralfeedback tea ches control of brainwave states. Through all these mean s we seek to understand the apparently hidden laws of material existence. Everything we can know about our experience comes t o us through sensory experience or our mental senso ry impressions of these sensations. Experiential metap hors--what experiences are like--are always clothed in quasi-sensory metaphors of sight, sound, feeling, e tc. All our understanding of the laws of life is gr asped through this sensory modality. Through practice and study we can cultivate a more accurate interpretat ion of"},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"inner sense reports. We develop our ability to conce ntrate or focus attention, which prepares us for mo re subtle understanding. Learning about the physical plane through science h elps us prepare intellectually for the direct exper ience of the essential unity of all things. The formation of the universe and its continual unfolding is a grea t mystery. At the most fundamental levels, the differences bet ween organic and inorganic matter vanish. Thus ther e is an underlying unity to mineral, plant, animal, and human makeup. The primary forms of energy in physics are radiatio n, fluids, gases, and solids. Ancient symbolism ref ered to them as fire, water, air, and earth. These four ele ments are assigned to Malkuth, as they form the bas is of physical reality. Malkuth means the Kingdom, and ev erything in the kingdom is a combination of these primary forms of matter, which is more fundamentall y energy, always in motion. However, primal Light or Spirit is the primary subs tance of every form. Matter can be considered somew hat like \"frozen\" or crystallized light. Spirit is in M atter and reflects the qabalistic aphorism \" Kether is in Malkuth .\" It is a materio-spiritual Creation. Gradually we learn to perceive this directly as our consciousne ss ascends the stations of the Tree of Life, from oute r appearances to their inner Reality. The work of t his sphere includes turning outward observations into i nward insights. We learn to ground the force of the spirit in daily life. Limitations in perception give way to the cla rity which comes from an informed and experienced position. We can engage in any activity when we realize nothing but God's presence in it. Life becomes a meditation, th e practice of the presence of God. At this stage of re-dedication, we should reevaluat e our attitude toward our body, making sure to give it the essential love and care which will enable us to con tinue the work of transformation. There are ordeals and periods of great tension in the work when pairs of opposites within us are attempting to reconcile. A strong immune system is helpful at this time, since the te nsion is physically tangible, adding to any normal load of stress. Properly prepared and conditioned (such as through yoga or Tai Chi), the body will subconsciously coop erate in the Great Work. The chakras symbolize six planes of subtle matter in the body which are material for ces. Engaging in worldly activities, our mind is fixed o n spirituality. Following the advice of old qabalis tic masters, we afix our mind to each physical thing, e levating and binding it on high. When we cannot gras p a difficult subject we are at the level of Malkuth, b ut when we follow through and grasp it, our underst anding binds it to Binah and attaches the two together. God can be found in all things, even our pain and s truggles. When we realize this, we can remove the ga rment of our physicality and let our soul and spirit soar , by attaching it to God through meditation. Then w e come to see the Divine Presence in all things. The whole earth becomes filled with the radiance of the Divi ne Presence, and this raises or elevates our thoughts from the lower world to the transcendental realm. M an is a microcosm, and True Light is within us. The infinit e is contained in the finite. Our body, the mortal frame is a house for the soul. The Sephiroth are the Divine Emanations which God c reated to direct the universe. Meditate that God is in front of you in the 10 Spheres of that Universe, an d contemplate that infinite greatness. All spheres come together in the lowest one which is Malkuth. It is associated with the Divine Presence, or immanence o f God, known in Kabbalah as the Shekinah, in-dwelling femi nine counterpart of God.. This is why Malkuth is ca lled \"The Bride.\" The very elements of our bodies were born in the ex plosion of some supernova long ago. Our carbon atom s, molecules, the various minerals and salts in our bo dy are obviously fundamental to our existence. We co nvert plant matter into ourselves through a process of co ld fusion we call digestion. In our meditation we c an include in our self-concept the animal, vegetable a nd mineral universes, and through that meditation b ind them all to God. The next stage is to ascend to the First Firmament (The Universe path), ascending with the soul alone, separating yourself from the body, \"divesting the p hysical.\" Expand the firmament on all sides until i t fills your whole mind and climb until you reach the world of Angels (Yetzirah, YESOD), and then the world of the Throne (Briah, Tiphareth). Every stage looks final, until it is transcended. E very plane appears to be the very last, since that is as far as our vision can penetrate. Many schools of meditatio n confuse Universal Mind, which is clearly a causal experience, with the Supreme Deity. Every stage con tains false copies of the highest spiritual stages, subtle planes of transcendent worlds. When we focus on a definite purpose, we override all automatic responses that tend to destroy it. So it is in meditation when the body would draw our consciousne ss down with itches, pains, involuntary movement an d"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"other distracting sensations. If we continue to foc us we become transparent and all elemental forces i n the body are purified. Rest and patience, and many ascents and descents in meditations are required to establish new patterns in the physical body. Spiritual experiences must be digest ed or assimilated to gain their full value, and we must not \"lust for results.\" The results are on-going even w hen imperceptible, if we remain punctual in our meditation. When we can still the body and the senses and collec t our consciousness at the Eye Center, we can cross the realm of the stars (Path 32, the Universe) at the t hreshold of the Astral Plane to move toward the inn er Sun and illumination of the Causal Plane. But progress is one small step at a time. In Malkuth, we identify with what has come to be kn own as Gaia-consciousness. Expanding our awareness to that of the earth's biosphere we learn compassion f or all life forms. This leads many to choose a vege tarian lifestyle, since 6-10 vegetarians can live on the r esources consumed by one omnivore. Another consider ation is the population explosion which threatens the whole ecology, so responsible breeding also becomes a consideration. We may not be able to heal the planet , but we can improve our personal relationship with it by responsible choices such as recycling and low-impac t lifestyles. Malkuth, as the sphere of physical sensation, incit es to action. Alchemically, this has four phases. T he earthy phase is our recognition of our ignorance and delus ions, which allows us to seek wisdom. The watery ph ase is one of purification from emotional colorations. Fir e refers to mental activation, wherein we dedicate our reasoning and analytical faculties to the earnest s earch for truth. The airy aspect, or stage of incan descence, marks the enlightenment of the Astral. But remember , the densest forms of earth are essentially one wi th the Light.

A tetrahedral unity moddels everything. As a four-fold object, it is simply the minimum structural system in the Universe. It is s tability incarnate, a nest of principles. A cross-legged med itator forms a tetrahedron. According to Fuller: \"There is a fourfold twoness: one of the exterior, cosminc, finite (\"nothingness\") tetrahedron--i.e. t he macrocosm outwardly complementing all (\"something\") systems--and one of the interior microcosmic tetrahedron of nothingness complementing all concep tually thinkable and cosmically isolatable \"somethi ng\" systems.\" (Synergetics 2, 223.07) \"Omnidirectional Halo\""},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"The Quest we initiate as seekers in Malkuth is not without its consequences, according to P.D.

They are \"strong\" force, \"weak\" force,"},{"pageNumber":865,"pageContent":"electromagnetism, and gravity. \"Strong\" force holds the nucleus of the ato m together, contributing to the stability of matter; \"weak\" force occurs in many natu ral processes, but the most familiar is radioactive decay. Malkuth is the Sphere of Earth. The basis of any stable magickal development is a maintenance of physical heal th through proper diet and exercise. Wrong diet, especially eating at inappropriate time s is a major cause of physical, emotional, and mental imbalance. Opinions differ on whether man's natural diet should include me at. However, what serious aspirant would want to kill any living creature for food or sport? The advantage s of a meatless diet include a lower incidence of hardening of the arteries , and less uric acid, steroid, and antibiotic consumption. Supplements of vitamin B-12, brewer' s yeast, lecithin, and minerals will ensure optimal physical and mental performance. Stress management programs have received a lot of media attention, lately. The b est stress management programs consist of a combination of physical exercise and medit ation. One works on the sympathetic nervous system, and the other on the parasympatheti c system. Development of body-awareness is important for \"coming to wholeness.\" Ther e are many techniques to choose from. A disciplined physical fitness routine might include any of the following: aerobics, \"chopping wood and carrying water,\" Tai Chi, hatha yoga, or dance . In the four worlds, Malkuth is represented by these correspondence s: 1. Physical Plane: The four natural forces. Resonance. Sensory awareness. Diet and exercise. Level of observation in Physics; matter 2. Astral Plane: The Magickal Image is a Young Woman, Crowned and Throned, who is Demeter/Persephone, a dual form of the Goddess. She is at once Earth Mother and her daughter (the Kore), the archetypal maiden. This young bri de becomes the Queen of the Underworld, or subconcious. 3. Causal Plane: The Personal Unconscious includes the memories and re pressed material which must be raised to consciousness. These conflicts mus t be resolved before one is ready to confront the Collective Unconscious. These repres sed contents require a specific technique designed to \"raise\" them. 4. Archetypal Plane: Initiation into a Mystery has to do with \" initium ;\" an image of \"going within, suddenly,\" as in the abduction of Persephone into the Un derworld, below the threshold of consciousness.

INTRODUCTION In our approach to true self-knowledge, via the Tree of Life, we begin wit h Malkuth, the Sphere of the Earth, the Four Elements, and the Physical Body. At this point we seek the wisdom of nature and develop a zealous dedication to the principles of the G reat Work. We come to understand the value and necessity of placing our self-unfoldme nt as our main priority. \"To do this we must begin with the things of this world; the things that can be perceived with the physical senses. ...The objective universe and all it contains are t he initial subjects of occult study.\" To this end a knowledge of physics and physiology are basic. We seek an understanding of the apparently hidden laws of material existence. \"Everything of knowledge we possess comes to us through sense experie nce and our mental impressions of these sensations. Whatever of the laws of life we grasp mu st be apprehended in this way.\" Through practice and study we can cultivate a more accurate interpretation"},{"pageNumber":867,"pageContent":"of inner sense reports. We develop our ability to concentrate or focus atten tion, which prepares us for more subtle understanding. \"Knowledge of the physical plane, including the findings in the field of the natural sciences, prepares us intellectually for a direct experience of the essential u nity of all the seemingly separate things in this world. Whether the body considered is that of a mi neral, plant, animal, or human being, its seemingly separate form is the result of a focus of various energies.\" \"The primary forms these energies take are classed in physics as radian t energies, fluids, gases, and solids. Ancient symbolism referred to them as fire, water, air, and e arth, the four elements assigned to Malkuth. Everything in the Kingdom is a combinat ion of various proportions of these primary forms of matter, which are in continuous mo tion.\" However, Light or Spirit is the primary substance of every form. Spirit is in matter and reflects the Qabalistic aphorism \"Kether is in Malkuth.\" Gradually we learn to perceive this directly as our consciousness rises from earth to heaven, from outer ap pearances to the inner Reality. Then we learn to ground the force of the spirit in daily lif e. Limitations in perception give way to clarity. At this stage of re-dedication we should re-evaluate our attitude toward ou r body, making sure to give it the essential love and care which will enable us to conti nue the physical reconstruction work of transformation. There are periods of great tension in the work when pairs of opposites are attempting to reconcile. A strong immune syst em is helpful at this time, since the tension is physically tangible, adding to any normal load of stress. The body will subconsciously cooperate in the Great Work. \"When attention is focused toward a definite purpose and we set a process in motion which tends to d estroy all ideas, responses and automatic activities that are not in harmony with that inten tion. When the attention or intention is directed toward becoming a servant of the Light , processes are initiated which rid us of all that stands in the way of transparency to the Superconscious Will.\" The elemental forces will work in the body, dissolving resistances, and purifying the desire nature. Rest and patience are required, for this takes time to establis h the new pattern in the physical body and become stabilized. Studying, practicing and medit ation require a process of assimilation or digestion to gain their full value. Thus, the admonit ion not to \"lust for results.\" Malkuth, as the sphere of physical sensation, incites to action. Alchemic ally, this has four phases. The earthy phase is our recognition of our ignorance and delusions, wh ich allows us to seek wisdom. The watery phase is one of purification from emotional col orations.

Initiation: Neophyte, (The Value and Meaning of Initiation) Initiations may be roughly divided into 3 types: shamanistic, magical, and mysti cal. The meaning of initiation arises from the death/rebirth paradox. A ritual death opens the way for a new birth, but not without the pain, awe, fear and dread of the helpless infant. Vestiges of the sacred ordeals required for initiation survive in daily li fe in such customs as hazing and mandatory army haircuts. Ritual rapes survive in panty raids. The tests of endurance, strength, ridicule, fear, humiliation, and abuse are followed by oaths of fealty, and obligations which define the aspirants purpose and inte nt. These tests produce a social bonding among members of a group. Shamanisitic initiations produce a trance state, and induce confusion , muzziness, and an inhibition of consciousness. Frequently, there is use of mind-alter ing substances from the plant world. A shamanistic initiation is best described through a first -hand account: Halloween October 31, Moon in Pisces Today, I was INITIATED in the First Degree. I am now officially an initiate an d can begin the Great Work in earnest.. The ceremony began by me having to wait naked, and in isolation, while ___________, my initiator prepared the Temple. While waiting, I meditated on the signific ance of my commitment, and prayed that I might be worthy to receive what was to come. It was the inevitable event, at that moment in my time and space. Absolutely nece ssary. I was given a cord and told to tie it around my waist. I was told the meaning of the passageway. Then I had to be blindfolded. I was asked 3 times if I was certain I wished to proceed. Of course, I answered yes without hesitation. I was led into the Temple, and at the final questioning a knife was put to my heart. I received introductions with my magical name to the powers of the four dire ctions. By this time, I was pretty involved and I can't recall precisely in what ord er things occurred. Some salt was placed in my mouth. I was consecrated by the four eleme nts. My measure was taken and given to me. I swore an oath to the Goddess and made a personal oath to devote myself wholeheartedly to the Great Work. I received my at hame and scourge. I was scourged on the back while on my knees, for forty times and received transmission of the power. Finally, I was allowed to take off the blindfold and to robe, and Lo and Behold, a new initiate appeared. There are two major branches of mysticism: magic and yoga. One enters the ci rcuit of the Tree of Life by adopting the magickal world-view, with its paradigms and mod els. The"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"aspirant makes the choice to strive for human perfection following that i nner urging which demands he elevate himself. This is where we meet the difference between psychotherapy and spiritual discipline. Psychology considers the urge to spiritual d evelopment to be \"heroic\", \"puer flight\", or \"transcendence fantasies.\" It can be all of t hese, if there is not proper, simultaneous growth of the cognitive, as if it is an analysis of the pe rsonal unconscious to determine motives. Is there a yearning desire for the soul to go to its true home with God, or is it merely a neurotic escape mechanism? There are two types of initiation left to cover here: those of the magical p ath and that of mystical yoga, or the union of the soul with the sound current. Magick requires a hierarchical series of initiations with an order, wher e the initiating officers represent dramatic projections of the various psychological fi gures which are latent in the subconscious of the aspirant. The goal of these initiations is to progressively bring the student to awareness of his divine nature, allowing him to diff erentiate among and consciously integrate his unconscious projections. Dramatic cere monies stir up the imagination. The officers represent such faculties as reason, the higher mind, the will, and the Self. It is the duty of the Hierophant to communicate the spiritu al current to the aspirant. Failure to do so does not produce a true initiation. This initiation awakens the aspirant's complexes; he confronts the m and gradually learns about the divine form they express, and comes to accept them as part of hi s wholeness. Gradually, he comes to Knowledge and Conversation with his Guardian Angel , that divine spark of the soul from God which is incarnate in an individual human bei ng. This is more than Self-Realization; it is a spiritual quest which leads him to try t o cross the Abyss. Mystics have a slightly different orientation. The first criteria is to fi nd a perfect, living Master. Remember, a teacher takes you no further than he himself has gone. A magickal initiator may be only Self-Realized, not God-Realized, as a Master is. It is fin e to honor \"ascended\" Masters of the past, but they can only care for the souls they init iated while alive. They are on the inner planes, and can be met with, but one needs a living M aster to initiate a first-hand experience of the divine Light and Sound. Who would seek a dead surgeon for needed surgery? One must seek a Master who speaks of traveling t o the highest possible experience, God-Realization. The so-called \"inner orders\" of certain magickal traditions insist upon yogic practices as an adjunct to ceremonial practic e. To find a Master and have the good fortune to become initiated is not enough. One on ly matures on the Path by the daily discipline of meditation for 2 1/2 hours pe r day. This is tithing one's time, not money. The purpose is to \"die daily\" which ult imately brings liberation from the wheel of rebirth. At death the soul goes to those inner realms it is used to traversing. It undoes its knot with the mind, and goes back to its true home w ith God (represented in Qabala as #1, Kether). There are always living Masters on the earth. You must evaluate your goals before seeking to enter any mystery school. Consider this: who is the living Master of the Egyp tian mysteries, who is the master of the Eleusinian mysteries, what are th e credentials of this Qabalistic teacher, what lineage is represented, who is a credible Arch druid, how far can"},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"Wicca take me? By choosing a teacher who can take you to the furthest region, you avoid changing disciplines in mid-stream. This means less energy wasted on fruitless practice. Teachers of magick are known by their grade: minor adept, exempt adept, mas ter of the temple, magus, ipsissimus, etc. In magick, the teacher need only be one grade higher than the student. In the Eastern systems, there is one teacher, and his initiated disci ples. But, you can also determine grade in these systems: Physical Plane: (chakras) Bhagwan. Astral Plane: (pranayam) prophets, auliyas, yogis Causal Plane: (self-realization) gyani yogis and yogiswars Archetypal Planes: (God-Realization) perfect Sadh (disciple) par amahansa (phoenix, or awakened soul) Sat Guru (Saint) Master or Param Sant Sat Guru (highes t kind of Saint who has elected to also be a teacher). Any true Master will come to his disciple shortly before death, inform hi m it is his time, and accompany him through the transition in his Radiant Form. He IS the di vine Logos or Word in its present incarnation. There can be more than one on earth at a time. Christ may have been \"the Way, the Truth, and the Light\" to his initiates, bu t THE WAY is only through the begotten Son, not through the only begotten Son. God is not stin gy. Anyone who promises salvation after death is wrong. The soul's purpose in li fe is to get a master and make such progress on the spiritual path during life that he n eed not reincarnate. So the question becomes: \"Who is a current, living Master?\" Spiritual practice requires neither outward affectations (clothe s, hairstyles, asceticism), nor abstinence from sex. The practice of ceremonial magick can be a very private aff air, and for those who prefer mysticism, there are \"householder\" yogas which go t o the highest region. The initiation in Magick for Malkuth makes the aspirant a Neophyte, a beginn er or novice. His tasks include familiarizing himself with the Astral Plane, by pr oceeding along Path 32, Tau, THE UNIVERSE. He creates his astral body for soul travel to higher real ms. b. Ritual: \"On the Practice of Ritual and Ceremony\" A potential participant in Magick might well inquire into the meaning, valu e, practice, and mode of constructing rituals. To begin, let us examine the archetypal motivat ing factor, or godform, behind the desire for ritual enactments. As a god who presides over boundaries, Hermes, the Magician, is able to transcen d them. He rules ceremonial magick. He enables us to move from one state of consci ousness to another. This brings to mind the three phases of every ritual process: 1). separation from profane or daily life;"},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"2). the transition stage, or twilight zone, which lies between; 3). the new order or perception of reality which occurs in the sacred time of the soul. The in-between, or twilight zone, enables a state of receptivity to be est ablished. Ritual acts reawaken deep layers of the psyche and bring the mythological or archetypal id eas back to memory. Though the basic or original forms of magic and schizophrenic fantasy spri ng from the same roots, they are not synonymous. Magick is, in general, the counterp hobic attitude, the transition from passivity to activity. The Will is essential. Realistic action does not follow schizophrenic magic; the fantasy is a substitute for action. Th e ego is weak or absent. Jung asserted that ritual might be an effective way of re-establishing th e experience of an inner fullness. This would be a great boon in our society where so many fee l alienated, isolated, and lonely. Magical practices are the projections of psychic events which, in cases li ke these, exert a counter influence on the soul and act like a kind of enchantment of one's own personality. That is to say, by means of these concrete performances the atten tion, or better said, the interest, is brought back to an inner sacred domain which is the source and goal of the soul. This inner domain contains the unity of life and consciousn ess which, though once possessed, has been lost and must now be found again. --C.G. Jung/ Secret of the Golden Flower How many people long for a return to the well-springs of being for an experi ence of rejuvenation? This renovation, or renewal of personality opens the doors to an inne r world, which is at least as rich and diverse as the physical world. Ritual is often considered as the celebration of a myth. Myth functions as a paradigm or model. In this school of thought, the construct of a ritual can be seen as th e enactment of this myth, as myth would be represented as the source. Myth is actually a d ynamic expression of the motivational power of the archetype at its core. Other schools believe that the ritual existed first, and the tale or myth was created from the need to account for the action that was occurring. In Magick, the former system is used because of its adaptability to Jungian psychology: the myth existed first, and then the ritual was developed around the myth. The main value of ritual is for the soul. Ritual can be defined as an imitation of a Numinous Element (or godform) in the life of the aspirant. Ritual can be seen as the ou tward or visible form of contact, or an epiphany with, an inward or spiritual grace. It i s essentially a metaphorical expression of creative imagination. The distinction between concrete and literal, so important to alchemy, is t he essential distinction in ritual. The ritual of theater, of religion, of loving, and of play r equire concrete actions which are never what they literally seem to be. Ritual offers a primary mode of pathologizing, of deliteralizing events and seeing them as we \"perform\" them."},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"As we go into a ritual, the soul of our actions \"comes out\"; or to ritualize a lite ral action, we \"put soul into it.\"...Ritual brings together action idea into an enactme nt. --James Hillman/ Re-Visioning Psychology For example, when you do a ritual (this could be \"High Magick\" or the way you pu t your toothpaste on your toothbrush each morning), it is a representation of someth ing internal which is being externalized. The symbol always starts on the inside and is projected outward. It is because of this observation that it is believed that the myt h was first, and the ritual was created as a projection of the myth. Rituals dramatically represent the need in man to transcend the barri ers of narrow ego- consciousness in order to experience himself as part of something greater . Since ritual is seen as the enactment of myth, the myth inherently possesses an archet ypal structure rather than being based on a logical format. Therefore: if one constructs a ritu al and attempts to do it with logic, this should be, by definition, in error. This c an be the first key to designing a ritual. It should not be strictly logic-oriented, but more archetypal in design. However, it is necessary to follow some practical guidelines. Magickal rit uals contain basic elements which must appear in approximately the following sequence: 1) setting up the circle to define a working area 2) a form of \"banishing\" to clear the working arena and help concentration and focusing. 3) Middle Pillar Exercise to bring in Light and build up libido or magick al potency. 4) invocation, or \"calling in\" of the desired godform or attribute, in an attemp t at self-transformation 5) charging of a eucharist with the energy of the godform, and its consumption as an epiphany with the god 6) meditative period 7) banishing to return the aspirant to \"normal\" consciousness 8) closing the Temple. These steps may be expanded to include divination, dance, dramatic scenar ios, etc. Any appropriate gestures may be added, but none of these basics can be omitte d without incurring peril, by exposing the soul to random forces. Rituals reveal values at their deepest levels. Men express in ritual w hat moves them the most. If the form of expression is conventional or obligatory, group values are reveal ed through the physical enactment of a myth. Ritual is the key to understandin g society, according to many anthropologists, including Levi Strauss. It is a key to getting a be tter understanding of a given society, and how it may function from within."},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"Ritual can be a rightness of routine which manifests in habitual patter ns; it may manifest in the precision of drill. Others see it as a prescribed series of man ipulations of proper combinations to achieve a specific purpose. A third, primitive category deals with ritual's basic objectives such as warding off evil, bringing good luck, or propitiation of supernatural forces. Students of religion have made use of these three different aspects of ritual in that they look upon them as the origin of religion. It is a technique of Magick to use these ethics as the control system of a given religion. The choice of th ese perspectives is arbitrary. Jung expands on the concept that ritual acts stand in direct contrast to te chnical acts. The former are purely symbolic, while the later are purposeful. This means that when one is doing something specific, one is purposeful in the action. A ceremony is magical so long as it does not result in effective work but preser ves the state of expectancy. In that case the energy is canalized into a new object and produ ces a new dynamism, which in turn remains magical only so long as it does not create effective work. --C.G. Jung/\"On the Nature of the Psyche\" Ceremonies and rituals are the means for periodically drawing up the su ms of energy, or libido, attached to symbols. Only periodic or regular repetition provokes expec tation. Therefore, since archetypal processes are recurrent or chronic, regu lar repetition of rituals builds expectations. Symbols are the abstract forms of religious ideas. They are expressed as rit es or ceremonies in the form of action. Only through a symbol, can a portion of energy which customaril y goes toward sustaining the regular course of life be transformed and channe led into another form. This produces cultural, rather than instinctive, activity. I ts by-product is the creation of surplus energy, which is then at the free disposal of the ego w hich can use this energy for further transformation. When one makes ritual use of symbols, they ar e prevented from falling back into a purely subconscious form of manifestat ion, (for instance disease, or neurosis). The purpose of ritual lies in its expression as an artform. Partaking in i ts performance is an end in itself. Ritual, as symbolic action, is the enactment of mythic patte rns for the sheer joy of relationship with the archetypal dimension. Ritual does not mean only the performance of sacred actions on particular occas ions, but is a state of mind which makes sacred all we do. Seeing through to the mythical patterns underlying common activities sanctifies all human acts. This includes t he pathological aspects of the archetypes even though this does not justify moral lapses to s ociety. Ritual is the expression of tension in a symbolized manner; we abreact our anxieties in ritual. It is therefore the transferal of stifled feelings. Rites are calculated to arouse the sentiments that support a given Pathworking. The value of ritual is: a). It is a method of organizing an experience. This allows more conscious contr ol of our growth and development."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"b). It lends grace and style to action. This prevents clumsy uncertainty, wast ed energy and distractions. c). It helps the general atmosphere by specific symbolism necessary to conjure a frame of mind conducive to the experience desired. The Gods must be invoked in a balanced manner: this is the value of a Magickal Order. How does an unskilled aspirant know what God to invoke and when it is ne cessary? Unless he is lucky enough to have prior training in psychology, he cannot even fathom what a Godform represents until his training is near completion. He could e ven do psychological harm to himself, inadvertently, by not letting \"sleeping dogs lay.\" The exce ption to this is the practice of Middle Pillar Exercise. This ritual is inherently b alanced and can do no harm to the psyche, practiced in excess, or poorly executed. Magick is the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity wi th Will. Whenever an individual performs a mind-altering experiment, he is per forming an act of Magick. Rituals are used to \"program\" a religious awakening. They are also used to overcome our random pre-programmed cultural narrowness concerning th e value of an inner psychic life. The Art of Magick is to blend the Magick and Science i nto ritual. This then allows an individual to \"control\" the experience, thus allowing him /her a form of self- realization, through relationship with the archetypal dimension. The ne arest definition science has for the Soul is long-term memory...the data experience. It has been argued that ritual occult beliefs and practices tend to mani fest during crisis situations. These situations occur where formed principles of social organization are in conflict. These produce actual or potential disputes which cannot be s ettled by judicial or other purely intellectual procedures. Ritual operates where there are fundamental disharmonies within the theoretical harmony of a social situation. One e vokes basic stresses in order for the ritual to work most effectively, or in \"right action\". The term \"right action\" is used in Magick in reference to the Will. In t he Bhagavad Gita , Krishna says: The world is imprisoned in its own activity except when actions are perf ormed as worship of God. Therefore, you must perform every action sacramentally and be free from all attachment to the results. Remember, the purpose of ritual is an end in itself. This leaves no ration ale behind lusting for results. There are pitfalls inherent in the practice of ritual. Jung spoke of boom erang effects. There can be many unforeseen and unforeseeable repercussions in a self-dir ected program. This is the value of guidance along the path by a qualified teacher. The teacher has b een there, and knows the dangers of each step. Archetypes do not only manifest in benevol ent ways. They are good/bad, and their activation in the psyche unleashes their dynamism . Every initiation has its ordeals:"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"But she said: the Ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known and hal f concealed: the Law is for all. --A. Crowley/ Liber Al vel Legis I:34 The ordeals are unknown to the aspirant, and repercussions cannot be anti cipated. These Ordeals are independent of the aspirant's or teacher's conscious care; they come from the Self. They are not, like traditional ordeals, formal, or identical for all candidat es. The complexes afford a real test of the ethics and conduct, and compel the asp irant to discover his own nature. He has the opportunity to become more aware of himself by bri nging his secret motivating forces to the surface. If any ritual is completely or openly given there would be dogma and that is not the purpose of Magick. When a ritual is begun, there is a synergetic effect that of ten occurs in the inevitable ordeal. The secret part of the ritual is, in fact, this uni que ordeal. The secret part of the ritual is, in fact, this unique ordeal. That is the concealed as pect of the action. The ordeal is the evoked form or stress and the \"right action\" is the movemen t toward knowing one's True Will. Another pitfall of ritual is the tendency for the ego to identify with th e godforms outside of the magickal circle. In Ego and Archetype, Edward F. Edinger recounts an anc ient remedy for this inflation. There is an interesting ancient Mithraic ritual called \"The Rite of the Crown\" designed to protect against inflation. The following procedure was enacted during the initiation of a Roman soldier into Mithraism. At sword's point a crown was offered the can didate; but the initiate was taught to push it aside with his hand and affirm \"Mithra i s my crown.\" Thereafter he never wore a crown or garland, not even at banquets or at military triumphs, and whenever a crown was offered him he refused it saying, \"It belongs to my god. According to Robert Grinnell, in Alchemy in a Modern Woman, women bear a partic ular relationship to the unconscious and ritual; this bears on her deepes t significance. This distinction between feminine and masculine ways of experiencing t he unconscious can best be seen in the different ways prima materia is repre sented. Whereas in a man's psychology the unconscious as prima materia is experienc ed as chaos, as violent and irrational processes of generation and destruction, in a woman it appears as a fascinating psychic background for sacred images and rituals expressive of her fundamental feminine conscience. Later, he goes on expanding on this feminine experience. Here we have both the problem and the deeper meaning of the \"modern woman.\" For just as she produces an intensified polarity which seems very \"modern\" an d raises to consciousness factors which seem \"masculine\" and which are left out of the dominant masculine view, so too she activates the unconscious rites linked to forgotte n customs belonging to the primitive state of man whose aim was precisely to reconcile c onflicting opposites. These rites are performed by men and women, but their content eman ates"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"from the divine sphere which is past, present, and future. These rites u nite the instinctual pattern or pole of the constellated archetype to its divine, spir itual pole: the animal shadow of the archetype and its superhuman, divine aspect are linked togeth er. A \"reversal\" occurs, in which the shadow of a latent consciousness at a psyc hoid level is extracted and \"sublimated.\" The archetype in its archaic aspect is raised to a contemporary level. This ennobling process shows the value of recreating ancient rites for m odern living; it lies in the fact that they bring together the instinctual and divine poles of t he archetypal continuum. They provide a sense of unification unobtainable through other means. This is a healing balm for our modern dualistic, or fragmented, consciousness. Insert (square talisman) c. Practical QBL: The Holographic Concept of Realit y. The true purpose of philosophy was once held to be the search for essence s, the underlying nature of things manifested. \"Meaning\" is nowhere to be found except in t hose fields of study that point to a unity between man and the universe. In modern terms th is could be called a search for the archetypal level of reality. Since the dawn of time there have been two conflicting explanations for the nature and structure of the world in which we live. These two conflicting ideas ap pear in Greek thought: Democritus stressed the field theory and Heracles the part icle theory. Today, fields are stressed in relativity Physics, while particles are emph asized in quantum mechanics. Throughout history many attempts have been made to synthesize the field and the particle theories. In current Physics those attempts fall under the name Ge ometrodynamics (Wheeler, 1959). \"A Holographic Concept of Reality\" by Miller, et al.(1) shows how a cross synthesis of particle theory and field theory can shed new light on living p rocesses. As postulated by Northrup and Burr (1935), the pattern or organization of any biol ogical system is established by a complex electrodynamic field. This field is in part determined by its physio-chemical components, seen on an atomic or quantum mechani cal level of analysis. This field also, in part, determines the behavior and orientati on of those components. Presman (1970) has postulated that such electromagnetic (EM) fields norm ally serve as conveyors or information from the environment to the organisms, within the organi sm, and among different organisms. He further postulated that in the course of evol ution, organisms have come to use these fields in conjunction with the well- known sensory, nervous, and endocrine systems of the body. They affect coordination and integr ation. Szent-Gyorgi (1957, 1960) has theorized that cells and other biological component s might have various electronic solid-state physical properties such as the se mi-conductor. He suggests that the use of quantum electrodynamics is necessary in order to u nderstand biological processes which regulate the vital activities in organisms. Beck er (1963) has"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"maintained that it is already established that EM forces can be used to ch ange a number of fundamental life processes in mammals. Heisenberg explored the possible relevance of the quantum indetermi nacy of elementary particles for biological systems, especially in humans (Koestler, 1972). He st ated that there are two places in the human system where the quantum in-determinacy of a single particle can have a profound influence. The first is that of mutation in the genetic c ode. The second important influence is the alteration of the behavior of neurons during h uman thought processes. Tien (1969) has conceptualized the mind as mass in relative motion, and the br ain as energy at relative electrical charges in motion. They can be seen as electr ons bombarding a television screen, where personality is seen as a time series of scinti llation frames of consciousness. Personality becomes a reverberating input-output pat tern of self-creation, seeking information or patterns of energy from the environment, as well as f rom its own memories. According to the holographic model of reality, all the objects we can observe are three- dimensional images formed of standing and moving waves by EM and nuclear process es. All the objects of our world are 3-D images formed electro-magnetically, i.e., h olograms. This concept and the models of human information processing based on the hologram, throw interesting light on the philosophical traditions which hold that the world of objects is an illusion. POSTULATE (First): The \"reality hologram\" which appears as a stable world of material objects is the elementary particle which has a long-term existence and fairly simple r ules of interaction. POSTULATE (Second): The existence of a \"biohologram\" which appears as mobile and evolving, through th e DNA molecule. This \"biohologram\" projects a dynamic 3-D image that serves as a guiding matrix for the manipulation and organization of the \"reality hologram\". Thus, there are mobile self-organizing holograms moving through a relativel y static simpler hologram. The possibility exists that such \"bioholograms\" could achieve sufficient coherence to continue existence as a pattern of radiant energy apart from a mate rial substate. Holography is the process of recording and recreating complex 3-D wave fronts in space. The holography with which we are most familiar deals mostly with the visi ble spectrum, so we tend to think of holography in terms of 3-D photography. However, holography can be conceived in different realms of the spectrum. Th e whole process of lasers and laser abilities to create images in space in visible l ight radiation is closely connected to microwave research and a device called a \"maser,\" whi ch broadcasts coherent radiation in the microwave frequencies. It should be possib le in theory, with the"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"proper kind of equipment, to capture and broadcast complex 3-D wave-form st ructures in space across a whole broad band of the EM spectrum, \"broad-band holography.\" Some of the interesting properties of holography have to do with its differen ces from photography. In photography, the light from an object is reflected onto a flat sur face where it essentially discolors that surface; or rather, the shadow that it casts discolors that surface. If you cut a photograph in half, you have half of the original picture that came from the original. Holography is quite different. In a hologram, the pattern of light that is created by the object is recorded at e ach point on the film. Each grain contains the whole image. Each image is slightly differe nt, however, and all of the images are very vague and fuzzy. Detail in a photograph is not particularly connected to the size in the sens e that a small piece of a photograph will have a lot of detail on a small area of the scene. A large photograph will have a lot of detail on all of the scene. In a hologram, each grain has som e of the information about the whole scene. A large hologram has a lot of details about t he whole scene. So something different happens when you cut a hologram in half; you are left with the original picture, but it loses detail. In the nuclei of each cell in the human body, the DNA carries the stru cture of our whole body. Not just our physical form, but also the processes that form undergoes in terms of survival. If all of these things are in truth locked in the DNA, how does that turn into a functioning being? The DNA could possibly be the holographic projectors. The DNA could be pr ojecting a field that would be experiencing by other DNA in the body. The DNA, in a se nse, could be linked together. The DNA are also linked to their own cells that they are co ntrolling via mechanisms of RNA transfer and enzymatic action in the cell. POSTULATE (Third): The DNA is the projector of the \"biohologram,\" both at the cellular level an d at the whole- organismic level. The DNA creates a situation of a complex pattern of 3-D EM st anding and moving wave fronts in the space that the organism occupies. These wave front s interact with, interpenetrate with, and interdetermine the physical subst ance that makes up the creature. The biohologram has characteristic properties of affecting the DNA that occ upy specific positions within the biohologram. The nervous system constitutes a coo rdination mechanism that integrates DNA projections of the rest of the cell s in the system. It is a coordination mechanism, first and foremost. It aligns these cellular hologra ms and the linkage of the whole creature hologram. The DNA in a particular cell is not totally active. It has been determined that there may be as little as 1% of the DNA present in the nucleus of the cell acting as the determinant for the structure of that cell. The nervous system, interesting enough, has th e highest percentage of operating DNA of any cell system in the body, up to at least 10% of the D NA in the brain cells. The neuron nuclei are the most active."},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"The nervous system projects a biohologram which interacts with the cel lular bioholograms. If the membrane structure of the neuron nuclei are examined closely, i t will be seen that the different cavity systems that enter the outer membrane and also ente r the inner membranes, will be seen to topologically be a single membrane. So the nucleus is lacking a membrane, or the neurons are lacking a membrane in the sense that two of the ir membranes are topologically one membrane. Within the holographic model, the neurons are not actually seen as brain cell s. The brain is the cell, and the neurons are like a distributed nucleus for that cell . As long as the biohologram is functioning properly, as long as the nervous system is continuing to coordinate and project the complex 3-D fields that suppor t the biological processes in the organism, the organism survives. When the biohologram ceases to function properly, the organism suffers. And when the principle action of the bi ohologram stops, the organism dies. If there is any scientific correlate to the concept of Soul, it is most p robably this bioholographic pattern system. The actual geometrical structuring of the D NA is a holographic \"lens\", projecting \"reality\" and the material world as a hologram- image when it interacts with the ultimate stuff of the universe, electromagne tic field energy. People can be seen as wavefronts, not solid matter. Using this modeling or view of the universe, it is possible to comprehend b oth the cosmos and consciousness as a single unbroken totality of movement. When one works with such an implicate (or implied) order, one begins with the undivided whol eness of the universe. The task of science is to derive the various sub-totalities, which could be called as explicate, and show how these relatively autonomous sub-totalities are part of a greater w hole. Explicate or observed phenomena then become part of the implicate or imp lied whole. To begin to understand this form of ordering, a new tool for perception is need ed. This new concept of order involves the discrimination of the relative differenc es in both time and space. Attention is now given to distinguishing between similar diff erences in both time and space. Attention is now given to distinguishing between similar diff erences and different similarities. Such a format in mathematics is called a ratio, or matrix fi eld. \"The universe is a cosmic computer on the pregeometric level of information in which spac e and time appear as secondary statistical constructs.\"(2) The Vector Equilibrium Matrix (3) (see Book VII: TIPHARETH) is su ch a matrix; although seen as a geometry at any stage, it is pregeometric in that it descri bes the change from one state to the next. It is a quantized state of information. So are the \"H olographic Concept of Reality\" and the Qabalah (QBL) Tree of Life model. These \"ratios\" or \"similarities\" between successive steps remain s invariant. As the degree of steps becomes infinitely high, it then become possible to describe random events. These events are not determined by any finite number of steps, but rather they h ave a certain kind of order, one which is of an indefinable high degree."},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"We no longer use the term \"disorder\" (or chaos), but rather distinguish b etween different degrees of order. Order is not to be identified with predictability; it is found in the connectivity of two events. The mechanism used to identify an \"event\" is m ost revealing: Insight is the perception (or psychological equivalent) of a certain type of r esonance. This specific form of ordering (insight) has meaningful implications to the individual experiencing it. Intelligence is a sequence of such insights, leading t o purpose and practical behavior. This resonance allows for the transference of information from an implicat e order to the explicate order, from latent to manifest. Since the total of the explicat e is encoded throughout the implicate order, the resonance provides a direct access or return to psyche. This resonance is called a \"complex\" in psychology. The electromagnetic field, which is the ground of the holographic image , obeys the laws of the quantum theory, and when these are properly applied to the field it i s found that this, also, is actually a multi-dimensional reality which can only under certain c onditions be simplified as a 3-D reality. The implicate order has to be extended into a multi-dimensional realit y. In principle, this reality is one unbroken whole, including the entire universe with all its \"fields\" and \"particles\". This holographic concept enfolds and unfolds in a multi- dimensional order, the dimensionality of which is effectively infinite. It is \"matter\" on it 's most fundamental level of understanding. What we call empty space contains an immense background of energy. \"Matter\" ( as we know it now) is a small, \"quantized\" wavelike excitation on top of this back ground, like a tiny ripple on a vast sea. Space, which has so much energy, is full rather than e mpty. Thus, in Greek thought, the School of Parmenides and Zeno held that space was a plen um. Matter, thought of as consisting of special recurrent stable and separabl e forms in this ether (4), would be transmitted through the plenum as if the latter we re empty. The holographic concept of reality suggests that the implicate order applie s both to matter (living and non-living) and to consciousness, and that it can therefore make possible an understanding of the general relationship of these two. With this broader -based perspective of Malkuth we may be able to come to some notion of the common ground betw een psyche and matter. Matter as a whole can be understood in terms of the notion that the implicat e order is the immediate and primary actuality, while the explicate order can be deri ved as a particular, distinguished case of the implicate order. Pribram (1971) has given eviden ce backing up his suggestion that memory is recorded over all the brain. Information concernin g a given object or quality is not stored in a particular cell or localized in a part of the brain. Instead, all the information is enfolded over the whole. This storage resembles a h ologram in its function, but its actual structure is much more complex. This model of the electron as an enfolded order is grasped in thought, as the presence together of many different but interrelated degrees of transformations of ensembles. For"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"example, music is sensed immediately as the presence together of m any different but interrelated degrees of transformations of tone and sounds. In listening to music, one is therefore directly perceiving an implicat e order. It is clear that visual images must undergo active transformation as they \"enfold\" into the b rain and nervous system. There is a basic similarity between the order of our immediate experie nce of movement and the implicate order as expressed in terms of our thoughts. Movement is co mprehended in terms of a series of inter-penetrating and intermingling elements i n different degrees of enfoldment, all present together. In terms of the implicate order of the holographic concept of reality, moveme nt is a relationship of certain phases of what is to other phases of what is, that ar e in different stages of enfoldment. Therefore \"imply\" involves the notion of enfoldment . Here is meant not just the content of thought, rather it is also the actual structure, fun ction, and activity of thought that is part of the implicate order. The manifest (that which is recurrent, stable, and separable) conten t of consciousness is based essentially on memory. This allows such content to be held in a fairl y constant form. To make possible such consistency it is also necessary that this content be organized. Not only through relatively fixed associations, the organization occurs with the aid of the rules of logic, and our basic categories of space, time, causality, universality. In thi s way an overall system of concepts and mental images develop, more or less faithful representations of the \"manifested\" world. This all-systems view includes The Tree of Life, it's correspondenc e system, archetypes and the holographic concept of reality. Matter and consciousness can both be understood within this implicat e ordering. A moment cannot be precisely related to measurements of space and time, b ut rather converses a vaguely defined region which is extended in space and has a durat ion in time. The laws of the implicate order are such that there is a relatively inde pendent, recurrent, stable sub-totality which constitutes the explicate order. This conne ction of the mind and body has commonly been called psychosomatic, from the Greek \"psyche\", meani ng \"mind\" and \"soma\" (for \"body\"). In the implicate order we have to say that mi nd enfolds matter in general, and therefore the body in particular. Similarly, the b ody enfolds matter in general, and therefore the body in particular. Similarly, the body enfolds n ot only the mind but also in some sense the entire material universe. The more comprehensive, deeper, and more-inward actuality is neither mind nor body, but rather a yet higher-dimensioned actuality. It is their common ground an d yet is of a nature beyond both. We do not say that mind and body causally affect each other, but rather th at the movements of both are the outcome of related projections of a common hi gher- dimension."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"Thus, since the quantum theory implies that elements that are separ ated in space are generally non-causally and non-locally related projections of a higher-dime nsional reality, it follows that movements separated in time are also such projections of th is reality. Inquiry into the psychological origins of mathematical models is still to a l arge extent neglected, even though inquiry into precisely this area would be espec ially significant. Inquiry into the preconscious creative processes in researcher's s ubconsciousness is also still largely ignored. The concept of the collective unconscious defines that \"intermediate realm of subtle bodies\" without presuming to say anything definitive abou t the substance. Von Franz (1979) has shown that most all scientific advances and the modeling u sed to describe those advances are all explicate ordering of a more implicate view i nvolving specific archetypes. If we look back to the scientific-mythological world principles that Greek natural philosophy understood as the ground of being, one is struck b y the fact that most of them represent the intuitive-visual pre-stage of what has de veloped into today's scientific hypotheses or thought-models. Alchemy, in the strictest sense of the word, has two parents: Greek rat ional philosophy and Egyptian technologies. The Greek philosophers initiated rational thought regarding the problems of nature, of matter, space and time, but made practically no experi ments to verify these models. Their theories were bolstered by certain observa tions but it never occurred to them actually to experiment. Egyptians, on the other hand, had highly developed chemical-magical techni ques, but in general gave no thought to them, either philosophical or theoretical. When the two trends of Greek and Egyptian civilizations came together they united in a very fruit ful marriage, of which alchemy was their child. From the Greek philosophy all the basi c concepts are still valid in modern physics. When considering the concepts of matter and space, the problem of time, one t hinks of Zeno. The concept of energy was Heraclitus. The concept of the particle was c reated by Leukippos and Democritus. The concept of affinity of the elements and th e idea of the four worlds prevailed right up to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuri es. All of these concepts were created by the different pre-Socratic philosophers. In Greece it was a switch from a religious mythological outlook on the existen ce of the world to a philosophical one. It was a foundation for the implicate order of mod ern sciences. One of the ideas, namely that the basic elements of the univer se are mathematical forms, was created through the Pythagoreans and was developed into a slight ly varied form of Plato. It is now again present in the Heisenberg's theory and quantum mec hanics. There is a strong line going through Greek philosophy into modern sciences, e ven though it never occurred to the Greeks to make practical tests. In Egypt, techn iques had been highly developed but these chemical techniques were used mostly in a spec ific realm of Egyptian religious life. The great opposites of human nature, extroversion and introversion, play a treme ndous role in the historical development of alchemy and modern science. The th eoreticians of natural philosophy among the Greeks had been more extroverted and the Egyp tian"},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"technologies had been more interested in its psychological inner aspe cts. So they switched roles at that moment, but naturally the inner opposition and the play of th ese two opposite attitudes continue. Geometry is a divine art, because the law of the creation of the world is reveal ed in its axiomatic structure. Space and time are regarded as a 4-D metric field that determines the distance between closely adjacent points. The metric components attr ibuted to the field have absolute meaning. One cannot speak of them without taking into account the p resence of matter. In Einstein's theory the same primordial image turns up in modified form, but it is also closely joined to the idea of matter. According to Einstein, matter would be an excited state of a \"dynamic geometry\". The superspace of this dynamic geometry contains \"wor mholes\" in which the electric lines of force are, so to speak, caught in the topology of s uperspace. It was Newton and Kepler who began the process of partial secularization and mathematicization of the image, with the loss of its \"mythical\" meaning. T he aspects of the symbol gradually receded into the background. Today, however, there is within the holographic concept of reality, an implicat e aspect to specific explicate modeling. The archetypal images formed the basis of all scientific ideas about time and about space as 3-D conceived, as well as the idea of the atom (omni present point) and the idea of continuum and discontinuum. Therefore all these fundamental scientific hypotheses are, in the end, derived from a mandala-formed God -image. Whenever physicists attempt to construct a comprehensive model of real ity or a thought- model of what they are doing, they always return to a quaternity of principles, gen erally without suspecting that Jungian psychology long ago discovered the quaternal st ructure of consciousness. The purpose of science is to bring inner images into coinc idence with external facts. Both the soul of the perceiver and that which is recognize d by perception are subject to an order thought to be objective. The combination of the holographic concept of reality, Jungian archetypes, and Th e Tree of Life (QBL) represent an implicate ordering which then allows for explicate application and relationship. Their combination enfolds all other aspects now envi sioned and thus forms the basic foundation of Malkuth, the world of physical images. * * * Famous Vegetarians: Homer, George Bernard Shaw, Count Tolstoy,Mahatma Gandhi, Buddha, Confucius, Moses, Cicero, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Plato, Nietzsc he, Laotze, Albert Einstein, Henry David Thoreau, St. Grancis of Assisi, Francois Voltaire, Arthur Schopenhauer, Plutarch, Lucius Seneca, Socrates, Zoroas ter, Leonardo da Vinci, Aristotle, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Charles Darwin, Sir Is aac Newton, Milton. 2. PSYCHOLOGY a. Psychological Model: The Path of Individuation"},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"The path of Individuation is the psychological equivalent of initiation . The goal of individuation is self-realization through increasing conscious relati onship with the Self, archetype of wholeness. This Self includes both positive and negative t raits of an individual which, in the beginning of analysis, are generally projected out, or attribut ed to, the environment. As the ego continues its heroic journey through the labyri nthine psyche, it comes into confrontation with personifications of various archetypal char acters. During the maturing process, these characters emerge from the undifferenti ated mass of unconscious contents. Though their presence in the psyche was implied from the b eginning, they begin to unfold in unique patterns in the life of the individual. One meets such intriguing archetypal figures (complexes) as the shadow, p ersona, hero, anima/animus, puer, wise old man, trickster, great mother, healer, divine c hild, self, etc. When these figures, and their behavior patterns, remain unconscious, the y are projected onto other people, as \"my enemy,\" \"my great love,\" \"my wise teacher,\" etc. In tim e the analysand learns to distinguish these recurrent patterns from the personalities of the people with whom he is involved. Another way these patterns lay claim to an in dividual and exert their influence is through the identification of the ego with the archetype. Then we have cases of \"I am the great lover,\" \"I am the great teacher of wisdom,\" or \"I a m especially gifted and prodigious.\" Using Tree of Life pathworking techniques as a mode of creative imagination , personified forms are encountered as gods or goddesses, and the aspirant comes to a conscious relationship with them, both internal and external. He learns to recogni ze them when he sees them. Most importantly, he has a framework for experiencing these int ernal personalities as distinct from his individuality; they are, after all, coll ective patterns which can manifest in anyone under the proper circumstances. This attempt l eads to self- realization through the transcendent function, which is a symbol of the union of opposites. In Magick, it is known as the Holy Guardian Angel. We are not alone. We are not totally encased in our ego-selves. There is a companio n, a comrade, a guardian angel, a greater self who is always with us. When looked at in this way, it is seen at once that individuation is more than behavior modifyi ng oneself out of bad habits. Individuation is a religious endeavor. (5) This is no way to finally dispose of undesirable qualities or weaknes ses. Rather it is a method of coming to conscious knowledge of the gamut of motivations and possib le behavior of which one is capable. It is a process of rebalancing psychic func tioning, integrating the fragments of archetypal patterns which underlie hum an existence. It is not the road for all. Frequently those who choose to pursue it are impel led by depression, illness, breakdown of current adaptation to reality, or stagn ation. The unconscious manifestations demand attention in a form the ego cannot ignore i ndefinitely. One does not choose the path of individuation, but rather is chosen by it. I f the ego can withstand the temptations, ordeals, and peril at the hands of the unkno wn, it is eventually rewarded with an expanded experience of self and a rejuvenation, or rebir th. In his essay on the \"Relationship between the Ego and the Unconscious,\" Ju ng has stated that"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"It is impossible to achieve individuation by conscious intention, because con scious intention invariably leads to a typical attitude that excludes whatever does not fit in with it. This assimilation of the unconscious contents leads, on the contra ry to a condition in which the conscious intention is excluded and supplanted by a proc ess of development that seems irrational. This process alone signifies individu ation, and its product is individuality as we have defined it; particular and universal at once....Only when the unconscious is assimilated does the individuality emerge more clearly, together with the psychological phenomenon which links the ego with the non -ego and is designated by the word attitude. But this time it is no longer a typical attitude but an individual one. What the conscious ego can do in regard to individuation is make the commitment to attempt to work in harmony with the unfolding subconscious process, to give it his constant attention, and to place proper value on the experience.

The symbolic content enters the soul through the locus of misfortune or the wound of the body, and then it becomes the task of the soul to make friends with this stran ger in its midst.

It opened a slit to another wor ld and we saw into that which lies beyond. The trauma weakens the boundaries bet ween man and the archetypal world. As a result, when the healing finally takes place, he is not merely restored to his former self. He is recreated and is now a larger person th an he was before. (7) Inner life begins to open up: when one looks inside, there is no longer the opaque blackness, but a rich field of experience filled with entities w ho long for attention or worship. This does much to alleviate feelings of isolation and despair, provi ding that one has proper guidance in this realm. This guiding force also emerges from the unconscious: The unconscious, through dreams and through its manifestations in everyday li fe, provides all the information we need to know. The unconscious, with its ingenious way of symbolizing, sets the picture before us: this is how it is, there are th ese and these obstacles, but there is a chance of breaking through to a new position with a wider per spective. Or the unconscious may place violent objections in the path, warning of disast er if the stirring up of archetypal material is encouraged to continue.(8) Individuation requires the balancing, objective viewpoint of another wh o not only cares for your soul, but is intimately familiar with the recurrent themes of arch etypal processes. This helps the ego to avoid becoming possessed by any given pattern. Both commitment and will are required in the process, for once begun, it must be followed through to i ts goal, lest one be lost forever in the abyss of the transcendent imagination. New discoverie s must not only be made, but assimilated. As in Magic, there must be concurrent experie nce, and psychological insight concerning the meaning of the experience. The indivi dual meaningfulness of an experience is what creates the unique personali ty of those with an awareness of the self. The instinctive feeling of significance is exp anded upon by rooting experiences in their mythical patterns. The ego must never presume to wield power over the unconscious lest i t provoke a reactionary attack for this spiritual pride. This inflation disturbs the progress of the work by returning the ego to the unconscious state of identifying itself wit h the powers and potency of the unconscious. This control fantasy is the basis of many neuroses . Some might call it \"black magic.\" In his essay on the \"Relationship between the Ego and the Unconscious\", Ju ng has stated that: It is impossible to achieve individuation by conscious intention, because con scious intention invariably leads to a typical attitude that excludes whatever does not fit in with it. The assimilation of the unconscious contents leads, on the contr ary to a condition in which the conscious intention is excluded and supplanted by a proc ess of development that seems irrational. This process alone signifies individu ation, and its product is individuality as we have defined it; particular and universal at once...Only when the unconscious is assimilated does the individuality emerge more clearly, together with the psychological phenomenon which links the ego with the non -ego and is designated by the word attitude. But this time it is no longer a typical attitude but an individual one."},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"What the conscious ego can do in regard to individuation is make the commitment to attempt to work in harmony with the unfolding subconscious process, to give it his constant attention, and to place proper value on the experience.

PERSONA: The persona is the outer personality presented to other s by an individual. It could be pictured as a mask of conformity, which is a conscious adaptive me chanism. Choices in adaptation are made by the ego, which builds up the persona, or \"fr ont.\" It is a response to the demands of society for \"normal\" behavior. Most people have at least some desire to appear appropriate in their social milieu. Our obsessions for conformity are reflected in fashion, religion, education, and entertainment. We seek co mmon experiences. We have a desire to \"fit in,\" like a cog in a machine. Persona shows in special cost umes or lifestyles; alternatively, our job may determine the type of appearance and behavior \"expected\" of an individual by society. For instance, who would expect a brain s urgeon to be a sloppy, unorganized personality? This would hardly inspire confidence in his patients. So, the persona is the public image, which implies certain constraints an d limitations. The persona lies very close to ego-consciousness, and it is therefore fairly e asy to determine symbols of this persona in your personal life."},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"The symbols for the persona are cover-ups: they may appear in dreams as dress, h ats, armor, veils, shields; or they may take on the characteristics of a profession or trade, as tools, equipment of various sorts, certain specific books; or they may be refl ected in an automobile, or even in some instances a house or apartment. Or the persona may be expressed in awards, diplomas, or a variety of so-called \"status symbols.\" Persona problems are common in all parts of society, for as people identify themsel ves as belonging to a certain category they begin to adopt behavior appropriate to that category and to discard what does not fit. Thus the \"identity crisis\" about which Er ik Erikson has written so much, tends to find a partial solution, at least, in the assumption of a pers ona. It may not be the best solution but it often works, until something happens to b reak down the persona. While the persona is functioning well, many people identify with it. ( 9) It is easily seen that no one can be merely a doctor, a teacher, or an artist. There are many other facets to psychic life which may be explored once the distinction b etween ego and persona has been made clear in the mind of the aspirant. (2). THE SHADOW: Shadows are created on paintings by mixing a color with its op posite. Every painter knows that you cannot even create the illusion of depth wit hout including shadows in the painting. The ego appears as a flat caricature without the sh adow-aspects to round-out the form. The shadow includes those qualities of the individ ual which have been rejected, repressed, or unlived. In short, it represents the infer ior side of life, which even though it is autonomous, may be judged as negative from the ego's point of view. As a ru le of thumb, the stronger the persona, the more repressed the shadow side . This can especially be true in religious persons who identify only wi th the good qualities of brightness and light. But in Physics, the brighter the light, the deepe r the shadows which are cast. Jung even explored the premise that there is a shadowy aspect to the su bconscious of God in ANSWER TO JOB . When the shadow and instinctual life are not differentiated, they form a contaminated state which urges the holder of this fantasy to exp erience \"devilish\" forms. This shapeshifter is considered the strongly polar ized opposite of \"absolute good\", which is \"the adversary.\" A conscious realization of the shadow produces an inner reconciliation which might open the door to manifestation of some of the unlived potential. \"The sacrifice of innocent purity also implies the realizati on of the shadow which releases one from identification with the role of innocent victim an d the tendency to project the evil executor on to God or neighbor.\" (10) Let us take the shadow as an example. It is the image of all sides of personalit y that I could become. In my dreams he may be a brother, a schoolfriend I feared or even envied, an outcast or a success, or a professional colleague whose traits are those I most di slike--but which are closest to mine. Because of my identification with a personali ty I call \"my ego\", the shadow usually appears as inferior and as rejected by society. The devel opment of one partial personality, the ego, builds a shadow at the same time. Ego development in our culture proceeds through choices between good and bad, right and wrong, li ke and dislike. The bad, the wrong, and disliked fall into shadow, becoming fearful. Soon the s uppressed side becomes the repressed side; the shadow archetype which is a pote ntial of destructive values, an \"instinct to evil\" or \"destrudo\", is activated by the cast-off im pulses of daily life. The more right I become, the more the shadow is fed with contrary moti ves until the extremes of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can result. Because the shadow is an archetyp al"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"figure, and not merely a cover-name for the repressed, it is a living person ality with intentions, feelings, and ideas. By keeping innocent and self-righteous in ego-consciousness, I force the sh adow into the dark where he archetypally belongs anyway as the devil is depicted in hell and t he criminal fantasied in the night. So, in dreams, he will show in ghettos, as a welfare case, an invalid, crippled or diseased. He appears also in the images of power politician, fake guru, street gang, or person of darker skin...The shadow also determines the ulterior motives in plans, the schemes for professional advancement, the nasty gossip, the sellouts, all beyond and in spite of our honest intentions. Al though I have described him mainly in terms of ethics, the shadow can as well carry any incompatible aspect--one's unlived sexuality or primitivity and one's u nlived potential achievements and cultural sensitivity. Especially, the shadow present s images of one's pathology: sadism, hypochrondriachal complaining, or any of the various psychic syndromes that reflect in caricature one's overall personality structu re . (11) (3). THE DOUBLE: As the shadow is generally a negative projection of psychic c ontents onto a member of the same sex, the double manifests as a projection of positive traits to members of the same sex. It is an image of the magical self, operating on the pri nciple of \"likeness.\" Projections of the double may fall upon our \"best friend\" , role models, mentors, etc. There are implications within this archetype which li nk it to homoerotic love, whether this tendency is lived out sexually, or not. The double carries b oth spiritual and erotic significance. Its activation means we are coming to an awareness of our own androgynous tendenc ies, a form of wholeness. The double is conceived of as beautiful, with a youthful quality of near- perfection. Its aspects include aid, or support, and comfort, a fusion of the f ate of the partners, a rapport and camaraderie. The partners share their feelings, ne eds, dreams, desires, and potential futures in a spirit of profound equality. The do uble can function as a soul-guide to inner depth and value. When there is an age discrepancy betwee n the partners, the older generally stimulates the process of psychic matu rity in the younger; the younger brings a sense of renewal to the older. Darker aspects of the double include a tendency to remain in sort of perpe tual adolescence, or a tendency toward homosexual expression may be repressed cutting off a vital avenue to the unconscious. The \"other\" may instead be conceived of as competiti on, or someone committed against your success. ... the double is a soul-mate of intense warmth and closeness. Love between me n and love between women, as a psychic experience, is often rooted in projection of the double, just as anima/us is projected in love between the different sexes. A nd as with anima/us, such love may occur within or without the heroic quest. Fur thermore, since the double is a soul figure, the sexual instinct may or may not become involve d. That is, the double motif may include a tendency to homosexuality, but is not nece ssarily a homosexual archetype. Rather, the double embodies the spirit of love between th ose of the same sex. And the spirit of love in the double is what I see as the support ive ground of the ego . (12)"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"This spirit of love between those of the same sex is often misunderstood : A psychology that wants to improve its reading of the archetypes can hardly accept a psychotherapy which is biased toward man-to-man relationships, tending to see t hem only in terms of illness to be cured or controlled.

What appears in the personal picture as 'messes '...are more likely expressions of the conflictive side of an archetype, or frict ions brought about by the mixing of archetypes. Seen in this way, psychotherapy, by taking into account the archetype, could propitiate psychic movement following along wi th the dominant archetype in which erotica among men appears, and it would accept this dominant as the very vehicle for psychotherapeutic movement... (13) Otto Rank attributed a high spiritual significance to this archetype, and c onsidered it a fundamental of personality. ..a positive evaluation of the Double as the immortal soul leads to the buildup of the prototype of personality from the self; whereas the negative interpretation of the Double as a symbol of death is symptomatic of the disintegration of the modern personality type...Yet the double in its most primitive form, the shadow, repr esents both the living and the dead person. In animate man there dwells as a strange guest a more feeble Double--his ot her Self in the form of his Psyche--whose kingdom is the world of dreams. When the cons cious Self sleeps, the Double works and watches. Such an image, reflecting the visibl e Self and constituting a second Self, is, with the Romans, the Genius; with th e Persians, the Fravauli; with the Egyptians, the Ka...Originally conceived of as a guardian angel, assuring immortal survival to the self, the double eventually appears as precis ely the opposite, a reminder of the individual's immortality, indeed, the announcer of deat h itself. (14) This is a curious admixture, where the double represents on the one han d a mutual fantasy between members of the same sex, and on the other the immortal self. It touches on deep areas of social taboo in either event. The androgynous being, whether literal or metaphorical has been traditionally tabooed and venerated, or feared and worshi pped at the same time. Mythologically, the hero is a fusion of two separate selves, the mortal and i mmortal aspects, in a single personality. He has reabsorbed his double, or twin. Thi s yields a self- creative power wherein he works for his immortality by creating lasti ng achievements. The unconscious union of \"like\" with \"like\" in the form of hom osexual relationships may appear in dreams as a symbol of a stage in the primitive idea of self-fertilizat ion. In this manner, the double unlocks creative processes. INSERT PICTURE GREEK GODS ON THE TREE OF LIFE"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"c. Mythic Correspondences: In this book, the Gods and Goddesses of Greek mythology are depicted as arraye d on both spheres and paths of the Tree of Life, but only the paths of the Middle Pillar are explained with mythic correspondences. For a complete attribution of Greek G ods to the Paths of the Tree of Life, see Pantheon: Archetypal Encounters in Daily Living , Philo Stone (1982). There each godform is described in much greater detail, including characteri stic personalities. There are many options for attributions to Malkuth. Each is included for a p articular reason, although it might also be corresponded elsewhere on the Tree. 1. Hestia: Goddess of the Hearth. The first and last tribute at any rite was al ways offered to Hestia, so she leads off the list of correspondences. She is analogous to Malku th through her functions as \"locality\" and the \"focal point.\" Without internal focu s or concentration, we can perceive no other psychic images. 2. The Kore: Archetypal Maiden. The Korae include the youthful forms of Her a, Artemis, Athena, Psyche, and especially Persephone. They represent the budlik e quality of the naive, virginal psyche before its encounter and transformation in the underworl d of the unconscious. The Neophyte's psychological condition mirrors that of this ar chetypal bride, Malka. The puella, or daughter, is doomed to die, and this is experienced as an inn er act of surrender. Rape is the image here of initiation into the psychic realm. Rape transforms Persephone from Demeter's daughter to Hades' wife. Persephone, as Queen of the Underworld, is quite different from the virgin Kore, or archetypal maiden. Her beauty is the resplendence of the most profound d epths of the feminine psyche. She is a powerful ruler of the dark region of the subcon scious. 3. Demeter: Earth Mother. Demeter/Persephone express the mother/ daughter mystery, which is a union of sames. It is the experience of the innermost dept hs of the feminine Self. Their reunion after the process of seasonal change turns the process int o a meaningful cyclic ritual which indicates that the individualized consciousnes s has assimilated the experience of man's common roots, but returns to the day world at the summon s of the spirit. Demeter, herself, is the most nurturing mother of the entir e pantheon. She represents the fertile soil of farm and garden. She endures her ne urotic, depressive suffering for the sake of suffering. She mourns. Her self-denial may exten d to self-indulgent regression away from connections with the divine, seeking refuge in everyd ay \"reality,\" Malkuth. \"...but entering into the figure of Demeter we realize the un iversal principle of life, which is to be pursued, raped, to fail to understand, to rage and grieve, bu t then to get everything back and be born again.\" (15) 4. Narcissus: the Self-Absorbed. The self-absorbed attitude reflec ts an alienated ego which is unrelated to itself. The frustrated yearning of this unrealized soul for self-possession, needs fulfillment not repression. As a union with the image in the de pths of the subconscious, narcissism is a way into the unconscious in the quest for individuality. Narcissus is in love with his own soul, and may be drowned, or fail to find a sui table object for his affection in the external world."},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"5. Pan: the Nature God. Pan corresponds with Malkuth through the insti nctual nature of man. He is seen as a devil by Christians who would confound this divine pr inciple with the shadow, and seek to repress it in themselves. This is especially eviden t in relationship to the instinctual approach/avoidance paradox of masturbation. Pan invented masturbati on. He was also conceived as the result of a shared fantasy between members of the s ame sex, a homosexual liason. Pan also corresponds with panic anxieties, and nightmare te rrors. Instinct is a release of tension through movement. Fantasy (Pan's nymphs) i s an accompaniment to masturbation. This activity makes us self-conscious. Pan links nature and psyche; he is an altogether imaginal form. 6. Gaia: the Earth. As the deep-breasted earth, Gaia is a personification of m atter = matrix = mother of Uranos, the starry heavens. She was also the mother of the Titans. Sh e supports all physical life; in fact, she is the material or physical body. S he is the somatic base of all psychosomatic phenomena, such as disease.

Jung/Commentary on The Secret of the Golden Flower The systems of both astrology and alchemy provide frameworks of imagery and correspondence. Conveying the images of the Astral Plane, they supply modes of working together for conscious and unconscious processes. Through them we can re ad a \"status report\" concerning what is otherwise unknowable. The practice of astrology or alchemy does not require \"belief\" or \"disbel ief.\" They are tools for making psyche matter. \"Faith is not what is believed, but that by wh ich it is believed.\" What can astrology do for you? The relationships of the planets in the solar system (including the sun, moon, and earth) create certain dynamic energy potenti als for change, growth, evolution, action, and transformation. This influence pervades everywh ere, including who we are and what we do. The cyclical movements of the solar sys tem define trends and patterns of trends. The true form of universal language is symbolism. The overlapping cycles of plan etary movement represent the living force of archetypal principles, and the dynamic geometrical relationships between them. This yields an experience of wholeness, i n which complete and unique constellations of archetypal energies and cyclic patterns of rela tionship manifest. All of this is examined through a \"horoscope\". The chart is a variation of the mandal a, or magickal circle. There are several kinds of horoscopes for different app lications. The primary form is the natal horoscope, or birth chart. It shows the dynamic poten tials with which you were born and which actuate your being. There is the horary horoscope which defines the same thing for anything at an y moment of time. There is the transit chart which compares your natal horoscope the c urrent potentials and changes. Transits represent external pressures of the current e nvironment. There is also a progressed chart, which purports to show your life's dynamic oppor tunities by examining the motions of the stars for the two or three months after your b irth, on the basis that 1 day = 1 year of life. Everything in astrology deals with interpreting the meaning of the planet ary relationships in these horoscopes. The planets in themselves create certain potent ials. Their angular relationships (aspects) affect the flow of these potentials. Their c yclical flow around the sun create different areas where these potentials are felt (the zodiac). The sum total of these relationships combines with the earth cycle (th e Houses, or field of experience) in a unique pattern for every different location, birth, and moment on earth. Each \"house\" is supposed to relate to a part of your being and life activity. Th e positions of the planets within the Houses provide different and unique potenti als for all of us.

This \"stuff\" one start s with corresponds to the inflated immaturities of one's own psyche. In the b eginning of the psychological process of individuation, the personal ego cannot distinguish i tself from the powers and abilities of the Collective Unconscious. S/he does not, for instance, realize that \"Mars trine Venus\" manifests in a characteristic manner for all who ar e in that archetypal domain; rather, the ego thinks, \"I am thus and such.\" The prima materia is our ego-Self identity, the residue of original infl ation, or identification with the subconscious. To submit this material to the alchemical process means to apply conscious effort and attention to the task: Refining and separat ing this composite mixture to the end that the Self or archetypal psyche will b e freed from its contamination with the ego. The composition of the ultima materia (end result) and prima materia ( beginning conditions) are essentially the same. The characteristic difference is that the conscious ego has distinguished itself from the contents of the Collective Un conscious, represented in Astrology by the dynamic interaction of the planets in the field of experie nce. He can distinguish \"himself\" from the various archetypes. This sets up a feedback system, which is access through the imaginal modes of astrology and alchemy, to Self-Realization. Th e aim is to unite with the well-springs of being. The birthchart forms a field of unfolding, rhythmical sequences. It d iscloses innate psychic attitudes and behavior patterns, and provides a fairly reliable method of tim ing life crises.

After the computations have been done, the data is entered onto a chart form and the erection of the natal chart is complete. The whole process should only take five to fifteen minutes with a bit of practice, or you may rely on astrological computer programs, using various house systems. The plane tary positions need to be known only to the nearest degree; the interpolation s can be done in one's head. In the example the only planet to change a degree or more was the moon . For placement on the natal chart, the planetary positions are rounded off to the ne arest degree. One should always check all the planetary movements for interpolations, bu t usually a quick mental scan is sufficient for accuracy to one degree. The foregoing instructions were for a birth west of Greenwich. If the bi rth was east of Greenwich, the same procedure would be followed except for one thing: the first correction factor (10 seconds per hour for time difference between Greenwich an d place of birth) would be a minus factor and would be subtracted from the other figures.

In typical \"Jungian\" style, his interest in alchemy developed from a vivid dream. Jung was amazed to find that the images and operations he encountered in the old alchemy text s related strongly to his theories of psychoanalysis and the unconscious. Therefore, hi s main research project at the culmination of his career was around this topic of alchemy and how it related to the process of consciousness. Jung saw in alchemy a metaph or of the process of individuation. Jung elaborated most of his alchemical analysis of the psyche in three major volumes of his Collected Works. They include Alchemical Studies, Psychology and Alchem y, and the final volume Mysterium Coniunctionis. Since the publication of these the re have been other works of interest produced by notable Jungian analysts. Among these are th e following: 1). Foremost are the works of Marie-Louise vonFranz; she has written Alch emical Active Imagination, Projection and Recollection in Jungian Psychology, Number and Time, an d Alchemy; An Introduction to the Symbolism and its Psychology, to name but a few . 2). Edward Edinger has given us the classical text, Ego and Archetype plus Psyc hotherapy and Alchemy. Other contributors include Henry Corbin with Spiritual Body and Ce lestial Earth, on Arabic alchemy, M. Esther Harding's Psychic Energy, Robert Grinnell's Alchemy in a Modern Woman, and Edward Whitmont's Psyche and Substance. Some of the mos t recent work has been done by avante garde psychologist James Hillman. He is director of t he Dallas Institute which specializes in Jungian Studies. His works appear in Spring, the Journal for Archetypal Psychology, and include pieces on the Anima Mundi, or Sou l of the World, and articles such as \"Silver and the White Earth.\" As its title sugges ts, Spring originated as a voice for archetypal psychology, but now most articles are in the perspective of Imaginal Psychology. Then there are the classical texts of alchemy, themselves. Among these n umber such as The Book of Lambspring, Aurora Consurgens, Codicillus (by Raymond Lully), Splendor Solis, Theatrum Chemicum, and The Alchemical Writings of Edward Kelly. Li ber Azoth and De Natura Rerum (among others) by Paracelsus. Other classics include T he Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkrutz and Rosarium Philosophorum which Jun g used to illustrate his work The Psychology of the Transference. Finally, there ar e the modern translations of older works by A. E. Waite which include Turba Philosophorum , The"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"Hermetic Museum, Lexicon of Alchemy, and The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus. Even newer are the compendiums such as The Secret Art o f Alchemy by Stanislas Klossowski De Rola and Alchemist's Handbook by Frater Alber tus. Another Jungian contribution is Eliade's The Forge & the Crucible. For the le sser known treatises, Jung's bibliographies are a gold mine. Jung wrote the forward to the Taoist class ic on alchemy, The Secret of the Golden Flower. Most of us, unfamiliar with the subtle nuances of alchemical practice, view it as the historical predecessor of some of our modern sciences, like medici ne, chemistry, metallurgy, etc. But, according to Jung's research, it seems to be much, much more. It is a curious fact that there is no single alchemy for us to examine. It is a cross-c ultural phenomena which has been practiced in various forms by ancient Egyptians, G reeks, Romans, Christian Europeans, and the Islamic, Hindu and Taoist faiths. Al l of these use symbols to depict a process of transformation, whether this process is t hought to occur inside (introverted) or outside (extroverted) of the human body. Although there are many types of alchemy, the main split seems to be between material (extrovert ed) and spiritual (introverted) alchemies. The deciding factor is the direction of th e practitioner's creativity. In his book, The Alchemical Tradition in the Late Twentieth Century, R ichard Grossinger summarizes the basic components of the different alchemies, which he dubs 'planet science.' These include the following: 1. A theory of nature as made up of primary elements. 2. A belief in the gradual evolution and transformation of substance. 3. A system for inducing transmutation. 4. The imitation of nature by a gentle technology. 5. The faith that one's inner being is changed by participation in external chemical experiments. 6. A general system of synchronistic correspondences between planets, he rbs, minerals, species of animals, signs and symbols, parts of the body, etc., known as the Doctri ne of Signatures. 7. Gold as the completed and perfected form of the metals, in specific , and substance in general (Alchemy is the attempt to transmute other substances into gol d, however that attempt is understood and carried out). 8. The existence of a paradoxical form of matter, sometimes called The Philosop her's Stone (the lapis), which can be used in making gold or in brewing elixirs and me dicines that have universal curative powers. 9. A method of symbolism working on the simultaneity of a series of complement ary pairs: Sun/Moon, Gold/Silver, Sulphur/Mercury, King/Queen, Male/Female, Hus band/Bride, Christ/Man, etc."},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"10. The search for magical texts that come from a time when the human race was closer to the source of things or are handed down from higher intelligences, extra -terrestials, guardians, or their immediate familiars during some Golden Age. These texts deal with the creation or synthesis of matter and are a blueprint for physical experimen tation in a cosmic context (as well as for personal development). They have been reinterpret ed in terms of the Earth's different epochs and nationalities. 11. In the Occident, alchemy is early inductive experimental science and is closely allied with metallurgy, pharmacy, industrial chemistry, and coinage. 12. In the Orient, alchemy is a system of meditation in which one's body is u nderstood as elementally and harmonically equivalent to the field of creation. (Betwe en East and West, the body may be thought of as a microcosm of nature, with its own deposits of seeds , elixirs, and mineral substances). 13. Alchemy is joined to astrology in a set of meanings that arise from the correspond ences of planets, metals, and parts of the body, and the overall belief in a cosmic tim ing that permeates nature. Thus, alchemy deals fundamentally with the basic mysteries of life as we ll as with transcendental mysticism. But its approach is neither abstract nor t heoretical, but experimental, in nature. Just who were the alchemists, and why are their contributions importan t to us today? The alchemists were the leading explorers of consciousness in medieval ti mes, and their research led to a vast improvement in the conditions of human life. Among th e more famous are Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, Nicholas Flammel, and Sir Isaac Newt on. Their contributions not only improved the lives of their contemporaries, but influenced the thought of many philosophers if the same and later eras, such as Meister Eck hart, Thomas a Kempis, John Dee, Johannes Kepler, Thomas Vaughn, Bishop Berkeley, Emanuel Swedenborg, William Blake, and Geothe. The contributions of these eminent alchemists are staggering: Albe rtus Magnus, alone, wrote eight books on physics, six on psychology, eight on astronomy, twenty-six on zoology, five on minerals, one on geography, and three on life in general from an Aristoteli an point- of-view. He was a Dominican friar who was canonized a saint in 1931. Paracelsus was a Swiss born in 1493. His accomplishments were many and include being t he first modern medical scientist. He fathered the sciences of microchemistry, anti sepsis, modern wound surgery, and homeopathy. He wrote the first medical literature on the cause s and treatment of syphilis and epilepsy, as well as books on illness derived from adverse working conditions. Notwithstanding this accurate scientific bent, his work is in close ac cord with the mystical alchemical tradition. He wrote on furies in sleep, on ghosts appearing after death, on gnomes in mines and underground, of nymphs, pygmies, and magical salamanders . His word view was animistic. Invisible forces were always at work and the ph ysician had to constantly be aware of this fourth dimension in which he was moving. He ut ilized various techniques for divination and astrology as well as magical amulets, talisman s, and"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"incantations. He believed in a vital force which radiated around every man l ike a luminous sphere and which could be made to act at a distance. He is also credited wi th the early use of what we now know as hypnotism. He believed that there was a star in each man . (Mishlove). This sentiment was echoed by 19th century magician and alchem ist, Aleister Crowley, who said, \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" This alludes to the essen tial Self. Kepler developed the laws of planetary motion. But he developed his t heories on the basis of explorations into the dimly lit archetypal regions of man's mind as surel y as on his mathematical observations of the planetary motions. He was clearly a studen t in the tradition of earlier mystic-scientist such as Pythagoras and Paracelsus . Thomas Vaughn, Robert Fludd and Sir Frances Bacon number among the 17th century Rosic rucians, who practiced not only alchemy, but also other hermetic arts and the qabala. Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was a mathematical genius, as well as one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. He discovered the binomial theorem, invented differential calculus, made the first calculations of the moon's attraction by the eart h and described the laws of motion of classical mechanics, and formulated the theory of universal gravitation. He was very careful not to publish anything which was not firmly supported by experimental proofs or geometrical demonstration thus he exemplifi ed and ushered in the Age of Reason. However, if we look at Newton's own personal notes and diaries, over a million wor ks in his own handwriting, a startlingly different picture of the man emerges. Ne wton was an alchemist. He devoted himself to such endeavors as the transmutation of met als, the philosopher's stone, and the elixir of life. He was intensely introspec tive and had great mental endurance. He solved problems intuitively and dressed them up i n logical proofs afterwards. He, himself, was astounded by the startling nature of his own t heories. Gravity is a problem that still hasn't been dealt with satisfactorily by scient ists. His followers, however, emphasized his mechanistic view of the univers e to the exclusion of his religious and alchemical views. In a sense, their action ushered in a con troversy in psychical research which has existed ever since. Since Newton's tim e, all discoveries suggesting the presence of a spiritual force which transcended time or space were ironically considered to be a violation of Newton's Laws--even though Newton himself h eld these very beliefs! It is interesting to note, that today scientists actually can turn small amou nts of lead into gold through particle acceleration, since they are only one atomic weight apart . Despite the advances in science, the \"unknown\" is still projected into the re alm of matter, and the alchemical quest continues. Science is still debating over what is ph ysical, what is psychic and what is metapsychic. VonFranz, in Projection and Recollection in Jungi an Psychology, states that \"In Western cultural history the transpsychic has been d escribed sometimes as \"spirit\" sometimes as \"matter.\" Theologians and philosophers are mor e concerned with the former, physicists with the later.\" Von Franz points out that \"what was once regarded as the opposition between s pirit and matter turns up again in contemporary physics as a discussion of the relati on between"},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"consciousness (or \"Mind\") and matter.\" It bears on such questions as t he bias of the observer, and the theories of relativity, probability, synchronicity, not to ment ion the whole field of parapsychology. Jung really returned us to the alchemistic viewpoin t when he said, in Aion: Sooner or later nuclear physics and the psychology of the unconscious will draw closely together as both of them independently of one another and from opposite directions, push forward into transcendental territory. ...Psyche cannot be tot ally different from matter for how otherwise could it move matter? And matte r cannot be alien to psyche, for how else could matter produce psyche? Psyche and matter exist in the same world, and each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal action would be impossible. If research could only advance far enough, therefore, we should arri ve at an ultimate agreement between physical and psychological concepts. Our presen t attempts may be bold, but I believe they are on the right lines. As VonFranz notes, \"There is therefore no concept fundamental to moder n physics that is not in one degree or another a differentiated form of some primordial archet ypal idea.\" These include our concepts of time, space, energy, the field of force, part icle theory, and chemical affinity. Laws in physics are subject to scientific revolutions and there has be en a major breakthrough in paradigm shifts about every 20 years, or each generation. VonFranz says, \"As soon as an archetypal idea that has been serving as a model no longer coincides w ith the observed facts of the external world, it is dropped or its origin in the p syche is recognized. This process always coincides...with the upward thrust of a ne w thought-model from the unconscious to the threshold of consciousness.\" This is basically the process of weeding out \"scientific errors.\" \" ...scarcely a thought is given to what they might mean, psychologically, once they are no longer fit to serve as a model in describing the outer world.\" This certainly happened to alche my, until Jung revived an interest in it. \"It is only today, when we know that the assump tions of the observer decisively precondition the total results, that the question i s becoming acute.\" Physicists have become increasingly conscious of the extent to which p sychological circumstances influence their results. Other experimental-minded persons have sought the mysteries of lif e and divinity within their own bodies, since ancient times. Whether known as Yogis or Adepts , their goal was basically the same, as we shall see. Some modern schools of the Hermetic Arts see an identity between m edieval European alchemy and the eastern practice of Yoga. They see a metaphysical or symbol correspondence between the planetary and metallurgical attributions o f alchemy and the chakras. Yoga is also experimental in nature. The qualities of the metals corre spond to the planets and chakras as follows: Lead Saturn Sacral Plexus Iron Mars Prostatic Ganglion Tin Jupiter Solar Plexus Gold Sun Cardiac Plexus"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"Copper Venus Pharyngeal Plexus Silver Moon Pituitary Body Quicksilver Mercury Pineal Gland"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"Alchemy is not concerned exclusively with consciousness, but also seeds the subtle transformation of the body, so that the physical level is also brought into perf ect equilibrium. Thus, the alchemical metals may be considered analogous t o the chakras of the yogis. We can draw another parallel among the three major principles of Alc hemy and those of Yoga, which are known as the Gunas. Mercury..........Sattva Sulphur............Rajas Salt.................Tamas The quality of Mercury is vital and reflective; it equates with the sp iritual principles of goodness and intelligence; Sattva guna is illuminative. The quality of Sulph ur is fiery and passionate like the principle of Rajas, which incites desire, attachm ent, and action. The quality of Salt is arrestive and binding, and reflects the gross inerti a of matter, which is much like Tamas. These gunas and the three alchemical substances symbol ize spirit, soul and body. Another \"alchemical\" way the gunas were applied concerns food: satt vic foods incline one toward meditation and the spiritual life (fruits, vegetable s, and grains); rajasic foods are stimulating (i.e. spicy food); tamasic food incites the baser insti ncts (animal flesh). The concept of four basic elements, harmonized in a fifth, is also common to b oth alchemy and yoga doctrine. The Indian elements are known as Tattvas. They are: Akasha (quintessence; Tejas or Agni (fire); Apas (water); Vayu (air); Pri thivi (earth). Furthermore, the preparation for the practice of both alchemy and yoga requir es a moral or ethical preparation. Both stress that evil tendencies should be over come while positive virtues are developed. This includes both behavior and the purificat ion of the various body centers. The objective is not wealth, but health or wholeness. Alchemy also speaks of a \"secret fire\", which is often compared to a serpen t or dragon. Here again, we find the correspondence to Kundalini, the serpent-power . Alchemy is performed by the aid of Mercury, the illuminative principle, and the powe rs of the sun and moon. The yogic system works in three channels in the subtle body of man. One equates with the sun, another with the moon. They are called ida and pingala. The th ird, or harmonizing channel, is known as sushumna, and is associated with illumin ation. The yogi seeks to arouse the latent power of the Kundalini serpent so it ris es up the chakra centers until it opens the third eye of mystical vision and illuminat ion. Alchemists apply slow heat to their alchemical vessel to sublimate and refine the conten ts therein. The yogis use breath control, the alchemist bellows to control the fire. Interes tingly, yogis have breath exercises called \"breath of fire\" and \"the bellows.\" In summary, the points of correspondence resulting in the alchemical p roduction of a new kind of human being (one made hale or whole) are as follows: 1. Both systems agree that all things are expressions of one fundamental ener gy."},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"2. Both affirm that all things combine three qualities: a. Wisdom, Sattva, superconsciousness or Mercury; b. Desire, Rajas, compulsion or Sulpher ; c. Inertia, Tamas, darkness, or Salt. 3. Both recognize five modes of expression: Akasha, Spirit or the quintessen ce; Tejas or Agni (fire); Apas (water); Vayu (air); Prithivi (earth). 4. Both systems mention seven principle vehicles of activity, called chak ras by yogis, and metals by alchemists. 5. Both say there is a secret force, fiery in quality, which is to be raised from on e chakra or metal to another, until the power of all seven is sublimated in t he higher. 6. Yoga says 1) Prana or Surya, sun, 2) Rayim, moon, and 3) Sattva, wisdom are the three main agencies in the work (or ida, pingala and sushumna). Alchemy says th e whole operation is a work of the sun and moon, aided by Mercury. 7. Both systems stress preparation by establishing physical purity and et hical freedom from lust, avarice, vanity, attachment, anger and other anti-social tendencies. 8. Both allege that success enables the adepts to exercise extraordinary power s, to heal all diseases, and to control all the forces of nature so as to exert a determi ning influence on circumstances. In short, what both alchemist and yogi do is 1). to recognize what goes on in his body, and 2). to use his knowledge of the control exerted over subconscious processe d by self- consciousness to form a definite intention that this body-building f unction shall act with maximum efficiency creating increased vitality. This supercharge of lib ido then wakens the spiritual vision of the pineal gland to full activity. The Great Work of alche my consists of stabilizing the vision of Light into a full realization. The by-product i s that the body- building power of the subconscious changes the alchemist himself in to a new creature. Jung asserted that the medieval alchemists were unaware of the natural pr ocess of psychological transformation which went on in their subconscious. Ther efore, they projected this process into their experiments. In other words, they pr ojected an inner process outside of themselves. Had they been more conscious in their int ent, or more sophisticated in their psychology like the yogis, they would have been more consistently successful. But why is a study of alchemy relevant to our modern lives? We are not daily occupie d in pseudo-alchemical experiments like the alchemists, or are we? In many m etaphorical ways we are thinking like alchemists all the time. Also, Jung observed that the d reams of his clients repeatedly stressed the main alchemical themes, especial ly the conflict and union of opposites. The alchemical symbolism is widespread in dreams if modern i ndividuals, and can shed light on these more primitive aspects of our subconscious li fe. It is important for our understanding of our own unconscious. In Alchemical Active Imagi nation, VonFranz states:"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"True knowledge of oneself is the knowledge of the objective psyche as it manife sts in dreams and in the manifestations of the unconscious. Only by looking at dreams, f or instance, can one see who one truly is; they tell us who we really are, that i s something which is objectively there. To meditate on that is an effort towards self-kn owledge, because that is scientific and objective and not in the interest of the ego but in the interest of \"what I am\" objectively. It is knowledge of the Self, of the wi der, objective personality. We could view alchemy as an antique form of therapy, which originally had the mean ing 'to heal,' and the implication of 'service to the gods.' Psychotherapy basicall y means service to the psyche, and offers us a way to reconnect with our unconscious, thus exper iencing wholeness. It also opens an avenue to increased physical health, since those ailments which remain unconscious often manifest as psychosomatic diseases. If we beco me conscious of the source of the dis-ease, it dissipates. Knowledge of alchemy's symboli sm can lead us to psychological insight in terms of our own condition, especially that reflec ted in dreams. Alchemy may be carried out as either a physical or mental operation. The Jungi an orientation is primarily mental, though it might take a physical form. For exa mple, you might choose to ritually \"act out\" certain aspects of the Great Work in active imagination. The Jungian interpretation that alchemy is a passive and unconscious proc ess comes from a basically mental, or Greek orientation. The type of alchemy that aims at rejuve nating or preserving the physical body is descended from the physically-oriente d Egyptian alchemy. The main traditions of conscious, inner spiritual alchemy come mainl y from the Islamic and Oriental philosophies. Jung's original interest in alchemy came from a dream he had of a library fi lled with arcane tomes from medieval times and the Renaissance. During the next 15 ye ars he spent collecting this library, he learned to recognize the major symbols of the unconscious. He was reading about them in alchemy books and hearing about them in his patients ' dreams and fantasies. Their projections told him of an inner quest, a sealed vess el, the conflict of opposites, a philosophical tree, a fountain of eternity, a golden flower, a Stone, a sac red wedding, etc. Slowly Jung familiarized himself with their alchemical meaning. Then he, himself, became a living symbol of the healing power of the Philosopher's Stone. In his case t his power manifested as the ability to heal on the mental level--in other words, to re lease any blocks hindering the natural process of growth and transformation. When proceedin g in the direction of their individuation with self-realization. We should be careful here not to dichotomize between \"mental\" and \"physical\" too much or we will lose our proper alchemical perspective. Alchemy cannot be reduced to a metaphor of psyc hological or philosophical transformation--it requires first-hand experimen tation. Grossinger says that \" what Carl Jung recognized was that the stages if the alchemists also corresponded to a process of psychological individuation. The psychic stages were as pre cise and rigorous as the chemical ones by which they became imaginal. Furthermore, t hey generated a physical and even quantitative terminology for an undiagnosed tension of opposites in the human psyche arising from male and female archetypes, a stru ggle they sought to resolve by the creative unity of the chemicals in the Stone. \" Alchemy sought to"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"unite Spirit (male), and Matter (female) through a Royal Union (coniunct io) to create their synthesis in the homunculus, hermaphrodite, or lapis. This is an alchem ical metaphor of the process of spiritual rebirth. The entire body of alchemical literature covers many variations on the them e of the Great Work. No single person will ever express all of the operations and symbols desc ribed in alchemy, just as no single person ever embodies the totality of the Self. We each have unique experiences of the common roots of humanity or the collect ive unconscious. Thus, the various operations of alchemy come in different ord er for the various practitioners. The alchemical writings seem to contradict one an other about the evolution of the process. Likewise, in dreams, we sometimes find the sym bols of the end- product (like a mandala, or flower, or child) appearing at the beginning of the p rocess. They symbolize what is latent and seeks manifestation. Nevertheless in both alchemy and Jungian psychology there are classic stages i n the process of individuation or personal experience of the unconscious. One major recu rrent theme in modern dreams is the symbolism of the planets, which correspond with the alchemical metals. These metals, or planets (astrology), or Spheres (QBL) can be under stood psychologically as the building blocks of the ego, which forms itself from f ragments of these divine, archetypal qualities. These spiritual principles seek concr etization through the unique experience of an individual ego. This links spirit and matter. The sacredness of the Opus, or Great Work, is the central idea behind alc hemy. One must be self-oriented, rather than ego-oriented. The adept is also diligent, p atient and virtuous. In other words, in order to create the Stone, you must have the potential with in yourself for self-realization--for becoming whole or 'holy.' It requires an inward see king, just like the process of individuation. It is a solitary talk for no one may follow where you go. But t here may be guides who will help inspire your faith and dedication to the task. O thers have been to the territory you will explore, but none will accompany you. The secret of alchemy is that it is a personal journey of transformation, and can not be explained but only experienced. It is \"eating the dish\", not just readin g about it in an alchemical cookbook. Its effects must be channeled into spiritual growth , for if alchemy is used to gratify personal desire the work is lost. This means the ego gets infl ated with its own importance when the real power source lies within the Self. This naturally produces a regression back into an unconscious state, back to the prima materia. The i nstinctual urge for growth and transformation lies within us. For this urge to be considere d evolutional requires that the ego must cooperate quite deliberately and consciousl y with the Self. This leads toward self-realization. The main purpose of the Opus is \"to create a transcendent, miraculous su bstance which is variously symbolized as the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of Life, or the un iversal medicine (panacea). The procedure is, first, to find the suitable mater ial, the so-called prima materia, and then to subject it to a series of operations which wi ll turn it into the Philosopher's Stone.\" (Edinger, 1978). The First Matter is a homogenous unity o f Mercury, Sulpher and Salt. It is therefore 'three,' but can also be expressed as 'f our' elements, which are again essentially 'one.' Jung felt that the secret of the psyche was contain ed in this"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"question of the 'three' and the 'four.' In alchemy it is expressed as t he axiom of Maria Prophetissa: \"Therefore the Hebrew prophetess cried without res traint: 'one becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the One as the fourth.'\" Tod ay, physicists echo this statement when they call 'plasma' both the fourth and first st ate of matter (the others being liquid, gas and solid). In Jungian psychology, the prima materia is the original undifferentiated condition of ordinary consciousness, which is really unconsciousness. Mystics of all times have repeated that in the ordinary state we are all asleep or even \"dead\" to the true Realit y. In psychology the four-fold nature of the prima materia is expressed by the f our functions which correspond with the alchemical elements: intuition (fir e), thinking (air), feeling (water), and sensation (earth). In Jungian theory we have a dominant function and limited access to one or two others, but the fourth function is inaccessible, malad apted or hard to integrate. It is what keeps us from \"getting it all together.\" Thus, we are ou t-of-balance. Balancing the four functions means achieving an integrated personality, balan ce, and high well-being. This requires undergoing a symbolic process of the union of op posites, which is what both alchemy and Jungian analysis are all about. Both alchemy and Jungian psychology require a period of depth analysis (solutio) to distinguish the or iginal, undifferentiated contents. The ego learns what part of the personality com es from itself and which parts from the Self. It reflects on its own components parts ( subpersonalities) and learns to see itself as a small part of a greater whole, the larger unity of the Se lf. Edinger says, \"The fixed, settled aspects of the personality which are rigid and s tatic are reduced or led back to their original, undifferentiated condition as part of the proc ess of psychic transformation,\" i.e. back to a state of 'innocence.' Further, Edinger compares the problem of discovering the prima materi a to the problem of finding what to work on in psychotherapy. He gives some hints: (1) It is ubiquitous, to be found everywhere, before the eyes of all. This m eans that psychotherapeutic material likewise is everywhere, in all the ordinary , everyday occurrences of life. Moods and petty personal reactions of all kinds are suitable mat ter to be worked on by the therapeutic process. (2) Although of great inward value, the prima materia is vile in outer appearance an d therefore despised, rejected and thrown on the dung heap. The prima materia is tr eated like the suffering servant in Isaiah. Psychologically, this means that t he prima materia is found in the shadow, that part of the personality which is considered most despicable. Those aspects of ourselves most painful and most humiliating are t he very ones to be brought forward and worked on. (3) It appears as a multiplicity, \"has as many names as there are things,\" but at the same time is one. This feature corresponds to the fact that initially psyc hotherapy makes one aware of his fragmented, disjointed condition. Very gradually these warr ing fragments are discovered to be differing aspects of ones underlying unity. It i s as though one sees the fingers of a hand touching a table at first only in two dime nsions, as separate unconnected fingers. With three-dimensional vision, the fin gers are seen as part of a larger unity, the hand."},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"(4) The prima materia is undifferentiated, without definite boundaries, li mits or form. This corresponds to a certain experience of the unconscious which exposes the ego to the infinite...It may evoke the terror of dissolution or the awe of eterni ty. It provides a glimpse of the pleroma,...the chaos prior to the operation of the World-creating Logos. It is the fear of the boundless that often leads one to be content with the ego-li mits he has rather than risk falling into the infinite by attempting to enlarge them . The different operations to transform the prima materia follow as the nat ural consequence of finding the material to work on. The imagery associated with these operation s is profuse and draws from myth, religion, and folklore. The symbols for all these imager y-systems comes from the collective unconscious. There is no set number of alch emical operations, just as there is no set number or order to archetypes. However, certain of the operations seem to recur more often in the liter ature and experience. We could consider these as the skeletal frame of the alchem ical process. Their order switches around also. Edinger lists seven operations which seem t o typify the major transformations of the alchemical process. These include: calcinati o, solutio, coagulatio, sublimatio, mortificatio, seperatio, and coniunctio. Other major operation s include nigredo, albedo, rubedo, solificatio, multiplicatio, projectio, separatio, circ ulatio, and more. We can detail the nature of each of these operations later. For now it is enough t o grasp the overview, which is best stated by Jung, himself, in Mysterium Coniunction is: \"...the alchemist saw the essence of his art in separation and analysis [solve or sol utio] on the one hand and synthesis and consolidation [coagula or coagulatio] on the other. For h im there was first of all an initial state in which opposite tendencies or forc es were in conflict; secondly there was the great question of a procedure which would be capabl e of bringing the hostile elements and qualities, once they were separated, back to uni ty again. The initial state, named chaos, was not given from the start but had to be sought for as the prima materia. And just as at the beginning of the work was not self-evi dent, so to an even greater degree was its end. There are countless speculations on the natur e of the end state, all of them reflected in it designations. The commonest are the ideas of i ts permanence (prolongation of life, immortality, incorruptibility), its androgyny, its spir ituality and corporality, its divinity and its resemblance to man (homunculus).\" He goes on to point out what this might man psychologically. We could view it as conflicting drives originating on the spiritual, mental, emotional, and physi cal levels creating splits in the personality. Jung says that, \"The obvious analogy, in the ps ychic sphere, to this problem of opposites is the dissociation of the person ality brought about by the conflict of incompatible tendencies, resulting as a rule from an inh armonious disposition. The repression of one of the opposites leads only to a prolongation and extension of the conflict, in other words, to a neurosis. The therapist ther efore confronts the opposites with one another and aims at uniting them permanently. The i mages of the goal which then appear in dreams often run parallel with the correspondi ng alchemical symbols.\" He reiterates the value of accessing the alchemical symbolism for incre asing insight. \"Investigation of the alchemical symbolism, like a preoccupation with m ythology, does not"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"lead one away from life any more than a study of comparative anatomy leads away from the anatomy of the living man. On the contrary, alchemy affords us a veritable tr easure- house of symbols, knowledge of which is extremely helpful for an underst anding of neurotic and psychotic processes. This, in turn, enables us to apply the psychology of the unconscious to those regions in the history of the human mind which are con cerned with symbolism.\" Each of the operations of alchemy functions as the center of focus of an elab orate symbol- system. Other symbols which are related to the operation cluster around the theme of the operation--they share a common essence. These central symbols provide b asic categories which we can use to understand our own personal psychic life, and even th e transformation processes of others. Taken together, the alchemical operations illustrat e almost all of the full range of experiences which are involved in the process of individu ation. As Grossinger points out, \"Alchemy is thus a form of chemical research in to which unresolved psychic elements were projected. The alchemical nigredo , the initial phase of the operation which produces 'black blacker than black,' is also an inte rnal experience of melancholia, an encounter with the shadow.\" But this is also the necessar y first stage in Jungian analysis--confronting that which has been rejected or repress ed is essential to becoming whole. This realm of the shadow can often provide more real substanc e for the spiritual quest than mimicking the teachings of a spiritual master wit hout really changing oneself. Though stumbling around in the dark seems frustrating, if it is honest and heartfelt, and one really grapples with the shadow problem, the way is cleare d for progress that will be sustained by a firm foundation gained in the early phases. Throughout the alchemical process, the lapis functions as an inner guide b y presenting itself in diverse symbolism. It symbolizes the growing manifestation o f your latent potential for wholeness. It frequently manifests in mandala symbolism. This incl udes such forms as a revolving wheel or the zodiac, the petals of a magnificent flower, or a serpent eat ing its tail. As a grand union of opposites, it symbolizes the unification of king and que en, man and wife, conscious and unconscious, personality and society, etc. in a royal union c alled the Marriage of the Sun and Moon in alchemy. Alchemy is a means of understanding our unconscious projections of archetypes into the world. In \"Spiritual Development as Reflected in Alchemy and Related Disci ples,\" Rudolf Bernoulli summarizes the basics of extroverted and introverted alchem y. He says, \"There are two kinds of alchemy: one strives to know the cosmos as a whole and to recreat e it; it is in a sense the precursor of modern natural science. It aspires to create gold as the supreme perfection in this sphere...The other alchemy strives higher; it stri ves for the great wonder, the wonder of all wonders, the magic crystal, the philosopher's stone.\" This is not a substance susceptible of chemical analysis. It does not repres ent a spiritual or psychological state that can be reduced to a clear formula. It is some thing more than perfection, something through which perfection can be achieve d. It is the universal instrument of magic. By it we can attain to the ultimate. By it we can completely possess the world. By it we can make ourselves free from the w orld, by soaring above it. this is alchemy in the mystical sense...The goal is reached on ly when a"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"man succeeds in creating the...stone within himself, and this is made poss ible only by the intervention of the 'inner master.'\" i.e. the Self. --von Franz, Psychic Energy , p. 452-3 Psychologically...the union of body and spirit or of conscious and unconscious can be safely attempted only when both have undergone a purification brought about by the e arlier stages of analysis, in which the conscious character and the personal unconsc ious are reviewed and set in order. In the alchemistic literature there is evidence that the myster ious coniunctio took place in three stages. The first is that of the union of opposites, the double con juntion, which chiefly concerns us here. The second stage effects a triple union, that of body, s oul, and spirit; or, as it is said elsewhere, \"the Trinity is reduced to a Unity.\" In the Book of Lambspring, published in 1625, this triple union is represented first by two fishes swimming in the sea, pictured with the legend, \"The sea is th e Body, the two fishes are the Soul and the Spirit\", and later by a second picture showing a deer and a u nicorn in a forest, with the following text: In the Body [the forest] there is Soul [the deer] and Spirit [the un icorn]...He that knows how to tame and master them by art, and to couple them together, may justly be called a master, for we rightly judge that he has attained the golden flesh. The literature offers far less material about this more advanced stage of the work than about the simple coniunctio, and still less about the third stage, the un ion of the four elements, from which the fifth element, the \"quintessence,\" ari ses. However, Jung's latest works are largely concerned with the problems of this fourfold coniunc tio, through which not only are the personal parts of the psyche--ego and anima, or ego and animus-- consummated, but these, in a further stage of development, are in turn unit ed with their transpersonal correlates--wise man and prophetess, or great mother and m agician (under whatever names these superordinate elements are conceived. ...The subj ect is by no means simple, but it amply repays careful study. b. Alchemical Imagination: Making Psyche Matter We should now proceed to find a neutral, or unitarian, language in which every concept we use is applicable as well to the unconscious as to matter, in order to overcome this wrong view that the unconscious psyche and matter are two thi ngs. --Professor Wolfgang Pauli In the alchemical search for the God-head in matter (Kether in Malku th), Paracelsus contended that matter was a living counterpart of the creating deity. A sys tem of correspondences is the foundation of alchemy. The conception of a primal ev ent manifested in different fields is fundamental to alchemy. The process in the re tort vessel is analogous to the process of transformation of the psyche. Through alchemy, we can perceive the parallels between microcosm, universe, and man. Alchemy is based on the as sumption that the equation world = man = God is Truth."},{"pageNumber":914,"pageContent":"The metaphysical perception of alchemy grew in the Jungian school of psyc hology. It emphasizes the process of psychological transformation. This is the Op us, or Great Work of alchemy. It is given this appellation because that which \"works\" is th at which has the power to transform. The experiments are performed on oneself. This renew s the alchemical philosophy which is primarily concerned with the union of psyche and matter. There is an indissoluble unity in alchemy between theory and practice. They are e xplicate aspects (which are experienced through a metaphorical sensory perception) of th e Quest, or attainment of immortality through the union of opposites. Thus, the goal of the Opus is precisely this union, which is known as the Philosopher's Stone, Royal M arriage, or Unus Mundus (experience of one world view uniting psyche/body/spirit). Paracelsus described alchemy as the voluntary action of man in harmony with the involuntary action of nature. If the center of the creative process takes pl ace in the \"heart of man\", his intentions take on profound significance. They can now influe nce the destiny of the cosmos. Attainment of this state is known as the production of the Di amond Body. Alchemy strives for the experience of spiritual rebirth via the union of opposites, or the sacred marriage. The sacred marriage is characterized as the union of th e Sun (+0 and Moon (-). These polarized positions may be symbolized variously as positive-negat ive; male-female; god-devil; spirit-matter; father-mother; etc. The sac red marriage, or coniunctio, creates a bond by which opposites are united in an image which transcends both original potentials. The whole art of alchemy is contained within the image (implicate order) of a magical or divine child. There is an inherent paradox in alchemy: all the while stressing redemp tion of the physical body, or matter, alchemy is actively striving toward creation of a subtle, immortal bod y, which has no apparent physical basis (magical child = body of light). This central problem in alchemy is the spiritual redemption of the p hysical body. Alchemy requires resurrection of the soul of body. The challenge one encounters is to \"see through\" to a unified vision of mundane physical processes with spiritual values . This develops awareness of the ordering processes inherent in matter. The solution is to visualize the physical body as a metaphor for psychic transformation. [INSERT DRAWING; ALCHEMICAL TREE] . ..the mystery of the structure of the universe, was in themselves, in their own bodies and in that part of the personality which we call the unconscious, but they woul d say in the life of their own material existence...They thought that instead of takin g outer materials you could just as well look inside and get information directly from that mystery because you were it. After all, you too were a part of the mystery of cosm ic existence, so you could just as well watch it directly. Even further, you c ould ask matter, the mystery of which you consist, to tell you what it is, to reveal itself to you. Instead of treating it like a dead object to be thrown into a vessel and then cooked in order to see what came out, you could just as well take a block of iron, for instance, and ask it what it was, what its kind of life was, what it was doing, how it felt when melted. But since all these materials are within you, you can also contact th em directly and in that way they contacted what we would now call the collective unconsc ious,"},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"which to them was also projected into the inner aspect of their own bodies. The y consulted these powers directly through what they called meditation and the refore most of these introverted alchemists always stressed the fact that one shoul d not only experiment outwardly but should always insert phases of introversion with pr ayer and meditation and a kind of yoga. With yoga meditation you try to get the right hypothesis, or information, about what you are doing or about the materials. Or you can, for instance, talk to quicksilver, or to iron, and if you talk to quicksilver and iron then naturally the unconscious fills up the gap by a personification. Then Mercur y appears to you and tells you who the sun God is. A power, the soul of Gold, appears and tells you who and what it is . (16) So, we see that basically the dynamic impulses of the original alchemists an d modern physicists is the same. Namely, to find out all that is possible about how G od works. This Opus, or Work, is understood as taking place in a sealed retort vessel. T he nature of this vessel is the origin of the common-use term, \"Hermetically sealed.\" This containment insures that none of the ingredients will be lost, and also provides a contai ner in which the contents are slowly heated, or cooked (calcinatio). The initial material (pri ma materia) then goes through several stages of transformation, defined as operations. These are not always presented in the same sequence in alchemical texts. Most, however, in clude sublimatio (seperating), and coniunctio (uniting). There are also operations of circul ating, multiplying, and reiterating. The meditatio, or meditation, consists of inner dialogue with the alche mical figures: Saturn=lead; Luna=silver; Sol=gold; Mercury=quicksilver; Venus=copp er; Mars=iron; Jupiter=tin. Because the process of alchemy does not extend into God-Realiz ation. This does not exclude this from occurring through God's grace, however. Then Ket her is in Malkuth, the beginning (prima materia) and end (ultima materia) are One. In alchemy, the Anima Mundi, or Soul of the World acts as the soul-guide to the highest region. We experience An-imaginal (Anima-ginal) Reality. [INSERT PICTURE; ULTIMA MATERIA] Always remember that the body is of vital importance in any alchemical oper ation. To transcend somewhere out of the body is not alchemical practice; rath er, imagine the body NOWHERE, or now-here. Alchemy is ...a physiological mythology juxtaposed with a cosmogonic mythology. In between is the psyche itself-the arcane substance, the subjective factor-which achieves a personified level in the divinities of mythology. It is the psyche's own image-making activity, its self-creation through symbols, that is central to this model. It represents a process of the \"psychization of instinct,\" the transformation of instin ctual and biophysical phenomena into psychic experience. These phenomena can then t o a certain extent be brought within the range of conscious will and reason. In thi s process instinct loses some of its primordial autonomy. It is an opus contra natura m, so to speak...Alchemy accordingly gives us a model for the psychology of projection; it point s at once \"upward\" and \"downward.\" It is radically symbolic in its insistence on the \"arcanum.\" And finally, in the obligation it imposed for the careful elaborat ion of"},{"pageNumber":916,"pageContent":"theoria, it included the formation of apperceptive concepts and symbols as a fundamental part of the opus . (17) What happens to body/soul at the level of Malkuth? The process of alchemical in itiation begins with the stage known as Mortificatio, or psychological masochism. This is the disintegration of the conscious personality. It is specifically a religious crisis in the life of the individual, where ruling ideas lose their meaning. Needless to say, th is is a depressing state of being. This depression is imaged in terms of \"blackening\" and h as, therefore, to do with the Shadow. The actual process occurs on XXI. The Universe, which c orresponds with the Nigredo. To derive pleasure from punishing one's body is a curious pathological image. T he unheroic, self-humiliation is a form of masochism with a religious aim: to gain forgiveness through a mode of redemption. This dedication to suffering produces meanin g, compassion, humility, and healing. This is a discipline of the soul which c ontradicts the ego attitude. There is a relationship between ritual flogging in initiation cerem onies and the intoxication of masochistic mortification. The participant is entranced and enter s the transformative process. The combination of humiliation and pleasure yields an experien ce of ambivalence, a primal condition of psyche. Mortificatio is a psychological operation, not a moral one. We cannot apply a moral frame of reference to it; it is neither good nor bad, better nor worse. It is a ne cessary, just-so operation. One alchemical text advises, \"Take the old black spirit and destroy and torture it...\" Another philosopher tells us that \"The tortured thing, when it is immersed in the body, changes it into an unalterable and indestructible nature.\" So the operation is necessary, not to make us morally better or spiritually purer, bu t rather to change us. When we immerse masochistic material in the body of fantasy, psyc he and psychic reality become indestructible. The operation is necessary, not for t he sake of moral ego-strengthening, but to make hard psychic reality. If we could fully re alize this, that mortification is a way into the weighty, heavy matter of the sou l, it might help us get past the momentary cringe. For we cringe and shrink at the moment of realization, at the reality of psyche where there is no ego-control, especiall y in its ugliness or banality. (18) Do not confuse masochism, which is a religious attitude to suffering, wit h martyrdom, which is a manifestation of the neurotic, heroic ego. The movement from martyrdom to masochism is also a movement from guilt to sha me, and this movement has the quality of depth. Guilt is primarily an ego phenomen on, while shame is a quality of the soul. The antidote for guilt is not always forgiveness; it lies rather in the perception of the archetypal dimension in which the ego is caught. G uilt implies the possibility of rectification, of righting the wrong; hence the ego-protes ts and justifications which are variations on the martyr's theme: \"Well, I'm trying!\" and \"You m ake me feel guilty,\" and \"If I only had more will-power.\""},{"pageNumber":917,"pageContent":"But shame belongs to the dimension of soul, and implies the permanence of a deficiency, the impossibility of rectification (and also of justification) . It is the sense of permanent lack, insufficiency, inadequacy, which cannot be made right or corr ected by any activity of the ego--no amount of will power, strivings for perfection, or w ithdrawal of demands from other people will do the trick. In its very nature, its \"natural state\", the soul is incomplete, and the experience of its incompleteness is the experience of shame. Guilt is a moral category, shame belongs to psychological experience and the experience of psyche. (19) 4. ORIENTATION/EXERCISE a. The Banishing Ritual and Psychological Orientati on In the realm of sacred space, its most striking manifestation is religious man's will to take his stand at the very heart of the real, at the center of the World, that is, e xactly where the cosmos came into existence and began to spread out toward the four horizons, and where, there is possibility of communication with the gods, w here he is closest to the gods. Every religious man places himself at the Center of the World and by the same token at the very source of absolute reality, as close as possible to the opening that ensures him communication with the gods. --Mircea Eliade/ The Sacred and the Profane The Banishing Ritual and Middle Pillar Exercise are particularly effe ctive because they are a ritual enactment of the basic Creation Myth. In his book, The Sacred and th e Profane, Mircea Eliade states, The creation of the world becomes the archetype of every human gesture, what ever its plane of reference may be. Every construction or fabrication has the cosmogon y as paradigmatic model. Techniques of orientation, or aligning oneself to the directions, are des igned for the construction of sacred space. The more closely a ritual reproduces the work of the creator gods, the more effective it is in producing the appropriate results. The model for the creation of sacred space begins from a center and projects horizons in the four cardinal directions: East-West, North-South. This model has bee n followed throughout history when settling new territory or in the founding of cit ies. Any individual resides at the center of his/her own existence. This quadrated circle sets up the conditions necessary for us to enter into the sacred time/space of the archetypes. We may contact the gods through the medium of th e sacred pole or cosmic pillar. The Middle Pillar Exercise is a particularized for m of this sacred connection. Sacred time appears under the paradoxical aspect of circular time, revers ible and recoverable, a sort of mythical eternal present that is periodically rei ntegrated by means of rites."},{"pageNumber":918,"pageContent":"When we enter this psychic region, we experience the feeling of immort ality, since our soul is in a time which is equivalent to the \"beginning.\" The principle char acteristics of sacred space include the following: (a). A break in the homogeneity of space; (b). This break is symbolized by an opening where passage from one cosmic r egion to another is facilitated (i.e. between heaven and earth, earth and the under world); (c). Communication with heaven is expressed by variants of the Cosmic Pil lar, which stands erect at the Center of the World. This Pillar is a useful symbol for the Ego-Self Axis, or the connection bet ween the conscious and subconscious principles of existence. Forming the link betwee n ego-consciousness and the Self, it represents both aspects of the soul working together in har mony. It is known in Magick as the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Banishing and Middle Pillar Exercises conform precisely to the c reation myth. Since a myth is a paradigmatic model, one can easily understand how it can be a very eff ective exercise. It establishes your relationship to the cosmos and your consciou s relationship to totality. Eliade has said: What men do on their own initiative, without a mythical model, belongs to th e sphere of the profane; hence, it is a vain and illusory activity, in the last analysi s, unreal. The more religious a man is, the more paradigmatic models he possesses to guide hi s attitudes and actions. With this in mind, we may examine how the Banishing Ritual produces an ef fective orientation and transformation in the psyche of the aspirant. 1). Construct a circle. In order to \"ground\" our imagery of the surrounding cir cle, it is necessary to have a physical model in the beginning of magickal practice. Hamm er a spike into the dirt. Extend a string from it which is used for a radius, and inscri be a circle in the dirt. If you have no suitable place which is private enough, purchase two 4'x8' m asonite panels and paint a portable model on your floor. Walk around in the circle to get a \"fe el\" for your working area. By placing your body in the circle, you will get a feeling for your special spot, then later this circle is internalized. Visualization will allow you to set up your circle at will, once its lineaments are firmly in mind. In alchemy, this sacred area was created through a process known as circumamb ulatio. It promotes focus or concentration on the center. An indirect approach to th e center was provided through circumambulatio. In setting off the circumference of your magical circle, you enact this primary deed. It prepares the mind for the influx of arche typal energies. The circle is a receptive, feminine symbol. For a brief exercise, dance slow ly into the center, proceeding with a spiral motion. 2). Return to the center of the circle. Imagine a stream of white light flowing into your body from above. This scintillating rod of light penetrating the body, is the mascul ine force of the spirit. It traverses the planes of existence from spirit to matter . It transforms and"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"connects instinct to archetype. The light may be visualized as extending fr om a point above the head, widening into a cone shape which is widest at the feet. 3). Perform the Qabalistic Cross (facing East). This affirms the basic s tructure of The Tree of Life, interpenetrating the physical body, and ordering processes. 1. Touch the forehead, say ATOH (Thou art). 2. Bring the hand down toward the feet, saying MALKUTH. 3. Touching the left shoulder, say VE-GEDULAH. 4. Touching the right shoulder, VE-GEVURAH. 5. Crossing the hands over the breast, say LE-OLAHM. AMEN This is repeated when closing the circle at the end of your rite. 4). Orientation Ritual. There are several extant variations on the theme of the Banishing rite. These include The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, and Lesser Ri tual of the Hexagram, used in the defunct Order of the Golden Dawn, and the active Ordo T empli Orientis (O.T.O.). (20) Another variation is the Setting of the Wards of Power in the Aurum Solis (A..S..). (21) These rituals begin by quadrating the circle. One form (Golden Dawn) p roceeds to the right, turning clockwise E. - S. - W. - N. The other, (Aurum Solis) moves to the left to clear the area, and then to the right to invoke the angels. Since it is traditional that a widdershins movement (leftward or counterclockwise) is a banishing movement, and cl ockwise motion invokes forces, this detail of the A..S.. ritual seems preferred. The quadrated circle symbolizes the wholeness of four elements u nited in the center. This sets up a field with two polarities, synthesized in a central unifyin g principle. Four is the minimum number of divisions of a circle which represents wholenes s. The four (forms), as it were, a frame for the one, accentuated as the centr e...By unfolding into four it acquires distinct characteristics and can therefore be k nown...So long as a thing is in the unconscious it has no recognizable qualities and is conseque ntly merged with the universal unknown, with the unconscious All and Nothing...But as soon as t he unconscious content enters the sphere of consciousness it has already split into t he \"four,\" that is to say it can become an object of experience only by virtue of the four basic funct ions of consciousness. It is perceived as something that exists (sensation); it is recognized as this and distinguished from that (thinking); it is evaluated as pleasant or unp leasant, etc. (feeling); and finally, intuition tells us where it came from and wh ere it is going...The splitting into four has the same significance as the division into the hor izon into four quarters, or the year into four seasons. That is, through the act of becoming cons cious the four basic aspects of a whole judgement are rendered visible. (22)"},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"In alchemy, the center was the quintessence, or spiritual aspect of m atter, which is the basis of the elements. A mandala is a magical circle representing ultimate un ity of inner and outer reality. The magical circle is a tool for experiencing the rationally un knowable. The four principles which the aspirant manifests include: 1. openness, or receptivity; 2. plurality of consciousness, or a condition of multiple possibilities; 3. engagement, where the individual confronts the continuum with \"right action\" or personal intervention; 4. integrability, which indicates a digestible amount of experience of cosmi c consciousness. A unique moment of perfection emerges from the latent continuum. Th e intervention of this ordering principle promotes realization in consciousness of th e underlying unity in creation. The stable, cohesive nature of the boundary of the circle is represente d by its division into 4 parts. 'Four' is the number which represents the soul. 'One' repre sents God, or God- Realization. Giordano Bruno, 16th Century alchemist, defined magic as \"that w hich unites the soul with God through love.\" So, this basic orientation ritual is a graphic representation of the unification of material and spiritual realms through mutual interpenetration. The aspirant is the nexus point of the operation wher e these principles are commingled. Spirit is manifested, and matter ennobled. The soul is protected from disintegrative influence and reconstituted positively, using right act ion and visualization. This timeless world is conducive to synchronistic or parapsychological phe nomena. This doesn't mean miraculous manifestations of desires or ego-control fantas ies. This realm operates on determined patterns of probability. Its proper use is for med itation which leads the personality toward inner concentration and unification. NO MAGIC SHOULD EVER BE PERFORMED OUTSIDE OF A CONSECRATED CIRCLE. Anthropologists have noted that ritual and play cannot be separated in primit ive civilizations. They interpenetrate and overlap one another. Rituals and games are alike in that both require complete sincerity and complete detachment fr om wishes and desires. To avoid the trap of \"cheating\", one has to be passionately involved, but sacrifice any personalistic desire. This reflects a basic religious attitude. Rit uals and games need fixed rules and certain specific images to govern their proper unfolding, bu t they are not completely rigid. A certain amount of playful personal freedom is inhe rent in the unique artistic execution of a rite or game. Do not conduct your ritual mechanistic ally; an error in form is more excusable than a faulty approach or attitude. Try to cultivate an d maintain a joyous, playful orientation. Magick is called the Great Work, because what \"works\" is that which has th e power to transform...not because it is conducted in a spirit of disciplined dru dgery."},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"ORIENTATION RITUAL b. Psychic Equilibration and the Middle Pillar Exer cise To my mind, the exercise described as the Middle Pillar is the groundwork of all ac tual developmental work. It is a process which is the basis of Magic. That this has been but seldom realized is obviously at the root of the futile attempts to do Ceremonial an d perform Ritual, of which the general public hears every now and again. Even studen ts of Magic of many years standing have been guilty of negligence in this respect, an d also in failing to recommend it to their successors. --Israel Regardie/ The Middle Pillar The circuit of the Tree of Life represents All possible experien ces of human existence. The spheres represent modes of being, while paths are transitional phas es between them. The Middle Pillar Exercise circulates the consciousness of the aspir ant around all these aspects. The practice of its visualization begins activating only the spheres of the M iddle Pillar, in line with the vertical axis of the body. Later, when some proficiency has be en acquired, the spheres of the side pillars are added. We then have the entire diagram of the Tree interpenetrating, and ordering all planes from physical to spiritual. T his is a fairly profound image produced with a minimum of graphic elements. Intonation, or vibration, of the God-names makes it easier to drop into the the ta and alpha state which Middle Pillar encourages. They are not sung, but rather droned or chanted so that a tingling resonance can be felt to emanate from the corresponding physi cal center. Experiment with the pitch of your voice to produce a rich, sonorous tone. Put fe eling in it, and add your own dramatic interpretation. You set up a feedback system with yourself, and the more often the sequence from intonation to brain wave pattern is re inforced, the easier it will become for you to create this state. Eventually, the aspirant c ould perform the exercise in the most distracting of situations without loss of concen tration. The goal of Middle Pillar Exercise is the eventual formation of the Philosop her's Stone, or Diamond Body. Many phases of transformation are necessary to work toward this task. One of the operations necessary for the production of the stone is the alche mical circulatio, or circulation of consciousness around the aspects of being. This circulat ion of the light (consciousness) unites diverse centers. This circulation of one's true, creative, formative energies produces a sense of joy and intoxication, as if one had been freshl y bathed. It opens up the reality of an inner world, which serves to break the soul's de pendence on the phenomenal world. Circulation fixes the light. In fact, it builds a body of light, which make s the enlightenment a permanent condition. The light must be visualized as permeating the bod y, not only inside or outside. While the light means clarity, perception and enlight enment of understanding, as you circulate it around your body, there should be a percep tible physical sensation, as well. Once you begin your meditation, there should be no inter ruptions; end and beginning are one. To be effective at all, the confirmation in the light sh ould last for a minimum of 15 minutes. Circulatio, or circulation of the light, combines th e alchemical"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"operations of sublimatio and coagulatio. Sublimation means generally to have an enn obling effect, and coagulation means to solidify. During circulatio, one sublimates body and coagulates spirit. Circulation arou nd the aspects of being leads to an equilibrium where one is contained within the opposites. Spirit penetrates soul, and soul envelops spirit. When spirit and soul unite, th oughts are immobilized. The soul \"crystallizes\" and spirit becomes an effecti ve influence in the personality. This is real-I-zation of the Diamond Body, or Self. The phenomen a which used to be experienced as (external or internal light) is now perceived as p sychic revelation. This balancing is a delicate process. It must be performed by the ri ght person at the right time. Sublimatio consists of spirit and soul ascending and descending f rom lower to higher, and higher to lower, in the imaginal realm. Through it, the spirit hidden in matter becomes visible. Sublimatio is the alchemical form of resurrection. Sublimatio, psychologically, is the process of raising concrete, personal experie nce to a higher level, a level of abstract or universal truth. Coagulatio, in contrast, i s the concretization or personal realization of an archetypal image . (23) Sublimatio is a vertical, solar activity. Coagulatio is feminine, or lunar in quali ty. Excess quantities of either of these potencies may have destructive effec ts. This is the value of a balancing ritual. The solar-libido, which is creative and life-promot ing, may be experienced as scorching dryness or fiery anger. The lunar-libido also has negative forms, wh ich are literal \"bring downs.\" These modes of psychic energy have a wide range of pow erful effects on human experience. Through disciplined use of a balancing ritual, the solar-principle provi des an increase in understanding and an expanded field of awareness. The Stone's lunar portion materializes elusive intuitions and spiritual potential. One submits willingl y to the transpersonal totality of psyche. This marriage produces the Philosopher's Stone through circ ulation. Sublimatio is the vertical, Middle path and corresponds with the eleme nt Air. In QBL, Shekinah is the Middle Pillar. She meditates the ascents and desc ents of the soul and spirit. Through her, the ten spheres of the Tree of Life slowly sublimate into K ether, the Crown (Primordial Air). The \"ascents and descents\" of the soul are characteri zed in ancient lore as Angels. An example of this imagery is the story of Jacob's Ladder. The Supernal Triad (top 3 spheres of the Tree of Life) represents th e three aspects of knowledge: the Crown, Wisdom (the Knower), and Understanding (that wh ich is known). In Kether, the Crown, all opposites reside in total union. It reconcile s oppositions which are distributed throughout the other spheres. One may be redeemed through this self-knowledge. But there is great danger in direct revelation of the archetypal psyche. The danger lies in calling up the pure archetype, which ego-consciousness is never able to assimilate or integrate. Therefore, never invoke Spheres, but always use Pathworking. If one succumbs to the disintegrative effect , the personality is annihilated in the Abyss of the transcendent imagination. This is the ps ychological equivalent of drowning. The alternative is release from the personal e go attitude toward"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"active participation within the archetypal dimension. Behavior does not b ecome archetypal. It already is, if only you care to notice. Dreams, Active Imagination, and the practice of Ceremonial Magick may be seen as forms of coagulatio. In the process of circulatio, there is a resurrection of the Soul of Body. Images are an expedient mode of access to the knowledge of the soul, as it circulates rhythmically throughout every cell of the body. The body becomes subtle and spirit gains body. One is able to maintain daily f unctions in the ordinary world without losing intimate contact with the archetyp al dimension. In fact, this connectedness to daily life is essential to balance soul-travel in t he archetypal realms. Maintain ordinary pursuits except during the allotted meditation period . This indirect penetration to the core-of-being produces fulfillm ent. One may use conscious, purposeful action to intentionally produce experience of unconscious non -action which is purposeless. This is a natural preparation for death, the experience of awar eness without the constraints of time/space. The dynamic activity associated with ego-conscious (the desire to know, to pe netrate and illumine) culminates in a cessation of effort. The rational process of con trolling imagination defers to another power. This experience of silence and tranquility is known as Shekinah, or Sophia, Divine Wisdom. This means there is an emptying of the personal attach ments of the ego. Man then experiences a timeless incarnation of the universal aspe ct of being. The alchemical process described through this circular thinki ng is imaginatio. This indicates an abstraction from concentration and active fantasy. Its negentropi c effects are a product of the Self. \"Free-energy\" enters the field of time when i t leaves the archetypal world. In sublimatio-coagulatio, something new is created, and negentropic potential becomes available. This is commonly described to have a cleansing, or healing eff ect. Through sublimation, the spirit hidden in matter becomes visible. \"P rimitive thinking\" or anima consciousness (a diffuse awareness of potentials), is more sui ted to maintaining opposites in harmony while this ordering process continues along mythical p atterns. It might be thought of as an archetypal ordering process, a \"Way.\" When disorder is not ordered by archetypal processes, it falls to the ego. A middle path between \"primitive thinking\" and directed, goal-ori ented (ego) thought points to the type of sublimation which Jung speaks of in Aion. The ego system has a linear form of segmented, irreversible time implanted as a result of the dire cted thinking and historical development of the self. A relationship between the ego and t he self is possible through the transcendent function. This is not built up with dire cted thinking, but with circular thinking, the negentropic source: imagination. Middle Pillar Exercise provides a fail-safe, balanced form of participat ion in the realm of imagination, which is central to psychology, alchemy, magick, and physics.

The ball is to be about 1 1/2 to 2 ft. in diameter, just above the head. As you visualize, chant \"EH-HE-YEH\" thre e times, quite slowly. If you do it correctly, you resonate within your own body, causing physiological and psychological changes. Next, imagine a rod of light descending through your head to your throat. It changes col ors there and becomes pale lavender. The ball of light is visualized as the same size, only the color changes. Chant \"YE-HOH-VOH E-LOH-HEEM three times. The ball then travels down to the center of the chest. The color changes to gol d. Chant \"YE-HOH-VOH E-LOAH-VA-DA-ATH\", three times, slowly. Once a concurrent visualization of the centers is obtained, and the seque nce of chants finished, the ball travels back up through the body to the head. From the he ad a stream of energy goes down the left arm, left leg, the entire left side of the body, comi ng back to the head via the right side of the body. This energy then travels down the from of your b ody, coming back to the head via the right side of the body. This energy then travels d own the front of your body, through the feet, and comes back up to the head via the spine . At that point, it becomes a fountain, spewing forth multicolored light, after spiral ing up from the feet a third time. When the energy is moving downward, you should exhale; when it is moving back t owards the head, moving upward, you should inhale. When the ball is at your feet, in the b eginning of the exercise, it may be expanded to include the entire sphere of the e arth, as the god- form is literally The Lord of the Earth. The visualized colors, and vibratory nature of the chanted god-names, turn on th e endocrine system. The harmonization of right brain and left brain func tions is symbolized in the harmonious blending of the circulation. Frequent (once daily, minimum) practice of the middle pillar, doing th e visualizations and doing the chants, will create an energy reservoir which balances the pe rsonality, promotes growth, initiates repair or healing, and builds a reserve for times of str ess. It forms the basis of a firm foundation for further experiments in self-transformat ion. Middle Pillar Exercise provides a fail-safe, balanced form of participat ion in the realm of imagination, or the psyche. A practice of this type, whether a psychological exer cise or a magical rite is central to psychology, alchemy, magick, and physics. It forges a consc ious link with our Source, and a road or means of communication for consciousness t o travel along--it is a Way. Through it we come to know and understand our inner guiding principle and work toward realizing our Divinity. Tiphareth represen ts our inner guiding principle, but Kether is our sainthood, or Mastership.

The gulf between"},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"our animalistic nature and our incarnation of Divinity in the Master-sou l is symbolically expressed by the vertical column of Middle Pillar. THE MIDDLE PILLAR EXERCISE may be corresponded with Tiphareth, sin ce it seeks to align us with the higher Self. The establishment of a conscious dialogu e between the ego and the Self is the goal of both Jungian Psychology and High Magick. We can consciou sly work toward this goal. Its psychological aspect deals with establishing an \"e go-Self axis\" or line of communication. Likewise, in Magick the same vertical connection b etween the mundane and transcendent is sought. This seeking is active and a procedur e has been established to realize the goal. The procedure is a visualization exercise w herein we build the Tree of Life within our physical, astral, causal, and divine Selves. Middle Pillar Exercise concerns spheres known as #1 Kether; Daath; #6 T iphareth; #9 Yesod; and #10 Malkuth.(see diagram, next page.) The ancient philosophers wh o developed this system created a symbolic means of depicting how to gain control over you r emotions enough to remain poised in detachment from the dual pull of the opposit es. This develops within you a new faculty for discrimination and spiritual discernment . The mind moves from the superficial to the depths wherein lie creativity and meaning. \" The Secret of Wisdom can be discerned only from the place of balanced power, \"--that is b etween the two outer pillars, along the Middle Pillar where all transformations of consci ousness occur! This is freedom from emotional compulsion, and yields equanimity. This central point between the two symbolic pillars of the opposites, th e place of balanced power from which the working is correctly viewed, is the implication of D AATH, the shadowy Sphere. Doing Middle Pillar, you magically create the sphere DAAT H as an imaginal gateway to mystical experience--another dimension of experience . It is a new factor of adaptation or equilibrium, not a given within the basic scheme. It i s the result of actively seeking, then experiencing, the transpersonal Divine through grac e. It is this new factor of adjustment which is known variously as the Golden Flower, Rosy Cros s, Philosopher's Stone, Diamond Body, etc. and is linked with Tiphareth as t he seat of conscious awareness of the higher Self. To the central spheres and shadowy Daath are attributed five Divine Names of God. They are the Names of God on each of the five planes expressing the vibratory rates of various grades or degrees of consciousness. No religious or metaphysical theory attach es to the employment of these names--they come from the Judeo-Christian system . You can be any religion and employ them without conflict. They are keys which open doors to di fferent parts of our being, the existence of which hitherto we have been kept in ignorance. The words should be committed to memory: 1.

Middle Pillar brings in a charge of spi ritual force, which is realized in consciousness. It brings Godhead into incarnation . THE MIDDLE PILLAR Middle Pillar consists of several phases: First the preliminary est ablishment of rhythmic breathing. Second, the formulation of the five centers through vibrating the God Names. And third, circulation of the Divine force throughout the psychic syste m. After months of practice you can extend the scope of your effort by adding the spheres of the t wo side columns as well. Remember, while vibrating the Divine Name of each sphere to contemplate in full consciousness on the implications of the sphere, i .e. its spiritual qualities and its relation to your own divine consciousness. Also, DAATH, as the link be tween your ego and Sainthood is very important. At Tiphareth, we realize the Self and can take up an I-Thou dialogue with it. Yet, we don't merge with the Self, or God, or becom e perfected until Kether, when the final traces of duality are annihilated--there fore the ego is annihilated or transcended. You become a timeless incarnation of the unive rsal aspect of Being. METHOD: Stand upright, hands to side, eyes closed, breathing rhythmicall y and deeply. Wait until the mind is calm, quiet, and still. Transfer your attention to the region immediately above the crown of your head, and visualize a great sphere of brilli ant white radiant Light. When the visualization is obtained, regard it with a sense of devot ion since it is the vital core of your Being, the living spark of Divinity. It is pure Light an d power. Vibrate three of four times EHEIEH (Eh-hay-yeh), which means \"I AM\" or \" I WILL BE.\" Steadfast in the contemplation of this Divine Source of power and enlig htenment, endeavor to feel an all-penetrant beam of brilliance which is travelling downward toward your throat or nape of neck. Light becomes a lavender-blue sphere as you vibrate Ye-h oh-voh Eh-loh-heem, repeatedly. A quite indescribable sense of poise and men tal quiescence should be experienced. The brilliant beam then descends to the heart or region of solar plexus, and from there a warmth and a quite different sense of powerful love will gently radiate from within like an interior sun. Vibrate the Name, Ye-hoh-voh El-oah ve-Da-ath, several times . It is felt within the interior of the body, at its very heart. As you pass from contemplation of th e heart to the generative organs, they will become stimulated or \"turned on.\" Visual ize the bright violet sphere and vibrate Shah-dai El-Chai. After arousing this center, t he beam of Light passes downwards to the feet; this negative pole of Middle Pillar automatic ally appeared when Kether was formulated, but now we concentrate here on the olive dr ab or jet black sphere, and vibrate Ah-doh-nai ha-Ah-retz. We have brought down light into t he personality, even the body."},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"Now circulation of the Light becomes necessary. Having been awakened from l atency into some degree of activity, it is necessary that the power the centers gene rate should be circulated throughout the invisible or psychic system, or nervous disorde rs and psychic disturbance could result.

With everyone of the five centers active and throwing power i nto the mind and body, and clear awareness of middle pillar, another technique bec omes necessary. RETURN TO CONTEMPLATION OF KETHER. Imagining this cent er still radiating, will it to circulate through your system. It descends from the he ad towards the left shoulder. Passing through the entire length of the left side of t he body, the magnetic current strikes the soul of the left foot. Then it passes over the right sole, upwards through the leg and thigh and body to the right shoulder, eventually returning to Kethe r. Second, This time imagine the current of spiritual power descending from Kether in a forward direction, downward in front of the face, neck, chest, thighs and feet. It turns backward along the soles, calves, ascends the spinal column, and neck until it reaches Kether. Repeat both steps several times, breathing rhythmically. To \"wrap u p\" the circulation phase of the exercise, we imagine spiralling Light surroun ds our body. Contemplate on Kether and imagine the upright column of brilliance, corre sponding to Middle Pillar; Pass now to the visualization of Malkuth emanating its inh erent power of stability and equilibrium and fertility. Spiral Light up from the soul of your feet, as if wrapping yourself like a mummy. The spirals of Light gradually ascend the b ody, while you feel a distinct sensation of a whirling of spiritual powers rising from feet to thighs, up the trunk, swathing you in pure white Light, until, the current rests in Kether, where it shoots out the crown of the head in a fountain effect. This prepares you by stilling the mind for meditation.

Middle Pillar is an exercise in visualization. Visualization is import ant as a means of communication with the subconscious, to influence the proces s of self- transformation. (b). Reproduced scientific evidence, (Marks, 1975), now indicates that th ere is a mutual-reinforcement between certain specific vibrated vowel-s ounds and visualization experiences. This constitutes a visual-auditory synesthes ia or feedback system. Vowels evoke powerful visual \"sensations.\" (c). The purpose of this paper is to show how Middle Pillar Exercise co rresponds with several forms of self-induced synesthesia, or sensory blending. A reason is shown for retraining our eyes and ears out of habitual modes of sensory screenin g."},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"With this tool, we might free ourselves from certain conceptual restrai nts and upgrade our practice of Middle Pillar Exercise. This is a technique wh ich heals our culturally pre-programmed Cartesian duality, the mind-body split. II. Historical Background: Synesthesia is defined as sensory blending or melding; any combination of t he five senses may be involved simultaneously. The most common combinations are between vi sual- images and sound (colored-hearing), and visual-images produced by taste. The sense of smell, in perfumes, for example, evokes memory and its attendant images. Al pha-numeric color synesthesia may have led to specific color attributions to the Hewbr ew letters (even though these attributions vary widely). In synesthesia, ordinary stimuli elicit extraordinary conscious experie nces. For example, standard black digits may elicit highly specific color experiences and sp ecific tastes may elicit unusual tactile sensations. Imagine that every time you hear a partic ular sound or view an ordinary black digit, you experience an accompanying perception of a highl y specific color. The stimulus and elicited experience can occur in th e same modality--printed digits or letters can trigger colors called photisms. Or, conversely, cr oss modal translation leads to taste eliciting tactile experience, or sounds eliciting colors . Experiments show that for any given synesthete there is high consistenc y of the pairing between eliciting stimuli and the synesthetic experiences over ti me. We can take advantage of this tendency in our magickal practice, and train ourselves toward these automatic sensory associations. For example, we can learn to associated, not only the color, but the musical notes of each of the alpha-numer letter/paths of the Tree of Life . Synesthetes often claim that their synesthetic experiences occur independent of their intentions, suggesting the processes underlying the phenomenon may be automatic. Findings show (Smilek, Dixon, 2002) that non-synesthetics can be trained to as sociate color labels with uncolored forms, so we can presume other associations can like wise be trained. A cortical pathway in the ventral aspect of the Temporal Lobe is suspected in activation of synesthesia. But there is no \"seat of synesthesia\" in the brain; the vis ual cortex is also entrained with photisms. Often inner experience is projected exte rnally onto the stimulus. The binding of form and synesthetic color can be extended throughout th e qabalistic correspondence system. Research shows that synesthetic color may be activated outside of awarene ss, or conscious intent. It is precisely this type of coupling we are trying to achieve. There are also conceptually driven synesthetic experiences, without externally pres ented stimuli. This implies even in purely astral magical work, the automaticness we ingrain t hrough the correspondences should meld classical qabalistic associations together to create a gestalt or the atmosphere of our ritual. In early training, an externally introduced sti muli may be necessary -- this is the purpose of the magickal armamentum of weaponry and appurtences. They help elicit the associated synesthetic experien ces. There is a common core of similarities in synesthetic experiences. V isual colors are associated with speech sounds."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"There is evidence that everyone is capable of experiencing synesthesia. Syn esthesia may occur spontaneously, or as a learned response. Middle Pillar Exercise, with its simultaneous 'vibration of God-names' and visualizations, may be viewed as an 'acc ess code.' This 'access code' is a helpful tool which opens creative relat ionships with different parts of the subconscious and the physical body (parasympathetic system ). When we are \"caught up\" in the meditative process, we experience cogniti ve meaning in sensory form. Psi information (24) is mediated via mental imagery. The image and its \"meaning\" are identical. Therefore, psi communications are enhanced und er conditions which facilitate imagery. Both Magickal visualizations and creative imagination promote this viewpoint. According to Archetypal Psychology, synesthesia is how imagination imagines. What t his experience does is transform the singleness of any one sense out of its lit eralness. It makes a metaphor of sense perception itself, for example, \"I can see music.\" One of synesthesia's special roles is to summarize important cognitive d istinctions in a convenient and economical way. As a shorthand, it is compact but relatively fixed and, therefore, limited. Its validity as a useful tool appears to be limited to th e context of magickal practice. Without a system for creating a meaningful experience, suc h as pathworking, there is very little spiritual value in the phenomenon excep t the aesthetic. Researchers have considered synesthesia less significant in adulthood than childhood. This need not be true with proper application, such as the Middle Pillar Exe rcise. III. Traditional Technique: Proper control of the breath has been emphasized in both western and e astern meditation techniques. This, of course, connects with the sense of smell, and posi ts us in the realm of Psyche (the breath-soul of the head whose passages are the nostrils). Psyche's realm is \"the place between\", the realm of soul-making. It is that place between the physical body and the abstractions of the spirit. Note the semantic similarity between ' psi' and 'Psyche.' In QBL, this internal space is called Tiphareth, realm of imagination. Middle Pillar is designed so that the actual formation of the body/mind sys tem may be changed and renewed. It is not concerned with the exclusive cultivation of either the body or consciousness. Regardie states: \"Always in a salutary way is the path between the two extrem es indicated.\" The vibration of god-names, as well as stimulating the vision in specific directions, stimulates the endocrine system and glands in the mid-brain by a resonan ce effect. These effects are not necessarily to be viewed as causal (the result of previou s action), but are perceived simultaneously; their reciprocal relationship is inhe rent. IV. New Model:"},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"We may presume to use current scientific research to upgrade our prac tice of Middle Pillar. Through the inherent mutual reinforcement phenomena of visual -auditory systems, when we Middle Pillar, we induce synesthesia at will. The next obvious question is: why would we want to induce synesthesia? Wh en one is experiencing the creative imagination, that engagement with an image, all mod es of perception meld into indivisible unity. This form of systematic cr oss modal matching is closely allied with the concept of a system of correspondences. Significance is not found in analysis, but in the image itself. (25) The i mage consists of such apparently diverse elements as behavior, fantasy, thoughts, dreams, illness, et c. None of these are 'because of' the image, they are the image itself as a 'just-so' s tory. To form a \"ground\" for our spirituality in the imaginal realm (internal topography) we m ust re- imagine the Creation. Re-imagining the Creation is precisely the function of Middle Pillar; it is a dramatization of the Creation Myth. In his book, The Sacred and the Profane, Eliade states, \"Th e creation of the world becomes the archetype of every human gesture, whatever its pl ane of reference may be...communication with heaven is expressed by variants of the cosmic p illar, which stands at the center of the world.\" This pillar is a useful symbol for what we shall term the ego-Self axis. T his axis is a relationship built up through various psychological exercises. It forms th e link between ego-consciousness and one's Holy Guardian Angel. The H..G..A.. represents both conscious and subconscious minds working toget her in harmony. In psychology this is termed the Transcendent Function. It est ablishes one's relationship to the cosmos, namely a conscious relationship to outer/inner space. As in synesthesia, we are returned to the magickal, child-like mode where co gnitive meaning is in sensory form. In this experience, careful aesthetic elaboration of a psych ic event is its meaning. One can learn to experience this mode of consciousness in a ritual situa tion. Once (re- )learned, it can extend into every sensory experience of daily life, either literal or metaphorical. The sense of inherent meaningful importance in day-to-day events and tri via is a necessary concern of soul. Through it 'life makes sense', and 'sense makes life' . The alchemists always stressed identity of the physical/spiritual connection. The roots for the word 'sense' mean something which is directly tangib le (physical and solid or concrete). It also now implies something meaningful and significan t. Imagination takes place wherever we are. When you split sensory data from meaning, you not only sp lit sensation from intuition, you also split spirit, soul, and body. The conjunction of concrete sensation, psychic image, and spiritual meanin g is aisthesis, which denotes breathing in (smelling) and perceiving. In ritual, all th e senses are directly involved via the correspondence system. This creates a mood or atmosphere wh ich the"},{"pageNumber":931,"pageContent":"participant \"breathes in.\" There is an experience of unity of the sens es via synesthetic metaphor. V. Techniques: The guidelines for inducing visual-auditory synesthesia are fairly straigh tforward: 1. Vowels are an especially powerful source for production of secondary visual sensations. 2. There is a correlation between auditory pitch and visual brightness; b rightness of vowels vary and photisms (visual images of light) produced vary in brightness as t he sounds that produce them vary in their frequency. 3. Visual pitch predicts the whiteness or blackness of associated phot isms. 4. Visual size increases as auditory pitch decreases; the louder the vowe l-sound, the larger the image. However, induced size is not related solely to pitch. Vowel-Sounds and Color Correspondences Pronunciation Vowel Color Properties Frequency \"mama\" a red & yellow bright \"late, let\" e white \"acute\" high pitch \"bit, beet\" i white \"acute lowest pitch \"home\" o red & black \"grave\" darkest lowest \"boot\" u dark colors, deep blue \"darkest\" darkest lowest ou dark"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"Order of increasing frequency (pitches): u, o, a, e, i. Order if increasing vowel brightness: u, ou, o, a, e, i. Example: The God-name, IAO, begins with a bright vowel and concludes with a dark vowel. The center vowel may be considered the melding point or median. VI. Conclusion: The above information indicates that one might be able to learn to pitch the m agickal voice and loudness to induce a desired visual effect. This eliminates any sens e of detachment from one's experience or activity. This is an experience of the immortal body, or philosopher's stone.

Mankind developed countless culturally-biased \"world pictur es\" to provide an explanation of nature and our pla ce in it. They were formulated in religious and philosoph ical language, and were therefore theological or metaphysical in nature. The art of creating such world pictures probably ha s its roots in protohistorical shamanism. Shamans w ere healers, seers, and visionaries who had mastered de ath. This practice is more than 15,000 years old, a nd continues in some primal cultures. They were techni cians of the sacred and masters of ecstasy. One of their primary ecstatic rituals was the practice of \"shama nic flight,\" to unearthly realms. In these flights, the spirit was entranced. The shaman defined the culture's rel ationship to the cosmos. These flights were \"journeys to Other Worlds,\"out-of -body experiences produced by induction of trance states which gave participants the sensations of fl ying up from the earth and into the cosmos. This ra pture was induced by the soul leaving the body, transcend ing into the realm of spirits and gods. Since they were familiar with both cosmic and physical geography, t hese were more than flights of fancy, for they cont ained a fundamental element of intuition and valid informat ion about the nature of reality. The direction that the psyche takes is oriented tow ard the cosmos, the ground of being that is the uni verse, and the life field is therefore amplified to includ e all dimensions of \"Unconcealed Being.\" The passag eway to greater life is opened and traversable. The central symbol of shamanism is the Sacred Tree, or World Tree, the axis of the world, the center of life. The mortal and finite dimension was transcended by climbing the sacred tree, considered the path to re birth through directing the spirit heavenward. The vehicl e of ascension to the sky realm of the sun, to the territory of illumination, is the drum, whose pulse can induc e initiatory trance states through resonance effect s. The shaman's spirit ascends beyond the plane of dea th, soaring to a timeless place. The soul is transf ormed into a magical bird and the soul ascends into the s ky realm of the spiritual sun, the light of awakene d consciousness unfettered by gravity, the boundaries of space, materiality, and time. Some shamns find themselves \"being nurtured in nests high in the Worl d Tree.\" The higher the nest, the more powerful the shaman will be, the more he will know, the further he will see. Thus, we came to think of reality not in terms of t hings, but as a ladder of process, a great movement and exchange of energies. A teaching then is a copy of this cosmic process on the scale of human time on e arth. Initiation into such a teaching in our own lives me ans that one's own life becomes yet another copy of this process--a microcosm. Spiritual teaching is indirect in that is neither c ompels nor seduces us into belief. Rather, it provi des certain kinds of experiences, which can only be assimilated by the whole of ourselves, by exposing ourselves t o the full range of events which take place in a cosmos. Thus, we are rooted in holism, in the macrocosm. The Uni verse, itself, is a great teaching. At the dawn of culture, the world was conceived in terms of the activity of vibrant spirits. In the Ag e of Mythology, the cosmos was governed by gods and godd essess who dwelt in another dimension. The ancient Greeks were the first to refer to the world as a co smos, an ordered system in contrast to a disordered , random chaos. They posed the age-old question \"What is the origin and structure of the universe.\" This insight that the world was orderly was a quant um leap in the history of thought and philosophy, a nd essential to the development of modern physical sci ence. It took insight to realize that nature is ord erly, even though we take it for granted. All this is a far cr y from the literal scientific picture, which is a s ort of \"cosmic box.\" All theories which describe world process and purpo se, that argue from the existence of the world, or certain facts about the world, to Divinity as the best expl anation for these facts are called cosmological arg uments."},{"pageNumber":935,"pageContent":"They begin with the basic premise that there are ce rtain facts about the world we must explain. The arguments (whether they are causal, design or moral ) are inductive since they begin with alleged facts about the world known through sense experience. This is t he realm of the philosophy of religion. The spheres which encompass the earth in the cosmol ogical schemes of antiquity enmesh us in a network of purposes, a ladder of hierarchies and intentions. T o the ancient mind, the very meaning of this organi zation and order was that the cosmos is an organism, in th e sense of a hierarchy of purposeful engines. The s ecret of the universe is that it's alive! It is embryogenesi s of the Cosmic Egg. This is certainly in the spiri t of the qabalistic model. \"In the Hermetic writings the hierarchical structure of the cosmos resembles that of an organism...(governed by a supreme consciousness or intelligence). At each leve l of being there are \"gods\" or \"angels\" or, to use less uncomfortable language, \"purposeful energies.\" From this point of view, the ancient spatial desc riptions of the cosmos are meant to be understood symbolically. \"Likewise, the word \"sphere,\" used in describing forces and purposes at differe nt levels, is never meant to be taken literally. The very idea of the circular ity of movement in \"the heavens\" can be understood to mean not only the encompassing nature of these progressively higher influences, but their eternal nature. The circle is, among other things, a symbol of that which \"eternally recurs,\" that which i s not subject to time and change as we know them. \"Obviously, there is a great difference between contemplating a univers e which exceeds me in size alone or in intricacy alone, and one which exceeds me in depth of purpose and intelligence. A universe of merely unimaginable size excludes man and crushes him. But a universe that is a manifestation of great consciousnes s and order places man, and therefore calls to him. So much is obvious, for a conscious universe iss the only reality that can include human consciousness. And only when I am completely included by somethin g does the need arise for me to undertand my relationship to it in all the aspects of my inner and outeer life. Only a conscious universe is relevant to the whole of human l ife.\" ( Needleman, 1975 ) Ancient cosmologies were symbolically geocentric, e ven though many cultures calculated that the earth was round and knew the heliocentric nature of planetary motion. Those philosophies were spiritually helioc entric, but this knowledge was a deep initiation, a sacred idea about our experiential place in a hierarchical ly structured conscious universe. They also knew that the senses were subject to illusion. It is geocentr ism, without the idea of microcosmic man, which modern s cience has rejected. But many fail to realize that a purely external geocentrism never existed in the an cient world. \"It is only we, who have the lost the idea of the microcosm, who see it that way ; and, seen that way, geocentrism surely becomes an idiocy, or--at best--a convenie nce for calculation. But taken with the idea of a microcosm, geocentrism reminds man that objective reality contains many kinds of influences that can act upon us, th at there is a scale of being to which man is born would he but search for it diligently, as he pu rsues the satisfactions of external life. It is we who imagine that geocentrism was merely a balm for the ego and a primitive astronomical theory. Because we, have lost the idea of microcosmic man, separate scientific from existential ideas, we imagine t hat this separation is what ancient man was grappling for when on the contrary it was prec isely what he was struggling against.\" (Needleman, 1975)."},{"pageNumber":936,"pageContent":" \"Worlds Without End\" PATH 32 In The Roots of Consciousness , Jeffrey Mishlove describes three basic illusions as being Space, Time, and the Personal Consciousness. In Lawrence Le Shan's The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist, four ways of perceiving reality in the clarivoyant state as it d iffers from ordinary consciousness are described. Sri Auribindo says, \"Trance is a way of escape. The body is made quiet. The physical mind is in a state of torpor. The inner Consciousness is left free to go with its experiences.\" His comments about trance are far from complete. The disadvantage is that trance may becom e indispensible and the problem of the waking consciousness is not solved, except perhaps in hypn otherapy and shamanic healing. Le Shan's four ways of perceiving reality are more complete. 1). In the clairvoyant state, the unity of things is generally felt rather than th e individual aspect. There is a holistic overview of what is happening, rather than an analytical view. 2). Time is experienced as non-linear, (as if the past, present, and futu re were one), rather than as a durational, linear sequence of events. 3). Value judgements, concerning the goodness or badness of any event are general ly not considered in the clairvoyant state. Things are seen only as they are--just so. 4). Information is not gained by seeing, but by knowing, as one's unity with all things. This clear seeing perception is expressed through the metaphor of visual experience. It is a deliteralization of sensory awareness which allows th is inner sight to occur. Le Shan maintains that whether we travel without or journey within, whether we go as a physicist or a mystic, the same unity of experience is seen. Throu ghout history the single pattern persists with all metaphysical teachings: there is something beyond s pace, time, and the good/evil polarities. \"Right thought is to meditate on His names and attributes and wrong thin king is an attempt to know His essence. This idea is further illustrated by gazing on the sun, which is beyond the power of sight; but one may form an idea of it, in seeing its reflection in water, which diminishes the intensity of its light. In the same manner, the"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"universe is a mirror of Absolute Being in which unity appears in diversit y, as by counting one becomes many. One who attempts to know Him through the univers e, the same becomes the book of the most high truth, in which consonants are substan ces and vowels are accidents. The first or opening lines (emanation) is the univer sal reason; the second is the Universal Soul; the third, the highest heaven; the fou rth 'the throne'; then the seven heavenly spheres; next the three kingdoms of nature; and l ast is man. He is the soul or kernel of the world.\" (Archer, The Sufi Mystery). \"326.02 All that is physical is energetic. All that is metaphysical is syne rgetic. . . . 537.46 What is important about the individual and important about the Universe is that neither is exempt from any of the rules. Universe is the sum-total, an d the individual is the special case. Universe is the aggregate of all the generalized principles. E ach individual is one of the illions of ways the game of Universe could be played.\" ( Fuller, 1976). The Isotropic Universe: Location and the Cosmic Cen ter Modern cosmology is skeptical that any location suc h as cosmic center exists. The location principle a ssumes it is unlikely that the Earth, Sun, and Galaxy are priviledged places, simply because we are here. But symbolic reality still affirms for us that the cent er of our universe is wherever we create a sense of sacred space. This deduction of sacred psychology is not w rong, it simply is not literal, but metaphorical re ality. The cosmological principle (deduced from the unifor mity of the cosmic background radation) asserts tha t all places in the universe are alike. In a state of iso tropy things are the same in all directions. This m ay not seem to be true as we look out from the Earth to the hea vens, but it has been proven on the most macroscopi c of levels to hold true. From observations we have esta blished that the universe is isotropic around us. Beyond about 300 million light years, the universe begins to look isotropic, as Lucretius predicted in 55 B.C. If the universe is the same in all places, it has n o center. As we continue projects to map the univer se, we are finding out about the relative distribution of matt er in the universe. The observed state is isotropy; the deduction is homogeneity. Fuller modeled this isotropic state in the omnitria ngulated Isotropic Vector Matrix. Every vertex of t his synergetic system is an energy center. This matrix is metaphysical rather than physical so it is not a n observable field. A field is a quantity defined at each point throughout some region of space and time , such as an electromagnetic field. A scalar field is virtual , since it has only magnitude at each point. A vect or field has both magnitude and direction. When we say that the figure (mankind) can not be stu died independently of the ground, (Universe), this is the fundamental symbolic representation of that isotrop ic groundstate. The threshold of matter, the edge o f science, the groundstate of mysticism. Understandin g this pre-geometric nature of the metaphysical foundations of reality confirms that \"We are That.\" The most recent attempt to map the Universe (SciAme r, Ju1999, p38-45) show that galaxies tend to clump together into larger and larger groups. These immen se intricate structures are the results of the forc es of early inflation or expansion of the universe, and s ubsequent gravitational interaction. But clumpiness is paradoxical to the cosmological principle that the universe is isotropic and therefore homogeneous. How do we reconcile the ultimate evenness of matter with the unevenness of our immediate observations? Isotropy is only true in a subtle, statistical sens e. What we oberve are superclusters and abysmal void s, density flucutuations. Yet in cross-section of a ma ny as 3 million galaxies, the sky looks roughly the same in all directions. We are discovering even the voids co ntain intergalactic \"dark matter,\" and intergalacti c space is populated by a full 1/3 of all stars, existing a s singlets outside of galaxies. Up to 100 million light years, galaxies are distrib uted as fractals. Fractal distribution cannot be is otropic nor homogeneous. But on scales of hundreds of millions of light years, the fractal nature yields to a nois e process. Still broader observations show the return of clust ering or bunching in walls and voids. But in harmon ic analysis, the mathematical distribution of galaxies and random noise is identical. \"Harmonic analysis can reconcile the cosmological principle with the clus tering of matter. If the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, observers sitting on pl anets in"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"separate galxies should measure the same properties for the universe on its largest scales. Of course, the will se different glaxy distribution...But given enoug h surveys, or a survey of sufficient size, the two observers should measure the same statistical fluctuations.\" Modern science has a different mode and means of ha rmonic analysis than the Pythagoreans, hose harmoni es were those of the \"music of the spheres.\" But it is still aesthetically pleasing. \"[Harmonic analysis] is based on analyzing the harmonic components of random distributions, and the sound is more like the gush of a waterfall han that of divi ne instruments. Although this modern endeavor may seem neither as pleasi ng nor as spiritual, as those of the past, the concept of an isotropic universe wedded with an understanding of random fields now allows us once again to hear the music of th e spheres.\" (Landy, SciAmer,June1999). Astronomer, Roberto Mendez (Discover, Feb99, p82-87 ) has discovered intergalactic stars and even plane ts in the dark voids of galaxy clusters. He conjectures t hat these vast numbers of intracluster stars come f rom the near misses of galactic interaction. Sprays of star s are shed as galaxies pass by one another. Some of these stars may actually be the ancestors of the galaxies near them, from a far earlier generation of stars. These dim stars could be primordial. The observable space around these isolated stars appears different from our illuminated canopy. \"It is only slightly more imaginative to suppose that some of those planets m ight be inhabited. What might the inhabitants see when they loop up at night? Maybe a f ew sister planets, a few fuzzy galaxies, a star or two--but otherwise their sky wou ld be utterly black. All the other stars would be too far away for the naked eye to see. To those intracluster creatures in Virgo, the universe would seem an empty place. They might even think it revolved entirely around them.\" (Kunzig, Feb99). REFERENCES: Capra, Fritjof & Steindl-Rast, David, Belonging to the Universe, Harper San Francisco, 1991.

As it is ruled ast rologically by the planet Saturn, it has to do with space/time and the propagation of recurre nt patterns, (from archetypal manifestations to habits).

Path 32 is the first path encountered when the aspirant is initiated in to the Way of Return up the Tree of Life. It is a path of equilibrium, since it is found on the Middle Pillar. It represents both the beginning and perfection of the Great Work. 1. Physical Plane: This path, the Universe is the subject of all speculat ive cosmologies, scientific and metaphysical.

Astral Plane: The strongest image for this path is a descent into the un derworld. It is the beginning stage of mystical soul travel, during which one concen trates on development of the astral body. This facilitates the experiencing of reali ty through psychic senses, which are metaphorical perceptions through agencies of sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing. These so-called ESP phenomenon do not require th e introduction of a new sense, but only this new metaphorical mode of appr ehending through those with which we are familiar. This plane of Path 32 also represen ts the beginnings of devotional mysticism. Also included is the concept of karm a, and the mating instinct. The combination of these two leads to the concept of the s oul-mate, who cannot be found until this plane is experienced. Clairvoyance. 3. Causal Plane: The stability conferred by Saturn through this path helps promote concentration, particularly in relationship to images. These images arise spontaneously in the Astral Plane, and percolate through to normal ego- consciousness through this Path, with varying amounts of distortion. Focused concentration eliminates fuzziness. Both magick and psychoanalysis provid e the means for focusing and following images through their transformations i nto an equilibrated state in Tiphareth (#6). Insight. 4. Archetypal Plane: Space/time creates certain limitations or bound ary conditions of both human physical and psychic existence. Acceptance of these condit ions and the form it produces are necessary for realization. With persistence, it is possible to attain perfection through rejuvenation. There is harmony among the Chakras of t he physical body (CNS and endocrines). This produces a cosmic consciousne ss and a yearning for further experiences of soul travel on the path to God-Realizat ion. Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is relevant.

The body is made quiet. The physical mind is in a state of topor. The inner Consciousness is left free to go with its experiences. -- Sri Aurabindo The future is my present thought manifested. --Student Comment, 1976 In Roots of Consciousness , Jeffrey Mishlove describes three basic illusions as being Space, Time, and the Personal Consciousness. In Lawrence Le Shan's The Medium, The Mystic, and the Physicist , four ways of perceiving reality in the clairvoyant state as it differs from ordinary consciousness are described. Sri Aurobindo's comment on th e advantages and disadvantages of any trance state remains imperfect. The disadvantage is that trance becomes indispensable and the problem of the waking consciousness i s not solved. Le Shan's four ways of perceiving reality are very important aspects to key ont o. The first is that when in a clairvoyant state (related to extrasensory perce ption), the unity of things is generally felt rather than the individual aspect. In other w ords, in a clairvoyant state there is a holistic overview of what is happening rather than an analytical view. The second aspect is that Time is experienced as if the past, present , and future were one; rather than a durational, linear sequence of events. The third aspect is that value judgments, concerning the goodness or evilne ss of any event, are generally not considered when in a clairvoyant state. Things are seen only as t hey are. The fourth, and final aspect, is that information is gained not by seeing, but by knowing, as one's unity with all things. This clear seeing perception is expresse d through the metaphor of visual experience. It is a deliteralization of sensory awareness which allows this inner sight to occur. Le Shan maintains that whether one travels without or journeys within, whe ther one goes as a physicist or a mystic, the same unity of experience is seen. Throughout hi story the single pattern persists with all metaphysical teachings: there is so mething beyond space, time and the good/evil realities. As an illustration to ponder, consider a rural railroad that runs through a ser ies of deserted towns in a remote part of the United States. Within each town is a s olitary hermit. Each hermit sees this train arriving and leaving, periodically, and watches goods pile up and disappear at the railroad station. One hermit, in particular, associated the arrival or departure of goods with t he train's coming and going. This hermit had never had any kind of contact with anyone or anyt hing, except that in his particular universe he has a train arriving and leaving; and s omehow goods of all sorts appear at the railroad station; these goods sometimes appear and disappear but are somehow associated with the train's arrival and departur e."},{"pageNumber":943,"pageContent":"Finally, after a period of time, he decides to explore the station. He finds t he schedule of events (arrival and departure times), and he then establishes a rapport wi th his own universe; he is watching this train's predictable movements. He fin ds this to be a way he can communicate with the external world. He finds these packages contain food or instruments which he can use in his world to make himself more com fortable. Compared with the hermits in the other deserted towns, he has complete co mmand of his world. Then, the hermits in the other towns somehow learn of his good fortune. At t hat point, they make a value judgment as to whether this man is evil, or a really good man. Because he seems to have a rapport with his environment, he has learned to make himse lf more comfortable. In this analogy, the conscious mind is the hermit. The railroad station repre sents the preconscious: everything that is \"not me.\" Now, the universe is divided in to two sections: 1. Everything that is the conscious mind, the \"me,\" the hermit. 2. The precons cious (or Collective Unconscious), or everything that is \"not me\", but is in some way dir ectly related to the ego-consciousness. This is the great treasure trove of the subconsci ous. The power of consciousness impresses our Will on the preconscious and fertilizes it so that it will produce the situation which is willed. In other words, each individual is the hermit. Each of us is in the wil derness which is called reality, or the physical plane, closed off from the rest of creation. Eventual ly, certain patterns in this \"reality\" are noticed. Ultimately, things can, and will b e, perceived through the subdivisions \"me\" and \"not me.\" Eventually, it is found that this se paration is one of the three basic illusions of Reality, Personal Consciousness. As the arc hetypal dimensions of experience open, one gains access to realms which transcend time/spac e and personality. The hermit is ready to board the train in an exploration whose goal is unknown and indescribable, from his perspective. For example, using time as a subjective illustration of an illusion, let us consider extrasensory perception in its relationship to time. This is just one exam ple to provide a framework to take this concept into a proper context. In parapsychology there are two categories labeled as either extrasensory perc eption, or psychokinetic phenomena. Psychokinetic phenomena is the term applied to such anomalous occurrences as: 1. Levitation 2. Teleportation 3. Materialization 4. Aportation This orientation will not deal with these phenomenon, but is devote d to extrasensory perception. In research, ESP is divided into five basic categories: 1. Clairvoyance"},{"pageNumber":944,"pageContent":"2. Telepathy 3. Precognition/Retrocognition 4. Radiaesthesia 5. Astral Projection In essence, the five categories listed above are various modes of perceivin g information. It depends on one's own particular coordinate system of time how any physical occ urrence is perceived. N.A.S.A.'s Apollo 14 Mission studies included an experiment in extrasens ory perception. Edgar Mitchell proposed the test to N.A.S.A. The resulting data is quite i nteresting and revolutionized scientific opinion concerning this type of phenomena. Basically, the experiments went as follows: Edgar Mitchell was in spac e, specifically on the moon. The famous medium, Olaf Johnson, was on earth. Though equipped with radi o communications via satellite, Edgar Mitchell and Olaf Johnson has a large exp anse of space between them. With such a large distance to work with, the time variable was m ore easily measured. Light travels at a certain speed. Sound also travels at a certain speed ; depending upon the substances it is going through, time sequences vary. These can be m athematically correlated. Olaf Johnson - on earth - would do some transmission experimen ts with geometrical ESP cards. An extremely sensitive clock measured when s ignals were received. Edgar Mitchell would \"guess\" which cards Olaf Johnson was concentratin g on. They worked on probability curves, calculating how accurate the guesses were , and then related all this to the transmission time lag - the time it took the radio signal to reach earth from the moon. The same technique was used when Olaf Johnson moved on the face of the ear th to see if extrasensory perception deteriorated with increased distances. The same technique was used again when Olaf Johnson was on the opposite side of earth, with the planetary mass between himself and Edgar Mitchell, using th e earth's rotation upon its axis to time this alternate experiment. The results of these tests were outstanding! These tests proved: (1) ESP was independent of time. After the calculations of the time lag b etween earth and the moon, Edgar Mitchell's \"guesses\" occurred at the same instant tha t Olaf Johnson was concentrating on the particular card. INSERT PICTURE (2) ESP was independent of distance, even though Olaf Johnson's physi cal position moved further away. INSERT PICTURE (3) ESP was independent of mass, even though the earth was between the two m en. INSERT PICTURE"},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"Therefore, a new law is being dealt with: a new law which does not follo w the 1/R(2) law, but somehow or another works on a totally different principle, a principle m an has never had to understand before. Using this concept in relation to clairvoyance, it is seen that clairvoyance can b e defined as follows: \"My physical body is located in a given space. I am located in a given space. I received information about an event or a situation from another location, yet I am s till, and have always been located in this same physical space all along. That information was brought to me from some other location. I can visualize it (clairvoyance), hear it (clairaudience), feel it (clairsention), etc. But clairvoyance is the m ode examined here. Any time information is brought from one location to this location, where the i ndividual is physically standing at the present, it is catalogued as clairvoyance. Telepathy i s exactly the opposite. This is where information originates in this location and then i s moved to another locality. In clairvoyance, information is received. In telepathy, information i s transmitted elsewhere. The difference between clairvoyance and telepathy then is strictly the direction of the information flow. The difference between clairvoyance and precognition/retrocognition i s time. In other words, it is the perception of the time element which is there. Agai n, the information received is in a clairvoyant, clairaudient, or clairsentient form, but somehow the time element is mixed up. It is either seen as the future, or the past, rath er than the present. That is the distinctional difference. The information is still the s ame, but the mode of information perception makes a difference. The way clairvoyance relates to radiaesthesia is even more interesting. Radiae sthesia could be defined as using external objects to communicate information to the consciousness. Examples of external objects would include pendulums, tarot cards, tea le aves; anything that is of the \"not me.\" The difference between clairvoyance and astral projection lies only in lo calities. In astral projection, the physical body remains in the same physical space, yet the cons ciousness leaves the body and travels to where the information is; whereas, the clairvoyan t receives the information from somewhere else. In other words, in a clairvoyant state , information is gathered and comes to the physical body; in astral projection, the consciou sness leaves the physical body and travels to where the information is gathered, while the ph ysical body remains immobile. Since the Apollo 14 studies showed that extrasensory perception is inde pendent of time, distance, and mass, it is safe to state that clairvoyance and astral projection are identical. The coordinate system used determines the way Reality is seen. Information is a fundamental quantity. There is a uniform potential - or m edium of potential - which has a data field. In other words, information is everywhe re. it is absorbed in a subjectively chosen manner; then the hallucination manifests, per ceived as a personal reality. Using today's computer-chip technology, if one has enough information to ask a cohe rent question, one also has the information to answer it. Depending on how one accesse s and"},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"assimilates that information, receiving an answer is quite simple, or extre mely difficult. The answer is contained within the question. If the information is ass imilated properly, the answer is clear. The more detail put into the question, the more data th ere is to work with. Information is everywhere, and is independent of everything known today. I t is like a data field that transcends the concepts of time, space, or distance. Tradition ally, energy has been a function of distance (1/R 2) but, in actuality, it is a function of time (a vari able for dissipation and an unknown \"X\" factor. the integral of this is equal to t he information and is, itself, independent of distance, time, and that \"X\" factor. Energy is n ot independent. Energy is being manipulated and controlled by information; it is a way of trans mitting information. Basically, all of the above are perceptual hallucinations. Extrasensory perce ption information is only brought into consciousness via some form of perceptual m etaphor: it is either \"seen, heard, or felt\". In actual fact, consciousness is literally e verywhere, permeating the field of information. It all depends upon how one wishe s to view it. The following postulates tie together all the information given earlier. I t is postulated that: 1. Consciousness is everywhere (now-here). In ordinary states of consciousn ess, one is limiting his perception of what is actually occurring through limiting th e way one is receiving the information (sensory filtering). Examine this concept under the definition of Time. It will be found that Time is nothing more than the \"duration of consciousness\". From an Information Theory point -of-view, tomorrow is occurring right now, and each of us is simply not consciously aware of it yet. What someone tells you today is already affecting what you will do and think \"tomorr ow\". It is possible to have this awareness. However, it requires an altered stat e, which is where extrasensory perception occurs. Altered states of consciousness are di scussed in greater detail in later chapters. 2. Since extrasensory perception is independent of time, the phenomen a - Time - is basically an illusion. In other words, the way one perceives what is going on is totally opti onal, and one may learn to control Time with various forms of hypnosis. Student Comment: How did we get to the future if you are still talking ab out the \"now?\" The future hasn't happened yet. Answer: What is being said right now is already programming the future. Fo r example: \"Tomorrow, I want you to meet me at ten o'clock because I have more data about h ypnosis for you.\" Certain options, or avenues, are now open for you to act upon. Scientists have found that many cultures work on a different time durat ion concept: the Hopi Indians, the Trobinder Indians, the Bhuddists. Time does not work i n terms of duration, which is the way we have been socially programmed to view it. In fact, s ocial programming does change in hypnotic states, where you change your experience of information. That is exactly what occurs in precognition. You are allowing yoursel f to experience it as the now because the boundary conditions which limi t ego-consciousness have been suspended."},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"Student Comment: But the sum consensus of reality... Answer: That is what this is all about...moving away from consensus as a criterion for reality. When an altered state of consciousness is experienced, there is no consensus which is relevant. It is an altered pattern. What is defined as \"reality\" in our culture's consensus opinion is not what the Hopi Indians would call reality. They would say that the closest thing to Reality i s the dream state. To the Hopi Indian, the dream state contains more information on Real ity than your conscious, waking state. In all essence, consensus is a large subjective vie w, having nothing to do with defining the gamut of possible experiences, or events, let alo ne Reality. Sensory perception of consensus reality is always in explicate form. Reality is of an im plicate nature, but is - knowable.

The physical body (Malkuth) stops right here. \"I am as I am,\" ego-consciousne ss. Everything that is contained within this epidural layer of mass was conside red \"me\" and everything outside the skin was the external world, the \"not me.\" The myst ical traditions included the aura. Today it is recognized that odor is also a part of the body, as i s a verbal area around the body, radiating out. Now the \"me\" has a periphery around it, all connected to the ego's sense of \"me.\" The moon also affects the central nervous system activity. It, for instance, st arts ovulation, and has a variety of mood controls. It turns on the various endocrine systems. It has s o much to do with Man, that actually, Man is connected to the moon. This connection is imagined as Path 32, and all of its correspondences and ramifications. It is ju st the way one's perception of reality functions which informs us where \"me\" stops and \"the moon\" starts. These distinctional differences are the realm of internal t opology. 1. PHILOSOPHY a. Transitional Phase: The Tree of Life, Topological Modeling, and Informa tion Theory Active participation in the realm of the imagination is central to psychology, alc hemy, magick (QBL), and physics. Many, but not all, of the imaginal modes involve the conc epts of topology and topography. Within the context of the topological fantasy, the various forms of ordering (Tree of Life, Isotropic Vector Matrix, planes of conscious ness, etc.) provide a comprehensive means of ascertaining the values of any system of exper iences. A topological model for going within describes the internal regions in term s of places, and provides a \"roadmap\" for the soul. However, this map is not the territory."},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"Topology is the study of a place; in this case the inner regions of the Collect ive Unconscious, as traditionally described in QBL. Topography informs us of the features of a region. It accounts for the relation of a part to the whole, and the whole to the part . It is one method of describing conditions within the holomovement. Any region ( Sphere of the Tree of Life) has inherent characteristics, and also a position within t he Whole circuit of the Tree. Topology has been called the science of separation and connection. Topology is the science of fundamental pattern and structural relationsh ips of event constellations. It was discovered and developed by the mathematician Eul er. He discovered that all patterns can be reduced to three prime conceptual characteri stics: to lines; points where two lines cross or the same line crosses itself; and areas, bounde d by lines. (2) The Spheres and Paths of the Tree of Life conform to this definition, rep resenting the entirety of psychic life with a minimal number of graphic elements. In this case, topology offers a descriptive basis for both meditation and exploration of the imaginal realm. The ancient Hebrew text, Sephir Yetzirah, The Book of Formation, descri bes the emanation (or unfolding from implicate to explicate) of the ten spheres of the Tree of Life. The spheres are connected to one another by twenty-two paths, which corre spond to the Hebrew letters (Path O=Aleph, Path I=Beth, Path II=Gimel, etc.). Toget her, these bounded regions (spheres) and connecting paths form a map of the Universe. They are so metimes described as 32 Paths, counting the 10 Spheres + 22 Paths, altogether. Both spheres and paths represent discreet domains which order di verse contents. The contents of any domain are determined by the archetypal dominant residing at the core of the content in question. In general, spheres represent modes-of-be ing, and paths represent transition stages, or gates between them. Qabalah presents the individual soul as a Microcosm which is a reflecti on of the Celestial Man, or Macrocosm. (3) This universal man illustrates the Hermetic Axiom: \"As Above, So Below.\" INSERT DRAWING TRANSITION PHASES: PATHS OF THE TREE Thus man has the option of participating consciously in the divine process of creation. The importance of the act of decision for behavior or transformation lies mainly i n the fact that by it the individual changes his \"position.\" A \"path\" is a change of positi on within a field which otherwise remains sufficiently constant. It is an abbreviated re presentation of a sequence of situations. A path permits change between regions. This is both conceptual and physi cal change. The actions which are represented in the life-space as regions are coexist ing manifolds which possess a certain structure and a certain degree of differentiation. The se \"regions\" are the spheres of the Tree of Life. The imaginal paths of the Tree of Life are linked to the concept of locomotion . They require a journey, or \"working\" by the aspirant in a process in time. The ps ychological region in which these processes occur determines the dynamic cond ition of the individual."},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"There is pause for consideration in the fact that pathworking is a form of \" locomotion\". It is O, THE FOOL who makes the journey through the winding paths of the Tree via Tarot imagery. He is nowhere (now-here) because of his ability to make quantum leap s. He is thus gripped by only one story at a time, which contains many images and its own inherent rhythm. Thus, spheres represent \"Being\", and THE FOOL \"Becoming\", tr ansformed through his experiences on the various paths. When one changes position, different loco-motions become possible and impos sible. Even when a region is still attainable, the course of the path followed has change d fundamentally because of the new point of departure. This point of departure is \"where you are at.\" Tree of Life modeling may be used to classify the values of any given mystical e xperience, psychological state, or emotional bias in terms of its hierarchical system. I t may also be used to see how the many relate to the One, using a polytheistic orientation i n which consciousness circulates among a field of powers. Each God, or complex, is sover eign in its domain. The linear, developmental approach is monotheistic. In the polythei stic model, there is a circulation in which there are no preferred positions. In data study, there are many different ways the data field may be represente d. The major distinction is between positional codewords (Spheres) and those wh ich are commutive (Paths). QBL is a coded system. The codewords are arrayed within a hierarchy, an d the resultant data field takes on a distinctly patterned appearance. This inf ormation handling system permits the conceptual co-ordination of several features at the same time. The aspirant conforms to the changing circumstances in which he operates. There are definite steps in setting up a system of information access: 1. Analyze the questions to be asked. This determines the type of index be st suited to information retrieval, which types of items will be programmed, and what modes of access are to be used. 2. Compile a collection of features, or correspondences. If many of these feat ures are unknown, set up an orderly system of listing them as they are discovered (suc h as Tree of Life). 3. Based on #1 and #2, estimate the number of items and features to be classifie d. Note rates of growth, change, or removal in any positional category of the index. All indexes are descriptive in a sense--features and items descri be each other--but in some cases the terms of one sort are arranged in hierarchies so as to produce posit ional codewords which describe the terms of the other. The positional effec t is latent the moment a hierarchy is made, and becomes overt when a single set of ordered characters is used time and time again, once in each position available in the codewords it makes. When ite ms are arranged in order by means of a hierarchy of features we have a classification of t he items concerned. Hierarchical indexes form an important part of data study. They can be of use when no mechanism for logical description is available to aid in searches, when positi onal"},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"codewords are needed, and when an index is called upon to reflect the structure of a subject which is itself hierarchical. (4) In QBL, Spheres are defined by these positional codewords include the names of the spheres, titles, god-names, archangels, choir of angels, planetary attribution s, spiritual experience, virtues and vices, and other corresponding symbols. All have a posi tional slot within a Sphere or Path. Within each Sphere, they are arranged in an array on variou s planes in a mini-hierarchy. This array of angelic entities functions as th e \"governing body\" or holy ruling order of the internal realm of manifestation. The continuum of the data field has a relationship to the circuit of the Tr ee of Life. It has a zero, a place of no information, which can be thought of as a decision point. Above t his point, there is the graphic range of subcodes (corresponding colors, perfum es, animals, etc), then the generic point of individual fully generic terms whic h are irreducible to simpler forms. Then there is the direct range of increasingly complic ated descriptive phrases. The generic term (Sphere name: Kethar, Tiphareth, Yesod, etc.) is de scribed by its own synonyms and describes its structure or function through a word or image which is its coded definition. This generic classification system allows for a variet y of integrative levels. In an assembly of these generic terms, order does not matter since the y all act together. An ordered assembly is necessary for conceptual clarity. A sphere has the co mplete set of subsystems needed in order to remain in balance with its surrounding s. Its internal environment remains constant in the face of changing external circumstanc es. Thus, our personal conceptualizations of the definitions of the various S pheres on different integrative levels affect the homeostasis of the organism we are temporari ly inhabiting. The more firmly we conceptualize and integrate the qualities of a given sphe re, the greater its ability to manifest in our life in a balanced manner. There is no split bet ween psyche and soma: things, qualities, occurrences and changes appear throughout the se t of planes or integrative levels. Furthermore, the qualities of the lower levels per sist in the higher regions, i.e. there is a Malkuth of the Archetypal Plane, and there is a condi tion in which Kether is in Malkuth of the Physical Plane. One's worldview or pattern of meaning has boundary conditions. W e select the contents of our data field from the set of all the terms we may ever be called upon to consider. One's worldview or pattern of meaning has boundary conditions. We select t he contents of our data field from the set of all the terms we may ever be called upon t o consider. The most effective way of imagining these contents is fundamental to both easter n and western philosophy. Being and consciousness are arrayed in a hierarchy of dimensional levels, wh ich range from the lowest, densest and most isolated particles to the highest, most subtle unified level. This holistic paradigm asserts that the universe is hierarchically orga nized through an interconnecting series of planes. The nature of these planes altern ates. What is implicate at one level, is explicate on the next lower plane. Each plane is implicate to its predecessor, but explicate to its successor. For example the astral is implicate to matter and explicate to mind."},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"Theoretical QBL, with its paradigm of the Four Worlds, creates a map or cartogr aphy of the higher, transcendental spheres. This is useful as an aid for those asp irants who hat yet seen them. It builds a cognitive framework, by which to classify mystical expe riences. The Tree of Life circuit functions as a mandalic map. To test this map in its e ntirety, you need merely transform yourself enough to experience these realms. This requ ires an altered state of consciousness, and can never be verified through objective, empiri cal investigation. The final stages transcend the mind, itself, with all of its conceptuali zations concerning \"the way things work.\" Worldviews may be classified into two main divisions: 1). analytic (or reducti ve ego- consciousness,) and 2). holistic (unifying, diffuse awareness of anima-c onsciousness). Both of these represent Reality; they are, in fact, complementary modes, not an tagonists. The fundamental quantity which unites these viewpoints is information. Information Theory defines \"information\" strictly in terms of a relation ship between an input and a receiving device. An information theory model of the Qabalah views the aspirant as the receptor of information. Some occultists like to call the mselves \"channels\", and it is this type of \"reception\" to which we refer. In order to create a situation where communication is possible, it is necessary to define a channel and level of observation. In QBL, the level of observation is known as a plane, and paths of the Tree func tion as channels for information flow. Each channel and level has a specific nat ure or characteristics, and a set repertoire of symbols corresponding to the sit uation. This repertoire of symbols is the correspondence system, which includes colors, perfumes, animals, God-forms, orders of angels, etc. There are boundary conditions or constr aints upon the transmitter's freedom of choice. The archetype is the transmitter, and because of the constraints on it s forms of expression, it manifests with a high redundancy coefficient. The more familiar you ar e with its characteristics, the more its appearance takes on a chronic aspect, rathe r than seeming magically synchronistic. In other words, you become used to it, and its message i s therefore less original, but more precisely defined as time goes on. The information i s more detailed. Like QBL, the very essence of information theory involves the schematizati on of reality. It cuts through complexity to the most fundamental intelligible concepti on. Both QBL and information theory invoke the concepts of code, originality, signification, and redundancy. The value of learning the QBL correspondence system so it becomes secon d nature emerges from information theory. QBL organizes the code system which is spontaneou sly produced by the subconscious. When we learn QBL, we learn to speak this language of the subconscious. This awareness of the inherent meaning in symbols and for ms is the basis of psychology's effectiveness. In information theory terms: \"Translating the message into a special language adapted to the channel in order to increase the channel's i nformation rate is called coding. Determine the exact nature of information, the repertoi re, and the repertoire's elements...A message of maximum information may appear sens eless if the individual cannot decode it in order to make it intelligible.\" (5) Information theory defines \"form\" as a message which appears to the observer as not being the result of random events. This definition of \"form\" is loose en ough to account for"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"the perception of entities on subtle planes, where form is not synonym ous with matter. And in fact, we find mediums which claim that these \"entities\" do disp ense \"information.\" This information is accepted as an input which leads to a unique adaptation to th e environment. Their perception is enhanced through selection of their channel. Thu s apprehension of \"reality\" is conditioned by perceptual selection. Another tenet of information theory holds that if a message contains too much i nformation, it exceeds our capacity for understanding and creates boredom. From this , we may deduce that there is no way to ever fully integrate any archetype. Any contact with the awesomeness of its potency will eventually generate movement away from it, t hrough growing lack of interest. As more knowledge of it is gleaned, the implicat e aspect of the sphere above it becomes more intriguing. So, even though we move up the Tre e from sphere to sphere, there is never an exhaustion of transmittable inform ation, at any level. Absence of structure of internal organization is connected with too large of a flow of information. This chaotic condition is the initial reaction of the ego to th e vastness of the transcendental planes of experience. Without a conceptual framework for di gesting small amounts of information from these dimensions, they are unimaginable and uni ntegratable. Using the orderly pattern of QBL, objects and substances (talismans), e vents and processes (chronicites, pathworking, and rituals), collective concepts of all types ( archetypes), and many other special varieties of terms each have their niche. The informati on theory approach, and QBL assume a unified study of these, forming a system which op erates at full efficiency. Of particular importance is the study of relationship s within the data field, including exclusiveness, overlap, complementarity, etc. QBL is simul taneously a monotheistic and polytheistic philosophical system. Most individuals do not have either the emotional or intellectual capaci ty to comprehend \"God\" as an all-inclusive principle. Those who do are known as Masters or Sain ts. We may, however, differentiate discreet aspects of the psyche through their corresponding states of consciousness. Even a monotheistic view of God posits divine attri butes or characteristics. In polytheistic systems, these are presented in god-forms of various dei ties. Each is sovereign in its realm, and has the capacity to influence the human body, emot ions, ideas, and spiritual experience. Existing independent of space and time, th ey are equiprobable. Thus an image is not pre-determined or predictable. It is direct per ceptual experience of the unknown, or implicate order. The appearance of a symbol, however, allows us t o infer manifestation of corresponding processes which will occur either in s pace or time (explicate form). Symbols are useful for transformation because they function as both a prim itive expression of the unconscious and an idea corresponding to the highest intuitions of the ego- consciousness. Symbols are held enfolded in the net of an image. The predictability of sym bols and the unique quality of symbols contained in an image shows a relationship betw een implicate and explicate order. Symbols are an important practical tool for manipulating exp licate"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"order. Symbols are an important practical tool for manipulating explicate orde r, for unfolding it. They are fundamental components in the language of the psych e. Symbols are best catalogued by correspondence with their ruling principle. Since all parts of the process are inferred, or enfolded, by a symbol, they allow u s to predict future occurrences within the framework of probability. Given an elaborat e, but limited repertoire of symbols, there is an upper limit to information output. Uni form distribution, or equiprobability, offers the maximum possible choice in constructin g a message. In a mystical experience, there is a communication between a human rec eptor and a god- form. The archetype makes its presence known through corresponding image ry. To simulate its eternal aspect, it reiterates itself over-and-over in a s ymbiotic relationship with humanity. In other words, while we cannot assimilate maximum information which is the archetype itself, we can decode an optimal amount of relative information through the correspondence system. Repetition, or redundancy, increases the poss ibility that the message will be noticed. One is able to establish a conscious relationship with the archetype. To give it attention is to give it worship. A message has a degree of predictability which is in ration to its degree of coherence, or regularity. Foresight is enhanced by knowledge of what symbols are componen t parts of specific archetypal patterns. If one of the symbols presents itself, th ere is a high degree of probability others with the same theme will follow. The presence of t he entire process is inferred from viewing a part of it. This part is the unfolding of a portion of the implicate order. The concept of information unifies analytic and holographic concepts of real ity. The essential point is that both the analytic and holographic models refer t o processes for generating information--and information itself is a holistic concept...In the analytical model information results from the selection of a particular ou tcome from a set of possibilities. In the holographic model information results from t he selection of a particular outcome from a set of possibilities. In the holographic model inform ation results from an analog mechanism that allows two states to interact wit h each other. Thus, although the analytic and holographic models refer to distinct means of generating information, they both rest on holistic assumptions and can be cons idered as complementary holistic models. Furthermore, because the analytic and hologr aphic models both refer to the generation of information, information theory is re vealed to be an underlying structure that can integrate both the analytic and holographic models...A general theory of consciousness needs to be based on holistic assumpti ons and needs to utilize information theory...providing a hierarchical structure w hich can relate the different forms of consciousness to each other. ...Although ther e is no standard nomenclature of states of consciousness any complete theory must address a wide variety of states of consciousness including sensation, perception , emotion, cognition, intuition, self-awareness and unition (transpersonal consciousn ess).

In fact, the st ates of consciousness listed correspond directly with features of the Tre e of Life: sensation=Malkuth, perception=Path 32, emotion=Yesod, cognition-Hod, intuition=Netzach, self-awareness =Tiphareth, and unition=Kether. Bo th analytic and holographic models are useful in understanding these states. This mea ns cognitive and experiential development should keep pace with one another for balanced d evelopment. In Buddhism, there is a merging of the Path of Form, and the Path of Non-Fo rm where active invoking of images is balanced by a detached observation/participation in the rising and passing away of phenomena. This is a variation of \"rising on the planes.\" Arche typal topographies define the relationships among archetypes, how they tend to clu ster among themselves. Examination of the variety of such attempts to pattern and group archetypes is i tself a valuable exercise in exploring archetypal imagination. What kind of consciousne ss is it that perceives in terms of organization, integration, and preferred positioning of Gods? Generally, the attempt to discover a unifying wholeness or impose a distinc t pattern onto archetypal groupings is a procedure dominated by the archetype of Self. (7) INSERT DRAWING INFORMATION + CONSCIOUSNESS The Tree of Life, like the Buddhist Refuge Tree is \"not a map of the gener alized field of the psyche.\" Buddhist psychology has a definite purpose--liberation or transcendence. As s uch it can be described by the fantasy of growth and goal orientation. I should quickly point out that this is not the totality of Buddhist Mahayana teaching, which also in cludes the Prajnaparamita, by which such concepts as goals, liberation and so on are declared empty of substance. (8) This \"emptying\" is characterized on the Tree if Life as Daath. Bear in m ind that Jung warned of the danger in identifying with the image of tree, or the Self. Th e image of the Tree with its associated topography is a tool which is not to become a deified sym bol of wholeness. It is merely a vehicle for exploration. Basically, the Tree repre sents the moment when individuation culminates in the fulfillment of Kether. It i s the conclusion of the evolutional unfolding and enfolding of the soul: a return to the fountainh ead of the soul. The process includes apprehension on the physical, biological, mental, su btle, causal, and ultimate levels. We can make a comparative analysis of planes of consciousness as described by modern psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists with ancient systems of the perennial philosophy such as Yoga and Magick. Remember, though, that no study however exhaustive takes the place of person al experience of these planes, and the only means of access to them is via transf ormation: the transition from one mode of consciousness to another.

Ritual: The Spiritual Hierarchy and Assuming the Godform Both Magick and Yogic traditions assert that the Spiritual Hierarchy consi sts of galaxies of lords, rulers, creators, and governors of the various heavenly spheres. Each plan e, or subdivision, has its governing body. These god-like powers have certain appoi nted functions and duties. They are, in fact, administrators in the sacred ru ling order. All are subsumed ultimately by one supreme, infinite Essence. Human Beings are related to these governing entities through the quality of s oul and archetypal processes. Individuals are imbued with attitudes, functi ons, and behavior motivated by these various planetary rulers, usually unbeknownst to thems elves. It is not only the Supreme Being that is endowed with creative power. Thes e lords and rulers have the power of creation in their sphere. There are many gods, and th eir powers and authority varies widely, but the One God is supreme. Most of the religions of the world worship the creator god of the physical plan e, confusing him with the Ultimate. His realm is actually quite limited and his function includes seeing to it that the souls who are still attached to phenomenal experience (inc luding physical, astral, and causal) don't reach liberation, escaping the wheel of birth and death. He is the apparently supreme master of these souls. To mystics, he is the Negative Power, who keeps us hung up in illusory levels through the fascination of the mind. He is not evil, but merely a lesser good, who fulfills his role. Only the absolute represents the Tru th of Existence. The gods exist in a symbiotic relationship with humanity. We serve them an d they serve us, providing we learn how to contact them consciously. All souls begin hum an life serving the negative power of phenomenal manifestation. This is the realm of the five pas sions: anger, greed, attachment, lust and pride. Both Magick and Yoga provide remedies which allow the soul to begin its journ ey home. The Magickal technique begins with the following: 1). Rigorous practice in the development of visualization ability. 2). Thorough study of the characteristic god-forms, powers, functions, and attributes of each sphere. This research is enhanced by outings to museu ms and art galleries, viewing aesthetic representations of the gods in great paintin gs and sculpture. Literature makes a wide range of references to the gods. 3). The astral god form is contemplated in creative imagination daily until its radiant form takes on dynamic life to the aspirant. 4). Presuming the rite is absolutely necessary for the aspirant, s/he now pr oceeds to the ceremony of invocation, the calling of the form into the magickal circle . 5).

Each moves him one step up the ladder of the plane s, until he embodies perfect realization of the qualities of all these entit ies (Kether). He arrives at the One through the many. The technique of Shabd Yoga is similar, with one critical difference: a perfect, living Master.

The technique resembles Middle Pillar Exercise in the recitati on of God-names with banishings to assure the authenticity of the astral form of the Master. Somet imes lower entities masquerade as higher forms. The soul still meets with bani shings to assure the authenticity of the astral form of the Master. Sometimes lower entities masquerade as higher forms. The soul still meets with the governors of the planes (as in m agick), asking each how it may then ascend higher. They are Master's representatives who aid the initiate on the Way of Return. He is the King of the sacred ruling order of existence. Most of the psychological symbols of the causal plane will still manifest in t roublesome form through the complexes, and analysis of these is useful for self-re alization. However, psychological hermeneutics does not have the power to penetrate past the cau sal plane of the mind. It interprets the veils of maya with \"meaningful\" concepts. An advantage of the Path of the Masters is that a living being is easier to truly love , than a cosmic function, no matter how \"real\" it may seem in imagination. The Master is a living example of the goal of human life, providing the aspirant with a sense of humil ity, surrender, and compassion. He embodies the ultimate god-form on all planes of existence simultaneously, a very comprehensive symbol. The soul gravitates toward the heart's desire. If this is love for the Maste r, one joins him in Sat Lok. If it is for continued sensate experience, the soul remains attac hed to phenomena. A Master loosens the attachment to the physical plane. Magick exalts the senses to the point of satiety. With desire fulfilled, th e soul rises to higher planes. The Master also functions in this way as one becomes filled wit h his presence. c. PRACTICAL QBL: Pathworking; Inroads of the Imagi nation Pathworking is a magickal practice which differs from ceremonial invocati on. Instead of calling in a godform into a circle, the aspirant \"journeys\" to the imaginal locat ion of an archetypal Form. This pathworking is a mediating act which occurs in imaginat ion. The imaginal world lies between the empirical and conceptual realms. This i maginal world is known to psychologists as a realm of psyche, or the soul."},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"How do we gain access to this realm? Once we recognize imagination as the real m of soul, we require a method through which we can explore the soul through imaginat ion. The paths of the Tree of Life function as metaphorical \"in-roads\". Their corre spondences produce an awareness of soul through its own system of metaphorical language. All three types of pathworking require a preliminary study of the charact eristics and qualities of the Spheres and Paths. Study the correspondence system un til its metaphors are second nature, and instantly recognizable as attributes of a specific qu ality. The physical aspect of pathworking includes the life experiences wh ich precipitate into daily life as the result of an astral pathworking. These images require m etaphorical interpolation into conceptual forms through meditation. Tree of Life pathworking offers a way of \"finding\" or \"locating\" archetypes i n imaginal space. Each successive pathworking increases the area of perceptible i nner space. 1. At this stage of practice, the elusiveness of the image is exaggerated by the easily distracted attention of the aspirant. Some seek a short-cut to the higher p lanes through recourse to drugs. These promote trance-like states, and produce hall ucinatory perception which is not confused with imagination by the well-informed studen t. This may in no manner be likened to pathworking, nor substituted in its place. The ego i s absent, or incapacitated by the overpowering force of the unconscious. He is overwhelme d in a regression of consciousness. This is known as Prototaxic Mode (Gowan, 1975). It i s not an in-road, but a premature invasion by the unconscious forces. 2. The major purpose of a pathworking is to produce a conscious contact with the archetypal powers connected with the particular path. There are active an d passive forms of pathworking, but do not let this glib terminology lead you astray. \"Passive\" in th is sense does not imply the ineffective attitude of type 1 experience. Both active and passive styles are required for the aspirant's training. Each is appropriate in a differe nt context. Active pathworking is analogous to the psychological exercise known as active im agination. This exercise of the creative imagination is an excursion into the astral p lane through the faculty known as clairvoyance, a combination of ego-will and imagination. Pathwork ing produces an imagery state known as the Parataxic Mode (Gowan, 1975). It surpasses sensory information processing, but precedes conceptual lucidity. This is not a trance state where the images transform freely from one form to another. It is an artform . Clairvoyance means seeing the inner world with increasing clarity. This clarity comes through ego's conscious participation. the main use of active pathworking is for introspection. In pathworking, the will forces the image to maintain cert ain parameters. The \"will,\" in turn, is brought into direct, non-verbal contact with th e non-rational. The aspirant is forced into situations which requires immediate reaction s through feelings or instincts. The will maintains a sense of responsibility for ego's behavior on the inner planes. Both cognitive and emotional perception are involved. The ego's forceful elabor ation helps to ensure the unfolding of a particular imaginative sequence. An active pathworking traces the routes described in QBL as the trans ition stages between Spheres. A pathworking begins in one sphere, and culminates in the sph ere immediately"},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"higher on the Middle Pillar. The peripheral paths join various spheres of the Tree in an orderly pattern. Any time two particular terminals are used, the traveler e stablishes a contact with both the \"place\" and the \"entities\" who are to be found inh abiting the area. With repetition, the imaginal reality of the place is confirmed through pe rsonal experience. The aspirant becomes an accepted visitor in these regions. All pathworkings return the traveler to the point of origin. This is why t he ego must be able to maintain concentration and follow through. It is important to have a well defined intention in any work of this nature . The symbol system to be used as a guide line was that of the 32nd Path of the Tree of Life, for th e traditional technique is to start in an imaginary temple representing the Sephirah from which one starts, to picture the relevant Tarot Trump on one side of this tem ple, to pass through the Trump as into a picture and proceed through whatever scenery and experiences one may find until one comes to a central point, the Hebrew lette r allocated to the Path. From thence one continues the imaginary journey unti l just before the further Sephirah one meets the relevant astrological symbol, an d shortly after views the further Sephirah of the Path. One then returns by the w ay one came, recapitulating briefly all that one met on the way out. This step is most impor tant, particularly in the fact that it is a preparation for more advanced work when the pictures of the visual imagination give way to actual flora, fauna and locations of th e objective Astral Plane, when to be lost with no plan of return can be a serious mat ter. (9) 3. Passive Pathworking is not a contradiction in terms, but indicates that ego-consciousness is present, though it does not calculatingly interfere with the unfoldi ng of psychic imagery. This passive working is actually more advanced because the traveler mus t employ his creativity or ability to synthesize information. The practitioner requi res an ability to deal with opening of the lower, as well as the higher mind. This form of pathworking uses a doorway of some type to initiate the experie nce. This might again be a Tarot Card, or an I Ching Hexagram, last night's dream image, etc. The difference is that instead of following procedure instructions on where to go, and what to visualize (from the correspondence system), one allows the pathworking i tself to present the images. This passive pathworking may be likened in some respects to what is term ed \"archetypal imagination\" in 3rd Generation Jungian Psychology. This is an authentic visionary m ode of experience. It is a causal level experience which produces keen per ception or insight. The distinction between the magickal and Jungian models is that the magick al model employs the Body of Light as the vehicle for travel of the aspirant. This shape must be k ept in awareness at all times. If the main purpose of pathworking is to contact the archetypal power behin d it, an examination of the meaning of \"archetypal\" ought to be firmly established i n the aspirant's mind. Archetypal Theory in modern psychology asserts four general premises:"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"1. Archetypes are located in the soul. 2. Psychopathology is emphasized. 3. Archetypes are decidedly important and numinous. 4. The ego is desubstantiated in a radical sense. (10) In archetypal psychology, pathology is recognized as an essential component of the h uman soul. Therefore, these psychologists explore the divine by insight into the light and dark aspects of the gods. \"The dark Gods and the dark sides of all the Gods came to r eceive special emphasis. For the Greeks, it would seem, have left us a legacy in thei r varied divine images of darkness, death, and perversion--a means for us to redeem the digni ty in much of our suffering.\"(11) The ego is relativized in this operation, because it com es to understand that the divine forces are so powerful, the ego cannot really \"do\" anything to the m. Ego becomes one archetypal perspective, with no necessity for strengtheni ng or humbling. Archetypal Psychology recognizes the many varieties of consciousness i ndicated in QBL by planetary attributions, \"freeing individuation from stereotypes of an ego on the road to a Self. By reflecting this plurality and freedom of styles within the structures of myth, the archetypal perspective to experience may be furthered.\" (12) Archetypal Imagination is one phase beyond active imagination. The paradox is that active imagination, though permitting a first glimpse int o this extra-personal domain, is not by itself adequate as a means of exploring the entirety of such a domain. The core of active imagining remains, in Jung's words, \"a method of introspection for observing the stream of interior images.\" (CW 9: i, meani ng, but to enter the archetypal region itself an archetypal or visionary imagination is r equired which by its very nature transcends active imagining . (13) Since there are no procedural constraints in this passive pathworking, j ust what can the aspirant expect to experience through this awakened visionary mode? Archetypal Imagination \"combines the necessity of specific acts of consc iousness with entry into a domain that is extraconscious and even extrahuman . . . it is nonetheless not t he most ultimate region of human experience.\" (14) This is the realm of true inne r plane contact. It is through this form of imagination that we come to know archetypes. There is no name for what is now imagined visionarily other than the names given to it -- names that are themselves always plural in form -- in folklore, in class ical Greek mythology, in the symbols of dreams. If it is true, as Hillman suggests, that it is \"through the imagination that man has access to the Gods\", this access is attained on ly through a genuinely archetypal imagination and, further, the deities reached in thi s way are named conjointly. To recognize this is not to revert to nominalism, for the names in question convey presences -- they are presences. (15) There is only a sense of radically shifting modes of awareness as the mind mi grates from the nameless and nonfixed nature of conscious imagining, through the singul arly named"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"and potently personified contents of passive and active imagining, to the colle ctively named Names -- to the archetypes, to the gods -- of luminously visionary imagination . (16) Casey (1974) makes it clear that \"a visionary imagination is capable of disclosing a crowded canvas of angels or demons, planetary gods or super-celestial beings.\" (17) This mode of pathworking is inherently suitable for Middle Pillar work. I f imagination mediates, it does so in a distinctive and irreplaceable manner. This is ab ove all true of an archetypal imagination, which provides a necessary and unique medium with in which archetypal realities come to be reflected in the form of vibrant images. Archetypal imagining as a via media is uneliminable insofar as it supplies structur e to what is psychically real. As genuinely intermediate, it surpasses sensible par ticularity while foreshadowing strictly formal or ideational modes of being. It offers both a w ay out of the snares of sensationalized and a way toward a sphere of being that is ontologically u ltimate. (18) These three methods if interaction with the subconscious forces m ay be summarized as follows: 1. The ego feels proud in its control fantasy of imagination. When this confident ego meets with the true numinous power of the unconscious, it's image of its elf fragments. The \"opposites\" are now constellated, demanding some form of reconciliation. 2. The stunned ego eventually develops a means of coping with the avenging unconscious. Since synthesis of conscious and unconscious has becom e an imperative necessity, images of focusing and centering appear. Active i magination is appropriate at this stage. The symbols of the Self constellate to reintegrat e the fragmented personality. 3. Finally, one develops a sense of archetypal topography as a means of experiencing an archetypally structured world. This mode of apperception is visionary imagination, an interaction of an individual with divine, immortal Forms. ACTIVE IMAGINATION EXERCISE Procedure: Marie Louise VonFranz has formatted Active Imagination into five major step s. The preliminary phase includes establishing the intent or goal of the operati on. I. First, one must empty one's mind from the trains of thought of the e go. II. Then comes the second step: It is the phase of letting an unconsciou s fantasy image enter into the field of inner attention...focus on it, and here one has to look out for two kinds of mistake: either one focuses too much and this arrests th e image, fixing it literally so to speak, or one focuses too little and then the inner im ages are apt to change too quickly - a kind of \"inner cinema\" begins to run."},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"III. This consists in giving the fantasy some form of expression; in writing i t down, painting it, sculpting or noting the music which one one heard, or in dancin g it. In the latter case, the body comes into it which is sometimes very necess ary...It often also helps to perform a small ritual like lighting a candle, walking in a circ le, etc. IV. The fourth step is the decisive one where most other modern paralle l techniques miss out. It is the ethical confrontation with whatever one has previous ly produced. Here Jung warns against a most frequent and fatal mistake: namely that one ent ers the \"inner play\" with a fictitious ego and not with one's own true ego. (To ge t the full effect don't just watch yourself doing these things. Be the uniqu e individual you are, interacting with the images of inner space. Once the experiment i s begun, the ego is compelled to participate.) V. Finally, there is one more step...one has to apply whatever is said, ordered or asked for in active imagination to ordinary life. (19) Dangers: 1) There is the chance of repressed unconscious forces breaking throu gh into daily life, overcoming and usurping the position of the ego. The higher and lower astral p lane are opened and the traveler meets terrifying beings or circumstances beyo nd his ken. These waking nightmares loose one's own greatest fears. Frequently, they center ar ound past trauma. Active Imagination is a means of facing up to and dealing with these shad owy problems. 2) Psychosomatic manifestations, such as changes in blood pressure or heartbeat. The Western alchemists mostly used matter outside their body, asserti ng that \"our soul imagines great things outside the body\" (extra corpus). Paracelsus and his pupil Gerhard Dorn, however, also tried to experiment with \"the inner firmame nt\" within their own bodies with some outer magical performances; these had--per an alogy-- asynchronistic relationship to the matter in the body. Thus active imagin ation is actually very much concerned with the body but essentially with its bas ic chemical components and their symbolic meaning. I have often observed strong physical posi tive and negative reactions in case of a rightly or wrongly conducted active imagination ; one analysand even once suffered a severe but purely psychogenic heart-attack, w hen he betrayed his feelings with an active imagination. A great problem is raised by th e strong affects and emotions. In his own experiment Jung sometimes used yoga exercises to master them first, before he could, so to speak, extract an image from th em to which he could relate in active imagination. (20) 3) Emotional. The individual experiences euphoria from each pathworki ng as the ego identifies with the archetypal contents of the event. There will be a reactionary let down, but this shouldn't last long. 4) Occult lore speaks of the Dweller on the Threshold, where old fears are met. . . . I came into contact with the archetypal forms when an image of the Tarot Old Pan or Devil appeared, unsummoned and unwanted. It was a classic Christian devil wi th an"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"emanation of \"evil\" as real as the beneficence I had felt when interacting w ith the archetype of The Sun. I tried to end the experience by opening my eyes, but I discovered that I was unable to move or perform this simple feat. I was paralyzed. I began to panic. . .The Old Pan entity became even more menacing than before, placing himself in my inner world between me and the stairway to the outer world and s afety. . .blocked my every move. . .He did not advance toward me but remained as a moving blockage to any possible exit. Finally I was able to concentrate on my outer body sufficiently to try to move. . .Using all my will and ignoring the Old Pan figur e entirely, I managed this feat, and it broke the state in which I had been locked. (21) 5) Ritualistic forms of active imagination constellate synchronistic event s. This may be misinterpreted as \"magical\" effects in one's judgment becomes bl urred by excitement. there is a critical distinction between desire or wish fulfill ment of the ego and the experience of true imagination. . . .it is tempting to speak, with Corbin, of visionary imagining as \"magical\". But if i t is magical, it is not merely in Sarte's sense of escaping all causal explanation . Rather, it is a magical act in the spirit of what Paracelsus called \"true imagination\" (I maginatio vera), which transmutes gross matter into subtle, immaterial bodies; or i n the sense of the hermetic psychology of imagination to be found in Pico della Mirandola, Ficino, and Bruno, for all of whom images were talismanic presences of the demonic . (22) Guidelines for Practice: 1) There is no rush to experience every Tarot Path via imagination. Work up the T ree, Path 32, 31, 30, etc. Take it slowly, learning, and assimilating each new experience thoroughly before going on. 2) Insure your freedom from interruption through a Banishing or candle ri te. 3) Establish a time limit; it is a good idea to have a trusted monitor nearby. 4) Record results in your journal, including physical plane reactions, and synchronicities. 5) Never do an active imagination which concerns living persons (this includ es intentional visualization of sexual fantasies). This is unethical as it constitutes an encroachment upon the True Will of others. It is an improper application of the technique. 6) Ground exercises in active imagination by applying the experiences gained i n pathworking to daily life. 7) Try to establish contact with your personal \"inner guide\" who will al ways offer protection if requested and allowed to do so.

Hidden in the depths of the psyche they are systems of readiness for action an d at the same time images and emotions. Indeed, they are its psychic aspect. -- Carl Jung Depth Psychology has provided a great deal of insight concerning human spiritu al or mystical experience. It deals most fully with the individual who may be c haracterized as a seeker. Alchemy and magick were the psychological languages of the past. They wer e the means for realizing the quest, or journey into the depths of the subconsci ous. Today, archetypal psychology shows the efficiency of the old practices, and allows us t o improve our own awareness by drawing from its resources. Psychology provides a technical language which allows us to formulate contempor ary definitions for the spiritual experiences which, in the past, wer e referred to as \"the mysteries.\" The psychological language seems to de-glamorize the occult pr actices; however, it represents a growing conscious understanding of the dynamics involved. Jung developed a model of the psyche from empirical observations made during t he course of his clinical research. Jung saw man, not as an isolated individual, but as havin g links with all mankind through a collective unconscious. This unconscious man ifests in multiple forms. Jung observed that archetypes should not be thought of as nouns, but rather as s emantic metaphors. They represent an \"as if\" reality. They cannot be observed on the pl ane of their existence, directly and finally. However, their existence is inferred through their various forms of representation (imagery). Their areas of influence are field s of potential experience. Jung used a metaphorical model to describe archetypes. He likened them t o dried up river beds, to which the water may return at any time. The waters of life flow in specific patterns which dig deep channels. When the archetypes become activated in an in dividual psyche, these nourishing waters return, flowing through their predetermi ned courses. Archetypes embody paradox. There are certain characteristics of their d ouble existence which we may observe. They may be viewed as uniting apparently irreconcilab le opposites through an underlying continuum. 1. They are full of internal oppositions, positive and negative poles, (i.e. they app ear as good and evil, sometimes simultaneously). 2. They are unknowable and known through images. 3. They are both instinct and spirit, united in a continuum. 4. They are congenital, yet not inherited. 5. They are purely formal structures and contents."},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"6. They are psychic and extrapsychic (psychoid, extending further than the limitations of the psyche). In the past, mankind referred to archetypes as gods and goddesses. It is \"as if\" archetypes compel our behavior until we develop a conscious relationship with the m. In psychological work, their characteristic qualities and effects must be distingui shed one-by-one, for instance, understanding the difference between Hera and Demete r, or Zeus, etc. Relationships of archetypes with one another and to an individual ego are re lated in myth. When one of these godforms interferes in an individual daily life, the manif estation is known as a \"complex.\" The intentional deepening of conscious relationship with various arche types is known in Magick as the exercise of Rising on the Planes. Consciousness moves from pe rception of only the physical world as \"real\" to recognition and observation of the archet ypes on the imaginal/emotional level (astral plane). Later, one learns to perceive their effects on ideas and styles of thinking (causal plane). Look for archetypes in your problems, moods, and ideas. The final change of plane implies union with the archetype one i ts own plane of existence, beyond force and form (archetypal plane). Archetypes express themselves through their fundamental patterns of symbol formation. The collective inheritance is not one of inherited ideas, but of inher ited pathways. Each archetype has characteristic correspondences. They provide an underlyi ng unity for diverse forms of symbolism. These can include god-forms of different cu ltures, colors, plants, animals, parts of the body, psychological states, etc. The symbolic content in fairy tales, religions, sagas, and myth are all similar. Im portance is not found in the actual symbol, but in what it represents of deeper level s of the psyche. Be careful not to confuse archetypal representations like images, ideas, and gods (which are astral and causal plane perceptions) with the archetype as such, which \"lives\" on a higher plane of existence. Archetypes gain life and meaning when the motif is filled out through personal experience. This experience may be apparently mundane. It may also be filled with a se nse of the unknown, and a feeling of sacredness. There is a specific feeling-value attached to archetypal experience. The feeling of absolute correctness it brings is often the source of self-deception. Only total experience, not mere intellectual unde rstanding, can convey the individual value such an encounter brings. The archetype manifests not only as a static image, but also in dynamic process es. The differentiation of a function of consciousness is an example. Perhaps an individual is a \"thinking\" type, out of touch with his feelings. The Self might th en initiate the process whereby he comes to wholeness through experiencing his emotional sensit ivity. There is an archetype behind all processes. As we move toward consciousness of archetypes, our mode of apprehending them alters. First and foremost, they are found in myth, dream and fantasy represented i n the form of Gods (often in contemporary dress). They also influence us in less obviou s ways; 1) they may be projected to someone in the environment (such as someone you despi se carries your"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"shadow qualities), or 2) we may become so fascinated by a powerful archetyp e that we ourselves become possessed, losing conscious control of our thoughts and be havior. (to return to the example above, possession by the shadow would mean acting ou t repressed qualities in antisocial or criminal behavior). When the ego cannot differentiate itself from the archetypes of the uncon scious, it identifies with the energy being released through the archetypal experience and bec omes inflated. Consciousness regresses into a less conscious state, producing a mirage of s uperiority. This is commonly known as an ego-trip. In time, the ego gains a less-biased view of it self and comes to a realistic evaluation of its relationship with totality or the Se lf. The ego learns to understand it does not possess Aphrodite's, or Zeus' powers, and voluntar ily assumes a subordinate role in the psychic economy. When consciousness has developed to the heart level (Tiphareth), light i s generated by insight and we see archetypal processes operating in dynamic flux. One se es through projection and possession from a level beyond the ego. One watches the gods as the y motivate behavior and cause changes in attitudes, beliefs, and ideas. These ar e indispensable steps on the path to individuation or coming to wholenes s. In this manner we may consciously adapt to our fate, transmuting it into inner experience. Re-assimilating (or recognizing) projections allows the freed libido t o activate a function bridging conscious and unconscious, increasing self-knowledge. This e nergy which formerly went into maintaining an extroverted illusion now is free to mediate a subtler perception. Gods or archetypes do not appear in isolation; they are always found i n characteristic relationships with one another. Once you perceive archetypal material manifesting in your life, and begi n to distinguish one god from another, your mental imagery might be expected to come more sharp ly into focus. Archetypes on the inner planes produce a quasi- or partial conscious . They behave like independent personalities. The archetypal dominant in a given pers on's life determines the life-theme most frequently repeated (see Pantheon: Arche typal Encounters in Daily Living). Archetypes produce behaviour patterns. Conscious control of life b y the ego is a mere fantasy. Archetypes are also revealed in art, dreams, mandalas, tarot cards, idiographs , and glyphs. In these cases, the presentational form is not necessarily personalized . One uses a standardized card, for instance, as a medium to communicate with one's s elf, and moves to the more basic level represented by the symbol content of that card. A ll forms of art express the collective unconscious of a given culture through symbol. Symbols always stand for that which is not known. There is always an emotional t one attached to a symbol as well. There is a close correlation between symbol, fe eling and color. These analogies go toward building up the representational form of the arche types (thus, Artemis' color is blue, Aphrodite is associated with green, etc.). They may only be recognized through the effects that they produce upon the self. Archetypes act like instincts when they shape the conscious conte nts through motivation and modification. Neumann states, \"They are the main constituents of myt hology, they"},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"stand in an organic relationship to one another and their stage of development succession determines the growth of consciousness.\" In other words, within his \"growth fantasy\", Neumann postulates that if one can become adept at perception and cooperation with archetypes, it is \"as if\" one could consciously advance one's stage of developm ent. One may cooperate with the unconscious, and work in harmony toward the as-yet-unkn own psychic goal. Archetypes, then, can be seen as foci or lenses of the subconscious min d. Using the Tree of Life from QBL as a model of consciousness-development, certain arche types may be seen as corresponding with different stages of development. Beginning in Malkuth, the Shadow, representative of the personal uncon scious contents, is the first figure to be met and reconciled. The anima and animus are contras exual figures which often make their appearance projected onto our loved ones (Yesod) . Beyond these lie the archetypal images of 'spirit' (Hod) and 'nature' (Netzach); then , the various representations of the Self (Tiphereth) such as the magical child, h ero, wise old man or woman, etc. The images become more subtle as we penetrate the depths of the psyc he. Remember, in the developmental model, a firm foundation is built through dealing wi th the more easily- grasped images. When one image has been comprehended, its energy or libido flows into constellating the next archetype in sequence. This sequence is not f ixed, but QBL is a useful tool for study, and orderly progression. The Shadow, representing the \"unlived\" side of life, includes not onl y repressed or rejected qualities, but also the potential for creativity. One simply cannot become whole by rejecting a part of oneself. However, \"coming into a relationship with one's shadow \" can hardly be used to excuse irresponsible behavior. People who \"act-out\" their shad ow through various degrees of socially unacceptable behavior, without conscious control, may be te rmed \"possessed.\" As contasexual images, the anima and animus are often projected to member s of the opposite sex. The man's feminine side is represented by his anima. This personal form of anima is conditioned by the totality of his experience with women. A man's consciousness corresponds with the solar principle. His anima, as personification o f his unconscious, is lunar. When the anima is operating unconsciously, it can possess the man causin g him to become moody, upset, or touchy: all of the negative aspects of the eternal woman . On the positive side, the anima teaches emotion and relatedness. She is associated with soul or psyche. Anima is the carrier of consciousness in its journey into psych e in both men and women. Identification of the ego with consciousness is the product of a m ind under the influence of the hero archetype. Projections of the transcendent ani ma appear as Magna Mater, Sophia, Isis, Shakti, Virgin Mary, High Priestess, prophetess. A woman experiences the male aspect of herself through the animus. Her consciousness is characterized as lunar-feminine. Her unconscious is symbolized, not by t he sun of day, but by the 'Sol niger' (or dark sun), which is connected with the father-i mage. When possessed"},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"by the animus, a woman is bossy, inclined to make arbitrary statements, and is \" always right.\" The animus functions logically. Its activation helps the woman to organize he r thinking. Animus us representative of the spirit, or logos principle. The animus is projected into the religious sphere as master of wisdom, magician, priest, protector, teacher , etc, or experienced internally as a personified link with the woman's uncon scious. Emma Jung states, \"what a woman has to overcome in respect to the animus is not pride, b ut inertia and lack of self-confidence.\" When their contents are not projected (and their energetic charge lost ), anima and animus form a bridge between consciousness and the unconscious (represent ed in QBL as the Middle Pillar). They function as filters of the contents of the collect ive unconscious to the conscious mind. They function very effectively as long as the tendencies of t he conscious mind. They function very effectively as long as the tendencies of the consc ious and unconscious do not diverge greatly. Anima and animus should be born constant ly in mind in evaluating one's interactions. Constant observation pays the unconscious a t ribute that more or less guarantees greater harmony. The integration of the shadow, or the realization of the personal unconsciou s, marks the first stage of the \"descent\" into the depths of the psyche. Without it, a r ecognition of the anima or animus is impossible. The anima or animus is developed through a relati on to a partner of the opposite sex, generally. Only in such a relationship do the proj ections become activated and observable. There are three basic reasons why one should try to learn to use these proj ections as operatives: 1) to gain communion with one's contrasexual aspect, 2) to stren gthen the link between consciousness and the unconscious, 3) to come into real relat ionships with others, rather than relating to one's illusory image of them. The multiplicity of archetypal forms is contained or coordinated in the arc hetype of the Self. It shows an underlying unity in multiplicity. The archetype pre sides over the process of psychic transformation or the spiritual quest. Its common images are ch ild, king, or sacrificed god. It has been personified in the Christ, Holy Guardian Angel , and the higher Self. Reality is contained in many symbols. One can relate them via a system of correspondences. Seeing the signs, hidden meanings, extracting the sub jective value builds a structure. Then, we can read the message in the apparently formless fl ow of events. Archetypes bring with them a sense of destiny, a certain fatedness. They ac tivate synchronistic phenomena; they are an acausal connecting principle. Through the \"vocabulary\" of the correspondence system, one may assemble corroborating evi dence that particular archetypal patterns are at work in one's life. For instance, falli ng in love may correspond with some transit of Venus in the birthchart. The magical correspondence system allows us to consciously choose to produce a certain turn in our psychology. We use the correspondences to create the atmospher e of any given portion of the personality, and later of the individuality. The corresponden ces speak in a"},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":"language the subconscious not only understands but also responds to, willingl y. The imagination is very important in this archetypal structuring. According to Ju ng, magic is \"the first achievement wrested by primitive man from instinctual energy, through analogy- building.\" The imagination, in creating and using the correspondence system, is one of t he great pointers for Reality. It is the creative path which enables man to survive, ad apt, and progress. A magical ceremony creates working potential for relationship t o the psyche. Because of its value it exerts a determining and stimulating effect on the imagination. By taking imagination seriously, tapping into the level beyond personal fantasy, we may view the images produced and correspond them to a major archetypal pattern (usually determined by their mythical counterpart). This establishes a lin k of conscious and unconscious. Now, one may simply overlay a system or discipline which one wish es to use, to methodically assimilate some qualities of a given archetype and move beyond unconscious domination by it. The unconscious is too intimidating to encoun ter en masse. It is, however, possible to relate to a portion of it at a time. Once a particular way of looking at reality is established, it automatically sets u p limitations, or boundary conditions. However, there is great latitude if one h as the ability to subjectively choose from many such realities, without falling prey to i dentification. The whole person participates in the choice, rather than being compelled by u nconscious motivation. This description of archetypes is conditioned by the assumption of a hierarchal/developmental fantasy, which itself is one literalization of the archetype of \"The Way.\" We could have, on the other hand, examined archetypes from another perspec tive. When archetypes are seen as existing co-laterally with one another, or in const ant, co-equal relationship, the stages-of-development fantasy fades into the background. I t depends on one's conditioned point-of-view. Both viewpoints together illustrat e the psychic reality. The ability to embrace divergent points-of-view without conflict, leads to t he ability to use them both as tools. This prevents a one-sided dogmatism. The developmental model is monotheistic; it emphasizes the One God seen through many forms. The polytheistic model recognizes the sovereignty of the various god s and goddesses. It is based on relatedness, not goal-oriented development. Remember, the world appears as you are conditioned to experience it. Diffe rent archetypes can cause you to alter viewpoints dramatically. Gods affect our styles of consci ousness, and change our point of view. In conclusion, here are some things archetypes are not: 1) defined or con fined by phenomenological studies or lists of their qualities, characteristics , and correspondences; 2) they are not themselves portrayals of concepts which can be mapped out as th ings or places; 3) nor translatable into scientific terms from other discipl ines including philosophy, as they aren't empirically derived; 4) archetypes are not restricted to pr inciples or categories of therapy; 5) nor are they to be considered contents of the uncon scious,"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"something contained within something else. The sacred archetype is not separated from the profane image. None of these methods of amplification define or exhaust the possibilit ies of archetypal forces. They are means in expanding cognitive and emotional experience of the archetypal region, but the archetypes are cosmic forces spanning a broader continuum of existence than human mind or intuition can comprehend. ARCHETYPES (2) An attempt to break down the archetype's course of activity might reveal the following stages: 1. The archetype is quiescent, a structural factor in the psychoid realm of the collective unconscious, an invisible \"nuclear element\" and \"potential carrier of meaning.\" 1. Through a suitable constellation--which may be conditioned by individual or collective factor---it receives additional energy; its charge is increased, and it s dynamic operation begins. The individual constellation depends on the individual's stat e of consciousness, the collective constellation on the corresponding state of consciousness of human groups. 3. The charge of the archetype is manifested in a kind of magnetic pull on the conscious mind, which, however, is not at first recognized. It takes the form of vague emot ional activity, which may swell into violent psychic agitation. 4. Attracted by the charge, the light of consciousness falls on the archetyp e; the archetype enters the actual psychic area, it is perceived. 5. When the archetype as such is \"touched by consciousness,: it can manif est either on the \"lower\" biological plane and take form, for instance as an expression of instin ct or as an instinctual dynamism, or on the \"higher\", spiritual plane as an image or i dea.(3) In the later case the raw material of imagery and meaning are added to it, and the symbol is born. The symbolic guise in which it becomes visible varies and changes accordin g to the outward and inward circumstances of the individual and the times. The encounter with the consciousness of a collectivity and its problems gives rise to collective sym bols (e.g. mythologems); contact with an individual consciousness and its prob lems gives rise to individual symbols (as, for example, the image of a witch with the features of one's own mother). 6. The symbol acquires a certain degree of autonomy in its confrontation with the conscious mind. 7. The meaning with which the symbol is \"pregnant\" more or less compels t he conscious mind to come to terms with it. This may occur in the most diverse ways--e ither spontaneously, through contemplation, representation, interpretation, e tc. or in analysis. 8. The symbol may"},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"a) be brought closer to the conscious mind by understanding and be felt and recognized in some degree belonging to the ego, but without being wholly fathomed, so that it c ontinues to be \"alive\" and effective; b) be completely fathomed and explored.

It then becomes an autonomous splint er psyche, which can make itself felt in the form of \"spirits,\" hallucinations, etc., that is, in all kinds of neurotic symptoms. b. Mythic Correspondence (1). HERA All Homage to Hera, stately equal of Zeus. Her power and position are put to great use. Hera embodies the feminine portion of the transpersonal authority, the S elf. Inner contact with this archetype for a woman is an experience of the core of her being. To be in harmony with herself, she must serve this inner dynamism. This might be seen as a modern \"worship\" of Hera. A neurotic or under-developed man would have to come to terms with the aut horitarian aspect of the mother complex. A man involved in developing his \"femi nine\" side would serve Hera over and against the logos principle. this is generally a stage in the p sychic life of men, whose quest for the Self culminates in the Puer/Senex reuni on with masculine symbolism. Curiously like many royal couples, Hera and Zeus are both siblings and mates. Th is symbolism of brother/sister love represents the restoration of bis exual totality. The fulfillment and wholeness of Zeus and Hera consists of a dyadic relations hip. She wants to be in the presence of her beloved, because she derives her fulfillme nt through involvement. This involvement is not always pleasant. Hera is a goddess distinguished by her great antiquity. It is interestin g to note that the very first temple at Mt. Olympus was that of Hera. It dates from the second half of the 7th Century to 1000 B.C. She is also the official patroness of the Olympic Games, wh ich were started by her muscular hero, Herakles. The fact that his twelve labors w ere in service to her is shown by his name being derived from hers. Hera is, first and foremost, the wife of Zeus; if you will, wife of the Ch airman of the Board of Directors. She is as potent of a directing force as he is. But in a patriarchal society her powers tend to appear in negative forms. Managerial ability can become an urge to con trol and direct those closest at hand--the family."},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"There is a great deal of animosity directed at Zeus and his mortal and immort al paramours. This must have kept Hera pretty busy, and emotionally aroused, since the number of Zeus' liasons is legendary. But Zeus had no immunity against the ons laughts of Hera! the masculine principle, as represented by Zeus, is far from om nipotent when challenged by her powerful contrary principle. Hera is repeatedly the victim of her own powerful emotions. The volcanic qu ality of her animus (inner masculinity) is embodied in Hephaistos, her lame son. Th is product of parthenogenesis was conceived without a father, from her brooding. As such, h e came to rule volcanic activity, physical and emotional. When moody, Hera is capable of veritable explosions of strong emotions. Hera is outspoken and she has a scolding tongue. But she is not always so overt in h er attacks. Despite her moral indignation at the behavior of others, she is mo re than willing to manipulate the feelings of others to suit her own needs and desires. The Hera personality is seen in the grande dame type of woman. She is given to large sse or charitable activities. She has an aristocratic aura which assumes a right to c ommand, both activity and attention. She is born-to-order and scarcely questions this de stiny as anything other than her rightful position in life. She may express herself thr ough becoming a patron of the arts, or an administrator (for example, a Dean of Women). As the result of her strong social concerns, she pays special attention to k eeping herself attractive. She is always fashionable and publicly appropriate. She has a stron g sense of honor and duty. Many find these qualities present in First Lady, Nancy Reagan. Be fore her, the personality of Jacqueline Kennedy fascinated the nation. Hera prefers to grapple with concrete details, rather than muse on int ellectual theories or abstractions. This can be valuable in coordinating one's estate, after all, when there is much to be done. Even though she is a bit eccentric, her innate feel for s ocial awareness allows her to integrate and maintain acceptance by those of all social levels. H er mores will invariably reflect those of her surrounding culture. Hera has never been psychologically far from our thoughts, but recently she has e njoyed a graphic, and rather amusing resurgence! Hera presides over the dominion including marriage, wifehood, motherhood and--the rights of women. The increasing p olitical clout being amassed by the Equal Rights Amendment (E.R.A.) is becoming a signif icant power, even if the amendment itself remains to be added to the Constitution. It is interesting that Hera was known in past times as Era. Thus, she is t he underlying archetypal dominant of the E.R.A. All those wives and mothers proclaiming thei r equality in the paternal society are devotees of Hera. Women also seek an \"equal pay for equ al work\" situation in the job market. Working women have been severely discri minated against, and are now \"venting their spleen.\" The stories and rites surrounding Hera indicate an instinctual backgrou nd as the mating instinct. The antiquity of the goddess shows the instinctual natur e of her origin. This instinct seeks fulfillment of a particular sort which will not be su blimated to other goals. If forced to deviate from its goal, it will instead turn negative."},{"pageNumber":974,"pageContent":"The wifehood of Hera seeks as her essential mode-of-being the requi red marital union with her spouse on several levels. She is not concerned merely with his physic al fidelity, or his ability to be the father of her children. She is driven by a compulsive ne cessity to be perfected through conjugal union. She seeks a multi-level, intimate r elationship. She wants to know the ins and outs of her spouse. INSERT PICTURE HERA JUNO Hera cannot abide having a \"token spouse\" or an official husband who period ically checks in while he carries on his life elsewhere. His proximity and commitm ent to her are critical. She embodies the desire for the archetypal hierosgamos or sacred marriage which occurs between male and female on the physical, emotional, intellectual, and spir itual planes of experience. You bet, she wants to stay abreast of his business dealings. What if he should die and she needs to take charge! Hera would probably prefer to have Zeus all to h erself, if her secret wish were known. But, in time, this would no doubt prove quit e troublesome. Hera wishes to experience depth of relationship with Zeus. To her, marri age is no abstract institution. She does not wish him to assert his independence from w edlock with her. She doesn't even wish him to turn inward on his own resources. If he follo ws his own inner feminine voice and becomes too introverted, she feels thwarted in her fu lfillment. The fact is, Hera and Zeus are interdependent on one another for fulfill ment of this basic drive. This is the daily confrontation of married life, merely being in one an other's presence. Having meaningful interaction requires renewed concern f or the \"now.\" It makes marriage an arena for individuation of the partners through the mutu al give-and- take of everyday life. The sacred marriage is no final act but requires period ic renewal. This cyclic renewal is intrinsic to the Hera cult. She was symbolicall y purified and renewed her commitment to Zeus in recurrent wedding ceremonies. These multiple weddings indicate a return to the condition of uncon scious, original identity. At the time of the wedding, Zeus and Hera are truly one through the process of identification or participation mystique. But, inevitably, another crisis situation creates a critical atmosphere, but it is a necessary prelude to conscious realizati ons. And the cycle goes on... Since the state of the minds of the partners are not identical, ther e are usually differences in adjustment to marriage. Differences in tempo, and in the degree of sp iritual development are typical causes of difficulty, according to Jung. One partner is generally more psychologically complex than the other. This partner is frequently c apable of much faster personal growth, but may be erratic. The spouse who is grounded in a positive relationship to the parents can ge nerally adapt better. They are not hindered by a deep seated unconscious tie to the par ents, and are therefore more mature. A complex nature has many facets and seeks to r ealize many of them. Versatility has a certain charm, but it can mask an underlying impuls iveness. Jung thought that woman's spiritual life was contained in her relation ship to her husband. Conversely, a man is contained emotionally in his wife. This may have been the c ase in his day. However, the alternative lifestyle movement has produced many spirituall y oriented"},{"pageNumber":975,"pageContent":"persons with commitments outside the Dyad. For example, a woman devotee of a spi ritual Master obviously in not wholly contained spiritually by her husband. Likewi se, a man involved in intensive social action such as counseling, has a vigorous emotional life outside the home. These divided loyalties are actually healthier than the all-or-nothing pr oposition of having no essential obligations or binding interests outside of the marriage. Ne vertheless, the simpler spouse has the advantage of undividedness. The other spouse can en vy this condition, feeling himself outside the marriage. This can become prob lematical, as it awakens longings in him for that particular bliss. His many-facetedness may fragment creating a crisis to bring conflict to ahead. INSERT PICTURE HERA AND ZEUS He or she seeks the completion and contentedness the other seems to w allow in. When he begins to squirm, her insecurities are painfully aroused. The specte r of rivals begins to appear on the horizon. Driven inward by disappointment the spouse may beco me desperate or violent, exploding in a spasm of rage and manipulative tactics. Forced to turn in on herself, she may even be lucky enough to find an inner self sufficienc y. As the possibilities of inner integration become apparent to both sp ouses, they have the possibility of achieving the experience of an undivided self. This is a qu antum leap in consciousness...a metamorphosis. This stage cannot come without confrontati on of the anima/animus. The constant animosity depicted in the Zeus-Hera configur ation has a telos or goal. Every phase of life has its particular psychological goals as well as physical change s. One can always hope to be surprised in marriage by having one's own complexities ans wered by a corresponding diversity. But, progress may also be arrested at any stage of develop ment with no further breakthroughs. Consider the divorce rate. Individual c apacities for adjustment vary. Remember, Hera marries Zeus over and over again. You might thin k she is trying to get it right. There is much pathology associated with this archetype including traged y, yearning, jealousy, vindictiveness, and shrewishness. Hera is shrewd. This behavi or, though inherent in her nature, is motivated by the attitude and behavior of her roaming spouse Z eus. He never seems to settle down, content with the domestic routine. When h e persecutes her, through neglect of his affairs, she is distraught. She reacts so strongly t hat she becomes self-destructive. In her negative phase Hera is possessed by her animus reactions. In the myt h, she gave reactionary birth to many monster children, conceived by herself in th e lonely brooding of her rejection. She projected this rejection by Zeus into a form of her own son, Hephaistos. His birth as a separate entity means she lost the possibility of developi ng her own deeply introverted creative processes. If she could only have gotten a meaningfu l job! She winds up rejecting her son as Zeus rejected her."},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":"With Prometheus, another son, she gave birth to her rebellious opposition to t he dominion of Zeus, meaning she expelled her ability to gain in ego-consciousness. Prom etheus later has his own rebellious acts and conflicts with Zeus. The combative Ares was the embodiment of her bloodthirsty rage, her egotism , and her jealousy. Ares warlike nature is an instinct which has wreaked havoc with mankind ever since. Finally, Hera goes really psychotic and expels the monster Typhaon. As thi s reptilian beast, she bursts all fetters and runs amok. With no limit to her destruct ive capabilities, who knows what she might do. At this point, one can only hope for mitigation, not litigation. Perhaps it is ti me for another purification and transformation through a renewal of the sacred aspect of marriage. In the Argive legends, Hera was known as \"the goddess of the yoke.\" The meaning of yoga is 'yoking' or 'union'. And in this sense, marriage may be considered a yoga, and an ar ena for spiritual development. On the plus side, Hera was also Mother of the Chari tes (Faith, Hope, and Love), gaining thereby her affinity for charitable work.

The Twelve Olympians 2. Saturn/Kronos, the Puer Senex Archetype Chronos, the Ancient, SPACE/TIME in one. It is he, who chronologically devours all suns. Chronos is known as the Lord of Form and Boundaries. He was the offspring of Uranus and Rhea, archetypal grandfather and grandmother. Rhea mad a scythe and talked Chronos into using it to overthrow or emasculate Uranus. When Uranus became imp otent, Chronos liberated his siblings who procreated further. Chronos and Rh ea mated and produced Hestia Hades Demeter Poseidon Hera Zeus An oracle had predicted that Chronos would be overthrown by one of his sons s o he promptly swallowed them up. Rhea tricked him into disgorging the childre n, whereupon Zeus cast Chronos into the depths of the universe. In other words, Chronos became enchained in matter and SPACE/TIME entered phenomenal existence. Chronos' role as a Devouring Father is examined by Murray Stein in Fathers and Mothers : Kronos, whose name means \"time,\" brings in an essential aspect of ego-consc iousness. Unlike Ouranos, who is the eternal, infinite sky, Kronos underlies our perc eption of"},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"past-present-future, our orientation in time. His castration of Ouranos, t herefore, means the end of eternal blind reproduction, of purely instinctual fecundit y, age following age endlessly, driven on by unself-conscious spirit. After the cas tration of Ouranos this kind of creativity is no longer possible. Genius enters the stage of time- and self-consciousness. The castrating instrument of Kronos becomes the scythe of Father Time. ...Whereas the strategy of Ouranos is to keep his potential rivals, his childre n, unconscious through repression in materia, the strategy of Kronos is to i ncorporate them and thys to spiritualize or psychologize them, thereby severing th em from their instinctual origins. ...This act of splitting positive and negative, spiritual an d instinctual, creative and destructive is Kronos swallowing his childre n...under Kronos all the children have to be incorporated in spirit. The brooding conservatism of Chronos manifests in the psychological complex kn own as the Puer/Senex. It represents the polarities of Eternal Youth and Fath er Time. In Latin, Senex means old man, but may also be applied to an old woman who exhibits certain tr aits. We can take a small mental journey through time, analogous to the magickal operation of Rising on the Planes, where the mind moves from the physical earth-re ality out to the reaches of the universe.

Personifcation of this figure include the old wise man, elder, counse lor, hermit, priest, cripple, etc. Saturn is concerned with the Law, dry data, the cold, hard fact s. He is cynical and likes intellectual abstraction and principles of order. As ruler of Space/Time he has interests in geometry and astronomy. Saturn lies behind scientific s ystems of measurement and all hierarchical systems of philosophy and government. He oversees th e process of"},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"spiritual discipline which requires isolation and inwardness. He governs self-control and extends this mania for control to others. He provides realization through tim e and material manifestation. Saturn figures prominently in every individual's cycles of becoming. Th e end of the process of maturation and the beginning of the aging process occurs at approximately age 30, the time of 'Saturn Return,' (when Saturn returns in the natal chart to its position at birth). This cycle is linked to attitude development and cycles of structural form. In the first 28 years of life we are conditioned by parents and culture; they program th e structure of personality. In the second 28 years there is, theoretically, an individual self -expression and creative downpour until the spiritual identity crisis at 56-60, which c reates the transformed cultural identity of spiritual power and self-realization. Important in this timing process are fate and genetic patterns. Saturn rules habit, counting and remembering. There is a relationship be tween the Senex and a disease characteristic of old age, senility. Vasopressin is the remed y normally prescribed in these cases; it is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gl and which actually restores damage done to nerve connections in the brain. Another important component in the memory process is the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Both of th ese are produced less as the body ages. Saturn is the personification of the alchemical operation known as coagulati o. This process was considered as making things stick and hold together, so that they becam e more solid, dense, and immobile. We find this image occurring in the aging process where it is known as cross-linkage in protein and connective tissue. During youth, there is a m oderate amount of cross-linkage tying the connective tissue together so it is quite elas tic. With increased age, the cross links are formed, the tissue hardens, and movement becomes r estricted or painful. Chronos reminds us that we are \"running out of time\" by bringing an om nipresent awareness of death, (GRIM REAPER). It is not surprising that among the fascinations of Chronos are time managem ent programs and longevity or life extension programs. In fact, he has a program to manage or organize just about every facet of life. Chronos appears as both profane (clocktime) and sacred time. Saturn unfolds manifestations of all the gods (disgorges his children) wh en sacred time appears as the multiple recurrence of archetypal patterns, (Chronic r eappearance). A primary manifestation of Chronos is his tendency to depressive brood ing and philosophical pessimism. He can't escape the tendency to thoroughly d issect and examine his own thoughts and feelings, and actions. This torments him. He is aust ere, and blocks the spontaneous out-flowing of the will. In other words, his influence is to in hibit. He is a workaholic and tries to block the urge toward transformation in his offsprin g. He experiences guilt, separation, and stagnation until he unites with his opposite, the Puer, and becomes the unified symbol of the Self. The generation gap occurs because both the puer and senex project their sh adows upon each other. They see in one another's mode of consciousness all those things which are anathema. Actually, the ideal lies in a balanced combination of these style s of awareness and values. This union is shown in the Tarot by the fact that there is the af finity of"},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"Beginning and End in the cards O, The Fool and XXI, The Universe, which re present the puer and senex, respectively. In the Diamond-Body model of the Self these t wo paths are congruent at the nexus or center of the causal body. Saturn governs exits (like death) and entries; he therefore rules the process of initiation. Path 32, The Uni verse is the first stage of pathworking up the Tree of Life, beginning in Malkuth. We are all, in a sense, prisoners in time and phenomenal existence. Saturn ru led over prisons and prisoners...he is the archetypal warden of the realm of form. The p risoners pay homage to Saturn by \"doing time,\" or \"serving time.\" Other clichés show the c lose affinity between money and time, such as \"time is money,\" and \"spending time.\" Chronos has a relationship to ENTROPY. The Senex/Puer complex is the ps ychological manifestation of the Order/Disorder paradox. No wonder the senex is so fanati cal about order: it is his radical form of self-defense: The ego has been forged in an aspect of \"profane time\"; it has emerged through history as an ongoing process. The ego has related to this history with directed thinking, which cannot and must not be discarded. If sublimation is truly to m ediate the order-disorder paradox, then a full experience of \"profane time\" is required, els e entropy and disorder will not be truly included. Thus \"directed thinking\" m ust be rounded with \"primitive thinking\" to aid the constellation of the middle pat h. Because the ego has a \"linear segment\" of irreversible time in its orderin g acts, it inevitably will experience disorder.

This is a depressive phase at the beginn ing of the process. There is value and meaning in depression; it is necessary to rel ate to the senex; it slows down the puer impulsiveness. When we are overextended, the sen ex make us turn within to renew our resources. One reconnects to the well-spring of being, connecting with the deeper values of the Self. Failure to connect to introversion and entangl ement in life commitments can lead to nervous collapse.

(7) Of course, no one likes to be \"depressed to death.\" There are suicides w ho do not make it through this dry wilderness of the psyche. James Hillman has proposed a solu tion to this problem in \"The Negative Senex and a Renaissance Solution.\" Consider that ord er itself is a form of madness, which contains its own inherent possibility of transc ending its \"excessive tension\" or stress. This unique solution comes through time from the past and resolves a question of how to resolve the struggle with the negative senex in ou rselves and our culture. A history of Ficino in relation to the psyche of the Renaissance is yet to be w ritten. Nevertheless we cannot refrain from drawing lessons from the moveme nt in his psyche. He arrived at the place where transmuting melancholy comes abut through communication with one's genius in its depressive weakness, through its woundedness. The orientation of this movement was generally governed by avid intellect ual curiosity, by imaginal contemplation mainly in terms of the classical ideas and Gods, and by a particular devotion to Eros and to soul. The net which held his ideas was Neoplatonic, that is, his personal survival depended upon the Platonist fantasy of the psyche. T his fantasy and these dominant themes which it interwove are also propensities of puer phenomenology. (8) There are many modern examples of the Senex personality from right-wing R epublican Ronald Reagan, the Ayatollah Khoumeni with his religious fanaticism, etc. Exam ples of the transformed Senex are harder to find. The spiritual father of the Surat S habd Yoga sect, in India is an example. His name is Charan Singh, and he is considered God-Reali zed. He is a Param Sant Sat Guru, which means he is the highest kind of Saint, a Perf ect Living Master, and a Teacher as well. He teaches a conservative, ethical philosophy; b ut this yogic path of the union of the soul and the sound current (the Word) liberate s one from the karmic wheel of birth and death.

(2) INSERT PICTURE TRACTATUS PRIMI b. SATURN, Lord of Boundaries and the Status Quo The main planetary power of Saturn is maintenance of the status quo, includ ing prevailing cultural attitudes. Saturn is toe personification of senex consciousnes s, which exaults in a rigid view of the superiority of wisdom and lengthy experience. Saturn is a slow-moving planet, so its effects characterize specific gro ups of people, depending on which sign Saturn occupied at their birth. Saturn refl ects the concerns of specific groups, and reflects the attitude an individual has toward soc iety and cultural norms. Saturn points up our areas of limitation, and inertia. No one individual c an embody all of existence, or expand indefinitely. By setting boundaries or limits on potential, Saturn functions allow the manifestation of events and forms. Saturn sets rul es, and defines structures. Saturn is not one of the fast-travelling personal planets. It extroverts the at tention towards others. It manifests in feelings of duty, responsibility, and \"correct ness\". For example, in working dutifully at one's job, one fits in successfully in society, and mai ntains a reputation as socially acceptable. However, Saturn also holds us back, keeping dreams unf ulfilled, and creating frustration. Some people learn life's lessons in this way, yet othe rs continue to \"buck the system.\" When an individual conflicts with consensus realit y, he is sure to experience turmoil, depression, and anxiety."},{"pageNumber":987,"pageContent":"Saturn works with an automatic quality: \"What goes around comes around.\" Our collective society is a consciousness which guides and chastises an individual into doing his \"Karma Yoga\", or fulfilling the destiny created for oneself. Karma Yoga is a course of action requiring the sublimation of one's behavior. It is a purging of gross d esires, and exalts the concept of selfless service to mankind as the highest ideal. To be a liberating path, Karma Yoga requires three things: 1). True knowledge of correct values, or not equating reality with Truth. 2). Respect for all forms of life. 3). A ctively willed behavior, unbiased by fear of punishment or desire of reward. Lived rightly, it is actionless-action in a selfless devotion to duty. Saturn helps us create our individual perspective on reality. It infl uences our \"worldview.\" Even though we might understand intellectually that all is in constant flux, we could not operate effectively in that mode. Therefore, our mind creates a reality sys tem, which is pragmatic and functionally efficient in its structure. The rigidity w ith which we adhere to our idiosyncratic realities determines our limitations, and raises conf licts with others who use different paradigms. The differences may be socially or culturally i nspired, and create warring factions. The aging process is governed by Saturn, since it represents actualization of more and more of one's potential. It presides over lingering death and chronic illn ess. At its worst, senex consciousness destroys spontaneity, obsessed by its repetitive di sciplines into a narrowness of emotions, mental processes, and activities. Robert Hand summarizes the core meaning of Saturn: Reality as culturally defined; relationship to groups, consensus. Reality as structure and limitation; rules, the consequences of error. Too much actualized and too li ttle potential left; aging, death. The father; learning a discipline, growing into a soci al role, learning the rules; schools, teachers, guides, bosses. Areas of life that n eed work. The limits of what can be perceived by the ordinary mind. (1) Saturn also rules crises situations of life. These can bring realization s one's inner life. Wholeness in its psychological sense is found through personal encounter s with the dictates of external circumstances. Pain, frustration, and leaden depression can ed ucate one, leading to discovery of one's self. Life's delays and disappointments cr eate a \"ripening\" process in the soul. The experience of Saturn comes in normal, wake-a-day consciousness; it is n ot an alternate mode, since it denies the cultural validity of \"alternate states\". It can not appreciate them, lacking the experience, and denies their value as a valid perspective. Sat urn uses only logical thought which provides the basis of reality. Saturn represents the \"mentalized cravings\" of the causal level. It is al so termed \"lust of result\" and prevents transformations through binding of one's energies . There is a relationship between desires, attachments, and fate (or Karma). The powe rs of the instincts must be transformed. Conflict between the conscious and unconscious a ttitudes and goals must be harmonized."},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"Fighting against oneself is a self-destructive mode, creating guilt, fut ility, and endless pain and fear. However, by working oneself through this seemingly purposeless activity, one gains a new perspective on reality. In terms of QBL, consciousness rises f rom Malkuth to Yesod, along the Path of the Universe, XXI. Through this means, suffering bec omes a meaningful path, \"evil\" is transmuted into a greater good: the individual un foldment of the path to the Self. In ancient times, when men relied on unaided vision, the orbit of Satur n marked the limits of mankind's Universe; thus, they were synonymous. Today, our conceptual lim its are expanded, but Saturn still governs in the same qualitative manner. We are still bound by the Lord of Time/Space and ego-consciousness. c. The Nigredo in Alchemy The Nigredo represents the rotting stench of decay from the ego's outmode d attitudes and lack of adaptability. It occurs at the time in the life of the aspirant w hen the strain of the environment has become intolerable. In time, the attacked alchemist c omes to realize that he must willingly subject himself to change. Raven's head is the traditional name for the stage of the process whose techn ical name is the Nigredo. The Nigredo is symbolized by multiple references to black s ubstances, and is associated with the Shadow archetype, or repressed contents of the pers onal unconscious. The Nigredo implied a time of melancholia, sleeplessness, and restles s volatility. This stage of discomfort with the status quo is quite necessary to initiate the alch emical process. There is an inherent value and meaning in this depression. Psychologically, one experiences a chaotic state of conflict between hosti le psychic elements. There is a tendency toward regression, or losing consciousness of the moti vating factors of behavior. Any emotional response to the situation is practically impossible . In modern terms, it is equivalent to the concept of psychic dissociation, which is the root of neurosis and psychosis (\"falling apart\"). There is always psychic suffering when you \"fall\" down. This suffer ing may even persist for a lifetime if there is a technical blunder in The Work (Opus). Th e alchemist must \"pick himself back up.\" Then, there will be further transmutations from the instinctive psyche. This stage corresponds to the encounter with the Shadow. The ego and the S hadow must eventually be reconciled. The restlessness and disorientation are th e product of an initial collision between conscious and unconscious factors. This is the be ginning of a descent into darkness, or the unconscious. As long as psyche struggles in the Nigredo, it will be emotionally attached to th e literal aspects of any situation. Fascinated by \"facts\" and the \"materialness\" of an y condition, the alchemist fails to extract the symbolic aspect which would allow him to break through into a fresh mode of perception. Typical manifestations of this stage include lon g dreams, confusions, and a drained or depressed mental attitude. The symbolic attitude is preserved when the Nigredo is perceived as part of a mystery process."},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"Missing the point, the eye of the aspirant caught up in the Nigredo looks for wh at is \"wrong.\" It ruminates on such physical questions as, Is it an organic or neu rological problem creating these manifestations of depression in me? It will then propose such treatments as pills, body work, or dance therapy. Grossness casts a veil or cloak of physicality over the subtle body of the alchemist and he fails to realize it i s his soul which is sick unto death. The \"cure\" will not come through vitamin therapy, or reju venating drugs, or exercise. The élan vital, or life energy has been pulled into the unconscious, leaving th e ego frustrated and discontent. The emptiness and sterility of this condi tion may be the result of placing too much emphasis on \"getting it together\" in the work-a-day world, le aving the soul cut off from the well-springs of life. The feeling of being drained , or over-extended may become so powerful that one is forced into a breakdown which demands the time for introversion and recovery of energy reserves. INSERT PICTURE The ability to see through to a value in depression (to experience the mean ingfulness of the feeling of meaninglessness) has a prognosticative purpose. Attaching meanin g to depression allows an emotional participation which unblocks the flow of psychic en ergy. Depression is not a loss of meaning, but the feeling of loss of a sense of meaning. This is actuall y the beginning point of the quest, as illustrated by such stories as Dante's Inferno , Rider Haggard's SHE , and Melville's Moby Dick . If one can see that the world is beautiful, but has lost the ability to feel that beauty, there are mood swings from sullen inertia to active despair. There is a sense of fragmentation and alienation from one's self. This is a major reason individuals seek psych ological analysis, or a mystical path of renewal. This whole experience is like a journey through the wilderness and it ofte n appears in dreams under the symbol of the \"Night-sea Journey.\" But when the problems of the personal unconscious have been met and dealt with in analysis, a sense of inn er unity and renewal is usually found. This is often accompanied by glimpses of deeper valu es, of the Self, for instance, that are frequently couched in the terms of reli gious symbolism. The analysant feels that he is once again reconciled with himse lf and with God so he can go back to his ordinary life with renewed zest. The wilderness is no longer barren, his life blossoms and bears fruit . (3) Path 32, connecting Malkuth with Yesod, the Sphere of the Moon, can be the pat h of renewal which transmutes the alchemist from his sense of confusion and despair. Following this state of darkness, the alchemists report that light begins to dawn, due to the rising moon, which psychologically means the beginning of insight gain ed through paying attention to the unconscious, to the night happenings, to dreams and so on, which throw a light on one's inner condition. The moon also refers to Eros, re latedness through feeling. In other words, when the nigredo, the blackness, has been accepted and taken to oneself, instead of being blamed on outside situations and other people, one begins to see that it is one's own withdrawal and loss of feeling one's own sh adow, that is the true cause of the darkness. Then the moon rises and in recognizin g that one"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"is suffering, not just a personal ill, but is participation in a human experie nce common to all mankind, feeling returns, feeling and compassion for the plight of one's fellows. That is the feminine eros; the lesser light begins to shine in the dar kness of the night . (4) Further alchemical transmutation will bring one into the warmth of t he sun, the greater light, which means there is an increase in the light of consciousness (T iphareth stage). And so one meaning of the experience of depression is that our wholeness, or individuation, the Self, can no longer wait while we follow egotistic ways or e ven seek for legitimate ego fulfillment, and so the Self brings us, drives us, into th e wilderness of depression...and communication between earth and heaven is even then about to be revealed to us, if only we will attend to the vision. (5) INSERT PICTURE 4. ORIENTATION/EXERCISE a. Time Perception and Sensory Filtering, (Philo St one, 1983) The search for a higher reality has always been a major preoccupation of man. Throu ghout the ages, he has realized that his intellect, working through the senses, w as unreliable. Either the senses reported inaccurately, or the intellect interpr eted incorrectly. Or both. Certainly the emotions and associated brain chemistry biased our reaction s. We are convinced that there must be some means of perceiving that which is reliable and eternal. The search for a freedom from illusion has taken many forms. Amongst the man y pathways we consider two dominate categories: science and religion. The t radition of science maintains that the intellectual evaluation of sensory data is a pr oper, if not the only means of viewing the universe and grasping reality. The intellect needs to b e guided by dependable tools (i.e.. mathematics), the senses must be refined and e xpanded by physical equipment (detectors and instrumentation), and that the subject ive interference (emotional bias) needs to be eliminated by proper methodology and reproducibility (s cientific method and statistics). The tradition of religion denies the value of the ordinary sensory modes and considers the intellect as a very limited part of the human potential. Instead, reality is t o be approached by a supersensory perception induced by faith or ritual, or some rigorous discipline of the physical and mental being. As opposed to science, religion uses words, musi c, meditation, physical postures, symbolic ritual, deep emotions, devoted action, and so on, as the legitimate means of bringing the individual to self-realization. The t wo traditions reached their widest schism during the last two centuries when science d eveloped general Laws and Theories which contradicted the teachings of a number of long establis hed religions. What is driving this change in the traditions of the \"search\"? Above all it i s the threat to survival with which we are faced with rapidly increasing severity. Not surprising, we reject the science which mistakenly promised salvation by technology. It gave us, ins tead, the"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"means of extinction, either by attrition (environmental pollution, weake ning agricultural balance, reduction of the human being into a statistic). We also reject the religion whose past Messiahs seem to have left us to our doom , whose promised future Saviors are too long in coming. Most practices are dusty with age , without vitality or applicability to modern conditions. Simultaneously, more subt le forces are at work. In recent years, science has begun to recognize that the biological organism is capable of numerous perceptual modes beyond the limits implied by classical fi ve sense organs. For example, there is also another sensory-motor input in the 0.3-3.0 GHz region (mi crowave). It can overlay information directly onto the brain, with out going through any other sense. Several reports demonstrate that the terrestrial geomagnetic, solar-ion ic, and cosmic energy fields are also primary in importance, transmitting information to th e organism regarding its preferred behavior. Scientific journals, devoting their pages to traditional scientific r eports, now often include the verified observations of extra-sensory information transfer (such as t elepathy, clairvoyance, ESP and magnetic energy transfer). It appears that the biologica l sensory apparatus is, in fact, normally capable of detecting all that the sophisticat ed equipments do when the information is within the energy levels of environmental condit ions. Further, our sensory abilities may be developed beyond this point by rigorous training, muc h like we would to develop any above-average performance. The implication is that the sup ersensory perception which religions strive to offer, is also something science is just beginning to measure and verify. A movement in religion (and mysticism) is beginning to break through the barrier of conservative non-adaptation. The original teachings of nearly every religion have su ddenly become available. The disenchanted may now turn eclectic, free to devel op in accordance with current conditions. Since our immediate environment is almost un iversally technological, the past religious traditions are seemingly pitted against th e machinery of science. The efficacy of religious disciplines and the validity of \"tr uths\" arrived at by mystical experience are now being confirmed or denied by modern scien tific technique. In some cases, we even find new means of bringing about the \"religious experie nce\" through modern chemistry, electronics, and psycho-therapy. A new field of study, formed by the synthesis of these two traditions, is coming back into existence. It is an approach to contacting reality, utilizing major characteri stics of both religion and science. Religion works with the essence of being, our awar eness, our consciousness, the temporal development of man. Science, on the other han d, works with physical, supposedly non-conscious, forces and learns to manipulate th ese physically, with the aid of the intellect. Science works with the spatio-energetic d evelopment of man. These forces permeate our conscious and unconscious being. They are not a s eparate, non- conscious field, but rather an expression of the consciousness that is e vident in life. We also find that our universe cannot be dimensionally divided, but that all aspe cts are integrated into experience of being. The temporal, spatial, and energetic development of man is the continuity of a singular development of the cosmos. From this realization c omes the \"art\""},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"of manipulating the conscious forces at will; the synthesis of scientif ic manipulation and religious experience of consciousness transformation. This field of study, which is truly an art-form, has been known in its former incarnations as Magic, Sorcery, and Alchemy. It has recently been termed noetics, yoga science , and parapsychology. The major point of integration between science and religion is sensory f iltering; what we perceive, the how and why. The point of departure for crystallizing the synthesis into a viable, tangible form is temporal definition and time perception. Time is the most neglected concept in human nature. Science has mostly shied away from any direct conf rontation of the role of time in mans assault on reality, being satisfied to use an accurate rhythmic instrument as the ultimate measure of the varied experience of time. Religion has never before been called upon to enunciate its temporal awar eness, its findings remain shrouded in formless intuition. The individual and social de finitions, conceptions, and perceptions of time determines the sensory filtering and thus, a lso, the nature of the experience. Our recent temporal philosophy has been conductive to a p erceptual mode and state of consciousness which is not in harmony with nature, and this realit y. It filters out subtle and important information which we now classify as extra- or super- sensory. A temporal philosophy and accompanying methodology is now available, to bring harm ony to our perceptual mode and widen its horizons to include, as normal, the e xtra- and super- sensory information. A myriad of sensory information enters our sensory apparatus at the peripher y. Only a small fraction of the data comes to us as conscious awareness of the world. Be tween the periphery and the brain, and between brain and mind, there are filter s which reduce huge portions of sense input to background (white noise), leaving a foreground wh ich is the minimum needed for survival. Recent experiments with developing ki ttens sheds light on the matter. The kittens were raised under one of three conditions. T his first was a normal control situation, the second in an environment with only vertical visual st imuli, and the third was an environment of only horizontal visual stimuli. It was found th at unlike the normal kittens, the kittens horizontally-trained were unable to perce ive vertical objects. They would walk into chair legs, for example. The kittens vertically-trai ned were unable to perceive horizontal objects. They would never jump up onto a chair seat. A detailed study of the neurological structure indicated that the kit tens raised in a limited environment did not develop the synaptic pathways necessary for conveying the u sual sense data. Thus, while the eyes worked normally, from the retina to the visual cen ter there was an unbridged gap. Furthermore, this environmental restriction led to pe rceptual blocks when applied for only a few days during a critical period of development. B ecause the neural structure in humans is more complex, we expect a more readily ad aptive mechanism to be in play. There is no doubt, however, that we perceive the world in the way we are conditioned. The sensory apparatus not only conveys information, they also filter it. Classical examples of sensory filtering include the blocking of backgro und music during an interesting conversation, the sqeek of a noisy windshield wiper, and ge stalt pictures which contain two or more scenes that the mind can see at one time, depending on sp ecific details"},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":"to determine which picture becomes foreground and which becomes b ackground. Any set of details could theoretically become foreground but we only become awar e of those foregrounds that have some familiarity of form. A mother wakes to her baby's cry, wh ile sleeping through other sounds of equal or greater volume. These are the gr oss expressions of the sensory filtering. There are more subtle situations, particularly those regarding symbols, id eas, concepts, and interpretations where sensory filtering becomes important in ones sense of self and others (in the personal and social interaction), in ones approach to life accor ding to that which is deemed possible and impossible. There is a closed circle i n which our culture conditions our filters and our filters then effect our understand ing of the world. This the determines the development of the culture. Total stagnation is only ward ed off by some unknown mechanism. It is somehow attuned to the fact that we must contin ue to perceive new and unexpected developments for the purpose of survival. According to anthropological findings, early man lived in a world of Magic. The tre nd is cyclic and in going back to a perceptual and philosophic state of being, the con trol of conscious forces by man becomes paramount. That barrier may be seen as our t emporal consciousness. During the past two centuries we have come to rely upon th e clock and calendar as measures of time, dictators of a mundane reality. Where the ancien ts used astronomical indicators as tools to guide them, we have come to be ruled by thes e tools. We have lost freedom through the misguided enthusiasm for the success of s cience. Our language still permits non-linear time concepts. Examples are tim e flies, or stands still, I don't have the time, could you spare some time, and so on. Our culture is unre mitting in forcing conceptualizations of clock time as the only real time. Thus we oft en find that there are two kinds of time discussed; objective, physical, measurable, real, cl ock time; and subjective, mental, imaginary, sensory time. The former, being the real thi ng, manages to give some ultimate importance to the time units of seconds, minutes, and h ours. This totally conquers the multi-leveled biological and geophysical clocktime rhyth ms. real time, as a measurable, in accordance with its scientific formulation, makes for a frozen past and an untouchable future. For in the same manner, the calendar and clock are al lowed to dictate the possibility of perceiving or not perceiving certain events. All this in return for accurately predicting physical events and producing an apparently viable tec hnology. Consider the difference between a culture which counts time by th e second and another, such as the Hopi Indian, while smallest time unit is the length of tim e required to boil rice. And the Buddhist, who knows that he has lived, will continue to live f or as many lifetimes as \"the number of times a bird carrying a silk kerchief would have to fly over the top of a mountain, to wear the mountain away by the friction of the cloth\". What would be th e foreground in each case, where would the focus of attention be? How would one s tructure a society with each of those time units in mind? Consider the differen ce in mental states of each person working with those temporal indicators. An American may rej ect an endeavor as \"too long\" were it to take six hours. The Hopi might find a three-week (725 ric e boilings, or 3/4 moons) project minor. And, the Buddhist is already considering the ef fects of his activities on his next lifetime. This shows up in our relative spirit ual depth, our quality of interaction with the environment, the presentation of man in the arts ."},{"pageNumber":994,"pageContent":"In Tibet, time is also measured in sixty years cycles, and this year is also zer o, calendars being measured in years from now. Thus historical events occur within cyc les and fade with age. This is to be compared with our conceptualization which keeps ti me moving linearly and away from the origin. The effect on our sensory perception of such temporal conceptions is re flected in the various approaches to reality by these different cultures. The basic unit of time relates to our calmness or hyperactivity. Cultures which have come to live by the Eur opean clock become nervous overproducers. Individuals who leave the bonds of society gai n relaxation and depth (hence the value of the vacation away from the clock). The things we perceive are related to survival in those conditions. In a m odern technologic society our perceptions center about measurable, physical entities, or n umerically and analytically regarded abstractions. INSERT PICTURE Quality is exchanged for quantity and frequency. Depth is exchanged for ph ysical presence. Success is measured in terms of how much, how many, how often, how large, how fast ...the gross attributes. The bigger the better. In societies outside the clock-driven group, time is an expression of con sciousness. Success is measured in subtle variations: The power of a single word, the beauty of a d elicate and organic design, the meaning of a gesture, the fineness of detail. These are t he extension beyond the temporal limits of the physical self. The foreground is the su btle but pervading pattern that is life. We are in the temporal compression-chamber of the world's population /technology explosion. Our essential being, instead of extending through eternity, is s ean as existing ephemerally. The present exists somewhere between the second just past and the second about to be ticked off. But this is a perceptual illusion. One is amazed to f ind that even today, with all the claims advanced by science, the organic being is rarely treate d as a rhythmic, pulsing entity with its vibrations extending out infinitely t hrough all directions of space and time. When a doctor determines your state of physical health, it is a moments look at a harmonious orchestration of rhythms which will yield different resu lts if studied again two hours later. The fact is, that the clock may indicate points of your multidim ensional vibration, but you are not that point. Only your awareness is focused on that point an d you are the integration of all the vibrations extending through time.

Man's body temperature, blood pressure, respir ation, pulse rate, blood sugar, hemoglobin and amino acid levels vary on a daily basis. The level of adrenal hormones and concentrations of bio-chemicals in the nervous system also vary on a d aily basis. Women are especially subject to monthly cycles of hormones which influen ce not only physiology but emotions, performance and dreaming as well. Seasonal changes occur in hormones, blood sugar and other important bodily functions. Annual cycles in calcium metabolism halve been verified in humans. When we are healthy, these multi ple cycles are well integrated and the result is a relatively stable system. These int egrated cycles act as time keepers for our variations in energy, emotion, thought, dreams, and attitud es. Our subjective awareness of time begins before language develops. Small babi es show rhythmic behavior in the crib. Up to age nine, time seems to be expanded and ch anging slowly. Children do not have the ability to order events and classify them as adu lts do. Physiological rate could influence our perception of time and duration. Metabolic changes might alter time awareness. Temperature changes have been shown to alter t ime estimation. There are many factors which must influence our awareness of time. Biologically, time is determined by external factors such as the rotation of t he earth, the orbiting of the moon and the seasons of the sun. Internal factors include cyc lic systems of various blood chemicals and tissue groups. There must be internal and ext ernal sensors that connect us to biological time, inherent biological clocks. The oscillati ng internal systems are usually synchronized to a high degree and thus provide a biological ti me base which is tuned to the changing external cycles of the astronomical clock s. Age is an important factor in setting the rate of the biological rhythms and influen cing time experience. Subjective Time Great confusion has resulted from considering time experience as a sens ory process. An \"organ\" of time perception has been the object of much research. Such an organ could register any of several internal processes as the basis of time sensation. Th e problem with a sensory process model is that there are so many different biological cloc ks and astronomical clocks which are so closely interlocked that no single \"clo ck\" could emerge to be the \"time keeper.\" A better model is the \"input register\" cognitive theory. This theory hol ds that the experience of a brief interval is based upon the amount of information proce ssed in that interval. This theory works well for the brief interval but encounter s problems when longer durations are considered. A related cognitive information left in storage f ollowing the interval. Thus experiences of duration need only be related to other durat ion experiences and not derived from any \"clock\", internal or external. INSERT PICTURE"},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"Duration experience is dependent upon the amount of information proce ssed and the manner in which that information is coded and stored. Brain specialists s ay that much of the cognitive power of the human brain lies in its ability to code and re-enc ode its own contents. Theoreticians in the information field speak about the possib ility of refining codes until they reach a limit. At that limit, an optimal code is found that perm its the processing of an infinite amount of information in an instant. The subjective experien ce of such an optimal coding would be of time standing still as understanding expanded t o total comprehension. The mystics refer to this condition as \"Realization.\" Further research has shown that the manner in which information is pas sed, coded and stored is critical for duration experience. If an experience can be easil y broken into chunks with familiar labels, that experience appears to be short. If experienc e is novel, then it can't be easily and simply coded and it seems to be longer. Routine activities such as driving to work are difficult to recall because the code is established in terms of a few broad categories such as \"starting the car\", \"driving downtown\", and \"parking\". On t he other hand, if an accident occurs on the way, the novelty forces the use of an unfamili ar code which makes the experience seem much longer than it actually was. The possibility also exists for recording an experience after the fact. Following the acciden t, the interval could be recorded under the new label of just \"the accident\" so that as ti me passes, that experience seems to shrink in memory. The storage size and coding theor y can cover the widest range of experimental data and for the time being looks like the best explanation of duration experience and its many facets. On the subjective level, time is determined by our expectations, mem ories and our familiar patterns of thought. Our conceptual framework determines how we categori ze experience, both immediately and in memory, and this determines our experience of du ration. This over-laps the non-conceptual influences of the many internal biological rh ythms and the external astronomical cycles. Conceptual sophistication is a function of age and education, both of which will play a large role in shaping duration experience. Personality and Time Personality exerts influence on the personal experience of time. Emoti onal people (FEELING TYPE) see time as continuous and circular because the pre sent evokes the past which gives meaning to the present. The present is always being compare d to past events so that the emotional content will be revealed. The length of an experience i s less important than the intensity of the emotion connected with the experience. In gen eral, time is less important to emotional people than emotion. Intellectual individuals (THINKING TYPE) also see time as contin uous, but linear rather than circular. The past gives rise to the present which in turn gives bi rth to the future in orderly succession. The present is always being tested against the ongoing p rocess to insure orderly evolution. The significance of an experience in terms of developmen tal patterns is more important than the length or the emotional content. In general, time is less important than orderly processes and clear principles of behavior. The orderly flow of time is more important than past, present, or future."},{"pageNumber":997,"pageContent":"People who are primarily oriented toward the senses (SENSATION TYPE) see time as discontinuous and momentary as the march of events pass, each independ ent and complete in itself. The moment arises and having been experienced is replace d by a new fresh moment to be experienced. Each moment is weighed for its content in t erms of concrete physical reality and physical activity. The importance of each moment depen ds upon the intensity of sensation and action as well as the gratification achieved. Dur ation is not experienced as such by the sensory types. Time is less important than the intensity of immediate experience. Past and future are unimportant when compared t o the present. Intuitive individuals (INTUITIVE TYPES) also see time as discont inuous but experience possibilities as being more real than the present moment. The futur e is glimpsed and then the present is manipulated toward that vision. The present is evaluat ed in terms of its importance in the realization of a particular future. The importance of an exp erience lies in the possibilities which are suggested and/or fulfilled by it. Time is less important than inspiration and bright visions of possible futures. The future is m ore important than the past or present. There is a natural progression through this system of psychotypes which is a f unction of age and personal maturity. Very young children tend to be sensual in orientati on and concern themselves with the present. Adolescents exercise thei r intuition and enjoy bright visions of interesting futures. Mature adults are expected to be balance d in their time perspective and to use hindsight as well as foresight in order to carry ou t necessary plans and processes. Old people are usually oriented toward the past and emotion al in their involvement with traditions and memories. A few individuals do not follow this development. A great deal of conflict between different age groups can be t raced back to these differences in time perspective and psychotype. Hypnosis and Time Experiments Experiments with hypnotism have revealed some interesting aspects o f personal time dilation and contraction. The past, present, and future were each expanded and contracted by hypnotic suggestion. When the past was eliminated, the subject became c onfused and irritable. There was a loss of inhibition and a loss of differentiation of me aning. Time estimates were shorter than actual clock time. When the past was expanded , the subject reported being happy. He became single minded about his interests a nd was abrupt and difficult when disturbed. When the present was eliminated, the subject lapsed into a rigid tranc e. He would not respond to stimuli. He later reported being aware but unable to respond to an ything. He said that it was very unpleasant and seemed as if he were dead. When the pre sent was expanded, the subject experienced a mood of great luminosity. He became very i nterested in lines and his problems became less important. When the future was eliminated, the subject entered a euphoric, semi -mystical state. Everything seemed to occupy a boundless present. He was free of any anxiety and spent his time savoring his immediate experiences. He was very interested in colors and textures. When the future was expanded, the subject experienced aa happy, mystical c ondition. He"},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"felt that he had plenty of time to do everything. Deadlines became unimp ortant and he said that death just became the end of life and was no longer an event to be fear ed. When both past and future were eliminated, the subject entered into a trance state very similar to the no-present condition. He later reported the feeling of b eing a machine, unable to feel and respond. Simultaneous expansion of past and future caused the su bject to become very introspective and review his past and future direction. He said that he felt more like a philosopher than he ever had. When both the past and present were expanded, the subject entered a happ y state. He became intensely interested in the origin and developmental histor y of things. Expansion of present and future caused another happy, mystical condition. He said that by i ntegrating present and future, he had triumphed over death. He became restless and hyperactive and began to play practical jokes and became very infantile. These hypnosis experiments illustrate the importance of our attitud es and beliefs toward time. The past, present and future seem to co-exist in our minds and ou r attitudes about each influence our experience of time and life in general at a particular moment. The hypnosis can be seen as simulation of critical events which alter our bel iefs and attitudes. A profound challenge toward our past beliefs or our view of future potential could have the effect of contracting the past or future. A sudden realization about the pas t or a bright new vision of the future could have an expansion effect. In general, critical events can expand or contract the past, present and/or the future to produce profound alterations in a person's attitudes and general behavior. T he critical process of aging will automatically expand and contract the past and future. Th e young have small pasts and large futures, the mature have a balance and the old have lar ge pasts and small futures. This fact may help account for the general behavioral diff erences among age groups. INSERT PICTURE c. Life Extension Practices (Aging, Rejuvenation, a nd Immortality) In our youth-oriented culture, \"old age\" is approached with trepidation, an d staved off with heroic attempts at maintaining physical fitness. The anxiety and st ress of daily living gradually convert into attitudes of depression and despair over waning physic al and mental abilities. The very powerful cultural group between the ages of fifty-five and seventy i s not only healthier, but more affluent and better educated than any comparable group in the past. The field of Geriatrics has responded to the need of this group for im proved quality of life. Since aging begins with the Saturn Return at approximately age 30, the benef its of this research are useful to the general populace. Legends of the Fountain of Youth, Immortality, Alchemy and modern Geriatric s have a common denominator: the quest for longevity. Longevity has various implication s in the four planes of existence. These include 1) spiritual immortality of the soul after physical death, 2) maintenance of mental acuity and learning ability, 3) fantasies of ete rnal youth"},{"pageNumber":999,"pageContent":"and their emotional content, and 4) a high degree of physical fitness throughou t a long lifespan. 1. Spiritual Immortality, in Alchemy, is the result of the rejuvenating e ffects of the Elixir. This Elixir is most often described in old alchemical texts as an herbo -metallic preparation. Many of them speak of various forms of preparations containing Mercury. It is diff icult to see how these could have any salutary effect, considering Mercury's poison ous capability. The actual rejuvenation effects of the Elixir were more likely psychol ogical effects resulting from the production of the Philosopher's Stone. This Stone is the alchem ical symbol for contact with the higher Self, one's wholeness. The Self archetype br ings its characteristic sense of the overcoming or transcending of the limitations of time. The E lixir is the flow of transpersonal energies into the personal life, revitalizing the entire being. The Elixir is the liquid form of the Philosopher's Stone. For an interesting insight into the birth of herbal medicine, imagine th e old crones and wizened men who combed the forests and glenns. These oldsters were be yond their productive years, and when the local culture was unable to support them, th ey were thrown back on their own resources. Many had to forage for long hours every day just to grub enough nourishment to sustain life. Therefore, they sought not only for cu res to their ills, but for tonics, stimulants, and energizers to lighten the burden of the ir work, and restore a sense of youthful vigor. Thus, we hear of the revitalizing properties of soma, i n alchemical lore. Some of these traditional energizers include gotu kola, ginseng, ephed ra (or Mormon Tea), coca, and fo-ti-tieng. In any viewpoint short of full immortality, aging seems inevitable. There are, h owever, programs and practices which can slow down, and in some cases even rever se the aging process. Aging is a complex process which involves the gradually decline of various syste ms of orderly management or homeostasis in the body. Among these are breakdowns in t he auto- immune system, faulty replication of DNA, oxidation of fats in the body produc ing toxins, cross-linking of molecules aging the skin, arteries and other tissues, t he decline of the brain's chemical messengers, accumulation of wastes, hormone imbalance , lack of ability to repair damage. 2. Mental Acuity. Senility is a disease, not the inevitable mental condition i n old age. It has many causes and degrees of severity, but many of these may be relieved or preven ted with nutritional or drug therapy. Of primary importance is the production of neu rotransmitters which allow the brain cells to communicate effectively with one anot her, increasing access to stored information. The major neurotransmitters are norepinephri ne, acetylcholine, dopamine. When there are inadequate amounts of these in the brain, the res ult is depression, apathy, and ennui. Another major factor in decreased mental abi lity results from the breaking of fine, hair-like connections between brain cells , known as neurites. With these factors in mind, we may outline a program for rejuvenation of brain function, including the following:"},{"pageNumber":1000,"pageContent":"Hydergine stimulates the regrowth of connections between nerve cel ls which are necessary for learning and recall. In this way, it improves both alertness (R.A.S.) and high-level cognitive functions (cerebral cortex). The brain's intricate function depends on interactions at critical junctions between cells called synapses. These nerve jun ctions are in a fine network if fibers on the branching axons. According to the holographic paradigm of memory storage and retrieval, the more cells you bring together the more det ailed the information. Therefore, as this drug takes effect, overall memory improves; not everything will be immediately accessible to recall, but more detail is possi ble to recover. Vasopressin is a pituitary gland hormone which is marketed under the tr adename Diapid, in a nasal spray. It also improves memory and learning ability. It is a proven treatm ent for amnesia. During trauma, it may be released in massive doses from the pitui tary gland, initiating that flood of imagery where one's life flashes before the eyes . Marijuana use suppresses the release of pituitary vasopressin, and cocaine use stimu lates it (but also results in a depressing bloodpressure, reaction time, coordination, and visualization. Aging cuts down the amount of vasopressin secretion. Earl Hunt (1983) recounts the r esults of experiments: We also tested university alumni. A previous experiment had shown that in this educated population, visualization abilities decline with age, beginning in the 30' s. Only half of the participants over 40 could adopt the imaging strategy . (6) An effective clinical dose for improving memory is 16 I.U. per day, 4x nasally. There i s no deleterious effect on bloodpressure or urine retention at this dose. Wi th its direct relationship to visualization ability, this might prove of particular intere st to artists, engineers, and other who require this in their work. It is certainly req uired in the practice of magickal ceremony, where the maintaining of the visualization is crit ical in the effectiveness of the rite. Choline is an important nutritional factor as it is a precursor to acetylchol ine. Its inclusion in the daily supplements insures the availability of the proper compone nts for the body to synthesize this important neurotransmitter. It is required for m uscular control and proper muscle tone. Choline is most effective combined with lecithin an d Vitamin B-5 for easy conversion. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid which our brains use to synthesi ze Norepinephrine (also called noradreneline). It relieves the depression or \"drained\" feeling occurring when levels of this neurotransmitter are low. Depleted NE reserves are r esponsible for mental fatigue or lack of concentration. NE may be replaced at the synapse junction th rough doses of 100 to 1,000 milligrams per day of phenylalanine combined with Vitamins C and B-6. Do not combine this treatment with MAO inhibiting drugs used for de pression treatment. MAO inhibitors are used to treat depression because starting at age 45, MAO l evels tend to rise, and this destroys NE reserves resulting in depression. It is pr ecisely this MAO imbalance which produces the apathy of old age, including anxiety, depressi on, and less of interest in life's activities. this produces a shortage of norepinephr ine and other neurotransmitters, especially in the hindbrain, attacking the qualit y of one's experience of"},{"pageNumber":1001,"pageContent":"\"being alive\". Tricyclic compounds prevent this condition by stopping th e deamination of catecholamines in the brain and at the nerve synapse. Anyone using these ant i-depressants must avoid alcohol, amphetemines, and certain foods. Depression and anxiety str ess the body and accelerate the aging process. Serotonin is a companion to NE in the regulation of the experience of pain and pl easure. The overproduction of serotonin is linked to hyperactivity, then exhaust ion, anxiety and depression. Irritation by serotonin can also lead to overproduction of histami nes, adrenaline and noradreneline. When the exhausted system can no longer produ ce hormones to control normal functioning, a state of exhaustion ensues much like the \"come down\" from long term abuse of stimulant drugs. Serotonin irritation also ove rstimulates the thyroid. 3. Emotional Life. Fantasies of eternal youth are associated with the puer comp lex and one's attitudes toward aging. One of the most commonly accepted means of maint aining a zest for life comes from the vital connection existing between grandp arents and grandchildren. They offer a symbiotic reinforcement system for one anoth er, stretching from past to future with a sure continuity. there are several roles which gr andparents fulfill including providing the youngsters with an emotional history. T he child is an oracular vision of one's futurity. a. Historian --oral history of the cultural past --family historian; link to dead relatives --ethnic heritage; reenact rituals of the past in present --religious faith and values b. Mentor --emotional attachment fixes lessons in mind --lifetime of experience --working with life's basics (food, clothing, shelter, transportation) --deepen sexual identity --instill pride in a job well done c. Role Model --provide a model for grandparenting --role model for aging; adjustment to old age, and death itself --elders embody the last stage of life"},{"pageNumber":1002,"pageContent":"--attitudes, moral ideals, talents and behavior of the family d. Wizard --has lived a long time and learned to expect the unexpected --has no \"real\" power yet makes the seemingly impossible happen --accesses mystical dimension of life where dreams come true e. Nurturer --most basic role, physical and emotional --Great parents are primary caretakers when parents are absent An emotional sense of value and well being is maintained throughout the l ifespan when an individual has a meaningful position within the family. This sense of purpose and belonging eliminates loneliness and depression which accelerate the aging proc ess. One experiences immortality in the continuity of family life. 4. Physical fitness for long life includes a nutritional program started e arly in life to maintain systems, rather than a crash program for repair of damage. For life exte nsion, a consistent program including mega-vitamin doses, antioxidants, RNA and DNA supplements, and minerals is recommended. A new therapeutic treatment is Gerovital or GH-3, which reestablish es a balanced functioning, or homeostasis, in the body systems. It is a form of procaine, which is composed of the B vitamin PABA and diethylaminoethanol (DEAE). It is use ful in the treatment of anxiety and depression, without the limitations imposed by an MAO inhibitor. Its anesthetic qualities make it desirable for use by those with chron ic pain, such as that from arthritis. Gerovital's ingredient DEAE acts as a mood elevator, as do vasopre ssin, and Hydergine, providing a synergetic \"tonic\" or energizing effect of rejuvinat ion. Further Reading: 1.

Yesod is the automated consciousness or habit mind which is also sometimes called the Vital Soul, or realm of instin cts. In physics, this astral dynamism is known as electr omagnetic fields, the force which lies behind and p atterns all forms. Thus, the subconscious underlies and dir ects our mundane awareness in an analogous way to t hat in which EM fields are the subtle basis of matter. Behavior precipitates, as it were, from hidden subc onscious dynamics. We can raise much of this unconscious moti vation to awareness. Magical tradition asserts that the human faculty of imagination is capable of creating impressions in the astral substance which guide and direct subsequent manifestation. In modern language, creative visuali zation or dwelling on a though consciously or subconscious ly, increases the chance of altering EM field patte rns. This is neither objective nor subjective, since the wave fronts involved operate both externally in th e environment and internally in the organ of percepti on, the CNS. Therefore, magical exercises, carried our properly, are designed to establish and strengthen specific EM field patterns (or archetypes) with gre at clarity in the consciousness of the practioner. (Re f. Netzach on EM Fields & the Astral). Misuse of imagination has created chaos, error, and confusion in the collective consciousness. Generat ions of wrong thinking have left a groove on the cultural m ind, which manifests mostly as emotional fragmentat ion or misplaced zeal. Imagination is an essentially sp iritual power whose expression has been distorted. In Yesod we seek to reestablish emotional balance a nd control of responses and reactions which are usu ally below our threshold of awareness. At Yesod, this ap plies particularly to the channelling of intense reproductive urges. We seek connection with the upli fting aspects of sexual energy, rather than its ani malistic expression which might sap our vitality. This vitality is presented in the magical image of the sphere. But here it represents the power of reg eneration of the inner person. The force works through the ne rvous system and interior centers. In yoga these ce nters are called chakras, and the Serpent Fire or Kundali ni represents the dynamics of ascending consciousne ss. This energy goes by many names including prana and chi. It can be channelled by visualization. Yesod work helps us hone and correct our creative v isualization capacity. If our mental images are improperly formulated, disharmony results. Pain is an emotional signal which helps us correct our atti tudes and images of our goals. Yesod is the center of the formative world before it crystallizes into manife station. But we must not only work against our own lower imp ulses (shadow), but those of the collective (Advers ary). Focusing on right application of our self-conscious image-making faculty, we can release old blocks or habit patterns. Hypnotherapy may be helpful in this proce ss. Old destructive habits are easily given up when better solutions are internalized and become part of your new self-image. At first it takes conscious effort to divert the flow into the new channels of reaction. But soo n constructive new habits become the norm. Yesod is the realm of instincts. After purifying th e body comes the work of purifying the psyche. It m eans becoming aware of one's shadow and responses that a re not in harmony with the goals of the Higher Self . It doesn't mean suppressing emotions, because bottled up feelings explode like a pressure-cooker. We creat e a channel for the liberating powers of the Self, whic h facilitates our natural, organic growth. The higher Self can use the power of suggestion to influence the subconscious. It prepares the instinc tual level for the transpersonal influx or transmutation. This mainly has to do with \"original pain\" work, healin g misperceptions, faulty self-images, and emotional w ounds or complexes--changing our \"script.\" We all ha te to give up our habits, and this means the pain of o vercoming resistence to change. Patterns in our beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and be havior are deeply conditioned by the subconscious a nd the early development in our personality of script deci sions, scripts, rackets, and games, such as \"No Joy ,\" or \"No Love.\" If most of your thoughts about yourself counteract your higher mind ideals, then progress w ill be very slow. This is where therapy may help you clear out some old baggage. Then your ideals can be incorporated into your foundation, your new image. This new self image must be frequently reinforcd by images of success. If you find yourself thinking n egative thoughts about yourself or the world, just tell you rself to Stop!, and change the program--divert your attention, change the self-talk. Yesod contains the patterns of all possible forms a nd metaphorms. The astral plane includes but extend s beyond the physical plane. Certain simple geometric al figures can be discovered through nature and the psyche. These archetypal forms include the cross, t he square, the circle, the regular polygons, etc. T heir proportions contain representations of the dynamic forces in the universe. They are the virtual underp innings of sound vibration, light and color, gravitation an d electromagnetism. These properties are the format ive blueprints of everything which comes into physical being."},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"They are expressions of the One in the Many like th e Jungian archetypes. These basic ideas and symbols of the collective unconscious also express the One in the Many. When God commanded \"Let there be Light,\" H e also meant in the panoply of our thoughts and imagi nation. And in the virtual reality of the astral, t houghts and feelings have the same concrete reality as a ma terial object or experience. That is why hypnothera py works tangible results in people through their inne r journeys. When the imagery changes, so do the atti tudes associated with it. For the magician, the astral light is his medium to be influenced and formed through concentrated imagination and will. Even the most tenuous ideas i nfluence it, and concentrated focused energy sets t he formative forces in motion. The Collective Memory i s its other function as the repository of all exist ence and experience. John Gowan (1975) describes the three major modes o f consciousness (or contact between the individual ego and the divine) as Trance, Art, and Creativity. Eac h state has particular characteristics which corres pond precisely with Tree of Life modelling. a) Yesod = Trance state = prototaxic mode, characte rized by loss or overwhelming of ego; signs, psycho motor phenomena, subconscious ideomotor responses in ther apy and divination. Most people live in a trance st ate called \"ordinary consciousness,\" or consensus reali ty. They rarely get out of that trance. Shamanic st ates and trance dancing are other examples. Any constant, re petitive signal to the central nervous system will induce a trance state of varying depths. Cultural expectatio ns give permission to act on impulses originating i n that state which may seem to originate \"outside\" oneself (such as possession by Loas in Voudoo). b) Path 25, Trump XIV, ART = Art = parataxic mode, characterized by the production of images whose meaning is not clear or categorical; personal or id iosyncratic use of symbols and imagery; affective i mages. Metaphorms are produced when the mind imposes its o wn structure on its perception of the universe. A characteristically \"lunar\" consciousness, which shi fts to the Solar consciousness of c). Tiphareth = Creativity = syntaxic mode, where m eaning is more or less fully cognized symbolically, with the ego fully present; cognitive symbols. This stag e includes such diverse experiences as nature mysti cism, tantric sex, visualization, alpha feedback, meditat ion, peak experiences and higher jhana states. Also germaine is an Orientation System. The Causal level . Creativity is the result of the harmonizing of lu nar and solar elements. YETZIRAH, the Emotional Plane The common name for this plane of awareness is the Astral Plane or Astral Light. It is synonymous with the alchemical idea of the Anima Mundi , or Soul of the World. The Jungian idea of the Coll ective Unconscious as the treasurehouse of fluctuating imagery is a moder n explanation for the experience of this phenomena. Theoretically, all experiences are available for do wnloading from this archive. This might be the sour ce of past life memories, the so-called Akashic Record. The Astral Light is also perceived behind the pheno menon of EM fields and their effects in patterning physical manifestations. \"The Astral Light is an omnipresent and all-permeat ing fluid or medium of extremely subtle matter; sub stance in a highly tenuous state, electric and magnetic in co nstitution, which is the model upon which the physi cal world is built. It is the endless, changeless, ebb and flow of the world's forces that, in the last resort, gua rantee the stability of the world and provides its foundation. Yesod is this stable foundation, this changeless e bb and flow of astral forces, and the universal reproductive power in nature.\" (Regardie, 1970). There are two distinct divisions into a Lower Astra l and Higher Astral Plane. The Lower Astral include s the grossest manifestations of contact with the divine through instincts and uncontrollable psychomotor phenomena influencing the body. The Higher Astral i s the plane of images and affects, including emotio nal response. The lower astral is characterized by dissociation a nd loss or absence of memory and ego functions typi cal of trance states. The higher astral includes the first attempts to impliment the will in a relationship w ith the subconscious forces. This is the arena of shamanic healing and hypnotherapy, where trance is utilized to reprogram dis-ease. In the Astral Plane, archetypes are perceived in images or mind-pictures; often th is means only a vague awareness or foreboding or a vis ceral reaction. They can also appear as psychic impressions. The astral is also the realm of dream and divinatio n. It is the Lunar plane of psychism and mediums. T he Astral Body is the vehicle for exploration or trave l in this plane. Here, both godforms and matter ( Maya ) are visible. The Astral Plane influences the body throu gh the parasympathetic nervous system or the Centra l Nervous System. Its negative effects include over-e motionalism."},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"Psychological reflection in this plane leads to the acquisition of reliable information concerning sel f- knowledge. All other experience here, especially fo r purely personal gain, is to be discouraged. Yesod as the Prototaxic Mode of Awareness: The properties of various trance states vary depend ing on a number of factors: whether ego is totally absent or partially present; whether there is any memory o f the experiences; whether there is a negative or p ositive personal and social value; whether the experience w as sought or induced, considered and illness, thera py, grace, or divine; whether there are physical sympto ms, and whether or not the trance state was learned or conditioned, such as by trauma (PTSD). The prototaxic mode, trance, is an archaic mode of primitive consciousness. In ancient times it probab ly helped us overcome extreme pain and fatigue, and sh amanic trance was among the first religious impulse s of man. Trance involves the body in automatic, somatic , and kinesthetic behavior. It is characterized by dissociation, awe, dread, horror, and panic. There may be sensations of extreme heaviness or floating. Trance includes such phenomenal experiences as possession, mediumship, hypnosis, guided visualization, channelling, astral projection, psychedelic drug ex perience, and paranormal aspects including ESP. Its range extends from the extreme dissociation of schizophrenia to the religious ecstasy of mystics a nd the magical flight of shamans. At the lower end of the prototaxic scale, ego control is weak or absent, an d there is a general amnesia regarding experiences in the tran ce state. Though the trance state produces some intriguing paranormal effects, it is the grossest f orm of contact with the divine powers of the subcon scious. It has an uncanny, sometimes awesome quality. Through a taxonomy of these manifestations we may e stablish the relative value of these altered states of consciousness: 1. Dissociations: Schizophrenia (total dissociation from daily life) is the grossest form of t rance, and forms a compulsively consuming virtual reality with total immersion. The sc ript here is \"No Exit.\" Panic reactions, including mob contagion; terrifying sense of peril; guil t or sense of personal responsibility; disturbed erotic involvement or socially uns anctioned sex life. Script is \"No Joy.\" Positive disintegration (regression in the service of transcendence) is the necessary dissolution of the old self image and programming preceeding enlightenm ent. As a mental illness, it is characteristic of shamans, psychologists and other cas es of the \"wounded-healer\" archetype. Hysteria including hyperarousal and psychosomatic conversion-reactions , such as skin disorders, free-floating aches and pains, hypochochondria, etc. Unstressing is a behavior outlet for the psychic tension accruing from the confrontation with the powers of the Collective Unconscious. Occurs spon taneously in therapy, meditation, and religious trance. Includes \"talking in tongue s,\" dancing, shaking, motor automatisms (spasms, gasps, twitches, jerking, weeping, laugh ter, headaches, etc.). 2. Trance States Sleep, where images are profuse, but the ego/will is absent; Possession, where the individual ego is usurped by a malevolent demon or spir it; Mediumistic trance is a form of possession where a benign, dead, or ascend ed spirit controls and dominates the individual ego;"},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"Group trance dance, such as practiced by American Indians and at Raves, Suf is, and Voodoo are also form of possession, with paranormal manifestations. Other temporary restructuring of reality orientations come through: Psychedelic Drugs, which provide vivid imaginal \"trips\" which the ego h as difficulty recalling and integrating meaningfully. Can mean development al forcing and rupture. Sensory deprivation produces hallucinations and disorientation as the e xternal input ceases and only the inner world plays out centerstage. Hypnosis and Self-Hypnosis produce four classic depths of trance for th erapeutic benefit. Shamanic trance is a high form of prototaxic operation. The sorcerer's mission is to influence the environment by magic. He is not possessed by spirits but c ontrols them. He retains his memory of magical flights or out-of-body experiences. H e receives and remembers instructions from dreams, and because of his ow n wounding and recovery has the ability to heal. Magical trance is the prototaxic form of Lunar magic. It uses psychic powers for personal interests. Its parataxic mode form is ritual; its syntaxic activit y is visualization. 3. Paranormal Aspects: ESP (telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychometry); Hallucinations; Anesthesia of pain and healing; Fire-walking and other mastery over fire; Psychokenesis and poltergeist phenomena; Out-of-body (OOB) experience, magical flight, and astral projection; Automatic writing or \"channelling;\" Psychic Surgery. 4. Higher trance; religious trance, theophanies or mystical experiences. This is the upper border of the lower astral realm. It marks increased freedom from psychic contagion and superstition. Subconscious beliefs make many phenom ena work on others--expectations are crucial and we are vulnerable at the most fundamental level. At this juncture, consciousness shifts modes of awa reness, making a quantum leap to the Parataxic Mode known as ART. This is the realm of METAPHORMS: arch etypes, dreams, ritual, myth, art, ceremonial. It i s an expression of the \"We Are\" consciousness of the c ollective psyche. There is general increase in cons cious participation, memory, and movement from awe and dr ead toward pleasure as tensions are released in creative activity. Frequently these include ritual (ceremonial) or the production of a socially recogn izable work of art with collective value. Further progress on this continuum leads to increas ed cognitive awareness. Visualization ability is consciously cultivated, and a form of psychic \"map\" is adopted, such as the qabalistic Tree of Life. I ncreasing self-realization leads to the desire to meditate, s eeking higher experiences of human fulfillment. The Syntaxic Mode means the ego cooperates with the inner processes enough to remain fully conscious a nd in an Ordinary State of Consciousness. It voluntari ly subordinates itself to the transpersonal energy of the divine. It surrenders to engaging in the paradoxica l overthrow of itself, in favor of a greater whole."},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":" THE HOLISTIC QABALAH: A Contemporary Guide to Magick by Philo Stone (aka Richard and Iona Miller), 1983 BOOK III Sphere 9: YESOD, the Moon "},{"pageNumber":1009,"pageContent":"YESOD: Table of Contents PART II.

Its manifestations range from reflective and purely automatic impulses of ge neration to providing a source of inspiration. This fluctuating world of shape-shift ing forms is known in mythology as ISIS, the Great Mother who contains all other goddesses. She rep resents the archetypal virginity of the feminine aspect of Godhead, its all-encompas sing receptivity. The characteristic experience of Yesod or the lower astral plane is a tranc e state of varying depth. Most commonly, ego, memory and control are weak or absent. There is diss ociation from an Ordinary State of Consciousness. If memory of the imagery experien ce is retained, it may be misinterpreted or distorted, resulting in no effective assi milation into daily life. Receptivity is the keyword for Yesod, which in the Four Worlds is repres ented by the following: 1. Physical Plane: In the phenomenal world Yesod is characterized as the e lectromagnetic fields, known by physicists to be the formative basis of matter. In the human body, the genitals represent Yesod. Instincts act on the body producing pyschomot or automatisms, or the automatic gut-feel responses. Astrologically, Yesod is the Moon or Lun a. Gareth Knight links Pan to Yesod stating that \"Pan gives the idea of archetypal strengt h which is characteristic of the etheric and of the action of the Moon on Earth.\" Pan's app earance here also indicates his other manifestations including panic reacti ons, nightmare, guilt, and disturbed erotic involvement. Hyperarousal. 2. Astral Plane: At this level one can tap the reservoir of life-force or pr anic energy. Kundalini is a physical manifestation of the astral form of Yesod. The ther apeutic practice of Bioenergetics resolves repression and traumas releasing vitality. This l evel of lunar consciousness includes one's personal reactions to the complex envir onment. Yesod is a sphere of personal awareness. The personality is a unique complex of emoti ons and thoughts. This is the level of Moon Magic (i.e. Wicca). It provides no access past t he Astral Plane. Its negative effects include overemotionalism or reactiveness . 3. Causal Plane: From the psychological perspective, Yesod is the realm of Im agination and Archetypes. One may experience it through Trance or various Art forms. The re is understanding of the contrasexual aspect of the anima and animus. There is r elease from possession and enhanced control of emotions through employing the imaginative t echnique of personification of divine forces. 4.

In physics, this astral dynamism is known as electromagnetic fields, the force which lies behind and patterns all forms. Thus, the subconscious un derlies and directs our mundane awareness in an analogous way to that in which EM fields are the sub tle basis of matter. Behavior precipitates, as it were, from hidden subconscious dyn amics. We can raise much of this unconscious motivation to awareness. Magical tradition asserts that the human faculty of imagination is capable of cr eating impressions in the astral substance which guide and direct subseq uent manifestation. In more modern parlance, creative visualization or dwelling subconsciou sly on something repeatedly, increases the chance of altering EM field patterns. This is neither objective nor subjective, since the wave fronts involved operate both externally in the en vironment and internally in the organ of perception, the CNS. Therefore, magical exerci ses, carried out properly, are designed to establish and strengthen specific EM field patterns (or archetypes) with great clarity in the consciousness of the practitione r. (Ref. EM Fields and Their Relation to the Astral, in Holistic Qabalah, Netzach). Misuse of imagination has created chaos, error, and confusion in the collecti ve consciousness. Generations of wrong thinking have left a groove on the cultur al mind, which manifests mostly as emotional fragmentation or misplaced zeal. Imaginat ion is an essentially spiritual power whose expression has been distorted. In Y esod we seek to reestablish emotional balance and control of responses and reactions which are usually below our threshold of awareness. At Yesod, this applies particularly t o the channeling of the intense reproductive urge. We seek connection with the uplifti ng aspects of sexual energy, rather than its animalistic expression. \"The phallic symbolism evident in the Magical Image of Yesod (Ithyphallic Youth) needs to be understood as referring to the reproductive energy as it expresses th roughout all levels of life. The regeneration attributed to this energy in man never refers to the external organs, but to the interior nervous organism. It is this inner force that is alw ays meant; the force that works through the interior centers and is known as the Serp ent Fire, Kundalini, or Prana. Yesod tests and corrects the patterns we formulate with our ability to cr eate mental images by projecting them into the field of sensation in Malkuth. If our imager y is based on error, disharmony results and the ensuing pain helps to make us aware of the nee d for more work to free ourselves from succumbing to the errors in the collective cons ciousness. The formative aspects of Yesod are directly under the dominion of the self-con scious image- making faculty in man. We can release old blocks or habit patterns by a more enli ghtened use of our self-conscious powers. Old destructive habits are easily given up when resistance to new, more constructive forms of reactions is given up. This takes a consciou s effort at first to divert the flow of energy from the deeply grooved pattern into a new c hannel. But soon the new, constructive emotion becomes habit. After the work of purifying the body comes the work of purifying the psychi cal nature. This means an upgrading of our automatic response and reactions to life.

Mainly this means overcoming resistance to change. The subconscious mind creates patterns in our thoughts, emotions, and be havior. If the mainstream of your thoughts, acts and emotions counteract your Higher Mind ide alisms, then not much of these actually get incorporated into your foundation.

YETZIRAH, the Emotional Plane The common name for this plane of awareness is the Astral Plane or the As tral Light. The Astral Light is synonymous with the Alchemical idea of the Anima Mundi , or Soul of the World. The Jungian idea of the Collective Unconscious as the treasure hous e of fluctuating imagery is a modern explanation for the experience of this phenomena. The Astral Light is also perceived behind the phenomenon of electrom agnetic fields and their effects in patterning physical manifestations. The Astral Light is an omnipresent and all-permeating fluid or medium of e xtremely subtle matter; substance in a highly tenuous state, electric and magne tic in constitution, which is the model upon which the physical world is built. It is the endless, changeless, ebb and flow of the world's forces that, in the last resort, guarantee the stability of the world and provides its foundation. Yesod is this st able foundation, this changeless ebb and flow of astral forces, and the universal reproductive power in nature. (1 ) There are two distinct divisions into a Lower Astral and Higher Astral P lane. The Lower Astral includes the grossest manifestations of contact with the Divin e through instincts and uncontrollable psychomotor phenomena influencing the body. the Higher Astral is the plane of images and affects, including emotional response. The Lower Astral is characterized by dissociation and loss or absence of memory and ego functions. Th e Higher Astral includes the first attempts to implement the will in a rel ationship with the sub- conscious forces. In the Astral Plane, archetypes are perceived in image s or mind-pictures; often this means only a vague awareness or foreboding."},{"pageNumber":1014,"pageContent":"The Astral is also the realm of dream and divination. It is the Lunar plane of p sychism and mediums. The Astral Body is appropriate for exploration or travel in this plan e. Here, both Godforms and matter (Maya) are visible. The Astral Plane influences t he body through the parasympathetic nervous system or the Central Nervous System. Its negati ve effects include over-emotionalism. Psychological reflection in this Plane lead s to the acquisition of reliable information concerning self-knowledge. All other experie nce here, especially for purely personal gain, is to be discouraged. The goal is to develop a cognitive understanding within the depths of the s ubconscious mind by observing the rich forms, exotic dreams, and luxurious images which present themselves in this medium. On the Astral Plane, symbols are living ent ities! The Astral Light, having no characteristics or form is fluidic, watery, reflective, and impressionable. Trying to create an impression on the astral substance (through visualization ) which manifests latter in fulfillment of one's desire is misuse of psych ic power for personal interest. This is the lowest form of magic, and to be shunned by all serious as pirants as a hindrance in the Work. INSERT PICTURE TREE 1: THE FOUR WORLDS \" The astral plane is said to include but extend beyond the physical plane of our everyday world, and the astral light (the light created by God's command 'Let the re be light\", according to Eliphas Levi) transmits the rays or waves or vibrations of human will-power, thought, feeling, and imagination. In terms of Jungian psychology it i s the medium of the archetypes, the basic ideas and symbols of the collective unconsc ious. In the astral plane thought, fancy and emotion have the same concrete reality as a s olid object here on the physical plane, and the astral light is a great reservoir of occu lt power (like the mana of the Polynesians, or the prana of Hindus). Every human thought makes an imprint on the astral light, it is said, and in it the seer can r ead the history of the distant past in the Akashic Record or Cosmic Memory, through it t he occultist can discern the reality behind the surface appearance of things, w ith it the magician works as a smith works with metals in his forge, shaping the subtle s ubstance of the astral light with the tools of concentrated imagination and will .\" -- Man, Myth & Magic , p. 1630 \"Its fluidity makes it easily suggestible.

Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice.

The stage of magickal practice after Yesod is Path 25 (Trump XIV, ART) w hich is attempted Knowledge and Conversation with this entity which personifi es one's True Will. As a Zelator, the aspirant seeks a lifestyle which is conducive to achievi ng the conditions required by his project. \"Change is stability\" and allows one to break fr ee of outmoded habit patterns. This change for the sake of the Great Work may never be und ertaken at the emotional expense of those close to you. No one ever made spiritual progress by walk ing over the backs of others. The Zelator is expected to conduct experiments with techniques of p hysical clairvoyance, such as testing with ESP cards. He is required to become proficien t in Hatha Yoga, or some other comparable physical discipline which encourages inner stilln ess. He learns the technique of pranayama, or control of breathing and other autonomic functions. All of this stilling of the body is for meditation. The Zelator learns how to control h is myriad thoughts (Dharana) and strives toward concentration. The Zelator embodies that aspirant who experiences a psychic state mid way between enthusiasm and love. He is energetic and dedicated, one might say fascinated with the sparkling imagery of his newly-found inner world. He has a fanaticism whi ch wears off once maturity on the Path is gained. The meditation is, in fact, the count erpoint to the overenthusiastic hyperarousal which might result in \"burn out\" if lef t unchecked. There is no advantage to \"too much, too soon\" and students of the Middle Path are cautioned to be moderate in all things, including meditation. Marathon meditation days, at this point, would tend to produce psychic dissociation, rather than a gradual integration of an expanded worldview. A Zelator rarely moves again after his initiation as the volumes of his Magick al Journal and Dream Diary are now too numerous. b. Ritual: The Value of Dreamwork The archetypes to be discovered and assimilated are precisely those which hav e inspired the basic images of ritual and mythology. These eternal ones of the dr eam are not to be confused with the personality modified symbolic figures that appear in nightmares or madness to the tormented individual. Dream is the personali zed myth. Myth is the depersonalized dream. --Joseph Campbell No one who does not know himself can know others. And in each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dream and tells us how differently he s ees us from the way we see ourselves. When, therefore, we find ourselves in a dif ferent situation to which there is no solution, he can sometimes kindle a light t hat radically alters our attitude; the very attitude that led us into the difficult sit uation. --C. G. Jung"},{"pageNumber":1019,"pageContent":"As we spend a large proportion of our lives in a dream state, a fuller underst anding of their implications may prove valuable. Today, there are several prevailing theories co ncerning the significance and value of dreams. No final statement about dream may be made. There are several approaches to each perspective which is assumed a priori. Ther e are many alternatives to choose from. One's choice of style in dreamwork will be d etermined by the mythemes currently embraced. The characteristic attitudes assoc iated with the archetypes will motivate and influence one's approach to the dreamworld. Strephon Kaplan Williams (3) (Jungian-Senoi Institute) is one of the fo remost proponents of Dreamwork. He outlines a six-point program for continued use. 1. Dialogue with the dream characters, asking questions and recording answe rs. 2. Re-experience of the dream through imagination, art projects, and creati vity. 3. Examination of unresolved aspects of the dream, and contemplation of solution s. 4. Actualization of insights in daily life, where relevant. 5. Meditation on the source of dreams and insight from the Self. 6. Synthesize the essence of dreamlife and its meaning in a journal and app ly them in one's life journey. To offer a variety of other approaches, we will cover theories on dreams and dreami ng from Jung's original work, the analytical psychology school, para-psychology, and archetypal or imaginal psychology. Knowledge of the antiquated Freudian system is so wide-spread that no further comment here seems necessary. Jung was the first to depart from Freud's \"sexuality-fraught\" percep tion of dreams. Where Freud saw one complex, Jung saw many. He saw in dreams a gamut of archetypes overseen by the transcendent function, or Self. Analytical psychology ampli fied and clarified his original material. Most of this work is concerned with the fantasy of the process of individuation. It reflects an ego with a heroic attitude, and proc eeds by stages of development. Consciousness, at this stage, is generally monotheistic. It has a tendency to seek the center of meaning, as if there were only One. Parapsychological work d one with dreams also seems to reflect this attitude of searching, influencin g, and controlling. In Re-Visioning Psychology , James Hillman differs from the traditional analytical viewpoint by stating: Dreams are important to the Soul--not for the message the ego takes from them, not for the recovered memories or the revelations; what does seem to matter t o the soul is the nightly encounter with a plurality of shades in an underworld...the freeing of the s oul from its identity with the ego and the waking state...What we learn from dreams is what p sychic nature really is--the nature of psychic reality; not I, but we...not monotheis tic consciousness looking down from its mountain, but polytheistic consciousness wanderin g all over the place."},{"pageNumber":1020,"pageContent":"In Jung's model, one major function of dreams is to provide the unconscious w ith a means of exercising its regulative activity. Conscious attitudes tend to become one-sided. Through their postulated compensatory effect, dreams present different data and varying points of view. Individuation is the psyche's goal; it seeks to bring this about through an internal adjustment procedure. There is an admonition in Magick to \"balance each thought against its opposite.\" Dreams, according to Jung, do this for us automatically. However, ther e must be a conscious striving toward incorporation of the balancing attitudes pr esented through dreams (this applies equally to fantasies and visions). Another apparent function for a dream state is to take old information, containe d in long- term memory, incorporate it with those experiences, and integrate them with new experiences. This creates new attitudes. Since the dream conjoins current and past experiences to form new attitudes, the dream contains possible infor mation about the future. There is a causal relationship between our attitudes and the e vents which manifest from our many possible futures. In studies at Maimonides Dream Labs, Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman were trying to impress certain information on an individual's dream. They found th at an individual, being monitored for dream states, could incorporate a mandala, wh ich was being concentrated on by another subject, into his dream. This led to their famous theory on dream telepathy. Dream symbols appear to allow repressed impulses to be expressed in d isguised forms. Dream symbols are essential message-carriers from the instincti ve-archetypal continuum to the rational part of the human mind. Their incorporation enriches consci ousness, so that it learns to understand the forgotten language of the pre-conscious mind. The dream language presents symbols from which you can gain value through dream monitoring. You can use these dream symbols directly to facilitate commu nication with this other aspect of yourself. Should you choose later to re-program yourself out of ol d habit patterns, you're going to want an accurate conception of what dream symbols really m ean. A symbol always stands for something that is unknown. It contains more than it' s obvious or immediate meaning. The symbolic function bridges man's inner and out er world. Symbolism represents a continuity of consciousness and preconsciou s mental activity, in which the preconscious extends beyond the boundaries of the individu al. These primitive processes of prelogical thinking continue throughout life and do not indi cate a regressive mode of thought. Dream symbols are independent of time, space, and causality. The meaning of unconscious contents varies with the specific internal and external situation of the dreamer. Some dreams originate in a personal or conscious con text. These dreams usually reflect personal conflicts, or fragmentary impressions l eft over from the day. Some dreams, on the other hand, are rooted in the contents of the collective unconscious. Their appearance is spontaneous and may be due to some conscious experience, which causes specific archetypes to constellate. It is often difficult to distinguish personal contents from collec tive contents. In dreams, archetypes often appear in contemporary dress, often as persons vitally connec ted with us."},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"In this case, both their personal aspect (or objective level), and their si gnificance as projections or partial aspects of the psyche (subjective level) may be brought into consciousness. A dream is never merely a repetition of preceding events, except in the case of past psychic trauma. There is specific value in the symbols and context the psyche util izes. It may produce any; why is it sending just this dream and not another? Dreams rich in pictorial detail usually relate to individual problems. Universal contexts are rev ealed in simple, vivid images with scant detail. No attempt to interpret a single dream, or even the sequence dreams fall in, is fruitful. In fact, later research by Asklepia Foundation researchers asserts it is m ore important to journey using dreams as experiential springboards for therapeutic outc omes. In interpreting a group of dreams, we seek to discover the 'center of meani ng' which all the dreams express in varied form. When this 'center' is discovered by consc iousness and its lesson assimilated, the dreams begin to spring from a new center. Recu rring dreams generally indicate an unresolved conflict trying to break into consciousnes s. There are three types of significance a dream may carry: 1) It may stem from a definite impression of the immediate past. As a reac tion, it supplements or compliments the impressions of the day. 2) Here there is balance between the conscious and unconsciousness c omponents. The dream contents are independent of the conscious situation, and are so di fferent from it they present conflict. 3) When this contrary position of the unconscious is stronger, we have spontane ous dreams with no relation to consciousness. These dreams are archetypal in origin, and c onsequently are over-powering, strange and often oracular. (These dreams are not neces sarily most desirable to the student, as they may be extremely dangerous if the dreamer 's ego is still too narrow to recognize and assimilate their meaning.) We can never empirically determine the meaning of a dream. We cannot accept a meaning merely because it fits in with what we expected. Dreams can exert a reductive as well as prospective function. In other words, if our conscious attitude is inflat ed, dreams may compensate negatively, and show us our human frailty and dependence. Th ey also may act positively by providing a 'guiding image' which corrects a self-devaluing atti tude, re- establishing balance. The unconscious, by anticipating future consciou s achievements, provides a rough plan for progress. Each life, says Jung, is guided by a private myth. Each individual has a great sto re of DNA information. It is generally mediated by the archetypes which are deployed b y both myth and dream. As you create this individual or private myth, it attracts, if you wil l, an archetypal pattern and molds itself in a characteristic way (or visa versa). Th e archetype precipitates compulsive action. It is the motivating factor which may bec ome externalized in the physical world. Jung notes: \"The dreamer's unconscious is commu nicating with the dreamer alone. And is selecting symbols which have meaning to the drea mer and no one"},{"pageNumber":1022,"pageContent":"else. They also involve the collective unconscious whose expression may be soci al rather than personal.\" We may discover hidden meaning in our dreams and fantasies through the follow ing procedure: 1) Determine the present situation of consciousness. What significant events surround the dream? 2) With the lowering of the threshold of consciousness, unconscious con tents arise through dream, vision, and fantasy. 3) After perceiving the contents, record them so they are not lost (the H ermetic seal). 4) Investigate, clarify, and elaborate by amplification with personal meanings, an d collective meaning, gleaned from similar motifs in myth and fairy tale. 5) Integrate this meaning with your general psychic situation. INstinct s are the best guide; if you are obtaining \"value\" from your interpretation, it will \"feel\" corre ct. Complexes and their attendant archetypes draw attention to themselve s but are difficult to pinpoint. We may use conscious amplification of the symbolism presented in dream form. All the elements of the dream may be examined in a limited, controlle d, and directed association process, which enlarges and expands the dream material throu gh analogy. The nucleus of meaning contained in the analogy is identical with that of the d ream content. When a dream is falsely interpreted, others follow to correct the error. P reconscious contents are on the verge of being remembered. Just as language skills faci litate new conceptualization, knowledge of the vocabulary of dream symbolism allows clos er rapport with the preconscious. Dreaming is one of the easiest methods of contac t with the numinous element, or unknown. To illustrate how archetypes may affect perspective, we will now examine another of the methods for working with dreams and other images. If Freud's view on dream s can be seen as Aphroditic/sexual, and Jung's as heroic/developmental (Yesod and Tip hareth, respectively in QBL), then Hillman's newer \"Verbal Technique\" m ight be seen as associated with Hades, Lord of the Underworld or deep subconscious, (DA ATH in QBL). This relationship to the image is seeking value, depth, and volume. This method stresses keeping to the image as presented rather than anal yzing symbols. This method, while usable by anyone, is being applied by those who are thor oughly acquainted with symbols and their meaning in an attempt to recapture to un known element. The dream image expresses this if the symbols are not disse cted from their \"specific context, mood, and scene.\" An image presents symbols with th eir particularity and peculiarness intact. Dream presents a variety of images which are all in tra-related. Time and sequence are distorted in dream. Hillman prefers to view dr eam images with all parts as co-relative and co-temporaneous."},{"pageNumber":1023,"pageContent":"This approach to the dream is a sort of metaphorical word-play. The elements of the dream are chanted or interwoven. Repeat the dream while playfully rearranging th e sequence of events. Remain alert to analogies which form themselves during this word play. Ruminate on any puns which may occur. As the play unfolds, deeper significance emer ges as a resonance. By allowing the dream to speak for itself, interpretations appe ar indirectly. This is a method of communicating with the psyche which is in harmony with its inherent structure. In alchemy, it is known as an iteratio of the prima materia . Its value is evident, according to Hillman. \"We do not want to prejudice the phenomenal experience of their unknowness and our unconsciousness by knowing in advance that they are m essages, dramas, compensations, prospective indications, transcendent functi on. We want to get at the image without the defense of symbols.\" (1) The archetypal content in an image unfolds during participation with it . We have found that an archetypal quality emerges through a) precise portrayal of t he image (including any confusion or vagueness presented with the image); b) st icking to the image while hearing it metaphorically; c) discovering the necessi ty within the image (the fact that all the symbols an images presented are required in this c ontext); d) experiencing the unfathomable analogical richness of the image. (2) In this context, 'archetypal' is seen as a function of making. The adjecti ve may be applied to any image (6) upon which the operations are performed. This means that no sin gle image is inherently more meaningful than another. Value may be extracted f rom them all. This coincides with the alchemical conception of the Opus as work. Here th e Opus is carried by the dreamwork technique. Archetypal psychology contends that the value of dreams has little application to practical affairs. In Re-Visioning Psychology , Hillman postulates that: Dream's value and emotion is in relation with soul and how life is lived in relation with soul. When we move the soul insights of the dream into life for problem-solv ing and people-relating, we rob the dream and impoverish the soul. The more we get out of a dream for human affairs the more we prevent its psychological work, what it is doin g and building night after night, interiorly, away from life in a nonhuman worl d. The dream is already valuable without having any literalizations or personali stic interpretations tacked on to it. Hillman ends his \"Inquiry Into Image\" by stating that the final meaning of a dream cannot be found, no matter how it seems to \"click.\" Analogizing is like my fantasy of Zen, where the dream is the teacher. Each t ime you say what the image means, you get your face slapped. The dream becomes a Koan when we approach it by means of analogy. If you can literalize a meaning, \"interpre t\" a dream, you are off the track, lost your Koan. (For the dream is the thing, not what it means.) Then you must be slapped to bring you back to the image. A good dream analysis is one in which one gets more and more slaps, more and more analogies, t he dream exposing your entire unconscious, the basic matters of your psychic life ."},{"pageNumber":1024,"pageContent":"This type of analysis seems consistent with the origins of the word. Or iginally, it had to do with \"loosening.\" This type of dream analysis loosens our soul from its iden tity with day- to-day life. It reminds us that styles of consciousness other than that of th e ego have validity. The soul experiences these styles nightly. No paper of dreams would be complete without some mention of nightmare s. Even though dream is an easy method of contacting the unconscious, it is not always ple asant. Occult literature speaks of a figure called \"the Dweller on the Threshold.\" In Eastern philosophies there are the wrathful deities. This figure corresponds with Tr ump XV, The Devil, in Tarot. This seems consistent with Hillman's attribution of the dre am as Hades' realm. The healthy person learns easily to cooperate on his descents into the psyc he. The uninformed or neurotic personality is likely to encounter hindrances . These hindrances often take the form of frightening, monstrous, overpowering forces. Ego-consci ousness is not able to comprehend them. When the subconscious is highly activated the se images may occur during waking hours and in sleep. This dread and oppression form the basis for nightmares. Pan and his attendant phenomena (such as panic) are archetypal representations of the nightmare. Pan also corresponds with Trump XV . In the heroic model, as consciousness develops, there is a marked dif ference in both the content of dream and the dreamer. He gains increased ability to assimilate the charges of energy associated with the dream. The more conscious the experience of the numinous, the less fraught with irrationality and fear the experience. This holds tr ue in waking and sleeping hours. John Gowan, in Trance, Art, and Creativity , states, \"It is this gentling, humanizing process exerted on the preconscious by creative function of the individual whic h is the only proper preparation for the psychedelic graces.\" These graces include an immers ion of the ego in the expanded context of the subconscious. The ego is then able to return from its experience enriched by the contact. Contents which might formerly have been consid ered nightmarish are more fully understood, and the monsters become transformed into but terflies. (7) This attitude toward nightmare is not consistent with Hillman's appr oach. He does not advocate changing or controlling the psyche. This is, in fact, neither possible nor desirable. He asserts that to enter dream is to enter the underworld, Hades' re alm. Psychic images are metaphorical. All underworld figures are shades or shadow souls. Th ere is no reason for them to conform to the constraints of the ego's dayworld. Soul is the background of dream-work. Underworld is psyche. This relate s, therefore, to a metaphorical perception of death. Dreams present us with that differe nt reality, in which pathology and distortion are inherent aspects. We needn't control them, bu t rather acknowledge their value and depth. Assuming it is necessary or desirable to control any aspect of dream life, the re is a further development of consciousness which enables one to consistently experie nce what is known as the \"lucid dream\" or \"high dream.\" In a lucid state, there is an overlappi ng of normal waking consciousness coupled with the dream state. At this stage, one is able to progressively acquire and exercise will in dream states."},{"pageNumber":1025,"pageContent":"In the lucid dream, one \"witnesses\" the fact that one is dreaming, and may take an active role in the unfolding of the dream. This optional ability is generally ass ociated with the heart-center, or Tiphareth. The heart-center has to do with developin g consciousness of the imaginal realm. Rather than control or meddle with dreams, it is more effective to exer cise creative expression in waking hours. Many persons pursuing their fantasy of indivi duation have an outlet through active imagination. Active imagination is, in itself, an art f orm. It is generally practiced through a discipline, such as psychology, alchemy, or Magick. I t may be dramatic, dialectic, visual, acoustic, or in some form of dancing, paintin g, drawing, modeling, etc. People who give free rein to fantasy in some form of creative imagination often dre am less. All psycho-active drugs also tend to diminish dreaming. In other words, there seems to be a variable ratio between creativity and dre am. Jung made the discovery that \"this method often diminished to a considerable degree, the frequency and intensity of dreams, thus reducing the inexplicable pre ssure exerted by the unconscious.\" There need be no conscious desire to control or interfe re in the actual dream. The ego learns to meet the subconscious on a middle ground, the vale of s oul making. The activities and intent of both are harmonized. Staying close to the original image is fundamental. As of this writing (2002), experiential dreamwork or Dream Healing offers an even better prospect for therapeutic interaction within dream imagery. For a comp lete exposition of this school of dreamwork, rooted in Transactional Analysis and Gestalt, see the Asklepia Homepage, at http://asklepia.org c. Practical QBL: The Body of Light, Part 1; THE AS TRAL BODY The concept of subtle bodies created by the aspirant for experience on h igher planes is very old, indeed. Different vehicles are appropriate on different planes . For the physical plane, the human body is ideal. For the Astral Plane of images, a starry body or body of light is required which is a precise copy in the finer luminous \"material\" of that rarefied sphere. This light body has the ability of separating itself from the flesh and b lood body and has the ability to \"fly into the sky\" with none of the limitations of a mortal f rame. The astral body contains the fully functioning consciousness of the aspi rant. Its existence persists after physical death, and it is in this body that those who recall near death experiences of the \"other side\" were functioning. Magickally, the astral body is built in the imagination through the process of pr anayama, or control of the breath. However, original concepts of a starry body may be traced to classical Greek philosophy so the idea is not necessarily oriental in origi n. Aleister Crowley gave precise instructions for \"Getting into the Astr al Body\" in his classic work, Magick in Theory and Practice."},{"pageNumber":1026,"pageContent":"The proper method is as follows: Develop the body of Light until it is just as real to you as your other body...Ultimately, the relation of that body with your own must be exceedingly intimate; but before this harmonizing takes place, you should begin by a careful differentiation. The first thing to do, therefore, is to get the body outside your own. To avoid muddling the two, you begin by imagining a shape resembling yourself standing in front of you. Do not say: \"Oh, it's only imagination!\" The time to te st that is later on, when you have secured a fairly clear mental image of such a body . Try to imagine how your own body would look if you were standing in its place; try to transf er you consciousness to the Body of Light. Your own body has its eyes shut. Use the eyes of the Body of Light to describe the object in the room behind you... As soon as you feel more or less at home in the fine body, let it rise in the air. Ke ep on feeling the sense of rising; keep on looking about you as you rise until you see landscapes or beings of the astral plane. Such have a quality all their own. They are not like material things -- they are not like mental pictures -- they se em to lie between the two... Now, however unsuccessful your getting out of the body may apparently have been, i t is most necessary to use every effort to bring it properly back. Make the Body of Light coincide in space with the physical body...then recover the unity of conscious ness. If you fail to do this properly you may find yourself in serious trouble. Your Body of Light may wander away uncontrolled, and be attacked and obsessed. You will become aware of this through the occurrence of headache, bad dreams, or even more serious signs such as hysteria, fainting fits, possibly madness or paralysis. Even t he worst of these attacks will probably wear off, but it may leave you permanently damaged to a greater or lesser extent. It is interesting to note that all the potential symptoms of improper astr al work reflect the conditions of the lowest level of the prototaxic mode. So, the idea in astral w orking is to move upward in the planes toward an increase in conscious awareness. Bibliography 1.

Psychological Model: Mythical Living MYTHICAL LIVING A Metaphorical Perception of Experience by Philo Stone, c1977 Jung has suggested that each individual life is based on a particular myth, and that w e ought each to discover what our own basic myth is, so that we may live it consciou sly and intelligently, cooperating with the trend of this life pattern, instead of be ing dragged along unwillingly. These patterns can be seen recurring in the lives of certain people, who rem ain totally unconscious of what they are living. But if the individual becomes consciou s in relation to the archetypal trend that underlies his life--his fate--h e can begin to adapt himself to it consciously. The outer fate is then transmuted into the in ner experience, and the true individuality of the man or woman begins to emerge. This is an impor tant step in the quest for the Self. --M. Esther Harding/ The I and the Not-I I. Philosophy Myth may be defined as a paradigmatic model. In science, paradigms are thought -models which direct their holders to pose only certain questions and to utili ze only certain methods in search of answers. This precisely parallels the effect of a given archet ype when it is activated; it molds our attitudes in a characteristic manner so that we c atch certain things but ignore or omit what just doesn't fit."},{"pageNumber":1028,"pageContent":"The particular paradigmatic lenses we choose to form our conceptualizati on of reality function to shape the very reality we hope to capture and understand. By emph asizing particular relationships, or elements, they largely determine the natur e of the \"reality\" we experience. This conceptualization of reality is known as one's worldvi ew. A person who embraces a particular paradigm can create a reality from his expectations, e ven without conscious intent to do so. In our technological world, most paradigms stress a routine or mechanical s ide of life. In order to acquire experiential freedom from cultural programming, one must have a model. A model is required for realization. Myths, then, serve a key function in the psychic economy. Myths provide the most comprehensive metaphors, or models, for the realization of liberating al ternatives. The meaning in life is inherent in the archetypal experience of myth. The ae sthetic experience and its 'meaning' are identical. In a religious society, myths tell the people who they are and where they com e from. To change the myth is to become lost in the most profound ontological (1) sens e. Modern man lives in a world of intellectual fragmentation. He feels a need to dissect any and everything, especially himself, to find out the universal order of things and to seek hi s place in it. Mythological explanations arise when an individual or race evolves the three p rimary questions: 1) who am I? 2) where do I come from? 3) where am I going? The meaning of existence lies in a relevant answer to these questions. The se answers formulate one's worldview. With these questions, a universal seed within man begins to germinate. Self-consciousness begins to unfold its awareness of total ity. The finite mind begins to bridge the gap to infinite awareness. In seeking to find the beginning of creation, man must first cease think ing in terms of space and time. In Reality there is neither. It is an illusion that man is contain ed in space and time. In fact, both are contained in man. Both experiences, together, illust rates psychic experience. The Creations, as a psychological reality, was/is/will occur in t he realm of the sacred, not the profane world. With our human limitations, sacred time is exp erienced as multiple recurrence. It is thus a continuous, timeless-creation. A ll parts of the process are inherent in its wholeness. Likewise, wholeness is inherent in al l parts. This is the Alpha/Omega principle. As this universal seed starts to grow in an individual, he is plunged fr om his preconscious, womb-like security into a dazzling world of intellectual confusion. He experiences paradox. There is dichotomy, a lot of contradiction. So, man comes to duality of subject and object. Conflicts are produced, which, used creatively, may lead to the individu ation, the subjective and objective spheres merge into one."},{"pageNumber":1029,"pageContent":"II. Orientation A complete mythology provides helpful orientation in four ways: 1) In its metaphysical-mystical function, it wakens and maintains in th e individual an experience of awe, humility, and respect in recognition of the ultimate mystery which transcends words and form. 2) It provides a cosmology, or an image of the universe. Science now serves this mythological function, admirably. 3) On the social level, myth supplies validation and maintenance of an establ ished order. 4) Finally, on the psychological level, they provide models for the centering and harmonization of the individual. Mythologies perform these functions through symbols. The focal point provide d by image and symbol holds the mind to truth. The ultimate is, of course, unknowable. T herefore, the images themselves are not \"the truth.\" For contemporary man, a journey into his unconscious provides the vital meani ngs and relatedness to the cosmic order that myths once gave us. It is a return to th e source which goes a step further than genealogy. Meaning is inherent in conscious experien ce of archetypal processes. A model for pursuing the quest provides a foundation t o which one's experience may be related. The modern search for meaning is a variant of the age-old quest, or journey of th e hero. This mythological motif is activated whenever cultural values and mores do not provide an adequate model for one's experience. The social boundaries dissolve and a pe rson is thrown back on his own resources. Valuable connections and new forms must be re-established. During this period, symbols acquire great personal value. For many, this period is seen as an experience of rebirth or renewal. This heroic stage does not go on indefin itely. Questing fades into the background when one becomes familiarized with the imagin al realm. Both processes, questing for and participating in the imaginal realm, require attention, effort, and creativity. Evidence of man's great desire for this experience is found in the comm on use of drugs in the counterculture. Rather than the gradual path of study, experience, and assimilation, drugs may provoke experiences which are \"too much, to soon.\" Joseph Campbell has likened the situation to one found in Greek mythology \"in which a person s ays to a god, 'Show me yourself in your full power.' And the god does and the person is blown to bits.\" The personality suffers from an inability to relate, meaningfully, to socie ty. Drug experiences provide ample evidence of the world of the psyche, but in or der for us to obtain value from the contact, consciousness must be able to come to understan ding, digestion, and assimilation of the experience. Liberating experiences require a context of strong ego-consciousness. T his does not mean \"willful assertion.\" It means that the ego has learned to discriminate be tween itself and the"},{"pageNumber":1030,"pageContent":"archetypal processes operating through and around it. It means, also, that the ego has learned to defer to, and cooperate with them. A frightened ego, in danger of drowning in deep waters, will quickly regres s to the natural standpoint, otherwise unaffected by its contact with the numinous. Th e boon, which the successful hero may bring back (which has both personal and collective s ignificance), is not given to him. He does not find the gods cooperative. The lessons of the \"trip\" p rove most troublesome and provide no benefit in daily life. He is lucky if his wor st problem is merely the desire to stay \"high.\" There is a generation of \"world-weary\" people, eager t o transcend off into some mythical realm. However, their methods are eit her haphazard, or ill-advised. This type of unassimilable experience stimulates the complex of th e puer aeternus, or eternal adolescent. When it occurs in a woman, it is a puella complex. This compl ex is epidemic in our society, today. This was not the case a century ago, when our cult ural model was more strictly defined. The ideal lies somewhere betwee n, in a reunion of the values of tradition and futurity. This requires the ability to apply ones elf to the task. It requires self-motivation, diligent effort, and the grace of god. When man enters the myth of transformation, he sets out to change the world. Soon , he becomes aware that he must first change himself. In this moment of tr ansformation, myth is seen as an intuitive, ever-becoming processing. Man is not really containe d in the myth, and in time. Both myth and time are contained within himself. The gods and man are involved in a symbiotic relationship. Each requires the other for realizati on. When man seeks the motives behind the act of becoming, he transcends f rom concrete intellectual conception to metaphysical abstractions. Eventually, he come s to an understanding that metaphysics is the science of the content of myth. Th e so-called \"occult\" is mainly involved with developing man's latent subconscious pow ers, so he may develop greater access to the imaginal realm. This opens up a world which, b y definition, contains wider parameters for experience and growth. It provides a comprehe nsive, cohesive method and model. With it, man may live his individuality within the context of tradition. There are aspects of creative mythology, and its form of metaphorical percept ion, which tie it in with a holographic concept of reality. (2) Within metaphorical and mythic conception, a part does not merely stand in the pl ace of or represent the union of several elements, but rather it is identic al with the whole. If the part is the whole, then whoever controls the part controls the whol e. In normal discourse, symbols represent their referents and are separable from what th ey represent; in metaphorical or mythic conception, the symbols are their re ferents; they cannot be separated. The elegance of language lies in its capacity to separate symbol from experience so that symbols can be manipulated in a way that experiences cann ot be. While we cannot experience precisely the same thing ever again, we can att ach similar symbols to represent two experiences as being roughly the same . (3)"},{"pageNumber":1031,"pageContent":"The chaotic assortment of apparent and disguised mythological images have certain typical features. We may reduce the infinitely variegated and complex forms to their simplest expressions as a means of recognizing them. Jung's list of salient characteri stics includes: Chaotic multiplicity and order; duality; the opposition of light and da rk, upper and lower, right and left; the union of opposites in a third (complexio oppositorum ); the quaternity (square, cross); rotation (circle, sphere); and finally the centeri ng process and a radial arrangement usually followed by some quaternity system. The centering proce ss is...the never-to-be-surpassed climax of the whole development, and is character ized as such by the fact that it brings with it the greatest possible therapeutic effe ct. Experience of these archetypal processes offers the possibility of ori enting oneself. Several traditional mystical exercises stress the importance of the centeri ng process. Fundamental in these meditations is orienting oneself to the four cardinal directi ons. The role of creative imagination is fundamental. Virtually any experience available to man is inte grated via a form of imagery. Myth raises the individual to a superhuman or superhistorical plane. It en ables him to approach Reality that is inaccessible at the level of profane experience. If the mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate Reality of things, it is just because Real ity manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore cannot be expressed in concept s. James Hillman, Director of Studies in Imaginal Psychology at the University of Texas, states that \" We can describe the psyche as a polycentric realm of nonverbal, nonspatial images. Myth offers the same kind of world. It too, is polycentric, with innum erable personifications in imaginal space. Just as dream images are not mere words in di sguise...so the ancient personifications of myths are not concepts in disguise.\" He stat es further that these \"soul events are not parts of any system. They are independent of the tan dems in which they are placed, inasmuch as there is an independent primacy of the imaginal tha t creates its fantasies automatically, ceaselessly, and spontaneously. Myth-making is not c ompensatory to anything else.\" The more paradigmatic models one has access to, the more freedom of creation one experiences. \"It is egoistic to recognize oneself in only one portion of a tale , case in only one role.\" (4) Polytheistic consciousness allows us to experience the ga mut of archetypal perspectives. This leads the individual to broader consciousness and gre ater tolerance of other individual's perspectives. Myth is the comprehensive metaphor, \"answering our requirements for i ntellectual puzzlement and explanation through enigma by providing as-if fictions in de pth, complexity, and exquisite differentiation.\" \"Myth,\" says Hermann Broch, \" is the archetype of every phenomenal cognition, of which the human mind is capable. Archet ype of all human cognition, archetype of science, archetype of art--myth is consequen tly that archetype of philosophy, too.\" We might deduce from this that myth functi ons as a sort of metapsychology. Mythic metaphors elude literalism; they dramatically present them selves as impossible truths. They have the ability to transform concrete particulars into univer sals, and to"},{"pageNumber":1032,"pageContent":"present abstract universals as concrete actions. They are ways not only of spe aking, perceiving, and feeling, but of existing. We may experience mythical consci ousness by finding Gods in our concrete lives. They are found by entering myths, since t hat is where they are. We may participate with them by recognizing our concrete existence as metaphors, or mythic enactments. However, Hillman is very deliberate in stating that: \"myths resist bein g interpreted into practical life. They are not allegories of applied psychology, solutions to person al problems. This is the old moralistic fallacy, now become the therapeutic fallacy, tel ling us which step to take and what to do next, where the hero went wrong and had to pay the consequen ces, as if this practical guidance were what was meant by 'living one's myth'.\" \"Living one's myth doesn't simply mean living one myth. It means that one li ves myth; it means mythical living...to try to use a myth practically keeps us still in t he pattern of the heroic ego, learning how to do his deeds correctly. Myths do not tell us how. The y simply give the invisible background which starts us imagining, questioning, goi ng deeper.\" Myths do not carry one to a central meaning, or the center of meaning. \"To enter myth we m ust personify, to personify carries us into myth.\" III. Exercise Personification is a mode of viewing archetypal processes in their traditi onal forms as gods and goddesses. This method allows us to love the gods, giving them attention and w orship. Their names aid us in discriminating them one from another. They give us t he ability to call upon them. This process of devotion takes place in the imaginal realm of the heart. In Q BL, this is Tiphareth, the heart-center. In Eastern systems, it is known as anahata c hakra. It is the realm of soul-making. Personification is a spontaneous process, springing fr om the heart, where imagination reigns. This process of active imagination allows us to \"s ee through\" the literalisms of mundane existence and to participate in relationships with the divine. A primary purpose of Middle Pillar Exercise is to orient oneself with t he Universe (5). It promises equilibration and renewal. In Middle Pillar Exercise, the gods are brought into consciousness by intoning their names. This creates a resonance effect which stimulates glands. These names are related, via correspondence, to various centers in th e body. Repeated practice of Middle Pillar Exercise is fundamental for any Magick al development. It heals the culturally-preprogrammed split between mind, soul and body. The Banishing Ritual and Middle Pillar Exercise are particularly effe ctive because they are a dramatization of the Creation Myth. In his book, The Sacred and the Profane, Mir cea Eliade states, The creation of the world becomes the archetype of every human gesture, what ever its plane of reference may be. Every construction or fabrication has the cosmogon y as paradigmatic model. Techniques of orientation (aligning oneself to the directions), are de signed for the construction of sacred space. The more closely a ritual reproduces the work of the gods in"},{"pageNumber":1033,"pageContent":"creation, the more effective it is in producing the desired psychologi cal results. Knowing the value of a ritual satisfies both the rational and aesthetic mind. The model for the creation of sacred space begins from a center and projects horizons in the four cardinal directions. This model has been followed throughout h istory when settling new territory or in the founding of cities. We always reside at the center of \"our world.\" This quadrated circle sets up the conditions necessary for us to enter into sacred time. The Banishing Ritual \"cleanses\" the portion of space within the perimet er of the circle. This eliminates unwanted thoughts which could cause distraction. One then has enhanced ability to focus and concentrate. The circle is cleared of all 'entities ,' good or evil. Then one may call in specific gods, at will. We may contact the gods through the medium of t he sacred pole or cosmic pillar. Sacred time appears under the paradoxical aspect of circular time, revers ible and recoverable, a sort of mythical eternal present that is periodically rei ntegrated by means of rites. When we enter this space, we experience the feeling of immortality, sin ce we are in a time which is equivalent to the \"beginning.\" The principle characteris tics of sacred space are: a) A break in the homogeneity of space; b) This break is symbolized by an opening where passage from one cosmic regi on to another is facilitated (i.e. between heaven and earth; earth and the unde rworld); c) Communication with heaven is expressed by variants of the Cosmic Pill ar, which stands at the Center of the World. This Pillar is a useful symbol for what is termed in psychology the Ego-Se lf Axis. The axis is built up through various psychological exercises, involving active imagination . It forms the link between ego-consciousness and the Self. This represents b oth the conscious and subconscious mind working together in harmony. It is known in Magick as K nowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Banishing and Middle Pillar exercises conform precisely to the c reation myth. Since a myth is a paradigmatic model, one can see it is a very effective exercise. I t establishes one's relationship to the cosmos, or totality. Eliade has said: What men do on their own initiative, without a mythical model, belongs to th e sphere of the profane; hence, it is a vain and illusory activity, in the last analysi s, unreal. The more religious a man is, the more paradigmatic models he possesses to guide hi s attitudes and actions. The importance of persistent practice of Middle Pillar technique , throughout the Magickal career, is not to be underestimated. Israel Regardie is quite firm on th is point. To my mind, the exercise described as the Middle Pillar is the groundwork of all ac tual developmental work. It is a process which is the basis of Magic. That this has been but seldom realized is obviously at the root of the futile attempts to do Ceremonial an d"},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"perform Ritual, of which the general public hears every now and again. Even studen ts of Magic of many years standing have been guilty of negligence in this respect, an d also in failing to recommend it to their successors. ( 6) Timelessness will appear as a multiple recurrence (chronicity ). The archetypal order will make these appearances regular, both in time (wave frequency) and magnitu de (wave amplitude). The ego has the option of actively participating in the process th rough the medium of active imagination. This develops insight. To restore our earth to a ground in creative imagination we must re-imagine th e creation. (7) b. Archetypal Encounter: Lunar (or Feminine) Consci ousness What constitutes awareness? The day-world of ego-consciousness has been c alled Solar conscious and considered masculine in nature. Nevertheless, even with out this rational mode of solar-consciousness, we experience the primordial, diffuse awa reness of Lunar (or Feminine) consciousness. This is our basic psychic reality, from whic h the ego- consciousness later emerges. Psyche (Greek) or Anima (Latin) means soul. So anima-consciousness or s oul- consciousness indicated an awareness that perceives fantasy creating real ity. Anima- consciousness comes through images. It brings awareness that fantasies are everywhere. They are not separate from reality, but fundamental to our notions about realit y. Jung says, \"image is psyche.\" Anima (or soul personified) combines the innocent virginity of the sou l's unsullied pristine state with the sophisticated worldliness of the fertile Great Mot her (White Goddess). She is the embodiment of the Woman's Mysteries. Anima, as the archetype of psychic consciousness makes us aware of our areas of unconsciousness. Soul, in its relationship with spirit constantly i nvades the day-world consciousness with images, fears, moods, and mystery. It is elusive, paradoxic al, and ambiguous. This mode of perception is conscious of its unconsciousness an d can recognize the potential latent in the unknown aspect. It could be characterized a s \"illumined lunacy.\" Anima-consciousness is that mode which is appropriate to experienc e in the astral plane and astral body. The realm of imagination is psychic reality. Anima-consciousne ss is a multi-centered polytheistic perspective (thus a pagan orientation i s appropriate to Lunar Magic). Its concern is being-in-soul not becoming. It is perceived as a coinc idence of processes. All phases of the eternal cycles are present at once, enfolde d in any part of the whole. It is experienced as a series of superimposed images. It is reflec tive and concerned with inter-relationship rather than analysis. It is diffused, not foc used awareness. Anima mediates the unknown, or unconsciousness. It forms a bride to the day-wor ld consciousness. The Anima serves as a mediatrix for consciousness. She mediates betwee n the personal and collective, balancing the actualities of daily life with the realities of the beyond. She bridges"},{"pageNumber":1035,"pageContent":"the individual conscious horizon and the primordial realm of the imagination . The feeling developed through this soul-making process is more impersonal than pe rsonal. As the Great Goddess, Anima or Psyche represents the archetypal con taining vessel. In current psychological thought, consciousness itself is seen as more approp riately based upon anima than upon ego. The ego and its developmental fantasies never were th e foundation for consciousness. Consciousness refers to a process having mor e to do with images than will. It is reflection rather than control, with a reflecti ve insight. Therefore, consciousness arising from soul derives from images and can be called im aginal. It looks to myth as it manifests in dreams, fantasies, and life patterns. \"Becoming conscious\" now takes on new meaning. It means becoming aware of one 's fantasies and recognition of them everywhere. They are not merely in a a 'fantas y world' separate from 'reality'. The aspirant can analyze by means of fantasies and th en translate reality back into fantasy images. Personifying is an effect of the anima archetype. Libido (psychic energy or p rana, life force) can only be apprehended in a definite form. It is identical with the fantasy images. The Holy Guardian Angel's individuation into a distinct personality is precisely what soul- making is about. If you personify the Soul in the form of the Great Goddes s, Anima, or Psyche she will act as a soul-guide on the inner planes. Anima consciousne ss now means seeing, listening, attending all shift from the gross attachments of th e material plane to the shining and transparent resonance of subtle astral forms. This meeting of s oul with Soul is what the astral plane is all about. 'Psychology' is composed of psyche and logos. It is an interaction between anima an d psychological intellect. The logos, or spirit principle, gives speech to psyc he. Psychology is the speech of the soul, which combines both lunar and solar components. It w ould seem that the airy quality of Yesod and the building of an \"astral body\" are not irr elevant in psychology. The secret and key of psychological work requires the airy imagination of soul, th at is, the capacity of imagining events \"outside\" of the natural bodily perspective of e mpirical and material literalism but in regard to a subtle or fantasy body of psychic real ity. Being-in- soul requires being in a body too, but this body is built of soul stuff; i t is a \"breath body.\" Fantasy images are this stuff, this \"subtle body.\" The key to the entire psychological opus...is body-building via imagination. (8) This body building is a creative act of fantasy. Within it, the many do not becom e one but become psychic material. An example of this process is memory (also an attribute of Yesod). Anima and matter unite when psychic experiences (9) are enc oded in the brain cells of the physical body. Lunar consciousness runs the cyclic gamut from the bright diffuse light of full moon through the half-darkness, to the blackened nature of the dark of the moon. It s nocturnal quality and lower luminosity don't make it any less powerful than the solar i nfluence. INSERT PICTURE QUEENS OF HEAVEN"},{"pageNumber":1036,"pageContent":"(1) The Great MOTHER or Virgin Goddess Whether she is known as the White Goddess, Great Mother, or Virgin Isis the Great Goddess is the symbol of the archetypal Feminine. Her image is inexorably li nked to the Moon and the death-rebirth cycle. The worship of the Great Goddess was com mon in the matriarchal agricultural groups of the Mediterranean and Near East. All the later goddesses of the Greek pantheon are contained in this universal symbol of t he Earth Mother. The Goddess is associated with the vegetarian cycle and the processes of agr icultural life. She rules the domestic area of life as well as nature. Her primary chara cteristic is fertility. This fertility extends to the fecundity of imagination. This femin ine goddess is single in essence, but displays many forms. To the Egyptians, this Great Goddess was known as Isis and her worship c ontinued into the period of rulership by Imperial Rome. At this point the religion became a mystery cult. This cult is described in detail in The Golden Ass of Apuleius, w hich includes the tale Eros and Psyche which describes the psychological development of feminine c onsciousness. The initiation procedures of this mystery cult involved a voluntary ritual death an d revival. The Isis Mysteries were the same as the Eleusian Mysteries in honor of De meter/Persephone. They celebrate the immortality of the mother/daughter relationship. Isis embodies all contrasts. Like the moon, she is light and dark, life and death, beginning and end. This Great Mother is the matrix of all manifestation perceivable by man. The whole life of man is governed by the goddess, Mother of all-that-exists. Isis w orship even persists in the modern Christian world through the cult of the Virgi n Mary. Even though matriarchal consciousness characterizes the spiritual natu re of woman, it also exists in men who allow their anima consciousness to manifest. As she is the source of creative inspiration, the hunches of instinct and intuition, and th e raw life energy itself, it is an advantage for men to establish a harmony with the moon power. She counsels meditation, contemplation, waiting and watching, dreaming, and rememberin g. Matriarchal consciousness focuses around growth and transformation. In thi s mode understanding has the meaning of a \"conception\" and the metaphors of pregn ancy and birth are common. The knowledge revealed by the goddess is not one of impart ed truths but the personal experience of transformation. She encourages participat ion. When rational over-achieving ego-consciousness has run its course, quite, refle ctive lunar consciousness emerges to cool the fires of the spirit. The feminine i mage holds the keys to experience of the inner planes for both men and women. This is shown in Q abalah by the fact that the two highest paths of the Middle Pillar correspond with the Moon. She rules the transformative mysteries of initiation. As initiatrix, the Goddess progressively educates the emotions of the aspi rant. Magickal training of the image-making faculty is the beginning of a new way of using th e mind. One may become self-initiated into the Moon mysteries through careful atten tion to the stirring of subconscious memories. There is much to learn through psychology conc erning the lunar aspects of the soul.

The imaginal construction of the personified form of the sou l enables a linking between your consciousness and the subtle matter of the Gre at MOTHER's Soul. The dual nature of the Goddess is shown bu her two characters. Her ele mentary nature has both a positive (good) and negative (bad)! She is pictured either as all-embr acing protectress, or alternately as the devouring Terrible Mother. Her transfor mative nature also carries good and bad imagery. She not only governs cyclic rebirth and inspiration , but also the mysteries of intoxification, madness, and death. The negative character istics are symbolized by the Dark Moon, and the positive are symbolized by the bright Fu ll Moon. The Great Goddess appears in tandem with her Son-Lover. His death and re birth are symbolic of the cycle of the seed in the ground and the masculine counter part of divinity. She is soul. He is Spirit. The stages of the Feminine Mysteries remain valid psychological miles tones in personal experience even in modern life. The worship of the Great Goddess i nvolved a period of contemplation in her temple, religious prostitution with a man who repre sented \"masculine divinity\" in an impersonal ceremony designed so the woman experienced a surrender to her instincts. This sexual union was considered a sacred marriage, but it was a wedding which resulted in the \"death\" of her former condition. But, miracu lously, she is transformed into the pregnant Moon Mother, filled with the divine Spiri t. This magickal child grows slowly in an organic process which had its initiation at the con ception of the child. It is a process which takes place in the dark subconscious, far fr om the eyes of men. With the birth of the virgin-born child, the symbolism switches from that of sexuality to that of maternal solicitude. This birth is the woman's spiritual rebi rth of her hidden potentialities. Because of her dual nature, she does not remain exclusi vely compassionate, but turns fierce and intolerant when it comes time to sacrifice this child. What is sacrificed is her incestuous identification with him. Any man must touch upon t he depths of his own emotional intensity, not continue to require this from his mortal moth er. Each facing this emotional intensity is the second stage of initiation to the Goddess, the im personal aspect of the Feminine. The period of the Virgin's Pregnancy corresponds with Yesod. In this period she is One-In- Herself. As Virgin, she is represented by the crescent moon. She is a d ivine power in her own right. With the incorporation into her body of the masculine solar-seed, sh e embarks on Path 25, Art, which represents the harmonization of lunar and solar comp onents of the psyche. This results in the birth of the magickal child, his divinity r evealed, his demise immanent. Child, King, and Sacrificed God are all symbols of Tiphareth, Sphe re of the Resplendent Sun. Moving past Tiphareth on Path 13, The High Priestess, we are again the realm of the Virgin Goddess, but this time she confers the gifts of potential reveal ed as the Full Moon, knowledge of the unconscious as past and future.

The Syzygy: Anima and Animus In the creation myths of many cultures, Primordial Wholeness divides i nto polarized aspects. The Syzygy indicates this archetypal coupling where one aspect is n ever separated from the other. In the \"impersonal\" aspect of lunar experience, the Gr eat Goddess is never separated from her masculine Son-Lover. One implies the other for whol eness. They exemplify the soul-spirit relationship. On the \"personal\" level of lunar experience we find the tandem of anima/ animus. They are the contrasexual component each human carries within. These soul fig ures embody our latent capacities for expression and realization of the traits normally rese rved for the opposite sex. Thus, the animus leads a woman to the outer world and promotes he r ability in focused, rational thinking; the anima guides a man through the inner world s of relationship. This is the level of psychological \"complex\" where there is a blending of archetypal realities and individual experience. Thus, the imagery of anima/us is based in archetypal symbolism and in childhoo d memories of \"significant others\" of the opposite sex. This includes par ental attitudes and behavior, grandparent's influence, sibling, first love, and cultural expect ations and norms. Anima/us determines our conceptualization of the ideal mate, and is r esponsible for such phenomena as \"love at first sight,\" and \"star-crossed lovers.\" It takes th e elements of fate and destiny and combines them in a personal formula. Anima/us represents the balancing of masculine and feminine traits i n the individual. This balancing is a form of coniunctio, or sacred marriage, a union which produces t he magickal child which is the higher Self. The animus is the masculine personification of the soul. He carries b oth a transcendent spiritual aspect and a personal aspect. He is shown in the magickal symbolism of Yesod: a beautiful, naked, muscular man. On the archetypal level anima/us is equivale nt to the Taoist Yin-Yang concept, a system which embraces a non-combative play of oppos ites, a circulation of soul. Anima/us are potential guides to the depths of the unconscious, formin g a bridge to daily life. They are factors which transcend consciousness, so in a relationship which seems to have everything going for it, there can be friction (or \"animosity\") produced by unconscious for ces operating below the surface. Most of these troubles s tem from projecting the anima/us image onto our loved ones and maneuvering them into ful filling our expectations. Internal conflicts come from the split nature of ani ma/us we experience in modern life. This revolves mainly around the gulf between the Spiri tual and Sensual"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"aspects of the inner figure. A man experiences the split between h oly Mother Mary and the erotic goddess of his dreams. For example, the spiritual animus might be projected onto the figure of a w ise old man, a ghostly lover to whom a woman goes in fantasy, or an idealized brother/sister relat ionship devoid of sexual options. The sensual animus might be imaged by darker gods of impersonal sexuality, phallic or obscene. In any event, the animus represent s the woman's need for creative expression. The more fully she can manifest this trait , the better her inner relationship to the animus becomes. He provides her with inner light, not inspiration which is a function of her anima nature, core of her Self. Anima/us excite those feelings of longing, awe, fear of the unknown, and incomprehensibility. The transpersonal power of love can appear as a possess ion by another, against which rational thought has no protection. Yesod is the experi ence of this emotional-sexual level and its projections, coupled with the exercise o f discrimination between archetypal and personal. (3). ARTEMIS - Goddess of the Moon; Ephesus Queen and Huntress, chaste and fair, Now the sun is laid to sleep, Seated in thy silver chair State in wonted manner keep: Hesperus entreats thy light, Goddess excellently bright. Earth, let not thy envious shade Dare itself to interpose; Cynthia's shining orb was made Heaven to clear when day did close: Bless us then with wished sight, Goddess excellently bright. Lay thy bow of pearl apart, And thy crystal-shining quiver; Give unto the flying hart Space to breathe, how short soever: Thou that mak'st a day of night, Goddess excellently bright. Jonson's Hymn to Cynthia (Diana) from Cynthia's Revels Artemis is a form of the Great Mother, and has archaic characteristics. Sh e was worshipped throughout the Mediterranean. Her name is Oriental in origi n (Artimis). In Crete she was worshipped as Britomartis. Her other important cult si tes included Arcadia and Ephesus. The Greek cult in Arcadia considered her a Kore , like Persephone, and she was even called a daughter of Demeter. Her major cult site was in Asia Minor at Ephesus where she was worshipped as the fecund, many-breasted godde ss. In this area, she"},{"pageNumber":1040,"pageContent":"was associated with the date palm. This symbolism is retained today in certai n Tarot decks, where the High Priestess card, which corresponds with Artemis cont ains this tree. Even the advent of Christianity could not snuff out the old pagan cult. The cult of the Virgin Mary began in Ephesus and adapted much of the symbolism of the antique Artem is. Later, in Rome, she was known as Diana or Cynthia. Paradoxically, Artemis ruled over wild animals, childbirth and the young. She protected the young, including humans because she had originally been their mother. H owever, the chief attribute of Artemis is that she is Virgin and Mother, simultan eously. This attribute was especially prominent in Asia where the Olympian re ligion impressed on Greece through the Homeric Hymns was less effective in suppressin g the ancient form of worship. W herever she was worshipped, under any name, she is the All-Mother. In t he earliest Greek religion, Artemis was an earth-goddess. She may even have been parthenos, the Greek word which is usually translat ed \"virgin\". This could happen in more than one way. In the first place, there is some evidence that the word did not always nor of necessity have that meaning. It m ight mean no more than unmarried, not tied by any bonds to a male who must be acknowledged as master. There were priestesses as well as deities in pre-Gr eek and Oriental cults who lived like that, but without preserving their virgin ity. Indeed, to sacrifice her virginity might be part of a priestess's service, but she did n ot sacrifice her freedom to a male nor become his property, as marriage in early times would imply . . . It was quite commonly believed that virginity could be renewed periodically by a process of lustration . . . Later, as the more Hellenic notion of strict virgini ty prevailed, the attendant remained, but like Hippolytus, was vowed to chastity as was the goddess herself . . .At Ephesus her cult was carried on right through classical time s in the old way . (10) The Greeks adapted her paradoxical nature of dignity and abandon, uniting her c haracter with their virgin huntress, who was also a goddess of nature and wild beas ts. They could not ignore nor abolish the worship of the Great Mother with its matrilin eal customs. Her cult was by far too powerful and deeply rooted in the Mediteranean psyche. I f her agricultural rites, sexual emblems, and fertility aspects shocked the m, they nevertheless felt it necessary to amalgamate this goddess into their pantheon. Whether chast e, or a goddess of fertility, Artemis is always Virgin, or one-in-herself. Obeisance to Artemis continues within the Catholic church under the auspices of the Virgin Mary. The feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary on the fifteenth of August is derived from the great festival to Hecate the moon goddess of Greece, an d that of Diana, her descendant in Rome. Even the prayers for the preservation of the harve st from destruction by early rains are continued. Another major characteristic of Artemis is the cyclic lunar rhythm . Rhythms such as chanting, dancing, or drum beats facilitates passage from one plane to the next . It creates an altered state of consciousness. Dances in honor of Artemis were orgiast ic in character. Eliade cites the proverb: \"Where has not Artemis danced?\" as meaning that h er cult was so wide spread there were honorary dances for her everywhere."},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"Her connections with survivability are shown in her function as midwife . It is even legendary that Artemis was delivered from Leto first, and then helped her mother in the delivery of her twin, Apollo. Artemis is \"the force that sustains our attrac tion to the primitive and the unknown. She can teach us how to make contact with the u nconscious and survive. Artemis is energy: death-bringing energy, psychic energy, abund ant energy, excess energy.\" (11) Artemis is adventurous and represents the tenden cy for striking out on one's own. Sometimes this occurs in mid-life, when one seeks retreat from the city, home, and family in solitude. Artemis represents the continual renewal of \"daughter-mother- grandmother.\" As Artemis-Hekate, she oversees magic. Artemis-Hekate and Apollo share a capacity for coming powerfully from afar. When invoked, they appear in their characterist ic manner for their epiphany. An example of lunar magickal procedure is given in Aleister Crowley's exce llent occult novel, Moonchild . The magician Cyril has found a willing assistant in his efforts from a woman named Lisa. Her horoscope contains a powerful lunar influence, as his is mostly solar. A sister of the magickal order aids them both. She is a priestess of Artemis for some twenty years, and for ten of those has spoken to no man. Lisa takes her oath of dedication, and is admonished to be strong in her will an d abolish unsuitable thoughts which would disturb the gestation of the moonchi ld. Her virginity is then renewed through a rite of lustration and the rituals begin. He had set up a small triangular altar of silver; and it was upon this that Sist er C. and her disciples came thrice nightly to make their incantations. The ritual of the moon might never be celebrated during daylight . . .Upon the evening of Monday, after the adoration of the setting sun, Lisa was led to the garden. There the hand-maidens unclothed her, and washed her from head to foot in the waters of the sacred spring. Then she put upon her a solemn oath that she would follow out the rules of the ritual, not speaking to any man except her chosen, not leaving the protection of the circle, not communicating with the outer and un initiated world; but, on the other hand, devoting herself wholly to the invocation of the M oon. Then she clothed her in a specially prepared and consecrated garment; it was a l oose vestment of pale blue covered with silver tissue; and the secret sigils of the moon were woven cunningly upon its hem. It was frail but of great volume; and the effec t was that the wearer seemed to be wrapped in a mist of moonlight. What was the incantation like? We may well imagine it was one of fervor and madne ss of things chaste, remote, and inscrutable. \"With the speed of a huntress th e shape neared her, hid the moon from her, and she perceived the buskined Artemis, si lver- sandaled, with her bright bow and quiver of light. Leaping behind her... Artemis was worshipped as Luna in Heaven, and invoked in Tartarus as Hecat e. She avoided the society of men, and retired to the woods accompanied by her nymphs . She was armed with her bow of light and carried a torch kindled by the lighteni ng of Zeus, so she could pursue the swift stag. The high mountains were said to tremble at t he twang of her"},{"pageNumber":1042,"pageContent":"bow, and the forests resounded with the panting of the wounded dee r. After the chase, Artemis would hasten to Delphi, residence of her brother Apollo, wher e she would hang her bow and quiver upon his altar, and begin to dance. What does Artemis mean to a modern woman, and what are her psychological values which persist throughout time? The chief characteristic of the goddess in her crescent phase is th at she is virgin. Her instinct is not used to capture or possess the man whom she attracts. Sh e does not reserve herself for the chosen man who must repay her by his devotion, nor is her in stinct used to gain for herself the security of husband, home, and family. . .She is essent ially one-in- herself. In the image of the Mother Goddess--ancient and powerful--women of ol den times found the reflection of their own deepest feminine nature...Today, the goddess is no longer worshipped...But the law or power of which she was but the personificat ion is unabated in its strength and life-giving potency. It is we who have changed. We have given our allegiance too exclusively to masculine forces. Today, however, through a religious cult, not even with a conscious knowledge of what they are doing, but through a change in psychological attitude. For that principle, which in ancient and more naive days was projected into the form of a goddess, is no longer seen in the guise of a religiou s tenet but is now sensed as a psychological force arising from the unconscious, having, as had th e Magna Dea of old, power to mold the destinies of mankind. (12) (4). THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES (Demeter/Persephone, Isis, and Psyche) The establishment of the Eleusinian Mysteries is related in the Ho meric Hymn to Demeter. After the abduction of her daughter Persephone, the mourning Demete r traveled to Eleusis (near Athens), and took refuge by the Well of the Maidens. She demanded that the local inhabitants build her a sanctuary there. A fter she was reunited with her daughter, she revealed her rites, and began teachin g her Mysteries, including the cultivation of wheat. The early history of the cult reports two types of initiations. One was conc erned with the reunion of the goddesses; the other concerned the possibility of man's immortalization. The Great Goddess has always been considered able to grant immortality to hum ans, but early initiates to the Eleusinian Mysteries were not granted immortal ity, but experienced revelations which assured the soul a blissful existence after death. Eliade recounts how the symbolic death of Persephone had great consequen ces for mankind: \"As the result of it, an Olympian and benevolent goddess temporar ily inhabited the kingdom of the dead. She had annulled the unbridgeable distance bet ween Hades and Olympus. Mediatrix between the two divine worlds, she could thereaft er intervene in the destiny of mortals.\" (13)"},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"Archaeologists established the colonization of Eleusis occurred in th e fifteenth century. The Mysteries were celebrated for nearly 2,000 years. Because of social and cultural changes during this period, the Mysteries altered over time. The Lesser Mysteries were celebrated in the spring, and formed a pr eliminary probation period for the Greater Mysteries conducted in the Autumn (Sept. -Oct.). Initiation was open to both men and women, providing they spoke Greek, had killed no fellow man, and h ad passed through the Lesser Mysteries. The rites involved processions, sacrifices, dances, and songs. There were al so secret rites in the Greater Mysteries, which remain shrouded in darkness to this day. The revelations must have been profound, for no initiate ever revealed them. A third stage of initiation was open to those who had been initiates for a year. It culminated in a supreme vi sion, the nature of which we may only guess. Attempts at reconstructing the rites have been made, but only fragments are available. Included were ritual fasting and imbib ing of the sacred drink, or kykeon. What is known is that, after a sacramental meal (which coul d represent a sacred marriage like communion), the final vision took place in a dazzling li ght, and included an invocation of Kore. The Eleusinian Mysteries opened a new religious dimension for the Me diterranean world. Through them, the initiate perceived a continuity between life and de ath. It opened speculations concerning the underworld which were suppressed by the predominant Olympian religion. Demeter/Persephone became the most popular of Greek goddesses dur ing this period, and initiation into her cult, guaranteed a sort of \"adoption\" by her. A major character istic of the cult which became paradigmatic for most other Mystery cults was th e strict emphasis on silence and secrecy. Thereafter, it became stylish for Masters to reveal their secrets only to their initiates. The Egyptian Mysteries of Isis and Osiris: In the 3rd Century B.C. Ptolemy Soter sought to consolidate his rule through th e acceptance of a supreme divinity by both Egyptians and Greeks. He exalted Sarap is (a derivative of Osiris) and Isis. Herodotus assimilated these gods into the G reek Mysteries, where Isis was identified with the Great Mother, Demeter, and Osi ris was the initiated individual who attained \"salvation.\" For the Greeks, Osiris was also iden tified with Dionysus, who was also killed, dismembered, then resurrected. Qabalistically, a Great Goddess like Isis has many attributes which have var ious correspondences, depending on the level of involvement. Aleister Crow ley has determined several of these: ...a goddess like Isis might be given to Zero as conterminous with Nature, to 3 as Mother, to 4 as Venus, to 6 as Harmony, to 7 as Love, to 9 as the Moon, to 10 as Virgin, to 13 again as the Moon, to 14 as Venus, to 15 as connected with the letter He, to 16 as the Sacred Cow, to 18 as the Goddess of Water, to 24 as Draco, to 28 as Giver of Rain, to 29 as the Moon, and to 32 as Lady of the Mysteries (Saturn, Binah) . (14)"},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"In the Hellenistic period, the Mysteries of Isis provided a ritual re birth as its central purpose. The object was for the initiate to become Osiris, raised from t he dead by the magical power of the goddess Isis. Accounts of these mysteries are found i n both Plutarch's Isis and Osiris, and The Golden Ass of Apuleius. After fasting and meditation, the mystes took part in a mystery drama where h e personified Set, or Typhon in the form of a red ass. He was tormented, and his lust and desirousness transformed through fully experiencing his instinctu al nature. The deep religious intensity of the aspirant produces transformation and the ide ntification with the dead Osiris. He journeys to Hades and sees the midnight Sun shining brigh tly, as well as the pantheon of Gods celestial and infernal. After this ritual death, he is raised by the power of Isis. Plutarch also identified Isis with Athena, in that th e ever-changing veil of nature includes both growth and decay. The Isis of Hellenistic times, as Nature and the Moon, was creator, moth er, nurse, and destroyer, just like Demeter. She also embodied Wisdom, or Sophia; Osiris was Knowledge, Reason, and Logos. Through acceptance by Isis, the initiate caught in the instin ctual level of passion and lust, is raised to a spiritual life. The initiate believed the goddess Isis could prolong life beyond the te rm fixed by Destiny, or fate. But this process involved a metamorphosis by undergoing a voluntary, ritu al death in order to obtain one's spiritual birthday. Like the Eleusinian Mysteries, the first great public festival of Isis took place in Spring, when the Mediterranean navigation season opened. The second, the lament ation for and reanimation of Osiris took place October 29 to November 1. The seeker Apuleius recounts his initiation, after abstaining from meat and wine for ten days: Thou wouldst peradventure demand, thou studious reader, what was said and done there: verily I would tell thee if it were lawful for me to tell: thou w ouldst know if it were convenient for thee to hear . . . Howbeit I will not long torment thy mi nd, which peradventure is somewhat religious and given to some devotion; listen ther efore and believe it to be true. Thou shalt understand that I approached near unto Hell, ev en to the gates of Proserpine, and after that I was ravished throughout all the eleme nts, I returned to my proper place: about midnight I saw the sun brightly shine, I saw likewise the gods celestial and infernal, before whom I presented myself an d worshipped them . (15) In the Egyptian Mysteries of antiquity, the Pharaoh was identified with O siris after his death. But, through these Hellenistic initiations, the living individu al became \"Divinized,\" through the powers of the Goddess. Isis and Osiris are exalted to the rank of universal divinities of the highest plane, covering psychic space from the unde rworld to ascent to celestial heights. This Hellenistic interpretation of the old Egyp tian cults reflects a \"monotheistic\" universalism typical of other suffering gods, includin g Dionysus and Orpheus. This Hellenistic mystery theology expresses the deepest E gyptian religious genius."},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"In recounting the tale of his experiences as an initiate, Apuleius inse rts the tale of Psyche and Eros into his personal story. An evaluation of the meaning of this tale in the development of his relationship to his anima brings out the psychological value of these initiatory sequences. In the tale, Eros represents the reproductive p assion, which is transformed through its relationship with Psyche. Psyche is an incarna ted form of Eros' mother, Venus. Since she is mortal, she represents that part of Eros' ani ma which is closer to consciousness. Venus was jealous of Psyche because mortals began worshi pping her beauty, preferring her to an abstract Olympian goddess. In Amor und Psyche, the author Merkelbach points up an identification between Psyche and Isis, and Venus and Isis. One might think that the goddess, then, figh ts against herself. In a sense, she does. She protests because of the narrowing of her potential in a mortal form. Therefore, if Psyche is Venus in diminutive form, Eros actually take s part in a sacred marriage with his mother-daughter-sister. This repeats the old Egypti an formula. Psyche is a form of Kore, the mother goddess in rejuvenated, human form. Therefore, the Eros and Psyche tale is a variation of the Demeter-Kore myth. For the female initiate, this myth represents the deepest experi ence of the female mysteries of the Self. For the male initiate, it means a progressive integration of the anima which then leads to an experience of the Self. While he is still mother-complex ed, all the forms of the goddess are compounded in the figure of the Great Mother, and he is her ete rnal lover. Venus is a synthetic term for feminine Deity, and includes aspects of Hestia, Demeter, Cybele, Isis, etc. The symbols overlap. This is because the life of woman is d ivisible into three primary forms: 1) Virginity, 2) Wife and Mother, and 3) Old Woman, or Hag. The Goddess Hecate combined all these forms in a tripartate representat ion. She is shown as an amalgamation of three goddesses: Kore, Demeter, and Hecate the Witch. Hec ate corresponds explicitly with the Moon and its cyclic phases. Phase 1 includes Artemis, Atlanta, Persephone, Hebe, Pallas Athena, and th e virgin Sibyls. Phase 2 includes Venus, Demeter, and Cybele as well as Artemis of the Ep hesians. Phase 3 expresses the dark, malignant nature of the moon. Marie Von Franz describes the meaning of Psyche in the process of indivi duation. \" If we look at it from man's unconscious and what it means to him, the figure of Psyc he seems understandable. She is the anima which we call the derivative of the mother image. The anima image of a man is generally close to his mother's image and his anima always has s ome characteristics of his mother complex, and is closer to consciousness th an the mother archetype, in which he can integrate his experience of the female within and outside himself. It is his pattern of behavior to the feminine .\" (16) With a positive mother complex, a man is a puer eternus (eternal son) and a Don Juan-type lover of women. He lives in a strange fantasy of eternity, feeling someday he will be a great man, but never quite making it. With a negative mother-complex, the Don Ju an can never deal with women as they really are since he is naive. He has not matured into th e realization that there is a divine and banal side to love relationships. Thi s paradox must be accepted. Venus is the mother-anima; Psyche is the anima uncontami nated by one's maternal image."},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"Venus, in her jealousy, sets several tasks for Psyche. The one which links h er most closely to the Demeter/Persephone myth is her descent to Hades to get the box of beauty ointment for Venus. (Chapter 7, Tiphareth recounts the tale in more detail). Psy che is sent to Kore- Persephone who is a variation of Venus-Isis in her underworld aspect. S he opens the box, and tries to secure the special \"Beauty\" for herself. This means the man's anima equates beauty with goodness, or he can't believe a beautiful woman is capable of wick edness. This is the old naiveté again, desiring a real woman to enact his anima projections. Psyc he falls into a death-like sleep of unconsciousness...she is not \"her-self.\" And Eros must come save her. But it is a transformed Eros who appears for her. The Greeks correspond ed Eros with Osiris, who taught men and women genuine mutual love. Eros is now a psychol ogical symbol of the Self. But just at this point, Eros spirits Psyche off to Olympu s, which means the initiate in THE GOLDEN ASS OF APULEIUS is not ready for the deep r eligious experience of the higher Self. Further transformations of the man's relationship with his anima are r equired before he can experience the final Isis initiations. In these, Osiris is the s ecret ruler of the underworld, or a personification of the collective unconscious. He is muc h more than a simple vegetation-god. When he is reborn as the Horus-child, he represents restored wholen ess or totality. In QBL, Osiris is corresponded with Tiphareth, and he is the secret s piritual goal of the Isis Mysteries. Transformation from Yesod to Tiphareth occurs through the thr ee initiations of the process. This passage from one psychic state to another produces a uni fication of the personality. It is produced through the image of one all-embracing Goddess. Is is is the symbol of the Self in feminine form. A religious experience must be accepted in its totality, and therefor e is lived as a lifestyle, publicly. But this does not imply telling one's inner secrets to ever yone, producing inflation. The Self counsels one on the hiding or exposing of secrets. The secret Self, Osiris, underwent various transformations becoming most important in the Hellenistic era. His conscious religious attributes increased and he became identified with the reborn human soul. The soul tends to fragment into several autonomous part s. Isis is the only divinity which keeps her unity. She is an emotional and feeli ng experience of totality which leads the way to conscious individuation. But one must beco me more than an intellectually interested philosopher, flirting with every syst em and mystical cult which comes one's way. This will not transform the divine inner nucleus. Isis is the guide to the experience of oneness. The psyche is the only real ity known through immediate experience. Isis gives meaning to suffering, and initiates the healing process. Man's fate is similar to that of Osiris. The religious pattern revealed in the mysteries was that first comes the realization of the anima (Isis, Yesod) and then of th e higher Self (Osiris, Tiphareth). A positive relationship to the goddess produced psychological t ransformation in earthly life, which produced immortality analogous to that of the philosop her's stone or \"diamond body.\""},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"The initiate Lucius-Apuleius returns to Rome, but has a dream whic h leads him to seek initiation into the mystery cult of Osiris.

Secondary Progressions in Astrology"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"Secondary progressions are extremely easy to calculate with your natal chart and an Ephemeris for the year of your birth. Simply look up the day of your birth, then count forward one day for each year of life . This conforms to the formula for secondary progressions 1 day = 1 year. This is an arbitrary, but useful, concept. Progressions measure changes in the relationship of the earth to the Sun. Thus, the first few months of life form an analogy to the unfolding of an i ndividual. For example, say you are born at noon on August 1. If you are now 35, and wish to examine your secondary progressions, count forward in the Ephemeris 35 days to Sept 5 of you r birth year. Calculate the chart by using the positions of the planets. Pay particular attention to the new position of the progressed sun. Your s un has changed quality as you have aged from Leo to Virgo. Dane Rudhyar says the progressed sun depic ts the \"process of personality-integration\" which carries on after birth . This maturing process of personality-integration\" which carries on after birth. This maturing process leads to fullness of personality. The moon will change its sign in secondar y progressions also. Mercury may change signs every 30 years or so, but the other planets will not c hange radically over a lifetime. They may, however, change their house positions, marking important life changes in personality or collective adaptation. All planets in progressed charts indicate systems involved in co-operating with the solar process of fulfillment. Sun=integrative Will (personality fulfillment) Moon=outer, concrete changes (cyclic phases of life) Mercury=Attitude of mind to the Great Work of the Sun Venus=emotional responses Mars=power of spontaneous initiative Jupiter=balancing, soul-revealing aspect of psyche Saturn=lengthy transformative process changing structure of consciousn ess Uranus=sudden, transforming effect of subcon. processes Neptune=dissolving of limits imposed by ego (metamorphosis) Pluto=possible death/rebirth experience Each degree of the zodiac has a special symbol (Sabian Symbol) which may be contemplated during the year of the Sun's sojourn in that degree. Consult D ane Rudhyar's Astrological Mandala for these symbols and their meanings in psychic deve lopment. Also, check the aspects of the Progressed chart, and read these as you would for a natal chart. The effect is simply more short-lived. b. The Moon and the Lunation Cycle in Astrology"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"The luminous Moon has fascinated mankind throughout the ages. It is the focal point for lovers and lunatics, alike. Basically, the moon symbolizes a feminine, recepti ve attitude, and an emotional, fluctuating attitude. Negatively, the moon can indicate moodin ess, and changeability. Astrologically, the moon is as significant as the Sun, or Ascendant. It is given greater weight than the other planets, because its influence is felt so strongl y in all aspects of life. As the moon moves through its 28 day cycle, it passes through several phases whic h define its ever-cycling relationship with the sun. Most people are familiar wi th the distinctions known as new moon, full moon, and quarter moon. There is really no such phase as hal f- moon, since half the moon is synonymous with full moon. Remember, the moon only s hows 1/2 herself to us on earth; her other half remains hidden in dark shadows . Astrologers distinguish even finer distinctions in the phases of th e moon. These angular relationships to the sun are precisely defined. 1st quarter = 0 to 90 waxing degr ees; 2nd quarter = 90 - 180 degrees; 3rd quarter = 180 to 90 waning degrees; 4th quarter = 90 to Dark of the Moon. In addition, there is a Gibbous Moon, which is a day or two before an d after Full Moon. For Magickal purposes, the new moon is not equivalent to \"the dark of the moon.\" But actually begins when the crescent moon shows itself (waxing). All oper ations for psychological development are done during the 2 wks. of the waxing period, sinc e a waning moon is considered to dissipate one's magickal effectiveness. Robert Hand has described the core meaning of the Moon as an astrological influ ence: Yin: Container, medium, environment, matrix, womb, mothering, home; s ubjects as opposed to their rulers. One's Ultimate Source; the Great Mother; person al past, childhood, heritage, family, heredity, homeland; unconscious assumptions and attitudes, instincts, hereditary mental patterns, psychological patterns due to infantile experiences, emotional reflexes or programs, psychic perceptions . (1) The moon's placement indicates either feelings of belonging (positive) or alienation (negative). We are contained by the formative principle of the universe, and our adaptation to our environment reflects in our personalities. Understanding of our lunar aspects, which are largely unconscious, comes through feelings and emotions. Emotions function like reflexes, and are barely influenced by logical thou ght processes. In this manner, they function like instincts. Many psychics describe th eir perception of information as a \"feeling\" or awareness. They are in touch with the continuu m where \"all is one.\" This sensitivity to connectedness is a lunar quality. The moon symbolizes patient waiting, or \"creative submission\" to the fulf illment promised by cyclic processes. It is as important and effective as the sun, but in a le ss-obvious and obtrusive manner. The influence of the moon reflects into daily life, fo rming the matrix of personal and collective history. Through its ability to calm or incite the em otions, it influences the course of events on a grand scale. It influences behavior as m uch as the logical thought processes of solar-consciousness."},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"c. Luna and the Albedo in Alchemy Luna represents the feminine aspect of the arcane substance. As we have se en, she is linked to salt, to \"white sulphur,\" to silver, to the albedo, the feminine alba of the coniunctio. She represents the cold, moist, corporeal, receptive but not at al l inert feminine principle in the psyche, and appears as sister, mother, and bride of Sol. s he is the \"vessel\" of the sun, receiving and pouring out the powers of heaven, extr acting the energy of Sol as a power springing into eternal life. She provides that sense of se rene undulating movement, like the moon's path on the night sea, and that gentle and serene and soothing nocturnal light that enables us to see in the dark, when the sun's power has set. When Luna is at her fullness - at the plenilunum - she sta nds as the nocturnal complement to masculine diurnal consciousness. --Robert Grinnell/ Alchemy in a Modern Woman The Albedo is that stage of the alchemical work which is a phase of \"whiten ing\" and \"lightening\" after the black depressive phase of the Nigredo. It is the emergence of the feminine aspect of the Self or Holy Guardian Angel. the Albedo presages the flowering of fulfillment. Moonlight indicates that state of consciousness where one begins to react emotionally to unconscious contents. In this phase elusive intuitions and spiritual potential are made manifest. Corresponding with Yesod, the Albedo is the first goal of the alchemical wor k, reuniting a world divided into \"mind\" vs. \"matter\" through the medium of psychic re ality. Relevant symbols include the madonna, bride, moon, dawn, and dove. Experience and experiencer no longer matter as the \"images that yet/fresh images beget\" release one from the nigredo of personal identity into the mirrors of im personal reflections. This second whiteness is also not mere ignorance, a disregardi ng insouciance of the world and its ways, which results from psychic realit ies taking precedence over more earth-bound perception that attempts to resolve psychic difficulties either away from the world or into the world. Albedo prefers ne ither introversion nor extroversion, since the differences between soul and th ing no longer matter, that is , are no longer imagined in the material terms of the nigre do. . .the albedo is not only a state between but a condition per se . (2) Hillman calls this lunar stage of the albedo \"the emergence of psychological c onsciousness, the ability to hear psychologically, and to perceive fantasy creating reality.\" It is this sense: that all occurrences must first be imagined, that they begin as images, that the very cycle through which anything turns, including ourselves, is a ps ychological process, that soul fantasies are the ground and seed in all we think and do, w ant and fear. . .the subtleties of soul are embodied in the mundus imaginalis by primor dial persons, eternal archons, angelic essences who offer human consciousness a groundin g in hierarchical principles, enabling a human being to recognize what is ess ential, what comes first, and what is of lasting worth.

Some Thoughts on the Phenomena of Astral Project ion SOME THOUGHTS ON THE PHENOMENA OF ASTRAL PROJECTION By Richard Alan Miller, Physicist. 1974 The phenomena known as Astral Projection or Out-Of-The-Body Experie nce (OOBE) has become increasingly important to the research direction and study of th e paranormal. An Out-Of-The-Body Experience is now defined as one in which the subj ect appears to view the external world from some position other than that of his or her physical bod y. Traditionally in the field of Parapsychology Out-Of-The-Body Experiences are grouped into two main types, 'parasomatic' and 'asomatic'. The parasomatic type of experie nce is that in which the subject appears to himself to be located in a duplicate body, more or less resembling his physical body. In the second type of experience, the asomat ic, the subject does not appear to himself to be associated with a body, rather he or she is just a disembodied consciousness or a 'pin-point of presence'. It is important at this point to consider the definition used. Namely, onc e a structure or classification is structured, the way in which the data is gathered imm ediately sets up limits in which the phenomena can be studied. It would seem almost unnecess ary to point out that the \"mystical tradition\" underlying most of the major religions have cert ain similarities. In surveying these coincidentals, the phenomena of astral projection is one of the most overt. Psychical phenomena exert a strong influence on the foundation of religiou s heritage. The appearance of astral projection among them is probably the most common of the var ious genres. As an allusion to Dr. Robert Crookall's classic, Study and Practice of As tral Projection, the late Professor Hornell Hart states: \"Initiates into an cient mystery cults clearly included the deliberate production of astral projection. . .Catholi c saints and Quaker ministers have reported undergoing such projection.\" The Egypti an script Peret- emheru speaks of the Ba and Ka (often incorrectly thought to be analogous to each oth er), which are ancient suggestions of what we call the astral and fluidic bodi es, respectively. Qabbalism also has a parallel. In the Zohar, reference to the silvery \"astral cord \" is made. Referring to this allusion, A.E. Waite writes: \"When the good soul is prepar ing to leave this world, and while it is suspended from the body only at the larynx, it behold s three angels to whom it must confess its sins.\" Even Christianity is not exempt from this phenomena. St. Paul's description of the astral body and the Old Testament reference to the astral body are classics (1 Cor. 15:44, and Ecclesiastes 12:6), and the appearance of Peter's d ouble before Rhoda may be found in Acts 12:14-17 (A.V., King James version). One of the most significant esoteric scripts discussing astral projec tion is the Bardo Thodol, somewhat incorrectly translated as the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The Bard o Thodol states that the initiate, during the altered state of consciousness, can produce mind-body separation. This seems to have a bearing on those prolific instances where L SD voyagers (who experience a journey very close to the bardo trip as described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead) appear to have such projection experiences. One such inciden t was related to the"},{"pageNumber":1052,"pageContent":"author by an LSD user who, during the trip, discovered that his consciousn ess was not in his body, but next to it. The most asked question about the out-of-body experience is: How does one k now that they are simply not dreaming? A more fundamental question to ask, however, would be to counter-question: How does one know that the waking experience is real? T o answer the first: the subjective out-of-body-experiences differ from the typ ical dream state principally in the following ways: 1) There is continuity of some sort of conscious awareness. 2) Intellectual and/or emotional decisions are made during the experien ce. 3) Multivalued perceptions occur via sensory inputs or their equivalents . 4) There is a non-recurrence of identical patterns. 5) The experience of time duration, based on long-term memory. The most certain statement that can be made by the subject is that wh en the condition exists, he/she is as aware of \"not dreaming\" as when he/she is awake. Dr. Robert Crookall has advanced a theory linking astral projection to survival. He agre es with Professor Hart that the survival of the human personality after death i s nothing more than the permanent projection of the astral body. He sees various degrees of p rojection involving two distinct portions of the human psyche. One, he sates, is consciou s but immaterial. The other portion is unconscious and, although immaterial, has some objective existence. In OOBE either or both of these portions may be projected. Dr. Crookall's beliefs have some interesting parallels in the Ba and Ka conc epts of the ancient Egyptians. They believed that the Ka was a \"double\" of the individual and that is was composed of very tenuous matter. It was supposed to live for some time after death and both the process of embalming and various funerary practice were inten ded to ensure that it lived on in the tomb. If the required practices were neglecte d the Ka was thought to emerge from the tomb to haunt those responsible. The Ba was the soul of the Egyptians. It was conscious but immaterial. In li fe it was contained within the Ka. In death it left both the Ka and the body. There is s ome scientific evidence to support this concept. Dr. Duncan McDougall of Haverhill, Mass. ar ranged to have dying patients placed on a sensitive weighing apparatus. He found that th ere was a weight loss of from two to two-and-a-half ounces at the moment of death. The data could not be explained except in terms of something having left the body. Two Dutch Physicists, Dr. J.L.W.P. Matla and Dr. G.L. Zaalberg Van Zelst report similar observations and data. They further reported that the proposed \"astral body\" appears to have a speci fic weight of 12.24 mg., that it responds to gravitation, and that it appears to be composed of partic les that are small, heavy, but very widely separated. Dr. Charles Tart, University of California at Davis has been conducting bio -physical measurements on individuals who can astrally project at will. His rese arch indicates that"},{"pageNumber":1053,"pageContent":"out-of-body-experiences occur in conjunction with a non-dreaming, non-aw ake brain wave stage characterized by predominate slowed alpha activity from the brain and no activation of the autonomic nervous system. OOB experiences seem to occur during a rat her poorly developed Stage 1 pattern of sleep which was dominated by alphoid activity and of ten mixed with transitory periods of wakefulness. This alphoid activity was al ways one to one- and-a-half cycles per second lower than normal alpha rhythm. There seems to b e also no REM (rapid eye movement) accompanying these experiences. It is concl uded that it is in the hypnagogic state where OOB experiences occur. There is one sleep study by Drs. Lester and Guerrero-Figueroa in which c onsiderable alphoid activity was reported in the sleep records as a result of chlorproma zine administration. Chlorpromazine is a fairly commonly used tranquilizer kn own under the trade name of Thorazine. It is now being speculated that drugs which tend to slow alpha frequency might promote OOB experiences, and this could be a possibl e fruitful line of experimental inquiry. The author has experimented with a number of available legal herbs and foun d that Jimson weed when smoked works quite well for inducing OOB experie nces with persons untrained in the technique. Care must be taken with this herb as it belongs to the Datura or night shade family. The active constituents are scopolamine, atropine, h yocyamine and other tropanes. If ingested, as reported by numerous Indian tribes of the S outhwest, the herb can be quite toxic. It is recommended that only one to two grams be smoke d at one time and prolonged use is not recommended. The herb has also been called thorn-apple or loco weed. Religion has been defined in terms of a commitment to something beyond t he self (Garnett, 1942). Thus, the religious experience can be one of man's most meaningful li fe adventures. This powerful and profound experience is often associated with level s of awareness similar to those aspects of human existence perceived as \"creative\", \"religious\" , \"mystical\", and/or \"paranormal.\" The Western world has institutionalized religion and has codified r eligious dogma while neglecting religious experience. This neglect has many roots, among them w ould be Plant's emphasis on reason to the near exclusion of feeling, Aristotle's division of philosophy into science and metaphysics, St. Augustine's separation of the \"body\" from the \"mind\", as well as Descarte's division of man's inner life from his outer life. These divisions run counter to reports of the religio-mystic experien ce which, at its most profound, involves the subjective feelings of an integration of man's total b eing with the universe about him. Dr. Krippner and Dr. Ullman at the Maimonides Dream L aboratory have indicated the feasibility of experimentally inducing dream pattern s telepathically. They indicate that a person sleeping is open to impressions and thoughts of others about that person, that these impressions can be and are incorporated into the m ain body of the dream experience. Daily experience touches on various unresolved conflicts from one's past, arou sing unconscious feelings and wishes and memories to a preconscious level. Dreaming integrates and again makes unconscious the aroused feelings, wishes and memories from the past,"},{"pageNumber":1054,"pageContent":"along with those aspects of the recent experiences which have stimulate d or touched upon the material from the past. In the dream process, each person uses his characteristic defense to deal with the particular aroused feelings and impulses. If the new experiences are growth-promoting in nature, i.e., correct previous distorted wishes or fears, a modification in ways of dealing with the previously unconscious material may result when the dream brings the new experience into relation to the past. Thus, dre ams can be used to predict future events in that they program attitudes and behavior patt erns. In light of the above, a new model for the nature of consciousness begins to deve lop. Astral projection apparently requires an altered state of consciousness simi lar to Stage 1 of sleep. There also appears to be some very subtle but important differences bet ween Stage 1 of sleep ahd that required for an OOB experience. Those differences can b e discussed physiologically, vis. the EEG, the tape recorder, the rating scale, statistical p rocedures and the like. However, with some of the new research available, the concept that the brain is a transducer of information becomes useful. Dr. Gowan's work at the University of California at Northridge on the Collecti ve Preconscious indicates that there is a possible body of information or knowl edge which is available with slight adjustments in tuning, or alteration of consciousne ss. This concept could be applied to such ideas as pre-natal memory, language and other observed paranormal phenomena. This body of information is a universal one which doe s not require a time/space co-ordinate system, rather it functions on a mor e holistic level as the dream telepathy studies might indicate. Astral projection appears to r equire a state of consciousness which does not use a space/time co-ordinate system. Rath er, OOB experiences are those where space and time are not critical for the ass imilation of information. The point seems to go back to the occult concept that your awaren ess is everywhere, but your consciousness is a limited or special case of awarenes s. Astral projection is apparently a special case of ESP (extra-sensory percep tion) where the information is brought into consciousness via certain special co-ordinate s, i.e., OOB experiences. The real point is that the information was already present b ut needed some mechanism to be experienced on a conscious level. The development of those mechanisms over other possible ones available form the new field called Noetic scienc es. The real issue or question which now arises is: Why have we chosen a particular co-ordinate system over another to call this system a \"normal\" astral projection, religio-mystical expe rience, and dream state as deviant from a \"normal\" state may hold the key to another stage in the development of Man. b. Ritual Timing and Seasonal Tides According to Magickal tradition, there are times for planning and times for d oing. To obtain optimal effects in any working, the magician cooperates with various ti des. This amplifies his effectiveness. This is not a fantasy of \"control\", but a mat ter of fine-tuning one's work through development of responsiveness to patterns. When one make s use of various \"astral currents\" one \"goes with the flow\", so to speak. There are three major types of current to which magickal effectivene ss is subject. These include the Solar cycle of seasonal change, which is of annual duration; the lunar or"},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"monthly cycle is approximately 28 days long; and the circadian cycle of geomagnetic forc es which influence individual behavior. Solar Cycle: The equinoxes, as most people know, are times of equal day and night (when each ar 12 hours long). More precisely, they are defined as the two imaginary points in the heavens where the celestial equator intersects the plane of the ecli ptic. The plane of the ecliptic is an imaginary plane extending through the center of the Sun, t he orbit of the Earth, and beyond to the band of the Zodiac. It is therefore the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere. Th e celestial equator is an extension on the celestial sphere of the Earth's equator. Since the Ear th's axis is inclined 23 1/2 degrees, the celestial equator is inclined 23 1/2 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. At two points they intersect: the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are the time s of equal day and night. The great religious holy days of all faiths tend to cluster around the times of these equilibrated periods. Why? It is not known, but traditionally there is t he belief in \"tides\" which flow through an unseen ether or medium, known variously as pran a, or the astral light. As the Earth revolves on its axis, and also travels at the same time aroun d the sun, centers of stress are set up in the electromagnetic sphere of the e arth (this includes the effect of solar winds on the ionosphere and gravitational forces influenc ing the earth). On any part of the earth's surface, a positive current flows from East to West, i n the Astral Light. So, there is a steady current, or tide, in the magnetic field of the ear th which is linked to coreolis force. This coreolis force is known to effect individu al organisms. As the earth moves around the sun, a magnetic current passes from the nor th to the south during six months, then reverses flowing from south to north for the remain ing six months. The \"seasonal\" solar tides are the most powerful influence on magickal wor k, and are classified as follows: The Tide of Sowing: March 21 (Vernal Equinox) - June 21 This is the time to begin new projects; goal oriented. The Tide of Reaping: June 21 (Summer Solstice) - Sept. 23 One receives the material rewards of the last cycle. The Tide of Planning: Sept.23 (Autumnal Equinox) - Dec. 23 One experiences the spiritual results of what is sown. The Tide of Destruction: Dec. 23 (Winter Solstice) - March 21 Old forms are broken up; time for study, introspection, meditation, cont emplation, magical retirement period. Throughout history, the vernal equinox has been considered a time of rebirth ; the resurrection of vegetation by the life-giving warmth of the Sun signifie s new beginning...Spring. It is considered to be the most significant seasonal c hange in its impact biologically, psychologically, and sociologically. \"Spring fever\" can be considere d a psychological repercussion of the biological surge in growth hormones in the human body."},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"Whole societies undergo tremendous change during these periods. What biologi cal mechanism can account for this change? The answer may lie in the study of the pineal gland, also referred to as the \"t hird eye.\" The pineal gland was found to produce a chemical neurotransmitter called serotonin (similar in structure to LSD-25), according to a regular oscillating beat, the basis of th is beat being the so-called circadian rhythm. It has been found that the pineal responds s omehow to environmental light conditions, and that by altering light conditions one can extend, contract, or even stabilize the chemical production rhythms of the pin eal. The fact that the pineal responds to light, even if this response is ind irect via the central nervous system, has some fascinating and far-reaching conceptual application s. There are many behavioral changes which overtake animals as the seasons change, and which can be produced out-of-season in the laboratory by stimulating the appropriate span of artificial daylight. Do such seasonal changes in mood and behavior persist in humans? As indicated before, the great religious holy days seem to cluster around t he 4 great divisions of the solstices and equinoxes. Is it possible that the human pi neal gland (which is considered by some merely an atrophied relic of the past) still respon ds to these alterations in the length of daylight? Changing the balance of neurohormones in the brain may perhaps effect a greater incidence of psychedelic states (mind-exp ansive altered states of consciousness) in certain susceptible individuals just at these c rucial times. This possibility provides an entirely new approach to our secular understanding of the reli gious experience, at least as it is mediates through biological factors. The pineal gland has thus been referred to as a kind of biological clock, one which acts as a kind of coupling system perhaps maintaining phase relations within a mu lti-oscillator system; a phase coordinator for multiple biorhythms. The pineal is a \"cosm ic eye\"; it is aware of celestial rhythms not observed by the normal eye, like seasonal and lun ar changes rather than daily ones. It helps manipulate the body's chemistry in harmony w ith seasonal changes. Serotonin can be seen as the \"intensity knob\" of the brain. As the l evel of serotonin increases, so does the level of activation of the cortex. Equinoxes and solstices are symbols of the Death/Rebirth archetypes f rom individual to cultural levels. The concept of world changes in outlook and sociology from Age t o Age is derived from the phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes. The voli tion of consciousness from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius may be even a m ore subtle manipulation of this pineal gland, the so-called \"third eye.\" A good meditation for the Vernal Equinox was expressed by Dane Rudhyar when he stated: \"Every li ving whole is a chord of relationships. The resonance of this chord is what we call 'cons ciousness'.\" Lunar Phases: New Moon-perform no magick during the dark of the moon. Fi rst Quarter concerns impregnation, inception of projects and growth, or gestation. The Full Moon contains the greatest magickal power, especially in the fall with harve st moon. Waning Quarter Phase is less powerful and is for internalization. Circadian Rhythms: Produced through the interaction of geomagnetic for ces with the individual.

HOD Title: Hod, Glory Magical Image: A Hermaphrodite Position on the Tree: At the base of the Pillar of Severity Yetziratic Text: The Eighth Sephira is called the Absolute or Perfec t Intelligence because it is the mean of the Primordial, which has no root by which it can cleav e or rest, save in the hidden places of Gedulah, fr om which emanate its proper essence.

It lies at the base of the Pillar of Severity, and indicat es a mode of self-expression. This is in direct contrast to its balancing Sphere, Netzach, at the base of the Pilla r of mercy, which exemplifies the action of the non-ego. Since this Sphere is corresponded with Hermes, or M ercury, the roots of this mode of self-expression a re found in Hermetic Philosophy. Though the oldest ext ant texts of popular Hermetism date back to the Thi rd Century B.C., its roots may be far older. Hermetic philosophy seems to have developed in Egypt, and it s mythology supports this view. The god, known as Hermes in the Hellenistic period, was call Thoth in ancient Egypt. He is patron of s ciences, writing, mathematics, and he was a master magician. As the dispenser of the highest Wisdom, or the Logo s, Thoth is corresponded on the Tree of Life with Chok mah. But as scientist and keeper of records, he is attributed to Hod. Hermes-Thoth is accredited with categorizing the \"s ecrets of nature,\" and is the father of the system of analogies used in QBL, known as the correspondence system. These sympathetic relationship among varyin g planes of the cosmos give the magician \"control\" ov er his environment. Because Hermes revealed this \"secret\" network, Hermetic science is initiatory in nature, as is the revelation of any God. It is a M ystery which one must enter in order to attain its specifi c experience. The value of Hermes-Thoth's revelation extended pas t the Hellenistic period, and was highly succesful hrough the Middle Ages and up to the time of Sir Is aac Newton, and his scientific revolution. The valu e of the Hermetic viewpoint, with its correspondences betwee n Macrocosm and Microcosm, was rediscovered in the 19th Century \"magical revival.\" Hermes-Trismegistus, or Thrice-Great Hermes, is sai d to be the author of the bulk of Hermetic literatu re, including the famous Emerald Tablet containing the basic Hermetic Axioms, (such as \"That which is abov e, is like that which is below.\"). Hermes Trimegistus may actually be a composite character, synthesized from the personalities of several magicians. It may repr esent a lineage, rather than a single individual. Hermetic Philosophy is dualistic, devaluing the wor ld and the body. Its chief aim is for man to \"becom e god\" through the aid of divine knowledge. The aspirant d etaches himself from the world and is regenerated i n an"},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"immortal body. The theology underlying this view is Gnostic in character, but it is not equivalent in all respects with Gnosticism. The gnostic worldview is characteristic of the hist orical period, during which Hermetic Philosophy flourished. The \"saving value\" of Hermetic science through the development of an immortal body is simi lar to Asian and Persian traditions, and later developm ents in Christiantiy. Hermetic initiatory practice was not hierarchical i n nature. There is only one degree of intitiation: either you heard the Word, or not. Its major injunction was the rule of silence, keeping the revelations secret fr om outsiders. It also incorporated certain ecstasy-ind ucing practices. However, the main basis of the initiation was the r evelation of the Gnosis through a certain number of revealed texts. If you read, understood, assimilate d, and applied this esoteric knowledge, you were \"initiated.\" Initiation did not specifically requir e lineage, or the tutelage of a master in the art. Consider a modern example in the sciences. Say for some reason, all houses of higher learning suddenly vanished, and the compiled wisdom of science was lo st to the world, temporarily. An intelligent person finding a compendium of information on a given scie nce might become proficient in its application, eve n without a Professor to show the way. This autotelechy or self-teaching is part of the He rmetic path. In this sense, the writings of Hermeti cism and alchemy are similar. If it is rediscovered by a com petant aspirant, the directions may be applied in a contemporary manner, so its message is highly relev ant. Hermes is the embodiment of universal wisdom a nd intelligence. He is the epitome of analytical thoug ht and reasoning logic. His cult-forms survive in t he Masonic and Rosicrucian traditions. Hermetic arts include astrology, alchemy, writing, mathematics, architecture, invocations, and other p riestly arts. The \"W ay\" to salvation through Hermetic Arts is synthesiz ed in the pictorial Book of Thoth. It is the revelation of the archetypal symbolism contained in our modern Tarot cards. The origins of these cards is lost in antiquity. But one thing is certain, in symboliz ing the Path of Return, they embody a series of tra nsitions which is defintely Hermetic in quality and characte r. Hermes, himself is depicted in the Trump entitle d The Magus. The Inner Companion or Soul-Guide Both Hermetic Philosophy and alchemy sought the inn er experience of the daimon or \"companion\" who shows the way. This inner figure was held in religi ous esteem comparable to that of the inner guru or higher Self. Hermes, as soul-guide imparts his secret wisd om in a state of ecstasy. He lifts one into the spe cial world of the spirit where one is bathed in Nous and becom es divine. Hermes in this sense is both a cosmic an d personal guardian spirit. He embodies a paradox whi ch means he is a symbol of the Self. The equivalent soul-guide for a woman frequently ap pears as the earth-mother goddess, or mother-virgin paradox. This mystery of the goddess of Nature is a ssociated with Hermes. Like Hermes the all-mother possesses dark characteristics including cleverness , cunning, cruelty and unfathomable passion. As the aspirant contemplates Hermes as soul guide, he is transformed into the inner teacher, who embod ies the whole cosmos. This is a process of progressive internalization of those qualities. The personality is confronted with the necessity for transformation. T here is a deep and far-reaching change in the consc ious attitude. This is a long and painful process for th e ego, but ultimately produces detachment from the world's illusions. Hermes functioned in Hermetic Philosophy much as th e modern yogi. He was a way shower who pointed out that the world consists of our projections, and is only one reality among many. Hermes is not only a m agician, but corresponds with the archetypal Trickster figur e who spins illusions. Hod represents the mental body, seat of the self-co nscious objective mind. In moderns terms, it is Lef t Hemisphere functioning--logical, analytical and abo ve all interpretive. The object of mental practice here is to exercise healthy scepticism. Here you examine to confirm or verify knowledge gai ned in Malkuth and Yesod by direct experience. We learn to perceive unity through diversity. For exam ple, the synergetic meaning of seemingly unrelated symbols begins to become ingrained in us at the vis ceral level. When we perceive the essential nature o f anything, we also perceive how it fits into the Whol e. Science has shown that the essence of the universe is the One Force, Light. It has shown that all natu ral forms reveal orderly, harmonious, geometrically indentifi able construction patterns. Certain simple forms ar e perceptible throughout all the kingdoms of nature."},{"pageNumber":1060,"pageContent":"In Hod we learn to recognize patterns that occur an d recur and correlate these patterns with the unive rsal principles of which they are representations. This ability to recognize basic patterns, symbols in ima ges and life is the key to real discrimination, the ability to separate the subtle from the gross. To become identified with the Light of the Self, we must learn to focus the attention of our conscious mind. Imagery is the virtual matrix of form. This imagery must be controlled and directed to be valuable in our work. We can use our self-conscious ability to focus attention to intiate imagery which will link to wi th the higher self. One of these is simply to act as if yo u are that Self of Tiphareth. Consistent practice m akes this easier as time goes on and builds an identification without inflation, because the personality learns the differences between itself and That. Practicing identification and disidentification wit h the Self is a potent transformational exercise. I t is a process morph that is part of pathworking which wil l allow moving from the Astral to Causal once the b ody of light is congealed. First become aware of this superpersonal level by r ecognizing it. Don't just mentally affirm that it i s there-- practice it. Mentally reach upward toward it. Visua lize the light and concentrate to make it even brighter...limitless. Make yourself constantly awar e of it in every detail of your personal life, lead ing the way, functioning much like an inner guide or guru. It is an influx of tremendous power when you focus on it. This subtle awareness doesn't come all at on ce. So the exercise must be repeated until it is habit to recall your True Self. Remind yourself that you eve ry mental state, act, thought, emotion is a transformation of superpersonal, superconscious energy. In Hod we le arn to begin identifying with the Self, rather than the li mited personality. Personality becomes the instrume nt for the Higher Self. It isn't perfect, but is becoming. HERMETICISM Hermetic philosophy was concerned with in-depth que stions about the nature of life and the universe, a n intimate personal relationship with God, and reviva l of the ancient wisdom of Egypt and Mesopotamia. M ost of the texts are in the form of dialogues allegedly with such figures as Hermes Trismegistus, Asclepiu s, Isis and Horus. The dialogue format is easily accounted for since the core of these teachings come from Gre ek philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle. The main texts include the Corpus Hermeticum, Poimandres , and the Asclepius. The teachings are definitly mystical, in that man i s said to combine a mortal and godlike nature. The Hermetic creation myth begins with Darkness and Lig ht, which produce moisture and the other elements. Light is a Spirit ( Nous or Mind) and gives birth to reason ( Logos ). The original spirit creates a demiurge, creator of the worlds of heaven and earth. The Hermetics practiced a vegetarian lifestyle, as did the Orphics. They believed that at death (and i n meditation) the soul abandons the body and senses a nd ascends to the spheres of the seven planets. Fin ally one enters the eighth sphere and comes before the F ather and enters God, where all is one and the hier archy is transcended. \" Whoever co-operates with God merits release from hi s mission in the world and a return to the godlike life of the pure spirit. Those who fail to do this are reborn after death in other forms .\" This echoes notions of redemption and transmigration. These mys tics sought to become God by aspiring with will and skill to the stage of absorption: \"For the Hermetists...it is through mystical experience that main att ains liberation. In that experience, at its greatest intensity, the soul is wholly absorbed in t he vision of God...He forgets all bodily sensations and all bodily movements, and is still. But th e beauty of the Good bathes his mind in light, and takes all his soul up to itself, and draws it forth from the body, and transforms it wholly into the essence of God. I n the ecstatic vision of the divine, man's being is deified; he passes into the div ine Light...it is possible to rise to the knowledge of God, which implies identification with Him , by the application of the principle that 'like is apprehended by like'...Such equalization to G od can be attained by the illimitable extension of our being...By such an expansion of the range of his consciousness man may rise into oneness with God, who is Hims elf the Whole. \" (Sidney Spencer, Mysticism in World Religion)."},{"pageNumber":1061,"pageContent":"Hod also represents the concept that basic geometri es underlie the proportions and relationships of ph ysical manifestation. One changeless law of scale and prop ortion pervades the universe. In Hod we learn to recognize them even through complexities of outward form. Because we can observe, analyze, order, arrange, an d visualize, we can extend the possibilities and po tentials inherent in nature, much the way a gardener creates hybrids. The elaboration of mineral forms through metalurgy and chemistry were part of the foundation of civilization and alchemy. In general, Hod relates to the development of skill , in science or mystic ascent. This is similar to t he scientific method when working Qabala. First we carefully obse rve natural phenomena, then create a theory or principle based on observation. Now we are in the e xperimental stage that either proves the validity o f the theory or shows that it needs to be modified or dis carded. To be scientifically valid, an experiment m ust be repeatable or reproducable. Experimental work always has the purpose of bringin g something into form. It shares this telos with art. It may not be a physical form. It may be a state of co nsciousness or a conscious realization which repres ents the answer to an enigma. Or, the concrete grasp of some thing we wanted to understand more fully. This grou nds abstract ideas in experience. The choosing of a project--an act of will--sets pro cesses in motion that lead toward the concretion or completion in the phenomenal world. Therefore, we i ntitate the practice of reaching for guidance from the higher self for the purpose of making guidance more definitive in our lives. Another practice, that of formulating specific geom etrical shapes in the mind's eye, is for the purpos e of gaining skill in control of mind wandering. We can l earn to manipulate subtle formative substances and recognize proportions, measurements and relationshi ps that are basic in all form building. Discrimination is the keyword for the Astral, which (as Hod) has the sword for its symbol. By use of t he sword of discrimination, acquired through receptivi ty to the planes above, errors and distortions are dissolved; relationships, forces and energies are r earranged. What is irrelevant, useless or harmful mu st be discarded as an obstruction. This stabilizes one id eal quality after another into our personal sphere. This is another step in the process of integration and unif ication. Magic as a Hermetic Art Hod is a curious admixture of pre-scientific magic, and the technical humanistic willed approach of sc ience. Magic has existed as a sacred psychology among all peoples since ancient times. Whether it was practica l or \"impractical\" magic matters little. The distinction which concerns us here is between magic and wisdom , magician (Hod) and saint (Netzach). Magic and religion can be viewed as two different l anguages which interpret the perennial theme of our conscious evolution. Magic concerns developing powe r through will, while religion develops us through denial of egoistic willfulness. According to Needleman: The religious path says to man: \"surrender your trifling sense of ability which you magnify into something fantastic and grotesque, and allow the power of God to operate through you.\" The path of magic says: \"Create in yourself a will and an indivi duality that is an instrument of higher cosmic energies.\" Both magic and the path of religion in their authenticity, and as properly understood, deal with the transformati on of maninto a being who can consciously manifest fudamental power (or the \"Wil l of God\"). Magical power is related to the ability to create i llusions or trance states in others. People are sus ceptible to deception because of suggestibility, an intense des ire to please others, and passive or uncultivated a ttention. No amount of intellectual brilliance can compensate for passivity of attention. It controls perceptual focus and conceptual processes. It lets us deceive oursel ves and is the source of denial. Visual and mental misdirection, coupled with emotional misdirection c an lead to the feeling and perception of another wo rld or reality. Perceptions, thoughts, and emotions can conspire to construct illusory objects and events. In the ever day trance of consensus awareness our attention is almo st always passive, and we are susceptible to a vari ety of suggestions. We can train the faculty by sustained a ttention directed toward self-observation of our ow n processes (thoughts, sensations, emotions) as they occur in ordinary experience. This is called mindfu lness in Buddhism. Indian philosophy suggests cultivating attention to all aspects of our being:"},{"pageNumber":1062,"pageContent":"\"sensations (pleasant sensations, unpleasant sensations, indifferent se nsations, interested and pleasant sensations, disinterested and pleasant sensations, e tc.); emotion (a passionate mind, a mind free from passion, a mind full of hatred, a mind free from hatred, an infatuated mind, a mind free from infatuation, an intent mind, a wande ring mind, an exalted mind, an inferior mind, a concentrated mind, an unconcentrate d mind, an emancipated mind, an unemancipated mind, etc.); dispositions, thoughts, perceptions, reactions, sounds, tastes, colors, odors--in short everything th at could possibly be seen as the contents of the mind.\" (Needleman, 1975). Living in the world of real causes begins with cult ivating attention. Without active attention it is no t possible to glimpse the inner aspects of reality. Passive at tention beguiles with appearances, both in regard t o the universe and ourselves. It is because of failure of attention that desire shapes our thoughts and understanding, and actions. This leaves us without real mpower, acting in a false world, a construct o f the ordinary passive mind. Maimonides spoke of the mystical application of att ention and evocation of conscious energy: \"When we have acquired a true knowledge of God, and rejoice in that knowledge in such a manner, that whilst speaking to others, or attending to our bodily wants, our mind is all that time with God; when we are with our heart constantly near God, even whilst our body is in the society of men; when we are in that state...the n we have attained not...this degree of pefection...Their mind was so identified with the know ledge of God, that he made a lasting covenant with each of them.\" \"Those who are perfect in their perception of God, whose mind is never separat ed from Him, enjoy always the inflience of Providence. But those who, perfet in th eir knowledge of God, turn their mind sometimes away from God, enjoy the presence of Divine Providence only when they meditate on God; when their thought s are engaged in other matter, Divine Providence departs from them. ...This person is the n like a trained scribe when he is not writing. Those who have no knowledge of God are like those who are in constant darkness and have never seen the light.\" Humanism The skeptical philosophy of this sphere may not be religious. It may be existentialist or Humanistic. Like Hermeticism, humanism is a philosophy for people wh o think for themselves, as it challenges all metath eories. It is fundamentally deconstructionist. Humanism is focused on human means for comprehending reality, without access to transcendent knowledge. It is a p hilosophy of reason and science. Though rejecting arbitrary faith, authority, revelation and altered states of consciousness, it is a philosophy of imag ination. Humanists recognize that intuitive feelings, hunche s, speculation, inspiration, altered states, and re ligious experience remain useful sources of ideas that can lead us to new vistas. If they help in the here and now, they get applied. They just don't take metaphysical noti ons literally. If they relate to pie-in-the-sky aft er death payoffs, they are not embraced. Humanism is a philosophy of compassion even though there is no fear of after-death punishment by an archetypal Parent-figure. Humanists devote no energ y to satisfying desires of supernatural entities, s o they have plenty left over for social concerns. Realisti c philosophy recognizes the need for careful moral decision making. It is a philosophy for those in love with l ife, and not afraid of personal responsibility. With no prefabricated answers to the great questions of lif e, Humanists enjoy the open-endedness of a quest an d the freedom of discovery.

All these can be characterist ic of our desire nature. Whatever we strongly and consistently desire is always victorious--it domina tes our attention. The outcome of desire is karmic experience, since k arma is simply the result of our actions, and activ e desire and yearning lead to action. If the desire is selfi sh, we may turn away from the results in disappoint ment and disgust. Therefore, it is wise to be careful what y ou allow yourself to desire and the intensity with which you pursue it. Clarity, in regard to Netzach means that we learn t o become more effective at thinking things clear th rough. Of course, we can't foresee all contingencies, but we can develop a more circumspect attitude. Satiety with material desires makes them no longer attractive to us. Detachment goads us into a search for somethin g more meaningful--for something less transitory. Reaching upward, we find relief from dissatisfactio n and boredom, as the light of truth pours in with increasing intensity. Finally the brightness of Inn er Light saturates us with its truth. The Higher Se lf is able to gain a lasting victory over the delusions of the lower nature, and our perspective is changed forev er. This is the sphere of sincerity and truth, for we c annot pretend when it comes to desire or devotion. It cannot be faked. Our attention wanders off weak desires, b ut when the focus of desire is the search for the B eloved, sincerity is the only way to become a conscious and effective instrument. A degree of perfection is the spiritual experience of Netzach, for it is where the final work of perso nality transmutation takes place. When you are no longer at tached to earthly desires, and yearn for the harmon y of the Truth of Unity, desire becomes the key to perfe ction or individuation. But sincere desire must be accompanied by the desire to act as an instrument f or the outflow of Higher Wisdom. This requires some maturity and life experience. In Netzach our love grows and prepares us to embrac e fully a philosophy of life based on the truth of Unity and the power of Love. In Malkuth, we sought proces ses hidden below the surface of observable reality. This realization led to the desire to find out more abou t unseen realities. We learned the importance of ded icating ourselves to work for realizing our human potential (Hod) and the evolutionary force. On Path 25, we b ecome artists of the evolutionary process. In Yesod, we built a firm foundation for the transm utational work. Directed by the Self, tapping the p ower of Yesod accelerates the transmutation process by buil ding in new structures that lead to spiritual rebir th in Tiphareth. Hod helps us develop faith through satis fying the intellect with objective validation of ou r experiments. Form comes to be perceived as synerget ic interaction of points of conscious, living light . These relationships can be represented by certain geometr ical figures. Human consciousness is a formative power which grow s stronger when we aspire with increasing devotion and intensity. When we keep knocking at that door, w e realize an influence descending from above. There is a feedback loop that keeps the process intensifying e nough to keep desire alive through inevitable dry p eriods of practice. We see our experiences and the purpose of life the w ay we want it to be. When we synthesize our learning and experience into a philosophy, desire is very much a part of it. We can pursue it sceptically or idealis tically, but both can be zealously pursued. We philosophize f rom our emotional biases. The difference is that th e Qabalist's desire is a refined, unattached, and dir ected desire. It is based on practice and direct ex perience of higher states of consciousness. Desire (or bhakti ) can be cultivated and focused into full creativit y (Tiphareth). This yoga of devotion links us back to the source. Netzach is the sphere of fire on the mental plane. It means \"remembrance\" but with more acute realizat ion than ever before. The goal is kept before the mind' s eye with imagery and exercising creative imaginat ion ( dhyan ) as the force which transforms spiritual energies into manifestation. This brings an increase in devotion and aspiration, and an acceleration in the cycle of development. The seeker is ready when he can exert consistent personal effort to gain more under standing of life. Netzach brings stabilization and experiential reali zation to the mental knowledge that personality is a vehicle for the radiant form of the divine Self. First it c omes only in fleeting moments. But receptivity grou nds it in the ego, feelings, and behavior. This series of rea lizations accelerates development. Deeply knowing t hat the Self of every human personality is One, is the high est expression of the power of Venus, her truest be auty, nobility and grandeur. By demonstrating Love, we enter more fully into the stream of higher consciousness which pulls us alon g in its current. It draws the soul upward. Our compassi on and sympathetic nature is refined. We become more creative and appreciative of beauty."},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"Artistry is the result of a renewed ability to perc eive and express harmony, proportion, and balance. This blends the discerning qualities of Hod with the uni fying nature of Netzach. This results in the refine ment in the astral light of both our mental and emotional e xpressions. In Netzach, we also learn to refine our mental imag es and remain focused on our growth. Our personalit ies blossom when we receive the healing influence of th e Self. The image-making faculty in Tiphareth is fr eed of lower distorting influences. Emotional and mental p rocesses are brought into harmony. This process stabilizes over time. Netzach is called Victory, for human desire becomes aligned with universal desire--the cosmic Will. Hum an imagination is the mediating force which makes it p ossible to manifest divine will in the material wor ld. Intense desire holds the promise of fulfillment whi ch already exists on a subtle plane. All desires ultimately originate in Cosmic Desire ( i.e. karma and destiny). The highest forms of desir e are divine. God's desire results in the creation of a U niverse. Our destiny is to synchronize with that an d become its embodiment on earth. Netzach and Devotion for the Beloved Just as an emergent Hod-function indicates intellec t applied to learning spiritual wisdom, so an emerg ent Netzach function epitomizes devotion to the Great Wo rk. This refines the instinctual force, and the sou l becomes \"magnetically\" drawn toward the Self at Tip hareth. Tiphareth influences Netzach as a creative and form ative power from the Causal Plane level. Its influe nce enters the body through the limbic system in the br ain. Netzach represents the pleasure principle or p leasure centers of the brain (dopamine and serotonin cycles ). Devotion manifests for the Great Work when we are compelled to seek the Beloved or spritual guide. Th rough devotion, we adopt the principles of the guid e. Identifying with the inner teacher influences value s, choices, and feelings judgements. Spiritual mast ers teach more through love once the mind has been satisfied of the validity of the chosen path. Netzach also means devotion to the imaginative facu lty. The formation of images is the basis of art, a nd functions analogously to the development of Hod's a bstract concepts and systems. Their complementary interaction produces tangible electromagnetic field s in the body. It is through our subtle field that the creative powers of life have the ability to effect psychosomatic change, even through placebo effect. The body/mind is transformed into a kind of \"spiritual resonator.\" Subjective values have the power to exert a great c ausal influence over us. Lifestyle choices have man y repercusions which are no more than the results of our actions. Human values, ethics, and morals are v ery powerful agents in our shaping. We need inner guidan ce to choose our moral perspective most wisely. Netzach is the sphere of the humanities and imagina tion. What is required for balance is an encompassin g vision combining science and technology with ethica l or social values. It is a return to the holistic science of Pythagoras, and the ideal state of Plato, as typica l models. Psychology tells us that mental images, feelings, i deas, thoughts, and sensations create neuropeptides that influence our mood and attitudes. That chemistry in turn directs the body, but the higher levels of br ain activity control the lower. Introspection or inner experience is a potent transformative agent on all levels of consciousness, and has a generally calming effect. Emergent properties of brain function include not o nly insights, memories, ideas, reason and logic (Ho d), but also feelings, desires, needs, wishes, and values ( Netzach). These emergent, holistic properties can n ot be predicted from the physiochemical function of the b rain. Why should we aspire toward Netzach? To continue to grow, we need to raise our sights to the higher val ues exemplified by Tiphareth. We need to contemplate tha t which is beyond self-interest, economic gain, pol itics, and the requirements of sustaining life. We need com passion and sustained passion for our mystical prac tice. Long term goals require continual reinforcement. We must be involved, even if in a detached way, to h ave insights about human values. They may come as a revelation, or as internalizations from role models , mentors, or guides. Our minds can become habituat ed to more refined, compassionate responses. Thus Netzach is a compassionate way of being in the world. We reorient our value system toward universal harmony, realizing fundamentally that love is all that real ly matters."},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"THE ORPHIC MYSTERIES If Hod, with its emphasis on mind is analytical and Aristotelian, Netzach with its emphasis on soul is Platonic. Its spiritual experience is \"the vision of beauty t riumphant.\" For this reason, it is linked with the humanities and the artistic, musical path of the Orphic Myster ies. No prophet or sect had a monopoly on Orpheus' name, and many writings were spuriously attributed to hi m. Whether it was a mystery religion or not, this philo sophy predates the time of Homer. Orpheus, the fabl ed cult leader was known as the \"founder of intitation s.\" It is unknown where Orphism originated, but it is n ot a Mediterranean nor Hellenic cult. It shares man y characteristics with shamanic practices, such as ec stasies, visions, raptures, and imaginary journeys, in particular the descent to hell to recover the belov ed. Orpheus is also credited with being a healer an d musician who could charm wild animals. The doctrine of an immortal soul is central to Orph ism. Orpheus was said to worship the Sun or Apollo. This means he aspired for Tiphareth, the sphere of the S un. One legend even considered him the son of the g od, much like Netzach emanates from Tiphareth. The Pythagoreans wrote poetry they attributed to Or pheus, and the two cults share many similarities. Pythagoras claimed to be an incarnation of Apollo. Pythagorean doctrine included the transmigration of souls through different animal bodies and different regions of the universe, as well as a reverence fo r natural numbers. Many so-called Orphic rites were Egyptian and Pythaorean in origin, such as religious vegetarianism. They also attended to the music of t he spheres, the inner music of the audible life str eam. Orpheus' descent to Hades links him to the Eluesini an mysteries, and he is alleged to be their founder . Orpheus offered a religious method radically differ ent from the prevailing Olympian religion of Greece . Transmigration meant the adoption of the vegetarian imperative. Also required were asceticism or detachment, purification, and religious instruction concerning the immortality of the soul. Orpheus founded a mystery school which explained th e destiny of the soul. It explained the relation of each individual to the divine through the divinity of th e soul which could return to its source. In this Or phic concept of immortality, the soul is considered to b e entombed in the prison of the body. Its incarnati on is a death-like state, (Trump XIII). Orphics believed in the theory of metempsychosis, w hich means the passing of the soul at death into an other body. The soul is judged on the basis of its good a nd bad points and is incarnated after a time in an appropriate body. The soul is condemned to transmig rate until it earns its final deliverance. Orphic life included certain rules and purification s, but claimed salvation of the soul was the result of an \"initiation\" with cosmic and religious revelations. Orphic doctrine speaks of rhapsodies (inspired poe try) which concern the production of a multiform univers e from a primordial unity. It offers hope that our own instinctual origin can be transcended by embodying divinity. However, according to Plato, the road \" is neither straightforward nor single...there are m any forkings and crossroads .\" This sounds like an allegorical description of t he Tree of Life, with its right, left and middle paths with crosspaths. Plato adds that the just are allowed to take the right hand road. On the Tree of Life, the left-handed path is the wa y of magicians who gravitate to Hod and the right-h anded path is the bhakti path of mystics and saints and proceeds through Ne tzach. Orphic philosophy was preparation for death. They contended the soul was judged for punishment or bliss; they aimed at maintaining memory of past lives. Pythagoras was sa id to possess this ability. The legend of the descent of Orpheus to hell in sea rch of his lost beloved was one of the most popular . A variation on this theme is Dante's Divine Comedy . Ecstatic journeys to infernal regions are a commo n theme in shamanism. There are extant Orphic texts which a re similar to the Egyptian and Tibetan \"books of th e dead.\" Orpheus and Pythagoras both exemplified the \"divine man.\" They taught in the manner of spiritual philosophy and holistic education rather than formi ng religious bodies. Their orientation was transmit ted from Plato to the humanists of the Italian Renaissa nce and on to Paracelsus in the 16th century. The O rphics held the trade secrets for a science of the soul, a nd were immensely popular with the public since the y were based in ecstatic devotion. It is Right Hemisphere religion. The Pythagorean-Platonic theory of Ideas has led to the concept of archetypes as models or paradigms o f the phenomenal world. We comprehend and understand these Ideas, symbolized by the Platonic solids, through the faculty of the soul. For Plato, the soul was th e source of knowledge. The doctrine of transmigration implies that the sou l can remember the archetypal world of Ideas and en joy perfect knowledge and bliss communing with the orig inal source. Death for the initiated soul is a retu rn to"},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"this condition. Orphic philosophy taught the soul h ow to remain in the archetypal realm continually, becoming liberated from constant reincarnation. This knowledge is latent in incarnate man, and requ ires applied philosophy to make it conscious. This Orphic mythology of the soul seems to have Oriental source s, which Plato welded into a personal version. It d oes not come from the traditional religion of Homer nor oth er Mediterranean cults. Plato considers man as a microcosm in a macrocosm, and speaks of the soul as a charioteer driving his chariot--an allusion to s oul travel in a spiritual vehicle. According to Mircea Eliade (1975), \" Plato 'rediscovers' and develops what may be called the archaic ontology: the theory of Ideas carries on the doctrine of exem plary models that is characteristic of traditional spirituality .\" This newer formulation by Plato spread Orphic and P ythagorean doctrine far and wide. It even became a source of inspiration in the Empire of Alexander an d the Hellenistic culture. It has grown into the gr eat academic tradition of philosophy and the humanities .

All art is process. All proc ess is about morphology or process magic, translation from one state or another with or without some specific goal. Process morphs are metaphors. Art describes without explaining. Art imitates life. In pathworking life imitates Art. Processes connect disconnected forms. What is lost in form (crystalized) can be found in process. Metaphor is about experience, how we know what we k now. We experience the environment through flowing exchanges of information, matter, and energy. Throu gh metaphor we can relate what we know to what we don't know. Metaphor links us with an ocean of inte rrelated ideas about body-mind-self-universe. All epistomological metaphors are couched in the la nguage of the senses. They are drawn from the botto mless reservoir of the sensorium. On the Path of Return, the path \"Art\" superseeds \"The Universe.\" Pathworki ng is process magic. Each successive path doesn't tran scend the prior path; it enfolds or includes it. In the same way, the universe imparts its creative process to u s. We, in turn, impart our creative process to the thin gs we create. Thus, we engage in an internal dialog ue with persons, places, and things through our intuitive c onstructions. Our creations reveal the nature of ou r minds directly and so the universe indirectly. This is th e great current of influences (Middle Pillar) that changes our lives in accord with the holistic changes of the un iverse. It relates with us symbolically, metaphoric ally through what we might call reflectaphors or metapho rms, universally recurrent dynamic images. Our idiosyncratic expression of these universal forms i s art--a means of communicating thoughts and experi ences in a mostly personal way. A metaphorm is an object, image, concept, or proces s that we compare to something else. Metaphorms imp ly relationships between things that we cannnot explic itly compare nor literally equate. Every object, im age, concept or process is a metaphorm. It matters littl e whether a metaphorm is literally true or not. What is important is that it binds our lives to the vast un consumable life of the universe, giving us a taste of immortality. All things are intrinsically metaphorms, whether we use them metaphorically or not. Likeness of form i s only one of the likenesses between different forms of ma tter, energy, or information. What is lost in form c an be found in process. Regardless of the context in whic h a thing or process exists, our minds can connect it to something else. Intuition involves both discovering new connections and innovating new solutions. This is a synergetic process. In imagery, figure and ground a re given together and complement and sustain one another. Metaphorming encompasses all forms of metaphor incl uding analogy, allegory, allusion, symbolism, and figures of speech. Moreover, it can involve all of our physical senses in a synesthesia, implicating e very mode of thinking, feeling, creating an identification. E ven visual images can be derived from non-visual so urces. Metaphorms are ways of implying likeness between th ings, such as the macrocosm and microcosm. In metaphorming, we transcend the constraints of lo gic relating from one object to another a new meani ng, pattern, or set of associations. The symbolic langu age of metaphorms is multidimensional, operating simultaneously on many planes of associations, nuan ces, and meanings. Metaphorms invoke the idea of forming, connecting, shaping some thing (or informa tion) in our mind's eyes and hands. Our brain imposes its dynamics on everything we mak e--from concepts about the universe to techniques u sed to test or represent these concepts, from chaos to order. Process morphs connect us with everything we create and are influenced by. Metaphorming is a principal means of exploring the world, relating information from one discipline to another, connecting potentially a ll sources and forms of information. Metaphorms are expressions of nature's unity. Science also uses metaphorms. Physicists are metaph orming when tthey create words or images for describing novel relationships. If there is no exis ting word or expression to convey a concept or hypo thesis, they simply invent one. They also use creative visu alization. Visual metaphorms, in particular, inspir e hypotheses, and vice versa. Visual thinking is essential to communicate scienti fic theory. Visual models are great aids. There is a domain of thinking where distinctions between conceptions in art or science become meaningless. Visual thinki ng is a criterion for selection between alternatives that r esist reduction to logic and are best referred to a s aesthetics. We pursue this path to various degrees of enlightenm ent. Thus, art can be considered a state of mindful luminosity. This luminosity is like the soft, refle ctive light of the Moon, to which this path corresp onds."},{"pageNumber":1069,"pageContent":"Metaphors flow between the complementary worlds in which material substance intermingles in the transmutable mind where everything imaginable seems possible. Both scientists and artists take two facts or exper iences that seem separated, and find a likeness in them, and create a unity by showing the likeness. All science is the search for unity in hidden likenesses. Thus , it ventures beyond logic, in flights of fancy. These d ays, physics, once the bastion of rationality, has become very metaphysical. All the various theories and models are actually an ever-changing whole. It hardly matters if a hypoth esis or theory proves valid. What matters is that it directs us, constructively challenging our previous notion s, approaches, or canons. This alone makes it producti ve. But it must be aesthetic, as all great theories are. The brain loves to make theories about itself and i ts processes. This is echoed in the models we form for the physical universe. There are no definitive models f or nature is in constant flux as is the depth of ou r penetration of the secrets of the universe. The bod y of scientific knowledge is transient. Each theory evolves from an angle of analysis, a way of perceiving what it is \"like.\" The best are able to model many aspe cts of the world, and predict or explain the behavior of p henomenoa, providing symbolic models that lead to insight. Metaphorms (Path 25) mediate between the b rain (Malkuth) and the universe (Kether), between t he somatic and the cosmic. We can produce an infinite number of virtual structu res. Imaginary structures are called \"mental architecture\" by cognitive scientists and \"thought forms\" by philosophers and poets. Virtual (nonphysi cal and symbolic) processes are not affected by time-sp ace-form contraints. The virtual world is one of reflectionism, and this sounds very close to the ch aracteristic descriptors of the Astral Plane. This art is the way matter becomes mind. Our worldview seems to nee d a mirror, if only to serve as a reminder, or metaphorm. Reflectionism helps us conceptualize how one world may also consist of many worlds. As real ity is both and more. \"Reaching for the Light,\" c1976"},{"pageNumber":1070,"pageContent":"Art and the Artist Art embodies the rhythmic flux of the psyche either through a performance or a \"product.\" The artist combines technical craftsmanship with the constrain ts of the artform. Thus, the creation is not merely the production of free will, but also reflects the disc ipline imposed by training and materials. As such, art is the result of a unique combination of consciousness, or cognitive abilities, and subconscious drives or in spiration. The motivating force behind the process of art is t he unconscious animation of an archetype. The arche type (or metaphorm) seeks manifestation in some \"form,\" and manipulates the artist into producing this form . According to Jung, \"Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and makes him its instrument. The artist is not a person endowed with free will who s eeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realiz e its purposes through him. As a human being he may have moods and a will and personal aims, but as an artis t he is 'man' in a higher sense--he is 'collective man'--on e who carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic l ife of mankind.\" This is the sentiment that makes all process work a rt--whether it is process therapy, process magic, o r the classic modes of expression. Aleister Crowley made an appropriate choice changin g the name of Tarot Trump XIV from \"Temperance\" to \"Art.\" While both titles may be considered as acc urate, Temperance indicates a condition of moderati on, or blending of opposites; this is one aspect of \"Ar t.\" The artistic process combines inner and outer l ife. It makes what is inside, outside; we turn ourselves in side out. It is Self-recursive. It is a reconciliat ion of opposites in a transcendental, paradoxical symbol w hose purpose is unficiation. The content expressed by the symbol is as-yet-unkno wn, or pre-cogntive. Otherwise, it would be a cogni tive realization, rather than symbolic. The artist recei ves the inspiration through intuition and feeling, is motivated by the drive of the archetype, (metaphorm , or reflectaphor), and executes the process throug h sensory and motor functions. As the contents of the unconscious become more clea rly defined, there is a transitional phase from the awe and dread of the Prototaxic Mode, to the relatively benign nature of Syntaxic experience. Art is an ex pression of the parataxic mode, which mediates between these extremes. In a cursory examination of the history of art (fro m a metaphysical viewpoint), we might associate pri mitive art with the Prototaxic Mode; Imressionism (from Ch agall onwards) with the Parataxic Mode; abstract an d geometrical art with the Syntaxic Mode. These class ifications aren't literal or absolute, obviously, b ut suggestive. In the parataxic mode, there is a progressive repla cement of dread with creativity in the service of a rchetypal patterns. If the artist has talent, his works also take on collective, as well as personal value, and reflect the transformative process in society. It frequently ha ppens that artists are \"ahead of their time,\" in th at their work receives no wide recognition in their own life times. Great art has an ageless quality. Images, symbols, and ritual enactment (\"mythodologi es\") provide a means of crystallizing ideas which s till remain below the threshold of consciousness. Ideall y, they fulfill their function when either the arti st or observer is later able to consciously integrate the \"meaning\" which they embody, at least to some exte nt. This is precisely the function of the pictorial Tarot Ke ys. We gain a greater cognitive awareness of the arc hetypal processes they encode, as time goes on. The distinction between decorative and symbolic art lies in the fact that symbols portray a higher lev el of abstraction, whereas decorative art is a \"just-so\" story. It has no inherent meaning, and is merely ornamental. Visionary art gives man the ability to create his own reality, even if it is only in image s, and this has great transforming power on the psyche. We can o nly imagine the virtual habitats that will be creat ed by cyber-artists in the near future. Jung distinguished between two types of artistic cr eation. He termed one of these psychological and th e other visionary. The psychological mode draws its inspira tion from the lessons of life, or human experience (life drawing). The visionary mode, on the other hand, co ntains something of the Divine, and its subject mat ter is definitely out-of-the-ordinary. One distinction between the two lies in the degree of psychological activity or passivity of the parti cipant. In the first mode, the artist \"thinks up\" and develops the form pretty much on his own; but in the visona ry mode his own will defers to an apparently foreign i nspiration. There may be an element of passivity in both modes, but in a visionary experience it is more pro nounced. Visionary art is also generally considered more profound (unless it is sentimental art). Great art is perceived by what the visionary artist Michaelangelo termed \"the eye of the soul.\" It may be considered the Parataxic counterpart of the primiti ve's trance, or the mystic's ecstasy. The evocative power of"},{"pageNumber":1071,"pageContent":"art is embodied in the rhythm which is the underlyi ng matrix of an art piece. The power of art is inti mately connected with perception. The \"symbolic value\" att ributed to any given work depends upon how we look at it. Thus, the art critic has developed tastes diffe rent from the \"common man.\" Nevertheless, the great est art stands the test of time, and has great appeal for t he masses and connoisseur alike. The pleasure of a psychological work is largely aes thetic in nature, whereas the symbolic work strikes a deeper chord. Visionary experience carries even mor e impact than human passion. Its psychic reality ma y include or unite physical and metaphysical qualitie s. It is more effective when it conveys a transpare nt variation on the archetypal theme. For example, not e the persistent revival of classical style and myt hological themes among the great masters in painting and scul pture. Art serves a therapeutic function for societ y. It may even predict the future, as when the Cubist mov ement and later abstract art preceeded a cultural fragmentation of unprecedented magnitude. \"Art\" can be considered a process, not a product (t hough it results in artifacts). Even the performing arts, which were previously exempt, may now be preserved through recordings and film. John Gowan has classified the arts in a scale of increasing order from performing arts, to visual arts, to compositio ns in mathematics and music (which are Syntaxic in nature ), and finally verbal creativity. This does not imply that one form is better or \"mor e advanced\" than another. But it is an aid in deter mining nuances of the creative process. It is difficult to maintain much objectivity about one's creative eff ort when the physical body is intimately involved, as in dan ce. Dance is closer to a trance state, where the body r esponds to training automatically, than to one of concentration. The muscle memory does the work, mak ing the dance fluid. In thje visionary mode, on the other hand, there is a temporary withdrawl from the sense organs and the constraints of the physical w orld. Beethoven said, \" music is the mediator between the spiritual and sen sual life. \" \"Art\" is the cumulation of five procedures of the P arataxic Mode which includes archetype, dream, myth , ritual, and finally art. Archetype and Dream are im pressed directions of action; Myth is neutral, but Ritual and Art are expressed. The move is from pictorial t o enactive and pictorial--i.e. interactive. The num inous aspect transmutes or morphs from worrisome, to para normal, to religious, to magical, to creative. The parataxic mode exemplifies non-verbal creativit y. It represents the development of an enhanced relationship with the subconscious. It is a transce ndence over man's animalistic, instinctual nature t o a flowering humanity with individual, unique qualitie s. It means we become artists of our own evolutiona ry process. \"Frater and Soror Mystica,\" photo by Robert Avalon, c1976"},{"pageNumber":1072,"pageContent":"CONSILIENCE: The Melding of Hod & Netzach \"The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexit y with reductionism makes science.\" (Wilson, 1998) The emergent philosophy of Consilience, put forward by proponent Edward O. Wilson, echoes Buckminster Fuller's philosophy that we become generalists rath er than increasingly rarified specialists. Consilie nce would imply the unification of knowledge, in the sense of melding the sciences (Hod) and the humanities (Net zach). Wilson opens his thesis with the premise of the Ioni an Enchantment, which means a belief in the unity o f the sciences--a conviction far deeper than a mere worki ng proposition, that the world is orderly and can b e explained by a small number of natural laws. This r oot metaphor goes back to Thales of Miletus in Ioni a in the sixth century B.C. It has been a guiding metamy th for scientific thought ever since. Consilience is more than the concept of linking the sciences and humanities. It is literally a linking across disciplines to create a common groundwork of explan ation through linkage of facts and fact-based theor ies. This sounds very much like metaphorms. Conceptual unity is the foundation of natural scien ces. Hybrid domains are making interdisciplinary re search more productive. The Philosophy of Science reveals the vital role of intellectual synthesis and shows us the continuous thread of thought that has spanned centu ries. Through philosophy we gaze into the unknown future and give it form through our visions, intuit ions and conjecture. The relationship between science and the humanities is important for a balanced perspective and human welfare. The unity of learning was an ideal handed down to us through the Renaissance and Enlightenmen t, but this ethos has been abandoned in favor of speci alization and a plethora of \"special-ists.\" Enlightenment thinks thought we could know everythi ng; now postmodern deconstructionists tell us we ca n know nothing but a construct of the mind. They have rejected objective truth for radical relativism; \" -isms\" and \"-ists\" and metatheories help us break down and analyze cultural and psychological root metaphors. These root metaphors govern thinker's minds when de signing theories and experiments. The phenomenon of experimenter bias in parapsychology, in particular, is well documented. If philosophical positions confuse us and close doo rs, they should be questioned. Our temperaments con dition whether our original thinking tries to create order from disorder, or creatively disrupt the existing order. Wilson is a staunch defender of science and defends it zealously: \"I mean no disrespect when I say that prescientific people, regardless of the ir innate genius, could never guess tha nature of physical reality beyond the tiny spher e attainable by unaided common sense. Nothing else ever worked, no exercise from myth, revelation, art, trance, or any other conceivable means; and notwithstandi ng the emotional satisfaction it gives, mysticism, the strongest prescien tific probe into the unknown, has yielded zero. No shaman's spell or fast upon a sacred mountain can summon the electromagnetic spectrum. Prophets of the great religions we re kept unaware of its existence, not because of a secretive god but because they lacked th e hard-won knowledge of physics.\" Well, Synergetic Qabala would beg to differ about vi sionary knowledge of the structure of reality. And, of course, mysticism has yielded \"zero,\" cosmic zero. The scientific method demands certain experimental protocols. Diagnostic proceedures require repeatabi lity, elegance and economy, mensuration or a means of reducing ambiguity, heuristics or theoretical inter pretations, and consilience, consistency with other findings. Qabala can qualify with its descriptors of discret states of consciousness, elegance of symbolic encod ing, spiritual science, and coherency with all tradition s. It requires not only dissection and analysis, bu t synthesis and integration, with philosophical reflection abou t significance and value. The unification of these methods is what this path Art is all about. Networks of cau se and affect across adjacent levels of organizatio n is what the Tree of Life is all about. Meditative qabala is contemplation of the hidden design and forces of t he networks of causation. \"The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexit y with reductionism makes science.\" Just because scientists have not been perceived as artists, and mystics not as scientific doesn't make it so:"},{"pageNumber":1073,"pageContent":"\"Scientific research is an art form in this sense: It does not matter how you make a discovery, only that your claim is true and convincingly validated. The ideal sci entist thinks like a poet and works like a bookkeeper, and I suppose that if gifted with a full quiver, he also writes like a journalist. As a painter stands before bare canvas or a novelist recycles past emotion with eyes closed, he searches his imaginat ion for subjects as much as for conclusions, for questions as much as answers...T his level of creativity in science, as in art, depends as much on self-image as on talent .\" (Wilson) And mysticism can be a spiritual science. Saints te ll us that the core spirituality of all religions i s the same for everyone, everywhere, in all times. Sacred literatu re attests to this in the perennial philosophy and elsewhere. Mystical ascent is possible and leads to the ground state of Unification or God-Realization (Kether) by way of Self-Realization (Tiphareth). Anyone who bothers to repeat the experiment can see the results for them selves. In science and mysticism, proofs don't just appear. They range along a spectrum of credibility from interesting, to suggestive, to persuasive, then com pelling, and finally obvious. As in mathematics, co nclusions can follow completely from any premise, which may o r may not have anything to do with the real world. Predictive synthesis is the main form of validation of theories, but is very difficult. One way is to use reductionism across all levels of organization and all domains of learning. Qabala is ideally suited t o both this sort of reductionism to manageable assimilation of data and predictive synthesis. This synthesis is wh at Art is all about, and the synergetic creativity of its foc us, Tiphareth. What is foremost is the love of compl exity. The domain of that synergetic complexity, the nexus of the Tree is Tiphareth.

The Parataxic Mode is the designation given to this form of expression by psychologists. It denotes using symbols and images in a unique context. This is precisely what occurs in \"Art.\" However, in art the symbol s and images are no longer exclusively private, but may be shared with others. Art expresses feelings and understanding. It is the fulfillment of sensation in an audible or visual form. It is an expression of an archetypal process in relations hip with life. Art is philosophy expressed in symbols and imagery. For the s ensation function, art serves the same purpose that science does for thinking. Ot her analogies for art include philosophy and psychology for the intuitive function, and the emotions of human society for feelings. The characteristic procedures of the Parataxic Mode include archetyp e, dreams, myth, ritual, and art. Art forms include dance, drama, music, painting, cerem onial magick, alchemy, perfumery, sculpture, poetics, etc. As \"Art,\" Path 25 presents us with a new quality in our vision of reality. Th is is the realm of metaphorms, where our brain images reality and the universe in its own structural terms. This surreal vision attempts to portray the working of th e subconscious mind. In QBL, it is considered the narrow way between De ath and The Devil, trial and temptation. The artiste attempts to balance his inner turmoil through a transforming \"Work\" or \"Opus.\" History is replete with examples of this often painful process. But it can be joyful also. 1. Physical Plane: Path 25 represents both a physical and psychological harmonizing or equilibrating process, in which instability is balanced through disciplined work. It is a blending of opposites, culminating in unification and transformation through will. It indicates the reversi bility or sublimation of instinctual energies. Included are the performing arts , especially ceremonial or High Magick, with its blending of the energies of Sun and Moon. This process is designed to establish contact with the Se lf. 2. Astral Plane: The image for this card represents the exchange of male an d female energies between husband and wife. Sublime, regenerate l ove creates the \"magical childe\" which comes into it's own in Tiphareth. It also expresses love for one's Angel or spiritual guide, without which no progr ess is possible. There must be a surrender to the direction of the inner Master, in order to establish a connection with the Light. Therefore, visualization practice is critical. 3. Causal Plane: The formula of this path is V.I.T.R.I.O.L., Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (\"Visit the interior parts of the earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone\"). This has"},{"pageNumber":1076,"pageContent":"nothing to do with the \"hollow earth\" theory, but means to plumb the dept hs of the subconscious by turning inward. This represents the opening of the ego-Self Axis, as termed by psychologists. It is living the high ethical standard required by the Self as preparation for receiving the Light of Tiphareth. Increase in Self-knowledge. 4. Archetypal Plane: Consecration of the personality to the Great Work or Self. A visionary mode is a grace conferred on the gifted artist. The roots of poetry and painting lie in prophecy and chanting and sympathetic magic. The Self imposes trials and tests to transform the consciousness of the aspirant. This is True Will. The transformations appear in the form of the I- it relationship, rather than the I-Thou of Syntaxic Mode (Tiphareth). CREATION Soror Meral, 1955 Analysis steals away the body of an art. My lords, I must create, and wilt thou say me nay? Those who have nor spirit nor heart, Who cold, unthinking, speakest what they say, And only heed the world and not the highest voice; Who say it of the outside and not of Inner Self. My lords, I say the artist has no choice; He must damn thee for scriveners, For men who own a lack, Mere grovelers upon the ground Who can nor will not feel of Beauty's rack; But who must instead devour her face And smother all in words that turn Against her grace. Oh, let me be an artist And turn my scorning eye Upon the dissecting words of man That disgrace the heaven high Of love's creation. Oh, let me burn my life out And turn a deafened ear To those who would speak of me, Be it harm or cheer, Of my creation.

The artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks h is own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes through him. As a human being he may have moods and a will an personal aims, but as an artist he is \"man\" in a higher sense -- he is 'collective man' -- one who carries and s hapes the unconscious, psychic life of mankind. --C. G. Jung Art embodies a rhythmic flux of the psyche through a process, performance or a \"product.\" The artist combines his technical skill or craftsmanship with the constraints of his artform. Thus, the creation is not merely the production of his free will, but also reflects the discipline imposed by training and mater ials. As such, art is the result of a unique combination of consciousness, or cognitive abil ities (Hod), and subconscious drives or inspiration (Netzach). The motivating force or dr ive behind the process of art is the unconscious animation of an archetype, see king expression. The archetype seeks manifestation in some 'form,' and seem ingly manipulates the artist into producing this form. How often are artists s urprised by their own creations, considering them a gift of God, their muse or perhaps even an angel? Aleister Crowley made a very appropriate choice in changing the name of Tarot Trump XIV from \"Temperance\" to \"Art.\" While both titles may be consid ered \"accurate,\" Temperance indicates a condition of moderation, or blending of opposites; this is one aspect of Art. The artistic process combine sin ner and outer life. It is a reconciliation of opposites in a transcendental, paradoxical symbol s whose purpose is unification. The content expressed by the symbol is as- yet- unknown, or pre-cognitive. The artist receives the inspiration through intuition and feeling, is motivated by the drive of the archetype and the will to create, and executes the process through sensory and motor functions. As the contents of the unconscious become more clearly defined, there is a transitional phase from the awe and dread of the Prototaxic Mode (see Yesod ) to the relatively benign nature of Syntaxic Experience (see Tiphareth). Art is an expression of the PARATAXIC MODE, which mediates between these extremes th rough archetypes, dreams, mythopoesis, ritual, teaching tales and all forms of ar tistic expression. In a cursory examination of the history of art (from a metaphysical viewpoint), w e might associate primitive art with the Prototaxic Mode; Impressionism (from Chagall onwards) with the Parataxic Mode; and abstract or geometrical art wi th the Syntaxic Mode. These classifications are not absolute, obviously, but offer some guidelines for your own attributions. In the Parataxic Mode, there is progressive replacement of dread with c reativity in the service of archetypal patterns.

It frequently happens that artists are \"ahead of their time\", in t hat their work receives no wide recognition in their own lifetimes. Yet, great art has an ageless quality. Images, symbols, and ritual enactment provide a means of crystallizing ideas which still remain below the threshold of conscious awareness. Ideally, they f ulfill their function when either the artist or observer is later able to conscious ly integrate the \"meaning\" which they embody, at least to some extent. This is precisely the function of the pictorial Tarot Keys: one gains a greater cognitive awareness of the archetypal processes they encode, as time goes on. The distinction between decorative and symbolic art lies in the fact that symbols portray a higher level of abstraction, whereas decorative art is a \"just-so\" st ory. It has no inherent meaning, and is merely ornamental. Visionary art gives us the ability to create our own reality, even if it is only in images, and this has a great transforming power on the psyche. Jung distinguished between two types of artistic creation. He termed one of these psychological and the other visionary. The psychological mode draws its inspirat ion from the phenomena and lessons of life, or human experience (such as lif e drawing). The visionary mode, on the other hand, contains something of the Divine, and its subject matter is definitely out-of-the-ordinary. Terrific modern examples include the work of Mati Klarwein, H. R. Giger, Alex Grey, Gilbert Williams, and Robert Venosa. One distinction between the two lies in the degree of psychological act ivity or passivity of the participant. In the first mode, the artist \"thinks up\" a nd develops the forms pretty much on his own, even it is emergent. But in the visionar y mode his own will seems to defer to an apparently foreign inspiration, and it can f eel like it simply comes through of its own will. There may be an element of passivi ty in both modes, but in a visionary experience it is more pronounced. Visionary art i s also generally considered more profound. Great art is perceived by what the visionary artist Michaelangelo termed \"t he eye of the soul.\" It may be considered the Parataxic counterpart of the primiti ve's trance, or the mystic's ecstasy. It is the pure joy of the creative flow state. Th e evocative power of art or music is embodied in the rhythm which is the underlying m atrix of an art piece. The power of art is intimately connected with perception. Som e would argue that consciousness itself is simply pure perception -- certain ly there is no consciousness without it. The symbolic value attributed to any given work, and how it moves us, depends on how we look at it. Thus, the art critic has developed tastes different fr om the \"common man.\" Nevertheless, the greatest art stands the test of time , and has great appeal for the masses and connoisseur, alike."},{"pageNumber":1080,"pageContent":"The pleasure of a psychological work is largely aesthetic in nature, whereas t he symbolic work strikes a deeper chord. Visionary experience carries even more impact than human passion. Its psychic reality may include or unite physic al and metaphysical qualities. It is more effective when it conveys a transpare nt variation on an archetypal theme. For example, note the persistence of revivals of c lassical style and mythological themes among the 'great masters\" in painting and scu lpture. Art serves a therapeutic function for society. It may even predict the future, as when the Cubist movement and later abstract art preceded a cultural fragmen tation of unprecedented magnitude. \"Art\" is most properly considered as a process, not a product, though it resu lts in artifacts often valued by society. The transformative process can be as strong d uring the creation of an unskilled or underappreciated piece as for a master-w ork. It is all relative. Even the performing arts, which were previously exempt, may now be preserved through recordings and film. John Gowan has classified the art s in a scale of increasing order from performing arts, to visual arts, to compositions in mathematics and music (which are Syntaxic in nature), and finally verb al creativity. This does not imply that one form is better or \"more advanced\" than another . But it is an aid in determining nuances of the creative process, which we deal with more fully under Tiphareth. It is difficult to maintain much objectivity abou t one's creative effort when the physical body is intimately involved, as in danc e. Dance, for instance, is closer to the automatism of the trance state, where the body is responding to training automatically, but there is still a large component of concentration. In the visionary mode, on the other hand, there is a temporary withdrawl from the sense organs and the constraints of the physical wor ld. Beethoven said, \"music is the mediator between the spiritual and sens ual life.\" \"Art\" is the culmination of five procedures of the parataxic Mode which includes archetype, dreams, myth, ritual, and finally art. The Parataxic Mode exemplif ies non-verbal creativity. It represents the development of an enhanced rel ationship with the subconscious. It is a transcendence over man's minimalistic , instinctual nature to a flowering humanity with individual, unique qualities.

PHILOSOPHY a. Transitional Phase: Psychological Faith, Free Wil l, True Will Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will. Any required change may be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper object. --Aleister Crowley/ Magick in Theory and Practice Hume's fork: Either our actions are determined, in which case we are not responsible for them, or they are the result of random events, in which c ase we are not responsible for them. -- From the \"Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy\": David Hume The will cannot transgress the bounds of the psychic sphere: it cannot coer ce the instinct, nor has it power over the spirit, in so far as we understand by t his something more than the intellect. Spirit and instinct are by nature aut onomous and both limit in equal measure the applied field of the will. --C.G. Jung/\"On the Nature of the Psyche\" Many psychologists regard the will as a basic function; in Jung's view, however, the will is a freely available psychic energy, present in each of t he four basic functions. It can be 'directed' by an intervention of consciousness. T hus the scope and intensity of the so-called willpower are closely connected wi th the breadth of the field of consciousness and its degree of development. --Jolande Jacobi/ The Psychology of C.G. Jung Spiritual masters, philosophers, psychologists and physicists alike w ill argue that humans have little or no free will and yet must behave responsibly as if the y do. Even in the Many-Worlds Interpretations of physics where every possibili ty is played out in some fungible or non-fungible universe, certain laws of natu re hold. Even if we create the fantasy of a \"Harry Potter\" universe where we creat e our own reality through magick, we cannot escape certain existential realities, an d perhaps not our fate, destiny or karma either. Since classical antiquity, philosophers have pondered the relations hip of man's soul, his will and the Will of Divinity. Crowley was the first to speak in terms of True Will, which he considered to emanate from the Holy Guardian Angel, or Ket her. Saints speak of this true will of the soul as mauj or the Lord's Will. This Will is the union of the soul with its source in God-Realization , when the soul is no longer subjected to the illusion produced by the mind. High Magick is a spiritual endeavor, culminating in submission to the Lord's Will and merging in that u nitive state represented in QBL as Kether (1)."},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"Since some of us place value and importance on this quest and some do not, where does the \"free will\" of an ego to seek conscious transmutation originate? With in what range is man's \"free will\" effective? What is the relationship betw een will and desire? What is the proper condition to encourage with the will? Using Crow ley's axiom, will is the proper kind of force, Magick is the proper manner, psyche is the proper medium, and soul is the proper object. The soul, then, can be alt ered or experience change through mystical practice, or spiritual science. A lchemy depicts this as a process of refinement. Psychosynthesis teaches not only about the stages of the will, but techniques for developing it. A brief look at the different perspectives on this question may be organi zed by looking at the meaning of will on the various planes of existence. Will implies degrees of freedom -- but is this \"freedom to\", or \"freedom from\"? \"Free will\", or indeterminacy, has different connotations on differen t planes of awareness. In humans, the will occurs between the influence upon be havior of the instincts and spirit. \"Free will\" has no power to influence eithe r of these domains; but it is effective on its proper level in changing the psyche. 1). PHYSICAL PLANE: INSTINCT \"Free will\" has become a basis for philosophical speculations concern ing the nature of light and matter in quantum physics. The new physics has deduced that reality can never be observed directly since the act of observing alters the real ity. Therefore, quantum physics is used to predict probabilities not empi rical reality. Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle states that an electron's mo mentum and position cannot be simultaneously determined, because of the influenc e and relative position of the observer. Mystics and psychologists have intuitively perceived the importance of symm etrical systems in their explorations of mandala symbolism, an expression of underlyi ng psychic unity or totality. Physicists have now discovered an important symmet rical matrix underlying manifestation, with the help of the electron micr oscope. This symmetrical matrix is the basis of atomic structure. The small, sph erical elements in an atomic nucleus bond together as closest-packed sphere s. Imagine twelve balls surrounding one ball, in the tightest conformation possible . "},{"pageNumber":1083,"pageContent":"This is a highly ordered, or idealized condition, known as a vacuum, or \"zero- order\" state. Connecting the centers of these balls produces a geometric al form of maximum symmetry, known as the Vector Equilibrium Matrix, which mirrors the qabalistic Merkabah or Throne Chariot. This physical analog has important implications for human consciousness. In quantum physics the vacuum state contains no real matte or light yet h as in it (through the uncertainty principle) ll possible matter and light in the form of so-called 'virtual particles' or 'zero-point' fluctuations. Likewise, the state of pure consciousness is said to contain all possibilities, to be a state of pure potentiality in the sense that it is empty but lively. --Gowan, Operations of Increasing Order This matrix of 12 around 1 closest-packed spheres in the atomic nucleus has the possibility of 12 degrees of freedom of information exchange. Buckminster F uller considers the philosophical implications of this in his classic wor ks on geometry, Synergetics 1 and Synergetics 2. Changes in this system occur through symmetry breaking. According to Fuller, \"It is experientially suggested that the structu ral interpatterning principles apparently governing all atomic associabilit y behaviors are characterized by triangular and tetrahedral accommodation, wherein th e tetrahedron's six positive and six negative vectorial edge forces match a total of 12 universal degrees of freedom.\" In other words, this system represents the \"free will\" of matter which \"chooses\" to assemble itself according to this pregeomet ric model. This underlying relationship is the structural basis of all atomic nuc lei, and therefore is a prime candidate for a truly \"sacred geometry\" -- nature's own preferred rules of self-assembly. It may be difficult to make the bridge from these contemplations on the n ature of light and matter to a meaningful connection with biology or human physiology. However, this point has not passed unnoticed in the field of parapsychology. Ar thur Middleton Young shared an interest in the \"meaning of geometry\" with Ful ler. His speculations on this topic began appearing in an obscure trade journal know n as Astrologia , in the 1970s. He surmised that causal indeterminacy is an inadequate notion; that, in fact uncertainty is fundamental and certainty is derived. T his scientific discovery marks an essential philosophical shift. In his book the Philosophy of Science Peter Caws has said: \"After Heisenbur g it was claimed that everybody was free; but of course it is absurd to pretend that my freedom depends on my manipulation of subatomic particles . . .These values are much too small for my conscious endeavors to make the slightest difference to them.\" But it is not so much one's conscious endeavors that make one free, it is rat her a person's capacity to make decisions, an operation of what is generally called will, rather than consciousness. This is crucial."},{"pageNumber":1084,"pageContent":"Let us now suppose a person's decision-making depends on some kind of internal switch--let us say an on-off switch, for simplicity. The ques tion is, \"How much energy does it take to operate this imagined switch?\" Now it is no trick mechanically to make a switch that calls for very slight energy. In this article on \"Free Will and the Uncertainty Principle\", Young goes son to postulate that because the human body originates from a single DNA molecu le \"that the human entity is in the final analysis a quantum of action with the pos sibility of its decisions being in theory indeterminate.\" Of course, the organism c onforms to macrocosmic boundary conditions, which are out of its control. However, he f eels the \"me\" of an individual ultimately depends on the manipulation of micr oscopic particles, otherwise we couldn't even lift a finger! He concludes: We could say: \"Granted that some faculty makes decisions, let us call it wil l, how much power or perhaps energy would we expect this will to have?\" . . .We therefore see that the essential operative and decision-making \"me\" of a per son could be as small as a sub-nuclear particle or a photon and still be quite capable of carrying on all the operations of a human body. We also should see that the uncertainty principle, considered as basic, provides evidence that th e \"me\" of a person, even if so tiny and elusive, can be completely free from any determinative bonds within its range of hierarchic control -- a free agen t possessing something mysterious called a 'will\" and exercising equally mysterious powers referred to as \"mind.\" This certainly seems to have implications in mysticism for the theor y of the subtle bodies, or body of light, as the carrier of consciousness in the higher real ms. However, returning to more practical matters, let us consider a physio logical analog for Young's internal \"on-off switch.\" Though Young did not name this \"switch,\" if we examine current res earch in brain physiology or the electrophysiology of the central nervous system, there is an interesting direction in this regard. E. Roy Johns is postulating memory as a wave function, and wave forms as knowledge. But even more pertinent is the work of W. Grey Walter on Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), and Contingent POsitive Variation (CPV). This i s known as the \"wish switch\" and has definite implications in the determin ation of behavior. Moving through the sciences from physiology to psychology, we find that will is spoken of as a dynamism. It operates along a continuum which includes impul se and compulsion. Will is subordinated to consciousness, but subject to inte rference from the complexes (which may form an altogether contrary stream of intent). Human behavior is motivated by the archetypes on an unconscious level. It then manifests through the four functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, an d intuition. Jung described the relationship between will and the functions i n his essay, \"On the Nature of the Psyche.\""},{"pageNumber":1085,"pageContent":"Within the psychic sphere the function can be deflected through the act ion of the will and modified in a great variety of ways. This is possible because the system of instincts is not truly harmonious in composition and is exposed t o numerous internal collisions. One instinct disturbs and displaces the oth er... In the psychic sphere, as we have seen, the will influences the funct ion. It does this by virtue of the fact that it is itself a form of energy and has the power to overcome another form. . .the will is in the last resort motivated by insti nct -- not, of course, absolutely, otherwise it would not be a will, which by definition must have a certain freedom of choice. . .the motivation of the will must in the first place be regarded as essentially biological. But at the . . .upper limit of the psyche, where the function breaks free from its original goal, the instinc ts lose their influence as movers of the will. Through having its form altere d, the function is pressed into the service of other determinants or motiv ations, which apparently have nothing further to do with the instincts. What I would call the psyche proper extends to all functions which can be brought under the influence of a will. . .Because of its empirical freedom of choice, the will needs a supraordinate authority, something like a consciousne ss of itself, in order to modify the function. It must \"know\" of a goal different from the goal of function. Otherwise it would coincide with the driving f orce of the function. . .psyche is essentially conflict between blind instinc t and will (freedom of choice). This will, or consciousness, is most frequently associated with the ego -complex. Understanding the parameters of its influence, and intellectually finding itself ousted from its central and dominating position by the archetypes, the ego gr adually subordinates itself to a stronger factor. This factor is the totality of the Self, which contains all images of archetypal influence. It is tempted to follow the powe r instinct and identify itself with the powers of the Self to keep up its illus ion of ego-mastery. But this attitude soon fades in favor of its alternative -- mystical acce ss to other realms of experience. Ego gives up its emphasis on action guided by conscious awareness and thinkin g. Opting for the transcendent perspective, action spontaneously arrives for ego to interpret, after the fact. Ego's viewpoint is linear. From the transc endent perspective, determinism and free will are meaningless. So is ego's control fantasy. Path 25, or ART represents a transition phase in the relationship betwee n the ego and the emergent transcendence function. Transcendence is, there fore, a transition mode. The word itself is derived from the Latin word meaning 'to climb.' Transcendence is therefore an explicit mode of ascending the Tree of L ife. Transcendence is experienced as that \"summons from Beyond.\" The que st for meaning takes man beyond his ego-centeredness to discover his authentic selfhood. Transcendence occurs in everyday life as a threshold experience. As Phi lip Wheelwright describes,"},{"pageNumber":1086,"pageContent":"Man always lives on the verge, always on the borderland of something more. he is the animal, apparently, who has built restlessness into a metaphysical principle. . .Indeed the intimation of something more, beyond the horizon, belongs to the very nature of consciousness. To be conscious is not just to be; i t is to mean, to intend, to point beyond oneself, to testify that some kind of beyond exists and to be ever on the verge of entering it. (1) The ego continually comes to the threshold. It finds transcendence wi thin not without. The emotions (#9, Yesod) are exalted through spontaneous transcen dence (Path 25). Examples would include the feeling evoked by great art and music, t rue devotion, the immensity of the heavens, the urge to create and persist, and the wonder and mystery of existence. These types of experiences naturally rel ativize the importance of the ego, and its view of itself. In Ego at the Threshold , Sampson states that Because transcendence is a process, not a state or stage, the transition between the ego's natural perspective and that of transcendence does not happen all at once. The notion of an ego forever enlightened because it is joined with the transcendent flow in a moment of insight is a faulty notion. Our ego now enlightened, is ever reaching our toward transcendence while remainin g master within its own realm, fending off forces that threaten its centrality and dominance. It is not so much a matte of our ego's coming to the threshold and passing through, going back, coming to the passing through a door as it is a matter of our ego's continually coming to the threshold and passing back and forth. . .endlessly through life. Each voyage and return changes our ego in often imperceptible ways in its natural perspective. (2) This description of ego's passing back and forth across the threshold, i s reminiscent of the writings of Aldous Huxley on The Doors of Perception. This transcen dent function or process is Spirit transmuting Psyche. It represents th e Solar and Lunar components (Apollo/Artemis), or Spirit and Soul conjoined. 1. Lynn A. DeSilva, The Problem of the Self in Budd hism and Christianity, Harper and Tow, 1975, 1979, New York, pg. 158. 2. Edward Sampson, Ego at the Threshold 2). ASTRAL PLANE: PERSONALITY In Magick, the aspirant experiences transcendence from the instin ctual realm to the astral plane through the exaltation of the senses and emotions. On the Astral Plane, Will = intention and the power to transmute. According to the mystic, St. John of the Cross, the personality includes t he qualities of Will, Intellect, and Memory. In QBL, these are represented by Netzach, H old, and Yesod. These Spheres are synthesized in the Path 25, Art. Magickal Ceremony is particularly effective on this level. W.B. Yeats, poet and member of the Golden Dawn group, called magic \"the revolt of the soul against th e"},{"pageNumber":1087,"pageContent":"intellect.\" Magick is a process philosophy which is intimately linked to 'will\" and imagination. The Magickal personality is created by the magician through ceremonial magic k as a link with his Self, or Individuality. It becomes the vehicle for the H igher Self. In the \"sacred time-warp\", the magician becomes the embodiment of his idealized wholeness. As a magical link, this Personality expresses the conscious un ity and integration between the higher Self and the ordinary personality. This Magickal personality may be employed for two forms of magic. Low magic is designed to fulfill thwarted desires. Its practice is never absolutely necessary to Universal aims. High Magick is designed to fulfill the desire for self- transformation culminating in the return to Kether. It is an alignment with the view out lined in Qabala that the soul returns to its source in the Divine. Given the proper goal, the magickal personality links the aspirant to the Sel f. With this channel open, we can observe the role of the will in making a ritual \"w ork\" on the psyche. The active dramatic element of ceremonial is intrinsic t o the Great Work. Also, one must consider magick \"real\" in order for it to work. With a willin g suspension of disbelief, the \"Work\" may have an effect on one's psyche, an d change it in some essential way. Something that is posited as merely possible will have no such transform ing effect; it will not 'work' psychologically, and hence lacks genuine psychic al reality. In Jung's view, it requires active imagination to convert the pure ly possible -- the merely fantasied, the aesthetically contemplated -- into th e psychically real; active imagining \"invests the bare fantasy with an ele ment of reality, which lends it greater weight and greater driving power\" (CW 16,106). Accordingly, the specific function of dramatization in active imagining is to give to apprehended content the effective force which it lacks as the object of voluntary or passive fantasy. As dramatized, this content comes alive and come s to influence, by a kind of counterforce, the imaginer himself: \"if this cru cial operation is not carried out, all the changes are left to the flow of images, and you yourself remain unchanged\" (CW 14, 753). (1) Thus in dramatic ceremonial, archetypes work as psychical realities by str ucturing the imagistic contents which the aspirant puts into dramatic form. Magick \"works\" since the \"free will\" has the ability to effect changes in the psyche. In Magick, imagination is reality. Ceremonial Magick is quite dramatic. We can enter the drama of the psyche itself and participate in what is psych ically real. This drama of the psyche can change us in some basic way. This self-dramatization is active in that we ourselves are participants in the psychical play which i s produced during a rite. Aleister Crowley summarized the magical theory of the universe in an i nteresting series of theorems in Magick, Theory and Practice :"},{"pageNumber":1088,"pageContent":"I. \"Every intentional act is a magickal Act.\" This implies that anything you do which has a temporal connection, such as \"I am actively going to do this, or make that event occur\", etc., is a magickal Act. By intention, active will is implied. But even unintentional acts are not t ruly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will to Live. II. \"Every successful act has conformed to the postulate.\" The postulate is stated in the opening of this essay on Will. Every successf ul act must also be absolutely necessary in the time/space frame in which it i s performed. III. \"Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have not been fulfilled.\" This theorem includes misapplied force or wrong techniques. IV. \"The first requisite for causing change is thorough qualitative and qu antitative understanding of the conditions.\" This covers the boundary conditions of the situation; or, desire vs. ability t o fulfill the desire. Important here are the concepts of function and talent. V. \"The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability to se t in right motion the necessary force.\" For example, to effect a change in the psyche with a desired outcome requ ires a mode of \"working.\" Examples would include yoga, magick, and psychotherapy. VI. \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" This implies a polytheistic attitude and reverence for the many diffe rent valid universes. Each of us is at the center of our own \"universe. VII. \"Every man and every woman has a course depending partly on the self, and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each. Anyone who i s forced from his own course, either through not understanding himself, or through external opposition come into conflict with the order of the Universe an d suffers accordingly.\" The environment is a big influential factor. For instance, a person born in the USA will naturally develop very different thought patterns than someone bor n abroad. But either can achieve a self-understanding. Gurjieff states that all personal growth occurs through conflict. Therefore, using this theorem, if you should find yourself in a conflict situation, it is a reflection of internal complexes. Being so, the re is now a place for personal growth to occur. Success consists of fulfillment of on e's goal by meeting challenging circumstances. VIII. \"A man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is w asting his strength. He cannot hope to influence his environment efficiently.\" The path of least resistance combines conscious and subconscious goals . the ego defers to psyche's as-yet-unknown goals. IX. \"A man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universe to assis t him.\" Force is a subjective way of categorizing an energy which does work. There are many kinds of forces; and many kinds of pathways or transducers, converting on e"},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"kin of energy into another type. If you are living your True Will, you are optimally adapted to the environment. X. \"Nature is a continuous phenomenon, though we do not know in all cases h ow things are connected.\" This is a holistic approach to a holographic phenomenon. In reality, things are simply connected as time/space and ego are illusions. In the magickal view, th e correspondences underlie the manifest reality of natural objects. XI. \"Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his idea o f his limitation is based on experience of the past, and every step in his progres s extends his empire. There is therefore no reason to assign theoretical limits, to what he may be or what he may do.\" Thus, magick is a process of realizing one's latent subconscious abilitie s and discovering and using hitherto unknown forces in nature. Crowley goes on to recommend further benefits of Magick and Science for t he fulfillment of the Will. he discourses on the uses of force, and the right s and responsibilities of the aspirant. For magickal development, the aspirant must live his True Will, be authen tic, and live his or her passion. This includes knowing oneself as a person with l imitations from a realistic perspective, and becoming independent of external circ umstances for fulfillment. 3). CAUSAL PLANE: MIND (SELF) On the level of Individuality, will leads the seeker to develop psychological faith in imaginal reality. The mind cooperates with the soul, when it has finally become convinced that there is something Beyond itself. In this plane will i s defined by meditation, which is the shortcut to fulfilling the goal of union. Psychological faith manifests in the love of images, a faith which confirms th e reality of the soul. Trust in the imagination makes psychological reflection possib le. The personality is re-visioned as the projection of the soul an its image making p ower. For the aspirant, the soul is the source of the Will and personality. Pers onality is transmuted to Individuality (or becomes enlightened) through the form ula Will = Meditation. Meditation is the proper force which induces change at the Causal Level. 4). SPIRITUAL PLANE: SOUL To the mystics, True Will is submission to the Lord's Will. Through med itation the mind unties the knot leaving the soul free to rise. \"Free will\" is use d most effectively in conjunction with the Law of Karma (= Path 25) to further the soul's g oal of return to Kether. Karma is a manifestation of the law of balance an equili brium. On this plane Will = Union. In his Practical Qabalah, Gareth Knight spends hi s entire chapter on Path 25 reviewing the mystical concept of the Dark Night of the Soul . path 25 represents 'the first night or sensitive purgation. . . wherein th e soul purges"},{"pageNumber":1090,"pageContent":"and strips herself naked of all things of sense.\" The second Dark Night is on path 13, High Priestess, where the soul slays the mind through devotion for the L ord. Detachment from the world, and attachment to the Lord produces \"soul consciousness.\" There is union of Light, Love, Life, Law and Liberty. It takes strong will power to overcome worldly activity. When the mind becom es weak, then the soul becomes strong. Now mind is strong and soul is being dom inated by the mind. Mind has become the master, soul has become the slave, so will power is weak. We go where the mind pulls us; soul has to go along with the mind. When soul becomes the master, the mind becomes the slave. Then yo have str ong will power, when the soul leaves the mind. Then mind become spur and soul gets relieved from the mind. The amount of will power is determined by me ditation. 1. Edward S. Casey, \"Toward an Archetypal Imaginati on\", Spring 1974 , Spring Pub., Dallas, 1974, pp.4-5. b. Ritual: The Retirement Ritual, Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel The Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel has been considered the supreme magical ritual since medieval times, if not before. It is the single mos t perfect ceremony in magick and forms the necessary basis for further work. This rit ual establishes and solidifies contact with the higher Self and provides one with an inner guide, giving direction and unification to the spiritual quest. The Angel becomes one's source of inspiration and sustains one during dry periods in the que st. The most succinct outline of the procedure has come down to us in a Fifte enth Century grimoire, called The Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage . The book is an account of a seeker, known as Abraham the Jew, who traveled extensively in the near East questing for a master magician. After many false-starts he finds Master Abra-Melin, and begins his course of instruction. His book is a legacy to his son, Lamech, which outlines the procedures for him to follow in his fathe r's footsteps. The manuscript somehow found its way to the 'Biblioteque de l'Arse nal\", a library in Paris. It remained there in comparative obscurity until its transl ation into English in 1883, by S.L. MacGregor-Mathers (founder of the Order of the Gol den Dawn). This manuscript, among others, formed a basis for the Nineteenth C entury hermetic magical revival. Notably absent in the text is any intellectual discussion of the precise nature of the \"Angel.\" It is considered neither subjective nor objective, since t here is no metaphysical basis for inquiry. It is considered sufficient that the p rocess does in fact produce the desired end of \"Knowledge and Conversation\" with t he Angel, and that this end is desirable above all others. It predates the Jungian notions of Individuation and union with Self."},{"pageNumber":1091,"pageContent":"The active aspiration toward union with one's Angel always retains the char acter of universal necessity in the magickal worldview. Thus, it is always a prope r operation which can in no manner harm the aspirant, providing he stays true to his ori ginal oath to see the process through to its conclusion. Presumably, it is NOT mot ivated by power issues. The operation itself is a six month long retirement ritual, or retreat fr om the pressing matters of ordinary life. But it is no vacation as the work is consum ing. It involves progressive purification, and increasing fervor of aspiration an devot ion. Ultimately, the seeker directs all of his or her life's activities to r ecovery of conscious contact with the inner guide. This invocation has a spiritual purpose, and necessarily precedes any other magical rite. Until the aspirant receiv es this inner guidance, he is not qualified to practice high magic. Consciousness, alone, can not define the purpose or result of any given rite. The six month retirement period is designed to foster a peaceful, conte mplative state of mind. It is a time of detachment and withdrawl from earthly pursuits . Over a period of time, one develops a burning devotion and desire for contact with thi s inner genius or Daemon. In this manner, the secret aspirations of the soul come into manifestation. In our modern world, it may not be possible for the seeker to leave employmen t and obligations for an entire six-month period. However, the operation is divide d into three two-month periods of increasing isolation. It should be possibl e for those with enough enthusiasm to design a format which meets personal needs. Rather t han physical isolation of the body deep in the woods, as recommended, the seek er can develop an introversion through and alternative lifestyle. For example, do n ot allow the distractions of city life to encroach upon the discipline: unplug yo ur phone, limit social contacts, etc. It is recommended that the operation be timed in accordance with Sola r cycles, since the goal is solar in nature. There are two schools of thought on this matter. Th e Sacred Magic of Abramelin suggests commencement in the Spring, at the V ernal Equinox. Since the invocation is essentially one of increasing Light, this c oincides with the resurrection of vegetable life and the growth cycle. In colder climates, this timing is ideal for the country-dweller wh o may easily move out into a local wooded area, and set up an encampment by building a shelter of rude branches as described in the Abramelin manuscript. The natur al warmth of the Spring and Summer months make this a rather easy proposition. However, for the city-dweller, the situation is effectively reversed. In summer, everyone pours out of their houses, increasing the noise and hustle-bustl e. In the city the natural retirement period commences at the Autumnal Equinox, w hen everyone retires to the coziness inside. PHASE 1: The beginnings of the operation are fairly simple. One's househol d affairs must be set up so as to avoid disturbances. This includes disrup tions from"},{"pageNumber":1092,"pageContent":"outside and from internal psychological turmoil. In other words, a fairly matu re, stable personality is a pre-requisite. Then a specially consecrated cham ber is prepared. It should adjoin the bedroom, if possible. It might be as simple as a specially prepared altar within a closet or cupboard. This altar is the focus of the magical Temple. The entire area becomes scrupulously clean, and funct ions as a magical circle. Once you devise your personalized form of the ritual, it must be adhered to w ith strict discipline. This implies that the body should be kept in exce llent health, so the performance of the invocation is consistent. Whatever magical appurtenances are available to the aspirant add to the aesthetic quality of the rite. These might include a special robe, and magickal weapons such as the Lamp, censer, wand, etc. Once these basics are assembled, the first major step is the formulat ion of the magickal Oath of the spirant to fulfill his appointed mission. Put it in writing! You may even want to post it in a prominent place as a reminder, to sustain you through dry periods when it is difficult to remain consistent. The basic intent of the Retirement Ritual is that you awaken and fall asleep to magick. The aspiration for the inspiration of the Angel remains in the fore front of your thoughts. The original prescriptions for the operation suggested rising 15 minutes before sunrise to wash, dress and otherwise prepare oneself for the morning in vocation. You may want to wake slightly earlier to record your dream in your magickal journal. In the first 2-month period the same invocations and prayers (best devised by each individual) are repeated twice daily. These can be correlated with sunr ise and sunset, as morning and evening adorations to the Sun. The Angel is personal representation of this Solar quality; it is the Inner Light and Life. Exe rcises at this time might include Banishings, Middle Pillar Exercise for equanimi ty, tranquility, and stability. The Invocation of the Angel may come as the climax of these worki ngs, after the mind and emotions have been calmed and focused on spiritual att itudes. Other activities to maintain an atmosphere of sanctity during the day might include meditation, readings from spiritual writings, and noting any synchronistic events in one's magickal diary. Adapt a simple meditative lifestyle with moderation in eating, drinking, and sleeping. Observe the effect of your diet on your thoughts and ab ility to remain consistent in the Work. PHASE 2: Maintain all parameters as outlined in Phase 1, but increase the nu mber of Invocations to the Angel. Visualize the form of the Angel slightly behin d you, enfolding you in its massive wings. Add a mid-day retreat period to your schedul e. This is necessary since the mind will now experience a dry period, du ring which it is the inclination to revolve against the discipline. The mind is merely be coming detached about any stimulation from the outer world. Yet, it has not yet recei ved its"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"fulfillment in attachment to the Angel. Press on! Success will su rely follow. It may be a mere glimpse, or glimmer in these two months. PHASE 3: During this period, it is best to take a leave-of-absence from all b usiness concerns. leave all household affairs to your spouse, or housemate, if possible. Invoke the Lord's grace, that you might attain to the Knowledge and Conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel. Spend most of the day invoking the Angel with increasing fervor. The visualizations should become more and more effort less, and take on the nature of a silent communion. Through meditations you may contemplate the nature of the senses, mind and soul, which comes thro ugh when the other two are stilled. CLIMAX: If you began your operation in the Spring, it will culminate in the F all, around September 21st. This is your special Day of Consecration . The sense of immanence and expectation have reached a climactic level. If your desire has been sincere, and you oath adhered to, the entire force of the Universe back the s uccess of the Operation, at this point. It cannot fail; though the results must unfold in time. Make the final, supreme offering of yourself to God, and the power of the Ange l will infuse body, mind and soul. Your genius will manifest in a form consistent with True Will. This illumination is known as Enlightenment, and is a rapture and e cstasy, of which words cannot speak. The Angel, or real Self, becomes the center of consciousness, forevermore. The Retirement Ritual: Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel Adoration be unto Thee, Lord of my life for Thou hast permitted me to enter thus far into the sanctuary of Thine ineffable Mystery; and has vouchsafed to manifest unto me some little fragment of the Glory of Thine Being. Hear me, Angel of God, the Vast One; hear me and grant my prayer! Grant that I may ever uphold the symbol of Self sacrifice; and grant unto me the comprehension of aught that may bring me nearer unto Thee! Teach me, starry Spirit, more and more of Thy Mystery and Thy Mastery; let each day and hour bring me nearer unto Thee. Let me aid Thee in Thy suffering that I may one day become partaker in Thy Glory, in that day when the Son of Man is invoked before the Lord of Spirits, and His Name in the presence of the Ancient of Days. And for this day, teach me this one thing: how I may learn from Thee the Mysteries of the Higher Magic of Light. How may I gain from the Dwellers in the bright Elements their knowledge and Power; and how best I may use that knowledge to help my fellow men."},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"And finally I pray Thee, to let there be a link of bondage between us; that I may everseek, and seeking obtain help and counsel from Thee who art my very selfhood. AND BEFORE THEE I DO PROMISE AND SWEAR; THAT BY THE AID OF HIM THAT SITTETH UPON THE HOLY THRONE, I WILL SO PURIFY MY HEART AND MIND THAT I MAY ONE DAY TRULY BECOME UNITED UNTO THEE, WHO ART IN TRUTH, MY HIGHER GENIUS, MY MASTER, AND MY GUIDE, MY LORD AND KING. c. Practical QBL: The Many Expressions of Art ...Art has two aspects, one for the artist and the other for the beholder...For the artist, the meaning of art lies in the apprehension of a perceptive context th at is clarified and fulfilled in the work, and at the base of the whole process lies the biological purpose of attaining a higher level of consciousness, thus annulling a participation mystique...the new discovery comes to the beholder by wa of the unconscious; he takes it in like the air he breathes. --M.C. Cammerloher/\"Art in the Psychology of Our Time\" According to Jung's theory of psychological types (see Book 4, Hod), man possesses four different possibilities of reacting to his environment. These ar e represented as the functions sensation, intuition, thinking and feeling. The realm of Art consists of a). the representative or imitative arts (suc h as dance, drama, and ceremonial magick), which portray or reproduce a psycho-physical relationship and convey \"meaning\"; and b). plastic arts where visual perce ption is the central experience. In the Greek language, the conjunction of concrete sensation, psychic image , and spiritual meaning is termed aisthesis. It conveys both the notion of bre athing in (or smelling) and perceiving. The imitative arts, and ceremonial magick, in par ticular, create an atmosphere which is breathed in by the participant or observer alike. The meaning is inherent in the engagement with psychic reality. Cammerloher attributes representative arts to the function intu ition; plastic arts are the product of sensation. In the past, mystical man, guided by his favorite f unction, intuition, could attain redemption or illumination. Application of the mysteries has broadened, and mankind has reached the stage where all the functions may b e developed and serve as a key to the mysteries. In a holistic viewpoint, the total person possesses balanced activation and can use a function at will. The great artist Eugene Delacroix expressed his opinion in his journal:"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"When I have painted a fine picture, I haven't expressed a thought. Or so they say. What fools they are! They deprive painting of all its advantages. The writer says nearly everything to be understood. In painting a mysterious bond is established between the souls of the sitters and those of the spectator. He s ees the faces, external nature; but he thinks inwardly the thought that is com mon to all people, in which some give body in writing, yet altering its fragile essenc e. Art embodies or lends a visible and demonstrable form to perception and i mage. As the image becomes \"fleshed out,\" there is an experience of fulfillm ent for artist or beholder alike which transcends the merely aesthetic. The art-exper ience enables man to consciously experience his particular perceptions and images by for mative effort. Thus nature becomes both subject and object. Man as nature, becomes reflective, self-aware and perceptive. The dich otomy of the subject-object, or I-It relationship is harmonized. This enables th e artist to annul his unconscious identification with the environment, which is known i n psychology as participation mystique. The Art of Painting: Everyone possesses the ability to produce some visual representation of h is perceptions, with or without formal training. Cammerloher states: \"The var ying simplicity or development of the form then provides an absolutely unmistak able picture of the level his perceptions have attained.\" The three basic stages of artistic knowledge of the world are categorized as delimitation, direction and variability of boundaries and direction. Art i s the language for the communication of perceptions. Therefore, artistic state ments are relative to the degree of knowledge attained. One who knows the language of ar t transmits more information. This does not refer to technical training, but to the ability to state perce ptions clearly and consciously, on a precise level. In this manner, the artist prod uces \"the only possible demonstration of the stage of development attained by his image s.\" In other words, he has an ability to reproduce that which he sees with his i nner eye. As a means of removing the artist from participation mystique, the artistic act is a way of illumination. Anyone is capable of this experience at any level of techn ical ability. Technical art may be corresponded to the left lobe of the brain and i s the product of logic (or thinking). An objective experience is reproduced, for example a photographic-type portrait or external landscape. Imaginal art, however, seems to emerge from the right brain, and is a grace or gi ft from the soul. We could hardly expect the artist to work without a model, and in this instance the model is internal reality. he still paints that wh ich is \"seen.\" But, the subjective experience is concretized in a communicative form, an d he is able to share the quality of his vision with others."},{"pageNumber":1096,"pageContent":"Delimitation implies a sharp boundary; there is now an inside and outsi de (the magic circle is formed). With the drawing of the boundary, the force of cre ative action is acquired. The artist uses the canvas to focus his vision, whic h is executed using the magic wand of the brush (or knife). When one becomes able to differentiate detail within the boundary, dimen sionality is established. Complex contours and their mutual relationships are est ablished with precision. The variable boundary stage may be characterized by the three-q uarter profile, and utilizes the principle known as fore-shortening. Fores hortening gives the illusion of proper relative size. At this stage of perception-knowle dge, space acquires a meaning of its own; static vision becomes dynamic; relativity becomes the prevailing view. Foreshortening, or perspective drawing, combined with the technique of mixing paints known as chiaroscuro, creates the illusion of depth in a paintin g. The great masters of the Italian Renaissance developed this treatment of light and s hade in painting, and this advance in technique made their work remarkably lif e-like. For the painter, the world is revealed by illumination. Any painting (other than simple graphic arts) either contains a light source within itself, or one is depicted as illuminating the scene from an assumed point outside the picture. It is the painter's aim to capture as accurately as possible the effects of light on visual perce ption. Light and color are intimately related. Most people realize that color variat ion is the result of absorption patterns when an object is hit by white light. The vari ations of the spectrum which aren't absorbed are reflected back to the eye. Color is not only important in paining, but in psychology. Much ado has been made in recent years of various color therapies. However, these techniques ar i nconsistent in their attributions of the various properties of color in respect to em otional response. On this point the Qabalah furnishes an extensive, cohesive the ory worthy of individual testing. Colors are defined in terms of hue, value and chroma. Hue distinguishes one c olor from another, such as red from green. Value indicates lightness or brightne ss, and is represented by ten shades of gray ranging from black to white. Chroma means intensity or saturation of color; is it relatively pure or grayish? Colors are combined in painting according to the elements of harmony. Colors emerge from a spectrum, and so they group in sequences. These sequence s may be used as a tool for determining what is attractive to the eye, to convey just the r ight signals to produce the desired effect. Contrary signals to the eye distur b the effect, whether they are noticed consciously, or not. There are different types of harmonies. Analogous harmony comes from adjacen t hues which lie next to each other in the spectrum, such as blue with it s adjacents turquoise and violet. Complementary harmonies mix colors which are inher ently opposites, like yellow and violet, or orange and turquoise, and red and green. In a balanced harmony the entire color spectrum is exploited. A primary triad includes"},{"pageNumber":1097,"pageContent":"magenta, yellow and turquoise. A four color harmony, or tetrad, could include red , yellow, blue-green and violet, for example. In a dominant harmony one color is glorified and its influence extends over the entire design. Harmony is as sured by bringing all colors into a consistent relationship. Another important aspect of painting is the law of field size, or control of the field. An expert in this is able to create unique and startling color illusions . Control of the field is achieved through producing a quality which pervades the entire canvas. It is an illumination quality -- bright, dark, grayish. The artist then adds touche s of hue to make the canvas come alive, create a world of its own. Details in the canvas may appear lustrous, iridescent, luminous. Other qualities are transparen cy, texture, and solidity. To make a lustrous effect, requires mixing the background in s hades by adding black. Then, pure intense color in small amounts appears lustrous. L uster depends upon black contrast. The iridescent effect, like opal or mother-of-pearl, requires a backgro und of a gray field. The predominance of soft gray creates an illusion of mistiness. The luminous effect is complex and subtle. Purity contrast, not value or hue, yields the desired effect. The luminous effect was brought to perfection by Rembrandt. The effect is seen in paintings where the light source is internal, such as a candle or f ire-glow. Also, light shining into the eyes blurs vision, so this diffuseness must be accounted for in the painting. Highlights and shadows add the finishing touches. A delicate transition from normal color into shadow, with a diffuse edge simulates \" reality.\" The Art of Magic There is magic in art, and art in Magick. The magic of art is its expression of symbol or prototype. Art is the symbolic forming of archetypes working in time. In th e creative process, the artist becomes seized or fascinated; the arch etype rises up in him and he creates the images in his personal form. He shapes them int o a \"work\" because he has been sufficiently aroused to call forth his creative power s. This process is analogous to that produced through ceremonial magick. At the culmination of the rite comes the assumption of the godform, where the as pirant is seized by the archetypal power he has called up. The creative power of this form subsumes him. His \"work\" is in fact the Opus of the Great Work, the process of Self-transformation. Drama and dance are closely related in origin to ceremonial magic. So is the art of perfumery, through the development of incenses and fumigations. These scents were designed as psycho-sensory evocations. They call forth certain psychological s tates. Rhythmic swaying and dancing, and circumambulations are fundamental in ri tual. Modern forms of dance have their origins in rites of the past. According to Juli an Jaynes, in The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicame ral Mind, ballet is intimately linked with the goddess Artemis, which corresp onds with path 25, ART."},{"pageNumber":1098,"pageContent":"The golden oracle at Ephesus, famous for its enormous wealth, had trained eunuchs as mouthpieces for the goddess Artemis...and the abnormal dancing on the tips of the toes of modern ballerinas is though to derive from the dances before the altar of the goddess. In Magick, the will and the senses conspire to stir the emotions. Throu gh consecrations, oaths, invocations, the aspirant changes his experience of real ity. He is transported to another world in a quantum leap of consciousness. A modern , example, which is not magick, per se, is the ability of movie makers to creat e a simulated 'astral journey.\" Caught up in identification with the movie, we are led along through another time, another place, another life, another world. Magick seeks to tap mystical experiences of this type which are internal, and s piritually meaningful. In Magickal ceremony, the aspirant knows whether the work appeals to him; he may consciously understand, or wish to understand the latent meaning of the rite. In either event he intuitively perceives and apprehends the archetype s and their meaning. They enter into him unconsciously. In a discussion of Art, it is pertinent to recall that Crowley re-name d Path 25, changing its name from Temperance to Art. We may infer from the position of this path on the Tree of Life (between Yesod and Tiphareth), that it concerns harmonization of the archetypal dynamics of \"spirit\" (Hod/Mercury) and \"n ature\" (Netzach/Venus). Art, then, forms the magickal link between the archetypal and instinctual realms. We may also refer to creative aspects of psychology, techn ology, alchemy, and magick as artistic expressions. There are also correspondence s with Tantra, sex magick, and enflamment. Entrance to the solar sphere Tiphareth via the 25th Path, Trump XIV, in Magic k implies Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. In psychology, this process is termed Individuation or coming into consciousness of the Self. This implies a breaking up of one's involvement in the collective psyc he, or participation mystique, and a transformation of personality. To enter this st ate \"balance is required--the ability to let the ego move downstream, to los e its centrality and control, to give in, submit, enjoy and pleasure itself in the fl oodtide of becoming and then return to its central point, enriched by the experie nce; strengthened by its weakness, in its recognition of the limitations imp osed by living entirely within the world of the natural standpoint.\" In his work Ego at the Threshold , Edward Sampson substitutes the word 'transcendent' for the power of archetypal spirit, and states that \"Balanc e is achieved when the natural standpoint and the transcendent meet in an at mosphere that permits the transcendent more than lip-service guidance in our everyday lives; with such balance we can extend ourselves beyond the everyday and experienc e a world always available; balance is achieved when the ego moves off to the side, enjoying living life, not merely thinking about it.\""},{"pageNumber":1099,"pageContent":"Magick, as art, carries us into the sacred realm outside of time and space, and may even predict the future. Art may be defined as recognition, selection and projection. Craft, on the other hand, (including Wicca, often termed 'the Craft\") conn otes the manual dexterity, charm or ability to create what you want. Art is a process, not a product, not the selection of a product. Art and magick build pathways in the mind for energy to flow; it develops a characteristic archetypal pattern. In the \"arte de magick,\" man gives for m to his own vision of Reality. The psychological effect of ceremony is profound and transformative; nature looses her omnipotence, and the aspirant gains independence, a sense of purpose. Magick mediates between the bizarr e inner world and ego-consciousness. The Art of Alchemy Another variation on the theme of magic is the alchemical Opus. It also invol ves an aspirant practicing the process of self-transformation. Carl Jung and his followers have detailed the correspondences between the alchemical work and mode rn psychotherapy. It seems, in fact, that alchemy is an antique form of psychotherap y, or service to the psyche, (or the gods). In projecting the contents of his unconscious onto the elements of th e work (sun = gold, moon = silver, mercury = quicksilver, etc.) the alchemist is able to uni te the opposites within himself and effect the transformation into the Phi losopher's Stone. This stone, in fact, represents the point of maximum equilibration. Al chemy is a sacred work, requiring the aspirant to be Self-oriented, rather than ego- oriented. The individual is considered a microcosm of the whole of existence: The individual psyche is and must be a whole world within itself i n order to stand over and against the outer world and fulfill its task to be a carrier of consciou sness. For the scales to be balanced, the individual must be of equal weight to t he whole world. In Psychotherapy and Alchemy, Edward Edinger lists the following among the alchemical operations: calcinatio, solutio, coagulatio, sublimatio, mortificat io, seperatio, and the final coniunctio which results in the birth of the homunculus or Philosopher's Stone. Poetic Metaphor: For the poet is a light and winged and holy Thing and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses. And the mind is no longer in him. When he has not attained this state, he is powerless and unable to utter his oracles. -- Plato/ Ion There is an ecstatic inspiration common to vision and word, song and prophec y. The origins of poetry lie deep in the history of mankind. In the remote past the subconscious spontaneously produced magical incantations and songs. This"},{"pageNumber":1100,"pageContent":"transpersonal expression was fundamental in the creation of society or cul ture. The rhythmic sensuous images of prophecy and poetry enriched the conscious ness of the individual and group, alike. In Plato's viewpoint the poet does not awaken the images; rather, the images awaken him. The gift of the poet is to capture and record the interrelati onship of an archetype with his intellectual and emotional complexes, in an instant of time. Assuming that his technique is proficient, his task is to prevent th e ego from tampering with the poem, refining or tempering the contents of the ps yche, convinced of personally writing (rather than receiving) the poem. Among the metaphors of poetic speech are perceptions made through paran ormal experiences of the senses. An example is \"seeing music\", \"hearing the s tars sing\" or experiencing \"bitter cold.\" In each descriptive phrase a quality or exper ience of one sense is combined with an object not ordinarily associated with it. Neve rtheless, an understandable meaning is conveyed intuitively. We all sense the inheren t meaning of \"warm or cool colors\" or \"bright sounds\". This perceptual phenomenon is known as synesthesia, or sensory blending. This sensory blending is common in mystical experiences of an \"extrasens ory\" nature. Actually they never are perceived through an extra sense, at all. But t hrough a re-visioned experience of the normal five senses. Poets are able to 'touc h the stars\", or see \"dawn smile\", or be \"lulled by glowing light as if it were m usic\". Pervading a high degree of poetic metaphors are images of light and sound, in whi ch brightness equates with loudness and brightness and pitch have an affi nity. However, this doesn't mean loudness and brightness are perceptually or metaphorically equivalent in all cases. There are many examples of poets who were involved in a spiritual quest. Wi lliam Blake, of course, combined both his talents in poetry and illustration. The 19t h century revival of the Western occult tradition influenced the works of W. B. Yeats and Aleister Crowley. In America, the New England contingent of Transcendentalists included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickenson and ot hers who sought reality through spiritual intuition. Some of the most soul-moving poetry comes from the writings of the Saints or Masters of the East, the mystic poets. There is a great deal of beautiful Su fi poetry. Sikh scripture is also replete with references to the Light and th e Sound of divinity. Kabir and Guru Nanak were saints who expressed their love for the Lord din poetry. Other oriental poetic forms include the Zen Koan, and Haiku. Both convey a profound spiritual message in a minimal number of words. Modern examples of the psychological quest are poetess Anne Sexton, Rainie r Maria Rilke, Walt Whitman and Robert Bly. The \"Artistic Temperament\""},{"pageNumber":1101,"pageContent":"The public has a way of creative mythologizing which makes the artist mor e than an ordinary person. The phenomena which creates movie stars and superstars occ urs in other fields and projects the \"mad scientist\", or \"eccentric arti st.\" Part of the artist's gift is his relative lack of adaptation to the values of \"average \" society. The artist is aloof from daily life, in a world of his or her own. Or, if t hey are close to the streets, they have a radically different perspective on t hings which produces his unique vision. Rodin, Picasso, and Dali are all examples of psychological \"rugged individualism.\" An artisan has a trade; an artist lives an alternative lifestyle. It is impossible to analyze why this impulse occu rs to one individual and not another. According to Jung, an artist leads a dual existence; he mediates between wor ld like a shaman: In his capacity of artist (the person)....is objective and impersonal -- even inhuman -- for as an artist he is his work, and not a human being. Jung observed that every creative person could be considered a \"duality or a synthesis of contradictory attitudes,\" a unique human with a personal lif e, but also the carrier of an impersonal creative process. The artist's creative achie vement cannot be accounted for by an examination of his personal psychology. A Masterwork stands on its own. Jung even went further by stating that: The personal life of the poet cannot be hold essential to his art -- but at most a help or a hindrance to his creative task. He may go the way of a Philistine, a good citizen, a neurotic, a fool, or a criminal. His personal career may be inevitable and interesting, but it does not explain the poet. Society frequently projects artists are folk heroes or antiheroes. In Sam Keen's Voices and Visions , Joseph Campbell states: The creative mythology of the modern artists arises when the individual has an experience of his own -- of order, or horror, or beauty -- that he tries to communicate by creating a private mythology. So it is the creative individual who must give us a totally new type of nontheological revelation, who must be the new spiritual guide. Campbell sees creative artistic work as a \"response to the need to esca pe from danger and chaos and find some new security.\" This inner quiet repeats th e main theme of the hero monomyth (see Book VII, Tiphareth for Hero archetype). Further development of consciousness leads the artist to acute percep tion. He no longer simply reflects the collective values, he is now free to critici ze them. Campbell states, \"...the world of the artist or the intellectual must be fierce, accurate in its judgment of the fault in a person or society. But along side th is judgment there must be affirmation and compassion. What is important is t o keep the dissonance between judgment and compassion.\""},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"It is curious that Campbell should employ precisely these words. This j udgment and compassion refer explicitly to the qualities know respectively (in q abalistic terms), as Geburah/Mars and Chesed/Jupiter. They are the sphere which are encou ntered immediately after Tiphareth-consciousness is achieved. They represe nt aspects of the Individuality, just as the lower spheres denoted aspects of the pe rsonality. Specifically, Geburah represents the force aspect of individuality. Ch esed represents and transmits the ideal form of the individuality from the Supernal Tri ad to consciousness. The Supernal Triad (or top three spheres) represent s existence so ideal the mind cannot conceptualize it. It is the true home of the soul . For consciousness to enter this level of mystical attainment means bal ancing the forces of Geburah and Chesed on the Middle Pillar. This harmonization corresponds with path 13, Trump II, The High Priestess . We may consider The High Priestess a higher octave of \" Art ,\" since both a lunar in nature. The Priestess knows the art of piercing the veil, or soul-making. Not all would-be artists, however, attain this integrated ideal. Like shamans , some artists have inherently imbalanced personalities. Many experience a gut- wrenching pathos, a sad yearning which may be encoded in their work. Susanne Langer describes her reaction to such art in Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling. The fact that I know as much as I do of the essence of pothos comes from meeting with great music (and art). If those passages make me sad is an extraneous and irrelevant detail. My grasp of the essence of sadness...comes not from moments when I have seen sadness, but from moments when I have seen sadness before me released from entanglements with contingency. We have seen this in great beauty, in the works of our greatest artists. In therapy, unexpressed pathos (which is an indicator of the Puer archet ype; see Chapter 7, Tiphareth), is sometimes given vent through creative activity. Th e therapeutic value of art has long been recognized. Jung encouraged his patients to give free reign to their preconscious contents by painting in a spontaneou s manner. However, Langer points out that, It may well be that an artist never creates a work of art unless he is emoti onally stirred; if so, it does not follow that this, his own emotional excitement is what he portrays. ...may portray something quite independent of his own psychic proc esses. He may go beyond the thing felt. In art therapy, the resulting paintings often lack technical precision , but show striking examples of the symbols and imagery of the individuation process. Th e most prominent motif in these artistic expressions is the mandala. I t is a variation on the magical circle, a symbol of the unfolding Self. A modern cultural example of unfolding variations on the mandala comes from a branch of technological art which corresponds with Path 25: Aerospace.

There is always the puer complex at work motivating the artist, as well as an element of Narcissism. The artist has a love relationship with the image of himself which is projected onto the canvas. Both imaginal art and archetypal thought enliven the world of fantasy and imagination, by turning vision inward. They are a release from the literalization of object-orientation. They take the p sychic energy which normally flows outward, and turn it in. Art therapy is a way of integrating the values of archetypes. But in order for th e values of, let's say the anima or animus, to be incorporated into the personality of the artist, he or she must assimilate the psychological significance of th eir own work. Otherwise, the creative urge may be just another way of projecting one's i nner reality into the outer world. This integration does not always happen spontane ously to the artist. If this were so, every great artist or poet would be a Self-Re alized or God-Realized individual. History has shown different. Discipline is not the only distinction between the true artist and t he dabbler or dilettante. To subject oneself to hard work and the evaluation of one's fe llow man is no small accomplishment. The development of artistic insight rather th an an externalization of one's specific neurosis is another. One must combi ne the innate curiosity and vitality of youth with the maturity and dedication of experie nce. In her classic on the archetype of Eternal Youth, Puer Aeternus , Marie Louise vonFranz discusses the artist and puer complex. In the really great artist there is always a puer at first, but it can go furth er. It is a question of feeling-judgment. If one ceases to be an artist when ceasing t o be puer, then one was never really an artist. Objectifying the puer, is only the first step. Puer has to learn to carry on with the work he does not like, not only with work where he is carried away by great enthusiasm, which is something everybody can do...being carried away by a festival of work. Puer has to kick himself again and again to take up the boring job through sheer will power. Puer is also the impulse to feel special, precocious, or gifted. The compl ex is a desire. What, then, are the psychological criteria for an \"artist\"? VonFranz lists som e in her work, Creation Myths. ...these four factors -- originality, consistency, intensity, and subtlety -- (show) the differences between someone who has creative fantasies and someone wh o is only spinning neurotic nonesense...the continuity of devotion an indivi dual is capable of giving his fantasy is very important and shows the difference between someone who is gifted with creative fantasy and somebody sucked into sterile unconscious material.

The great painters, instrumentalists, vocalists, dancers, sculptors, photographers, athletes, hun ters, racers, gamblers -- all need the skills which come only from excited concentration on an activity for long periods.

Variety is essential to the concept of beauty. The supreme beauty, the height of finit e art, is the drama of the unification of the vastness of the cosmic extremes of Creator and creature. Tiphareth is the Sphere of Beauty, and Perfect Equilibrium. It is th e gateway to the Causal Plane of Universal Mind, or the Self. The translation from the Astral to the Causal Plane is as dramatic as that between Physical and Astral. It require s the development of a more subtle aspect of the Body of Light, so the soul may experience that level of awareness. The Causal Body is called a Diamond Body, or the Ruach -- the moral soul. Tiphareth represents a comparatively high initiation for religious, or mys tical man. Here the entire life is dedicated to spiritual devotion, in a 24 hour-a-d ay ritual. This initiation to a Way of Life is experienced as a death for the ego. It leads to spirit ual rebirth and ascension to higher imaginal realms in mystic ecstasy. The Gr eat Work becomes the priority of one's existence. The spiritual bud formed in Yesod, flowers in Tiphareth in Enlig htenment. Many systems describe this grade through various images; Self, Holy Guardian Ange l, Philosopher's Stone, Universal Mind, Brahm. 1. Physical Plane: Tiphareth represents the Vision of the Harmony of Th ings, and is the point on the Tree of Life of maximum equilibration. This same formula is represented in mathematics as the Vector Equilibrium Mat rix. The Cube is a magickal symbol for Tiphareth. The VEM is an octahedron- within-a-cube, which is also the atomic structure of the diamond. 2. Astral Plane: A contemplative life in harmony with spiritual princip les becomes the primary ritual. The magical images for Tiphareth include a magickal or divine child; a resplendent king, and a sacrificed God. These represent stages in the Mystery of Death and Rebirth. Tiphareth also corresponds with the Egyptian god, Osiris. Initiation on the path to God- Realization turns one's attitudes upside-down. Devotion to the Great Work; Pride. 3. Causal Plane: In the Causal, the Vision of Harmony indicates that all spiritual progress comes through the principle of Love. It implies th e highest ethical standards in both behavior and thought. The Syntaxic Mode means one has a precise cognitive awareness concerning the relative value of mystical experiences, and has the verbal creativity for expression. Thus psychology can express in words what mystics experience through intuiti on."},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"Syntaxic Mode includes Tantric sex, creativity, alpha states, etc. It verges of knowledge Ecstasy, but is mainly inspirational in quality. 4. Archetypal Plane: Tiphareth is the Royal Marriage of the Soul and the Lord. The projections of anima or animus have been returned to their proper level in the unconscious. The King and Queen are united: Spiri t and Soul, distinct but conjoined. The aspirant enters a period of exploration of soul by spirit for psychic fecundation. This union with the Self, uniti ng all opposites is an illumined lunacy. Tiphareth represents the halfway point on the continuum of spiritual development. It indicates the ability to withdraw the attention from outside to insi de and hold it there. One contemplates the \"radiant form\" internally. Self-Realizati on opens the beginning of the path to God-Realization through Grace, along Path 13. Approaching Tiphareth there is a quiet period of deep reflection and as similation in which you incorporate or build in the knowledge and realization developed in the other spheres. Until this maturing of knowledge into automatic respon ses has taken place the work is not finished; there is a gestation period which pre cedes the birth of the higher consciousness upon the level of personal awareness. That birth establishes the domain of Spirit over all the activities of per sonality. There is a gradual incorporation of superconscious energies into your vehicl es of personality which prepares the way for the dominion of the Higher Self over t he lower nature. Accomplishment is brought about by conscious transparency. . .conscious mediatorship for a higher power. It is the result of willingly and deliberately acting as a quiet channel through which superconscious en ergies can be transmitted to levels below. We act as such a channel by learning how to give some form to our spiritual insights. The influence and multiplication of such forms in the colle ctive human consciousness strengthens its higher impulses an eventually will se t it free from slavery and delusion. We need to help one another. We need to use the personal level faculties -- reason, analysis and discrimination, compassion -- as far as they go. There must be a base of stabilized positive personality attributes to fu nction as a channel for the Self. One example of this is in regard to sex. A highly develop ed love nature holds it in great reverence, since the capacity for deep compassi on and selfless love has been cultivated. This purifies our responses. What we learn about on the three paths leading to Tiphareth is crucial to stab ilizing contact with the Self. The purification and transformation of personalit y must be reflected in the habitual behavior, that is, established in Yesod. Yesod i s the plane of mobile forces and changing patterns. It is here that transformations -- changes in for -- are to be effected. Tiphareth, then, is the most advanced level of pe rsonality unfoldment. The three paths challenging the aspirant for Tiphareth ar e those of ARt, the Devil and Death. The personality finds itself confronted wit h the Angel of the Self, the Devil, and the ever-looming specter of mortality, Death."},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"The Devil has to do with liberation from the delusion of outer appearances. I t connects Hod with Tiphareth. The Angel of Art is a symbol of the Self and th is path links Yesod with Tiphareth. Its tests concern destroying the false sense of personal separateness and it consequent selfishness. It means exposing the vest iges of spiritual and personal pride and prejudice that keep us from union wi th the Self. Death represents the utter destruction of the personal sense of wi ll which distorts the Divine Will -- ego death. These personality hindrances must be trans muted and equilibrated. Basically these tests are concerned with intensif ying your ability to discriminate in a higher, finer sense. By applying them to all aspects of your personality you should begin to detect where you are still acting in ignoranc e and self-delusion (psychological blind-spots). You should further be able to acknowledge any such shortcomings without re gret but with an eager willingness for change. Our eagerness enables the Higher Self to reveal those deep-rooted patterns of error that the personal level cannot d etect in itself. When the underlying cause is perceived then w must act and cont inue to act. The method is given to rid ourselves of unwanted tendencies and habits -- whether they are mental, emotional or physical -- by repeatedly thought-stopping an introducing an opposite corrective pattern until the required balanc e is achieved. This is the work of the Self when it appears as the Angel, the Devil of e nslavement and the skeleton of Death. These tests refine the personality to act as a re ceiver and transmitter of superconscious energy to the physical plane. Personal expr ession gets refined and separated from ignorance and delusion. The emotional-desire nature of Netzach is purified; the intelle ctual reason and discriminating faculties, likewise. Correct habits are established in the astral body -- such as preparedness for meditation at a regular time -- and the physical body reaps the rewards of inner harmony. Ayin , the Path of Renewal, is concerned with helping us develop a more penetr ating vision so that we see behind surface appearances. Samekh is concerned wi th liberating ourselves from the many errors that keep us acting as if we were really separate beings. Even spiritual aspiration can be trained by separation. It w ill express as a desire to be appreciated and considered highly evolved by others . Advanced aspirants are particularly susceptible to this spiritual pri de which stands as a major hindrance unless realized and cleared away. The Path of Nun is the t est applied to Netzach to help you realize that control of desire means control of imagination. In Hod, our goal was to begin using the faculties of reason, analysis and discrimination in ways that aid spiritual enlightenment instead of war ring against it. The test of Ayin tells us to look for that proof-seeking skepticism that b inds us to earth. Samekh is the higher use of discrimination that keeps intelle ct from obstructing the conscious realization of the Unity of Being (holistic per spective). The test of Nun applied to Hod should help alert you to ideas you express that betr ay a fear of death and a consequent disbelief in immortality.

Unworthy responses, such as prejudice, cri ticisms, power trips, and impatience with others are certainly divisive in natur e. In truth, the higher Self does all the work of integration, but from the le vel of personality it takes seemingly persistent and continuous effort. Entran ce to Tiphareth means, at first, sporadic contact with the Self. We become aware of the discrepancies between the Beauty we glimpse during union and the rout ine acts and attributes of our personalities. This may be painful, since we identify with those acts and our liberations is not yet complete. We have been preparing the personal ity for conscious union. Now further transmutation continues, intensified by regenerated power. You know what personal acts you need to change to reveal the influenc e of the higher Self, so personal expression shows its impress. Your capaci ty for love, service, and unselfishness will increase, even though the lower person al self would rather stay in its delusion of separateness. Once we see personal error, we can free ourselves from perpetuating the m by repeatedly refusing to respond in ways that keep them alive. These inclu de anger, greed, vanity, envy and attachment as well as criticism of others. When we deny them expression we clear the karmic obstructions that keep us from enj oying conscious linkage with the higher Self. That Self, which is One in all humanity, cannot get through until our treatm ent of others shows we understand. Our new image represents the unobstruc ted expression of the higher Self through our personalities. It is first es tablished in the emotional-desire nature of Netzach. The goal is the complete dominion of t he higher Self over the lower nature. In Netzach this goal or will-idea is formulated into our philosophy of life and becomes the main object of desire. This is the core nature of Bhakti. It appropriates the energy of the many conflicting subpersonali ties of our lower nature. It purges the meanderings and idle wishes of the undir ected imagination. We may be faced with the truth that much of what you considered loving and brotherly in ourselves was quite tainted with a desire to be admired an d looked up to by others. It is through such realizations that true humility becomes possible. When we can face the truth that some of our beneficent acts wee bound up w ith a secret satisfaction in appearing highly evolved, we realize how far we still have to go. Our ideal needs to be elaborated and given fuller shape through the practic e of meditation, plus the actual ways and means for expressing the Self in dail y life need to be stabilized, grounded.

The transformation is hinted at in the word Tiphareth. It is from a root 'par' w hich means to gleam, to explain, to make clear -- purity free of distortions. It forms a sure foundation for the reception and right interpretation of intuiti ons. Otherwise superconscious light is experienced as bliss, ecstasy or joy."},{"pageNumber":1111,"pageContent":"Once union with the Self is experienced, the orderly unfoldment of t he potentials attributed to the sphere above Tiphareth is essentially assured. A state of continuous contact and expanded awareness, of freedom and inner harmony may take a very long time to perfect, however. The ancient alchemists used to say they had to make the Philosopher's Stone, over and over. That is what daily practice is for -- to ke ep that flame alive. The higher mind which enables us to think, to will, to de cide anything at all -- is not personal. Every seemingly self-originated thought or voli tion or decision is actually derived from this higher impersonal source. So we n eed to connect with it, in constant remembrance, drawing on the nourishment of the Audible Life Stream. In the early stages the impact of this truth requires some rather diffi cult adjustments. There is a period when the enormity of the task facing yo appe ars impossible to complete -- in fact, it never is completed. To actually re verse our moment by moment thinking and feeling and stand up for the values of th e Self seems at first an impossible job. Consistency is all-important -- it c reates a new groove in the mind. It stabilizes a pattern of attention turned inward and eventually brings illumination through grace. Its radiance refers to a supernal realiz ation, experienced in the whole psychophysical system. This is why it also heali ng in nature. There is no short cut, besides meditation. It takes discipline, great en durance and daily, hourly effort to reverse the seeming reality of personal isolated wi ll. If we are lukewarm or irregular in our efforts, then the time of our higher awakening i s forestalled. Through the Saturnian influence of the Neshamah, the Divin e Soul in Binah, discipline is applied to the entire area of the mind. Concent ration and meditation gradually prepare us to receive true intuitional guidance from the Radiant Form. Actually it is this unfolding contact with Neshamah -- at fi rst, so subtle -- that is responsible for every expansion of consciousness, every il lumination on the Path of Return. Remember, it is not individual awareness that is being renounced. That is the gift of long eons of existence in the manifest worlds. It is separative goals that are being renounced. \"Not my will but Thy Will be done.\" What we want to do is dedicate individualized awareness to the purpose of the Unified Whole. Then we come to know ourselves individual cells in the body of humanity. As awakened fr agments, we turn our every effort toward bringing our whole self to the perfection of its goal.

If we therefore desire to attain human perfection, and to be truly men of God, we must awake from our sleep, and bear in mind that the great king that is over us, and is always joined to us, is greater than David and Solomon.

It is th e gateway to the Causal Plane of Universal Mind, or the Self. The translation from the Astral to the Causal Plane is as dramatic as that between Physical and Astral. It require s the development of a more subtle aspect of the Body of Light, so the soul may experience that level of awareness. The Causal Body is called a Diamond Body, or the Ruach -- the moral soul. Tiphareth represents a comparatively high initiation for religious, or mys tical man. Here the entire life is dedicated to spiritual devotion, in a 24 hour-a-d ay ritual. This initiation to a Way of Life is experienced as a death for the ego. It leads to spirit ual rebirth and ascension to higher imaginal realms in mystic ecstasy. The Gr eat Work becomes the priority of one's existence. The spiritual bud formed in Yesod, flowers in Tiphareth in Enlig htenment. Many systems describe this grade through various images; Self, Holy Guardian Ange l, Philosopher's Stone, Universal Mind, Brahm. 1. Physical Plane: Tiphareth represents the Vision of the Harmony of Th ings, and is the point on the Tree of Life of maximum equilibration. This same formula is represented in mathematics as the Vector Equilibrium Ma trix. The Cube is a magickal symbol for Tiphareth. The VEM is an octahedron- within-a-cube, which is also the atomic structure of the diamond. 2. Astral Plane: A contemplative life in harmony with spiritual princip les becomes the primary ritual. The magical images for Tiphareth include a magickal or divine child; a resplendent king, and a sacrificed God. These represent stages in the Mystery of Death and Rebirth. Tiphareth also corresponds with the Egyptian god, Osiris. Initiation on the path to God- Realization turns one's attitudes upside-down. Devotion to the Great Work; Pride. 3. Causal Plane: In the Causal, the Vision of Harmony indicates that all spiritual progress comes through the principle of Love. It implies th e highest ethical standards in both behavior and thought. The Syntaxic Mode means one has a precise cognitive awareness concerning the relative value of mystical experiences, and has the verbal creativity for expression. Thus psychology can express in words what mystics experience through intuiti on. Syntaxic Mode includes Tantric sex, creativity, alpha states, etc. It verges of knowledge Ecstasy, but is mainly inspirational in quality. 4. Archetypal Plane: Tiphareth is the Royal Marriage of the Soul and the Lord. The projections of anima or animus have been returned to their proper level in the unconscious. The King and Queen are united: Spiri t and Soul, distinct but conjoined. The aspirant enters a period of exploration of soul by spirit for psychic fecundation. This union with the Self, uniti ng all opposites is an illumined lunacy."},{"pageNumber":1122,"pageContent":"Tiphareth represents the halfway point on the continuum of spiritual development. It indicates the ability to withdraw the attention from outside to insi de and hold it there. One contemplates the \"radiant form\" internally.

BRIAH, the Causal Plane of Universal Mind "},{"pageNumber":1123,"pageContent":"Drawing by Robert Avalon, 1976 The transition from the Astral to Causal plane of awareness is as distinct ive as that between Physical and Astral (or Imaginal). It is, however, a bit tricky to defin e since it contains \"normal ego consciousness\" as its point-of-departure. Mystical and occult literature speaks frequently of astral experience i n its various forms, but tends to jump dramatically from the beginnings of Causal experie nce to the final goal of unification. The Causal is known since ancient times as the realm of Universal Mind, Brahm, or that which binds our soul in spacetime. The Causal Plane marks the boundary where true mystical meditation m ay be begun with profit for the aspirant. The path is no longer just a desire (Y esod), a concept (Hod), nor a passion (Netzach), but a Way. In a manner of speaking, our culture has geared us to keep our expectations of realizing full human pot ential quite low. Through meditation, we can optimize our potential. The transition to the Causal Plane unites the temporal with the eternal , in as a steady rather than sporadic or emergent state. The Causal is the plane of great archetypal images or religious symbols. In the Causal, these tend to manife st to the aspirant in a very clear manner, rather than in muddled signs and misin terpreted forms of the Astral Plane. This is the fist glimmering of contact with divine spiritual forces of a higher nature. This contact comes through the mind, first in the form of creativity and l ater in a series of grace-states. We can experience a personalized knowledge and conversation with Gods and Archangels. Psychologically speaking, this means that we learn to discern the archetype at the core of situations or thought-p atterns and meaningfully dialogue with it. Particular archetypes, or godforms, are clearl y seen as animating experience. Causal-consciousness then means being able to de termine their significance and interconnectedness and have a relationship wi th them. The Briatic Plane, with its representative sphere, Tiphareth, symbol izes the central essence of manifest creation -- the Higher Self. This Self repres ents the fullest extension and potential of an individual, and provides transcendent expe riences of the highest spiritual value which come from beyond one's own personal p owers. To gain access to the Causal Plane means to transcend one's individual per sonality level and contact the inner, spiritual resources of the Self. Therefore, \"sel f\" acquires a double meaning for the aspirant which is both personal and transcendent . How do we gain access to this increased potential and inner guiding princi ple? Just as experience on the Astral required technique and practice, consci ous experience eon the Causal Plane requires the building of a \"Causal Body\" through me ditation. This Causal, or spirit-body is built of crystallized Light in the form of a \" heavenly heart.\" The building of the causal body requires that the mystic consciously atte mpt to find release from the triple-illusions of time, space and personality (or ego), through meditation -- or alternatively come to see that all existence is in fac t the body of"},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":"God. Meditation takes the place of ritual or ceremony which gave access to the Astral Plane. There is no further need for the rituals of the astral or vis ionary mode to stabilize contact with the archetype of Self. Rather, the entire life is consecrated and devoted to mystical philosophy and practice. At this level, philosophy imp lies ethics and moral living, and practice means meditation. The mystic is he who is \"in the world, but not of it.\" The Causal Plane marks the transition from procedures which we use to r each toward and contact the divine to the reception of grace. Grace is that which pulls the soul toward Kether. That which pulls the attention is grace. Mystic medi tation is fruitless without Grace. In describing the soul of man, the Qabalists have divided the soul into th ree distinct aspects, corresponding with levels of access or awareness. The astral body or personality is known as the Nepesch or emotional soul. The causal body is c alled the Ruach, or higher mind. The Neschamah or Intuition through understanding, h as the ability to pierce through the Abyss to the archetypal plane which is t he origin of divinity. Israel Regardie describes the faculties of the Causal Body in The Garden of Pomegranates: Below the Abyss is the Ruach, or Intellect, that part of one's individual consciousness which becomes aware of things, desires them, and tries to att ain them. It is a \"machine\" created, evolved, or invented by the Self for investigating the nature of the Universe. It is that portion of oneself con sisting of sensation, perceptions, and thoughts, emotions, and desires. The Ruach comprises the fourth, fifth, sixth, seven, and eighth Sephiros, whose attributions are respectively Memory, Will, Imagination, Desire and Reason. If this fantasy doe snot sound terribly altruistic, it is because this is the description of our old friend, the ego. The desires of the ego, must not only be sublimated toward spiritual goals, but must be abolished at the top end of the Causal Pl ane where it is annihilated through the crossing of the Abyss. The Ruach is the false or empirical ego. It is that part of us which names itself \"I\", and it is just that principle which is not \"I\". Its moods change with the passing of the years. More, its contents are never the same from one minute to another. The destruction of the glamorous bondage which the Ruach exerts over us, thus permitting the light of the Neschamah and the higher principl es to shine through to illumine our minds and our daily lives, is one of the all- important tasks of Mysticism. In fact, the abnegation of this false ego. . .is the essential accomplishment of all spiritual development (1). The conscious ego performs its function as an integral part of the human soul when it awakens to its task of meditation. Then it may make contact with divine forces of sufficient purity to become a channel for the spirit. This channel is formed by the human mind's perception of an Archetype of divinity. These archetypes are most"},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"commonly experienced at this level as the Self (psychology), the Holy Guardian Angel (Magick), or the Guru (mysticism). At this stage the aspirant doe s not become divinity, but actively begins to seek unity with it, through regular practice . By evolution to causal awareness, the aspirant doe snot lose access to the more ordinary levels of human experience. Rather, understanding of the relative values of the these levels is enhanced by discrimination. The aspirant leans to distinguish the level of access state by the nature of the experiences encountered when going \"inside.\" Briah is the \"World of Creation\" when considered in its relationship to th e Plane of Atziluth, but its relationship to the plane immediately below is expressed by another name. Since Yetzirah is the World of Emotion, Briah is the Intellectual W orld. This distinction is important, since Yetzirah the Astral Light, also has it s images, which are extremely numerous in view of the fact that to Yetzirah belo ng most of the forms whose origin is on the material level. Most of the images in Yetzirah are activated by emotions arising from the material world, and frequently these are of so confused a character that, although we may ascribe them in a general way to one or another Sephirah, they cannot be completely drawn into the sphere of that Sephirah and so cannot rise higher. The images in Briah, however, are truly oriented and have become linked to the Archetypes which give them a new impulse. Thereafter, they are known and contemplated by the higher human faculties. ( Denning and Phillips /Magical Philosophy) (2). In Magick, causal plane images are quite distinctively defined. The Arc hetypes are represented in Briah by the \"Magickal Images,\" which are generic repr esentations of godforms. The images are so broad-based that they may be filled our by various gods or goddesses exemplifying the particular dynamic. When we meditate, we ru n across the whole panoply of images which are 'contained' in this inner lands cape. For example, the magickal image for Tiphareth is the triple form of God-In carnate. Son of God is a composite archetype which includes three phases: 1) \"Divin e Child\"; 2) \"King of Heaven,\" or \"Solar King,\" and 3) \"Sacrificed God.\" These generic forms could be filled out by Krishna, Jesus Christ, Mithras, Os iris, or a contemporary Guru, etc. The cult-form, or specific god or goddess is a special-case event pattern ed after the generic magickal image. They share the same quality. There are some variation s, however. For example, Isis does not correspond in every respect with the B lessed Virgin Mary, though they are derived from the common theme of \"Celestial Queen.\" Magickal Images are the primary, or most fundamental, pictorial depicti ons of the qualities of the various Spheres of the Tree of Life. These images allow us t o personify each sphere with a figure appropriate to our personal, cultural and psychological background."},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"Further rarefication into non-anthropomorphic depictions of the Sphe res moves toward mathematical concepts such as sacred geometry and numerical equ ivalents. For example, Kether is know as #1, and is visualized as a brilliant poin t, while Tiphareth is #6 and represented by the six-sided cube. Personification through the magickal images opens the possibility of int ernal dialogues with the forces of the causal plane. After all, you can't talk with the number 6, nor the color yellow. One alternative is to \"become\" those essence s in imagination. Or, imagination obliges by offering an entity with a \"human\" appearance, but distinctive divine qualities. For example, in Carl Jung's personal spiritual journey, he encountered an e ntity he named Philemon. he was Jung's inner spiritual guide and a personified form of the Wise Man of Tiphareth. Philemon embodied Jung's higher self on the causal l evel of experience. By contemplating Philemon and dialoguing with him in his i magination, Jung learned things he didn't know he knew, he actualized the qualiti es of this noble Being in his daily life. he did not become Philemon, but he became relat ed to him consciously and began to integrate the potentials he expressed. Basically, our higher Self ia vision of ourselves in the future actualizing our spiritual pot ential. The magickal images for the entire Tree of Life include the following: 1. Kether.....Dazzling brilliant Light 2. Chokmah.....Bearded Patriarch, or Wise Old Man 3. Binah.....Celestial Queen, Wise Grandmother 4. Chesed.....Enthroned Priestly King (Philosopher) 5. Geburah.....Armed Warrior-King (or Judge) 6. Tiphareth.....Divine or Magickal Child, Solar King, Sacrificed God 7. Netzach.....Naked, Beautiful Woman 8. Hod.....Hermaphrodite 9. Yesod.....Viril Youth 10. Malkuth.....Veiled Maiden Qabalists associated distinct corresponding members of the spiritual hierarchy to the four planes. Each may be invoked through its Name to form an open channel of energy which descends down through the planes from above. 1). The Divine God Name corresponds with the Archetypal level of each sphere. 2). Corresponding Archangels are the entities called up on the Causal P lane. 3). Choirs of Angels are invoked on the Astral. 4). The physical planets correspond with the gross material level. Each Sphere contains all four aspects of the spiritual hierarchy. Thes e four aspects correspond in character for each Sphere and are channels of Divine energy, wh ich may be tapped. At the causal level, the seeker's mind is able to tap channels at will an d transform both himself and his environment. He does this through a correct underst anding of"},{"pageNumber":1127,"pageContent":"the nature of existence and its relationship to man's mind. The human m ind is a powerful creative tool when attention and visualization are applied under the direction of spiritual guidance. Mircea Eliade states that, To the degree that you understand a religious fact (myth, ritual, symbol, divine figure, etc.) you change, you are modified -- and this change is equivalent to a step forward in the process of self-liberation. This ability of the mind to influence reality at this level makes high eth ical standards a mandatory requirement. The causal body is a moral soul. We can develop this strong ethical stand with good role models. Otherwise as seek ers we never rise above personal ego-desires and this is the primary purpose for s eeking access to causal plane awareness. The change of plane from astral to causal is explained as symbolic Death and Rebirth. This means discipline of the mind, through with drawl of th e attention from sensory perception each day through meditation. Through this method , the mind is assigned its proper place in consciousness. Its direction pas ses from \"control\" by the ego to the higher spiritual awareness in man -- he embodie s the power of the true Self. Intellect can participate in Spirit, but is not identical with it. Mi nd must adhere to spiritual principles and disciplines despite personal pain-pl easure cycles. Consistency of effort helps develop integration of the personality with t he higher Self. The mystic creates this integrated subtle body by concentrating atten tion at the eye center. The energy normally is flowing outward into the senses or world. It m ust be withdrawn or made to 'flow backward'. This is the 'death\" of the sense s. Then comes the eternal moment of enlightenment when thoughts cease. Th is is the \"death of the mind.\" The aspirant is \"reborn\" when his attention goes sin and t he radiant Light is perceived. He merges with this Light in enlightenment of the causal level. The causal body is formed by the fixation and crystallization of this living L ight. This symbol of the Self is an undivided point which is present in ever y man, but realized in spiritual persons. Surrounding the point with a circle sym bolizing wholeness yields the glyph of the Sun, symbol of Tiphareth as represent ative of the causal plane. Tiphareth is the spiritual-gate to the causal plane, and the sou l's method of transportation is the causal, or \"Diamond-Body.\" M. Esther Harding describes this causal, or heart-level development in The I and the Not-I : This is the stage in the development of consciousness depicted in Tantric Yoga as the heart level, where for the first time a light is lighted in the he art, so that one is no longer dependent only on reflected light, but can at last see directly ; that is, one sees through the projections to the reality of the other person and at the same time becomes aware, dimly and fleetingly, at first, of the god within,"},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"whose guiding light makes it possible for one to see beyond one's own ego, to see the other as from the inside, that is, to see him/her as also a whole person. Of course, this is a psychological interpretation of the heart-level, which is directed toward interpersonal relationships, rather than intrapsychic ones. Many modes of personal development allow us to realize the meaning and poten tial represented by the Spheres of the Tree of Life with its Four Planes of Consciousness. Eliade put it succinctly in his journal, No Souvenirs . If, due to one's desiring a woman (man), one begins to live more intensely, if one becomes a poet, or if one rises to a level inaccessible up to then, etc -- it is a matter of indifference to know that all this is due to physiological or psycho- mental processes. What is of interest is to be able to rise to a level never attained, to live as a mature and responsible man, to write poems, in a word, to participate in the life of the Spirit. The \"causes\" which have helped us to open ourselves to the Spirit are unimportant. A. Tiphareth, Sphere of the Sun and the Son Full Consciousness You are carrying me, full consciousness, god that has desired all through the world. Here, in this third sea, I almost hear your voice; your voice, the wind, freeing entirely all movements; eternal colors and eternal lights, sea colors and sea lights. Your voice of white fire in the universe of water, the ship, the sky, marking out the roads with delight, engraving for me with a blazing light my firm orbit: a black body with glowing diamond in its center. --Juan Ramon Jimenez Tiphareth, as the Sphere of the Sun, means different experiences on di ffering levels of awareness. In summary, they might be seen as the following: 1). Tiphareth of the Physical Plane is \"normal\" ego consciousness; 2). Tiphareth of the Astral Plane is a vision of the radiant form of the Self; 3). Tiphareth of the Causal Plane means crystallization of the subtle Diamond Body, Self-Realization, Individuation, or creation of the Philosopher's Stone;"},{"pageNumber":1129,"pageContent":"4). Tiphareth of the Archetypal Plane means nothing less than the incarnation of a Son of God, in the form of a spiritual Master. The states of consciousness which Tiphareth corresponds with range fr om normal ego consciousness to the beginning of mystical practice in meditation (wit h its altered state of time transcendence). There are three distinct levels in the domain of the Syntaxic Mode or \"Creativity\". Tiphareth is the lowest level of this mode of consciousness. It expresses more cognitive awareness; the mind appr ehends directly, rather than having bodily reactions or imaginal lapses where the ego dissociates . The ego can now participate in the soul's relationship to the Divine. Tiphareth means Divine Beauty, Equilibrium, Compassion and Creativity. Tak en together, these qualities imply harmony or rhythm of proportions such as th ose expressed in the geometrical form of the Golden Mean, and the ethical di ctum known as the Golden Rule. Both suggest balance and the application of proper force and form. These rules express a ratio of appropriateness. Tiphareth is the qabalistic equivalent of the Self, or the divinity of t he Macrocosm made manifest. Tiphareth is a divine microcosm, the mythical heaven of m any religions. It represents the return of a sense of wholeness and holin ess. Since it is the only Sphere which has direct access to all other Spheres of the Tree of E ternal Life, Tiphareth forms its heart, or sacred center. Consciousness states \"follow\" one another in an ascending hierarchy of in creasing integration. There is steady increase in control of one's environment throu gh increased visualization ability. This power must be used with wisdom and restraint or it will become a major stumbling block to further progress. There are two higher stages of the Syntaxic Mode. If Tiphareth is characteri zed as Creativity, Daath is characterized as Psychedelia or Mystic Ecstasy, and Ket her is the Unitive Stage. One's encounters with the Divine or collective unconscious become m ore inspirational and uplifting and less frightening or awesome. There i s still a great sense of awe; one just doesn't go into a trance state to experience it. There is, nevertheless, a profound metamorphosis of the soul. Tiphareth is the begi nning of the mind's expansion from normal awareness to the Infinite. The degree s of this expansion, as the soul liberates itself from the mind, may be broken dow n into various procedures and grace states. According to Gowan (1975), the Creative level of the Syntaxic Mode includes five procedures: 1. Tantric Sex: level of intimacy 2. Creativity: level of generation and Individuation 3. Biofeedback: level of generating Alpha Waves at will 4. Orthocognition: level of consciously willing potential to manifest, cre ative visualization, ego integrity 5. Meditation: level of disciplined consistency and time transcendenc e."},{"pageNumber":1130,"pageContent":"Each of these may be examined in turn to determine their role in the growt h of spirituality or transformation of the individual. 1. Tantric Sex does not necessarily mean you must become a Buddhist monk. T antra is used here as the spiritual bliss of losing oneself in the unity of l ove. The union of Shiva and Shakti is a metaphor expressing the most sacred aspect of marriage ( as does that of Krishna and Radha). It is a mere hint of the ecstasies of higher m ystical experiences. Sex is holy, in that while embracing, the lovers achieve a whole ness, a union of opposites, in which they share on the most primordial psychophysi cal levels. The ego is dissolved in the bliss of merging, prefiguring the unio n of the personal with the Divine. In this manner, sex functions as an aspect of devel opment toward individuation, or realizing and embodying one's highest nature. Sexual activity, motivated by unselfish love is an ordinary act with the unsuspecte d benefit of contributing to the self-actualization of the marriage partners. Their ac t embodies the masculine and feminine polarities of the Universe emb racing one another. 2. Creativity. Since there was obviously creativity in the Parataxic Mode of Art, what distinguishes this stage from that? Art is the level of intuitive apprehension of pictorial images. This level means verbal creativity, which is an intuitive form of the next level of Psychedelia (Daath). Creativity is verbal because the informat ion coming from the preconscious is understood by the mind. At this stage, we not only understand our own psychology pretty well, we can also verbalize about our condition. Having named our demons (mother complex, puer complex, negative senex, etc.) we win to a certain stage of conscious realization in the process of individuation. When such a degree of mental health is achieve d through one method or another, creativity will inevitably emerge. Freed from the stress of an overemotional reactivism, a person flowers through various modes of self-expression. This indicates a fluid relationship between the i ndividual's ego and preconscious. Verbal creativity is marked by proficiency at analogy and metaphor. To be able to create these implies the ability to see through to underlying similari ties in the dissimilar. The beginnings of the creative process lie in introspection on inform ation previously assimilated. This may take many forms, such as focusing on a problem and studyin g all angles of it, with various repercussions. After preparation and incubat ion, an illumination, or answer to the problem may suddenly occur. Its application will show if it is a true answer, or can be verified as useful. Creativity is part of the basis of philosophy in that it raises problems or questions, which it seeks to r esolve through verbal creativity. Gowan lists several theories concerning creativity, and the powers and vir tues of verbal and mathematical creativity. He asserts that creativity has cognitive , rational and semantic aspects. Other aspects of creativity are personal or environme ntal, or"},{"pageNumber":1131,"pageContent":"stem from a certain psychological openness. The inspiration for creativity c omes from the ability of the ego to access the contents of the collective precon scious. Activity directed in this manner leads to high well-being and self-act ualization. Understanding increases along with creative organization. One gains in abili ty to combine the familiar in new and innovative ways. To be truly creative requ ires at least four traits according to Fromm: \"capacity to be puzzled, ability to conc entrate, capacity to accept conflict, and willingness to be reborn everyday.\" Maslow extended creative traits to include \"spontaneous, expressive, effor tless, innocent, unfrightened by the unknown or ambiguous, able to accept tentati veness and uncertainty, able to tolerate bipolarity, able to integrate opposites.\" Whel an (1965) added, \"energy, autonomy, confidence, openness, preference for complexit y,\" etc. Creativity also brings a sense of destiny and personal worth. This brings a sense of joy, contentment and acceptance of self, which show its transformative abi lity. Creative people, who accept themselves, also have the further ability for co mpassion or brotherly love, (agape). Gowan concludes that \"creativity has a holistic quality, which restores the balance between right and left hemisphere function, between analog and digital computer aspects of thinking...Man's mind is a device for bringing infinite mind in to manifestation in time; creativity is the commencement of this actuali zation.\" 3. Biofeedback (Alpha Wave Training) has become fairly common in recent years as a medical tool to teach patients to regulate blood pressure, for stress red uction, migraines, etc. Through perception of tones or lights the participant lear ns to enter a particular subjective state which is associated with the production of brain waves in the 8-13 hertz region. These brain waves are called Alpha Waves. A more relaxed state produces theta waves in 4-8 hertz frequencies. This training appears to simulate the meditative state of yogis and Zen mast ers. Through the use of the biofeedback apparatus, the technique is more qu ickly learned, through application of concentration and will. What is required i s a passive attention coupled with physical relaxation. Then one achieves a feeling of har mony between inner and outer worlds. Biofeedback is linked to creativity, in that, through this technique on e may gain access to a reverie state or waking dream where there is vivid percept ual imagery. Yet one retains enough awareness to bring back these images coming out of th is reverie or Theta state. In dream research, this phase of consciousness is termed hypnogogic imagery. The ability to visualize is directly related to creativity. I n this state one may go into a mode which is a sort of \"internal scanning,\" finding cre ative solutions to problems or stimulating imagery. Very advanced forms of biofeedback training are available now for the home computer. The effective range of these programs includes stress manag ement, balancing the personality, changing habits and behavior patterns, auto-hypnosis , and self-transformation."},{"pageNumber":1132,"pageContent":"Application of programs to Qabalistic purposes has been called \"Yogatronics \" or \"Electro-Magick\" by Miller & Miller. This new generation of video games cou ld include pre-programmed pathworking designed to help the aspirant in ternalize the symbolism presented in QBL, while developing the visualization abili ty. We have all the potential of experiencing certain types of 'astral journeys\" using the medium of \"the temple of living light.\" The monitor has the capacity to hold the visuali zation until the aspirant can learn to internalize the symbols and visualize th em at will. In this case, hardware may be dispensed with. The interface is merely a teaching tool. In this way, classical mind-control techniques can be used to fine-tu ne oneself, in the same sense as self-hypnosis. This is the basis of effectiveness of b iofeedback and other elementary forms of meditation. It allows access to states of awareness w ithout the interference and side-effects of drugs, or the years of intensive p ractice in yoga. Meditation, in its elementary form, is described as an altered state of awar eness that is induced by repetitive action of some constant stimulation. This sti mulation may be of three types: 1) external, such as a chant or drum beat or visual display; 2) internal, such as mental repetition of a word or group of words; or, 3) physical, su ch as an electronic stimulus, etc. Even without religious intent, an individual, under the influence of this constant stimulation, is able to achieve varying degrees of relaxation and learn a degree of control over autonomic nervous system functions. This enhances the quali ty of life and widens the spectrum of human experiences available on the psychologic al level. We can create the conditions necessary for personal creativity by providing a da ily \"incubation\" period. We appear to also gain a better understanding of ourselve s. Many feel they experience an expansion of consciousness and gain access to high er levels of awareness. This equilibrium produces the experience of one ness with the universe, or contact with the divine. There are many styles of meditation from different philosophical school s, but they all share certain elements in common. The active techniques employ conc entration prior to contemplation, and are quite similar to self-hypnosis in the i nduction phase. Most are designed primarily to create a light alpha brain-wave state, with dee per meditation stages producing Theta patterns (ideal conditions for rejuve nation). Our Videographics program of meditation begins with the eyes open. At this stage, meditation is effective with the eyes either opened or closed. The goal of t he Videographics program is to teach us the matrix pattern of optimal equilibr ium, so it may be internalized eventually. Once the pattern is learned, the state s recognizable, it is possible to visualize anywhere at any time. When an individual concentrates on an external object, it is called contemp lative meditation. In Eastern systems of Yoga, the object of concentration is known as a Yantra. If the object is a circular design radiating from a center, it is call ed a mandala. Variations on the theme used throughout the world include the cr ucifix, the Star of David, flowers, candle flames, etc. Eventually, the symbol is mental ly"},{"pageNumber":1133,"pageContent":"fixed on a spot inside the center of the forehead, known as the \"third eye\" (i.e. the pineal gland). Simultaneously with the visualization, one mentally repeats a word or phrase used in a repetitive manner to induce a meditative state. This word is known as a mantra. The \"meaning\" of this word has been scientifically \"proven\" to be arbit rary, but some feel it is best to use a mantra which is a symbol of one's chosen deity. I n the qabalistic tradition, mantra meditation was practiced using permutation s of the Hebrew letters of the Name of God. This relates the mystical meaning of t he mantra to the individual and contains more power to influence the soul. Mantra meditation is similar to self-hypnotic suggestion, since it provi des an internally-originating method of repetitive stimulation to the central nervous system. It encourages the development of a hypnotic trance, where one is mo re suggestible. It is at this point you can re-program yourself out of undesirable habit patterns. Some techniques suggest it is necessary to repeat the mant ra only upon exhalation of the breath, to induce the relaxation response. Expected results of this technique include a deep state of physical an d mental relaxation. Faster reaction times, greater self-sufficiency, stabili ty and happiness have also been shown as results of regular meditation practice. There are n o inherent dangers for the \"normal\" individual. However, for a highly neuroti c person unstressing might release pent up emotional problems, precip itating psychosomatic symptoms or inappropriate behavior. Marathon meditation peri ods are discouraged as they can lead to a loss of the sense of reality. Furthermore, t he mind will later rebel and be even harder to calm. On the plus side, medit ation reduces anxiety and negative self-image which can reduce psychosomati c disorders. It is a natural high. 4. Orthocognition. Gowan has termed the next stage of expansion of ability orthocognition, which he defines as an understanding of the illusions of time, space, and personality and their relationship to the divine element. It repre sents \"the first dawning of complete cognitive understanding\" of the processes of the psyche. For this to happen, the mind needs \"a map of the psychic terrain, and an awarenes s that such relationships exist.\" The effectiveness of Qabalistic theory in this regard is clear. QBL is n ot only a correct map of the psychic terrain, it prevents us from confusing the l evels of experience and getting lost in fruitless tangents. Pathworking prevent s us from getting lost in endless mazes of psychological confusion concerning the re lative value of different experiences. We stay on the right track or path of the Tree by corr ectly visualizing our relationship to it. QBL is a variation on the theme of the Per ennial Philosophy, which recognizes all-powerful, impersonal forces which exis t independent of time, space and human will, and are beneficient and con cerned with human welfare and spiritual development. Orthocognition is a low stage of syntaxic mode conceptualization and still con tains an element of selfish personal desire. Therefore, we should be extre mely careful to"},{"pageNumber":1134,"pageContent":"limit visualization to those embodying the highest standards. The power to vis ualize means we have the ability to manifest our ideal self-concept, and this is the main purpose of orthocognition when it is used in conjunction with meditati on. We should seek to actualize the Lord's Will, not our person will. Remember, the p ersonal ego is an illusion to begin with, and personal desires just compound the dist ortion of reality. If this realization does not come, one is hung up at this stage for an in definite period of time. Thoughts are things, or may become manifest, and the human mind is a powerful tool for shaping reality on several levels. Since every intentional act is a magic kal act, we must learn to use emergent powers wisely and with restraint, or w e bleed off motivational energy to experience higher states of awareness. Visualizati on releases or taps the flow of psychic energy, transforming potential into being. Several philosophies hold that our imagination and perception is responsible for the maintenance of the universe; our presence is a necessary part of its real ization. According to Gowan, \"orthocognition is a form of mental dimensional orientation \" which \"is related to the structure of intellect factor of spatial visu alization. The ability to orient oneself in three dimensional space can be developed in to the ability to orient oneself outside space and time, and hence to possess the means f or transcending the illusion they present.\" (see 'The Diamond Body and C irculation of the Light,' this Volume). The orthocognitive person would have an effective working knowledge of p hysics, physiology, psychology and metaphysics. This philosophical basis provides a cognitive capacity which keeps pace with affective experience. In other words, one understands the meaning of various states of consciousness or mystical expe rience, as well as apprehending them intuitively. This is why psychology can descr ibe states of consciousness in words. Below the grace states of ecstasy and unificati on, they may be very precisely defined by those with verbal creativity.. Healing, whether mental or physical (actually psychophysical) is a special c ase of orthocognition. Gowan describes three kinds of healers: 1. Those who lay on hands work in prototaxic mode or 'trance.\" 2. Those who form images in the right hemisphere, or visualizers, work parataxically. 3. Syntaxic healers operate through the word. Though separated by degrees of ability and swiftness of cure, these include masters like Jesus, or modern day psychologists with their talking and experiential therapies. He concludes that, \"the essence of psychic healing is a speed-up in tim e of what would normally be accomplished in a much longer period. What we are really witnessing, therefore, is the acceleration of chemical reactions. If ul timate reality exists outside of time, and if orthocognition is the dawning recognition of th is fact, the consequent psychic healing, as an accelerated physical process would f ollow immediately upon this principle.\" ( TAC , pg. 332)."},{"pageNumber":1135,"pageContent":"Elsewhere (Psychoenergetic Systems, Krippner, 1979), Gowan draws paral lels between creativity, healing, and illumination (or peak experiences). Al l three procedures share common traits. These include a prelude ritual whic h includes a withdrawal to internal solitude, an altered state of consciousness dur ing the peak of the experience, and an emotional \"afterglow\" after the experience. These three states apply to all the procedures of Tiphareth. Briefly t hese are characterized as follows: 1. Prelude Ritual. \"This consists of a number of steps, some of which may be left out or practiced unconsciously in any given case. First, there is a tri gger (a physical problem in the case of healing, an unsolved issue in the case of creativity). The protagonist seeks solitude undisturbed; one concentrates on one's thought with a fixed purpose, calling or invoking some transpersonal power or must with full expectation of results. The peak-experience illumination differs only in that the entire process is largely uncon scious.\" 2. Altered State. \"It is far from trance even in the \"wild\" (or spontaneous ) peak-experience. It is, in the other two modes, far more within conscious control, but it is still not your ordinary state of consciousness, for one is in some measure conscious of the Absolute -- outside time and space. Once the prototype of the solution is sensed there, it is experienced as vibrations, whic h grow into mental images, ideas instantaneously flow (\"rhea-ceptivity\"), t hey are clothed in a form which must be committed to paper at once lest they vanish, and finally, suddenly, the altered state ends. In healing, having been visualized by the healer, the perfect conditions is manifested in the patient: in cr eativity the new products has been \"realized\" in verbal or artistic form; in illumi nation the experience is ineffable and hence is felt only as overload on the emotions .\" 3. Postlude. \"The postlude experience is one of beneficient emotions, joy, reassurance, exaltation, oneness, and goodness. ...one or more of the steps may be unconscious or omitted altogether in any given circumstance. Some of the se events are more intense than others, and the spontaneous ones tend to be more ecstatic than those \"on demand,\" but these statements are equally true of sexual intercourse, for experience breeds equanimity.\" 5. Mystical Meditation. This is the final procedure of Syntaxic Mode. Paradoxi cally, this is a fully cognitive exercise, but it stills the mind, preparing it for the influx of grace states (Daath). meditation with a religious or spiritual goal marks the upper limit of mankind's mental efforts. From this point on, further progre ss depends on the downflowing of the Grace of Divine higher power. One can make the cons cious effort to establish this condition, but its manifestation requires t he activation of processes beyond conscious control. The mind must be tranquilized, stilled or made silent. In other word s, this type of meditation is an attempt by the aspirant to transcend the limitations of even the highest possibilities of the mind. By consciously cooperating, the mind seeks to transcend itself, but it cannot do this without aid from that which is Beyond itself."},{"pageNumber":1136,"pageContent":"The \"I-Not I\" split expresses the essential duality of man in his alien ation from his Divine Origin. The entire process of transformation along the Middle Pil lar of the Tree of Life is an attempt to heal this split through the medium of an I-S elf dialogue. this interchange is brought into increasing conscious awareness as one asce nd the spheres, path and planes of the Tree. This duality enabled man to experien ce the birth of consciousness, but on the Way of Return, the mind must be stille d to quietness for the primordial reunion to occur. The mind must merge back into its source, Universal Mind, in order to free the soul for greater glories. In QBL, the I-Self duality, with its resulting fragmentation of qualit ies into spheres, is resolved by consistent ascent up the Middle Pillar. As One unites or harmonizes the various opposite spheres on the Tree, awareness gains access to higher le vels. A similar process occurs in alchemy, where the opposites must be unite d to produce the supreme symbol, the Philosopher's Stone. The process required i s a dialogue between the conscious-I and the unconscious-Self. This is known i n psychology as the process of self-analysis. It has its own analogy in yogic training. In the modes of \"trance\" and \"art,\" man has an I-It relationship with the subconscious. Upon entering the mental dimension, however, the subc onscious is spontaneously perceived in a personified form, making possible the I- Self dialogue, on a conscious level. In Magick, this phase is the Knowledge and Conversation w ith one's Holy Guardian Angel. In contact with this inner radiant form of the Sel f, one may put direct questions to it and receive direct answers, guiding life a nd the growth process. The Self of the I-Thou relationship is perceived as Divi ne Guidance. The Self is another name for the Absolute, which is seen at Tiphareth, t hough one cannot merge with it until Kether. Instead, the absolute is seen refl ected in the manifestations of the physical world. The goal of the dialogue is to infuse t he personal self with the infinite depth of the greater Self. this prod uces feelings of bliss and expansion in understanding and wisdom. According to most philosoph ical systems, the original purpose of the \"I\" or ego-consciousness is to know the universe. Ultimately,, the knower merges with the known in the realm of the Self. The Self is the ordering and unifying principle which guides the process of spiritual development. The dialogue cannot begin until the conscious I perceives t he Self as a separate center, or essence of manifest reality. Initiation of the I-Self dialogue manifests a connection between the t wo which is analogous to Middle Pillar. This connection is known in psychology as the \"I-Se lf axis,\" as termed by Edward Edinger in his book on the subject, Ego and Archetype . There is another type of union with the Self, which is more pertinen t to meditation than psychology. This is the method of \"transcendence,\" where a clear di stinction between ego and self is not required. Instead, the boundaries of the per sonality are gradually expanded, merging with the infinite boundaries, formed by the Se lf perceived as an infinite circumference. These two different modes of experiencing Self, dialogue and transcend ence, function through different physiological systems. Dialogue includes ps ychology and"},{"pageNumber":1137,"pageContent":"magick and involves the enflamment or arousal system. Transcendence come s through diffusion and stilling of the body. Enflamment works through noradrenaline production, while transcendence is associated with the neurotransmitter, serotonin. Either technique can lead to the fulfillment of Tiphareth, which is Self-Realization or Individuation. This phase marks the culmination of the process of self -analysis, and returns the soul to its pristine state of self-luminosity. This is the feeling of oneness with God, but this is only an illusion for it is merely the halfw ay house on the road to spiritual fulfillment, half way up the mountain. But, in and of itself, it is a great spiritual accomplishment, and can mark the beginning of the second h alf of the journey to God-Realization or knowledge of God. Both spirit and God share a common essence. Perfected consciousness means no less that the synthesis of I and Sel f which results in bliss. Without this union, the soul remains in an ever-restless cond ition, feeling the pain of its separation. What is required at this stage is for mind to reali ze itself as pure, undifferentiated Essence. When no thoughts arise and the mind is fixed on pure Essence, there can be no lingering notion of an individual ego. Ego doe s not even experience itself having the realization, nor doe sit perceive the ph enomena occurring. One simply is ...not becoming, but Being. Psychological realization comes with the repetition of the psychic life cycle. When one is freed from the compulsive repetition, a sense of wholeness is ac hieved. This sense of wholeness is symbolized by Tiphareth, however, Perfection is k nown as Kether. Edinger defines three phases in I-Self relations. In the first, th e I becomes inflated (ego trip) due to identification with the powers and potencies of Self . By amassing personal power and asserting its independence, the ego falls out of harmony w ith the subconscious. This stage is alienation. Alienation brings the ego pain and remorse, coupled with a sacrificial attitude (\"I'll never do THAT again. \") It seeks reconnection to the previous harmonious condition, a reconciliation or reacceptance. Repeating the cycle brings increased awareness until th e process is conscious, and becomes obsolete, since the I merges with Self in medit ation daily. Methods of transcendence include relaxing the body and withdrawing atte ntion from the senses. One must sit in a position where it is easy to relax but hard to fall asleep. undisturbed, with eyes closed, one may begin the process o rela xing the mind and removing the constant babble of distracting thoughts. The mind constant ly repeats scenes and stories of its attachment to the outer world. To overcome this tendency, a mantra, or repetition of the divine names is used to control the mind. A sound or tone may also be employed for this purpose, of eliminating distracting thoughts. To fix the attention one uses contemp lation. The form of contemplation is usually a symbol of the Self (one's Guru, mandala, Holy Guardian Angel, or Wise Old Man or Woman). These are imaging techniques which hold the mind on the proper thought. All these forms ultimately merge i nto mystical"},{"pageNumber":1138,"pageContent":"perception of inner Light, and then this Light is contemplated effor tlessly because it automatically holds the attention. Sounds may also be heart at this time with t he inner healing. This sound and the light are of the same essence, they are one in the same as your attention. This process unfolds over time, and meditation, as other magickal procedu res, must be carried our without \"lust for results\" or expectations. You must wal k before you can run. In the lower level of meditation, one must battle the distraction s, but in the higher level meditation is sheer bliss for the inner pull drives the process. The bliss which one accesses through the bridge of meditation can become as habitu al or addictive as self-destructive behaviors. Meditation allows an individual direct access to his higher nature with all of its concomitant benefits. This proces s of unfoldment continues at even higher levels of consciousness.. (i.e. Daath and Kether). Some techniques of meditation include Transcendental meditation, Zen, Vedanta, Integral Yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Surat Shabd Yoga, union of the soul with the sound current. Each has a slightly different motivation, and some have diff erent goals, in that the goals of some yogas are higher than those of others. Some seek to united with Universal Mind, while others transcend it. Stilling th e mind is a rewarding experience since it brings feelings of tranquility. But, i t is merely preparation for something greater to come. One may continually clean a chalice , but it will get dirty again if it isn't filled with the life-giving water. T iphareth is the stage of purification or rebirth. Gowan points our that \"unlike creativity which seeks a social response to s olve a problem, and orthocognition, which seeks some personal relief or benefi t, meditation seeks no product beyond itself. It therefore is the only proce dure to gain independence from the ego.\" It is, however, as far as man can go through his own efforts. Meditation is man's invitation to God -- a silent plea for Grace. Gowan feels that the Syntaxic Mode has great relevance for personal and cultur al growth. \"The whole stage with its five procedures is therefore of inten se interest to the intelligent, educated adult. It forms an indispensable bridge to grow th and self- actualization for our culture, and constitutes the only method of making ready f or, or, understanding the phenomena of the psychedelic stage.\" (Daath). Gowan concludes that, \"It is the business of the ego to attend to ordinary reali ty; it is the business of other parts of the psyche to relate to non-ordinary reali ty, that is, the noumenon outside our space and time. While we may look at our ordinary reality as \"real,\" it is actually the other way around, for it is non-ordinary reali ty that is the ultimate real.\" [table: properties of syntaxic procedures and grace s] 1. PHILOSOPHY A. INITIATION: Minor Adept"},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"Adeptus Minor corresponds to Tiphareth. This ceremony is the death and resurrection rite of the Sun. It is generally held that Tiphareth is th e highest attainment in earthly life; it is certainly the highest recognized G rade, since whatever further progress an Adept may make is by his private work. Furthermore, the Grades 6=5 and 7=4 represent such a degree of spiritual attainment, and the sense of responsibility pertaining thereto is so great, th at such Exalted Ones have no wish to be known and proclaimed. --Denning & Phillips/The Magickal Philosophy, Vol. III Integration, the final attribute of escalation, synthesizes the others. It is in some respects the mathematical integral of the previous aspects. A mathematical integral of an algebraic function is a related function of the next higher degree with the addition of a constant which must be determined by observation, thu s giving two sources of extra freedom and one of greater complexity. It is not surprising that a higher synthesis, greater complexity and new degrees of freedom are characteristic properties of the concept of integration. ...The tasks of a stage are not simple accretions of the previous stages, but are interconnected to form a meaningful unit...which unites into a gestalt. ...Integration also embraces a higher synthesis of already delineated elements ; hence it summates the concept of escalation. ...This top efficiency at any st age of development is reached only through a harmonious psychic-biologic relationship resulting from excellent mental health on the part of the i ndividual which enables him to integrate his total potential, or as we say in current slang, to \"put it all together.\" --John Curtis Gowan/ Development of the Psychedelic Individual The grade of Minor Adept might be considered analogous to completion of an under-graduate program in a four-year college, and entrance into a graduate program. When one enters the Ph.D. program of spirituality, the one has stil l only an awakened realization of potential godhood. When one first attain the Tiphar eth initiation, one exemplifies the archetype of the Divine Child, who must learn to walk before he can run. The vital ingredient is a conscious realization of one's d istress, which activates the archetype of unity, providing an increasing sense of centeredness. Having undergone the previous phases of personality development and integrat ion, the adept has gained self-knowledge which has extended the boundar ies of the ego- personality. He must now implement his new attitudes in practice as a s ynthesis of his training. In this manner, one is able to embody the solar glory of the archetype of the Resplendent King, the self-actualized, or individuated person. B y transforming oneself into a purified personality, one is redeemed from t he dictates of the senses and the lower mind. The individual whose personality is so purified and redeemed has be come an altogether different creature than homo sapien. These individuals fore shadow mankind's next evolutionary change, and might be termed homo mysticus, or"},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"mystical man (Neumann). Alternatively, they might be termed homo novus, or n ew man (Richards and Richards), or homo lumen (Philo Stone). The term, homo lum en would indicate those individuals actively engaged in the crystallization of t he \"body of light,\" on the Causal Plane. The \"homo lumen\" represents a consciousness which actualizes the di vine nature of the Macrocosm in the Microcosm. This does not mean that the ego will no lon ger confront problems which challenge one's moral courage. In fact, the battle wi th the downward pull of the mind is enjoined on an even more intense level . Rationalizations and conflicts will arise to deter one's progress in def iance of one's heart-felt will. Only consistency of effort will overcome this extraord inary difficulty. This phase frequently involves actual strengthening of the will-powe r or ego which has a weak sense of responsibility. This is why the individuation proc ess up to Tiphareth is characterized as being \"heroic\" in nature. We all need some e go strength to survive in the world, and without it we would be overpowere d by the awesome strength of the unconscious Self at this stage. What is required is an integration of consciousness and Self. By making the conflict conscious, the ego assumes a heavy responsibility. This problem is impossible to solve without divine guidance. There are certain indicators of progress at this stage, as delineated by john Gowan (1974) in his Northridge Developmental Scale. He determined a series of m ini-tasks which are considered \"requirement\" or results of self-actualizat ion, using criteria other than intelligence testing. Some of these include creativity, self -reliance, self acceptance, problem-solving ability, a sense of destiny, and a strong inward tendency toward meditation. (For a more complete description of these stages, see \"Psychological Models,\" this volume, on developmental theory, or Syntaxic Mode). An individual at this stage understands the phenomena of projection, and realizes that heavens and hells originate within himself. Mystical meditation is a fundamental category of human experience. Mystic al types of experience can manifest whenever the ego defers to the unconscious, gi ving up its illusion of occupying the center of human awareness. There are stages of m ystical- type experiences, depending on one's conscious awareness. The mystical experience of the most primitive sort (prototaxic) is cal led participation mystique. Here the ego identifies itself unconsciou sly with the divine. This produces a feeling of paradisiacal wholeness. Further development of a heroic ego leads to greater clarity of the relationship of the ego to the Self. Forme rly unconscious aspects of the non-ego are raised to conceptual understandin g. The worldview is transformed. The dynamism of this process comes from the Self, not the ego. The creative Self is a mystical force which lives within us all, but to realize it require s a personal encounter. At the Tiphareth stage this personal encounter occurs i n meditation. This means mystical meditation (not elementary meditation), which se eks God- realization as its goal."},{"pageNumber":1141,"pageContent":"Prior to consistent mystical meditation, the dynamic aspect of the creat ive Self may manifest with the hint of a religious aura in ideas, inspirations, or even wi th the power of revelations. These ideas and inspirations may contain great spiritu al truths, but since they originate in the mind, they may also be contaminated, or inclined to lead one astray through misinterpretation. In spiritual prac tice, all images or directions experienced during meditation must be tested or dismissed. Only that which ultimately remains is Truth. All others are mere prod ucts of the mind, and can capture the attention if allowed to do so. Mystical meditation is a method of producing metamorphosis in both th e ego and the Self. When the ego is attentive and devoted to the Self, the mystical en counter may occur. This yields a lasting transformation of the personality. The mysti c seeks to be freed from the imprisonment of a rigid ego, and isolation in time and space. Depending upon one's level of awareness, there are early, high, and ultimat e levels of mystical experience. They reflect stages of human development. According to Erich Neumann (\"Mystical Man\", Eranos Yearbook, Princeton Univ. Press, p. 375-415): The final and mature phase of human and personal development, which reaches beyond the zenith of the dominant ego-consciousness, is characteriz ed by metamorphosis and integration of the personality, such as we see in the process of individuation. This too, is prefigured in myth, in the archetypal figure of Osiris. As the sun rises and falls in its path across the sky, so does consciousness develop in every individual as the ages of life unfold, and individuation is the end of its diurnal arc. The metamorphosis of the Horus = sun = ego of this phase, stands under the sign of Osiris, the \"First of the Westerly gods.\" At the end and death of the sun's course, Osiris, the self, receives and Osirifies the ego = Horus = son and transforms him into the sel f. The mythology and king ritual of the Egyptians contain many accounts of the paradoxical relation between ego and self, Horus and Osiris. The mystery of mysteries: \"I and the Father are one,\" also presides over this final phase of the transformation that is called individuation and which culminates in th e death of the ego and the end of life. The mystery of Death and Rebirth is the stage of Tiphareth. It may intimate n ot only the transmigration of the soul through several personalities, but also b e a mystical prescription to \"Die Daily\" in mystical meditation, as the ego mer ges with the greater whole. One must have certain qualities of a minor adept in order to do this. One needs some degree of ego integration, or one's mystical practice is a timid fleeing from the world. This is a regression of the ego, no progression towards consummation in spiritual marriage. The myth of the hero culminates in a divinely strengthened ego, which manifests some qualities of the divine. The hero has a calling or mission, or a sense of his or her own destiny, as does th e minor adept. He forms and transforms his/her own worldview, constantly wi dening the parameters of experience. The hero is the rising son-sun or divine c hild. When"},{"pageNumber":1142,"pageContent":"the son/sun reaches the zenith point, there is a stabilization of consci ousness or self- actualization. Then begins the path of ecstatic, or high mysticism, where the sacrif ice of the ego or individuality is enacted in the archetype of the sacrificed god. The ego wil lingly participates in its own destruction through transcendence. It acknow ledges the Self as the directing center. Creativity is entirely directed inwardly and upwardly. The direction is inward in terms of attention, and upwards in terms of plane s of awareness as described in Qabala. A high mystic is not concerned with transforming the world, per se, but th is is a natural by product of his teachings. Both high magick or high mysticism ar e roads for the redemption of the soul, and the realization of the macrocosm in the microcosm of human life. Great individuals act as role models for humility an d the spiritual development of mankind. The personal and spiritual integrit y which they embody links them with the westernmost portion of the solar journey. Thei r personal integrity, first hand knowledge of the borderline of death, and their after- death mysticism links them with the archetype of Osiris, the dying and r esurrecting god. In these illumined individuals, the reality of the self shines thr ough transparently. Even though we have a role model for wholeness, each individual soul needs t o confront the task of redeeming his soul. This requires personal effort, an d this is the work of the minor adept in mystical meditation. magickal transformation of the personality into living light is a continuous creative process, and is the mai n work of this phase. The integrated person is attached to his or her own creative ce nter, and that core is represented as Tiphareth, the center of the mandala, or the he avenly heart. The minor adept seeks to consolidate discontinuous encounters with th e self into a mystical transparence which \"resembles and all-embracing radiation of the self, and the ego encounters the numinous everywhere and at all times.\" He engage s in mystical meditation which includes a dialogue between the ego and Self , in some form of spiritual practice on a regular basis. This dialogue provides guidanc e for the ego, which then transforms itself into an embodiment of the self. Again from Neumann (p. 415): Thus from it earliest beginnings the human personality is in constant mystical motion. Reaching inwardly toward the self and outwardly toward the world in ever-new encounters, forever changing, man from childhood onward passes through all the stages of transformation mysticism. And just as the begin ning of source mysticism extends back into an unknown sphere prior to the emergence of the ego, so does the end of immortality mysticism extend into an unknown realm beyond the extinction of the ego.

Su ch is Love, the Mystic Flower of the Soul. This is the Center, the Self.\" C.G. Jung PREFACE Welcome to my world--a world ensouled and enlivened by imagery. A world of t he seemingly familiar, yet peculiarly mysterious. In our modern culture every image, mundane or divine, has been used and abu sed. In the Postmodern Era there is no new iconography. In imagery and art, there is nothing new under the Sun. Everything which can be used from religion, m yth and symbolism has been used and can only be recycled -- recycled like these c ollaged images from the trash-heap of society. The materials for these images was literally someone's garbage. My task was therefore, as usual, trying to turn \"lead into gold.\" Here, in this animated world, images are lovingly juxtaposed with their complements and opposites. Some images just want to \"live together.\" The f amiliar is combined with the mysterious, reflecting a unique surrealistic vi sion. Reflectaphors, or reflective metaphors, repeat themselves in each imag e or poster, as well as jump from image to image--i.e. they echo themes among the various p ieces as the series unfolds itself in self-similar fashion, like the ite rations of fractals. So, Anima Mundi bids you welcome and acts as our tour-guide or hostess.

Soul is the middle wo rld between gross materiality and the spiritual world. Matter, spirit, and ego fight over the soul. Yet soul is a primary experience, virt ually our only way of being. Each wants its unique fantasy to reign uppermost. So, the first task is to distinguish soul from spirit, so the body may unite with and be enlivened by both. This is a psychological approach to art and life--giving voice to soul, living life as art. It means the return of a subjective feminine eye on reality. It means the enlivening of our bodies and the world of nature with imagination. When we se e soul as the background of all phenomena, we becoming aware of the animating principle and develop a relationship with Her. All images arise either from body processes (instinct) or psychic for ms (spirit). Whether instinct-controlled or spirit-controlled, they are related to physiological processes. They appear psychologically as images, but work physiologically. They produce emotional or visceral aspects, but not in any causal way. The images don't produce reactions. The image is the entire psychophysical gestalt. The soul generates images unceasingly. The soul lives on images and metaphor, especially epistemological metaphors--how we know what we know. These images form the basis of our consciousness. All we can know comes through images, through our multi-sensory perceptions. So, this soul always stays close to the b ody, close to corporeality, to what \"matters.\" Let the images come into your body. Embrace the image. INTRODUCTION The ancient art of alchemy was the search for the God-head in matter. The alchemical task was to unify spirit and soul in the body. Psychic reality me ans to be in soul, esse in anima , as Jung put it. It means an enlarged experience of concrete reality, a dialogue with events, situations and circumstances. Psychic reality means to be in soul, through embodiment (soma) or enl ivenment (psyche)--perceiving images viscerally and mentally. Acknowledgement of t his force does not constitute Goddess worship--only recognition of the archetypal nature of reality, and the archetypal reality of nature, and our own nature. She is a way of reclaiming the divinity of body, matter, and world. This notion is part of the cultural return of the Feminine. Jungian analyst, James Hillman invites us into this world: Let us imagine the anima mundi neither above the world encircling it as a divine and remote emanation of spirit, a world of powers, archetypes, and principles transcendent to things, nor within the material world as it s unifying panpsychic life-principle.

Then anima mundi indicates the animated possibilitie s presented by each event as it is, its sensuous presentation as face bespeaki ng its interior image--in short, its availability to imagination, its presence as a psy chic reality. Not only animals and plants ensouled as in the Romantic vision, but soul is given with each thing; God-given things of nature and man-made thin gs of the street. This resurrection of the soul of the world means a raising of consciousne ss of created things, the world's psychic reality. Physical reality becomes ps ychic, and psyche becomes real--it \"matters.\" The difference between soul and external things no longer matters. Inner and outer world are both real and in fact One World. Image, metaphor and symbol bridge the abyss between matter and spirit. Im ages are the subtle net that unites symbols. They are integrated with feelin g, mind and imagination. We can see soul in all natural objects. We can notice our fantasies constantly conditioning our experience of reality. Knowledge of spirit does n't come from ideas, even revelations, but through a reflective process. I began this series of collages shortly after the death of both of my parents th ree days apart from one another. I am not a trained artist, but a clinical hypnotherapis t with a strong Jungian background in symbolism. Realizing I could use this for processing my own pain and grief, I began them as Art Therapy. I had originally made a few as examples for my students in a college class I taught, \" An Introduction to Depth Psychology. \" I found in my therapy practice a tendency for clients to present certain recurrent motifs, such as black holes, \"blacker than black,\" tunnels, images of chaot ic breakdown, etc. Prior, I had been writing a book called Dreamhealing with shaman/therapist Graywolf Fred Swinney. It was about Aesklepian dream healing, a technique developed around the metaphors of the then-new science of C haos Theory which is now known as Complexity. In this deepening process, the c lient becomes each element the imagination presents in turn. Immersed i n this imagery, I sought to create some visual images which might intimate this process. So, my posters are gestalts --where all elements are co-temporaneous, existing in time holigraphically--presented together even though they image a dynamic proce ss. Each of them constitutes a shamanic dream journey--a full immersion in the inner world. None of them are contrived beforehand--all were emergent experieen ces of just letting the image work themselves. No theme was determined in advance. The posters themselves dictate some of what must happen on them. In orde r for them to appear seamless, I had to hide or disguise the seams in various fashions. Yes , sometimes \"less is more,\" but most often more was needed to insure a s eamless quality. This was not a project were minimalism even could prevail."},{"pageNumber":1147,"pageContent":"Part of the burden and joy of working in this medium is using what one has, or can find, what is spontaneously available. Jungian psychology uses the notion of the bricoleur , the craftsman who works with that which is at hand. This includes th e psychologial situation as well as the materials. My grief work accentuated th e death- rebirth motif which is ubiquitous in therapy in any case. In their formative stages, the elements were not fixed on the canvas, and some times due to electrostatics, heat, and gravity \"things moved of their own accord.\" Alm ost invariably, this was an improvement over any intuitive or deliberate place ment I might have made. So, it was a process of flowing with the animating process, rath er than dictating the process. Later, they organized themselves into larger groups. There were obvious the matic connections for some of them, but others were not so obvious until there w ere hundreds of them. Their order has no relationship to the time of assembly. I have never re-sorted them, but for some reason the over-all story of the text for e ach leads seamlessly into the next, providing a narrative stream. The text for each piece suggested itself long after completion through a recognition process, or s ometimes immediately by synchronicity. They assembled themselves and with one anot her by a process I can only describe as \"synarchy.\" The awesome pandaemonium of imagery flowed forth spontaneously and my ego could not fight its way free. Rather, I had to surrender to the forces th at oftten crossed my subjective will. I was a slave to the process for some time, producing several pieces a week for long periods of time, and sometimes even doing more than one per day. The mystery images are a compelling source of transformation and healing, and it worked! The physician healed herself, or rather opened t o the inner healer and let time take care of the rest. [The poster originals are 24 x 36, and are assembled completely by hand. No computer enhancement has been used on any of them. All were done betw een 1994 and 1999.] THE NATURE OF ART What a picture means to the viewer is strongly dependent on past experienc e and knowledge. In this respect the visual image is not only a representation of “r eality” but a symbolic system. Language distinguishes between the functions of expre ssion, arousal and description, or symptom, sign, and symbol. It is important to distinguish th e expression of an emotion from its arousal, the symptom from the signal, especially in the “communication” of feeling. Communications may be symptomatic of emotive states or they may function as signals to release certain reactions. Human language and art has developed the descrip tive function to inform others of a particular state of affairs past, present, or future, obse rvable or distant, actual or conditional, visionary or imaginal. The visual image is supreme in its capacity for arousal, while its use for expressive purposes is problematic, an d unaided it"},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":"may require a matching statement for clarity or illumination to convey th e creator’s intent or experience. Art can fail to communicate its message because the view er lacks the experience or context or code to “get it,” as the artist saw or intended it. We are “programmed” to respond to certain visual signals; but this arousal fun ction of sights is not confined to definite images. Configurations of lines and color s have the potential to influence our emotions. What is usually described as communic ation is concerned with matter rather than with mood. Like verbal messages, imag es are vulnerable to the random interference engineers call “noise.” They use t he device of redundancy to overcome this hazard. In art, this redundancy of imagery and them es creates the “style” of the artists and the body of work reflects the issues and concerns to be communicated. The chance of a correct reading of the image is governed by three variables: th e code, the caption, and the context. Jointly the media of word and image increase the probab ility of a correct reconstruction or effect on the beholder. The mutual support of language and image facilitates emorizing or memorability. The use of two independent c hannels guarantees easier reconstruction in the mind’s eye. The image works in c onjunction with other factors to convey a clear-cut message that can be translated into word s. But the real value of imagery is its capacity to convey information that cannot be coded in any other way, frequently through the use of allusion or metaphors of known objects o r entities. The information extracted from an image (in particular, an archetypal image) c an be quite independent of the intentions of its maker. However faithful an image or reproduction, conveys visual information, thje process of selection always reveals the maker’ s interpretation of what he considers relevant. The “TELLTALE PICTURE ” requires that interpretation on the part of the image maker must always be matched by t he interpretation of the viewer. It is only when we are confronted with a total ly unfamiliar kind of structure that we are aware of the puzzle element in any repres entation. The easier it is to separate the code from the content, the more we can rely on the image to communicate a particular kind of information. A selective code that is understood to be a code enables the maker of the image to filter our certain kinds of infor mation and to encode only those feature that are of interest to the recipient. Such r enderings are transitions from a representation to diagrammatic mapping and the value of t he later process for the communication of information needs no emphasis. What is characteristic of the map is the addition of a key to the standarized code. It is only a small step from the abstraction of the map to a chart or diagram showing rel ations that are originally not visual but temporal or logical. A network of logical dependenci es (images held in the network of a piece), the diagram will always spread out before our eyes what a verbal description could only present in a string of statements. The image i s non-linear. Reading an image like the reception of any other message, is dependent on pri or knowledge of possibilities, we can only recognize what we know, consciously or a priori fr om the unconscious. Mysticism and alchemy have often employed imagery or visual symnbol s to appeal to seekers after revelations. To such seekers the symbol is felt to both convey and conceal more than the medium of rational discourse."},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"One of the reasons for this persistent feeling is the diagrammatic aspe ct of the symbol, its ability to convey relations more quickly and more effectively than a string of w ords. A symbol can become the focus of meditation. If familiarity breeds contem pt, unfamiliarity breeds awe. A strange symbol suggests a hidden mystery, and if its known to be anc ient, it is felt to embody some esoteric lore too sacred to be revealed to the mult itudes. Art is not produced merely for aesthetic effects. It is the arousal fu nction that determines the use of the medium. The cult image and its shrine mobilize the em otions that belong to the prototype. The power of such images is stronger than any rational consider ation. There are few who can escape the spell of a great cult image in its setting. The mn emonic power of the image means the power of symbolism to transform a metaphor into a memor able image through vivid portrayal. Allegorical images turn an abstract thought into a pictur e, a poetic evocation of feelings. There is a contrast between the prose and the poetry of image-making. The Rom antic concept of genius stressed the function of art as self-expression, but the expressive symptoms of emotions is to be distinguished in the theory of communic ation from the dimension of arousal or description. "},{"pageNumber":1150,"pageContent":"THE CREATIVE PROCESS Innovation in either the sciences or arts occurs only when a single min d perceives in disorder a deep new unity. Science is an attempt to control our surroundin gs by entering into them and understanding them from inside, and in a subjective realit y, so is art and mysticism. Both employ the processes of discovery, invention and creation. A con templative civilization values mystic immersion in nature and the immanent emptin ess within all nature (the ground state), the union with what already exists. Art is a personal, though often anonymous creation. And scientific discover y may be as well. Both science and art seek to find the design of nature in her detai l. It requires inductive thinking followed into the detail of nature, and our nature t o develop visionary insight. Theories are imaginative choices which often outstrip the given facts. I nduction images more than there is ground for and creates relations, which at bottom can never be verified. Every induction is a speculation and it guesses at a unity which facts we k now suggest. Every innovator has a particular way of looking att and arranging the facts, guided by a sense of aesthetic unity and beauty. Science shows us that nature has a uni ty, and this unity makes her laws seem beautiful in their simplicity. Our demand that nat ure be lawful is a demand for unity. We seek it instinctively. We become creative, whether as artistis, scientists or mystics, when we find a new unity in the variety of nature, a likeness between things (symbols or images) th at were not thought alike before, and this yields a sense of richness and of understandin g. The creative mind looks for unexpected likenesses, new analogies, and engaged the whole person ality. Art and science may likewise bridge the conflict between paradoxical an alogies, between poetic metaphors, and enrich our understanding of the world without c ompleting it. The images we create depend on our factual grasp of the relation between the sym bols in the image. Power is contained in conjoining minute particulars which deno te the change of scale between the metaphor and its application. This is the value of origi nality. We expect artists and scientist to be forward-looking, to fly in the face of w hat is estabished, to create new paradigms, not what is acceptable, but what will become accepted. Like art, science is preoccupied less with facts than wit h relations, less with numbers than with arrangement. New vision is the continuing search for structure. A theory is the creat ion of unity in what is diverse by the discovery of unexpected likenesses. In all of them innovat ion is pictured as an act of imagination, a seeing of what others have not yet seen. It is indeed, a creativ e observation of outer or inner worlds: \"The Tell-tale Art.\" "},{"pageNumber":1151,"pageContent":"PSYCHOGENESIS TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE INTRODUCTION PSYCHOGENESIS I: ALCHEMICAL REALITY psycho1.html -

She is one of my personal Heroes. Because some of my work parallels hers, her co mments are germaine to my own experience--only she can put it so much better than I . So, I take the liberty of selecting from some of her latest work, because it so sus cinct and pertinent. In A MYTHIC LIFE, (1996, Harper Collins: San Francisco;http://www.harpercollins.com) Jean describes her personal experiences. I'm using her words for now, as her first-person account can substitute pretty much for my own consciousness experime nts with myself and others: \"I began offering field trips in subjective realities. Using hypnosis and t rance, guided meditation, we entered inner realms of imagery and subjective realities. [This is the model of archaic shamanism, magic, mysticism, and modern psychotherapy.] After an initial experience of abstract images followed by images or feelings wit h more psychological content, my students would often experience a kind of visionary anthropology made up of fairy tale narratives, myths, archetypal figures, visits to \"other worlds\" and \"other dimensions,\" and similar science-fiction-l ike schema. It was fascinating to notice how many elements of the traditional hero's jour ney came up during these visits to inner worlds. This suggested that, despite cultural variations, the pattern of the hero's journey might be coded universally in the human min d and psyche. After some time in these inner worlds had elapsed, I would tell my studen ts, \"You are about to experience something that can be very powerful, a symbolic death and rebirth.\" Next, I would tell them that a symbol would now arise in their consc iousness that stood for their essential self. Once they sensed this, I would ask them to opbserve this symbol as it grew smaller and smaller, until at last it disappeared. \"Then,\" I w ould add, \"you may experience a kind of dying, and when this has been known fully, there will be a rebirth. Please know that you do not have to have this experience but th at it is now available to you if you do want to have it.\" [As an evocateur of spiritual experience] I wondered what we are to make of such religious and mystical experiences? Why, when the suggestion is given, are they so natural and ordinary and so readily evoked? In fact, it warned me how close to the surface is religious ecstasy and how easily it can be called forth and misused. [Session work showed me] that each possible human is not a member of some collective, but a profoundly individual and precious demonstration of life in it s infinite variety. This is certainly true on the physical plane and unimaginably more so when it comes to experiencing the internal realms. Indeed, the possible human can thin k in inward images and experience subjective realities as strikingly as she can kn ow objective ones. She listens to inward music as complex as any symphony, in fact often richer, for instruments and sounds are added that are unknown...She uses these images to entertain herself as well as to provide the materials of creativit y and invention. She is already an adventurer into a vast reservoir of virtual real ities and"},{"pageNumber":1156,"pageContent":"needs no machine to assist her. She knows that self-creating works of art are al ways budding out of the fields of her mind, and she can capture and rework them as she wishes. Consciousness for her is a vast landscape, a continuous landscape, and she travels i ts length and breadth at will. She enters a state of meditation here, a region of deep trance there, finding shortcuts into the realms of fantasy and imagination , spelunking her way into the caves of creativity. She continues to discover the many cu ltures of her psyche and has matriculated in the Innerversity, studying all manner of knowledge and wisdom that these cultures within provide. She has many friends and allies in the inward and imaginal worlds, the most im portant of whom may be the beloved of the soul, the spiritual friend who is her archet ypal partner and the companion of her depth reality. And, whenever she feels ready, sh e journeys to the source places of her soul, where she partakes of the everlast ing waters of life and the spirit. She lives daily life as spiritual exercise, and her radian ce affects all who meet her, for she is deeply empathic, knowing herself part of a seamless kinship with all living things. Being more, and using more of herself, s he feels and cares more deeply about the decay and degradation in the social and moral order. In spite of evidence to the contrary, she recognizes others as God-in-hiding, and i n whatever way she can, she calls them back to their own possible humanity. Thi s possible human is not mere fantasy. I have found that most people, given opportunity and training, can learn to think, feel , and know in new ways, to become more creative and more imaginative, and to aspire within realistic limits to a much larger awareness, one that is superbly e quipped to deal with the complex challenges of modern life. True, we have never achieved the fully functioninbg person described above, but we are getting closer. Many people have allowed me to tap into the streams of realities that exist within them, and what I see in these streams are other realms. I must conclude that our l ocal existence is nested in the domain that I call the \"We Are.\" This is the abode of symbols, guiding archetypes, and myths. Enduring in an eternal world outside ti me and space, and thoroughly transhistorical, the We Are realm functions as the con tact point for sacred time and space, the container for that which never was but is always happening. Since its source is complex, its coding is intense. By this I mean that the archetypal image bears within itself multipl e meanings, modds, potentials, dimensions. Thus the human psyche is inherently polythei stic, which is why sacred psychology has to honor the gods and goddesses in everyone. To me, what we call \"gods\" are actually encoding of particular energy patterns from the We Are r ealm seen with certain qualities and moods to help us relate to them more personal ly. That is today, this realm is the place where the self joins its larger possibilities s--when perceived as gods and goddesses. In Sanskrit, these being are called yidams, personified river to the ocean of being. The gods are forces that have crystallized in the consciousness of human cu ltures and are revered as personalized emanations of a greater and unnameable power coming"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"from both within and beyond the psyche. Sometimes they assume a humanized, semihistorical form [a Master of consciousness exploration]. We may feel a particularly loving resonance with such beings who have been elevated to godhood, identifying with both their numinous power and their storied humanity. Virtually every culture has tapped into this archetypal realm to acquire th e energies of the stories that illumine rites of renewal and social transformation. F or example, since the We Are realm is the residence of creation myths and the energies of ori gins, many cultures have their priestesses, priests, shamans, and rulers enact a c entral creation myth at the time of the new year. They play the parts of the gods who conquer the principles of chaos, restoring order and recreating the world. In this way, they bri ng the Great Time of creation and deeper reaches of the psyche back into the local wor ld of the This Is Me. In so doing, nature is restored, and psyches of both community and individual are granted the healing energies of new life. Today, what we call the gods come down to us as the imaginative products of earlier historical ages--Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Asian, Native American. They are, i n fact, numinous borderline personalities. Embedded in earlier myths and ways of bein g, they serve as vehicles through which we may come to understand our strength s as well as our shadows. They grant us perspective into the ways in which certain behavior al patterns dominate our lives. Part of the emergence of an archetypal spiritual ity and mythology is the ongoing story of our allowing the gods their growtth as we in tur n deepen our humanity. Only then can we see the divine beings as partners in cr eation. The divine-human partnership hhas thus become the leading archetypal image f or our time. The partnership is one that mystics and poets have long known to be true, for myths and archetypes communicate from the poetic level of mind and thought s, allowing nature to speak to the imagining soul rather than just presenting u s with scientific laws and probabilities. The poetic mind is of a higher order of cohere nce, because it has color, aesthetic form, rhythmic relation; it belongs to a finer f requency of the mind-brain continuum. Indeed, evidence exists that in certain stat es of consciousness, the mind-brain system appears to move into a larger wave res onance, a frequency that may itself be nested in a continuum of m ind beyond the field of the experiencing body. In this state, mystics and highly creative people come back e nriched and enlivened to do or think remarkable things. When we meet myths and archety pes in this state, we can speak directly to the inner imaginal realm in which m ind, nature, and spirit converge, and our highest potentials become available to us. I once studied fifty-five of the most creative thinkers, scientists , and artists alive in America. These people had sustained a high level of creativity over many years . I talked to them at length, ran tests, and observed them when they were boh \"on\" and \"off\" their creative bent. What I found is that most had trained themselves to delve consciously int o depth levels of reality in which the forms and creations of their imaginative life and w orks were conceived. They drew their insights not only from their own capacious min ds but also from the great creative archetypal realm wherein are \"stored\" the princi ples that source new ideas and forms."},{"pageNumber":1158,"pageContent":"I also discovered that a majority of them felt that they were partnered by an arc hetype, a beloved of the soul, a spiritual partner who amplifies the deeper aspects of the se lf. This relationship disengages us for a while from the demands and demeanings of our local, ego-focused personalities and allows us to view our personal concerns f rom a universal perspective. Beyond and within the other two realms lies the realm I call the \"I Am.\" T his is the realm of Being itself, pure potency, love, the very stuff of reality. This is the realm many know as God. This does not mean \"the gods,\" they live in the We Are; rather, i t means God as the ground and unified Essence of being. About this realm nothing and everything can be said. The I Am is the supreme frac tal wave from which everything branches, out of which everything comes forth . We bear its signature in the wave forms of our cells, the curvings of our histories . God is always calling to the human heart. We are signalled all the time by the pulsings of or iginal grace. The seed within, which held and nurtured the divine spark, is now fully grow n, and we find ourselves transplanted into the vast gardens of universal life. CHAOSOPHY 2000 Today we are in a period of cultural and personal expansion. We are experiencing not just t he revival of ancient images, but also the harvest of all the world's cultures, be lief systems, ways of knowing, seeing, doing, being. Gradually we discover that these stories are our own st ories, that they bear the amplified rhythms of our own lives, deepending and enhancin g us, filling us with a sense of the fractal resonance of the mythic life within our own. Working with myth, we assume the passion and the pathos of Isis as she seeks t o recover the remains of her husband Osiris; with Parsifal, we take on the quest for the Grail; we labor with Hercules and travel with Odysseus into the archetypal idlands of inner and out er worlds. It requires that we undertake the extraordinary task of dying to our current, local sel ves and of being reborn to our eternal selves. A psychology with a mythic or sacred base demands that we have the courage both to rel ease the limitation brought about by old wounds and toxic bitterness and to gain access t o theundiminished self with its vast inner storehouse of capacities. We can then use these capacities to prepare ourselves for the greater agenda--becoming an instrument through which the source may play its great music. Then, like the hero or heroine of myth, we may, regardless of our circumstanc es, become an inspiration for helping culture and consciousness move toward its next lev el of possibility. At this we startle, we shake. The scope of this dream demands that we live out of our tr ue Essence, which is always too large for our local contracted consciousness to cont ain. It requires many mythic adventures of the soul to reloom body and mind. Myths have such power because they are full of archetypes. Archetypes ar e many things-- primal forms, codings of the deep unconscious, constellations of psychic energy , patterns of"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"relationship. Our ancestors saw them in the heavens, as Mother Earth, Fathe r Sky, Sister Wind. They were the great relatives from whom we derived, and they not only gav e us our existence, they continue to personify as mythic characters and their stor ies, such as that of the holy child. As major organs of the psyche, archetypes give us our essential connection s, and without them we lose the gossamer bridge that joins spirit with nature, mind and body, and self with the metabody of the universe. Archetypes are organs of Essence, the cosmic bluepri nts of how it all works. Because they contain so much, archetypes frustrate analysis and perhaps can onl y be known by direct experience. Thus, in the journey of transformation, we participat e in these symbolic dramas and actively engage in archetypal existence. We form a powerful sense of ide ntity with the archetypal character, and this mythic being becomes an aspect of ourselve s writ large. Symbolic happenings appear with undisguised relevance, not only for our own lives and problems, but also for the remaking of society. Joseph Campbell told Jean Houston that she is supposed to help find the cor respondences between myth and everything else--history and science and psychology and what's trying to happen in the world--the pathways from the past and the pathways to the f uture. Myth sheds its radiant light on the multiplicity of human learning as well as t he mysteries of the human heart. They are the \" mything links. \" Campbell summarized the process in his classic accounts of the Hero' s journey with its characteristic tasks, such as \" the call to adventure .\" Some of us feel the call every minute. The next stage in Campbell's cycle of the hero's journey is the refusal of the call, putting the summons off or delaying it because it comes at an inconvenient time or becau se one doesn't feel worthy. The hero risks crossing the threshold of adventure, to enter a realm of amplifi ed power. In the traditional journeys, this stage involves leaving the world of ordinary realit y and entering the inner, visionary realms, confronting the guardian of the threshold. The real threshold guardian is in ourselves, the part of us who will not release our hold on cons ciousness enough to let the ego dissolve our boundaries and ooze into that deeper realm, the via positiva. Once across, the hero is swallowed by the unknown, be it a whale, a wolf, a sarcophagus, or a cave. It takes many guises and can take the form of a depression or ingression, even a str ong need to get away from it all. The road of trials in the hero's journey is a time of i ncredible tests, ordeals, and extraordinary adventures. After securing the boon, there is magic flight back across the threshold wit h the boon intact...integrating the results of the journey. Once you answer the call t o a larger life, there is no turning back. We learn to think mythically. Life is allied with myth in order that we may advance along an evolutionary path carrying us nearer to the spiritual source t hat lures us into greater becoming. It grants us access to the DNA of the human psyche, the source patterns origi nating in the ground of our being. It gives us the key to our personal and historical existence.

We humans are the storied, mythic links between the great patterns of existe nce and the local experiences that assure their continuity in the world of time and histo ry. In my current work, I often use variations of this pattern as the loom on which to weave journeys of transformation drawn from the world's great myths and stories. I find that regardless of th e culture, people will go further and faster in developing human capacities if their training i s tied to a story, especially a myth. For myth transcends and thus tansforms our usual blocks and condititionings, carrying us into a realm in which these need not constra in us. And if the myth is a familiar one, present in the fabric of the culture, it works even better. How do we achieve our own renaissance of mind and spirit? By connecting with a poten t sense of our own Essence. Essence is not a place or a time, an insight or even a stat e of mind. It is the deepest part of our nature, an actual presence that is innare and inborn. W hen it wears a personal face, it is called an angel or a daimon, or genius. Still others think of it, in its incorporeal form, as the soul. It does not develop with education or maturity. It is beyond symbols, and is, therefore, neither archetype nor angel, neither w ise old man or woman, nor divine child. These symbols point the way to Essence, the incorr uptible \"diamond body.\" Essence is so real, so substantial, that it exceeds all symbols, images, and language in deep and profound living embodied experience. When we first climb out of the bottom of the well, we experience Essenc e as a strange and beautiful country of the soul. It brings a clarity, a precision that seldom com es from reasoning, intuition, or insight. The deepest values, purposes, and patterns for life, the richest potential codin g for existence, the source level of creative patterns, innovative actions, and ideas become known to us from the perspective of Essence through its rediscovery of life's higher pur pose through the images.

In Hindu Tantra, pra ctice is graded into three types, corresponding to three classes of devotees: the ani mal, i.e., those in whom the guna, or quality, of tamas (darkness) predominates; the hero ic, those in whom the guna of rajas (activity) predominates; and the divine, those in w hom sattva (goodness) predominates (see Hindu philosophy). The practice of the heroic devot ee entails actual use of the five elements, called the five m's: fish (matsya), meat (mamsa), w ine (madya), aphrodisiac cereals (mudra), and sexual intercourse (maithuna). The animal devot ee, not yet ready for the heroic practice, performs the rituals with material symbols; for the divine devotee the rituals are purely internal and symbolic. The object of the rituals, a ttainable only by the divine devotee, is to awaken kundalini energy, which is identified with S hakti, and merge with the Godhead. In Buddhist Tantra, or Vajrayana, in contrast to the H indu, the female principle of \"wisdom (prajna) is seen as static, whereas the male, or \"m eans (upaya), is active. In Buddhism, rituals that appear to break basic moral precepts h ave for the most part been dropped, but the complex meditation practices have been retained . The Kama Sutra , the classical Indian treatise on the Art of Love, describes Sixty-four Arts to be practiced along with the Kama Sutra. The number sixty-four reminds of the hexagrams of the I Ching.

TANTRIC LUNAR RESONANCE MEDITATION Its Links with Tarot and the Western Tradition by Richard and Iona Miller (aka Philo Stone, 1981; revised and updated, 2002) This article was originally prepared for Miller and Miller's Holistic Qabala , but ran in Volume I (Autumn 1985) of Tom Lyttle's (Ed.) Psychedelic Monographs and Essays . It discloses a relationship between ancient Vedic meditation prac tices and mathematical anomolies in the Moon's orbit only discovered by NASA in the l ast century. "},{"pageNumber":1167,"pageContent":"During Vedic and pre-Vedic periods, (according to sources such as Satapatha Brahmana and Taittireva Sanhita ), there were certain times of each month when the priests would meditate on specific symbols. The belief was that, if one meditated in syn chronization with these phases, it could be compared to riding on a swing. A kick at the right p oint could put more energy into the swing than at any other point in the cycle. The ancient be lief was that meditation on certain symbols at specific times related to phases of the m oon would add ' soma ' to the body more than at other times of the month. Though the nature of soma has been hotly debated, most agree it produced optimal spiritual growth. Farmers and gardeners have for centuries known the profound differenc es in weather, plant growth, and seed-timing associated with lunar phases. Newer researc h shows the moon's effect on the electromagnetic fields of the earth, and their sub sequent biological influence. Specific examples can be found in the lunar sex cycle of the f emale, and the insomnia and emotional instability characteristic of the Full Moon phase. Less well-known is that the moon may be used as a means of spiritual r egeneration and accelerating the growth of the \"diamond body,\" or spiritual vehicle. There is a higher spiritual aspect to the Moon Goddess than that represented as Yesod in th e Tree of Life, or psychologically as the \"personal\" anima, (one's projected feminine ideal). A nima Mundi, or the Divine Inspiratrix, is represented on the Tree of Life and in Tar ot by Trump II, the High Priestess , the crescent Moon. This Goddess not only confers 'immortality,' but also wisdom and inspiration. She is our medium, mediator or intercessor with the divine. Soma and the Moon Myth states that inspiration of the moon comes from the dark phases and fr om the soma drink which is brewed from the moon tree. The biological basis of th is intoxicating recipe has been debated, and proposed answers range from magick mushrooms to long -extinct herbs. Nevertheless, this inspiration is described as the antithes is of rational thought, embodied in dark obscure movements, thoughts and impulses of darkness . It manifests as an intoxicant, producing an enthusiasm which may even lead to madness. Soma was considered a universal life power dispensed in great abundance d uring the waning moon. It could be absorbed directly in meditative states without havin g to ingest any plant at all. Certain plants were held to be particularly efficient in collecting and storing soma, this mysterious psychic energy. Those eaten with the power to change consciousness were held sacred as embodiments of deities. Psychologically, the ritual for absorbing soma is designed for relating oneself properly to the feminine principle -- what has become popularly known as the Godde ss. Then one gains access to the eternal, immovable aspect of psyche, the reality of Self, which transcends the duality of gender descriptions. When drinking in soma (entheogen), the in itiate becomes filled with the god (entheos). The inner voice of the daemon speaks, unce nsored, and takes control for a time. In Magick this is called \"assuming the god-form,\" an epipha ny -- a miracle marriage, the merging of subject and object, figure and ground, p rofane and sacred."},{"pageNumber":1168,"pageContent":"Through communion in the meditative process, an individual becomes ac quainted with his/her own limits, depths and ultimate reality. The highest incar nation of the female form of the Holy Spirit confers the deepest revelation. The goddess is a pow erful wisdom-figure and psychological force having the power to mold destiny. As well as High Pr iestess, she is Shekinah in Judaism, Sekina in Islam, Shakti in Hinduism, Sophia in Gn osticism, Virgin Mary in Christianity, Artemis in mythology. These are common forms for women' s experience of the higher Self. There is a familiar passage from the Hermetic texts, called The Veil. It emphatically states that the veil signifies the Veil of the Universe or Robe of Isis. Magician A leister Crowley said this Veiled Isis \"is clothed only in the luminous veil of light . It is important for the high initiation to regard Light not as the perfect manifestation of Eternal S pirit, but rather as the veil which hides that Spirit.\" These passages might be read as an exhortation to penetrate beyond the brightl y lit region of Tiphareth, the heart center and solar consciousness -- passed the re gion of the stars (The Universe), moon (Yesod) and sun (Tiphareth) of the astral world. The highe r arc of Lunar consciousness is a more diffuse awareness, a dark-adapted Third Eye, an ability to penetrate the Void by discerning the dimly lit regions or 'Dark Matter and Energy' of the deepest layers of the primordial unconscious to the Ground State of Bei ng. True initiation implies breaking through the Veil of the Virgin, first into self-realization then into God-realization. The veil is part of our spiritual nature; it e pitomizes the blocks to our enlightenment as embodied in our personalities and our souls' at tachment to our minds, and to Universal Mind. To raise it means to dis-identify and deconst ruct ourselves until we find our fundamental unification with divinity. It mean s to transcend the limits of individuality and become consciously immortal (or, conscious of our inheren t immortal nature). The soul is released from the constraints of time, space and ego-or ientation. Turning psychological energy inward, through meditation, is a characteristi cally feminine process. This introversion and brooding produces a \"psychic child\" whi ch corresponds to Jung's concept of individuation. He wrote about this 'divine child' at len gth in The Secret of the Golden Flower in Taoist terms, but it also appears in Western metaphysics as the Diamond Body. Individuation's greatest value is attached to an activity of the cre ative imagination known as \"soul-making.\" Careful aesthetic elaboration of an even t is its significance. There is NO separation, in soul-making, between an event and i ts meaning. A sense of the sacred is, thereby, returned to daily activity and, in fact, seamle ssly welded to it. This inner marriage of intentionality and inwardness, of masculinity and f eminine components gives birth to the inner child and release from the power o f death. In a sense, in meditation one learns to \"die daily.\" Death becomes a familiar guest, and brings Grace in its wake. Ego-death is induced by withdrawing the external focus of t he senses and focusing attention at the Eye Center. Successful accomplishment of th is process, this child, is the Self in embryonic form, ever renascent, the fruit of psychic development. The \"Inner Moon\" Chakra"},{"pageNumber":1169,"pageContent":"Soma is also associated in yogic practice with the \"inner moon\" chakra, analogous to t he pituitary and pineal glands. This \"inner moon\" is said to shower subtle s ecretions, or soma drops, which nourish the psychophysical organism. These glands directly i nfluence physiological processes. The pituitary regulates, among other functions, se x hormones, metabolism, and growth and development of the individual. The pineal develops from specialized tissues and is proximate to cer ebrospinal fluid channels, and crucial emotional and sensory brain centers. It is separated from the hypothalamus and visual and auditory relay stations only by a resonant cavity -- one of the brain's fluid-filled ambrosial 'lakes' or ventricles. The pineal ha ngs from the roof of the ventricle. Certain practices, such as intense fine-tuning of attenti on and awareness, can amplify or prolong its chemical effects, making us see, hear, feel and thin k differently. The pineal produces the sleep drug melatonin and is alleged to produce en dogenous or natural DMT, a psychedelic chemical, by psychiatrist Rick Strassman (2001, DMT: the Spirit Molecule ). A main characteristic of this chemical, the biological basis of spirit ual experience, is the production of Light. According to Strassman, the psyched elic pineal \" is unique in its solitary status within the brain. All other brain sites are paired, meaning that they have left and right counterparts... As the only unpaired organ deep within the brain, the pineal gland remained an anatomical curiosity for nearly two thousand years .\" DMT is physically immobilizing and produces a flood of unexpected and overw helming visual and emotional imagery. Pineal DMT release may also mediate sexual ecstas y, resulting from strenuous exertion, hyperventilation, and intense emoti ons. This may be the driver behind the psychedelic nature of the Tantric sexual experienc e. High levels of natural DMT production are also implicated during heightened awareness d uring stress and in the clear light of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs). \" All spiritual disciplines describe quite psychedelic accounts of the tr ansformative experiences, whose attainment motivate their practice. Blinding white light, encounters with demonic and angelic entities, ecstatic emotions, timelessness, heave nly sounds, feelings of having died and been reborn, contacting a powerful and loving presence underlying all of reality -- these experiences cut across all denominations. They also are ch aracteristic of a fully psychedelic DMT experience ,\" (Strassman, 2001). And meditation can evoke the pineal DMT response. The deeper the meditation, the slower and stronger the brainwaves become, like a standing wave in a river. These waves create a unique note, or sound , a resonance effect. \" The pineal begins to \"vibrate\" at frequencies that weaken its multiple barriers to DMT formation ...the end result is a psychedelic surge of the pine al spirit molecule, resulting in the subjective states of mystical consciousness .\" The Moon, Tantra and Hyperdimensional Numbers More than 20 years ago, Richard Wurtman of M.I.T. stated that stress activates the pin eal gland. This then exerts an inhibitory influence on the body's stress me chanism (the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal axis). In view of the pineal's sedative ef fect on the Central Nervous System (CNS), \"the ancient mystics may have had something when th ey attributed effects of meditation to the pineal gland.

Ravi Kumar; Basel, Paris and New Delhi , 1971) shows a leaf from a seventeenth century Kashmiri tantric manuscript: \" A female figure illustrating (the 9 + 9) position of Amritakala [the times of immortality, literally], which have to be energized on respective dates of th e white and dark halves of the month for successful tantric asanas. The eighteen (9 + 9) focal centers in the female body mentioned in the Ratirahasva can be excited by t he adept when harmonized with the exact location of the chandrakala on the respective day s of the white as well as the dark halves of the month .\" This quote shows the relationship between the pre-Vedic and Indo-I ranian immortality teachings and phases of the moon. The planetary Moon and the \"inner moon\" are li nked by the doctrine of signatures or sames; they share a common essence, exer t a common influence. The lunar month is specifically divided into 9 special days in both the waxing and waning halves, a cycle composed of 18 days in all. There is a striking correspond ence (first noticed by Dr. Charles Muses) between the two-fold cycle of lun ar phases each month and the hypernumber w, a lunar elliptic orbit function developed by N ASA for the space program. This hypernumber w and its phases of the elliptical orbits provide th e only available mathematical paradigm corresponding to the anomolies distinct to the waxi ng and waning lunar fortnights. This striking relationship indicates that, during p re-Vedic periods, a system of highly developed sets of mathematical descriptions existed f or the movement of the moon about the earth, or at least their psychic equivalent. Hyperdimensional mathematics is a system or field developed to enco mpass a body of complex universes. An example is the hyperdimensional number \"i\" w hich is the square root of -1. The square root of -1 has several solutions, some of which are applicable t o the physical world, some which are not. These non-physical solutions relate t o other universes. These worlds are created primarily to solve problems not solvable in the ph ysical world. The hypernumber w has the remarkable property that, when multiplied successively by itself, all the resulting numbers lie on a certain ellipse. The numb ers resulting from multiplying the square root of w successively by itself also lie on the very sa me ellipse; exactly twelve distinct points are generated by these processes. There are three principle irregularities in the lunar orbit that h ave been known since Ptolemy of Alexandria. They were rediscovered by the famous 16th century astrono mer, Tycho Brahe, a student of Kepler. These irregularities together furnish a set of eight places in the lunar orbit where these reflecting configurations of force are maximum. These places map on the eight points furnished by the integer powers of the hypernumb er w. W was conceived by 20th century mathematicians to describe these very irreg ularities of the lunar orbit. This seems to indicate that the pre-Vedic periods had mathematics o r intuitive observations which counter some of our most advanced concepts in mathematics today. It is also known that the various phases of the moon affect a number of biological cycles. Therefor e, it is now possible to adapt these equations to the meditative process of the ( 9 + 9) phases of the"},{"pageNumber":1171,"pageContent":"moon. This Tantric tradition for maximal absorption of soma, using these point s in the lunar cycle, leads to the immortality of the soul. There are fundamental points which are important in the lunar tradit ion. First quarter to the Full Moon is generally related to unstable mental states. The first quarter and the Full Moon are when most magical rituals are practiced, as energy is building and cul minating. Only very rarely does one use a waning moon, preferring a waxing moon for ceremony. A waning moon generally symbolizes soma going into the body. Waxing indicates energy coming out of the body, through some form of expression. Waning periods, then, are generally when one meditates and absorbs energy. Waxing periods use that energy as an expression, in Magick for invoking a given archetype, or god-form, such as the higher s elf. Spiritual regeneration also occurs during certain phases of the moon. Even t oday, the ascending and descending nodes of the lunar orbit are termed the Dragon 's Head and the Dragon's Tail. This dragon is a time-honored symbol for the goddess, the Great Mo ther. The time intervals taken by the moon in returning to its given node is terme d the Dragonic month even in modern astronomy. The ancient Indo-Iranian lunar tradition s ascribe the \"holiest power\" of the month to the dark of the moon. In terms of this trad ition, the soma (energy for spiritual regeneration) most fully saturates the earth dur ing the waning moon, when the \"invisible\" (or higher) light is brightest. The new moon is t he period when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction. This symbolizes the alchemical Coniunct io, or Divine Marriage. At its dark phase, the moon is conjoined with the sun itself, even though w e see only a dark moonless night. This is possible because the relative distances of sun and moon make the size of their visible disks the same size; the light of the sun washe s out the reflected moonlight. At this point the moon psychophysically effects our central ner vous system the most. In both traditions, the pre-Vedic and Indo-Iranian, the dark of the moon is associated with maximum life elixer flow. The waning or putrifying, fert ilizing moon, culminated in the dark of the moon was associated with the male powers. The waxing or gestating form of moon was associated with female powers. In this model, wanin g moon is masculine; while waxing is feminine -- though in other systems the ac tive is masculine while the passive phase is considered feminine. Through this meditation and absorption of soma, the mystical or Diamond Body (created by harmonization of male and female principles), may be built up for consci ousness to inhabit as a spiritual vehicle. The soul becomes refined and finds uni ty with Spirit. This occurs via the image. In Tantra, this imagery was associated with the female partn er, as representative of various forms of the goddess, Shakti. Through corresponden ces with Tarot and the paths of the Tree of Life, we can incorporate western imagery in to this meditation. The pre-Vedic technique was designed as a system for achieving immortal ity. This exercise is also known as Circulation of the Light. The meditation exercise is d esigned with this circulation, or exchange between the masculine and feminine poles, as th e central focus. Indo-Iranian immortality teachings state that growth of the higher body du ring life allows full consciousness to remain even after phsycial death. They divided the l unar month into"},{"pageNumber":1172,"pageContent":"nine special days in both waxing and waning halves. These divisions are ide ntical to the equation and solutions of the hypernumber \"w\": 9 + 9 going to 18. As with everything, there are certain guidelines which must be practi ced in order to obtain the maximum benefit. These rules approximate amplification of hypern umber w solutions or lunar phase points. RULE 1: The first day after the full moon is session one. The day after the f ull moon begins the cycle of this meditation exercise. RULE 2: The Outline Session 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Waning 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 13 Waxing 15 17 18 20 22 23 24 26 28 RULE 3: Face west during waning meditation periods. RULE 4: Face east during waxing meditation periods. RULE 5: If a session is skipped, do not omit sessions 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9 each fortnight. Th is holds for both the waning and waxing periods. RULE 6: If for some reason the cycle is interrupted for some time, resum e Session One of each fortnight. RULE 7: Full Moons which occur between midnight and dawn are consider ed to occur one day earlier than the calendar date. (Example: if the full moon ocurs this mor ning at 3:00 a.m., then start Session 1 today). RULE 8: It is best to meditate at Sunrise. RULE 9: There is a special resonant peak which occurs after the 13th lunar c ycle and six sessions (one year and three months after onset). If one does these meditations correctly, as in the Indo-Iranian periods , one may theoretically achieve immortality with this soma that is pouring into the b ody. This is the formula for immortality of the soul, according to the pre-Vedic traditions. The table listing the sessions and the days is more or less self-explanator y. You do not do this meditation every day, but only on the days indicated. Returning the attribution of a deity via imagery is paramount to attaining full benefit from the sessions as ou tlined. To incorporate this meditation practice into the tradition of QBL, we h ave corresponded the Session with appropriate paths of the Tarot. This may be extended by employi ng the corresponding colors, incense, herbs, etc. The key imagery for the nine sessions of the waning fortnight are as follows: 1. Session One, XXI, THE UNIVERSE The first session rekindles the flame of inspiration. One chooses volun tary rededication to the work of the soul, the Great Work. Rededication is returning attention to archetypal"},{"pageNumber":1173,"pageContent":"processes, attention is equivalent to worship. This reorientation is attai ned through perseverance in the use of the creative imagination. It produces synchron ization of the body, mind and emotions. 2. Session Two, XX JUDGMENT/AEON This session is designed to develop access to the contents of the unconscious. This resurrection or remembering of preconscious information is involved wi th one's modes of perception. An access state involves a broadened field of perception, wh ere one sees through the metaphorical presentation to the archetypal core of situations. 3. Session Three, XVIII, THE MOON This session provdides the power to remold or reprogram the emotions and beliefs in the subconscious mind. The cerebellum has the power to initiate profound changes in the body, the organ-I-zation. It can create a stabilized center or homeostasis. Thi s is an important time to record dreams. 4. Session Four, XIII, DEATH One prepares for freedom , for the time when the physical body is no longer an appropriate vehicle, by building the diamond body. Entry into the subtle body is more eas ily achieved at this time each month. Temporary separations between super-physical and the physical body are possible by the Magickal exercise known as \"rising on the planes.\" Death may be viewed as a profound change in one's old conception of personality. The respons ibility is to re-vision oneself able to move consciousness into the mystical body. Kali i s worshipped in the cremation grounds symbolizing burning away of the dross which inhibi ts spiritual progress. 5. Session Five, XIX, THE SUN This session is one of uncompromising self-analysis and inner honesty . Through examining your innermost heart, you may align your physical, mental and spiritual goals. Enlightenment or solar consciousness consists of perpetual consciou s observation of the imaginal life: behavior fantasies, dreams, thoughts, emotions, etc. This sessi on, like the first, is linked with the two following ones, in an operation group of thr ee. 6. Session Six, XV, THE DEVIL The power that flows now enables us to bridge intellect and profound in tuitive insight. From this marriage, genius is born. This path connects the logic of Hod wi th the intuition of Tiphareth. It may be viewed as a test of one's personal integrity . 7. Session Seven, XVII, THE STAR This third session of the group of three confers the power of clairvoyance, c learness of vision . Insight is possible through cultivation of the subtle senses. Creative imagination (consciousness cooperating with subconscius) leads, via Netzach, or Aphrod ite, to growth and artistic inspiration. 8. Session Eight, XIV, ART/TEMPERANCE This session pre-figures the victorious and fully-conscious trance nding of physical death. The keywords are immortality and liberation . This is the climax session of the waning phase. Climax, in Greek, means \"ladder.\" It is precisely use of sexual climaxes as a l adder for"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"mystical attainment that is fundamental to the practice of Tantra or sex magi ck. There is value in the ascending and descending of the soul upon this ladder; building up and holding off are inherent in this sense of the word. A \"climax\" does not prioritize the orgasm, per se. As Crowley said, \"Be strong; then canst thou bear more joy.\" This day is super ior for doing Middle Pillar Exercise, or invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. These for ms of building the diamond body create a liberating paradigm for immortality. Soma is d istilled into the alchemical elixer vitae via sex magick, regenerate love. The return of these sex magick proceedures to the QBL tradition has been responsible for t he resurgence of vitality in the western tradition. 9. Session Nine, IX, THE HERMIT Mercury, as Logos and Phallus, preserves both the Light and Life. As \"messenger of the gods,\" Mercury fosters multiple perspectives. The union of opposites of Session 8 necessitates tolerance. Remember the virtues of silence and sec recy. Persevere in the meditations without lust of result. You may wish to observe a day of ritual silen ce. This session consolidates the development gained so far. This concludes the sessions of the waning, or male fortnight. During the s essions of the waxing, or feminine fortnight, the priestess becomes the living repres entative of the lunar goddess. 1. Session One, XVI, THE TOWER The waxing moon has to do with physical expression, dynamic engagement. It produce s an influx of energy which yields increases in health, vitality and effecti veness. Ares marshalls in discipline in the physical body. Physical discipline, such as yoga or marti al arts, improve breathing, tone, vitality, disposition, etc. Dynamic engagement with life cou ld be corresponded with Horus. The keywords for this session are engaging light , or tuning in . Since Pe , the Hebrew letter for this path, means \"mouth,\" it is a good time to formul ate and declare one's oath. Speaking ability is enhanced at this time. 2. Session Two, IX, THE HERMIT This is a period to link the conscious functions with the unconsciou s (i.e. Tai Chi). In the eastern traditions, monks were trained in martial arts to connect body movem ent with meditative awareness and control. Every motion is motivated by archetypal patt erns, producing a state of connection to power . This type of total involvement develops patience and lends an increased ability to meditate. 3. Session Three: XVIII, THE MOON In this session the physiological benefits of meditation are incorporate d into the body. Unconscious processes have the power to effect change in such functio ns as the heart, digestion, kidneys, ductless glands, and the brain. Circulation of the Light has a psychological healing effect which influences the cerebellum via sym bolism. The keyword is doing better than I know . 4. Session Four: XIII, DEATH This session represents the perpetual movement of creation, destru ction and renewal. It is the time for shedding unwanted or hindering desires, patterns, situ ations, or habits as old"},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"skin is shed. For those who \"die daily\" every morning is a resurrection, aw akening soul to new possibilities. The beginnings of victory lie in proper revaluation . 5. Session Five: XX, JUDGMENT/AEON To facilitate transmutation, this session is aimed at outer and inner cleansing and purgation . Medicines, herbs, and baths are most effective now. Review your journal and conscientiously examine your thought processes and motivations. Once the accu mulation of body wastes are metabolized, there is a surplus of energy for living out spi ritual principles. 6. Session Six: XVII, THE STAR The love power now enters and transfuses the body until it begins to lit erally shine. The image of a beautiful naked woman is the shining vision which presages indi viduation. Grace pervades all event formation. The refining power of love is the key to e ternal youth. Refinement, or clarification is linked with discernment. 7. Session Seven: X, WHEEL OF FORTUNE Health, luck and power are absorbed during this period. Beneficent Ze us bestows his gifts, enabling you to complete difficult tasks or overcome obstacles. Be alert for opportunities. The key word is extra power . 8. Session Eight: XIV, ART/TEMPERANCE This is the key session of the waxing phases and is used to help the body and outer life with \"power for accomplishing.\" This is not the power to fulfill desires , but to fulfill one's True Will. This is the power that confers harmony with one's environment. It is truly a blessing. Grace descends, via the activated Middle Pillar, through the imagery of the Holy Guardian Angel. Participate freely in an internal dialogue. In this Knowledge and Con versation is equilibrium that is the consummation of the Royal Marriage of the Sun and Moon. This fusion generates the internal union of subject and object; consciou sness and being merged into bliss. In alchemy, this state is known as the Unus Mundus , or One World, where there is no separation of an act from its significance. 9. Session Nine: XXI, THE UNIVERSE This final session of the waxing fortnight is a grounding session. The po sition of the ego in the psychic economy is realized. The ego realizes its subordinate positi on to the Self. As the keyword is preservation of achievement , we might recall Vishnu, the Preserver. The role of Saturn in the preservation of tradition is also fundamental. *"},{"pageNumber":1176,"pageContent":"The Banishing Ritual and Middle Pillar Exercise enhance any of the sess ions. They are useful in calming the mind and focusing attention. They clear the confu sion of psychic imagery away and prevent distraction. Then one psychological state may be differe ntiated. There are a few extra hints that might be of help: a). If you should find it necessary to interrupt this cycle, try to do it aft er a session #9, and preferrably after a session #9 of the waxing fortnight. b). The time used for these meditations is totally arbitrary. Use as much time, or as little time, as you feel necessary. On the average, 10 to 15 minutes a day is a realistic goal; focu s attention on an image or god-form. c). No matter what the meditation time is, dedicate that same amount of time each special day specifically to this exercise. Cultivate consistency to improve your rit ual practice. d). The Spring Equinox is a fitting time to commence the resonance m editations. There are certain harmonics which are struck with the Solar cycle. INTRODUCTION TO ALCHEMY IN JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGY and, Alchemical Imagination: Making Psyche Matter by Iona Miller, 1986 Prepared as a class for Spring Quarter 1986, Rogue Community College. This class p rovided feedback and interaction which fed into my Phanes Press book, THE MODERN ALCHEMIST: A Guide to Personal Transformation , Miller & Miller (1994), covering both therapeutic healing and spiritual development through a series of alchemical plates from the Book of Lambspring , as a typical metaphorical process. Alchemy is much more than the historical pre decessor of metallurgy, chemistry and medicine -- it is a living form of sacred psychology. Alchemy is a projection of a cosmic and spiritual drama in laboratory terms. It is an art, both experiential and experimental. It is a worldview which unifies spirit and matter, Sun and Moon, Yang and Yin. "},{"pageNumber":1177,"pageContent":"Aeterna Saltatus , cAndrew Gonzales,www.sublimatrix.com Jung spent the better part of the end of his life studying the subject of alchemy, which has been called the search for the godhead in matter. In typical \"Jungian\" style, his in terest in alchemy developed from a vivid dream about an ancient library full of arcane books. Later, aft er much searching, Jung came to posses such a library. Alchemy reflected in symboli c form the same sorts of imagery Jung saw in his practice in neurosis, psychosis, dreams and imagination . Jung insisted that the psyche cannot be understood in conceptual terms, but only through livin g images or symbols, which are able to contain paradox and ambiguity. Alchemy reflects the process of personal transformation in the metaphor of transmuting base metals into gold. Jung was amazed to find that the images and operations he encountered in the old alchemy texts related strongly to his theories of psychoanalysis and the unconscious. Ther efore, his main research project at the culmination of his career was around this topic of alchemy and how it related to the dynamics of consciousness. Jung saw in alchemy a metaphor for the process of individuation, and the morphing and mutating imagery of that process which emerges from the stream of consciousness. Alchemy can also be viewed as a system of self-init iation. Jung often turned to the images of alchemy, mythology and religion to help describe psych ic life. For an image to be a living symbol it must refer to something that cannot be otherwi se known. Jung elaborated most of his alchemical analysis of the psyche in three major volumes of his Collected Works . They include Alchemical Studies, Psychology and Alchemy , and his final volume Mysterium Coniunctionis . Since the publication of these there have been other works of alchemical interest produced by notable Jungian analysts. Among these are th e following 2nd generation Jungians: 1). Foremost are the works of Marie-Louise vonFranz, who wrot e Alchemical Active Imagination , Projection and Recollection in Jungian Psychology, Number and Time , and Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and its Psychology , to name but a few. 2). Edward Edinger has given us the classical text, Ego and Archetype , plus Anatomy of the Psyche . Other contributors include Henry Corbin with Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth , on Arabic alchemy, M. Esther Harding's Psychic Energy , Robert Grinnell's Alchemy in a Modern Woman , and Edward Whitmont's Psyche and Substance . A 3rd generation has arisen in depth psychology which considers imagination or 'the imaginal' to be the primal reality. Es sentially unknowable, it can only be experienced through images by which it is expressed. It draws c onstantly on ancient elements of psychic life, which still abound in the modern world, s uch as ritual, gods and goddesses, dreams, alchemy and possession as well as aesthetics, etymology, hum or, sensuality, poetry, etc. James Hillman has written extensively on Anima Mundi in Spring, the Journal for Archetypal Psychology, and it has many alchemical articles such as \"Silver and the White Earth.\" Then there are the classical texts of alchemy, themselves, of course. Ther e is a vast array of alchemical texts, with staggering varieties of ways of expressing the alchemic al process, psychologically and experimentally. Many of them curiously contain homologues of the magic mushroom Amanita muscaria, (see Clark Heinrich's Forbidden Fruit ). Among these texts are The Book of Lambspring, Aurora Consurgens, Codicillus (by Raymond Lully), Splendor Solis, Theatrum Chemicum, and the Alchemical Writings of Edward Kelly . Liber Azoth and De Natura Rerum (among others) by Paracelsus are foundational. Other classics include The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkrutz and Rosarium Philosophorum which Jung used to illustrate his"},{"pageNumber":1178,"pageContent":"work The Psychology of the Transference . Finally, there are the modern translations of older works by A.E. Waite which include Turba Philosophorum, The Hermetic Museum, Lexicon of Alchemy, and The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus . Even newer are the compendiums such as The Secret Art of Alchemy by Stanislaus Klossowski De Rola and Alchemist's Handbook by Frater Albertus. There is a whole catalogue of astute alchemical literature available from Phanes Press, including in particular those with commentary by Adam McLean, such as The Alchemical Mandala, Splendor Solis , and The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz . Another Jungian contribution is Eliade's The Forge & the Crucible. For lesser known treatises, Jung's bibliographies are a gold mine. Jung wrote the foreword to the Taoist classic on alchemy, The Secret of the Golden Flower . Most of us, unfamiliar with the subtle nuances of alchemical practice, view it as the historical predecessor of our modern sciences, like medicine, chemistry, me tallurgy, etc. But, according to Jung's research, it seems to be much, much more. It is a curious fact that there is no single alchemy for us to examine. It is a cross-cultural phenomenon which has be en practiced in various forms by ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Christian Europeans, and the I slamic, Hindu, and Taoist faiths. All of these use symbols to depict a process of transformati on, whether this process is thought to occur inside (introverted) or outside (extroverted) of the human body. Although there are many types of alchemy, the main split is between intro- and ext roverted forms. The deciding factor is the direction of the practitioner's creativity. In his book, The Alchemical Tradition in the Late Twentieth Century , Richard Grossinger summarizes the basic components of the different alchemical paths, w hich he dubs 'planet science.' These include the following: 1. A theory of nature as made up of primary elements. 2. A belief in the gradual evolution and transformation of substance. 3. A system for inducing transmutation. 4. The imitation of nature by a gentle technology. 5. The faith that one's inner being is changed by participation in external chemical experiments. 6. A general system of synchronistic correspondences between planets, col ors, herbs, minerals, species of animals, signs and symbols, parts of the body, astrological signs, etc. kn own as the Doctrine of Signatures. 7. Gold as the completed and perfected form of the metals, in specific , and substance in general (Alchemy is the attempt to transmute other substances into gold, however t hat attempt is understood and carried out). 8. The existence of a paradoxical form of matter, sometimes called The Philosop her's Stone (the Lapis), which can be used in making gold or in brewing elixirs ( elixer vitae ) and medicines that have universal curative powers ( panacea ). 9. A method of symbolism working on the simultaneity of a series of complement ary pairs: Sun/Moon, Gold/Silver, Sulphur/Mercury, King/Queen, Male/Female, Hus band/Bride,"},{"pageNumber":1179,"pageContent":"Christ/Man, etc. 10. The search for magical texts that come from a time when the human race was closer to the source of things or are handed down from higher intelligences, extraterre strials, guardians, or their immediate familiars during some Golden Age. These texts deal w ith the creation or synthesis of matter and are a blueprint for physical experimentation in a c osmic context (as well as for personal development). They have been reinterpreted in terms of the Earth's different epochs and nationalities. 11. In the Occident, alchemy is early inductive experimental science and is closely allied with metallurgy, pharmacy, industrial chemistry, and coinage. 12. In the Orient, alchemy is a system of meditation in which one's body is u nderstood as elementally and harmonically equivalent to the field of creation. (Betwe en East and West, the body may be thought of as a microcosm of nature, with its own deposits of seeds, eli xirs, and mineral substances). 13. Alchemy is joined to astrology in a set of meanings that arise from the correspond ences of planets, metals, and parts of the body, and the overall belief in a cosmic timing t hat permeates nature. Thus, alchemy deals fundamentally with the basic mysteries of life as we ll as with transcendental mysticism. But its approach is neither abstract nor theoretical, but exp erimental, in nature. Just who were the alchemists, and why are their contributions importan t to us today? The alchemists were the leading explorers of consciousness in medieval ti mes, and their research led to a vast improvement in the conditions of life. Among the more famous are Albe rtus Magnus, Paracelsus, Nicholas Flammel, and Sir Isaac Newton. Their contributions n ot only improved the lives of their contemporaries, but influenced the thought of many philos ophers of the same and later eras, such as Meister Eckhart, Thomas a Kempis, John Dee, Johannes Kepl er, Thomas Vaughn, Bishop Berkeley, Emanuel Swedenborg, William Blake, and Goethe. The contribution of these eminent alchemists are staggering: Alber tus Magnus, alone, wrote eight books on physics, six on psychology, eight on astronomy, twenty-six on zoology, five on miner als, one on geography, and three on life in general from an Aristotelian point-of-vie w. He was a Dominican friar who was canonized a saint in 1931. Paracelsus was a Swiss born in 1493. His accomplishments were many and include being the first modern me dical scientist. He fathered the sciences of microchemistry, antisepsis, modern wound surgery , hypnosis and homeopathy. He wrote the first medical literature on the causes and treatment of syp hilis and epilepsy, as well as books on illness derived from adverse working conditions. Even with his accurate scientific bent, his work is also in close accor d with mystical alchemical tradition. His was a worldview of animism, ensouled and infused by a vari ety of spirits. He wrote on furies in sleep, on ghosts appearing after death, on gnomes in mines and und erground, of nymphs, pygmies, and magical salamanders. invisible forces were always at work an d the physician had to constantly be aware of this fourth dimension in which h e was moving. He utilized various techniques for divination and astrology as well as magical amul ets, talismans, and incantations."},{"pageNumber":1180,"pageContent":"Paracelsus believed in a vital force which radiated around every man like a l uminous sphere and which could be made to act at a distance. He is also credited with the earl y use of what we now know as hypnotism. He believed that there was a star in each man, (Mishlove) . This sentiment was echoed by 19th century magician and alchemist, Aleister Crowley, who said, \" Every man and every woman is a star.\" This alludes to the essential Self, but is also lite rally in that our elements were forged in some distant supernova. Kepler developed the laws of planetary motion. But he developed his t heories on the basis of explorations into the dimly lit archetypal regions of man's mind as surely as on his mathematical observations of the planetary motions. He was clearly a student in the tradit ion of earlier mystic- scientists such as Pythagoras and Paracelsus. Thomas Vaughn, Robert Fludd, an d Sire Frances Bacon number among the 17th century Rosicrucians who practiced not only alche my but also other hermetic arts and the qabalah. Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was a mathematical genius, as well as one of the greatest s cientists who ever lived. He discovered the binomial theorem, invented differenti al calculus, made the first calculations of the moon's attraction by the earth and described the laws of motion of classical mechanics, and formulated the theory of universal gravitation. He was very carefu l not to publish anything which was not firmly supported by experimental proofs or geometr ical demonstrations; thus he exemplified and ushered in the Age of Reason. However, if we look at Newton's own personal notes and diaries, over a million wor ds in his own handwriting, a startlingly different picture of the man emerges. Newt on was an alchemist though after his death his family burned many of his arcane manuscripts in an at tempt to hide the fact. He devoted himself to such endeavors as the transmutation of metals, the ph ilosopher's stone, and the elixir of life. He was intensely introspective and had great ment al endurance. He solved problems intuitively and dressed them up in logical proofs afterwards. H e, himself, was astounded by the startling nature of his own theories. Gravity is a problem that still hasn't been dealt with satisfactorily by scientists. His followers, however, emphasized exclusively his mechanistic view of t he universe to the exclusion of his religious and alchemical views. In a sense, their action us hered in a controversy in psychical research which has existed ever since. Since Newton's tim e, all discoveries suggesting the presence of spiritual force which transcended time or space wer e ironically considered to be a violation of Newton's Laws -- even though Newton himself held these very bel iefs! It is interesting to note, that today scientists actually can turn small amou nts of lead into gold through particle acceleration, since they are only one atomic weight apart, but the energy expense is prohibitive. Despite the advances in science, the \"unknown\" is st ill projected into the realm of matter, and the alchemical quest continues. Science is still debati ng over what is physical, what is psychic and what is metapsychic. VonFranz, in Projection and Recollection in Jungian Psychology , states that \"In Western cultural history the transpsychic has been de scribed sometimes as \"spirit\" sometimes as \"matter.\" Theologians and philosophe rs are more concerned with the former, physicists with the later.\" Since the dawn of the 21st century, many physicists openly speak of the spiritual nature of Reality, especially in the quantum realm -- the microcosm and foundation of the macrocosmic world. VonFranz points out that \"what was once regarded as the opposition between s pirit and matter"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"turns up again in contemporary physics as a discussion of the relation bet ween consciousness (or Mind) and matter.\" It bears on such questions as the bias of the observer, and the theories of relativity, probability, synchronicity, non-locality, not to mention the whole f ield of parapsychology. Multidisciplinary studies such as quantum consciousnes s, quantum chaos and quantum cosmology have manifested Jung's prescient vision. Jung really return ed us to the alchemistic viewpoint when he said, in Aion , \" Sooner or later nuclear physics and the psychology of the unconscious will draw closely together as both of them independently of one another and from opposite directions, push forward i nto transcendental territory. ...Psyche cannot be totally different from matt er for how otherwise could it move matter? And matter cannot be alien to psyche, for how else could matter produc e psyche? Psyche and matter exist in the same world, and each partakes of the other, otherw ise any reciprocal action would be impossible. If research could only advance far enough, therefore, we should arrive at an ultimate agreement between physical and psychological concepts. Our presen t attempts may be bold, but I believe they are on the right lines .\" (Jung). As vonFranz notes, \"There is therefore no concept fundamental to modern physics that is not in one degree or another a differentiated form of some primordial archetypal idea.\" These include our concepts of time, space, energy, the field of force, particle theory, and chemical affinity. Laws in physics are subject to scientific revolutions and there has be en a major breakthrough in paradigms shifts about every 20 years, or each generation. One of the most influ ential recently is Complexity or Chaos Theory. VonFranz says, \"As soon as an archetypal idea that has been serving as a model no longer coincides with the observed facts of the external world, it is dropped or its origin in the psyche is recognized. This process always coincides wi th the upward thrust of a new thought-model from the unconscious to the threshold of conscious ness.\" This is basically the process of weeding out \"scientific errors.\" \" ...scarcely a thought is given to what they might mean, psychologically, once they are no longer fit to serve as a model in describing the outer world.\" This certainly happened to alchemy, until Jung revived an interest in it.. \"It is only today, when we know that the assumptions of the observer decisively precondition the total results, that the question is becoming acute.\" Ph ysicists have become increasingly conscious of the extent to which psychological circumstance s influence their results. This \"hard problem\" of the subjectivity of our personal experience is t he crux of consciousness studies and a sticking point in all neurologically-based descriptions of brain-mind dynamics, whether it is based in the quantum, holographic, electromagnetic, or che mical interactions. Other experimental-minded persons have sought the mysteries of lif e and divinity within their own bodies, since ancient times. Some employed entheogenic plants and e lixirs, while others manipulated the paradoxical switch of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ar ousal systems through yoga or magick. Whether known as Yogis or Adepts, their goal was basically the s ame, as we shall see. Some modern schools of the Hermetic Arts see an identity between m edieval European alchemy and the eastern practice of Yoga. They see a metaphysical or symbolic correspond ence between the planetary and metallurgical attributions of alchemy and the chakras. Yoga i s also experimental in nature; the experiment is performed on oneself. The q ualities of the metals correspond to the planets and chakras as follows."},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":" Lead Saturn Sacral Plexus Iron Mars Sexual Ganglion Tin Jupiter Solar Plexus Gold Sun Cardiac Plexus Copper Venus Pharyngeal Plexus Silver Moon Pituitary Body Quicksilver Mercury Pineal Gland "},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"Alchemy is not concerned exclusively with consciousness, but also seeks the subtle transformation of the body, so that the physical level is also brought into perfect equilibr ium. Thus, the alchemical metals may be considered analogous to the chakras of the yogis. We can draw another par allel among the three major principles of alchemy and those of Yoga, which are k nown as the Gunas. Mercury..........Sattva Sulphur.........Rajas Salt..........Tamas The quality of Mercury is vital and reflective; it equates with the sp iritual principles of goodness and intelligence; Sattva guna is illuminative. The quality of Sulph ur is fiery and passionate like the principles of Rajas, which incites desire, attachm ent and action. The quality of Salt is arrestive and binding, and reflects the gross inertia of matter, w hich is much like Tamas. These gunas and the three alchemical substances symbolize spirit , soul and body. Another \"alchemical\" way the gunas were applied concerns food: sattvic food s incline one toward meditation and the spiritual life (fruits, vegetables, nuts, and gr ains); rajasic foods are stimulating (i.e. spicy food); tamasic food incites the baser instincts (animal flesh). The concept of four basic elements, harmonized in a fifth, is also common to b oth alchemy and yoga doctrines. The Indian elements are known as Tattvas. They are: Akasha (quint essence); Tejas or Agni (fire); Apas (water); Vayu (air); Prithivi (earth). Furt hermore, the preparation for the practice of both alchemy and yoga requires a moral or ethical preparati on. Both stress that evil tendencies should be overcome while positive virtues are dev eloped. This includes both behavior and the purification of various body centers. The objective is not w ealth, but health or wholeness. Alchemy also speaks of a \"secret fire\", which is often compared to a serpen t or dragon. Here again, we find the correspondence to Kundalini, the serpent-power. Alc hemy is performed by the aid of Mercury, the illuminative principle, and the powers of the s un and moon. Both alchemists and Tantrics practice with the essential aid, sometimes s exual, of a mystical sister, the alchemist's soror mystica or yogi's yogini, complement of King/Queen, Shiva-Shakti, God/Goddess joined together in the miracle marriage. The yogic system w orks in three channels in the subtle body. One equates with the sun, another with the moon. T hey are called ida and pingala . The third, or harmonizing channel, is known as sushumna , and is associated with illumination. The twin serpents twine together and open the third way, as shown in the Cadeusus. The yogi seeks to arouse the latent power of the Kundalini serpent so it ris es up the chakra centers until it opens the third eye of mystical vision and illuminat ion. Alchemists apply slow heat to their alchemical vessel to sublimate and refine the contents th erein. The yogis use breath control, the alchemists bellows to control the fire. Interestingly, yogis e mploy breathing exercises called \"breath of fire\" and \"the bellows.\" In summary, the points of correspondence resulting in the alchemical p roduction of a new kind of human being (one made hale or whole) are as follows: 1. Both systems agree that all things are expressions of one fundamental ener gy."},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"2. Both affirm that all things combine three qualities: a. Wisdom, Sattva , superconsciousness or Mercury; b. Desire, Rajas , compulsion or Sulpher; c. Inertia or Tamas , darkness, or Salt. 3. Both recognize five modes of expression: Akasha , Spirit or the quintessence; Tejas or Agni , fire; Apas , water; Vayu , air; Prithivi , earth. 4. Both systems mention seven principle vehicles of activity called chakras by yogis, and metals by alchemists. 5. Both say there is a secret force, fiery in quality, which is to be raised from on e chakra or metal to another, until the power of all seven is sublimated to the higher. 6. Yoga says 1) Prana or Surya , sun, 2) Rayim , moon, and 3) Sattva , wisdom are the three agencies of the work (or ida, pingala and sushumna ). Alchemy says the whole operation is a work of the sun and moon, aided by Mercury. 7. Both systems stress preparation by establishing physical purity and et hical freedom from lust, avarice, vanity, attachment, anger and other anti-social tendencies. 8. Both allege that success enables the adepts to exercise extraordinary power s, to heal all diseases, and to control all the forces of nature so as to exert a determining inf luence on circumstances. In short, what both alchemist and yogi do is 1). to recognize what goes on in his body, and 2). to use his knowledge of the control exerted over subconscious processes b y self-consciousness to form a definite intention that this body-building function shall act wi th maximum efficiency creating increased vitality. This supercharge of libido then wakens th e spiritual vision of the pineal gland to full activity (in some modern interpretations overriding i nhibitory mechanisms for the production of endogenous DMT). The Great Work of alchemy consists of stab ilizing this vision of Light into a full realization. The by-product is that the body-buil ding power of the subconscious changes the alchemist him/herself into a new creature . Jung asserted that the medieval alchemists were unaware of the natural pr ocess of psychological transformation which went on in their subconscious. Ther efore, they projected this process into their experiments as a science of the soul. In other w ords, they projected an inner process outside of themselves. Had they been more conscious in t heir intent or more sophisticated in their psychology like the yogis, they would have been more consistently successful at producing the coveted lapis or Philosopher's Stone, a sort of \"quantum Tantra.\" But why is a study of alchemy relevant to our modern lives, even if we have a spiri tual orientation? We are not daily occupied with pseudo-alchemical experiment s like the alchemists, or are we? In many metaphorical ways we are thinking like alchemists all t he time. Also, Jung observed that the dreams of his clients repeatedly stressed the mai n alchemical themes, especially the conflict and union of opposites. One of the main symbols of re conciliation of this conflict are various mandala forms, present from alchemy to Tibetan Buddh ism. The alchemical symbolism is widespread in dreams of modern individuals, an d can shed light on these more primitive aspects of our subconscious life. It is importan t for our understanding of our own unconscious, and how it transcends and subverts us. Plato enjoine d us to \"Know"},{"pageNumber":1185,"pageContent":"Thyself.\" In Alchemical Active Imagination , vonFranz states, \" True knowledge of oneself is the knowledge of the objective psyche as it manife sts in dreams and in the manifestations of the unconscious. Only by looking at dreams, for inst ance, can one see who one truly is; they tell us who we really are, that is something which is objectively there. To meditate on that is an effort towards self-knowledge, because that is scientific and objective and not in the interest of the ego but in the interest of \"what I am\" objectively. It is knowledge of the Self, of the wider, objective personality. \" We could view alchemy as an antique form of psychophysical therapy, which origi nally had the meaning 'to heal,' and the implication of 'service to the gods.' Psychotherapy b asically means service to the psyche, and offers us a way to reconnect with out unconsciou s, thus experiencing wholeness. It also opens an avenue to increased physical health, since those ailments which remain unconscious often manifest as psychosomatic diseases. Knowledge of alchemy's symbolism can lead us to psychological insight in terms of our own conditions, es pecially that reflected in dreams. Alchemy may be carried out as either a physical or mental operation. The Jungi an orientation is primarily mental, though it often takes a physical form or expression. For e xample, you might choose to ritually 'act out' certain aspects of the Great Work in active imagi nation. The Jungian interpretation that alchemy is a passive and unconscious process comes fr om a basically mental, or Greek orientation. The type of alchemy that aims at rejuvenation or prese rving the physical body is descended from the physically-oriented Egyptian alchemy. The main traditions of conscious, inner spiritual alchemy come mainly from the Islamic and Oriental philosophies. Jung's original interest in alchemy came from a dream he had of a library fi lled with arcane tomes from medieval times and the Renaissance. During the next 15 years he spent collecting this library, he learned to recognize the major symbols of the unconscious . He was reading about them in alchemy books and hearing about them in his patients' drea ms and fantasies. Their projections recurrently told him of an inner quest, a sealed vesse l, the conflict of opposites, a philosophical tree, a fountain of eternity, a golden flower, a Stone, a sac red wedding, etc. Slowly Jung familiarized himself with their alchemical meaning. Then he, himself, became a living symbol of the healing power of the Philosopher's Stone -- a guide to th e depths of the unknown. In his case this power manifested as the ability to heal at the ps ychophysical level -- in other words, to release any blocks hindering the natural process of growth and transformation. When proceeding in the direction of their individuation his clients' harmony was restored, self- equilibration returned. Jung equated individuation with self-real ization. We should be careful here not to dichotomize between \"mental\" and \"physical\" too much or we wi ll lose our proper alchemical perspective. Alchemy cannot be reduced to a metaphor of psyc hological or philosophical transformation -- it requires first-hand experimen tation. Grossinger says that \"what Carl Jung recognized was that the stages of the alche mists also corresponded to a process of psychological individuation. The psychic stages were as precise and rigorous as the chemical ones by which they became imagined. Furtherm ore, they generated a physical and even quantitative terminology for an undiagnosed tensi on of opposites in the human psyche arising from male and female archetypes, a struggle th ey sought to resolve"},{"pageNumber":1186,"pageContent":"by the creative unity of the chemicals in the Stone.\" Alchemy sought to unite Spirit (male), and Matter (female) through a Royal Union (coniunctio) to create their synthe sis in the homunculus, hermaphrodite, or lapis. This is an alchemical metaphor or version of the ge neric process of spiritual rebirth. The entire body of alchemical literature covers many variations on the them e of the Great Work. No single person will ever express all of the operations and symbols desc ribed in alchemy, just as no single person ever embodies the totality of the Self. We e ach have unique experiences of the common roots of humanity or the collective unconscious . Thus, the various operations of alchemy come in different order for the various practitioner s. The alchemical writings seem to contradict one another about the evolution of the process . Some claim to have made the Stone and lost it, over and over -- like the elusive revelations of a ps ychedelic trip. Likewise, in dreams we sometimes find the symbols of the end-product (like a mandala, or flower, or child) appearing at the beginning of the process. They symbolize what is latent and seeks manifestation. Nevertheless, in both alchemy and Jungian psychology there are classic stages in the process of individuation or personal experience of the unconscious -- psychic mile stones. One major recurrent theme in modern dreams is the symbolism of the planets , which correspond with the alchemical metals. These metals, or planets (astrology), archetypes (dept h psychology) or Spheres (QBL) can be understood psychologically as the building blocks of the ego, which forms itself from fragments of these divine archetypal qualities. These spir itual principles seek concretization through the unique experience of an individual ego. This li nks spirit and matter; it comes down to earth. The sacredness of the Opus, or Great Work, is the central idea behind alc hemy. It is a holistic perspective. One must be self-oriented, rather than ego-oriented . The adept is also diligent, patient and virtuous. In other words, in order to create the Stone, you must have that integrative potential within yourself for self-realization -- for becom ing whole or 'holy.' It requires an inward seeking, just like the process of individuation. It i s a solitary task for no one may follow where you go. But there may be guides who will help inspire your fait h and dedication to the task. Others have been to the territory you will explore, bu t none will accompany you. The secret of alchemy is that it is a personal journey of transformation, and can not be explained but only experienced. It is \"eating the dish,\" not just reading about it i n an alchemical cookbook. Its effects must be channeled into spiritual growth, for if alch emy is used to gratify personal desire the work is lost. This means the ego gets inflated with it s own importance when the real power source lies within the Self. This naturally produces a r egression back into an unconscious state, back to the prima materia, raw psychic material. The instinctual urge for growth and transformation lies within us. For this urge to be considered e volutional requires that the ego must cooperate quite deliberately and consciously with th e Self. This leads toward self-realization. The main purpose of the Opus is \"to create a transcendent, miraculous substance which is variously symbolized as the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of Life, or the un iversal medicine (panacea). The procedure is, first, to find the suitable material, the so c alled prima materia (lead), and then to subject it to a series of operations which will turn i t into the Philosopher's"},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"Stone (gold).\" (Edinger, 1978). The First Matter is a homogenous unity of Mercury, Sulfur and Salt. It is t herefore 'three,' but can also be expressed as 'four' elements, which are again essentially 'one.' Ju ng felt that the secret of the psyche was contained in this question of the 'three' and the 'four.' In alchemy it is expressed as the axiom of Maria Prophetessa: \"Therefore the Hebrew pr ophetess cried without restraint: 'one becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third c omes the One as the fourth.'\" Today, physicists echo this statement when they call 'plasma' b oth the fourth and first state of matter (the others being liquid, gas and solid). In Jungian psychology, the prima materia is the original undifferentiated condition of ordinary consciousness, which is really unconsciousness -- subjective awaren ess. Mystics of all times have repeated that in the ordinary state we are all asleep or even \"dead\" to the tru e Reality. In psychology the four-fold nature of the prima materia is expressed by the f our functions which correspond with the alchemical elements: intuition (fire), thin king (air), feeling (water), and sensation (earth). In Jungian theory we have a dominant function and limited access to one or two others, but the fourth function is inaccessible, elusive, maladapted , or hard to integrate. It is what keeps us from \"getting it all together.\" Thus, we are out-of-balance. Balancing the four functions means achieving an integrated personality, harm ony and well- being. This requires undergoing a symbolic process of the union of opposite s, which is what both alchemy (and Tantra) and Jungian analysis are all about. Both alchemy and Jungian psychology require a period of depth analysis (solutio) to distinguish the or iginal, undifferentiated contents. The ego learns what part of the personality com es from itself and which parts from the Self. It reflects on its own component parts (s ubpersonalities) and learns to see itself as a small part of a greater whole, the larger unity of the Self. Edin ger says, \"The fixed, settled aspects of the personality which are rigid and static are r educed or led back to their original, undifferentiated condition as part of the process of psych ic transformation,\" i.e. back to a state of 'innocence.' Further, Edinger compares the problem of discovering the prima materi a to the problem of finding what to work on in psychotherapy. He gives some hints: (1) It is ubiquitous, to be found everywhere, before the eyes of all. This m eans that psychotherapeutic material likewise is everywhere, in all the ordinary , everyday occurrences of life. Moods and petty personal reactions of all kinds are suitable matter to be worked on by the therapeutic process. (2) Although of great inward value, the primal materia is vile in outer appearanc e and therefore despised, rejected or thrown on the dung heap. The prima materia is treated like th e suffering servant in Isaiah. Psychologically, this means that the primal materia is found in the shadow, that part of the personality which is considered most despicable. Those aspects of our selves most painful and most humiliating are the very ones to be brought forward and worked on. (3) It appears as multiplicity, \"has as many names as there are things,\" but at t he same time is one. This feature corresponds to the fact that initially psychotherapy makes one awar e of his/her fragmented, disjointed condition. Very gradually these warring fragments are di scovered to be differing aspects of ones underlying unity. It is as though one sees the fi ngers of a hand touching a"},{"pageNumber":1188,"pageContent":"table at first only in two dimensions, as separate unconnected fingers. Wit h three-dimensional vision, the fingers are seen as part of a larger unity, the hand. (4) The prima materia is undifferentiated, without definite boundaries, li mits or form. This corresponds to a certain experience of the unconscious which exposes the ego to t he infinite. ...It may evoke the terror of dissolution or the awe of eternity. It provides a glimpse of the pleroma. ...the chaos prior to the operation of the World-creating Logos. It is the fear of the boun dless that often leads one to be content with the ego-limits he has rather than risk fall ing into the infinite by attempting to enlarge them. The different operations to transform the prima materia follow as the nat ural consequences of finding the material to work on. The imagery associated with these operation s is profuse and draws from myth, religion and folklore. The symbols for all these imagery -systems comes from the collective unconscious. There is no set number of alchemical opera tions, just as there is no set number or order to archetypes. However, certain of the operations seem to recur more often in the liter ature and experience. We could consider these as the skeletal frame of the alchemical proces s. Their order switches around also. Edinger lists seven operations which seem to typify the major tr ansformations of the alchemical process. These include: calcinatio , solutio, coagulatio, sublimatio, mortificatio, separatio, and coniunctio . Other major operations include nigredo, albedo, rubedo, solificatio, multiplicatio, projectio, separatio, circulatio , and more. We can detail the nature of each of these operations later. For now, it is enough t o grasp the overview which is best stated by Jung, himself, in Mysterium Coniunctionis : \".. .the alchemist saw the essence of his art in separation and analysis [solve or solutio] on the on e hand and synthesis and consolidation [coagula or coagulatio] on the other. For him there was first of al l an initial state in which opposite tendencies or forces were in conflict; secondly, t here was the great question of a procedure which would be capable of bringing the hostile elements and qualities , once they were separated, back to unity again. The initial state, named chaos, was not given from the start but had to be sought for as the prima materia. And just as the beginning of the work was not self-evident, so to an even greater degree was its end. There are countless speculations on the nature of the end state , all of them reflected in its designations. The commonest are the ideas of its permanence (prolongation of life, immortality, incorruptibility), its androgyny, its spirituality and corporeality, its divin ity and its resemblance to man (homunculus). \" He goes on to point out what this might mean psychologically. We could view it as confli cting drives originating on the spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical levels c reating splits in the personality. Jung says that, \" The obvious analogy, in the psychic sphere, to this problem of opposites is the dissociation of the personality brought about by the conflict of inc ompatible tendencies resulting as a rule from an inharmonious disposition. The repr ession of one of the opposites leads only to a prolongation and extension of the conflict, in other words, to a neu rosis. The therapist therefore confronts the opposites with one another and aims at un iting them permanently. The images of the goal which then appear in dreams often run parallel with the corresponding alchemical symbols .\""},{"pageNumber":1189,"pageContent":"He reiterates the value of accessing the alchemical symbolism for incre asing insight. \" Investigation of the alchemical symbolism, like a preoccupation with mythol ogy, does not lead one away from life anymore than a study of comparative anatomy leads away from the anatom y of the living man. On the contrary, alchemy affords us a veritable treasure-house of symbols, knowledge of which is extremely helpful for an understanding of neurotic and psychotic processes. This, in turn, enables us to apply the psychology of the unconscious to those regions in th e history of the human mind which are concerned with symbolism .\" Each of the operations of alchemy functions as the center of focus of an elab orate symbol- system. Other symbols which are related to the operation cluster around the theme of the operation -- they share a common essence. These central symbols provide basic categories which we can use to understand our own personal psychic life, and even the transf ormation processes of others. Taken together, the alchemical operations illustrate almost all of the full range of experiences which are involved in the process of individuation. As Grossinger points out, \" Alchemy is thus a form of chemical research into which unresolved psychic elements were projected. The alchemical nigredo, the initial phase of the operation which produces 'black blacker than black,' is also an internal experience of melancholia, an en counter with the shadow .\" But this is also the necessary first stage in Jungian analysis -- confrontin g that which has been rejected or repressed is essential to becoming whole. This realm of th e shadow can often provide more real substance for the spiritual quest than mimicking the teach ings of a spiritual master without really changing oneself. Though stumbling around in the dark se ems frustrating, if it is honest and heartfelt, and one really grapples with the shadow problem, the way is cleared for progress that will be sustained by a firm foundation gained in the early phase s. Throughout the alchemical process, the lapis functions as an inner guide b y presenting itself in diverse symbolism. It symbolizes the growing manifestation of your laten t potential for wholeness. It frequently manifests in mandala symbolism. This includ es such forms as a revolving wheel or the zodiac, the petals of a magnificent flower, or a serpent eat ing its tail. As a grand union of opposites, it symbolizes the unification of king and queen , man and wife, conscious and unconscious, personality and society, etc. in a royal union called t he Marriage of the Sun and Moon in alchemy Alchemy is a means of understanding our uncons cious projections of archetypes into the world. In \"Spiritual Development as Reflected in Alchemy and Related Disci plines,\" Rudolf Bernoulli summarizes the basics of extroverted and introverted alchemy. He says, \"T here are two kinds of alchemy: one strives to know the cosmos as a whole and to recreate it; it i s in a sense the precursor of modern natural science. It aspires to create gold as the su preme perfection in this sphere...The other alchemy strives higher; it strives for the great wonde r, the wonder of all wonder, the magic crystal, the philosopher's stone.\" \" This is not a substance susceptible of chemical analysis. It does not repres ent a spiritual or psychological state that can be reduced to a clear formula. It is something more t han perfection, something through which perfection can be achieved. It is the universal i nstrument of magic. By it we can attain to the ultimate. By it we can completely possess the world. By i t we can make ourselves free from the world, by soaring above it. This is alchemy in the m ystical sense ...The goal"},{"pageNumber":1190,"pageContent":"is reached only when a man succeeds in creating the ...stone within himse lf, and this is made possible only the intervention of the 'inner master. '\" i.e. the Self. Psychologically, the union of body and spirit or of conscious and unconscious can b e safely attempted only when both have undergone a purification brought about by the e arlier stages of analysis, in which the conscious character and the personal unconscious ar e reviewed and set in order. ( Psychic Energy , p. 452-3). In the alchemistic literature there is evidence that the myster ious coniunctio took place in three stages. The first is that of the union of opposites, the double conjuncti on, which chiefly concerns us here. The second stage effects a triple union, that of body, soul, and spi rit; or, as it is said elsewhere, \"the Trinity is reduced to a Unity.\" In the Book of Lambspring , published in 1625, this triple union is represented first by two fi shes swimming in the sea, pictured with the legend, \"The sea is the Body, the t wo fishes are the Soul and the Spirit\", and later by a second picture showing a deer and a unicorn in a forest, with the following text: In the Body [the forest] there is Soul [the deer] and Spirit [the unicorn ] ...He that knows how to tame and master them by art, and to couple them together, may justly be called a maste r, for we rightly judge that he has attained the golden flesh . The literature offers far less material about this more advanced stage of the work than about the simple coniunctio, and still less about the third stage, the union of the four elements, from which the fifth element, the \"quintessence,\" arises. However, Jung' s latest works are largely concerned with the problems of this fourfold coniunctio, through whi ch not only are the personal parts of the psyche -- ego and anima, or ego and animus -- consummated, bu t these, in a further stage of development, are in turn united with their transper sonal correlates -- wise man and prophetess, or great mother and magician (under whatever names the se superordinate elements are conceived). The subject is by no means simple, but it ampl y repays careful study. Further definitions and descriptors of the dynamics of alchemy can be f ound in my book THE MODERN ALCHEMIST , (Phanes Press, 1994) which is divided into two major parts, each representing an 'octave' of the famous alchemical dictum, \" Solve et Coagula \": I.

Professor Wolfgang Pauli In the alchemical search for the God-head in matter (Kether in Malku th), Paracelsus contended that matter was a living counterpart of the creating deity. A system of corre spondences is the foundation of alchemy. The conception of a primal event manifested in di fferent fields is fundamental to alchemy. The process in the retort vessel is analogous to the pr ocess of transformation of the psyche. Through alchemy, we can perceive the parallels between microcosm, universe, and man. Alchemy is based on the assumption that the eq uation world = man = God is Truth. The metaphorical perception of alchemy grew a new taproot in the Jungian sch ool of psychology. It emphasizes the process of psychological transformation. This is the Opus, or Great Work of alchemy in one of its contemporary forms, through there are still alchemists who work with elixers, nostrums and potions or in experiments with metallu rgy, preferring the concrete form. Alchemy is called the Great Work because that which \"wor ks\" is that which has the active power to transform. The experiments are performed on oneself. This experiential act renews the alchemical philosophy which is pr imarily concerned with the union of psyche and matter. There is an indissoluble unity in alchemy be tween theory and practice. They are explicate aspects (which are experienced through a me taphorical sensory perception) of the Quest, or attainment of 'immortality' through the un ion of opposites. Thus, the goal of the Opus is precisely this union, which is known variousl y as the Philosopher's Stone, Royal Marriage or Unus Mundus (experience of one worldview uniting the p syche/body/spirit). Paracelsus described alchemy as the voluntary action of man in harmony with the involuntary action of nature. If the center of the creative process takes place in th e \"heart of man\", his intentions take on profound significance. They can now influence the d estiny of the cosmos. Attainment of this intentionality is known as the production of the Dia mond Body, the stabilization of emergent magical perspectives and abilities. In moder n terms, it means out-of- the-box thinking and being, a departure from mundane or ordinary consensu s reality, but not in a dissociative or psychotic way -- but in a way that approaches Reality more c losely. In modern consciousness studies, it can be likened to quantum consciousn ess, or a flow state. Alchemy strives for the experience of spiritual rebirth via the union of opposites, or the sacred marriage. The sacred marriage is characterized as the union of the Sun (+) and Moon (-). These polarized positions may be symbolized variously as positive-negative; yang-yin; m ale-female; god-devil; spirit-matter; father-mother, etc. The sacred marriage, o r coniunctio, creates a bond by which opposites are united in an image which transcends both origin al potentials. The whole art of alchemy is contained within the image (implicate order) of a magical or d ivine child. There is an inherent paradox in alchemy: all the while stressing redemp tion of the physical"},{"pageNumber":1193,"pageContent":"body, or matter, alchemy is actively striving toward creation of a subtle, immortal bod y, which has no apparent physical basis (magical child = body of light). This central problem in alchemy is the spiritual redemption of the p hysical body, which has effectively been cut off from our spirituality in modern life by our c ulturally-rooted mind/body split. Alchemy requires resurrection of the soul of body. The challe nge one encounters in developing and \"owning\" this fresh worldview is to \"see through\" to a uni fied vision of mundane physical processes with spiritual values and vision. This de velops awareness of the psychophysical ordering processes inherent in matter -- in our matte r. The solution is to visualize the physical body as a living metaphor -- a metaphorm -- for psychic tr ansformation. For the true alchemist, according to vonFranz (1979), \"... the mystery of the structure of the universe, was in themselves, i n their own bodies and in that part of the personality which we call the unconscious, but they would say in t he life of their own material existence. ...They thought that instead of taking outer materials you could just as well look inside and get information directly from that mystery because you were it . After all, you too were a part of the mystery of cosmic existence, so you could just as well watch it di rectly . Even further, you could ask matter, the mystery of which you consist, to t ell you what it is, to reveal itself to you. Instead of treating it like a dead object to be thrown into a vessel and the n cooked in order to see what came out, you could just as well take a block of iron, for instance, and ask it what it was, what its kind of life was, what it was doing, how it felt when melted. But since all these materials are within you, you can also contact them directly and in that way th ey contacted what we would now call the collective unconscious, which to them was also projecte d into the inner aspect of their own bodies . They consulted these powers directly through what they called meditatio n and therefore most of these introverted alchemists always stressed the fact that one should not only experiment outwardly but should always insert phases of introversion with prayer and meditation and a ki nd of yoga. With yoga meditation you try to get the right hypothesis, or information, about w hat you are doing or about the materials. Or you can, for instance, talk to quicksilver, or to iron, and if y ou talk to quicksilver and iron then naturally the unconscious fills up the gap by a person ification. Then Mercury appears to you and tells you who the sun God is. A power, the soul of Gold, appears an d tells you who and what it is. (Marie-Louise vonFranz, Alchemical Active Imagination , Spring Pub., Dallas, 1979). So, we see that basically the dynamic impulses of the original alchemists an d modern physicists is the same -- to have a dialogue with matter and to find out all that is possi ble about how the creative process (God, to some) works. This Opus, or Work, is understood as taking place in a sealed retort vessel. T he nature of this vessel is the original of the common-use term, \"Hermetically sealed.\" Th is containment insures that none of the ingredients will be lost, and also provides a container in wh ich the contents (\"raw perceptions and emotions\") are slowly heated, or cooked (calcinatio). T he initial material (prima materia) then goes through several stages of transformation, define d as operations, or experimental stages. Only that which has been properly separated can be united. These are not always presented in the same sequence in alchemical te xts. Most, however,"},{"pageNumber":1194,"pageContent":"include forms of calcinatio (heating); solutio (dissolving); coagulatio (con gealing); sublimatio (ennobling); mortificatio or nigredo (blackening); ablutio (whitening) ; separatio (separating), and coniunctio (uniting). There are also operations of refinement, circ ulating, multiplying, and reiterating. Each stage displays typical colors and properties or qualities . The meditatio, or meditation, consists of inner dialogue with the alche mical figures: Saturn=lead; Luna=silver; Sol=gold; Mercury=quicksilver; Venus=copp er; Mars=iron; Jupiter=tin. Because the process of alchemy does not extend into the Super nal Triad of the Tree of Life, it yields Self-Realization, not God-realization. It is a path of immane nce, rather than transcendence. This does not exclude transcendence from happening th rough God's grace, however. Then Kether is in Malkuth, the beginning (prima materia) and e nd (ultima materia) are paradoxically a co-temporaneous One. In alchemy, the Anima Mundi, or Soul of the World acts as the soul-guide to th e highest region. We experience An-imaginal (anima-ginal) Reality -- the world ensouled as l iving divinity, consciousness in its material unconsciousness. The putrefying conte nts of our psychophysical existence are elevated through insight and revisioning to the very means of o ur rebirth, and the unblocked, clear perception of our existential Reality. Always remember that the body is of vital importance in any alchemical oper ation. To transcend somewhere out of the body is not alchemical practice; rath er, imagine the body NOWHERE, or now-here, fully present as the psychophysical self and its mul ti-dimensional holographic projection. Alchemy views our human condition as a psychophysical \" Cosmosis,\" \" As Above; So Below \", hence we are permeated with and of the same essence and substanc e as the divine.: \" ...a physiological mythology juxtaposed with a cosmogonic mythology. In between is the psyche itself - the arcane substance, the subject factor - which achieves a pers onified level in the divinities of mythology. It is the psyche's own image-making activity, its self-creatio n through symbols, that is central to this model. It represents a process of the \"psychization of in stinct,\" the transformation of instinctual and biophysical phenomena into psychic experience. These phenomena can then to a certain extent be brought within the range of conscious will and reason. In thi s process instinct loses some of its primordial autonomy. It is an opus contra naturam, so to speak. ...Alch emy accordingly gives us a model for the psychology of projection; it points at once \"upwar d\" and \"downward.\" It is radically symbolic in its insistence on the \"arcanum.\" An d finally, in the obligation it imposed for the careful elaboration of theoria, it included the formation of apperceptive concepts and symbols as a fundamental part of the opus.\" ( Robert Grinnel, \"Alchemy and Analytical Psychology\", Methods of Treatment in Analytical Psychology, Spring Pub., Dallas, 1980). We can correspond the alchemist's metals and operations with the spher es of the Tree of Life: The prima materia is the original starting condition of the Probationer or N eophyte; in Malkuth, the earthy sphere one meets mortificatio, putrefactio, calci natio; The Saturn Path, THE UNIVERSE = lead; which brings us to the lunar sphere, Yesod, and it s alchemical attributes of silver and albedo. The mental sphere of Hod or Mercury (qui cksilver; Mercurius) is balanced against the emotional sphere of Netzach, Venus (copper; bened ictas veriditas); they are joined by the Mars-path, which is clearly rubedo, the \"reddening.\" Th is path is bisected by the Sagittarian path, ART/TEMPERANCE, which is the formula of Solve et Coagul a,"},{"pageNumber":1195,"pageContent":"culminating in the solar sphere of Tiphareth (gold, Sol, Lapis, solificatio, M inor Adept; self- actualization). The Mars sphere of Gedulah (Strength) is also linked wi th iron, while Chesed or Mercy is tin. We can examine what happens in initiation to the body/soul at the level of Malk uth for example, more closely. The process of alchemical initiation begins with the stage known as mortificatio, or psychological masochism. It means the death of the old personality for the the sake of the rebirth of the new renascent form or self-image. It means the disint egration of the conscious personality. It is specifically a spiritual or religious crisis in the li fe of the individual, where ruling ideas lose their meaning. Needless to say, this can be a depressing state of being, a loss of meaning. This c lassical depression is imaged in terms of \"blackening\" and has, therefore, to do wi th the Shadow. Depression necessitates a confrontation with one's own shadow, (self- defeating and self- destructive urges and patterns), not only as your personal inherent \"evil \", but as one's unlived life also for good. The actual process occurs as pathworking of XXI, The Univer se, which corresponds through its Saturn attribute with the nigredo. To derive pleasure from punishing one's body is a curious pathological image. B ut, read metaphorically, we can see how we virtually flog our selves in a variety of ways, alm ost compulsively. We do it through stress, through overwork, through role-bound dr ives, through \"shoulds\" and \"ought tos\" -- we keep ourselves in virtual bondage. At least by mid-life, we ask the classic question of our consumer society, \"Is this all that there is ?\" Our over-developed egos desperately try to maintain control over everything and everyone, but ourselves - and this tendency runs wild in our self-defeating and self-destructive add ictions, including escapist consumerism. We are so used to trying desperately to dominate our reality, and w hat we really need to do is \"let go\" of our outworn rigidities. Intuitively we know that the one who dies still in the fast lane with t he most toys doesn't necessarily win. We sense there is more to life and long to connect with it, to be reined in by it. The unheroic, self-humiliation and putting ourselves down with ne gative self-talk, is a form of masochism with a potentially religious aim: to gain forgiveness through a mode of redemption. This dedication to suffering -- to amplifying suffering -- produces me aning, compassion, humility, and healing. But it is an alchemical stage, not a way of life -- not suffe ring for suffering's sake. It is a discipline of the soul which contradicts t he ego attitude, but those with chronic depression seem stuck in this stage, unable to escape the black mood. Seeking its archetypal background, we see there is a relationship betwe en ritual flogging in initiation ceremonies and the intoxication of masochistic mortification . The same might be said of piercing or tattooing as behavioral expressions of this archetype, finding ple asure in the pain. The participant is entranced, connects with his/her pain, and enters the transformative process through a breaking of boundaries. The combination of humiliation and pleasure and unknownness yields an experience of ambivalence, a primal condition of psyche. It heralds a submission to the divine. \"Mortificatio is a psychological operation, not a moral one. We cannot apply a moral frame of reference to it; it is neither good nor bad, better nor worse. It is a necessary, ju st-so operation. One alchemical text advises, \"Take the old black spirit and destroy and torture it...\" Anoth er"},{"pageNumber":1196,"pageContent":"philosopher tells us that \"The tortured thing, when it is immersed in the body, changes it into an unalterable and indestructible nature.\" So the operation is necessary, not t o make us morally better or spiritually purer, but rather to change us. When we immerse masochisti c material in the body of fantasy, psyche and psychic reality become indestructible. The operation is ne cessary, not for the sake or moral ego-strengthening, but to make hard psychic reality. If we could full y realize this, that mortification is a way into the weighty, heavy matter of the soul, it mi ght help us get past the momentary cringe. For we cringe and shrink at the moment of realization , at the reality of psyche where there is no ego-control, especially in its ugliness or banality.\" (Lyn Cowan, \"On Masochism,\" Spring 1979, Spring Pub., 1979, p47). If you can see that the world is beautiful, but have lost the ability to feel t hat beauty, of course your moods are going to swing from sullen inertia to active despair. The ego feels out of control, and there is seemingly no meaning in life, so why exist at all? You feel fragment ed, alienated from yourself. This is the beginning of the work, and a major reason people seek therapy or a mystical path to let go for renewal. When your ego can no longer pursue only its selfis h concerns and addictive demands, the Self forces us into a depression to s hake up the stagnant order of things. It brings a burning awareness of your shortcomings and inade quacies. To get to the root of these, we need to process old traumas and negative core beliefs th at severely limit us. The Self appears on the inner stage as the shadow and confronts us with our inferior traits. Once we experientially comprehend the purposeful dynamics of the N igredo, the depression begins to lift. But in order for this happen, we must accept the black ness as our own instead of blaming it on outside situations or other people. Then we begin to discover t hat it is our own withdrawal and loss of feeling about our own shadow natures that is the sou rce of the darkness. When we turn our attention toward it, we see we are not suffering a mere per sonal ill, but one with transpersonal dimensions. In other words, this is a plight common t o all of mankind, and a milestone on the path of individuation. It is a natural part of development. [for more on shadow and nigredo, also see my Modern Alchemist ] The Nigredo in Alchemy, Path 32 The putrefactio or nigredo represents the rotting stench of decay from t he ego's outmoded attitudes and lack of adaptability. It occurs at the time in the life of the aspirant when the strain of the environment or pressure to achieve has become intolerable. In tim e, the attacked alchemist comes to realize that he must willingly subject him/her self to change. 'Raven's head' is the traditional name for the stage of the process whose tec hnical name is the nigredo. The nigredo is symbolized by multiple references to black su bstances, and is associated with the Shadow archetype, or repressed contents of the personal uncons cious. The nigredo implies a time of anxiety, melancholia, sleeplessness, and restless volatil ity. This stage of discomfort with the status quo is necessary to initiate the alchemical p rocess -- the dissatisfaction and discomfort turn up the psychic heat. Thus, we se e there is an inherent value and meaning in this depression. In our modern world of antidepressants and tranquilizers many people fail to follow this mood toward its positive goal, and despair or become doubly disappointed after the medications begin to fail on them after a time. Psychologically, we experience in this phase a chaotic state of conflict betw een hostile psychic"},{"pageNumber":1197,"pageContent":"elements. There is a tendency toward regression, helplessness, iner tia, or losing consciousness of the motivating factors of behavior. We don't want to do a thing; even rise in the m orning; what's the point!? Any emotional response to the situation is practically im possible. We are too numb, too down, too paralyzed. We don't know where to turn if we could. In modern te rms, it is equivalent to the concept of psychic dissociation, which is the root of neu rosis and psychosis (\"falling apart\"). There is always psychic suffering when we \"fall down.\" And this is li ke falling down a psychic rabbit hole, like Alice into a totally unknown, disorienting world. We fall inexorably into a psychic black hole. It is not an adventure, but an abduction into the under world of the powerful subconscious forces, and they seem to mean us ill, to torture and disempow er us, while we are helpless. This suffering may even persist for a lifetime if there i s technical blunder in the Work, a failure to respond to its spontaneous call to action. The alchemist must \"p ick him/herself back up.\" Then, there will be further transmutations from the instinc tive psyche. This stage corresponds, again, to the encounter with the Shadow. The ego and the Shadow must eventually be reconciled. The restlessness and disorientation are th e product of an initial collision between conscious and unconscious factors. This is the be ginning of a descent into darkness, or the unconscious. As long as the psyche struggles in the nigredo, it will be emotionally attached to the literal aspects of any situation. Fascinated by \"facts\" and the \"materialness\" or \" medicalness\" of any condition, the alchemist fails to extract the symbolic aspect which wou ld allow him/her to break through into a fresh mode of perception. Typical manifestations of this stage i nclude long dreams, confusion, and a drained or depressed mental attitude. The symbol ic attitude is presented when the nigredo is perceived as part of a mystery process -- a c urse with a hidden blessing, or grace at its core. Missing the point, the eye of the aspirant caught up in the nigredo looks for w hat is \"wrong.\" It ruminates on such physical questions as, \"Is it an organic or neurological probl em creating these manifestations of depression in me--is it clinical depre ssion?\" It will then propose such treatments as pills, body work, or dance therapy. Grossness casts a veil or cloak of p hysicality over the subtle body of the alchemist and he fails to realize it is his soul which is sick unto death. The \"cure\" will not come through antidepressants, tranquilizers, vit amin therapy, geographic escapes, or rejuvenating drugs and cosmetics, or exercise and endorphins. The elan vital, or life energy has been pulled into the unconscious, leaving th e ego frustrated and discontent. The emptiness and sterility of this condition may be th e result of placing too much emphasis on \"getting it together in the work-a-day world, leaving the soul cut off from the well-springs of life. The feeling of being drained, or over-extended may become so powerful that one is forced into a breakdown which demands the time for introversion and recovery of energy reserves. The ability to see through to a value in depression (to experience the mean ingfulness of the feeling of meaninglessness) has a prognosticative purpose. Attaching meanin g to depression allows an emotional participation which unblocks the flow of psychic en ergy. Depression is not a loss of meaning, but the feeling of loss of a sense of meaning. One is reminded of King Arthur during his \"wasteland\" period, wandering in the wilderness before th e finding of the Grail."},{"pageNumber":1198,"pageContent":"There we learn \"the King is the land, and the land is the King.\" And whe n it comes to the Grail to ask, \"Who do these things serve?\" Meaning comes through deepening the proc ess. \" This whole experience is like a journey through the wilderness and it oft en appears in dreams under the symbol of the \"Night-sea Journey.\" But when the problems of the per sonal unconscious have been met and dealt with in analysis, a sense of inner unity and renewal i s usually found. This is often accompanied by glimpses of deeper values, of the Self, for instance, that are frequently couched in the terms of religious symbolism. The analysant feels that he is once again reconciled with himself and with God so he can go back to this ordinary life with renewed zest . The wilderness is no longer barren, his life blossoms and bears fruit.\" (M. Esther Harding, \"The Value and Meaning of Depression,\" Bulletin for the APC of NY; Analytical Psychology C lub of NY, Inc., 1970; p. 10.) Path 32, connecting Malkuth with Yesod, the Sphere of the Moon (correspond ing with dreams), can be the path of renewal which transmutes the alchemist from his s ense of confusion and despair. \" Following this state of darkness, the alchemists report that light begins to daw n, due to the rising moon, which psychologically means the beginning of insight gained through payin g attention to the unconscious, to the night happenings, to dreams and so on, which throw a light on one's inner condition. The moon also refers to Eros, relatedness through feeling. In oth er words, when the nigredo, the blackness, has been accepted and taken to oneself, instead of being blamed on outs ide situations and other people, one begins to see that it is one's own withdrawal and los s of feeling one's own shadow, that is the true cause of darkness. Then the moon rises and in recognizing that one is suffering... that is the feminine eros; the lesser light begins t o shine in the darkness of the night. \" (Harding, 1970). That moonrise in Qabalistic terms, means access now to the sphere of Yesod , the Moon. The stuckness is over, though other bouts with depression may bring further growth and insight on a higher arc. Further alchemical transmutation will bring one into the w armth of the sun, the greater light, which means there is an increase in the light of conscious ness (Tiphareth stage). Thus one traverses astral world or the mystical realms of the Sun (Tiphare th), the Moon (Yesod) and Stars (The Universe). \"And so one meaning of the experience of depression is that our wholeness, or i ndividuation, the Self, can no longer wait while we follow egotistic ways or even seek for legit imate ego fulfillment, and so the Self brings us, drives us, into the wilderness of depression...and commu nication between earth and heaven is even then about to be revealed to us, if only we will attend to th e vision.\" (Harding, 1970). It is an experiential journey, this experiment on oneself with the el ements of nature. To really \"get it\" we must do the work to get the benefit. The method works if we d o. At this stage we can greatly benefit from watching and participating in our imagery process by en tering the stream of consciousness, the dreamtime. Dreamhealing, a form of shamanic dream j ourneys, also known as CRP (Consciousness Restructuring Process) can be very hel pful in this process of letting go and connecting with source, with flow and the well-spring of life.

Through Virtual Reality (VR) we can create an electronic representation of typical symbols of the psyche and interact with them. Even though these images have no concrete existence, they are influential in the process of transformation. The practice of magick, a sacred technology, normally involves concentrated visualization activity coupled with immersion in the autonomous stream of consciousness. Since much of the training and practice in magick is b ased on a recipe, formula, or protocol, these could easily be programmed, using virtual re ality, to guide an aspirant into a specific state of consciousness. Biofeedback m onitoring could enhance that state. * Each virtual world would include a panoply of symbols related to a specifi c archetype. The aspirant would journey through this world. In the process of p ositive interaction with these archetypal forms (or perhaps imaginally becoming th em), the psyche becomes \"inoculated\" with their resources. A conscious relat ionship is fostered. This leads to a greater sense of wholeness and communion with transpersonal energies. Through the arrival of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, we will soon have acce ss to a fully programmable electronic \"astral plane.\" Magic has always been a sacred technology, and combining it with VR makes for a state-of-the-art practice. In virtual reality, we can create a world which is, in essence or effect, \"as good as \" normal reality. Through the use of visual, audial, kinesthetic, and olfactory feedback, the experiential (rather than analytical) part of the brain is gu ided to suspend its disbelief in the synthetic reality. The realization of a system of interactive fantasy will allow us, as artists or magicians, to shape the experience from the inside. It will allow us to re-shape ourselves, also. A central premise in VR is that you can manipulate your self- representation, or self-image. VR represents a cultural revolution i n the way we view reality, nature, art, ourselves, and our relationship with transpersonal powers."},{"pageNumber":1201,"pageContent":"Interactive media will give us the ability to author moving images. When you can put your images in cyberspace, you introduce your own unique content into the experience. Background, or natural imagery, will be texture-mapped for ambi guity. Ambiguity is one key to the engagement of the imagination (Laurel, 1992). Communal virtual reality is also possible for group rituals, but requires a tremendously powerful computer to keep track of all the details w hich perpetuate a believable virtual space. The realm of imagination has traditionally been the province of shamans and magicians. More recently, psychotherapists have entered the arena of imagin ation as guides to the heights and the depths. There are many different style s in the practice of magic from primitive to sophisticated. Magic is the ancien t technology for dealing with lost or questing souls, while archetypal psychology is a mod ern counterpart. Basically, there are three ways of encountering the inner world, reflect ing the state ofconsciousness of the practitioner: 1). prototaxic mode, a \"possession\" or trance state where the ego is absent through regression; 2). parataxic mode, whic h includes art, archetype, myth, dream, and ritual wherein the ego is enthralled; and 3). syntaxic mode, which includes creativity, gnosis, and higher mystical states , where the ego is enraptured and eventually transcended. Sophisticated magick, or Theurgy, has been practiced in western occultis m through the centuries largely by an elite group of eccentric intellectuals. Man y of them identified with the Rosicrucians, Masons, Gnostics, or other \"hidden \" orders. These practitioners of the mystic arts were the forefathers of modern scie nces like chemistry, botany, medicine, physics, astronomy, and philosophy. Through magick, they learned a unique way of looking at the inner and outer world. This is the m ajor premise of any philosophy: \"Look at it like this...\" The magical philosophy has left a tremendous legacy. The history of these alchemists, mystics, healers, and th eurgists outlines one of the most interesting areas of human endeavor: consciousnes s studies. The mapping of consciousness states and their corresponding typical expe riences (plus how to attain them) forms part of the doctrine of any magical philosophy. Th e most widely embraced map is called The Tree of Life. The very foundation of t he modern western occult tradition is contained in this circuit or glyph of The Tree of Life. It describes a hierarchy of 10 states of being (Spheres), and 22 character istic modes of transition between them (Paths). All the corresponding symb olism of the human psyche is categorized according to this comprehensive basic stru cture. It represents all ways of being and becoming--all possible states of conscious ness. The philosophical system which the Tree represents originated in the Jewish culture. Through synchronism it amalgamated with the Gnostic, Egyptian, A rabic, and other systems. This synthesis became known as Hermetic Qabalism. In divorcing itself from its Hebrew roots, Qabala returned to the mythic domain of its informing archetype, Hermes."},{"pageNumber":1202,"pageContent":"In ancient Egypt, this archetypal energy was represented by the god Thoth, Lor d of Magic. He presided over skills such as writing and translating. In Greec e, as Hermes, he was the messenger between the realm of the gods and men--he who could fly into the heights or depths. Our modern forms of writing and trans lating have moved into information processing via computers. Information processing i s fundamental to any form of communication. Information processing is the foundation of all technology. Thus, Hermes is the informing myth of a technological approach to sacred psychology and spirituality. Hermes' domain includes gnosticism, alchemy, magick, and depth psychology. Like programming, they are all hermeneutic endeavors, involving the process of interpretation. Jung noticed that, \"Every interpretation necessarily remains an \"as- if.\" The ultimate core of meaning may be circumscribed, but not described .\" He refers to the \" as-if \" reality as the closest we can come to direct knowledge. For example, our God-image in the psyche is our closest (and only) experience of Divinity, however unique it may be. We perceive it directly, but it is a specific in terpretation of the unknowable archetype. MYTHICAL REALISM: Ultimately, it is our sense organs which help us interpret the world an d our experience through our perceptions. They help us make a distinction be tween what is \"real\" and \"unreal.\" The emotional part of the brain, (the right, spati al lobe), cannot analytically distinguish a symbol from a symbolic representation. In imagination or virtual realityit becomes a moot point. Fantasy, in fact, animates both our inner and outer worlds, and creates meaning. The on-going imaginative process of the psyche is the ground of being. Jung spoke of the psychoid aspec t of psyche as the vast non-human action of the universal forces. Through the technology of virtual reality, we can take the imagery arising from deep within our psyche and create an \"as-if\" reality which we can ente r at will. If magick is the art and science of changing consciousness at will, in this con text, imagination is reality. It manifests as images. Jung implied that our closest approach to God or any minor deity is through the God-image. This brings to mind the process of invocation, or calling in the god-form in magick. The conjuring of these archetypal images, and identification or interaction with them is a primary application of ritual in theurgy. In magick, it is taken virtually literally, as m agician Dion Fortune's comment shows: ...the Ministrant proceeds boldly with the ceremony as if that which he ha d invoked had actually come about...He must have the courage of his convictions, and give himself up boldly to be the instrument of the forces he has invoked, relying upon them to bring about the transition from fantasy to fact, which is the meaning of transubstantiation. If he proceeds to play the part he has assigned himself as if i t were a reality, he will find, provided the force he has invoked is a genuine force and the pictorial image he has made is a suitable one, that imagination has become reality an d"},{"pageNumber":1203,"pageContent":"that an influence is flowing into him, and emanating from him, which i s a very real thing indeed... Since archetypal images arise from the collective unconscious, they are c ommon to all mankind. The God-forms invoked in magick are the basis of our psychic life and our relationship to the universe. Everything we are is virtually imagined thr ough their forces and forms. There is nothing but their primary essence to b e found in either our concrete or imaginal reality, if psyche is the foundation of reali ty. Magic and archetypal psychology allege this is so. Jung advocated the practice of Active Imagination for transformation. He based hi s technique on the alchemical meditatio, or dialogic exchange with the trans personal. It involves entering the autonomous stream of psychic imagery with the value s, ethics, and perspective of the ego, and interacting therein. Magick propose s a very similar premise, but has an entire technology for clearing out a purified ps ychic \"space\" into which an undiluted primal force may be called forth. B oth techniques share the same result: a consciousness journey with real-time eff ects. Imagination is reality when it has the power to move us biologically, kinesthetically, vis cerally, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. The prospect of \"home-brewed\" imaginal worlds for exploration and recreati on is on the horizon before the turn of the millennium. Those pursuing the age- old Quest or Great Work will certainly want to put this possibility to purposeful use. When a person becomes caught up in a ritual, visualization, or meditation, inner v s. outer becomes a moot point. Imagination becomes a spontaneous influence which can be \"seen\" through the Observer Self. Magick is the directing of that experi ence in a specific direction, to a particular focus. Each ritual has its own telos, or goal . It is this striving, goal-oriented attitude of the ego that makes magick a heroic que st. We may speculate that similating archetypal forms in VR gives their transp ersonal energy a \"body\" to inhabit, just as visualizing does. Chronicity (the propensi ty for archetypal forms and events to cyclically recur) and synchronicity (acausal connection) provide magically-charged energy for the simulated forms. Al l perceptions of archetypes are simulations of their unknowable primal n ature, anyway. This holds true in mystical experience, art, and imagination. Accordin g to Jung, archetypes are everywhere, so they will certainly be found in virtual re ality, alive and well. In this form, they will be more accessible than ever. Th e novice could easily get a first-hand training experience in what inner dialogue is like . Archetypes will be just as inclined to inhabit or inform these virtual images as any other. In fact, there is no way around it, if the programs are consistent and coherent. With an artificial intelligence program added, they will behave with a certain degree of spontaneity and novelty, congruent with their character. V R conjures them, evokes them, or calls them up into awareness for interact ion. The imaginal character speaks and behaves in its characteristic manner, bu t reacts uniquely in each specific situation. The entire panoply of symbolic corr espondences, for which the god-form is the nexus, could be displayed interactively for t he aspirant."},{"pageNumber":1204,"pageContent":"In the magical operation known as assumption of the god-form, the participant identifies with the archetypal power. In VR, the aspirant could experi ence being decked out in full regalia, with all the symbolic appurtenances, in an envi ronment and atmosphere exclusively geared to expressing that power. To role-play the characteristic utterances and acts of that god or goddess could be a further amplification of the process. Mythic journeys, programmed by master magic ians, will be available like the electronic games of today. It could be used for accessing and anchoring transpersonal resources for the personality. VIRTUAL BODIES OF LIGHT: A major tenet of Qabala and occult philosophy concerns the nature of the astral body. The Jews call it the Tselem. This starry body is composed of scintillat ing etheric energy. It is perceived in imagination as being composed of light t hat takes on various fine forms. The analogy with electrical energy and light in cybersp ace is obvious, if not literal. To work on the astral level, the magician identifies with this virtual dou ble of the physical body. In imagination, one perceives with the eyes of the body of light w hile maintaining its perspective and orientation. The light body has the ability of separating itself from the constraints of the flesh and blood body, with out limitations of a mortal frame. The astral body contains the fully functioning consciousness of the aspi rant. Its existence is alleged to persist after physical death, as reported by those w ith near- death-experiences. Magically, or psychically, the astral body is built in th e imagination through the process of breath control, or pranayama. The VR program supercedes the trained imaginative faculty. It opens the experience to those who are not of contemplative nature, those unwilling or unable to spend years traini ng the mind and visualization capacity. It makes the dialogic realm open to all in limi ted form. It establishes a new medium for the traditional I-Thou dialogue . The virtual astral body could be employed for the practice of pathworking. Magic k, itself, is the practice of practical Qabala, and its most practical exploit s are the imaginal consciousness journeys known as pathworking. As a magical practice, pathworking differs from ceremonial invocation by imaginally transporting t he aspirant to the location of an archetypal Form, rather than calling the Form into t he circle or oneself. The experience includes a \"there-and-back-again\" experience of a very specially conditioned terrain. The exposure to symbols keys processes in the mind which influence the process of transformation. The paths of The Tree of Life are metaphorical \"in-roads\" through the i magination. Each is marked by typical landmarks, milestones, and signposts. Each contai n their ordeals, challenges, and intrinsic rewards. Pathworking offers a way of \"fin ding\" or \"locating\" archetypes in imaginal space. In imagination, we do it simply by wish ing ourselves there, actively interacting. In VR, it requires some programmi ng, but the"},{"pageNumber":1205,"pageContent":"initial intent is the same whether creating your own program or authorin g a master program for others. Each successive pathworking increases the area of perceptible inne r space. One can enter the experience as a passive spectator, or as an active participant. Th e emotional impact of the experience is real. Imagine when these experien ces become re-processed in your dream life! In VR, other humans could play the parts of entities encountered, or the journey may be undertaken as a common advent ure. All pathworkings return the traveller to the point of origin, which is usu ally some symbolic form of door to the netherworld. Another magical exercise, rising on the planes, is conducted while in the Body of Light. In this process, one imagines oneself moving further and furthe r up through the hierarchy of planes described in the Qabala. You can get a sense for it if you can imagine an ever-widening perspective moving from sub-atomic to cosmic . For example, imagine you are a sub-atomic particle, an atom, a molecule, an organism, an animal, a human, the biosphere, the earth, the solar system, the galaxy, ad infinitum. All of this type of imagery is readily programmable and universal in meaning. VIRTUAL SEX MAGICK: When people hear of VR, one of the first application that leaps to mind is the possibility of virtual sex. Extending that idea into magical realism we come ac ross the notion of virtual sex magick. Virtual sex magick awaits the development of tactile feedback systems. However, the act itself is a generator for surplu s magical energy which may therefore be focused on a specific desire or intent. Thi s is known as the \"bud will\" or \"magickal child.\" It uses the emotional energy of enf lamment coupled with the directive powers of will, visualization, and intention ality. Perhaps the most commonly recommended application of sex magick is for at taining \"knowledge and conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel.\" While this wasn 't meant as \"knowledge\" in the Biblical sense, it is certainly a possibili ty in VR. The consummation of the act means either identification with, or dialogic int eraction with the higher self. Most acts of sacred sex reenact the holy union (hie rosgamos) of God and Goddess, Shiva and Shakti, Krisna and Radha, Yang and Yin forces. It is a cosmic union of complements. Here again is fertile ground for the programm ing of a VR reality to enhance the imaginative faculty. Imaginal variations on the mystic marriage could use images of mythical and historical figures or draw from the symbolism of Tantra, alchemy, and Taoism, to name a few. One might perceive the experience from the perspectiv e of a particular god or goddess in a classical union. Each program might contain one or many experiences of a similar nature. The menu might include the union of God and the Shekinah, God and Sophia, spirit and nature, anima/animus, priest/pries tess, or"},{"pageNumber":1206,"pageContent":"King and Queen. One time you might be Solomon and Sheba, another Ares and Aphrodite, another Arthur and Guinevere. The Royal Marriage is a transcendent symbol of the Self, and embodies psych ic totality. With plasticity of form and interaction we can only speculate what hermaphroditic creations might result, what androgynous beings. These experiencesmight not represent their mature psychological counte rparts, but they could be inspiring dress-rehearsals, which jump-start the creat ive imagination, adding a new dimension to sexual life--sort of the reverse of pornography. Normally, we are not taught to direct our thoughts into any higher purpose duri ng sex, much less at the point of orgasm. Yet, to do so can be healing and connective in a very deep way. VR could serve as a model and demonstration far beyond any orthodox sexual therapy. Interactive fantasy could be raised to new heights. Thi s technology could teach us new ways to relate to our bodies, sexuality, and art (including the art of magick). Virtual tantra is a new medium in the sexu al arena. Another VR alternative for sex magick is to engage in actual sex with one's partn er. Both parties have VR helmets (much reduced in size from current cu mbersome models) which allow the simultaneous visualization of the \"bud will,\" the \"magickal child,\" or goal of the operation. This dynamic image is the focus of the lovers wh o invest it with their mutual energy and love to transform it from mere pot ential into a vital force for change in the real world. VR insures that both parties visuali zations are identical as possible. The moment just prior to orgasm is a very open, suggestible state. For some it i s difficult to hold the magickal focus at that moment. Passive impregnati on by the VR system (based on the aspirant's desires) could be readily accomplishe d at that point with suitable imagery. It could be a non-literal, yet post-symbolic way of conce iving an inner, spiritual \"child\" through ritual--the embryonic form of the greater self. Countless variations on magical talismans and mandalas might constitute part of the programming, as well as explosive imagery of cosmic union. For the Royal Wedding to be truly consummated, insights must be applied in practice. For it to fully work its magic, it requires a prior marriage of Anima and Animus with in each aspirant. This is a form of \"spiritual body\" building. VIRTUAL THERAPY:"},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"SPECULATIONS ON A NEW MODALITY by Iona Miller and Burt Webb, c1992 ABSTRACT: The advent of virtual reality technology opens up a whole new dimension for therapy. Psychotherapist and client may enter an electroni c simulation which allows them both to occupy a shared imaginal space. The parameters of the system and environment can be programmed to display specific archetypal imagery which is known to influence the deep psyc he. The ability to interact with the system provides a means of intervention and transformation. The therapist, as electronic shaman, either guides or follows the clien t's process. He chooses from a repertoire of archetypal encounters those imag es which fit most closely, thus amplifying the \"cybernaut's\" imagery experience. Distinctions of inner vs. outer become experientially moo t. Therapeutic interventions, impossible in consensus reality, becom e readily available without standard ethical considerations. The shaman's flight into the netherworld to retrieve a \"lost\" soul becom es a literal reality experienced as a co-conscious journey. The discernment and non-directive attitude of the therapist insures that the client w ill not be traumatized. The perception of universal and personal metaphors is enhanced and amplified, rather than imposed. As in hypnosis, the client maintains the possibility of \"escape\" back into consensus reality, sim ply by closing their eyes. "},{"pageNumber":1208,"pageContent":"VIRTUAL REALITY Virtual Reality (VR) is one step beyond computer visualization. Through VR, w e can actually \"climb into\" a synthetic visual and aural environment, or simulate d \"reality\", and experience visceral responses to that world. Mankind has al ways used symbols, imagery, and metaphor to facilitate changes in consciousness. This is traditionally the realm of the shaman, magician, and more recently, the psychotherapist. In this era of seemingly magical technologies, we may combi ne both technology and technique for exploring the imagination to create a new modality. \"Magician/therapist\" is the informing myth of VR Therapy. Since VR technology already exists, we should consider its application to communication and therapeutic interactions. \"Virtual\" means to have th e same effect but not the substance of physical reality. In terms of psychological impact, virtual reality may be \"as good as\" or even better than physical reality. This technology allows us to create whole universes at our fingertips to improvise \"realities\". Synthetic realities are created by generating synthetic visual, audible, olfactory, kinesthetic, and/or tactile input. The 3D effect, scenery altering in r elation to the roving point of vision, is created by showing slightly different views to eac h eye. Bob Jacobson describes the universe inside cyberspace. A \"virtual world\" is a unique, intangible but highly designed informatio n environment generated by a computer and transmitted by \"virtual interface\" technology to a user who \"enters\" the virtual world via appropriate sensory mechanisms. The virtual world environment can be as complex as a three dimensional \"sense surround\" comprising seamless visual, aural, and tact ile cues; or as simple as a computer conferencing system. Virtual Reality simulations seem so real because the right hemisphere of the brain makes no distinction between symbols and the symbolic reality they repre sent. Hypnosis, used to by-pass the critical mind, could be very effective in creating an enhanced sense of \"reality.\" This suspension of disbelief is why exp eriential psychotherapies work. Through the manipulation or transformation of symbols , the emotional brain can experience changes as real as those induced through the external environment. In Virtual Reality, the map is the territory, even though we may keep reminding ourselves it is still representative of the deeper layers of the psyche . In Virtual Reality, it is axiomatic that \"imagination is reality.\" The possibilities are endless, just as they are in dreams. The participants engagement in the scenario is immediate, and compelling. The seemingly impossible becomes permiss ible. In VR you do not necessarily even have to have a body anymore. Or, you could chose an option and become an animal, or even an inanimate object. This could be therapeutic if it broadens awareness. Consciousness, or the sense of bei ng, is liberated from the constraints of normal time and space."},{"pageNumber":1209,"pageContent":"In the near future, perhaps the best metaphor for the Virtual Reality e xperience is that of a vehicle. While both parties are seated in comfortable chairs, thei r two points of view will be able to \"fly\" through a computer generated space . Emphasis here is on the visual and auditory modes. These sensory inputs constitute ab out is 97% of our information absorption, so this combination can be very powerful. For therapeutic purposes, the program can draw on cross cultural symbols of transformation. In the mid term, it will be possible to move around in a space with some tac tile feedback that will allow the therapist and client to interact with co mputer \"objects\". Emphasis here would be on adding physical mobility in a comple x space and interaction with small objects to the visual and auditory modes. This wil l permit participation in physical activities such as \"rituals\" including \"magi cal implements.\" Farther in the future, it will be possible to interface directly wi th the brain and realistically simulate \"reality.\" Actual motor activity will be prevent ed by activating the same brain stem block which prevents actual movement during dre ams. All senses receive congruent input and virtually all types of experiences b ecome possible. In order for a clinical system to be practical, one of the critical elemen ts will be an \"authoring system\". This will be a computer program that a non computer graph ic specialist will be able to use to construct \"worlds\" and interactive sc enarios. It will be highly interactive and should contain generic settings, human forms, obje cts, textures, etc. Initially, it might be sort of a three dimensional \"cut and p aste\" system of elements. The design system should be readily understandable to the therapist in terms of visual \"primitives\" which would include archetypal forms. During actual excursions into \"therapy space\", the therapist would contr ol the \"world\" with some sort of hand tool. Current work is focusing on a sort of wan d which would give the user immediate control over the visual elements in the space. It will function like a sort of super \"mouse,\" or \"scepter of power.\" Biofeedback would be very useful for registering the reactions of the c lient to the different elements and experiences in the therapeutic space. P reliminary set up for a particular client might consist of running through pictures of set tings, objects, people, etc. which might have significance for the client. The results of the survey would then be used to program the visual experience in the therapeutic scenario. The therapist could see the space differently than the client. For i nstance, the gaze of the client could be tracked and the therapist would see a set of cross hai rs where ever the client was looking. A colored graphic display of biofeedback infor mation on the client could float in the air next to the cross hairs. Virtual Reality Therapy is not prescriptive.

Virtu al Therapy is a shared journey, which can either be pre programmed much like guided visualiz ation, or an extemporaneous \"guided dance\" provided by the therapist who follows th e client's emergent response. The psyche employs metaphor as an encrypting system for storing and retrievi ng many kinds of information. Root metaphors are cross cultural, part of our collect ive heritage, and sometimes transpersonal. We become aware of these archetypal patterns in our life through our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual interaction with the outer and inner world. Some experience, especi ally (pre verbal) trauma, becomes stored as epistemological metaphors. When these are de code d in experiential process-oriented therapy, they reveal what the experien ce was like. They form the foundation for \"how we know what we know\" about our experie nce and perception. Metaphors, like imagery, are subject to transmutation and transformation. T hey have been widely employed in therapy for a wide variety of purposes. Root metaphors lie at the basis of a person's self image, who and what they perceive themselves to be. In therapy, when we change the metaphor the attitudes, feelings, beliefs, and injunctions of the client are modified automatically. An e xcursion into chaos and consciousness in the electronic dreamtime could certainly b e influential if guided properly. EXPERIENTIAL THERAPY There are two basic approaches to the use of metaphor in therapy. The first i s a \"canned\" approach, which assumes a beneficial effect from certain imag ery or stories for certain types of problems. Ericksonian hypnosis uses the \"im ported\" metaphor for a wide range of diagnoses. The stories relate to the dysfunctions of the client and show a route to healing as a possibility and model. The treatment is essentially pre-determined and applied in a \"one size fits all\" m anner. In process-oriented therapy, the metaphors emerge from the client , rather than being imported by the therapist as a quick fix. In process work, the ther apist does not assume to have any pre-packaged means of healing the client. Rather, the metaphor and meaning emerge organically from within the client, and the the rapist merely guides and fosters that emergence. By merely \"trusting the proce ss\", they arrive at a unique, creative solution. Epistemological metaphors are idiosyncr atic for each person, and are the key to individualized therapy. Their experience is encoded in their personal symbols. Through the amplification and elaboration of root metaphors and epistemologic al metaphors, VR offers a means of enhancing many therapeutic processes which employ imagination. VR applications could be developed for Transactional Analysis, Gestalt, Transpersonal, and Jungian therapies. Many of the stock-in-t rade techniques of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) could also be employe d. In VR,"},{"pageNumber":1211,"pageContent":"one could experience even more vividly the \" part's party \" of conflicting subpersonalities, the \" change history, \" or the process of \" re-framing .\" VR could be used for simple hypnotic regressions, phobia desensiti zation, re- parenting, the Gestalt two chair technique, or dialogue with figures li ke the shadow, anima/animus, or wise self. Psychodrama scenarios with role playing and other players could be useful. The other players could be human beings sharing i n the therapy space, or computer generated images under the control of the the rapist. For example, in re-parenting, the therapist could create an imaginal care -giver based on the client's ideal description, or use the client's adult se lf as the model. The client may be regressed, even to infancy or womb experience, to feel visce rally the nurturing and positive support which were unavailable historically. T he new \"memory\" of responsive nourishing does not change the historical fact, but supercedes it in meaning. The greater the need, the deeper the impa ct. In simulating subjective reality, VR provides a wider range of imaginal scen arios than traditional therapy with its ethical constraints. Some pioneers in r e-parenting were highly criticized for their physical interaction with clients . One example was a therapist who actually breast fed her schizophrenic clients durin g spontaneous regressions, so that they could internalize that warmth and mature from the most fundamental stages of development. Clearly this crosses the ethical li ne. However, in VR the therapist has a host of resources available which do not create depe ndency issues, or violations of physical parameters. Another alternative is that the client creates his own world and mani pulates figures within it, as in sandtray therapy. The story unfolds from the client and is externalized in VR. The therapist can look on or guide. The client can choose to \"climb into\" his waking dream and participate, or not. One could identif y experientially with any character or object. The high tech shaman/therapist may employ VR to supercharge the therapy process. However, this turbocharged therapy would not be indicated for mos t sessions. It should be interspersed with traditional sessions. In t his way, Virtual Therapy does not become a substitution of symbolic realities for the worl d. Contraindications would be fairly self-evident. The same criteria app ly to Virtual Therapy as those for determining any therapy of choice for each client. It migh t be fine for a systematic desensitization, and sensory overload for a fixed delusi on. VR can be used as a psychological training environment. The experiences are n ot only simulations, they are virtually real. They are true experiences on the e motional level. VR can be used to enhance our inborn perception and reaction capacit ies. With the subject isolated from sensory contact with consensus realit y, all input comes from the totally fabricated environment. Client and therapist can open a door into any reality or fantasy they choose, for therapeutic purposes. In the VR environment, we have the means of extending the capacities of both the body and psyche. Symbols and imagery can be used in either an \"innoculatory\" or"},{"pageNumber":1212,"pageContent":"corrective manner for balancing the personality. Paradoxically, they can be u sed for fostering a strong coping ego, or dissolving the rigidities of a personality through \"ego death.\" The dissolving of the outworn, defective personality and the emer gence of a new self in a safe environment, under controlled conditions has its m odel in the ancient psychological prescription of alchemy: \" Solve et coagula .\" Descriptions of this spontaneous process are found in many cultures. O ne classical example is the Tibetan Book of the Dead , which describes specific Bardo states, or states of consciousness, which emerge during the psychological rebirth process. The varieties of psychological rebirth are many. They generally involve rising anxiety on the part of the ego undergoing the experience. The fear comes from dissolvi ng the primary identification with ego as the only means of experiencing Self. The ego must pass through and beyond the fear, pain, and chaos which invariably lie on the path to inner healing. Typically, after this phase, there is an emer gence into the transpersonal realm, where new resources are found, which can be brought back from the experience and integrated. In the modern era, similar expe riences were reported in the field of consciousness studies, using psyched elic substances in a therapeutic manner. Most of the parameters of this experience could b e simulated in VR Therapy without the use of drugs. In this quickly evolving field, there are certain developments which would mark greater degrees of freedom within the therapeutic setting. Right now wi th simple computer conferencing, it is possible for a therapist at point A to inter face with a client at a remote location. With a video interface, the nuances of personal observation are not lost. However, there is a definite perception of \"remote ness\" in the exchange. The creation of a more tangible common meeting ground in cyberspace or a virtual world, overcomes this initial problem. However, it raises the practical problem of both parties having interfacing gear at their respective locations. Current state of the art involves cumbersome goggles and other apparatus like gloves or joysticks. All this gear is attached to the computer by cables required for power and information flow. Even if both therapist and client were in the same l ocation, merely dressing in this gear creates an initial barrier between them. The current generation of commercially available helmets deliver a low resol ution image with a limited field of vision and a slow refresh rate. The complexi ty of the computer generated world is limited with respect to the number an d complexity of objects, visual detail, movement, etc. There may be an appreciable time lag be tween head movement and image response. Tactile feedback is limited to the expe rience of sensations of texture and light pressure on the finger tips. Force feedback utilizes special hand devices which duplicate th e resistances experienced during movement of an small object under the influence of external forces. More sophisticated force feedback with complexly shaped objec ts with mass and forces acting on the whole body are under development but are complex and expensive. Creating the illusion of real solid objects would facilitate the therapy"},{"pageNumber":1213,"pageContent":"process, even though 97% of human sensory processing normally occurs through sight and sound. According to Webb, \"whole body suits have been created which sense the position and movement of the user's body and generate a 'computer simulacrum.' This all ows the participant to view his own body and it also permits two or more people to see each other and interact. The amount of information needed to track position in space i s very small, so it would be simple to use ordinary phone lines to communicate betwee n users in two different locations who would appear to be in the same space.\" The body suits from VPL are complex and involve a number of different sensor systems for different types of movement. They have to be individually fitt ed, which is time consuming and expensive. Current data transfer systems inhib it movement. The person wearing the suit has to have a thick cable physically connected to t he computers. Ideally, there should be some sort of wireless link to the com puters so the individual would be free to move around in a controlled space. Unlik e conventional therapies, many potential applications of VR do not require the presence of more than one person. This raises the question of self-administered therapeutic inter actions where the computer program itself actually guides the experience. Many of the same i ssues come up that arise with self administration of psychotropic drugs. Again, acc ording to Webb, \" the function of psychotropic drugs is to introduce a new state of consciousness into the brain without regard to specific information cont ent. VR is a new way to introduce specific information content into the brain witho ut a specific state of consciousness. While the presentation of visual and aural informati on can certainly result in an altered state of consciousness, VR and psychedeli cs are really profoundly different.\" That having been said, the potential for VR to be used to alter consciousn ess is vast. It could exert an incredible control over states of consciousness for ei ther beneficial or harmful effects. The results could be as trivial as temporary alteration of mood or as profound as a radical alteration of personality. These changes could be voluntary or imposed from the outside. The capability of VR to either liberat e or control the mind really needs to be explored and understood. Artificial intelligence programs are being developed which can form a mod el of the user including an estimation of the user's belief system. Work is bein g done on the reading and interpretation of emotional states via facial expressions, gest ures, voice tone and inflection, word choice, statements and even biophysical variables. S uch a system could spontaneously change a virtual world based on the actions and reactions of a user. VR is not immune to the possibility of abuse. Much like video games have be come a form of addiction which limits the availability of the individual for real li fe experience, VR has an escapist, addictive potential, because it could conc eivably even create pleasure or ecstasy states on demand. In a therapeutic situat ion, theoretically the therapist is in control of the parameters of the exper ience. The"},{"pageNumber":1214,"pageContent":"reality of VR will probably include self-administration or direction f or a variety of goals, including the possibility of virtual sex. When sophisticated control languages are designed which permit the indi vidual to have real time control over the design of the virtual world, there will be a r eal possibility of the projection of internal psychological instabilities in to the virtual world, creating dangerous feedback and feedforward loops. There is also the question of involuntary immersion in a virtual reality designed to disorien t and torment. In the information age, not all computer use is benign. Most discussions of virtual reality assume that the virtual world will be constructed explicitly by the human operator. However, the computer could use fractal mathematics to construct a realistic landscape complete with plan t life. There are a number of systems under development for creating artificial mobile li fe forms as well. The computer could generate a complex ecosystem without human intervention, which could be explored as if it were a newly discovered c ontinent. A typical hypnotic technique is for the client to create their own spe cial place. This island of serenity, or sanctuary, could be explicitly programmed to suit ind ividual desires and creativity. The juxtaposition of favorite elements would be possible, even if they are widely separated in the normal world. These \"sacred spaces\" wo uld serve as havens of refuge, and also provide spiritual nourishment. The concept of temenos , an enclosed precinct, is relevant here. The customized cyberspace can function as a cocoon for the process of transformation or metamorphosis. These VR experiences also offer the possibility of safe adventures wh ich could be used, not only to relieve stress and anxiety, but to promote self-confidence and self- esteem. They would function as a psychological training ground, because the re are real experiential consequences of immersion in cyberspace. The emotio nal changes could be profound, including the spiritual insight that our consens us reality is highly conditioned by the nature of our perceptions. We experience an image synth esized by our visual and neural systems triggered by stimulus from the physical universe. Our relationship with and attitudes toward physical reality may be prof oundly altered by our development of VR. Specific symbols could be introduced into this \"brave new world.\" This could provide a backdrop for creating state-specific alternities. Therapy cou ld draw its cue from the ancient magical practice of pathworking. Magic or Hermetic sc ience was the closest ancient art to psychology. It preceded psychology in much the sam e way that alchemy preceded chemistry. In pathworking, the aspirant \"journeys \" to the imaginal location of an archetypal Form, and returns by the same route. Jung alleged that archetypes can be found everywhere, the universal embodied i n the specific. In cyberspace, archetypes could be presented in a more abstra ct, fundamental and profound manner as \"pure\" ideal forms. Such consciousness journeys have a transformative effect.

It could be used to prepare a client for more spontaneous inte raction in the inner realm of mind. These experiences produce tangible outer effects on the behavior, body, emotions, and thoughts of the cybernaut. In Jungian psychology, it is known that certain symbols cluster together. T hey seem to share a common nature, an affinity, or to have a natural sort of correspondence. Many of these correspondences are chronicled or codified in the lore of t he occult, myth, and folklore. The image of a god or goddess presides over the entire clust er of related symbols. Thus the god Apollo is associated with the astrological forc e of the sun, the color gold, healing and certain specific scents, colors, sounds, even ts, plants and animals. Synthetic \"gods\" could be created by artificial intelligence programs to populate a virtual world. They would be capable of engaging in conversations with VR participants. Like cures like in psychosomatic relationships to dis-ease. Jung said t here are gods within our diseases. That energy can be transformed from a dysfunctional for m to a transpersonal resource. It requires building a conscious relationshi p with the primary archetypal force. Jung encouraged a kind of meditative dialogue he calle d active imagination. It was patterned after an old alchemical procedure. In acti ve imagination the ego actively engages the flow of imagination directly as a willing participant. We can immerse ourselves in the living stream of consciousness and inte ract with that spontaneously creative imagination. VR could enhance this percepti on, eliminating years of training to develop visualization skill. It is not pre programmed, nor introjected from the therapist. Traditionally, pathworking is a mediating act which occurs in imagination. The imaginal world is known to psychologists as the realm of the psyche, or soul. Pathworking and VR could be used to gain access to specific resources and qu alities associated with the archetypal symbol clusters. During the excursion, the participant enters as his ego-oriented self, complete with its values and goals. This is not idle daydreaming nor self-gratifying fantasy. The subject maintains this perspective even while exposed to and inf luenced by the evocative power of the archetype. Unlike a dream, there is the possibilit y of exercising intent and choice, as both the conscious and sub-conscious wor k together in a way that may never have been experienced before. The symbols create an atmosphere which permits the development of a direct relationship o f the ego with the transpersonal force. This spiritual application of VR creates direct experience of personal and transpersonal interaction. The I-Thou relationship is made manifest in a non physical reality. The experience is unique for each individual in both c ontent and meaning."},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"We foresee the time when we will be able to dispense with the clums y goggles and gloves and tap directly into the human brain. This would allow the creation of all the sensory and motor experiences of the \"real\" world. It is the ultimate goal of virtual evolution. Because the sensory systems are not passive detectors, b ut active processing subsystems, it would require the creation of active comput er analogs of the sensory apparatus that could interact with the brain in the same way. It may become almost impossible to distinguish Virtual Reality from Re ality Proper! This raises an obvious ethical concern. If we succeed in creati ng a computer \"dream time\", it will have a profound impact upon our sense of personal i dentity and reality. Many options will be explored because of strong psychological, social, and economic demands, regardless of any individual researcher's opinions . When The Whole Earth Review (Winter 1987) covered the VR revolution, they made an important point: We can interpret a new tool as we would a dream, for what it tells us about the psyche of its creator. For with all their ostensibly practical aims, tools are also displays of fantasy, tangible metaphors poems. They are the stories we tell ourselves about who we think we are, or wish to be. And the scary thing is that they help these stories to come true. The word \"technology\" is derived from the Greek \"techne\" which means \" the manner of accomplishing a task\". This is also the root of the word \"technique\". As the quote implies, technology originates in the mind; without the conc ept of hammering, a hammer is just a strangely shaped piece of metal on a round piece of wood. In the world of VR, man literally gets to play God, at least for a local universe. WER says, We see in these images, for example, an uninhibited celebration of the separation and transcendence of mind over body: a disembodied intellect hovers over a barren and regular landscape, the clear line of thought being all that is necessary to create and control. It is the ultimate control fantasy: \"the images of supreme and effortless power from a distance.\" This is a very glib and powerful image but it does not tell the whole story. Th ere will be interactions with other human beings in virtual reality and we all know how quickly visions of control and perfection evaporate in the heat of interpe rsonal interaction. There is also the prospect of virtual worlds created by chaotic and fractal algorithms which will yield novel landscapes filled with st range plants and animals. Virtual worlds will have their own laws which will restrict th e control of the individual over circumstances. There is also the prospect of artificial i ntelligence creating entities and environments with their own agendas.

Psychologically, the current interest in VR might be viewed as one expre ssion of the goal of spiritual ascensionism disembodiment to free the trapped spir it. A compulsion in this direction undermines the sense of wholeness w hich involves holding the tension of the opposites between corporeality and spirituall y. It presents a new challenge to the conundrum of mind /body split, the pr imary psychic wound of modern western man. Grandiosity or inflation may be a natur al side effect of this new technology. The new awareness this technology br ings us requires grounding, integrating, and digesting. The inevitable interpenetration of the virtual world with the physical world will tend to heal this division of the electronic mind and the physical bod y. This will occur in a number of ways. Most intimately, there will be the looping of body performance into the virtual realm. The computer representation of the body could change color as the person performed a particular physical task such as a tenn is serve or a martial arts movement. The virtual representation would accelerate the learning of a physical s kill. The internal physical processes such as blood circulation, muscle exertion , electromagnetic brain activity, blood chemistry, etc. could be detecte d and externalized so that a person could walk around inside a visual representati on of their own body. These applications would lead to a whole new level of self-aw areness and biofeedback or neuralfeedback training. Beyond an individual's self-explorations, the physical world will be im ported into virtuality and computer-generated objects will be exported into external physical reality. Video windows driven by cameras will bring external scenes in to virtual reality. Robotic manipulators/vehicles will be able to translate activit y in virtual reality into actions in the external world. Transparent glasses which can display computer graphic \"overlays\" will be able to show an individual virtual objects superimposed over his normal visual image of the world. With appropriate sensors, physical actions with respect to these computer objects will be converted into control information for computer devices. Wh ile it may be simple and easy to envision a hermetic seal between virtual realit y and physical reality, that is not what the future will hold. Even with a mind-set that denies the body primacy, the body is affected. It d oesn't matter what external forces influence the patterned firings of ner ve cells. The body cannot help but be profoundly influenced by its experience in virtu al reality. Its biochemistry and electromagnetic field are influenced, as well as gland ular activity. This has tangible results like any emotional experience. But VR Therapy h as the potential to be much more impacting than, say, a trip to Disneyworld; or a movie.

Psychology is investigating the common ground between itself and spirituali ty. Most psychologies see the value for well being within some kind of spiritual quest or perspective. Different experiences condition our worldview and our vi ew of ourselves. Our image of our relationship to the universe, and optimal conduct within that realm is the province of philosophy. It involves the primary questions: \" Who am I, why am I here, and where am I going? \" VR experience could affect an individual's response to these questions, opening a broader reality. We know that the new computer technologies such as virtual reality are her e to stay, whether they get used for positive or negative purposes. In principle, it conforms with the basic definition of magic: \" Magick is the art and science of causing change in conformity with the will ,\" according to Aleister Crowley. VR certainly brings us a giant step toward literalizing that notion. But to what end? If not to aid ourselve s and our fellow human beings, what is the purpose? Speaking of the philosophical implications of the new technology, Frank J. D yer reminds us that eastern philosophy has long recognized the virtual natur e of existence. The marvelous universe of discrete objects is an illus ion. It is a veiling of the true transcendent nature of Reality through restriction of our consc iousness to the world of apparent form. This illusory aspect of the manifested univer se is termed maya in the yogic philosophy and in Vedanta. In yogic philosophy, all of this manifestation exists for the purpose of providing certain classes of experi ence to consciousness, individualized as the Self at the core of each person's be ing. This could be the ultimate application for Virtual Reality, to enhance and ac celerate that process.

It is shaped by t he frozen states of consciousness, the existential images, that define and mold the s elf and the reality of our perceptions. And, when it finally emerges into awaren ess, the images and plots that are presented to our almost-waking self are reflections of th ese states. They are another way of seeing the self and the reality we create, except one l ess prejudiced by our ego. When we are asleep the ego is asleep. The ego is turned off and free consciou sness has reign. Awake we order all we sense into the conformations of our \"pre- ceptions\"; but asleep, chaos reigns, and the structure that emerges as t he dream is like a holographic image (in multi-dimensions) of the deeper self. A hologram is an image that is formed by reordering the reflections of a laser be am from an object. As the light encounters the object, like a pebble dropped into a pond sends ripples to the edge of the pond, an interference pattern of the l aser's wave form is created as the reflected and source waves interact. If we could st op the action in the pond and measure the ripples, we could reproduce thei r source. So too with the patterns of waves caused by the laser's encounter with the ob ject, we can reproduce an image of the original object. This interference pattern is what is recorded in the hologram's negative. Interestingly, the entire image is in any part of the negative; if you cut the n egative inhalf, the whole image is recorded in each half, just somewhat fuzzier . The whole image is in any part of the negative, the universe in a grain of sand. The dream is just like the hologram. The passage of the consciousness strea m through the psyche, and its encounter with the frozen consciousness st ates, cause ripples and patterns. When they reach our awareness, they create images of t he deeper self that formed them. The whole is in any part of the dream. FLOWING WITH THE DREAMSTREAM To the shaman/therapist, nature repeats at all levels and in all ways. In chaos theory, this is expressed in the self-similarity of fractals. Like the h ologram, fractals repeat the basic conformation of their \"parent\" pattern. They repeat th at same basic form over-and-over on different scales. The broad-strokes of nature app ear as"},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":"flow. The guiding metaphor of dreamhealing is the concept that a river and t he stream of consciousness have much in common. Guiding a dream journey is like guiding a white water river adventure. Graywol f's River Teacher is also the river of inner consciousness (dreamstream) that flows through the dream-scape and self-scape. Both are full of rapids and tur bulence, back eddies that trap one in circles going nowhere. There are calm, deep, pe aceful and serene stretches and unexpected twists that open new vistas. Both the river and dreamstream inexorably flow to the primal ocean, the sea from which all lif e has arisen, the ocean of chaotic consciousness. Like the River Teacher, the consciousness stream is full of boulde rs and rocks that define the river and make the rapids and turbulence. These boulders are the frozen images that define our dis-eases. The dream guide, like the river guide , undertakes to bring his fellow adventurers safely through the turbulence and beyo nd the rocks. Water always seeks its own level through flow along the path of least resist ance. In the river there is a flow of water that is part of a cycle. It is a process--an d that is what the stream of consciousness is--it is a flow. Within the river wh at makes the rapids is the rocks, the obstructions. They are the hazards. They create tur bulance around them. The psychic equivalent are the frozen states of consciousnes s, the frozen existential images, which obstruct the free flow of creative c onsciousness. They are what creates the turbulence within our psyches. Basically, that is what a rapids is--a turbulence, where the flowing syste m is far- from-equilibrium. Of course, that is where all the excitement is in a r iver trip, and also in the dream journey. You have to get into the turbulence. Another inter esting thing is that in a real river there are eddies or backcurrents that are cr eated around rocks. If you get into these eddies you just spin in a circle and go around and around in them until you can get back into the flow. In creative consciousness work it is the same thing. You find these little fantasy loops. They are always right in the mid dle of the crises, the rapids, and always reflecting this rock or this frozen con sciousness right in the middle of the river. This is where the idea of being imaginative as a guide comes in within the d ream journeys. Typically, people will come for dreamhealing when they are in a cr isis. In dreamhealing the eddies are the games they play, the patterns they get i nto, their self-serving fantasies, their wish fulfilling daydreams, or excurs ions in the \"heavens\" of their belief system. When people speak of the outer river, they notice it is always the same, yet tot ally different in every moment. It is constantly changing, becoming differen t than it has has ever been or ever will be again. It is so random that the same water you see at this instant will not be the same as the next. That complex, dynamic flow is also the description of the consciousness f low--always changing, yet always constantly the same in essence. And it is also the descri ption of"},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":"chaos--determinate indeterminacy or indeterminate determinacy. Al ways the same, yet ever changing describes fractal programs. They are self-similar, self -generating, and self-iterating. The source of a river's water and its goal are the same--the ocean. The source of t he creative consciousness flow is the vast sea of consciousness, that primal field of pure potential. We seek immersion in that creative consciousness for renew al and healing. The creative consciousness or dream guide and the river guide are much the same. If you think about how they are trained you realize that no river guide can lear n this skill from a book. The training is as much visceral as intellectual. The expe rience is best learned from those who are experienced themselves. Guides lear n from other guides whose voices are rich with experience. They have to go down the river themselves, hands on, by going through the rapids. They have a guide with them the first few times to teach them the river fundamentals. That is how the dream guide trains, by experiencing both sides of the pr ocess, experiencing first-hand the flow of the dreamstream. Facing the f ear and pain means that any sense of anxiety is transformed into a sense of excitement. The se regions become familiar, even in their ever-changing appearance. The train ing needs to be a total experiential training--not a rule-book training. Yet ther e are some guidelines (guide's lines) for river running which parallel th e creative consciousness or dreamhealing process. Good guides are intuitive. They intuit their way through rapids sometimes , reading the river and responding instantaneously with the right moves, easily and automatically. That is what you must do in the dream journeys. There are some rules that river guides use, such as \"follow the bubbles.\" The whole idea of going down the river, if you are a river-runner, is to \"stay in the current.\" It is when you get out of the current that you get into trouble. If you are in the current you are going to miss the rocks, you are going to flow through most rapids. So, you've got to learn how to flow in the current. This is an essential aspect of being the dream guide, learning how to be i n that flow of consciousness, and stay in the current. Any good river guide knows that how you \"set up\" determines how you are going to go through that set of rapids. Setting up is the key to a successful run. You've got to set up where the flow is the greate st, where the most water goes. That is the best place most of the time. It is exactly the same with the dream guide, who also has foreknowledge of some possible obstruct ions. The point you go through is important, and depends on your intuition, your imagination. Once you're in the flow you always keep your bow pointing toward the trouble. Y ou always face the trouble. In river running you can power-pull away from the rock and avoid a problem. One of the essences of the deam guide is that you always face the fearful things, the danger, the pains, the frozen consciousness that ap pears in the"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"dreams as images. You always face the frightening moment, the dangers, as in the rule of river-running. We wouldn't send anyone down the river without a guide. For one thing they would get trapped in those circles, those back eddies, spinning. They might get caught in a fantasy loop instead of the consciousness flow, because they don't know h ow to set up. Guides look at where the bubbles are to set up for the flow. That is like the intuition in dreamhealing. That is not a bad way of describing the feelin g of intuition sometimes. Reading the patterns in the river and the hidden variables becomes automa tic. The dream guide watches the shapes of the frozen images, of the feedback loops , and from that he feels the patterns of the stream of consciousness, of the ps yche. That is exactly what the river guide is doing. Yet, the rules are not set, either for a river guide or dream guide. The gui de uses them, but lets go of them in many situations. Each journey is different, uni que. You don't always follow the rules. That is what makes a guide, sensing and instant ly responding to the changing conditions. In a sense you can't have a textbook for either profession. You just have to listen to the river, the River Teach er, and see what is is telling you. The river always teaches about life and it is always teac hing you about that flowing, dynamic process. The river provides apt metaphors of li fe, which can encapsulate an individual's life patterns. Graywolf had a woman client who was very fearful, frightened of eveything. She tried desperately to maintain control of everything. Through most of the jour ney she couldn't let go, and rode in the raft with him. Toward the last day of the journey, she finally decided to try it on her own in a tahiti (inflatable kayak) . Graywolf went ahead and she followed. Half way through she lost her paddle, t he tahiti turned around, and she simply decided to let go and floated through f ine. In camp that night, she accused Graywolf of making her let go. But, no, it was the river! Another adventurer from Mexico was prone to getting \"stuck\" in places . He'd been working on an anima issue, his feminine side. He would get trapped in sit uations and not give up. They came up to Blossom Bar rapids; one guide went through to show the way. Even with instructions on how to get through on the current, h e got trapped on \"Picket Fence,\" with water pressure so strong the tahiti was stuck there to stay. It wrapped around a big rock, and he could not dislodge it no matter how hard he tried. He climbed onto the rock, clinging for dear life. Graywolf waited for the other guide, while the client continued his efforts to free the boat until h e was exhausted. The guides finally got through \"the chute\", pulled hard and got into the back eddie closest to where he was stranded. They could only get part way there--enough t o throw him a line so they could pull him around to climb right into the raft."},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"He had to jump right into a raging torrent of water. It took a great deal of faith to trust the guides, himself, and the equipment. But he did. It really took \" letting go.\" When they got back, he began examining his self-defeating \"fatal attractions\" t o certain kinds of women whom he knows are bad for him. He decided to let go of that, too. The role of the guide is the same in river guiding and dream guiding. In eit her case you accompany the person through the rapids. You direct them how to get through the rapids. You watch, and go through them afterwords if they get stuck or go into a back eddie. The river guide provides safety. He doesn't take you places it is not safe. It is exactly the same for the dream guide. The guides keep you away from those dangerous things that could flip you over, or hurt you. The guide has been through many rapids before. Perhaps they were not these particular rapids, but we know he survived others, and has developed some skill. (S)He's been through enough of them to read the currents, back eddies, and rocks. The dream guide is there to provide that security and that sense of safety in the process. The guide carries the person through their fears. Another obvious link is that river running is done for recreation. You r un a river of consciousness with a dream guide for re-creation. Dreamhealing is for re -creation, and the difference is only a hyphen. Re-creation is deep play in the most pr ofound sense, and it is healing. By re-creating, re-forming ourselves we access ne w potentials, new possibilities, new vistas. The river guide is always prepared to leap in if he or she has to. If someone is running some rapids and gets in trouble, it is the role of the guide to inter vene. They have to be prepared to jump into whatever river is there. We deal with whate ver comes up. When you head down a river for days, you commit to taking these people into your hands. There is the same commitment with the dream guide. It is a shared adventure. The river guide or dream guide will often go down first to show how it is done. The guides never push, rather they invite or beckon others through. \"Come on, let' s go; I've been here; it's O.K.\" So there is a need for trust. If you're going to be a guide you've got to be trustable. You can't say \"I've been there,\" when you haven't. You can say, \"I've been through lots like it; let's go.\" In terms of the journey itself, the river guide will tell people what i s coming up. Maybe before they leave he will teach about safety. If you fall in the water k eep your feet pointing downstream and trust your vest. If your feet are out you can fend o ff or push off any rocks. Keep your feet pointed toward the danger. The guide lets you know when there is danger, and admits that it is scary, yet OK. The guide always has that sense of scared excitement in the most challengi ng runs, but still gets through. Both the river guide and dream guide prepare the c lient with this awareness."},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"In terms of physical preparation, in the dream journeys it is important to s peak of relaxation. The dream guide might say things like, \" If you get in trouble, I'll remind you to breath, \" or \" Use your out-breath .\" In preparing for a creative consciousness or dream journey, you let go of any ideas that you have about what this particular journey is going to be like. Its the same with the river guide--they know that river is always different. You never go t hrough those rapids just the same way. They know that. It's always a new experience an d you let go of what you know to experience it anew. Just the chaotic nature of the river itself assures that. The good river guide doesn't go into the rapids with a preconception at all-- \" Well, I came through here last time like this. \" Instead, they still keep their bow pointed to the danger, they still have to pull off from rocks, they still have to stay with t he current. It's the same with the dream guide--let go of anything you ever th ought you knew about dreams. Each journey, no matter how many, is a new river. The unexpected is expected, and this is what defines imagination. This is where the dual-consciousness is important to a dream guide. Yo u are in that flow of consciousness but there is still a kind of dual-awareness of participating in this adventure, yet remaining the guide. You don't take the trip for the cli ent, he experiences for himself, though the guide facilitates or expedites th e practical aspects of the journey. VENTURING IN THE SLIPSTREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS What goes into preparing for guiding people into their dreams? There are ju st a few basic directions, but the finesse with which they are applied make s all the difference in keeping the process moving. Some of the most important points to remember include the following: let the imagination flow; lead or invite the dreamer toward the fear and pain wi th reassurance; lead them away from ego gratifying fantasy by deepening past their personal belief system; enliven their experience by repeating key el ements they have previously mentioned; use the basic \"confusion techniques\" to overr ide or short- circuit the rational mind; and switch the focus of their awareness f rom one sensory system to another, for example, from visual to auditory, or olfactory, or feeling. Just as crucial is your preparation of yourself. Begin by centering, breathing d eeply, and emptying your mind of any preconceived notions about the dreamer and the dream symbols, or where the journey might lead. You don't want your personal ity to get in the way of the process. You may create a neutrality within yourself, and paradoxically, by not being there you are more totally there. Contemplation or meditation can help you shed any attachments to the meanin g of the dreams or the outcomes. For example, at Asklepian dreamhealing c eremonies the guides may dress up as priests or priestesses, yet they are not claimin g to"},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"represent God. The healing notion here is that god is within us all. Pe rhaps you have to \"borrow\" me to see that about you, but the priest is only a mirror. As long as we are all aware of that, its OK. Mirrors don't take themselves very deeply or seri ously. They just reflect back what is. When, as guide, you listen to someone first describe and then re-enter t heir dream, pay attention to what you are naturally drawn to in the dream. It may be certain symbols within the dream, or it may be an aspect of the ground of the dream, i ts background. Once again, you must approach the person's dream with an open heart and shed your own issues or keep them in abeyance. To arbitrarily assign a particular meaning to a dream before the dream jour ney, and before hearing all of the dreamer's personal associations to the imager y is comparable to \"mind rape.\" Let their drama have all the time it needs to un fold before venturing any amplifications from your own store of knowledge and wisd om. A symbol may appear in the initial description which you think is \"fr aught with meaning,\" or maybe one of your personal favorite images comes up such as your totem animal. However, this may not be the best doorway for the dreamer to enter . When opening to what you are drawn to in the dream, try to keep your personal likes and expectations out of the process. Remember, the dreamer is doi ng this work for him or herself, not for you. Just go back to the basics, like encouraging movement toward the frightening prospect. Invite them into the fear an d pain with reassurances. After a while of practice your intuition becomes quite trustworthy. Th en, after the session, you might even venture to amplify certain symbols adding a mythic dimension to their presence in dreamlife. Some of the basic Jungian arc hetypes which might come up include figures representing the shadow, or anima an d animus (the inner mate). Others such as the elements, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water are also significant. Once again, when listening to the dream, clear your mind and open to intuit ion. Notice what stands out for you. Take a moment to reflect on why you are drawn to it. Does it seem intrinsically important in that dream context, or the co ntext of their life situation, or is it merely fascinating to you personally? As they recount their dream, watch their body language, inflection, and words they misspeak or st umble over. These signals can provide clues for an entry point or inner doorway that shows f ear or conflict within the client. Remember to generally move the person t oward the uncomfortable parts of the dream, giving permission and providing some sens e of safety for the unpleasant event to manifest, rather than avoiding it. Remind t he client you will be there along with them to guide and comfort and see them through to the conclusion of the journey. There are three processes going on inside you as dream guide. It is impor tant to know which one you are tuning in to when you are going to work on a dream,"},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"particularly someone else's dream. Of course, one of them is the intell ectual process, which is your mental information about what symbols mean. You can draw on your whole background experience intellectually making relationships between what you know about the person and what their d ream symbols are saying. That is an interesting process, and at some levels it is a usef ul process because dreams can be revealing at that level. The therapist can derive useful clues on where to take the therapy in other modalities beside s dreamhealing from these symbols. THE DREAMGUIDE'S ISSUES: THE WOUNDED- HEALER Another level comes from the subconscious and involves that which touc hes on your own \"stuff,\" your own issues. We all have our personal wounds. Inside all of us are unresolved issues based on our life experiences which we have not quit e worked out yet. Most therapists know when they are touching their own stuff becaus e they are drawn to it. The remedy is to make sure you have a place and time for your own process work. When your stuff is \"up,\" you are attracted to it in another person. This same mechanism operates in romantic relationships where people with t he same issues, even though they may be hidden, couple up. The unresolved issues, such as co- dependence can be a very strong draw which is very different from the draw of true love. A lot of therapists wind up getting people to the point of their own issues and can't take them further. Because they are drawn to their own issues, they subc onsciously or inadvertently direct their own clients to studying the therapist' s issues in themselves. The third level of internal processing comes from genuine intuiti on, or intuitiveness. It is easy to tell the intellectual process from the other two. But it is not easy to tell the difference between your intuition and your unresolved stuff. So t ake a close look at what you are attracted to in others' dreams, being with that reflective awar eness very personally. There is no objective answer to this question. Much of th e dreamhealing process involves making subjective choices and distincti ons and acting upon them with faith and courage, and trust in the process. Look for the emotional, intellectual, or intuitive quality of the draw. But r ealize that even true intuition can come as a mental or an intellectual thought. But it seems to come from \"out of the blue\" rather than building as a string of rational though ts. There may be almost a perceptual \"purity\" to it, instead of it carrying an emo tional charge. On the other hand, it can present with a lot of affect, but the stre ngth of that charge does not come from your personal involvement with the issue, symbol, or image."},{"pageNumber":1228,"pageContent":"Sometimes people come who have issues that mirror your issues, and you are together in order that those things become resolved for both of you. So you do not have to pretend that you don't have issues. This is more likely to come up if you find yourself working with friends and acquaintances, rather than as a profe ssional. It comes up in the personal arena. In the dreamhealing session you do not lay your stuff or your interpretation of their behavior on them, but your similar is sues may illumine things for you more objectively. WHILE YOU ARE THE GUIDE, THE FOCUS REMAINS ON THE CLIENT'S NEEDS. However, the question is not so much if it is valid to deal with someone who has your issues. Rather, it is a question of how you know inside of yourself wh ether the issue is your, theirs, or both. If you know it is one of your issues, then you kn ow you are on dangerous ground, and probably have some attachments to outcome and control. You stand a good chance of getting stuck on some detour to nowhere in the dream journey. You can't lead them past the point you are stuck yourself. So w atch out for this. Remember to ask yourself if they are doing this work now for you, or for themselves. In this kind of dreamwork it is very important for you to keep your issues out of it, and not to lead nor be attached to a specific outcome. The point is to create a flexibility for times when you are conflicted and can't be neutral. In chaos theory, as applied to biological evolution, flexibility means adapting \" rapidly and successfully by accumulation of useful variations ,\" (Kauffman, 1991). As dream guide, it means you develop a repertoire of alternate suggestions t o move your client and yourself out of the \"stuck\" place. One of the easiest is to foc us them in on another sensory system, for example switching their focus from visu al to auditory, or visceral. Another is to go deeper by giving suggestions which confuse their rational mind, which opens them to a more receptive state. THE CRUX OF THE PROCESS COMES DURING ENTRY INTO CHAOTIC CONSCIOUSNESS. AT THIS POINT THINGS USUALLY GET WORSE BEFORE THEY GET BETTER. Here you can give suggestions to intensify emotions, and to reassure the client you are there to provide some sense of saf ety. Let them know they won't drown, even though awash in the intense imagery. After all, this becomes a well-known experience for you, and you learn to t rust the healing nature of the state. Just let go and \"float\" down to the next calm spot. It i s OK to let go. Create your own particular way of letting the client know th at they can accept and surrender to that state. Help them amplify awareness of th at state by evoking more detail from them. While you are guiding, just let go when you begin to enter those states of chaotic consciousness, and stop guiding. Just see what emerges out of that chaos -- pe rhaps a new image, a new structure, a new existential state of being. THE NEW STATE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE A REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT, A VERY HEALED IMAGE. At first, we could not understand"},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"why. We were speculating that it was part of the natural evolutionary process. Or perhaps it comes from the safety of the therapeutic setting. Chaos theor y shows that \" certain complex systems tend toward self organization and are marked by the capacit y to evolve ,\" (Kauffman, 1991). So that may be part of the answer. The nature of strange attractors can be viewed in the metaphorical as well as mathematical sense. They are almost like nuclei around which the chaot ic image reforms, creating a new structure. One of the ideas expressed at the 1991 in augural meeting of the Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology, which took place at Saybrook Institute, was the concept that the therapist him or herself might BE THAT STRANGE ATTRACTOR. The personality of the practitioner is always a variable in any psychological experiment. We had speculated that the safe environment might be the s trange attractor, but did not take it that one step further to \"psychotherapist as s trange attractor.\" But that makes sense in light of the charisma mystery-peop le emanate. The deduction is that whoever creates that safe environment is a \"therap ist.\" Both clinicians and theorists at the conference were supportive of this i dea of therapist acting as strange attractor, even though there is as yet no scientific proof of that . If, as a dream guide, you are indeed the strange attractor around which that co- creative process of re-organization of a person's internal imagery revolves, it demonstrates how important it is that you have your own issues resolved. You wil l probably never solve all of your problems, but you can do your \"original pain\" work, and provide yourself with a time and place for honoring your own process. As dream guide if you are a flawed attractor, that flaw is going to be built in an d perhaps even magnified. We have known in psychology for a very long time, that the client frequently takes on the neurosis or the problems of the therapi st, but in their own way, of course. The client inevitably begins taking on a lot of the therapis t's characteristics or personality traits. The unconscious absorption of the therapist's traits happens automatic ally to a greater or lesser extent as both the self image and worldview of the cl ient is changed, broadened, and enlarged. In the process of therapy, the client is clearing em otional blocks, reclaiming frozen feelings, and lost or abandoned parts of the sel f. This process is experienced largely through images and sensate experience which fuses mind, imagination, and feelings into a gestalt. The training process of the therapist grants access to a deeper experie nce of the self which appears to be contagious. The therapeutic personality has the emerge nt capacity for curing dis-ease because the mere presence of a healthy pers onality acts as a tonic or general medicine for those who contact it. In other words, if you are truly individuated, you can trigger off the same process in other people. To be individuated means you express your unique essence most fully, rat her than learning and practicing by rote. It means you have explored the heights and dep ths of your own inner world, integrated that into the context of ordinary life, and fr eed"},{"pageNumber":1230,"pageContent":"up your creativity. This process is contagious because when a person meets so meone whose worldview is more expansive, their limitations automatically begin to dissolve. Through contact with a whole person's worldview, new possibili ties become obvious. It is a truism that few know their own capacity. THE SHAMAN IS THE ARCHETYPE OF THE WOUNDED-HEALER AND IS PERCEIVED AS HAVING MANA OR PERSONAL POWER FOR HEALING AND VISION. In today's society the shaman-therapist functions in much the same way. It is not possible to practice therapy without first having worked th rough your issues and your wounds. Doing therapy on someone else will bring up your core issues if they are unresolved. The idea of wholeness equating with healing is inherent in the anci ent alchemical notion of the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. One who has been able to make the incorruptible stone within himself has united the opposites with in, including masculine and feminine, and the depths and heights of the personal and transpersonal realms. Unreconciled opposites manifest as conflict, yet carried together, dis tinct but conjoined, they manifest wholeness and increased psychological health. On ce you synthesize a new viewpoint on reality, you discover a new sense of well-being an d contentment. This is actually more of an on-going process, not a final goal. It is a process/goal. You can expect many rounds of this same process in life's perp etually changing circumstances. As you let go of an old worldview, you go through the birth canal and regenerate in a new dimension of awareness. You have a new self image and many new potentials in life. Each time you go through the cycle you gain awareness and maturity. Much of this process goes on automatically in your dreams. Your personal growth i s tangibly affected when your old self interacts with new states of bein g that arise spontaneously in dreams and dream journeys. Your new identity comes both fr om your conscious and subconscious experience, and the shift is from emo tions to imagery to awareness. Your expanding awareness is in part autonomous, with a high degree of independence and self-direction. If you come upon negative images in your dreams, be assured that successfully confronting these, facing your fear and going through it, initiates an expansion of awareness and changes your self image. Positive figures in your dreams may be u sed as a resource, integrating their characteristics into your actual behavior and identity. True knowledge of yourself is the knowledge of the objective psyche as i t manifests in dreams and other subconscious imagery. To meditate on this is an effort tow ard self-knowledge. This is not necessarily in the interest of the ego, bu t lends some objectivity in answering the question, \"Who am I?\" There is a tendency in the helping professions for people to consider themselves \"healers.\" This is an especially popular term among alternative health pr actitioners"},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"whose practices range from body work, to crystal healing, to channeling, breathwork, naturopathic medicine, rebirthing, ghostbusting, to transper sonal psychology, and more. Each \"healer\" speaks of myth, magic, and mystery and offers up their spec ial wisdom as a healing balm. Thus they are likely to capture and contain the projections of others. Their unique personalities act as a \"hook\" for arche typal projection of the client's inherent healing resources. The projecti on mobilizes them. There is a great responsibility which comes with declaring oneself a s elf-styled healer. For the dependent, it is their task to carry that projection for a wh ile, until the client can re-own it and develop a relationship to the inner healer. It is, in fact, this inner healer which truly does all the regenerative w ork in therapy. The therapist simply helps the client access it. But it is the res ponsibility of the therapist not to kill the projection prematurely, for that is murderous to the soul. In time, the client truly begins to experience that all the healing resou rces are within. The therapist as a strange attractor functions as the nucleus of an unpre dictable yet deterministic process of growth and healing within the personality o f the client. The therapist functions as the attractor for a client who is far-from-equi librium. THERAPIST AS STRANGE ATTRACTOR Scientists are using chaos theory in psychology to uncover the fallacy behind t he old notions of observation leading to predictability in behavior. We need new nonli near ways to think about personality. The old linear models rarely could predict the specific behavior of an individual. Yet, people tend to behave in characteristic ways over time and in differe nt situations, within their own unique limits. Still, sometimes in dividuals are inconsistent within themselves, due to internal conflict or new inp ut. Chaos theory might disclose the hidden order in these variable patterns. Some personality theories are based on traits and others on the changing dynami cs of states of consciousness. But whether you consider traits or states as th e stable base of personality is arbitrary. \" The effect upon observed behavior is the same; that is, stable internal factors generate behavioral continuity ,\" (Middleton, Fireman, DiBello, 1991). A personality model can be totally deterministic, and yet not predict sp ecific behavior. Yet ordered chaos can predict trends. The strange attractor can b e viewed as fostering trends or events in a certain area of influence, but you can't pr edict exactly what at any given time or place. This may provide some evidence that the therapist functions as a strange attractor in the psycho-social field b ecause of unique personality traits. Within the therapist's own personality (and any other individual for th at matter), there is evidence to show that chaos provides an opportunity for behavioral change,"},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"adaptation, and self-organization. A personality trait, such as compassion or connectivity, may function as a strange attractor of associated behavior. One again, this means that one becomes therapeutic by expressing one's unique w holeness along with skills, rather than learning therapy techniques by rote. In the complex dynamic system that is the therapist-client relation ship, the idea is that the therapist has a certain magnetic quality that sort of pulls the be ing or the mind into a region of peace, stillness, gentleness, or safety, togetherness, and integratedness. So when the client goes into the state of chaos there is a magn etic pulling, and a feeling of \"it's OK to be here.\" It is experienced as a settl ing into a region of chaos that does not result in returning more dissociated and dist urbed, but enhanced, more integrated. Not every therapist has this sense of integration within, which can be pe rceived by others as a heart-felt experience. One indicator seems to be the ther apist's need to maintain \"control\" of the situation. Based on this, the need to address any iss ues of co-dependence becomes obvious, since extreme need for control and bou ndary issues play a large role in this syndrome. They undermine the necessary fle xibility. Therapy is like any intimate friendship, with one crucial differ ence -- the whole interaction revolves exclusively around the emotional needs of the clien t, not the therapist. The dream guide must unite the opposites of gentle-yet-selfless gu idance with letting go and trusting the process. The magnetic quality of the therapist may lead t o instinctual choice of one practitioner over another when a client is \"sh opping\" for a therapist. It might be viewed as a \"prepared heart,\" which may not be perfe ct but resonates with the client. A DIFFERENT REALITY Our perceptual systems, our sensory systems have as a prime function the t ask of creating some kind of order out of an otherwise totally random, confusing mor ass of information that is available at any moment of time. We actually have trillions of bits of information bombarding us at a given time. Our senses and perceptual patterns create some type of reality struct ure out of that. In this sense you can consider our perceptions and our senses, our geneti c makeup, how our senses operate, as a strange attractor. Because this is essential ly what creates some kind of order out of totally overwhelming input. IN OTHER WORDS, WE LIVE IN A TWILIGHT ZONE, IN ESSENCE, BETWEEN ORDER AND DISORDER. What creates order is our presence, our being, our perceptual patterns, our own sensory systems. As we share common genetic backgrounds, we tend to have senses which are very similar. Maybe we t aste things a little differently than someone else, but basically, unless me dically impaired, we taste vinegar about the same. We taste sugar about the same. And so we create similar realities."},{"pageNumber":1233,"pageContent":"We come to a consensus about reality. Yet our common agreements about reality are conditioned by our shared cultural trance (Tart, 1992). They may be based on that essence of strange attractor. Deep down inside what holds our view of the world together; what makes it consistent? How we store that information then b ecomes important--and more fundamentally how it forms. The reality we form basical ly emerges from how we are living. How do we get that view of reality? When we begin to form we don't have any consistent prepared pattern. Yet almost everyone has seen that babies have distinct personalities even as newborns. Formative experience begins in the womb. We've got all our perceptual mechanisms, we've got the senses, but we form our existential position, or view of reality, our beliefs about self and world, e ssentially from our experiences. They are based on how we perceive, and how our senses r eact to those experiences. That stores inside of us. Especially in the preverb al stage, it is stored as images. The nucleus of that memory, that position, that consciousne ss, is a multi-sensual imagery which describes the nature of the self and the world. If the world is a really threatening place, and Mom and Dad are terrible, and t hey beat me a lot, I grow up with the existential belief that the world is a dange rous place, and is going to hurt me all the time. I'm somehow deficient or unlovab le. It's more than words. It is an image, and not the normal image you might think of. It might just be colors, it might be a swamp! Who knows what that image is l ike in the dream? When you get down to it, it may surprise you first how complete it is , and how utterly alien it is to any thing you think of as an image of the world. And that essentially is the order that has been created out of chaos at a very formati ve stage, a young age. The strange attractor has been essentially a combination of a person's sensor y patterns, perceptual patterns, and the environment and what is happeni ng to them. It forms the basis of an individual's personal mythology, which forms the basis of the belief system, which forms the basis of how we think and feel abou t things. This in turn determines how we behave, which then feeds back in a circular way from our belief system to our behavior. The circular pattern makes sure everyt hing, positive or negative, gets confirmed. So, if you go deep beneath that belief system, down to the deepest existen tial image, then you are at a place where you can really do some changing. We noticed in dream journeys and other consciousness journeys, that WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THAT EXISTENTIAL IMAGE--THE VERY BASIS OF THE IMAGE OF SELF--IT IS SURROUNDED BY FEAR AND PAIN, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT USUALLY FREEZES STUFF IN PLACE. When you get deep down to that image, there is always a doorway to another deeper level. Since that is the primal image that formed out of the original chaos, the bl ueprint for personality, the doorway inevitably leads into the chaotic state. When a per son is"},{"pageNumber":1234,"pageContent":"able to let go of the old image, and truly take their awareness into that chaotic st ate, it begins to reform. Chaos theory states that there is always a structure in the chaos. Always a new structure, a new form emerges out of that chaoticness. The Buddhists sp eak of the death-rebirth experience: in order to be reborn you have to die. You have to en ter into the chaos in order to be reborn. This is referred to as dissolution. It i s the fundamental level of restructuring which happens in this work. In developing the dreamhealing process, the question has always been, \"What determines the new image that emerges in physiological, emotional, and beh avioral change?\" Chaos theory provides the clue that there is this concept called a s trange attractor -- an energy field, or something that somehow provides the nucleus ar ound which the new order forms, that determines the shape of the new order . It seems that is what the therapist provides, partly through the environm ent, but partly through the idea or experience of co-consciousness. An important par t of this work is the co-consciousness, the fact that as the dream guide or the con sciousness guide, you are actually going along with the person. So, in essence, as the dream guide, you really go into the chaotic consciousness w ith the person you are guiding. You are taking a structure in there with you, but no specific agenda. At the same time you are letting go and entering that chaotic consciousness, as the therapist you are still maintaining a degree of inte grity and order within yourself. As you take the person in, it seems that becomes s ort of the strange attractor which allows the client to begin to reform their basic existential image of self. To some extent, it is going to look like the therapist's existential image of w ho you are. It includes a higher degree of unconditional positive regard for yoursel f, which the therapist has modelled. To some extent, the client's response is goi ng to effect the therapist's existential image of the world through feedback. The psych osocial process is dynamic and interactive, and both parties are changed to some extent . When two people are in proximity, they literally exchange atoms, such as gases, wi th one another. This is why it is so important, that as a therapist you are solid. You provide a str ong view that the world is OK. \" I can deal with it; it is safe; even if it is not safe, I can still deal with it inside. I can center; I am balanced and peaceful .\" And if you can provide that, it form the nucleus for the new existential image for the person you ar e working with. You have provided this stable core as the therapist in many ways. You provide it by modeling stable behavior that is still flexible, creative, and spontaneous. You do it by the way you set up your office, what pictures you put on the wall, what music you play, how you touch them, how you greet them. But you provide it on a deeper, more profound level, not just the surface le vel. Consciousness is transpersonal and has much deeper connections with people. The"},{"pageNumber":1235,"pageContent":"therapist as nucleus or magnet is very reflective of who you are, especiall y during the co-consciousness excursions. CHAOTIC IMAGERY There seem to be two kinds of chaotic imagery. When we take people on journeys, when we go into chaotic consciousness the re are two types of imagery that demonstrate the state. One of the ways of knowing you are in chaotic consciousness is when you are faced with a blackness or void, or a gray or monochromatic color. They enter into t hat, or maybe a sense of emptiness. By giving over to that emptines s, or grayness, or that blackness, all structure dissolves and it is like a nothingness. This is a form of chaos which tends toward absolute emptiness or ZERO. The other form of chaos appears when the journey le ads into a spiral. That is one of the most common forms of entry into this chaotic consciousness. People spot a spiral, they enter int o that spiral, they start spinning, they get totally disoriented, and become almost overwhelmed. They may become very dizzy or even ill. That form o f consciousness is an overwhelmingness, or infinity. Out of either one of those we seem to create the essence of the new structure, the essenc e of the new reality. We are not really sure they are different, rather they are probably just diffe rent sides of the same circle, seen from different perspectives. On one s ide it tends to zero, and on the other infinity. This is not unlike the Gnostic concept of the plenum and the void, being one paradoxical union of opposites. A plenum is the opposite of a vacuum, being fully occupied in this case by im agery swirling in a chaotic way so it is not differentiated. So much information is there, it looks chaotic, overwhelming. It is a fullness rather than emptiness. In ter ms of physiology the plenum represents hyperarousal while the void is hypoarou sal. A variation of the spiral, the whirlpool, vortex, or tornado, tends to become overwhelming, while a solid color tends toward the emptiness. But it can be both. Sometimes the emptiness leads into the whirlpool, and vice versa. When you h ave been there before repeatedly, you come to trust these states implici tely. The client does not usually know that s/he will be OK, and that is what t akes courage on their part. You can help bolster that courage and confidence with you r demeanor and suggestions. It may be more empowering to view the therapist- as- strange-attractor as catalyzing or triggering the same process in the person undertaking the journey, but that is a more old fashioned perspective. The therapist may perceive herself as the reforming agent of the process. H owever, it is truly mutual, and co-creative in the deepest, most critical sens e. The guide always maintains respect for the voyagers' innate capacity to heal themselves."},{"pageNumber":1236,"pageContent":"As the therapist, you must be careful not to get stuck in either your own or t he client's belief system, or at other various levels. One of the best ways of initiating a journey is to totally empty your mind, and become that completely neutral force , and that is not a contradiction in terms. It just sounds that way because \" neutral force\" is only paradoxical when you try to put it into words. Take yourself beyond any belief systems, beyond any expectations of what you are going to see on the journey, where you are going to go, and how the person is going to come out of it. In other words, totally divorce yourself from attachment to direction and outcome. CO-CONSCIOUSNESS: WE TWO ARE ONE The co-consciousness and co-creative process is a neutral creation. The therapist can provide that neutrality by coming along without an agenda, or preconceived notion, orbelief system. There is no attachment in that state to anything except bei ng on that journey. You must be willing to go down into that chaos with the other pe rson, while at the same time you are maintaining an integrity within yourself . That neutrality allows freedom. At the same time as you are influencing the new existential position, i.e . \" the world is an OK place, and I'm OK, \" you are not influencing any specifics. You are not saying, \" this is what you should do and be, or where you should go .\" You are not operating at that belief system level. You are operating at a more fundamental level. You just provide them with the basic sense that you are peaceful and ser ene: \" The world is an OK place, and no matter what is happening you are going to be able to flow through it .\" And this is really the nucleus or the core, and it is a neutral one, though it is charged with a guidance that is empowering for the client. If you look at Taoism, one the very fundamental aspects is that out of the chaos came the yin and the yang. Applying that to this process, except in reverse, the client and guide come down until there is just this paradoxical yin-yangness of the co- creative process, and then that dissolves into the chaos. It then comes bac k out. It is sort of like a dip into chaotic consciousness, and then out--a baptism. As contributor at that last possible instant before you cross over into that chaot ic state with the person you are guiding, you are laying the foundation as the strange attractor for what comes out. Using this model, we are only trying to provide a consciousness map, so we don't get stuck during the process work. In the dream journeys we may momentarily leave the co-consciousness, pop up into the rational mind and check where we are against the ego model, especially i f we are stuck somewhere. The journey is intuitive, but it requires some str ucture for the process to maintain its form. The maps are not the journey, but they are use ful. Reassurance for the client can provide \"drops of oil\" for the process, so th at what was stuck can simply \"slide past.\""},{"pageNumber":1237,"pageContent":"There is, as in Buddhist meditation, a point where you drop all concepts and conceptualizations. Yet you find in Buddhist literature voluminous re ports of the different states encountered on the inner journey. All really good therap ists have models of how they work, and many write books about them. But frequently under observation they do not seem to be \"following\" their own models. After a certain point, the assimilation is so complete that the intuiti on can come in with a lot of latitude for dealing with unique situations that may come up. There is little need to follow even your own policy here, but rather simply do what you already know at the heart-felt level. This \"knowing\" is actually a combinati on of your essence, training, and intellect. This may feel riskier than \"canned \" therapy processes, and you may make some mistakes, perhaps needing to backtrack. But ultimately spontaneous guidance needs to be included. It is much like learning an art-form. You learn the basics and the techni ques, and then just let it flow. Do what you know from the gut-level. There is no ne ed to be a slave to the intellectual process. It is much like when you climb Mt . Everest, you need a base camp, then you go beyond the safety and structure of the base camp. The consciousness maps just provide a way we can communicate and teach on th e intellectual level. We don't need to hold the intellect in disdain as do many new age types and othe r practitioners. Sure its good to get in touch with the body, feelings, and ope n the heart center. But they are not mutually exclusive with exercising your mi nd. That is just another emotional reactionary state based on a belief system. It is a re action to our culture's overemphasis on the rational mind for 200 years. There is no need t o be at war with it. Intellect and intuition are actually part of a common field. It is a valuable p art of our psychic balance in life, and it is important to integrate it, not rejec t it. It does not have to dominate. It is an integral part of our being, and a powerful tool. Keep it as an integral part of the process. It can give you a structure beyond which you can journey. It provides a vehicle. It lets you know, for example, when you are stuck in your own issues, so you can back off. One of the ways we can realize that we are stuck during the process is b y becoming aware of a frustration within. Graywolf has noticed that as soon as he gets into th at frustration, he knows he is not really frustrated with their \"stuff,\" but himself, because he is stuck there too. When it comes time to check back with the map, very often that is the opportunity to drop that attitude and back up into your neut ral space again. THE DREAM GUIDE AND CHAOS THEORY There are some sessions that in spite of time, space, and years remain memor able sessions. Graywolf's first spontaneous experience of leading someone int o the swamp--into the chaos--in the co-consciousness state was such a session . It changed his perspective and philosophy."},{"pageNumber":1238,"pageContent":"The amazing thing at that time was that the client went through remarkable changes and only needed to come back a couple of times. Prior, it had looked li ke long-term therapy, not brief therapy. Providing some structure for the proce ss allows you to go even deeper, allowing for restructuring of the primal self im age. The model is still evolving. THERE IS A SENSE IN THESE SESSIONS OF SOMETHING BEYOND, BEYOND CHAOS OR WITHIN IT, WHICH RESHAPES THE BIRTH OF REALITY AND THE UNIVERSE ITSELF. We don't know what it is, but w e know it is there. Someday we will have a model for that, and proceed from there. Hopefully, it will give us permission to go to an even deeper level. These models or consciousness maps are not \"sacred truth.\" But if you want to become a musician, you have to first learn how to hold a guitar, or blow the flute , etc. Once you learn the basics you can be creative, but there are basics you nee d. It may not be important for you to learn how to read music. What is important is that you know how to hold the guitar and play some chords. Then we can create music together. And this is what these models attempt to convey. The concept of the guide or therapist hopefully serves to clarify some as pects of the process. When we first started trying to describe this process, all I kne w was that we went somewhere, and people experienced something there. They came out of it changed, emotionally and even sometimes physically. In order to teach, we neede d a model that provided a language that people could understand relative to the process. Right now not many people understand the scientific notion of chaos or th e language of chaos theory. But the importance of chaos is that relatively soon it may be understood by most people. It is a major revelation and revolution in scie nce about the basis of reality, much like relativity in the early 1900's. Ultimatel y it means we, as psychologists or people helpers, can stop studying human behavior only from the linear perspective or analytical mode, and explore nonlinear dynam ics which are relevant tothe whole person. Humanistic psychology posits that life is lived subjectively, and chaos theor y seems to validate this notion helping describe and understand behavior, experien ce, and intentionality in nonlinear terms. In the creative process, humans att empt to bring values into existence, whether those values are artistic, social, technologi cal, or spiritual. And this process of human creativity may have an underlying chaotic process which selectively amplifies small fluctuations and molds the m into coherent mental states experienced as thought. Chaos theory is ultimately a language which can be used with mathematicians, biologists, engineers, physicists, chemists, and anybody who has experienc ed subjective chaos in their lives. People are tuning in to this new theory t o help explain things to themselves, personally."},{"pageNumber":1239,"pageContent":"That is why we choose to use the language of chaos theory, like strange attractors. I t just seems to fit. Now, one of the questions that confused us was \"why w hen we lead someone into the state of chaos, don't they come out worse?\" You are letting go of all structure, so why isn't it worse, instead of inevitably better, a better self image? The use of the word 'strange attractor' is just because there is a paralle l in chaos theory, not because this process was derived from chaos theory. It was not based on it, and didn't evolve from it. It is based on empirical observation. They are analogous. This is how things structure out of chaos through self-similari ty. It produces self-generated spontaneous order. The innate OKness of the chaotic state is uncolored by personal experienc e. The guide serves as the \"silver cord\" for going deep into that process, yet bein g able to always find a way out. As the guide you are the anchor or contact back with ordinary reality. It is OK to stay there in the chaos during the session, and then move on when it becomes appropriate. What emerges from that forms a new beginning. Furthermore, what happens at the client-therapist level is reflec ted in the larger setting at the group, social, and international level. We live in very complex, dynamic situations, which are subject to the effe cts of small fluctuations in initial conditions. Big changes can result from small fluctuations in individuals. Even our whole species is coming into a new relationship w ith the planet. We don't know what the new strange attractor will be, but we see m to be going into the chaos now, politically, socially, and economically. The more a system tends toward one polarity, the more the internal energy of th at system tends to want to take it in the opposite direction. In other words, t he more rigid someone is becoming, the more susceptible they are to the total l ack of rigidity, or collapse. The more structure, the more order, the more likely they are to go over into the chaos. We live in a twilight between structure or order and chaos. Being stuck in either order or chaos is no good. So we shouldn't think chaos is the greatest thing. Jung also observed this tendency in individuals toward 180 degre e shifts. He termed it ENANTIODROMIA. The path through, or the Way, lies between the opposites. Life is lived in a maze of opposites. Swinging recklessly bac k and forth leads to inner turmoil and conflict. This is a continual reactionary, rat her than creative state. Or we get stuck, or go into denial. Genuine transformation comes through the new image or transforming symbol , which harmonizes the opposites, and creates completely new possibi lities. We are constantly creating, and once a structure gets created we need to allow the dance of Shiva, from structure to nonstructure--the dissolving. It is the flo w that is important. Destruction, recreation, destruction, recreation. In the dr eam journey, fighting the process of letting go can result in physical manifestations li ke jerking, or the ego defense of fantasy cycles."},{"pageNumber":1240,"pageContent":"ENTERING THE FLOW When Graywolf takes people on the river for whitewater rafting and dreamheal ing, he has the help of the river in demonstrating what flow means. A person can p addle and fight the river all the way, or find that flowing rhythm. The river includ es both rapids and still places. It wouldn't be any fun at all if it were all rapid s or all still water. If it is all rapids, it is tiring; and if it is all calm water it is st ill tiring because you must paddle all the time. The flow is the issue, not being here or there . As the dream guide you are not helping people to establish a permanent str ucture. There is no point to that. There is no end point to this work of dreamheali ng--no conquering hero (\"strong ego\"). The goal is not even to feel better, or any parti cular goal. The structure you are developing now may reveal flaws in itself, then you let that go back into the chaos and dissolve. It is OK to reform a better structure f or yourself. It is not so scary when you realize the chaos is not a permanent state. Dreamhealing is similar to LSD therapy in that it helps the client expe rience the opening to self which lies beyond ego death. There is recent increase in LSD research again. When it was banned in the early 1960s, it was being hailed as the treatment of choice for those who didn't respond to other other psychothe rapy techniques. Now it is being used abroad for treating anorexia, obsessive-co mpulsive disorders, depression, and addiction. The lower doses used enhance the therapeutic process by making memo ries and represeed feeling more available. But as in dreamhealing, the presence of the guiding therapist is crucial. In OMNI, Oct. 1992, Peter Baumann, M.D. states, \" If a patient feels fear during the trip, they might do anything to distract them selves or run from that fear. The therapist urges the patient to a certain degree to stay wi th it, to examine the problems, understand where they are coming from, and see them through. \" They report a virtually universal increase in self esteem among their patients. DREAMHEALING ACCESSES THE SAME STATES AS LSD THERAPY WITHOUT DRUGS. Feedback tells us that many clients have immediate res ults where other method have failed completely. This has even been physiologic ally documented. Using biofeedback monitoring Graywolf has guided people int o deeper theta states than they achieved with their own therapists. Now we are inve stigating the practice of dreamhealing in float tanks. One group has developed a very th in membrane which allows for the sensory deprivation experience without u ndressing or getting wet. The nature of reality is an endless flow between the opposites. The sub jective comfort of any state is determined by where you have been stuck--if you are s tuck on the non-order side, flowing to the order side will feel good. If you are stuc k on the order side, flowing into the chaos is liberating, for a minute or for a while an yway. Then flowing to the other side is even better."},{"pageNumber":1241,"pageContent":"But you can't go into the dream journey with any pre-set notion. You have to be with each individual and their unique experience of the process, whet her it is comfort or bliss, or terror. That is the neutrality, and the co-creative proc ess. It can be different for each individual each time. Each dream journey is uniq uely different. In Buddhism, as you get more and more focused in meditation, you begin to see how things come into existence, and how they fade away. The mind gets so sharp you can see the way reality comes into existence. It comes into sharper focus. Eve rything slows down so you can see the process. The images get created for a period of time, and then they dissolve. At that poin t, the mind usually gets attached to the process and is really curious about it providing there is not a lot of emotional content to it. Even if fear comes up, you just be w ith the fear and learn to see that emotions are just creations which also arise an d ebb away. Emotions come into existence and fade away. Once you understand that you can begin exploring other places, without so much emotional content. For example, as the mind gets into a pain in the leg, the mind begins to focus on all the destruction in the universe. Moving from the s pecific to the general, there can be imagery of destruction and holocaust. But due to the poi se developed in training, you just stay with that terror and watch it come and eventually go. Gradually you get led into this nothingness, which many people actually enjoy. One of the reasons people don't want to hang out there is becaus e they are afraid they will never make it back. There is something they are han ging onto, an attachment. This is the same attachment Krishna spoke about in the Mahabarata . The unique aspect of dreamhealing over Buddhist meditation is that you can actually have someone there with you, in co-consciousness, when you are going through these things. Its sort of a guided tour of the bardo states. It takes th e interactive verbal process, and even a degree of psychism, to keep pace with one another. During a long retreat, people begin to discover the creation side of internal imagery. Reflecting into the outer world, one can then see the coming-into-exist ence within something as apparently mundane as a green leaf. It can become the most marvelous experience, containing the whole of creation within itself . Dissolution and regeneration leads to an experience of ultimate potential. You can move between the states, which is what makes up life. It may feel safer to explore with a neutral, empowering guide. During a dream journey, be sure to give the client plenty of time to respond in freedom by waiting patiently. Pati ence comes from trusting the process, and trusting the person you are working with-- not to be safe for you, but to find their internal healing resource. If you are there total ly, you simply do not feel irritation in that state. To some extent you are actually, as guide, in a trance state or altered state yoursel f.

If it becomes a dynamic system that is doubling back on itself, and it is feeding ego gratification fantasies, it requires inter vention or guiding. It is much easier to avoid these pitfalls in the first place, than to backtr ack the client back out of them. We have a philosophy about procrastination, and it really applies to being a guide. We don't see procrastination as all wrong. About a third of the time if you procrastinate things will really screw up, so you've got to do something. Another third of the time, if you procrastinate nothing much will happen, either p ositive or negative. Another third of the time, if you procrastinate that is exactly what you have to do in order to free the system and make it better. The secret is knowing when to procrastinate, and when not to procrastinate . That again is probably the essence of being a guide. Most of the time it is appropriat e to hang in there with the client, but there are times when it is really b est to say \"break it here,\" or \"go here,\" instead of going around and around. It is knowing WHEN to do that. You can give them the sense that they don't have to be stuck there, that it is OK to do something else. Another aspect involved is the essence of the co-creative process. It is different with each individual you work with. One might be an experienced meditator with years of inner work, while another might have just had a nightmare the night before and come in off the street. Each brings something unique to the process of co -creation, and you do something qualitatively different with them. The words might b e similar and a lot of what you do may be also, but the essence of the co-creative process is different. A client \"prepared\" by other inner experience does not necessarily h ave any advantage over someone who has been previously non-reflective or outer-orient ed. Either of them can enter the journey naturally and deeply if that is wh ere they need to go in their journey. The inexperienced may even have less preconceived not ions, or personal interpretations of the experience, and allow themselves t o experience it viscerally. Dreams are a particularly good way of initiating children into the therapeu tic process. Frequently you may be the first one who has shown a serious inter est in their inner drama. They feel much more free to talk about their imagin ation, and may feel much less self-conscious than when discussing their per sonal lives. For example, a child comes with a nightmare of werewolves wanting to tear him apart in bed. All you have to ask him to do is let that happen, and he's into it, without year s of meditation or other visualization training. Parents won't even think to instruct children in therapy NOT to talk abou t their dreams, as they might so-called \"family secrets,\" [\"no talk rule\"]. So oft en the children feel totally safe to talk about dreams when they are subject to ve rbal, physical, or sexual abuse at home."},{"pageNumber":1243,"pageContent":"It is a co-creative process which involves every aspect of the client's li fe and experience.

In an era when all we therapists were hearing mostly about dysfunctionality, (as the public discovered the recovery movement), it was refreshing to hark back to the idealistic notion of optimising growth potential.

It traces in developmental stage form the growth of the relationsh ip between the individual ego and the collective preconscious which und erlies creativity and psychedelic or mind-expansion functions. The work is based in thee idea that the preconscius is involved in a developmental process which starts with anxiety and ranges to creativity through well known stations on the continuum of mental heal th. Gowan expanded the continuum of the developmental process outlined by hum anistic psychologists (Erikson, Maslow, Rogers, Piaget). He included mystical/tran spersonal states of consciousness and their attendant phenomena, including those occuri ng naturally, through meditation, and as the result of drug ingestion. Gowan's use of \"psych edelic\" is not synonymous with \"drug related.\" His overview includes the work of Kub ie, Sullivan, Tart, Masters and Houston, De Ropp, and Krippner, among others. Before \"self esteem\" became a buzz-word for the 90s, he defined a devel opmental continuum with equally vital dimensions of cognition and affect, rational and emotional development. Perhaps even more importantly, he surveys the positive and ne gative effects of natural escalation compared with developmental forcing on subsequent em ergence of creativity and personality change. Further he constructed a psychological test measuring the process/goal of self- actualization. In 1972, the Northridge Developmental Scale was bootstrapped from the Personal Orientation Inventory (Shostrum, 1966) and other measures of self -concept, emotional morale and psychological well-being. Gowan proposed three modes of cognition: prototaxic, parataxic, and syntaxic, which h e amplified as trance, art, and creativity. They indicate the styles and degree of immersion or cooperation betwen the ego and the preconscious. They range from dissociation, t o propitiation, to conscious contact with the irrational and numinous eleme nt--from unconscious insstinctual response, to (usually symbolic) self-consc ious ego processes, tto inner, paranormal \"uncanny\" aspects. GOWAN'S ORIENTATION Gowan's major works, including THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CREATIVE INDIVIDUAL (1972), DEVELOPMENT OF THE PSYCHEDELIC INDIVIDUAL (1974), TRANCE, ART, AND CREATIVITY (1975), and OPERATIONS OF INCREASING ORDER (1980) express his continued interest in the spectrum of human consciou sness potential and the defining of a relative taxonomy of such states. Though excellent, these wor ks were not"},{"pageNumber":1246,"pageContent":"widely circulated and are somewhat difficult to find, particularly out side of academic circles. J.C. Gowan's lifework led him to the notion of a developmental order within st ates of consciousness. This order (see Chart 1) includes three cycles (lat ency, identity, creativity) revolving around issues of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, int imacy, and generativity. Breeches of this order lead to a relative displacement of emo tional and mental well-being which can inhibit or prevent integration. Gowan used the work of Piaget to define the rational development of the min d, and that of Erikson to chart emotional development. Usually the cognitive level lags a stage or two behind the emotional; but opthers are emotionally stunted or frozen in t heir development. Our modern society has come to known this condition as dysfunctionality, in ability to consistently function in an age-appropriate manner. It is a dissonanc e between rational and emotional dynamics resulting in self-defeating or self-destructi ve tendencies. Gowan called it dysplasia, developmental arrest which holds back self-actualizing p otential. Escalation implies raising the level of action by discrete jumps--quan tum leaps in consciousness. Accessing latent energy resources escalates developm ent from one level to the next. Discontinuity is a requisite for change. Gowan defined developme ntal forcing as trying to escalate from a given stage to more than one stage higher through mechani cal or artificial means. He likened this forcing to developmental abuse: trying to use characteri stic powers or fruits of a given stage for display purposes when the individual is actual ly engaged in tasks of an earlier stage. Relative dysplasia results from not keeping up with de velopmental tasks--failure to escalate. But in developmental forcing an individual is e xposed to experiences or tasks for which they are developmentally unprepared, and f orced to attempt or react to them. Conversely, those who are well-adapted for their age can become stuck at any leve l of particular success. He notes that most mature adults become emotion ally arrested at the level of vocational fulfillment, financial success, and happy marriage. Anoth er stall may occur as the psychedelic nature-mystic experience where nature is e njoyed for its own sake. Success at any stage of development may promote the desire to continue at play r ather than integrating the lessons learned into the task of the next stage. Further d evelopment is an evolutionary task/opportunity. This notion fit well in the psychological context of its time--the human potential movement with its accent on growth and linear movement toward perfection or some oth er process of ever-elusive \"salvation.\" It is consistent with classical Jungian psych ology and humanistic psychology, and the general scientific paradigm of its time. Current notions in new generation Jungian thought, process work, and even pr ocess theology, are less focused on the developmental perspective of the coping he roic ego-- becoming--and more focused on the ground state of Being--the dynamic Voi d or naked reality.

A course-correction here in conceptualization could include what we have subsequently learned in 20 years of the study of complexity and chaos theory. The difference is one of ego control compared with \"letting go\" and trusting the natural process: ego s trength or flow/fluidity. The new paradigm--which embraces chaos--is express ed in science and psychology in such notions as complex non-linear dynamics, punctuated equili brium, emergent creativity, and self-organization. Operations of increasing order automatically lead to entropy, which facili tates the breakdown of old forms including outworn personality traits and states of cons ciousness. Experiences of the complex interplay of chaos and order are the instrume nt of all development as well as that of the \"psychedelic individual.\" Self-initiation through the inner guide (happenstance or intent) of ten leads, in a person with latent shamanic tendencies, to self-induced \"shock-treatmen t,\" the results of which the person is subsequently forced to confront in daily life. Two commonly e mployed mechanical means are drug use and marathon meditation, either of which can force escalation beyond normal social developmental stages. Even in those with a poor social foundation, this \"forcing\" may crystallize a sp iritual or inner-directed behavior which conditions or balances the individual in the short- or long- run. Thus, a dynamic if chaotic \"path\" or direction of development is chosen. T he more definitive the commitment, the clearer the emergent non-linear p ath and creativity. Gowan did allude perhaps to a dynamic interplay within the transformative process. Within each transition, he identifies certain components of change: su ccession, discontinuity (discontinuous equilibration), emergence or budding, differentiation or metamorphosis, and integration or creative repatterning. Together they d efine phases of developmental escalation, or shifting to a higher gear for more efficient u se of available energy. The objective of escalation is creativity. Integration in the developmental process includes five aspects: (1) con frontation of differences, (2) integration, (3) a yielding up or giving up of the old for a new reorganization, (4) a process of differentiation and (5) a positive directionali ty. In summary, Gowan piggybacks on the notions of Erikson and Piaget to create a developmental stage theory, which asserts four ideas: that the developmental chart has a periodicity of t hree, and that the last three cognitive stages are creativity, psychedelia, and illumination; that developmental stages are characterized by esca lation, and when that does not occur, open to developmental lags or dysplasia; that creativity is a characteristic of the third an d sixth developmental stages; that the stabilization and mental health of the pre conscious is the key factor in creative output and developmental progress. Gradually, the traumatic impact of the encounter between conscious and un conscious diminishes as the individual develops. The person learns how to handle issues of identity, love or intimacy, and finally death. Encounters with the \"not-me\" symbolize and express death of the ego, and prepare one for physical death by de-emphasizing sensory in put."},{"pageNumber":1248,"pageContent":"Rather than becoming traumatically overwhelmed, the personal identity e xpands to experience full emotional and cognitive acceptance of both freedom and resp onsibility.

This is why the concept of a free creativity is always associated with the genuine dange r of a \"treasure hard to attain.\" Peak experiences of creative possibility can lead to self-f ulfillment or self- destruction. Mystic atonement crowns the quest after lower developmental needs have b een satisfied. Gowan, seemingly a humanist, asserts that the proper use of the awesome powe r of the psychedelic stage is \" to protect and preserve those objects of individual man's self-concept starting with the health and welfare of his body image, and then extending outward to his invironmental self and its possessions, his loved ones, his associations an d interests, his concerns and finally his total environment and his creations, thus embrac ing all of his natural world .\" The small ego diffuses through cosmic expansion of the hierarchy of needs tow ard an enlarged sense of Self. According to Gowan, \" man's highest purpose is not to experience the world of the senses as a reactive being but to design it...to become part of the noumeno n of the universe ... co-creator...co-designer .\" He quotes Troward from 1909 as to how this can be done: There is some emotion, which gives rise to a desire, Judgement determines if we shall externalize this d esire, if approved, The will directs the imagination to form the necess ary spiritual prototype, The imagination thus centered creates the spiritual nucleus, This prototype acts as a center around which the fo rces of attraction begin to work, and continue until The concrete result is manifested and becomes perce ptible. This creative visualization cycle has practically become one of the foundat ion principles of New Age thought. Essentially, this same process is echoed in the transform ational realities of experiential psychotherapy. THE PSYCHEDELIC STAGE IN EXPERIENTIAL THERAPY Though it is arguable that there is no classical shamanism without mind- altering plants, therapy provides a perhaps more accessible form of \"drug-free shmanism \" as a socially- sanctioned alternative. This sanction and external guidance do little to m uffle the profound effect on participants in experiential journeys into the depths and he ights of their souls. The dangers are still real, for our fears and taboos are rooted in our personal beli ef systems, within our deep existential core. The navigational help of an experi enced guide mitigates the fears and defenses which prevent us from plunging into t hese depths on our own.

Through this means interior processes are deepened, and psychedelic consciousness natu rally emerges. It is often felt during the resolution or healing phase of the session as p rofound serenity and a sense of enlargement and communion. As healing continues (the physical form of creativity), the emergent psychedelia of the sessions becomes more g eneralized throughout daily life. Each developmental advance involves the increased cognitive confl uence with an understanding of this deepening interior process. By closing the gap between unconscious emotions and \"acting out\" with rat ional understanding of the roots of attitudinal and behavioral patterns, therap y facilitates healing of dysplasia and existential of mental and emotional faculties. Cognit ive dissonance is healed when our self-concept stands up to consensus reality checks and our thinking and feeling are in harmony; our existential reality matches our perception. H ead and heart cooperate, rather than tearing us in two. As most therapists will testify, we usually know what is \"right\" to do, but we tend to do what we feel like doing, even when it is self- defeating. When we consciously will our attention inward in a safe, therapeutic set ting, experiences emerge through process work which are virtually identical to natural psyc hedelic experiences. Their common elements can be summarized in seven poin ts, as defined by Gowan: 1) The attention of the subject is gripped, and his perception narrowed or focused on a single event o r sensation; 2) which appears to be an experience of surpassing beauty or worth; 3) in which values or relationships never b efore realized are instantaneously or very suddenly emphasized; 4) res ulting in the sudden emergence of great joy and an orgiastic experience of ecstasy; 5) in which indiviudal barri ers separating the self from others or nature are b roken down; 6) resulting in a release of love, confidence, or powe r; and 7) some kind of change in the subsequent per sonality, behavior or artistic product after the rapture is over."},{"pageNumber":1250,"pageContent":"There are phenomena common the psychedelic experience, mystical sta tes, and process work.They are typically the same, because the process/goal is the same n o matter what means we use to facilitate expansion of consciousness. As the ego goes throu gh its symbolic death throes images of dismemberment and dissolution prevail. The corresponding physical unstressing manifests as completely invol untary, unintended, spontaneous muscular-skeletal movementss and proprioceptive sensati ons: momentary or repeated twitches, spasms, tingling, tics, jerking, swaying, pains, shaki ng, aches, internal pressures, headaches, weeping, laughter, etc. Visceral experiences ran ge from extreme pleasure to acute distress. They may include bristling of the hair, persp iration, and burning sensations. Developmental forcing is felt as a shick, psychic jolt, or jerk. On the other h and, mystic ecstasy brings feelings of serene delight, sensations of the remotene ss of physical surroundings, and transpersonal ecstatic exaltation beyond words. Cosmi c expansion brings psychic phenomena in its wake. Yogis caution that these siddhis ar e epiphenomena-- powers which are actually obstacles to further enlightenment. Benefic ial contact comes through interpenetration of the preconscius and conscious mind. Mead (1993) reports that meditation has a definite down side for some indivi duals. Rather than promoting relaxation, it leads to stress, anxiety, depression, and even panic at tack. \"Relaxation induced panic\" manifests as muscular tension, racing heart, h ead pain, and perspiration. Schizophrenic breakdown has been triggered by meditat ion, as well as psychogenic illness, and suicidal tendencies. Typical side effects include sore throats, muscular cramps, tinglin g or stinging sensations (localized or general), feelings of heaviness or weightlessness, floatin g sensations, outbursts of laughter or crying, mood swings, involuntary sighing, sweating, trembling, and shivering. All of these manifestations appear in experiential journeys. When the sen sations are validated and deepened they transform, and the journeyer is transformed with them. Experiential therapy, like meditation is not a form of relaxation, but actually an ac tivity of attention and concentration, which raises our innate level of spiritual e nergy (chi, kundalini, Shekinah , \"the Force,\" etc.) with a body/mind altering effect. Once this force is aroused, it is unpredictable just how it will effect the mental, ph ysical, and emotional states. This is the hero's journey into consciousness transformation, the age-old quest. THE TREE OF LIFE: AN ANCIENT MODEL OF ESCALATION We have examined some conceptual advances which emerged after Gowan's pu blication. However, even though he didn't explore this particular mystical path or Way, m uch of his creative thought in developmental stage theory is echoed in or correspon ds with the ancient glyph of transformation of consciusness: the Tree of Life, as it appears in ancient Qabala and modern metaphysics. Jewish mystics employ this glyph from the Sephir Yetzirah , or The Book of Formation , for meditation. These kabbalistic practices have generalized into the West ern mystery"},{"pageNumber":1251,"pageContent":"tradition ass the practice of magic. The Tree of Life is a consciousness map and fountain- head of most occult arts. Theurgic magic, which aspires toward greater and greate r union with Self and Divinity, is a system of exaltive meditation and creative visual ization which employs ritual to alter states of consciusness at will in harmony with the cycles of Nature. In private correspondence with this author in 1982, Gowan made it known that he considered the practice of magic a form of developmental forcing, and theref ore dangerous, so he excluded it from his anecdotal reports of expanded states of consciousn ess. The Tree of Life depicts the interactive elements of the psyche as w ell as the archetypal forces of the universe. The 10 Spheres or vortices of this circuit repres ent the dynamic, interactive balance of archetypal energetic forces within the univers e and each psyche, and their corresponding qualities. The 22 paths of \" concealed glory \" on the Tree reveal the holistic feedback patterns, the means of transition and interaction between them--transitional states of consciousness. Gowan's styles of cognition--prototaxic, parataxic, syntaxic, and unitive states-- correspond with planes of consciusness: physical, astral, causal, and unitive. This Tree is a \"ladder of consciousness\" which each aspirant may climb toward higher mystic states. The physical biochemical basis of experience is symboliz ed by the bottom two vortices, which (ala Gowan) we shall call Succession and Emergence. Th ere is a vertical symbolic journey from the ordinary sensory consciousness of physical li fe (succession) toward the emergent psychic capacities encountered in the trance st ate (emergence). Traditionally, the bottom sphere represents the Elements of Earth, wh ile the trance state is linked through symbolism with the Moon, psychism, and surrealistic \"ast ral\" perception which is often bizarre or uncanny. \"Trance\" is achieved in therapy and ritual by interrupting ordinary awarene ss--by creating a discontinuity, disruption, temporary chaos. At this prototaxic leve l, the ego is overwhelmed, and transformations manifest as sensations at the psychophysi cal and psychosexual level. Self-image, perceptions, and sense of time may be tem porarily lost or distorted. The ego dissolves in unconscious communion with the primal p reconscious. Further development leads not only to a change in planes, but a change in the s tyle of cognition to \"Art,\" the parataxic mode, as expressed through gesture, body langu age, art, myth, ritual, dream, and archetypes. In this plane, the accent is on affect ( emotional response). On the glyph of the Tree of Life, the polarities are depicted as horizontally balanced centers of force, yoked opposites of Cognition and Affect (Hod/Netz ach). With greater experience an understanding of the inner world, a relationship d evelops which allows the ego to glimpse and participate with transpersonal forces. In the traditional correspondences Cognition is linked with Mercur y (Differentiation) and balanced by Affect which is associated with Venus (Metamorphosis). Th ey are akin to Will and Imagination, or perhaps the Jungian functions of Thinking and Feeling. O ne gains not only theoretical knowledge of Self, but also experiential awareness of the im aginal realms-- a \"virtual reality\"--perceived through the vision of the soul. The disson ance of dysplasia is replaced by a resonating congruence or confluence of both developmental forc es. This"},{"pageNumber":1252,"pageContent":"creates a positive directionality or momentum, an impetus, a facilitation of exstatic higher states in their emergent or bud form. We can summarize the correspondences of Gowan's components of escalation w ith the Spheres of the lower portion of the Tree of Life as follows: SUCCESSION = MALKUTH, Sphere 10. Implies the perception of the aspiran t that there is a fixed hierarchical order among the developmental processes. There i s a continual rise in awareness at each level, and the order of succession is invariant. At this l evel of awareness (Malkuth), it seems as if the track of development is fixed alth ough there is flexibility in rate and extent of progress. The main degree of freedom lies in the speed at which one chooses to escalate along the \"path\" of development. DISCONTINUITY = YESOD, Sphere 9. Postulates a series of discrete chan ges in levels of consciousness, much like the locks of a canal. Movement is from pre-rational to rational to trans-rational. Developmental escalation comes from strategically balancing or equilibrating the forces at each discrete jump, much as a clutch does when we shift gears. Additional energy is freed up for the aspirant through increased effici ency. EMERGENCE = HOD, Sphere 8. Shows the debut of new powers characterist ic of access to the Astral Plane. They are the prototype of latter abilities which can b e relied upon to function at will. First powers appear in tenuous form, and later they are p ermanent. Pathworking becomes more defined. One no longer follows a dim trail, but a cl early marked Way. Each stage is revealing the characteristics of the next phase in b ud-form. DIFFERENTIATION = NETZACH, Sphere 7. Refers to the enhanced focu sing and clarifying of concept formation accessable at the Hod-Netzach level of exp erience; emotional intelligence. Lest we become fixated in habits which preven t further development, a metamorphosis occurs in which there is a sudden swit ch in emphasis from one stage to another. It is much like an adolescent longing for childhood irr esponsibility which transforms into facing the future with a mature, methodical pr eparation. When we have been successful in one phase of life, the temptation is that we wi ll desire to remain on that level. In other words, we get stuck, and need to transform our hang ups to fl ow with the grain of natural processes. INTEGRATION = TIPHARETH, Sphere 6. We can finally put it all together in an integrated whole. This transrational synthesis creates new degrees of in sight, freedom, and creativity. All previous sstages are united in a holistic viewpoint, greater than the sum of its parts. According to Gowan, the road to high well-being and creativity has five m ilestones: \" 1). confrontation of differences, 2). integration, 3). a yielding up or giving up of the ol d for a new reorganization, 4). a process of differentiation and 5). a positive directionality .\" PSYCHEDELIA = DAATH, The Invisible Sphere. Direct experiential con tact with the numinous or divine element, multi-sensory \"visionary\" state, perceptu al synesthesia; complementary images of fullness and void; temporary but profound com munion with Nature, God, and Mankind; oceanic and peak experiences. ILLUMINATION = KETHER, Sphere 1. The Unitive state of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":1253,"pageContent":"Rising through the planes on the Tree of Life, \"climbing\" the tree, is a m editational exercise in consciusness-raising. Emergence is an operative princip le throughout the vertical \"climb\" up the Tree of Life. Emergent abilities are first gl impsed, and later stabilized. This aspiration is an instinctual urge to experience higher statess of consciousness, and the magical analog of natural escalation and development forc ing. We should note that aspirants to this path were always cautioned to have their e arthly lives in order before attempting to scale the heights. Just as Jung recommended the path of individuation only for those approaching m idlife, masters of the Qabala preferred well-grounded mature students, rare ly accepting those under age 30 for advanced training. Further, Rabbi Kaplan (1990) notes, \" a person would not attempt to climb a dangerous mountain without the proper training and equipmen t. Any novice who would attempt a climb without an experienced guide would be courting dis aster. Climbing spiritual heights can be equally dangerous. One needs the proper trainin g and mental equipment, as well as an experienced spiritual guide.\" When climbing the \"mystic mountain,\" balancing the Cognitive and Affect ive energy centers opens a Middle Way, a transitional mode of consciousness referred to as Art or Temperance. This path leads directly to the central sphere of \"Creativi ty,\" which radiates integration and magnetically draws us toward individualized consciusness , self- actualization or fulfillment of our unique potential. The emergence of this state as a creative impulse is glimpsed in the p arataxic mode, but its fruition comes through the stabilzation of syntaxic awareness--the qabali stic form of Self- realization, which brings a new sense of equilibrium and transmuttati on. According to Fortune (1935/1984), \" consciousness ceases to work in symbolic subconscious representations but apprehends by means of emotional reactions. \" Mysticism itself is one of the greatest arts, melding aspiration and artistic expression. This well-spring of creativity is the source of Intuition which bal ances instinct and proprioceptive Sensation. In THE TREE OF LIFE , Regardie (1969) states in no uncertain tterms that \" Genius in itself is caused by or proceeds concommitantly with a spiritual experience of the highest intuitional order .\" He considered self-discovery and spiritual attainment an evolutionary mandate. Aspiration leads up the Middle Way into the state of Psychedelia or mystic rapture, which includes the possibility of mystic rupture of the protective coveri ng of the ego if forced too far, too soon (Daath, the psychedelic sphere of Knowledge). Again, Rabbi Kaplan not es that, \" The further one climbs, however, the more rarefied the atmosphere, and the gr eater the spiritual danger. By a simple permutation, the word Kether (Crown) becomes Kar et, the Hebrew word for excision, where a person is completely cut off spiritually. \" The dangers alluded to include mental, emotional, moral, and spiritual chaos. In Jewish or occult meditation, when a qabalist enters the mysteries , he or she must parallel the sequence of creation. We first enter the Universe of Chaos wi th its confusion of transient images; even the Spheres are perceived as disconnected i mages. But by meditating on and experiencing the traditional paths, relationships bec ome apparent and a sense of integration develops as we realize we are that gestalt of the Tree of L ife. This"},{"pageNumber":1254,"pageContent":"\"creation pattern\" echoes what we find in experiential therapy sess ions where notions of the old self break down in chaos prior to connection with holistic rep atterning that heals and reveals an expanded sense of self. The stabilization of the Creative stage (\"Beauty,\" Sphere 6) leads to the as cension of transpersonal values in personality and behavior. So-called normal consciou sness can proceed no further, and ego (through this insight) diffuses into an expan ded sense of superconsiciousness. Though Gowan is vague on this point, the Qabala hints t hat access to higher mystical states involves the balancing of the qualities of Judgement or Severity (strength, fear, discrimination) with those of Mercy, Love, or Compassion, cor responding respectively with Mars and Jupiter. On a higher octave, it involves the downflowing of grace, a marriage of Understand ing (Saturn) and Wisdom (Uranus). This psychedelic state, Daath, is a contact wit h the macrocosm, the numinous element which resultts from the twin ble ssings of Wisdom and Understanding wherein the psychophysical self is \"contained\", yet e xpanded and diffused in pure consciousness containing no sensory imagery. It holds the secret of generation and regeneration and the manifestation of all things from No Thing. In Qabala, the developmental process culminates in complete absorption in the Un itive state of Kether, the uppermost vortex--Illumination.

C.G. Jung, TWO ESSAYS... The soul loses its psychological vision in the abstract literalisms of th e spirit as well as in the concrete literalisms of the body. James Hillman, RE-VISIONING PSYCHOLOGY Psychic and somatic symptoms express the soul's painful wounds and obstruc tions. The rational mind is incapable of deciding what is best for the soul. The mind can discover what is needed only by listening to and reflecting upon the subtle m ovement of the soul as it expresses itself in bodily sensations, feelings, emotions, im ages, ideas, and dreams. Robert M. Stein, \"BODY AND PSYCHE\" Throughout history there have been many conceptions about the physical and sp iritual nature of reality. Early on, they were confounded, though now separated into phil osophy, physics, and religion.

The realm of psychology, with its own unique perspective on body and soul , lies between the worlds of physical reality and spiritual heights. And, of course, ther e are many schools of thought in psychology, many of which, like behaviorism and humanism, do not consi der the relevance of a notion of soul as motivating factor. On the other hand, transpers onal psychology accepts the validity of the spiritual to the point where its pr imary psychological orientation may recede into the background. Jungian psychology, and its avant-garde form, imaginal psychology seek to maintain the primacy of the image as a direct expression of soul. As a discipline, it allege s that soul is a primary experience, and seeks to give her a voice. The realm of psyche is a subje ctive world of depth and meaning that is sometimes corporeal, sometimes not. Entry int o this style of consciousness means heightened awareness of subjective realities. Eac h \"thing\" speaks of the gods, or archetypal qualities and forces. It boldly asserts that not even te chnology and inorganic matter are inherently soulless. Imaginal psychology's main proponent, James Hillman, suggests it is only the lit eralist, objective world of Newtonian mechanics and the Christian apocalypse that is \"dead.\" This school of psychology views many \"spiritual\" notions as products of a monotheisti c style of consciousness. It puts forth the view that soul is a pluralistic expr ession, rather than an individual quality. It upholds a polytheistic perspective which is m ore in line with the primitive concepts of the nature of soul. It views notions like\"spirit ual soul,\" \"material body,\" and \"spiritual body\" metaphorically, rather than literally. Each god or arc hetype has its relative, characteristic style of consciousness and way of seeing th rough the nature of things. Jung and his followers have shown that certain mind-sets lead to biased fan tasies about the nature of the body, the soul, and the cosmos. Psyche is essentially related to s oma because it is rooted in organic structure. The intimacy of this relationship is not fully understood. It is a realm of mystery which brings in its wake phenomena such as synchronicit y and psychosomatic disorders. Religion and superstition undermined any remotely objective viewpoint about the physical nature of the universe until the Enlightenment. Then scientist s armored themselves against incursions of the divine with Newtonian mechanics and Cartesian dual ity. Descarte split mind from body, and equated the soul with the ego and mind, thus disenfranc hising it. The mechanistic, \"clockwork universe\" was based on the primacy of underlyi ng order. The universe was perceived as chaos tending toward order, with each atom followin g God's great plan. This notion of an orderly universe was superceded by the unpredictabl e phenomena of quantum mechanics and chaos theory. We have found that beneath the apparent orde r is complexity, a world of chaos that self-generates order, which dissolves back into chaos. Even orderly motion is ultimately unpredictable due to initial conditi ons and even the slightest of random intruding influences. So, the universe may still b e \"God's plan,\" but its basis is irrational, not rational."},{"pageNumber":1258,"pageContent":"Physics is a form of philosophy which makes educated guesses about the natu re of reality and our existence. It invites us to \"look at it this way...\" Scientific revolut ions demonstrate that these are not ultimate statements about the nature of reality. They are r elative, state- of-the-art hypotheses. This particular type of natural philosophy includ es many universal laws, however, which reflect the way things seem to be from the curren t point of view. It is difficult for any of us to free ourselves from our enculturated and a priori beliefs about existence. It is hard to view anything from outside of our own fundamental ph ilosophical, spiritual, and psychological perspectives. These theories, dogmas, and exp eriences condition how we perceive reality. Their influence may be so subtle w e fail to notice where our position originated. Our viewpoint is relative to our position. Einstein showed us that, in physics, all perspectives are relative to t he position of the observer. He discovered this by imagining he was riding on a beam of light. This r elativity holds true in psychology also, depending on what assumed truths one holds. N otions of soul and body are not describing any irreducible reality. These notions are rel ative realities, reflecting our personal understanding of the nature of reality. They eme rge from our specific worldview about the way things (including ourselves) work. What we believe conditions what we perceive, feel, and express. Research s hows our beliefs and opinions are largely conditioned by the belief system of our peer group. Th e day-to-day influence of convention creates a consensus opinion about reality and is a b ig influence on lifestyle. Much of consensus is a tacit agreement to overlook certain kinds o f information, especially if it doesn't fit the \"party line.\" Beliefs are subject to radical reversal in some instances--the proce ss of conversion. Jung called this 180 degree shift in consciousness enantiodromia. Conversions arise from a desperate need, from exposure to a new peer group with different atti tudes and values, or through embracing a broader worldview, or by covert means like propaganda and brainwashing. The prime expression of beliefs is through spontaneous imagery. We never exp erience directly, but interpret our experience of our perceptions through im agery. All our input comes through multi-sensory channels. We never directly perceive ours elves, soul, or God. We don't perceive our bodies directly, only our sensory impressions. But we do have first- hand experience of our body-image, soul-image, and God images. That is all we know directly. The rest is pure speculation. Relative viewpoints condition our concepts of reality, body and soul. A given ind ividual may hold several within himself. For example, a rational scientist may fin d no empirical evidence for soul in her normal methods of investigation, but it does not p revent her continuing practice and belief in her faith. The emotional self will not be denied, even if it is held discrete from the workplace. Historically, the body (and matter in general) has been a spiritual battle -ground. Because of the bi-polar nature of our being (or our perception of bi-polarity), the hu man spirit naturally comes into conflict with our earthy and material needs. These pr imal drives"},{"pageNumber":1259,"pageContent":"create conflict between spirituality and instinctuality or sensual ity. But the conflict is a matter of perception and psychological perspective. In the West, flesh was condemned for \"original sin\", a mandate forced on the bod y by so- called \"spiritual\" pontification. This mandate was extended to includ e the condemnation of all matter. In the East, the perception of any solid substance was declared a mental phenomena. Matter was seen merely as an expression of universal mind, redu ced to a gross state known as maya . In this state all matter is subject to karma, the natural consequences of active existence. In this worldview, the soul is continuously recycled . Both philosophies reject materialism, and the body with it. So matter is merely a convincing illusion in one view, while in another it is inherently evil, the very opposite of God. The notion of immanence holds, on the other hand, along w ith Pantheism and Animism, that all matter, formless or substantive, is natu rally infused with the divine. All agree that matter occupies space and time and is perceiv ed by the senses. Philosophically, matter is the formless material of the universe of s ensory experience. Each of these ideas, maya and the \"fall,\" provides a coherent worldview, yet remains d iscrete and congruent only within its own belief system, with its a priori assum ptions unexamined. In our culture, the body and our fantasies about it, have come to represent th e lost Feminine element. We have lost touch with our primal femininity, the an imating principle (nature, body, instinct). We have become estranged from the body through the m ind/body split fostered by Cartesian thinking, which is also non-relativistic . The image of the disembodied modern individual is one of an over-rational \"wal king head,\" not a whole human being. Our modern need is not for further disembod iment by transcending off into salvation in the nether-realms of space, not for more out-of-body experiences. Rather, we almost desperately need to create ways of truly inh abiting our bodies, unsplit by Puritanical and Cartesian residue. There is a way that joins spirit and body through the spontaneous imagery of soul. I t seeks neither to solve our troubles (pathologies) nor \"save\" our souls. It suggest s direct engagement with images for soul-making or deepening through personal experie nce. We can see through the nature of apparent reality for ourselves, if we but try. T hen we develop our own philosophy, apart from consensus. When it comes to questions of sp eculation on the unknown, we can either accept what others have said, or look for ourselve s. We seek the lost soul primarily because of the intense degree of wounding i n our modern consciousness. This wounding has \"opened\" us to transformation. We can e mbody soul by seeing-through appearances to an acute awareness of the archetypal, subjecti ve perception of our experience. We can find soul in the body. It speaks metaphorically in body language (how clos ed or open one is to life and experience), body talk (\"he's a pain in the neck,\" \"I can't stomach that\"), symptoms, and displacements. Conversion reactions change psychologi cal dis-ease into concrete ailments. Jung said the gods have become diseases and there i s a god within every disease. Noticing that psychic element and giving it voice is psychologic al soul-"},{"pageNumber":1260,"pageContent":"making. We can also look at our behavior, emotions, thoughts, and styles of consciousness psychologically. The conflict over the body is really between spirit and spirit, good and bad, p olarized. But it is popularized as a split between spirit and matter, with the soul as i ntermediary. To compound the problem, in linguistics and beliefs, spirit and soul have become mis- identified with one another by theology and philosophy. Philosophy, for the G reeks was an adventure undertaken for its own sake, without dogma, rites, or sacred entit ies. These disciplines pull the soul in opposite directions, leaving the alienated ego rejecting both mystical experience and the imperfection of the body. Thus we need recourse to priests (for spirituality), therapists (for psychological insight), and doctors (to interpret the condition of the body). All healing appears to come from without, when we cannot heal our own dis-e ase. The body is betrayed and mentally abandoned. Symptoms become something to get rid of , while the soul has no recourse to a higher power. Then the body becomes tyrannical, rul ing the self with addictions and psychosomatic complaints. It has many ways of manifesti ng dis-ease. The entire choice between spirit and body, inner and outer, has its sour ce in identification with the ego. Ego maintains itself by creating conflicts from opposing drives within. It suppresses one and makes you believe you have chosen freely. The dilemma com es from the ego, not the soul. Matter, spirit, and ego fight over the soul. Yet soul is a primary experience. Each wants its unique fantasy to reign uppermost. So, the first task is to distinguish so ul from spirit, so the body may unite and be enlivened by both. In this process, primacy is given to the perspective of psyche or soul. This is a psychological approach--not spiritual or religious-- giving voice to soul. It means the return of a subjective feminine eye on reali ty. It means the enlivening of our bodies, the world of nature, and the imagination. When we see soul as the background of all phenomena, we become aware of the animating principle All images arise from either body processes (instinct) or psychic for ms (spirit). Whether instinct-controlled or spirit-controlled, they are related to physi ological processes. They appear psychologically as images, but work physiologically. They produce emotional or visceral aspects, but not in any causal way. The images don't produce reactions. T he image is the entire psychophysical gestalt. We have considered three relative perspectives from which the notion o f soul may be viewed: theological, philosophical, and psychological. Each has its own distinc t notion about the body. Like Jung, we are not referring to a religious or philosophical conc ept of either body or soul. Soul may or may not ultimately be a disembodied, immortal thi ng as Zoroaster, Plato, and The Bible suggest. They uphold the pervasive cultural view that soul is a transcendent enti ty, distinct from the body, that participates in an idealistic afterlife. No one alive can say for sure , and what about this life, here and now? Psyche's view speaks directly to our whole per sonalistic experience, with its transpersonal elements."},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":"The soul in depth psychology is an empirical manifestation of imagination, fa ntasy, and creativity which is always in the process of becoming--images forming, and d issolving, and forming anew. Imagination is the essence of the life forces, both physical and psychic. These fantasies always permeate our beliefs, ideas, emotions, and physical n ature. Like the psyche, or life-breath, of the early Greeks, this notion of soul i s like that of the butterfly which always stays close to the ground. It is an airy thing, hoverin g lightly, without heroically soaring to the heights. In this model, there are no abstr act flights of fancy into spirit's realm, no transcending off into subtle \"spirit bodie s\" mistakenly distinguished as aspects of the soul. These urges are real, but they belong t o spirit. Rather, the soul generates images unceasingly. The soul lives on images and me taphor. These images form the basis for our consciousness. All we can know come s through images, through our multi-sensory perceptions. So this soul always stays close to the b ody, close to corporeality, to what \"matters.\" Let the images come into your body. Embrace the image. To heal the mind/body split we need a view of reality that eliminates the d ichotomy of \"in here\" in this separate body vs. \"out there\" in the alien, external world. Even physics shows us we are continuous with that world. Our skin-b oundary is an illusion. We literally exchange gases and atoms with one another, and the world. Th e turn- over of matter in the body means there is no single, stable structure over ti me--just a duration of consciousness. The line between organic and inorganic matter is indistinguishable at th e subatomic level. All that exists is alive with motion. Both body and mind are the realm of psyche which can manifest as particular behaviors, psychosomatic illnesses, emotional patter ns, mental and spiritual beliefs, and synchronistic events. Mystics tell us that the entire world of phenomena is of the nature of m ind or consciousness. Modern quantum mechanics seems to uphold this view f rom the scientific side. There is no solid matter, when you get right down to it--only waves of en ergy, \"quantum fuzz\", and probabilities. So, matter is no more tangible, nor les s divine than the intangible energy or light from which it congeals. It is a spiritual notion th at matter is a debased form of energy. But the perspective of spirit would not have us confuse the creation wi th the Creator. Yet, in some sense, the light is the Light, in the metaphorical, if not lite ralistic or concretistic sense. We are merely a local outcropping of individuality, embedded in a cont inuum of cosmic connectivity, a webwork of relationship. In so many words, it means, \"We are the world!\" \"In here\" and \"out there\" become moot when the subatomic nature of ma tter is truly understood. It becomes easier to see the nature of psyche as the underl ying, living, divine field of all experience and phenomena. At the deepest level, we are ph ysically indistinguishable from the cosmos at the quantum level. Our existence is one of an indeterminate electromagnetic field, rather than a distinct chemical entity. Divinity is not off somewhere else, long ago, or in the future. We don't need"},{"pageNumber":1262,"pageContent":"to leave the body, die, or travel through time and space to find it in \"pie-in -the-sky\" salvation. As the Buddhists note, all is self, or Atman, here and now always. The universal EM field is a primary physical, if not corporeal reality. Our ap parently discrete existence is contiguous with it. In this model there is no mandate for a \"soul-as- spirit body\" to leave or vacate the body for purification, enlightenment, or uni on with divinity. Only our state of consciousness keeps us from that moment-by -moment realization. Direct psychological experience tells us that \" I AM THAT. \" We are psychological beings, composed of body and soul. Psychic life is physical and mental. Spirit enlivens soul--it manifests through soul. Soul animate s the body. Soul enlivens and tends to favor the body. The body unites with spirit and so ul by becoming \"saturated\" with them, immersed in their essence. Denial of the body by a disembodied spiritual drive leads to ascensionism . It may be an escapist, transcendence fantasy. It is a way of keeping life at bay. In the pr ovisional life one is always waiting to live life if things are just so. We can reinhabit or re-own the body in consciousness and experience ourselves as total psychosomatic beings. Sp irit can be grounded in the body by making practical use of spiritual insights. The harmonization of spirituality and instinctuality leads to wholeness . For example, in sexuality, a spirit-body split leads to an inability to see one sexual partner as both sexy and spiritually inspiring. This may manifest through circumstances or a p sychological complex. It is an aspect of the Madonna-whore complex. The whole person, on the other hand, views the sex act as the divine marriage of spirit and soul, God/Goddess, Shiva/Shakti. It epitomizes the universal cycle of creat ion/destruction, mind and matter in play. This attitude exalts body, soul, and spirit. It is akin t o a nature mystic experience where the outer divine resonates and enters the bod y. The ancient art of alchemy was the search for the God-head in matter. The alc hemical task was to unify spirit and soul in the body. Psychic reality means to be in soul, esse in anima, as Jung put it. It means an enlarged experience of concrete reality to includ e the realm of the psyche, a dialogue with events, situations, and circumstances. Body is made complete, not by perfecting it, but by spiritualizing it. It becomes the vehicle of the \"incarnating Self.\" Spirit is attracted to matter and matter t o spirit. Matter gets purpose and meaning from spirit. An \"immortal body\" now means grounding of the spirit. The uniting of soul, body, and spirit was called the Unus Mundus, or One World in alchemy. As a psychophysical entity you experience the Anima Mundi, or Soul of the World. The Jews knew it as the Shekinah. She is the embodiment of psyche, the animating force behind all events, images, and material forms. Soul functions both in the body and th rough projection in the physical world. Psychic reality means to be-in-soul, thr ough embodiment (soma) or enlivenment (psyche)--perceiving images viscerally (soma ) and mentally (psyche). Acknowledgement of this force does not constitute Goddess worship--on ly recognition of the archetypal reality of nature, and our nature. She is a way of reclaiming the di vinity of"},{"pageNumber":1263,"pageContent":"body, matter, and world. The Soul of the World notion, though repressed, is part of t he return of the Feminine. Hillman invites us into this world: Let us imagine the anima mundi neither above the world encircling it as a div ine and remote emanation of spirit, a world of powers, archetypes, and principles transcende nt to things, nor within the material world as its unifying panpsychic life -principle. Rather let us imagine the anima mundi as that particular soul-spark, that seminal image, which offers itself through each thing in its visible form. Then an ima mundi indicates the animated possibilities presented by each event as it is, its s ensuous presentation as face bespeaking its interior image--in short, its availability to imagination, its presence as a psychic reality. Not only animals and plants ens ouled as in the Romantic vision, but soul is given with each thing, God-given thi ngs of nature and man-made things of the street. Hillman suggests therapy shift its focus from saving the soul of the ind ividual to saving the soul of the world, resurrection of the world, rather than man--a raising of c onsciousness of created things, the world's psychic reality. He says we have, in essence, take n and stored the world soul within ourselves. \"There is no 'in here' and 'out there'. We should give it back.\" Physical reality becomes psychic and psyche becomes real. It \"matters. \" The difference between soul and external things no longer matters. Inner and Outer wor lds are real. They are One World. Image, metaphor and symbol bridge the abyss between matter and s pirit. They are integrated with feeling, mind, and imagination. We can see soul in all nat ural objects. We can notice our fantasies constantly conditioning our experie nce of reality. We need to learn how to be in our souls, just as we had to learn to reinhabit the bod y. Being-in-soul implies that you are being suffused with spirit. Knowl edge of spirit doesn't come from ideas, even revelations, but through a reflective process. Th eir conjunction, or marriage, means spirit is reborn whenever you are in touch with soul. The y are opposites, so the interplay is eternal. Just observe without attachment the interac tion of soul and spirit, distinct yet conjoined. Hold the tension of the opposites. When spirit as energy and matter as form are in balance, the body becomes the livi ng \"Temple of the Spirit.\" The notion of a soul's immortality comes to m ean direct experience of non-spatial, non-temporal, four-dimensional reality--the realm of relati vity.
