A.'.. A Kircher Tree of Life is used as a trellis for the growth of conscio usness from the most physical states to the most spiritual. Each of the ten Sephiroth is treated as a type of consciousness that can be attained through orderly passage over twenty-two connecting paths. The Sephiroth are represented by circles and the numbers from ten (10) to one (1). The Twenty-two p aths are represented by lines connecting the circles of the Sephiroth and by the numbers from th irty-two (32) to eleven (11). [FIGURE # 2: Full page illustration of the Tree of Li fe goes here The Sephiroth are circles with only the numbers 1 to 10 inside them. The Kricher paths are draw n in, connecting the Sephiroth with simple lines. Only t he numbers 11 to 32 are placed on the paths. Curved arou nd the outer top of each Sephira is the name of the Sephi ra in Hebrew, while curved around the outer bottom of each is the English translation.]  [FIGURE # 3: Circle with \"MALKUT\" at the 10 top inside, \"10\" in the center and \"P hysical consciousness\" in the lower half]  The Sephira Malkut  10 Malkut is the Kingdom of the physical. Consciousness at this level is limited to phys ical existence and physical sensation. Little occurs that could be called self aware thought. Reflex, i nstinct and undigested memory of physical events are the highest qualities of Malkut consciousness. Thi s is the mental state of one who thinks only of living from moment to moment. There is no True emo tion here and no true reason, only the mechanics of existence on earth. A purposeless lif e is lived by nearly unconscious beings. The Hades of Greek and Roman legend is the lowest level of ex istence, the level of spiritless, soulless shells. Malkut is Hades unless it is joined to higher state s of consciousness.

The line is labeled \"Taw 32\"]  The Path of Taw  32  Malkut to Yesod Motion in the physical world of Malkut has a w ay of continuing. Insects make rhythmic sounds. Babies cry until their needs are met. Yet sometime s the insects seem to sing without need. Sounds made by a baby are often made for their own sake. Even the growling of frightened beasts tends to mimic language. Such sounds and actions are music and dance to natural rhythms. Efforts to attract a mate or parent or to repel an enemy gradually dev elop into primitive art, religion and law. [FIGURE # 5: Same as # 4, but now add Yesod.]  The Sephira Yesod  9 Yesod is the Foundation of imagination. When a peacock spreads his rainbow, he sees an astral peahen of great beauty. Children feel angels bending down to love them. Fear summons nig htmares of devils and gape- jawed horror. From experiences of the physical, dreams, visions and le gends are woven. These form a consciousness once removed from the earth, a lunar dream of lands unse en by mortal eye and filled with music that never came from lips or instruments. Yesod is beginning self awareness. Boundaries between self and other become dim. Harsh physical edges of Malkut soften into mental pressur es. Yesod does not know the fiery wall between ideas that produces Hod or the touch and flow that blends and separates in Netzach. [FIGURE # 6: Same as # 5, but now add path 31.]  The Path of Shin  31 Malkut to Hod From the pain and necessity of Malkut a harsh power grows. In the physical world there are teeth that cut and claws that rend. The farmer wounds ea rth that life may rise from red clay. A rose pricks with thorns to guard her bloom. Among the hungry, \"stranger\" and \"enemy\" are one word. From the rule of tooth and claw, fiery judgment rises. This is the fence about a mind that keeps away harm and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"confusion. This is the dark magick of the word \"NO \". The path of shin is an exercise of merciless w ill upon the perceptions of the physical senses. Only what seems to be human and helpful is allowed to ri se from the graveyard of earth. [FIGURE # 7: Same as # 6, but now add path 30.]  The Path of Resh  30  Yesod to Hod Yesod is a twilight world of many veils and so ft uncertainty. Night belongs to it, and night is a lurking place of frightful shadows. There is no sh arp edge to wound in Yesod, but neither is there healing sunlight. Mind searches for heads to top t he dreams and visions of this place. Each story must have a meaning. Each Astral journey must have one purpose. The path of Resh quests for rational value in the many mansions of the mysterious moon. Only simple and clear ideas are allowed to reach the lig ht of day. [FIGURE # 8: Same as # 7, but now add Hod, # 8]  The Sephira Hod  8 Hod is the Glory of the rationally awake. In a burning desert one cool oasis is paradise . Alone in such a place, anyone can be lord or lady. Within is a pool of clear water. Outside is a wall of fire to keep away danger. Stones are gathered from the desert in twilight to build a palace by th e pool. Trees provide fruit. Small animals hide in burrows and beneath fragrant shrubs. The master or the mistress of this place works solitary magick by turnings of the mind. From the path called \"Shi n\" bedouin riders bring flocks of analysis and synthesis to the oasis of reason. Caravans follow the track of Resh with precious loads of allegory and metaphor. The mercurial monarch of mind sets all i n self-consistent order, for that is the chief function of Hod. [FIGURE # 9: Same as #8, but now add p ath 29]  The Path of Qof  29 Malkut to Netzach There are soft things in the physical world. Not all is pain and violence. Mother's milk quickens."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Flowers glorify. On fruitful islands in warm seas, stranger is friend and friends work strange magick by the moon. The night of the earth is filled with things that cannot be seen. Some are deadly. Others are wonderful in their happy mysteries. The wise learn slowly how to tune nature's harp with soothing sounds for lovers and harsh pain for the h ated. This art draws up wisdom from the earth. [FIGURE # 10: Same as #9, but now add path 28]  The Path of Tzaddi  28  Yesod to Netzach In Yesod Alice wanders through Wonderland. Sh e follows Diana through the doors of twenty- eight mansions. Behind each door is a mystery. As she travels round the circuit she waxes and wanes with the moon. This child is near earning a woman' s girdle. By following the course of dream and legend, mind identifies with great forces. In time identification is close enough to insure a harmony between inner self and outer life. The Righteous o nes turn with the tendency of spirit. Fighters against the grain tire and are drawn up upon a ghos tly hook of half dreamt dreams. [FIGURE # 11: Same as #10, but now add path 29]  The Path of Peh  27  Hod to Netzach From a towering palace of isolated mind, a you th gazes. Hod is angry post puberty, know it all, and boredom. Bitterness grows in lonely places. A great mind waits for recognition only to find that others have no time. Far off the waxing light of V enus beckons. The dweller in the rational tower cries in anguish, still alone. A journey is attemp ted, but Venus remains unimpressed. Luna sometimes graces the brass parapet of Mercury's dom ain, but Venus wants the Sun or even Mars. Only when the dweller in the tower casts down the c rown of obstinate pride can the journey to higher consciousness be resumed. When a mind is ready to sacrifice its bachelor hood or spinsterhood and set aside some of its personal theories of how things work, that mind has set forth on the path of Peh. This is a clumsy time, often accompanied by falling in love with a m ore experienced person. It takes a lot to lure a self crowned queen or king from an ivory tower. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" [FIGURE # 12: Same as #11 but now add Netzach, 7]  The Sephira Netzach  7 Netzach is Victory of the wisdom of experience . A woman with brilliant red hair rides a giant shell upon green waves. She is living fire surrounded by loving water. This is one who has bl essed the world and in turn been blessed. The harshness of earth labors on her behalf. Dreams sp in secrets to delight her. The mighty invent new treasures to woo her. She fears not. She is not c onfused. She is free of bonds of her own making. This is the consciousness of one who learns th e lessons of the physical through turning to that turns to her or him. This consciousness delights i n the half real worlds called dreams. Reason serves this mind as a book serves a scholar or a throne a king. The consciousness of Netzach is a ship of emotional wealth upon an obedient sea of reason, im agination, and sensation. [FIGURE # 13: Same as #12 but now add path 26]  The Path of Ayin  26  Hod to Tipheret In dusty halls an earth bound spirit walks. I t cries aloud in anguish for the past. Ancient chains hinder its movements. This creature shudders at th oughts of lost love. Fear of hurt that did not happen, but could have been, binds this spirit. A mirror reflects the comic opera. Past webs of needless guilt and mold of wrong advice a spark of sunlight penetrates. The hero laughs and steps toward the sun. This is the path of letting go enough to grow. Old rules must be set aside in time. Such rules are scaffolding to be turn down after the building of t he Temple. Old fears are short safety lines that must be cut for further climbing. [FIGURE # 14: Same as #13 but now add path 25]  The Path of Samekh  25  Yesod to Tipheret Some people live a hundred lives but never liv e one. They have a job with its hours and ethics. They have a home with separate hours and ethics. R eligion has its own place. Dreams belong to the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"night. Physics is one thing but Magick something e lse. Neighbors are humans, but foreigners are wogs. Such people have a vocabulary but no grammar . They know thousands of definitions and fantasies, but they don't know how to weave one tap estry of all the threads they label. \"They\" is never \"You\". \"Them\" is never \"Us\". This is simple confusion. Be patient (that ha rdest and most valuable of virtues). A theme rises in the soul to unite all separate things. Sunlight is a new verb among old nouns. The path of Samekh is undertaken when dreams and ideas begin to harmonize consciously. [FIGURE # 15: Same as #14 but now add path 24]  The Path of Nun  24 Netzach to Tipheret In time a ship of Venus reaches shore. The so ul steps out and leaves its shell behind. This craft is not abandoned. It will remain in port until the ca ptain returns with better cargo. The soul of the ship glides past fields and gardens. In these gardens s eeds are buried in tiny braves. They rise as shoots to great the sun. When sound plants become golden, th ey are cut and carried off. Only the best return to earth to rise again. This soul goes beyond its earthly place to fin d better seed. The strongest life grows from a seed that's hybridized between growths of heaven and ear th. The best garden grows in the place of the sun. [FIGURE # 16: Same as #15 but now add Tipheret, 6]  The Sephira Tipheret  6 Tipheret is the beauty of the best place. A great gathering of happy people in a happy p lace. Long parted friends are reunited in the light of the sun. Enemies forget their enmity in the sea son of life. Merchants bring necklaces of stars and cloth of colors never seen before. The children la ugh, and no one frowns. The old cast off their age but keep their wisdom. Warriors play and women sin g. It's Fair, Althing, and Jubilee. All the scattered bits of life have come home. The burning desert is a beach beneath a tanning sun. The waters of the ocean cleanse all cares. Dreams spil l from storytellers' lips as history, laughter, and advice. The soul is shining with a golden light. It sees the course of life and knows purpose. All questions have a time for answers. All deeds have their place. Confusion is a spray of bubbles to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"tickle between knowing. Along the path of Ayin com e builders of the house. From Samekh the house holder comes. Nun provides skilled gardeners. Ord er serves mind with freedom. [FIGURE # 17: Same as #16 but now add path 23]  The Path of Mem  23  Hod to Geburah The builder returns to his castle of brass and discovers that he has neglected to ornament the ceilings. The roots of the castle are strong, but they are of earth. The roof of the castle is weak unless it mirrors celestial order. Accordingly, the build er reverses the direction of his thought. Hunting scenes, battles, pastoral gatherings, cities, and s hips ornament the walls. The upper vaults, high chambers and towers of this citadel must match the harmony of the spheres, the moral order of things, and those powers that dwell in lightning and beyond . Up goes thought along the channel of Mem, a ri ver that flows uphill. Mine seeks the things of mind and turns away from the body. The body shall not perish; so long as its needs are met below. [FIGURE # 18: Same as #17 but now add path 22]  The Path of Lamed  23 Tipheret to Geburah A shout disturbs the party. It's time to get down to business. Over the year many things have happened. Judgments are needed. Justice must be a dministrated. Old laws are to be revised and new ones proposed. The affairs of the community must b e examined and the best course planned for the coming year. Having found itself and rested, mind must prep are itself for future growth. Up to now conduct has been learned by trial and error. Ideals have come haphazardly. It's time to look at purposes and methods; time to set such things in order. The pat h of Lamed is discipline. [FIGURE # 19: Same as #18 but now add Geburah, 5]  The Sephira Geburah  5 Geburah is severity of understanding how. A soldier sits in judgment. He listens to the reports of spies. He hears petitions. A man offers"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"advice, and the soldier has him kicked out. This i s not the court of a merciful king. A tyrant sits here. His judgments are fire from a mind of ice. This tyrant is setting safeguards about an unprotected city. His will is a whip that makes th e dying march until some are saved. This soldier is not wrong. His hardness is like the heat that cook s food. It purifies, it improves, and it should disappear when it's done. Geburah is the place of fully developed and mo ral understanding. Hod is rational, defensive isolation. Geburah is rational, offensive caution. [FIGURE # 20: Same as #19 but now add path 21]  The Path of Koph  21  Netzach to Chesed Venus reaches down to the hinge of her shell t o check her charts. These are no common maps. They show all the riches of the world. Flights of birds and migrations of fishes are marked for the changes of the seasons. Currents in the sea and ai r are carefully indicated. An ephemeris lists the doings of the heavens so that Venus may set her cou rse. The turning of every wheel in heaven or on earth is noted somewhere. By learning the cycles o f things inside and outside, a soul can navigate the path of Koph toward Jovian riches. [FIGURE # 21: Same as #20 but now add path 20]  The Path of Yod  20  Tipheret to Chesed An old man leans on his staff and mutters. Hi s beard is filthy. His nose runs. He makes no sense. This old man has no manners. Hermits are away from other people too long. They forget how to behave. Most of the people at the fair ignore him or give a forced smile and quickly go some where else. These people are waiting for Mars to hear th eir petitions and judge their works. They are polite, even respectful; but they haven't time to listen. Some people aren't so busy. They are ready to hear the story of this ancient when he feels willing to speak. Later they learn that the old one is Mars' father and the master of them all. He leads them t o ideas that they never had before. An open mind grows toward Chesed along the path of Yod. A succe ssful person knows when to accept a hand. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" [FIGURE # 22: Same as #21 but now add path 19]  The Path of Tet  19 Geburah to Chesed Richard the Lion Hearted battles to protect th e Holy City from heathen and godless Saracen. He wonders why he has so little success. Troubled, he prays for guidance and falls asleep. The warrior dreams: A great red lion is striding across Europe and Asia. Everywhere there are jackals. When the lion kills, the jackals steal his prey. He roars a t them to stop, but they keep on. The lion grows hungry, then weak. He raises his paw to kill a wil d deer; his last dying effort. Before his eyes, the deer becomes Richard's mother. She wears the robes of a Saracen princess. Richard wakes up in a cold sweat. The next day he meets Saladin, learnin g in the process that Arabs had civilization and knew the Bible when the French and English were sti ll blue-assed barbarians. Richard and Saladin become friends. Truce comes and goes, but honor gr ows. Mars is often blind to the merits of his fello ws until wisdom opens his eyes. Moral consciousness needs to turn its hard judgments aside before it ex ceeds its purpose. Mercy is the wisdom of when to let up. [FIGURE # 23: Same as #22 but now add Chesed, 4]  The Sephira Chesed  4 Chesed is the mercy of providence. A calm figure sits in oriental splendor. Upon the figure's brow a bright star radiates soothing light. This is Mercy who bestows all needful things. The being is immortal. Death cannot take away what is not held. Those who attain past severity are am ong the saints. Chesed is a state of great peace. The mysteries of the lower worlds rise up to bow be fore the initiate of the greater, the path of Koph. Gentle seekers come to the feet of the teacher, the path of Yod. The master of the worlds below becomes a child to enter the presence, the path of Tet. Chesed is a giving up of all anxiety and all plans for changing the world. Such a release grant s the power to do anything desired, yet nothing is desired. Only ministering to others holds the sage to this place.

Extending from the right, a wavy line from just below Chokmah, horizontally above Da'at and stopping just before passing below Binah, labeled \"Paroket\" \"Abada\"]  Paroket, Abada and Da'at At times in a black night sky, a great veil de scends. Blue, purple and scarlet lights ripple. Fiery beings walk the sky. This is Aurora, the curtain a bout the throne of the Most High. Below is the Earth. Beyond is the Abode of greatest mystery. Before the Holy of Holies hangs Paroket. This veil is double, hung in two rows. The space before the outer is for ordinary worshipers. The Abyss, A bada, is between the two rows. Only those possessing Da'at, Knowledge, can pass Abada. Witho ut Da'at, Paroket is a double linen curtain; and the room beyond remains on earth. With fragments o f knowledge, dangerous passage can be made. One did it and died. Another did it and became mad . A third did it and became an atheist. A fourth passed Abada with great effort and returned to enli ghten the Chesidim. A fifth comes and goes at will, but the head of that one is in heaven while t he feet are in hell. Binah, Chokmah, and Keter are beyond the veil. Vision of them is sometimes granted, but mostly they must be found through lower things.  The Path of Chet  18  Geburah to Binah This is the way of Merkabah. One who can sust ain the might of Geburah, and who has touched Chesed, makes a meditative descent through seven in fernal palaces --- checks for personal flaws in the seven levels called Chesed, Geburah, Tipheret, Netz ach, Hod, Yesod, and Malkut. This meditation may be done in different ways, but it should be thr ough. According to legend, each of the infernal pala ces is held by an evil spirit, a personified vice opposite to the virtue of the corresponding Sephira . In Babylon of 3,000 or more years ago there was a belief in seven evil spirits. It's possible that the several different lists of seven tenants of the infernal mental palaces descended to us from Babylonian-Sume rian mythology: The South Wind that brings death. The Dragon whose great mouth is beyond meas ure. A grim Leopard which carries off the young (Lilit?). A terrible Shibbu. A fearless and furious Wolf. A rampant creature which marches against god and king. The evil Storm Wind of venge ance."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" After descent into this ancient inferno and co nfrontation of each vice, one ascends through seven purifying heavens. This is a return up to the leve ls of the lower Sephiroth. Finally the purified mind is able to rise up the path of Chet to the vision o f the shining veil of the throne chariot and beyond, the place of Binah. Another method of descent and return uses two forms of the Fifty Gates of Understanding. On the way down, seven faults are examined in each of the levels called Chesed, Geburah, Tipheret, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, and Malkut. In all, seven times seven or forty-nine mental questions must be answered during this descent. These are forty-nine \"gates\" which must be unlocked by possession of the \"keys,\"knowledge of right thought and conduct perti nent to each, and opened at the saying for the forty-nine \"passwords,\" declarations that one is fr ee of the corresponding vices. Very similar procedures are outlined in \"The Egyptian Book of th e Dead\", as translated by E.A.Wallis Budge and others. The form given in this Egyptian equivalent of Merkabah, called \"the negative confession\", is particularly useful. After the forty-nine gates ha ve been opened, the fiftieth gate, the Sephira Binah, opens; and passage across the Abyss become possible . The second form of the Fifty Gates of Binah is used on the way back up the Tree of Life. In this case, forty-nine gates are again passed, but as exp eriences of glory and increasing bliss instead of trial. The form of the ascension is different from that of the descent. Malkut, Yesod, and Tipheret are combined to form one composite Sephira. When this Sephira is taken with Hod, Netzach, Geburah, and Chesed, the whole Tree below the Abyss becomes a tree of five levels of consciousness instead of seven. Each of the five levels is subdivided into ten \"gates\" for a total of five times ten or fifty. It is this set of gates that is used by passage up to Bin ah. According to the Old Testament, the prophet Ez ekiel attained to the vision of the Merkabah, but Moses did not attain it at his death. It is said t hat those who fully attain the Merkabah do not die as other mortals but are taken up at the end of their days by the flaming Chariot of the Most High. The study of Merkabah is in some ways a Hebrew preparat ion for a perfect death, just as the Ancient Egyptians prepared for death with their own \"book o f the dead\" prayers and meditations. Many cultures have similar things. There is evidence th at the Coptic Christians considered the New Testament a \"book of the dead.\" Before returning to the description of the Tre e of Life, there is one more curious point about the Fifty Gates of Binah. The Hebrew letters each have number values. The letter having the value fifty"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"is Nun, to which the Order of the Golden Dawn attri buted the Tarot card \"Death\". This \"Death\" is not an end of existence but a great transformation of life into Life. The Tarot card \"The Chariot\" is attributed to the Hebrew letter Chet by the same gr oup. Many Jewish Qabalists distrust the work of Masonic Qabalists, but gold is gold even if it's so metimes gathered by the less learned. A digression before the Abyss is permitted. For a glimpse of Binah, examine your successes in attaining the consciousness levels of Chesed through Malkut. Practice these and rise above your best effort. The Path of Chet is the raising of Geburah pow er to the seat of all rational abstraction, the redirecting of mind, from attention to doing, to at tention to thinking. [FIGURE # 25: Same as #23 but now add paths 17 & 18]  The Path of Zain  17 Tipheret to Binah A gleaming sword is the path to paradise. It turns every way, and only those who walk the blade can pass from the land of day to understanding beyo nd night. This blade has ten points or turnings. Study of the ten Sephiroth unifies the mind. To ri se up the path of Zain, learn how to resolve all opposite qualities into unity. Unflinching determi nation to reach the source of all understanding brings consciousness from Tipheret to Binah. [FIGURE # 26: Same as #25 but now add Binah, 3]  The Sephira Binah  3 Binah is Understanding that reaches to the lim it of what can be rational. Above a great gray wall is a sky filled with d ark clouds. This sky is alive and can see. The blind wall sinks by concentration of mind, and more senti ent sky shows. Beyond the gray wall is a vast black sea of waters from before the creation of the would. Not all the science of the world can make that wall descend more than a few inches. The mind of the greatest mathematician who ever existed can only cause it to lower a fraction more. No mor tal mind can force the gray wall down to the level of the great sea. Yet all the Understanding that i s Binah is at the bottom of that sea, that great black womb of all the worlds. The whole understanding of humanity is only mist above the wall.

The iris is gray. The outer orb is black, not white. About the eye are all col ors of the rainbow in concentric circles. This is the eye that sees all. The eyes of the earth are eyes of destruction. When an earthly eye gazes, it sees what is outside and grants the power to change the world. The eye of Keter sees the world into existence. Before this eye looks, Nothing exists. The black eye of the world is a camera that takes in what it sees. The white eye beyond the world is a projector that produces what it sees. Earthly eyes are forever changing one vision for another, but th is eye of creation sees all places, times, and directions as one. Keter is unity beyond even the questions of difference.

Ac cording to legend, the world was created by a sword issuing out of the mouth of the creator. Thi s sword flashed nine lights before its tip became the Earth. The hilt of the sword remains in the mouth of the Creator to sustain the existence of the Universe. Nothing can be known of this hilt, so it is named \"Ain\", \"Nothing\". The first light on the sword is white. This is called \"Keter\", \"Crown\", t he principle of unity. The second light is gray. This is \"Chokmah\", \"Wisdom\", the principle of duali ty and the spiritual paradise called \"Eden\". The third \"light\" is black, a positive or knowable sort of darkness in contrast to the unknown darkness of the hilt. It is called \"Binah\", \"Understanding\", t he principle of return to unity, trinity. This is the paradise called \"Gan Eden\", the Garden of Eden. Ac cording to Genesis myth, the creation would have stopped there if the first humans had not caus ed its continuation.

There are two kinds of Da'at. The upper Da'at is the light of Keter, Chok mah, and Binah, the knowledge of spiritual existence.

Nothing new could be done, only a duplication of th e first extension was possible. This was done. Just as the first extension of the sword produced t hree lights and a root at the tip, the further extension produced two more triads of lights and a resting pl ace at the tip. The first triad, Keter, Chokmah, and Binah, became reflected in an opposite tirad: Chese d, the blue light of Mercy. Geburah, the Red light of Severity. Tipheret, the yellow light of Beauty. A third triad of lights matched the third of the lights of the first triad: Netzach, the green light of Victory. Hod, the orange light of Glory. Yesod, the violet light of Foundation. The tip of the new ly extended sword then gave out a tenth, dull light of all the earthly colors. This last light became Mal kut, the Kingdom of physical existence. Because the tip of the sword had moved from it s position in the upper triad, the dark light of Da'at was gone from its place. This light spread itself through all the lower seven lights. There can be no return to paradise until the s cattered light of Da'at is reestablished. This can be done by climbing the lower Tree and gathering light (knowledge) from each of the seven Sephiroth. Once that is done, the three lights of the higher T ree can be reached. The Da'at of the lower Tree shall join the upper Da'at. By the combined knowle dge of the part above with that below, the creating sword can be withdrawn or extended at human will. [FIGURE # 39: To Figure #38, add the tradition al 22 paths as thin lines and mark them with the Hebrew letters] After ten lights flashed from the creating swo rd, secondary lights or rays sprang between them. These rays are the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the paths of light that join the Sephiroth and the limbs of the Tree. The Sephiroth can be re ached through careful learning of these secondary lights. Humanity was exiled to the lowest light, M alkut, and could only learn through the things of that light: Lifeless matter, Plants, and Animals. The stones and other dead things possess only enough light to glow softly where they are. Their spirit is great in the power of remaining and possessing form, but these dead things can at most be houses for wandering souls and great mountains that reach upward over millions of years. The plan ts have higher spirit and can grow in thousands of years to resemble the Tree of Life itself. From pl ants, humanity learned the shape and the placement of the ten Sephiroth. The animals have nearly huma n spirit and grow in hundreds of years. Animals"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"have the power to move quickly like the twenty-two lesser lights. At first, even the skill of the animals at mov ing quickly was not enough. Humans could imitate the different animals and learn a little about some of the lesser lights near the Earth, but there was no connecting these lesser lights with each other. Th ere was no memory. Tracks left by most animals are separate marks. A serpent showed the way. Whe n a serpent climbs a tree, it can move and bend its body over many limbs at one time. The track of a serpent is long and continuous. Other animals make similar marks with their tails; but when they go a little way they look back over the track of their tail, become happy and wag their tail. This breaks the trail and causes loss of memory. The serpent cannot break its track through over excitem ent or pride in accomplishment. The serpent, then, is the model for climbing u p the twenty-two lesser lights of the Tree of Life. By twisting and turning thought about on the Tree, a h uman mind can reach the heights of spirit and return to matter at will. [FIGURE 40: Full page.

There are four criteria for associating the pa rts of the human body to the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Written traditions are obtained from the \"Bibl e\", \"Sepher Yetzirah\", \"Sepher Ha-Zohar\", and several other sources. Oral or informal traditions ascribe different meanings to the organs and limbs of the body."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Geometrical limitations may be imposed to acco mmodate a particular way of drawing the Tree. Medical knowledge of the body may lead to asso ciation of body parts to the Tree. Over the centuries there have been many differ ent placements of the human body on diagrams or in descriptions of the Tree of Life. Some people a rgue quite hotly that one method is \"true\" and others are \"false.\" Such a rigid view is unnecessary. An y well thought out association to the Tree of Life is useful and worth study. An association that meets all four criteria perfectly would have a claim to being called \"best,\" but some of the criteria for a ssociating the body to the Tree are exclusive of others. The heart, for example, is a center of rational tho ught in several traditions; but it is a center for physical strength and body vitality in the view of western medicine. The former criterion would associate the heart with Binah (3); while the latte r would associate the heart with Tipheret (6), Geburah (5), or even Malkut (10). Traditions about the heart as the seat of love would grant it to Chesed (4), Tipheret (6), or Netzach (7). As the s ource of all physical body energy, the heart can be assigned to Yesod. As the center of physical exist ence, the heart is Malkut. As the uniting organ, the heart belongs to Keter. Furthermore, it is possibl e to associate some aspect or function of the heart to every one of the twenty-two lesser paths of the Tre e. Similar multiple associations are found with the other body parts. The Tree of Life derives much of its value as an archetypal pattern from the fluid way that associations to it change. The Tree is be yond any way of describing it in the same way a king is beyond his titles. There is an inner essen ce that can be outwardly described in many different ways. If this were not so, a little study would le arn the Tree and make it a limited tool instead of a way of continually growing in mind and spirit. Whe n one view of the Tree is understood, change something and see another mystery unfold. A few methods for ascribing parts of the human body to the Tree of Life seem to satisfy most of the obvious criteria. These methods are like the tools people use to repair things. A few tools are good for a lot of jobs; a claw hammer with a screwdriver in the handle is such a tool. If a lot of work is to be done, the multipurpose tools tend to be awkward and specialized tools are better, e.g. several sizes and types of hammers and screwdrivers. When beginn ing meditation on the Tree of Life, it is best to have a general purpose body meditation. For very p articular purposes, such as using the Tree of Life to understand a particular function or condition of the human body or mind, it is best to use more specialized associations to the Tree. In the meditation presented here, the four cri teria are ranked thusly:"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Geometrical as most important. To simplify the rea ding of this book, the most popular diagram of the Tree of Life, the Kircher Tree, has been used a s often as possible. Other ways of depicting the Tree are to be found among the books listed in the Bibli ography. Luria, Rosenroth, Regardie, Case, Achad, Crowley and Ponce show many variations. Lynn Powel l has written and lectured about a design based on the \"Sepher Yetzirah\". When a human figure is p laced on a Kircher Tree, the limbs, major organs, etc. line up near the Sephiroth in the manner given here. Written tradition from the \"Sepher Ha-Zohar\" g ives the second set of criteria. The \"Zohar\" mostly agrees with the associations used here, but much of what is assigned to the left side of the human body in the \"Zohar\" has been switched to the right side here and vice versa. The effect of this reversal is to make the human figure look out from an illustration of the diagram instead of present his backside. Aside from esthetics, an outward facing figure meet s some of the medical criteria a little better. If the other left-right convention is preferred, all that is necessary is to replace the word \"right\" with the word \"left\" and vice versa throughout the meditation. The medical criteria are taken third. The fee t support the body for Malkut. The sexual organs produce children; and, through glandular chemistry, influence dreams --- Yesod. Hips link the feet to the rest --- Hod and Netzach. The heart is more or less in the center of the body --- Tipheret. The shoulders link the arms to the rest --- Geburah and Chesed. The right hand is usually stronger than the left --- Geburah on the right. The heart is usuall y (but not always!) on the left side of center, so Chesed (Mercy) to the left. The throat and mouth fashion speech --- Da'at is knowledge, and speech is the primary form of communication of knowledge (writing is visible speech). The brain is the seat of rational and emotional consciousness in the body -- - Binah and Chokmah. The speech center is usually on the left side of the brain, and that is a flaw i n the association. The mental activity of Binah (here associated to the right side) should include contro l of speech. Rationalization says: \"To raise consciousness, develop a speech center on the right half of the brain. Use the full potential of the brain.\" For those who don't wish to rationalize, turn the h ead to the right on the Tree. That associates the rational functions to Binah in the forebrain and th e more mysterious functions of the midbrain and brain stem to Chokmah. Oral and informal traditions have mostly been ignored here. They tend to relate to more specialized uses of the Tree. Color visualization."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" People who haven't used paints or other colori ng materials recently may have trouble visualizing colors. There's a simple way to fix that. Color a diagram of the Tree. The best medium for beginners is colored pencils or marking pens. Water colors are a little more versatile (Winsor & Newton Designers Gouache was used by the G.'. D.'.), while acrylic t ube colors are both bright and easy to use. Cut-outs from colored paper are very difficult to match to t he desired shades unless a Pantone sample set is used. Embroidery is slow, but the various brands of six-s trand floss come in so many colors that a good match is possible: Path 1 --- DMC Blanc Neige. Path 2 -- - JPC # 71 Puter Gray.

Adapted from \"Thelema Lodge Calendar\", December 1989 issue. Proper pronunciation of the words for the seve ral parts of the Tree of life requires some effort. There are two common methods for pronouncing Hebrew, the Ashkenazic or German style and the Sephardic or Spanish style. The suggestions given below are for Sephardic pronunciation. Sephardic is closer to ancient Hebrew than is Ashkenazic. THE MOST COMMON NAMES OF THE SEPHIROTH : 0.

Each path has the letter name with vowel points written along it.] THE DIVINE NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SE PHIROTH Eheieh, HB:AHYH, the divine name of Keter, the first Sephira. This is the \"I Am\" part of the name told to Moses d uring the vision of the burning bush: Exodus 3; 14. E-he-ye --- First E like in met. Second e like the first e in believe. Third e like in met. Accent the first syllable. Yah, HB:YH, the divine name of Chokmah, the se cond Sephira. This is a short form of the name \"Jehovah\" or \"Yahweh\". The name \"Yah\" appears in many places in the Bible. Yah --- a like in father. Alternatively: Yoh --- o like in born. Yahweh Elohim, HB:YHVH ALHYM, the divine name of Binah, the third Sephira. The first part, Yahweh, is also pronounced \"Jehovah\" and a number o f other ways. This first part is the Tetragrammaton, the Great Name of four letters. We ll supported tradition says that this name has a secret pronunciation that was known only by the Hig h Priest of the Temple at Jerusalem and his successors. The tradition further holds that the p ronunciation of this Shem, or divine name, was lost during the destruction of the Temple. There are se veral less well attested traditions that the pronunciation of Tetragrammaton has been preserved secretly to the present day. This name has several standardized pronunciations with many minor variati ons. The form for Yahweh used here is pronounced wi th the aid of vowels from Elohim. The other major variation uses vowel pointing from Adonai. When th e Elohim vowels are used, the result is represented in English by \"Yahweh\". The Adonai form is often s pelled \"Jehovah\" in English. The Adonai form means, with minor variation in sound, \"He Is\" or \"S he Is\". The Elohim form can mean: \"He is\", \"She is\", \"He Creates\", or \"She Creates\" --- depending o n minor variations in pronunciation. Vowel pointing used in the illustration below forces the meaning \" He Creates\". If the vowel point \"Seghol\" is replaced with the vowel point \"Qamas Qatan\" the pronunciatio n changes slightly and the meaning becomes \"She Creates.\" This is a variation in the handling of t he last letter. Some sources leave the final Heh silent, while others put a dot called \"Mapiq\" inside the le tter so that it will be pronounced (when a dot appears in the center of other letters, it is called a \"Dag hesh\", and has a different effect. Heh never takes the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Daghesh. Mapiq indicates that the Heh is a consona nt, otherwise it acts as a vowel. Daghesh either may indicate that a letter is doubled in pronunciat ion or that it takes aspirate pronunciation. Daghesh only doubles letters following short vowels.) In t he variations given here for pronunciation, Mapiq has been used. Yahweh (Jehovah) is the most frequently used divine name in the Torah. Yahweh, meaning \"He Is\" --- Ye-Veh --- Both e' s like in met. V like w in wind. Yahweh, meaning \"She Is\" --- Ye-Voh --- e like in met. o like in born. Yahweh, meaning \"He Creates\" --- Ya-He-Veh --- a like in bard. First e like first e in believe. Last e like in met. Yaweh, meaning \"She Creates\" --- Ya-He-Voh --- a like in bard. e like first e in Be lieve. o like in born. Elohim, the second part of the Binah divine na me, has only one Sephardic pronunciation; but there are unusual complications with the meaning of this name. Most English translations of the Old Testament render \"Elohim\" as \"God\". This oversimpl ifies the meaning and hides a strong suggestion of polytheism under bland monotheism. Elohim is a plu ral form of Eloh. Eloh means \"Goddess\" --- it is a feminine singular noun for the Deity. The suffix \" -im\" is the plural ending used for most masculine nouns. If the word Elohim occurred only once in th e Bible, this combination of a masculine plural with a feminine singular noun would easily be dismissed as a copier's error. Elohim, however, is used to represent the deity in more that 30% of the divine namings in the Bible. Only Yahweh/Jehovah is used more often. Elohim is also the first divine name u sed in Genesis (First chapter, first verse, third word in the Hebrew). The obvious conclusion regarding the spelling of this name is that the oddity of its meaning is intentional. Orthodox Jewish and Christian argument tries t o dismiss the plural meaning of Elohim by saying that a plural can mean \"great\" and need not mean \"m ore than one\". In support of this, the orthodox note that kings, emperors, presidents and popes often re fer to themselves as \"We\" (\"We order...\", \"We believe...\", etc.). Authors and teachers occasiona lly use the plural to represent themselves or their \"professional opinion.\" This support fails on ana lysis. The plural applied to one person often means that one person is speaking for his colleagues (a t eacher, author, or monarch speaking for other teachers, authors, or monarchs). Another use of the plural f or one person is intended to place that person in a tradition or historic line (When a king says \"We\" h e may be saying \"I am now speaking as the current monarch of this royal house. The other monarchs of this royal house would say the same thing if they"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"were still alive.\"). In Roman times, the plural wa s often used to mean that a famous person shared his fame with his family and that his name would be mul tiplied through the generations. Sometimes the plural has been used to refer to one person's virtu es or faults. When a human being is believed to have a familiar spirit, genus or spiritual inspiration, th e plural is often applied to the combination. In every case the use of the plural for one person refers di rectly or indirectly to some multiple aspect and not to one individual alone. The use of a word meaning \"G oddess\" as the basis of Elohim greatly complicates any attempt to dismiss the plural ending on this na me. A few Christians have suggested that Elohim re presents the divine trinity of \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\" \"Eloh\" represents the feminine Holy Spiri t; while the plural masculine ending \"-im\" represents the Father and the Son. A simpler theory says that the Elohim are angels who perform the work of creation at the direction of Yahweh-Jehovah. The l atter view is supported by frequent appearance of Jehovah (or Yahweh) Elohim in the Bible. When thes e two words are in combination, it is usual to pronounce Yahweh Hehovah as Jehovah. This adds the vowels of Adonai to a divine name using Elohim. For general use of this pair of divine nam es, that's good. For use of these two names as a compound name for the Sephira Binah, it is better t o use the vowels of Elohim for the Tetragrammaton. The pronunciation then follows the Yahweh Elohim st yle and allows for a meaning, \"He (or She) creates gods and goddesses.\" Elohim --- Elo-Him --- E as in met but shorter . o as in bore.  i as in police. Last s yllable louder. El, HB:AL, the divine name of Chesed, the fort h Sephira. This is a name of many meanings, but the most basic are: \"god\" and \"might\". The English wor d \"all\" is like this divine name both in spelling and in meaning. When the letters of El are reversed (L amed-Aleph instead of Aleph- Lamed), La results. La means \"nothing\". This property of reversal of mean ing on reversal of spelling is common to a number of divine names and mystical terms in Hebrew. A si milar thing in English is the reversal of the letters of \"God\" to give \"dog\". El occurs in many places i n the Bible. Jehovah-Yahweh is sometimes called \"Ha-El\", \"the God\". Predictions concerning the Messiah sometimes use El. El is often used to refe r to gods other than hose of the People of Israel. El --- E as in met. Elohim Gibor, HB:ALHYM GBVR, the divine name o f Geburah, the fifth Sephira. The meaning of this double name, taking a polytheistic view of Elo him, is \"gods and goddesses are mighty\". A similar double name, El Gibor, is used in Isaiah 10:21."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Elo-Him Gib-Bor --- E as in met but shorter. Both o's as in bore.  First i as in police. S econd i like in bit. Jehovah Eloh Va-Da'at, HB:YHVH ALVH V-Da'aTh, the divine name of Tipheret, the sixth Sephira. Because Jehovah-Yahweh is a part of this name, ther e are several possible meanings and pronunciations. In the case of Tipheret, the Jehovistic pronunciati ons are prefered over the Yahwistic. Jehovah is pronounced with the aid of vowel points from the di vine name Adonai. A tradition exists which relates Adonai to Tipheret and also to Malkut, the tenth Se phira. If Jehovah is pronounced with the Adonai vowels so that the meaning is \"He Is\", this is the method: Ye-Ho-Vah --- e like first in believe. o like in bore. v like English w. a like in fat her. Accent last. To provide a meaning \"She Is\", nearly the same vowel points are used; but the last one, Qamas Gadol, is replaced by Qamas Qatan. The resulting change in sound is hardly detectable in Ashkenazic pronunciation, but there is a distinct change in Sephardic: Ye-Ho-Voh --- e like first in believe. First o like in bore. v like English w. Last o like i n born. Accent last. Eloh can bean either \"God\" or \"Goddess\", but t he spelling strongly disposes toward \"Goddess\" as the correct meaning. There is reason to believe that t his word originally meant only \"Goddess\", while El was the masculine form. \"God\" as a meaning for Elo h may have come into fashion as a way of avoiding the problem of the meaning Elohim. Eloh is pronoun ced: Elo-Ha --- E like in met but shorter. o like in bore. a like in bard. Accent last syllab le. (To somewhat stress the feminine me aning, change the Syllables to El-Oh and omit the \"a\" sound.) The last part of the Tipheret name is Va-Da'at , \"and knowledge\". Ve-Da-at --- e like first e in believe. Both s's like in bard, but see the note above on \"Da'at\" for the necessary glottal stop. Middle syllable ac cented. Jehovah Tzabaot, the divine name of Netzach, t he seventh Sephira. Jehovah- Yahweh again complicates the pronunciation. The recommended met hod for the Tetragrammaton in this case is the same for the Tipheret name: \"He is\" --- Ye-Ho-Vah, or \"She is\" --- Ye-Ho-Voh. The strong link between Jehovah and Adonai goes beyond sharing vowe l points. The Orthodox Jews usually say \"Adonai\" in place of \"Jehovah\" when reading the Tet ragrammaton aloud. English translations often render Jehovah as \"Lord\" --- the proper translation of Adonai. This practice is explained as a showing of respect for Jehovah. Various other words are oc casionally substituted: Dodi, HB:DVDY, \"Loving One\", replaces Jehovah in some books. This euphemi sm has a similar appearance to the four letters of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the proper word. A rare substitution for Jehovah i s Jehovat, HB:YHVTh. Elohim is occasionally said in place of Yahweh. Ha-Shem, HB:H-ShM, \"The Name\", is often used. This tendency to euphemise names for the divinity has passed into English. Ma ny Jewish writers spell \"God\" as \"G-d\". Tzabaot usually means \"hosts\" or \"large number s of soldiers\", but this word may also mean \"splendors\", \"beauties\", or \"gazelles\". Tse-Ba-Ot --- e like first in believe. a like in father. o like in bore. Accent third sy llable. Jehovah Tzabaot is usually translated as if it were Adonai Tzabaot, \"Lord of Armies\" or \"Lord of Hosts\"; but it literally means \"He (She) is a Great Host\" or \"He (She) is a Multitude of Splendors\". Elohim Tzabaot, HB:ALHYM TzBAVTh, the divine n ame of Hod, the eighth Sephira. Taking the polytheistic meaning for Elohim, this name can mean either \"Gods and Goddesses are a Host\" or \"Gods and Goddesses are Splendors.\" See above for pronun ciation of the two components of this name. Shaddai El Chai, HB:ShDY AL ChY, the divine na me of Yesod, the ninth Sephira. This, like the divine name given below for Malkut, is a composite of several names that usually appear separately. Shaddai means \"mighty\" or \"The Almighty\"; and, when it appears separately, Qabalists say it represents Metatron, the angel of the Covenant and Prince of the Face of the Most High. El is a name of the divinity in its own right, but with Shaddai, it has a special meaning. Shaddai El or El Shaddai means \"Almighty God.\" By the Qabalistic practice of Gema tria, a sort of numerology, the numerical value of El Shaddai is 345, the same value obtained by conve rting the letters of the name Mosha (Moses) to number. Some authors have not made this distinctio n between Shaddai and El Shaddai. Mathers, in his pseudo translation and commentary on \"The Key of So lomon the King\" (also called \"The Greater Key of Solomon\") describes a magical talisman of the Sun a s representing Metatron. The inscription on this talisman is El Shaddai and the face shown is a trad itional representation of Moses with horns of light.

The meditation given in this section uses four sets of correspondences to the thirty-two parts of the Tree of Life, as well as several to the ten Sephiro th. These include names of Hebrew letters and Sephiroth, colors, parts of the body and brief desc riptions fro the thirty-two paths. It is sometimes difficult to relate to particular sets of correspon dences, so it's good to have extras for meditation and for study. A few more tables of correspondences are li sted below. Many others can be found in \"777\", a book written by Aleister Crowley. These tables and the ones in \"777\" are in a di fferent order than the Tree Meditation, but the key numbers are the same as the path numbers used in th e meditation. To help with the use of these correspondences, the first table given below will r epeat the names of the Sephiroth and Letters that were used in the meditation. There are variations in some of these sets of correspondences to the Tree of Life. Like the attribution of body parts to the Tree, different sets of Astrol ogical, Tarot and other correspondences exist. All are valuable, but some seem to work better at first tha n others. The Tarot and Astrological correspondences given here are from the tradition of the Order of t he Golden Dawn. The planets have often been differently listed. Association of stones, plants and other object s to the parts of the Tree goes by affinity or \"signature\". Colors, surface patterns and other physical charact eristics remind one of the various parts of the Tree of Life. Sometimes a mythological story will override appearance for a particular stone or other object. Such associations are not to be taken rigidly. The set of corresponding books is very loose. There is something in each of these that matches a Path on the Tree, but there is more that wanders ab out.

There are many ways to use the Tree in times o f mental or emotional crisis. One of the methods involves a search for \"Qliphot\", shells. According to one of several traditions about qlipot, there is an upside-down image of the the Tree of Life in Malkut -- a sort of Tree of Death. The Thirty-two paths of the Tree of Life are all positive in terms of their influence and function; but, if a path is incorrectly used, the \"light\" of the path on the Tree of Life fades a nd consciousness may be tricked by the corresponding shell on the Tree of Death. It is then necessary t o discover the fault and raise fallen consciousness back to the Tree of Life. Such falls to the qliphot usu ally result from a misapplication of power -- for example; the moral judgments that belong to Geburah are too abstract to be directly applied to individual persons or actions. The moral theory of Geburah mu st be tempered by the lower parts of the Tree before use in Malkut. It may be right to say; \"Needless k illing is bad.\" But it is not right to say \"John Smith is bad,\" if you know John Smith as a person. \"Needless killing is bad.\" -- Geburah idea. \"John Smith is bad.\" -- a mistaken attempt to apply Geburah level thought without modification at Hod. One may find it necessary to do something about John Smith to st op his needless killing, but that is not a moral decision -- it's self-defense."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" The symptoms of a qliphothic state include: A nger that has not immediate physical object. Fits of depression. Pains without physical cause. Feeling s of loneliness in the presence of people. Boredom -- generally any negative state of mind and emotion th at has no simple explanation. Different people would go about self-analysis in different ways, but here's a written example of such an examination conducted by the Author on himself a few decades ago: \"March 20th, 1973. Diagnostic speculations on progress. Comprehension of Sephirot and Paths.\" \"Activity; Tipheret -- hard to hold to. Currently t end to move toward Geburah and instead fall from T ipheret. Netzach -- mostly held, but deficiencies in some details. Needs more work on path 24. Paths 28 and 29 are fully functional but tend to be overr idden by recurrent problems between 24 and 25; 6, 5 and 8. Hod -- fully functional but not fully con trolled. Failure of reach to Geburah causes fall to hod and recurrence of old problems. Attempts to do G eburah work with Hod mental tools are engendering Ql iphotic activity in Malkut and undermining Yesod -- results in a fall to the Qliphotic Tree.\" \"Qliphotic experience: This is not an 'inverted tree' in the sen se that it must be climbed up to the regular Tree of Life. This is a 'turned- inside-out' version of the regular Tree o f Life. Qliphot result from improper use of the regular Tree. T his is nothing more than breakdown through improper activity. The cause is an attempt to work problems on higher levels than those appropriate to the nature of the problems. Results that sho uld be immediate are blocked. The evils attendant on such fru stration all stem from descent of the Tree under the illusion th at the Tree is being ascended. The instant that the actual st atus -- descent to a lower level -- is recognized and accepted , the Qliphotic Tree vanishes and the Tree of Life is reinstat ed. Climb to the point just before the earlier failure is almost automatic.\" \"Description of Subjective Experience.\" \"Tiphereth -- Sense of harmony and good order. No problems. All is mellow. All work proceeds smoothly. Alc ohol doesn't produce much hangover. All experiences are benef icial.\" \"Attempt Geburah -- Greater powers of action f rom Tipheret consciousness tempt toward control. Visi on of Tipheret is not clear enough. It must grow. Tried Gebur ah controls of house. Some success. Geburah activity of minor key partly successful along path 22, but path 23 not functional enough -- drugs like alcohol open the path, but the path close s when they wear off. This results in a downward drift. Gebura tic tasks attempted from Hod produce anger -- this is poison to th e whole Tree. Geburah anger is good -- merely hot compulsion on externals. Hod anger can work well only on Yesod and Malkut -- this type of anger fails when applied to Netzach by path 27. This failure produces"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" more trouble until it is corrected. Para noia results. Hatred enters. This is Qliphotic.\" \"Recovery -- proceeds through analysis and the ory of the nature of Hod. Desire to correct the problem of ha tred-paranoia draws up consciousness to Netzach. Tipheret emerg es with an overview (this analysis). Consolidation of the wh ole problem results from this overview.\" \"Progress and overview: Malkut -- functional. Yesod -- functional. Hod -- functional. Netzach -- functional, but requires watch ing. Tipheret -- beginning functional. Geburah -- slightly functional. Chesed -- functional but not always conne cted to the lower Sephirot. This result is high purpose, but actions tend not to fit purpose. Da'at -- Tipheret-Yesod-Malkut not ready to link to this state. Da'at fully functional between Chesed and Binah, but not able to be active below Che sed. Binah -- Fully functional but does not li nk below Chesed. Chokmah -- Same as Binah. Keter -- Same as Binah. The connecting paths: 32 to 28 are functional. 27 functions with occasional trouble . 26 functions, but can overload with negative emotion. 25 functions only during balanced em otional times and during introspection. 24 is growing functional, but can't handle an overload without support from the lower paths. 23 functions only with the help of e xcitement, alcohol and such things. 22 snaps open rarely. 21 is usually closed, but leaks a li ttle function now and then. 20 and 19 are like 21. 18 through 11 are some opening and s ome fully functioning, but not through to the lower le vels.\" -- Next time it was better [FIGURE # 58:  * * * * * "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" * * * * * * *  * *************************************************** ********************** BIBLIOGRAPHY: Pending.
