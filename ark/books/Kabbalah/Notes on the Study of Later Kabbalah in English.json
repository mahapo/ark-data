[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Notes on the Study of Later Kabbalah in English The Safed Period and Lurianic Kabbalah Don Karr [The original version of this paper appeared in Collected Articles on the Kabbalah , vol. 2. by D. Karr (Ithaca: KoM #6, 1985): pp. 23-31] The small Galilean town of Safed flourished in the sixteenth century as a center of Jewish ideals and spirituality in all of their expressions: law, ethics, philosophy, and mysticism. This community was home to great teachers and thinkers whose works and ideas have become some of the most influential in all of Judaism. Isaac Luria (1534-72) was one of these dominant figures. Though he wrote very little himself, his developments of the Kabbalah, primarily as recorded by his chief disciple Hayyim Vital, shaped later Kab- balism and, ultimately, Hasidism. Quoting Gershom Scholem, The Lurianic Kabbalah was the last religious movement in Judaism the influence of which became preponderant among all sections of Jewish people and in every country of the diaspora, without exception. – Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , page 285-6 (3 rd edition, London: Thames and Hudson, 1955) Moses Cordovero (1522-70), Luria’s senior contemporary, was a late exponent of the classical Kabbalah. A prolific writer, Cordovero succeeded in systematizing a vast and disparate body of kabbalistic lore. Other luminaries of the great Safed period include Joseph Karo (1488-1575), the renowned legalist whose codification of Jewish law, Shulan Arukh , is authoritative to this day, and Elijah de Vidas, author of the popular kabbalistic ethical treatise, Reshith Hokhmah . It should be noted at the outset that there is a woeful lack of translated material from this period. For example, we have not seen either of Cordovero’s major works, Elimah Rabbati and Pardes Rimmonim , in English. Lurianic works, such as those compiled by Hayyim Vital, have been finding their way into English in recent years, but these renderings are far from complete. © Don Karr, 1985, 1995; updated 2002-4 Ema il: dk0618@yahoo.com All rights reserved.
