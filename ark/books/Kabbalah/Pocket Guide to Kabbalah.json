Buy and read the Way of Kabbalah by Zev ben Shimon Halevi 2. Refer to the Zohar and books by Gershom Scholem for the traditional aspects 3. Most modern books on Kabbalah have identical content – take your pick 4. Decide if you wish to work alone or in the company of others 5. Learn the names, attributions and correspondences, even if they mean little to begin with 6. Apply everything, see everything in relationship to the model you are learning 7. Practice analysis and synthesis of other systems (i.e. Tarot) using the Tree as a guide 8. Learn symbology, particularly biblical (see Geoffry Hodson) 9. Discuss with others – Kabbalah is an oral tradition 10. When you are ready, practice letter permutation meditations (see Kaplan) Notes Kabbalah is a most incredibly rich system and is truly a life’s work. It suits some but not others, and is open to speculative (practical) as well as purely intellectual approaches. Using the Tree of Life diagram and the idea of the four worlds can reveal hidden patterns in the Universe and in one’s own psyche (as well as in everyday life) with alarming clarity. Indeed, coincidence is the communication method of the Tree! Practising Kabbalah is important, applying it to everyday life and systems. It is a difficult system to learn in that you have to learn it piecemeal whilst remembering that it is a holistic system and parts can only truly be comprehended in relation to the whole. In Real Life ... I once mapped dressmaking onto a Tree of Life diagram, from the point of conception (Kether) to the final garment (Malkuth) and in doing so, opened up what became a years worth of further study and appreciation of the Tree! Application of the system and discussion of findings can open up the Tree immensely. Any creative act follows the Sephiroth of the Tree through the Lightning Flash and any progressive act follows the Paths upwards. Using Tarot as pictorial devices to represent the Paths can be extremely useful. I haven’t found many modern books useful as they tend to cover the same ground in the same format, but the simplicity of Halevi’s works and the depth of Kaplan’s are worth pursuing.
