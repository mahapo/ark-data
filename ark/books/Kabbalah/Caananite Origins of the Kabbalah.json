[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Caananite Origins of the Kabbalah To find the true origins of the cabala, we have to find the origins of humanity. The Traditon says tha t God himself reveal the cabala to Adam after his fall when Adam finally felt arepented and pray god for forgiveness . For many times scholars consider Egypt to be the ol dest civilization, many occult olders start to look to Egypt as the mother of the occult sciences, an many claim to hav e a direct lineage to the Egyptian hermetist. But today we know better. The Egyptian aren’t the o ldest civilization. The Summerians are. The anthrop ologist found this after noticing the strange name of some pharaohs, this name weren’t egiptian in nature, it seems they were in and older language, and older civilization had t o existed before the egiptians, this culture was th e Summerian. Today we use terms like Babylonian, Sumerian an Cha ldean as synonyms, this is because they are essenti ally the same culture on different periods of time, after se veral wars between the city-states, invations , mix ture of cultures and shift of power, the summerians turn into de Aca dians the Acadians into Assyrians, the Assyrians in to Babylonians and the Babylonians into Chaldeans. We have to kept in mind that if this groups represent different mixtures of races, they all share the same territor y, Mesopotamia, the land between the two rivers Tig ris and Euphrates. Beyond this two revers, perhaps where no w the Persian Golf is located, two missing rivers i rrigate the Land of Eden, the Biblical paradise. Before the Summerians there is no other civilizatio n because they where all swift out by the Great Flo od. Elena Petrova Blavatsky says about the Summerians being t he sixth sub-raze of fourth raze, Atlantis. The fif th sub-race where the Semites. Today it is known that many of t he story told on the Book of Genesis are a Jewish v ersion of olders storys told by the Summerians, so yes there is a Summerian Noah, if there is a Summerian Noah, could it be a Summerian Cabalah? Whele the tradition says that after the Great Flood god teach the Cabalah to Noah and to the most righ teous mens on every generation. So our chances are very High. A detail that many people do not know is that the H ebrew and Greek alphabet were adaptations of and ol der alphabet today call Phoenician. The cabala is all c entered on the 22 letter alphabet and let face it, without this alphabet they would be no cabala. Now, who where this Phoenicians inventors of the al phabet? Well the Phoenicians is the people who lived on the South of Summer, the where very skill people on th e art of navigation, merchants who would travel the whole kn own world to exchange goods. They also share their alphabet with the whole humanity and it appear that they eve n travel and discover America in that remote time. They are the same people call in the Bible as the Caananites, is just that the anthropologist use the term Phoenici ans to describe their culture during the bronze age, but this is a name the roman empire use to describe them, the Caa nanites didn’t call themselves Phoenicians. Sometimes in the early periods they are call Amorites (around 2000ac). Well the Summerians invented astrology, mathematics , alchemy, the first tipe of writing (but not the a lphabet, invented by the Amorites or Phoenicians) and of cou rse ritual magic. Their writing was not easy to learn, the Cunneiform writing, so when the amorites establish their gove rnment on the Cities of Isin and Larsa, the Asirian empire was bo rn. The asirian language was written on the cuneifo rm ideograms until the adoption of the arameic on the year 752bc . The Arameic language is a semitic language mother o f the Hebrew language, it was written using the Pho enician alphabet. This is very important because the aramei c language was spoken not only on Mesopotamia but i n all the Middle East, it is the language use to write the or iginal bible with Ezra latter transliterate to Hebr ew character, it was also the language Jesus himself spoke, and it was l ike the latin language in roman time, a universal l anguage use by educated people to communicate to each other around different nations. So now, speaking about the origins of the cabalah, It should be very clear that with the invention of math and the 22 letter alphabet, the cabalah was born as a collater al philosophy of numbers and letters. If you want t o express the infinite possibilities of creation, you need a set of elements that once put together in different for ms could give and infinite output or possibilities, and this is what the alephbeth (alphabet) does, so god himself when creating the infinite universe had to use the alphabeth, the wor d, the verb, to create it since here is found a spe cific set of element that when mix togheter in different forms can creat e and infinite of possible convinations. Now, if the Caananites invented the Cabalah, who in vented the tree of life? It is my believe that the egiptian invented the sep hiroth, and the Jewish invented the path and arrang e of the tree of life. It is said that the egiptians invented the concept of zero. If this is true, then they invented the se phirot. With the invention of zero and the decimal system you can co unt and count and number any number from zero to th e infinite."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life is precisely that a decimal system so arranged with the intention to illustraste the infinite in a definite way. There is and egiptian papyrus call Nesi Amsu, in th e chapter call the Paut Neteru or Company of the Go ds with arrange the ten divinities responsible of the creat ion in a way identical to the tree of life, the God s are seen like emanations from one single source, here Ra says: “I was alone. I made a foundation for my heart ( or will), and I created multitudes of things which ev olved themselves like unto the evolutions of the god Khep era, and their offspring came into being from the e volutions of their births. I emitted from myself the gods Shu an d Tefnut, and from being One I became Three; Shu an d Tefnut brought forth Seb and Nut, and Nut brought forth Os iris, Horus-khent-an-maa, Sut, Isis, and Nephthys a t one birth.\" Paut Neteru Ra Tefnut Shu Nut Seb Osiris Neftis Horus Set Isis The Egyptians also believe that words were powerful and that some combinations of sounds could heal or course. They also believe that the gods could be summon to visible appearance and then compelled or force to d o the magicians will, wile the other nations around them were afraid of their gods and only try to please th em with the sacrifices and then hope that the gods will be nice to them. The magic circle however was introduced n ot by the egiptians but by the Babylonians. So how the Jewish ended being credited as the custo dians of the Cabalah? Well remember that the founder of the Jewish people was Abraham from Canaan, and that the Jewish peopl e were slaves on Babylon and Egypt, then Moses himself was an initiate on the Egiptian Misteries, do I have t o explain further? Finally, during the renascence after the publicatio n of the sepher yetzirah the jewish scholars start to try different possible arrangement of the tree of life sephiroth and it path or 22 leters. The two most known jewish scholars on attempting this where the Ar\"i (Rabbi Yitzchak Luri a) and the second by the Gr\"a (Rabbi Ha'Gaon Eliyah u of Vilna). But the Tree of Life as we know it today is not at all a Jewish invention but a Christian one! that wa s introduced by, the Jesuit, Kircher. He used his tree to reconcile Catholic Theology with Jewish thinking. On 1856 The French Occultist Eliphas Levi will add the Hebrew letters to the tarot cards and will vinculate the tarot wit h the cabala and the Tree. To conclude, lets imagine what the Cabalah was in t he times of Canaan and Babylon, Well the ten sephir oth tree of life didn’t exist yet, but the cananites knew at le ast seven sefiroth and 22 path, the seven sefiroth are the forces of the seven planets, over the seven planets, the Great Ab ism, the home of Tiamat, The Serpent of Old, the Ou ter Space. The Seven Pointed Star is the symbol of Astarte, Go dess of the Caananites and of Magic. If cristianity find its origins 2,000 years ago, Occultism has it origins 6 ,000 years ago with the Summerian, Babilonians, Can aanites, Assyrians etc. Does, summerians realy invented Caba lah or is the Cabalah, the astrology, math etc the legacy of Atlantys?
