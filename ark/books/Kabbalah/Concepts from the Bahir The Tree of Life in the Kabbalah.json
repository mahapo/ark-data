[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Concepts from the Bahir: The Tree of Life in the Kabbalah Back to Mormon Mysticism The Secret at the Heart of Alchemy Excerpt from A Monument to the End of Time: Alchemy , Fulcanelli, & the Great Cross by Jay Weidner & Vincent Bridges Unlike Christianity, which denounced its mystical o rigins as heresy, Judaism retained a powerful connection with those s ame mystical roots. Our earliest alchemical text, \"Isis the Prophetess to her son Horus,\" points to an Egypto-Hebraic source for its transfor mational philosophy. Interestingly enough, a Hebrew contemporary of the author of \"Isis the Prophetess\" story, Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana, revea led to his students the magical technology behind these transformationa l processes. In the latter centuries of the Dispersion, his teachings w ould form the basis of the traditional Kabbalah. The oldest and most influential of all Kabbalistic texts, The Bahir, or The Illumination (from Job 37:21 \"And now they do n ot see light, it is illumination (bahir) in the skies.\") was also calle d the \"Midrash of Rabbi Nehuniah,\" to emphasize his authorship. Altho ugh the Bahir is the primary text of the Kabbalah, it does not use that term. Kabbalah, from the Hebrew root QBL meaning received or given, came into fashion much later when the teachings of the first century mystics were indeed just \"received traditions.\" The sages of the Bahir preferred the more ancient term Maaseh Merkabah, literally \"Worki ngs of the Chariot.\" The name possesses connotations of an active mystic al experience as opposed to a received tradition. The Bahir combines the ideas of the work of creation, animating matter, with the radica l concept of a celestial projection as a way to return to the divi ne source. By juxtaposing these ideas, The Bahir reveals the secr et at the heart of alchemy. The key concept is the Tree of Life, Etz Chaim, as described in the work of creation texts such as the Sepher Yetsirah. The Tree of Life is a diagram that pictures reality as the intersection o f four great realms, or levels of abstraction. A geometric pattern cryst allizes within the intersection planes like a moir√© pattern in a holog raphic projection. Ten localities, spheres or sephiroth, are connected by twenty-two paths, processes or states of becoming. The entire diagram was thought to describe the nature of creation. God's artistic tec hnique if you will. But it's true importance to the sages was its appli cation to the human condition. As God is supposed to have made man in his image an d likeness, then man was thought to contain, in microcosm, the entire Tr ee of Life. To the western esotericists, the Tree of Life functioned m uch like the Kundalini diagrams of the Hindu mystics. By mapping the internal power centers, and then projecting outward and aligning t hem with the forces of nature, the magician sought to re-enact the proc ess of creation. And so become, like God, a co-creator of the universe. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The sephiroth and the paths are arranged in a few b asic patterns. The top three localities, Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, ( Crown, Wisdom and Understanding) create a triangular motif that is th en inverted and projected downward through the pattern. The first i nverted triangle, Chesed, Geburah, Tipharesth, (Mercy, Strength and B eauty) is repeated by the third and last triangle, Netzach, Hod and Yesod (Victory, Splendor and Foundation.) The whole pattern is then resolved by, and enfolded into, the last sephiroth, Malkuth (Kingdom.) Each of these triangular patterns represent one of the realms or levels of abstraction. The repetition of the pattern also creates three columns or pillars on the Tree. Facing the Tree, the three columns are Mercy, Transformation (note this column connects Malkuth w ith Kether, Heaven to Earth), and Severity. These repetitions of three ca n also be seen as the three persons of the trinity, the law of threes, or thesis, antithesis and synthesis to the modern philosopher. The first three verses of the sixth chapter of Rabb i Akiva's Sepher Yetsirah supplies the key to astronomical alchemy, although in a truly oblique fashion. The first verse informs us that as proof of the existence of the Tree of Life, the twelve, the seve n, and the three, \"He set them in the Teli, the cycle and the Heart.\" The secret lies in the mysterious word Teli. It occ urs in neither the Torah nor the Talmud, although it is used in the Ba hir. There is considerable dispute among scholars as to its preci se meaning. The only similar word in the Bible is a single reference to some kind of weapon in Genesis. Apparently, from the root of the word, talah or to hang, it must have been some kind of bolo, or a weight, susp ended on a rope for throwing. This suggests that the Bahir is talking about the c elestial axis around which the heavens rotate. This means that the celes tial axis is a kind of imaginary string from which the celestial globe hangs. But what is the string connected to? An ancient Midrash, \"The P rayers of Rabbi \"In The Beginning,\" tells us that it \"hangs (by a threa d) from the fin of the Leviathan.\" This ancient serpent can be nothing other than the constellation of Draco, the Pole Serpent mentioned in Job 26:13 \"By His Spirit the heavens were calmed, His hand pierced th e Pole Serpent.\" And in 2nd Isaiah 27:1 \"On that day (the day of judgmen t) with His great sharp sword, God will visit and overcome the Leviat han, the Pole Serpent, and the Leviathan, the Coiled Serpent, and He will kill the dragon of the sea.\" It is important to note that th ree such dragons are mentioned. To understand this, we must look up to the stars. W e can find the Pole Star, Polaris in the tail of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. This marks our north celestial pole, directly above the north pole of our planet. There is another pole in the sky however. This is the pol e of the solar ecliptic, the path of the sun through the constella tions. The earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees away from the ecliptic. This tilt causes the celestial pole above our planetary pole to describe a great circle in the sky over long periods of time. In 4500 BCE, Thu ban, a star in the tail of Draco, marked the celestial pole. This pole has, over time, shifted to Polaris. The ecliptic pole however does not change, since th e path of the sun"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"through the sky never changes. Around this point, w hich has no star visible to the naked eye to mark it, the constellat ion of Draco, the Great Dragon, spirals through all of the zodiacal s igns, the stars appear to hang, talah, from it. Draco thereby becom es the Teli, which the Sepher Yetsirah in chapter 6:3 tells us, is \"ov er the universe like a king on his throne.\" This is perhaps an echo of a n ancient form of worship, that of the God Most High identified with Baal, that predated the arrival of the Hebrews in Palestine. It is also the serpent of the garden, climbing its way up the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the brazen serpent used by Moses in the wilderness and even Hermes caduceus staff. The Gnos tic Ophites, who worshipped the serpent in the Garden of Eden for gi ving us the gift of knowledge which provided an escape from the Demiurg e, formulated the image of a snake spiraling around an egg. In simple terms, this is the serpent of Draco coiled around the ellipse made by the celestial pole. The Bahir, in verse 106, announces that the Teli is nothing but \"the likeness before the Blessed Holy One,\" or the face of God. Verse 96 of the Bahir addresses key alchemical symbols, and may in fact be our earliest mention of The Philosopher's Stone. It beg ins \"What is the earth from which the heavens were graven (created)? It is the throne of the Blessed Holy One. It is the Precious Stone and the Sea of Wisdom.\" From the Bahir, we learn that the Tree of Life is a ctually the Precious Stone whose facets are projected onto the celestial sphere and which is part of the continuous flow os the Sea of Wisdom. J ohn's Revelation is a version of this, with the Tree of Life on the banks of the flowing river, deep inside New Jerusalem's Cube of Space. W e can also see that all of this weird symbolism actually has a context and a meaning, and is grounded in firm reality. So what happened to the Tree of Knowledge? Is it ba nished from the perfected schema? The Bahir suggests, in many subtl e references, that the Tree of Knowledge forms itself round the axis o f the celestial pole, whose Teli or dragon axis would be the backward spi raling axis of the precession of the equinoxes. The north celestial pole, as it circles around the fixed point of the ecliptic pole, first leans in toward the angle of t he galactic axis, that is toward the center of the galaxy. It then mo ves away, in a large precessional cycle. The Fall occurs when the Tree i s tilted away from the galactic axis. The resurrection and redemption, the arrival of the kingdom of heaven, happens when the Tree tilts towa rd the galactic axis. The four great ages then are the tilting in towards the center of the galaxy, which translates into the Golden and Silver ages and the tilting away from the center of the galaxy, which brings on the Bronze and the current Iron age. The mystical experience of the galgal, or cycle, of the Tree of Knowledge is the whirlwind, or Sufah in our Talmudi c reference. The galgal is also spoken of in the Bahir as a womb. Th is is a cycle of time in which the future is born. All of time happens wi thin the Sphere defined by the Teli. The Bahir also tells us that t he Teli is revealed in the Heart of Heaven. This is both our own human, personal, spiritual center, the heart of man, and the heart at the cent er of our own Milky Way galaxy. Together they pulsate in harmony of the same wave."}]
