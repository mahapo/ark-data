YISHMAEL SAID: He also gave me the measure of the nose right and left, as well as that of the lips and cheeks. Also he gave me the measure of the forehead, he also set down rules for every cubit. The width of the forehead is equal to the height of the neck, and so is the shoulder. The length of the nose (is) like the length of the small finger.

His hands are as rods of gold, set with beryl. His body is as polished ivory, overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble, Set upon sockets of fine gold.

RABBI YISHMAEL TOLD THIS (THING) TO RABBI AQIBA.

I and Rabbi Aqiba vouch for this, that whoever knows this measure of our Creator, and the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, he will sure ly be a son of the world to come, provided he learns it regularly every day: His body fills the Throne of Fire of the Torah .

The Holy One, blessed be He, bestowed His splendor and His beauty on the ministering Angel Metatron, the Lord of the Presence, who has been appointed grand master over al l the Lords and ministering angels.

Only to Mosheh did He give permission to use it, as it is written ( Torah Doverim 23:20): \" Behold I send an angel before you ,\" and the Holy One, blessed be He, warned Mosheh to beware of Him, as it says ( Torah Shmoth 23:21): \" Beware of Him, and obey His voice, disobey Him not, for He will not pardon your transgressions because My Name is in Him .\" And Mosheh said to the Holy One, blessed be He ( Torah Shmoth 33:15): \" If Your NOT (Lo)-Presence go with me; carry us (into the) NOT (Lo), up from here .\" The angels that are with him (Metatron) come and surround the Throne of Glory, the y on one side, Chayot on the other, and the Shekhinah upon the Shekhinah of Glory is in the middle.
