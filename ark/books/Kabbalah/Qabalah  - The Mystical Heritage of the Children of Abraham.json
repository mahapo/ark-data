My brother and I attended Hebrew school from a young age, and we regularly attended services and holiday celebrations at our local synagogue. I treasure the memories of receiving my father’s blessing before the Ark of the To r a h on the occasion of my bar mitzvah , 1 and observing my mother lighting candles on the Sabbath. But, as my heart opened a nd mind developed, I could not shake a feeling from deep within myself that Rabbinical Judaism had somehow become disconnected from its spiritual taproot. Something essential was missing. It appeared to me that a rigid fence had been built around the letter of the To r a h , but that the living spirit of the To r a h was no longer there. I knew that other religions had distinct and beautiful mystical traditions, but where was ours? The rabbis never me ntioned it, never taught us anything about it. Moreover, what was the original Hebrew religion like long before there were rabbis and temples, and we lived as nomadic tribes as the children of Abraham? Like many young Jews in the late 1960’s, I began to voraciously read everything I could find on mystical and occult subjects. I went to see any teac her from any mystical tradition who “brought their show to town”—and in the late 1960’s and the ‘70’s there were a lot of shows! I learned and experimented with a wide spectrum of meditation practices, and was blessed with some breakthrough experiences that further fueled my spiritual thirst. At that ripe moment, I found an English translation of the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ) published by the Work of the Chariot Trust. The WCT edition contained the entire text in the so-called Ezra Hebrew alphabet, as well as, in a more ancient Hebrew alphabet—the Sinatic or Gezer Hebrew. As soon as I saw the letters of the older alphabet, something resounded very deeply within me. I immediately became obsessed with learning more about the Sefer Yetzirah and the old alphabet."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\u0015\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% I wrote to an address in the book and soon received a reply inviting me to join a group that met informally on Thursday nights. I went to the meeting site with great excitement and anticipation. The unique, brilliant, and delightfully eccentric man who led the group was completely different than what I had imagined. I soon came to apprec iate that he was an advanced mystic of exceptional vision. His teaching displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of all mys tical traditions, anchored in and corroborated by his own extensive direct experience. As an accomplished physicist, he exhorted us to be mystical scientists: to test the hypotheses of the mystical worldviews, to engage in the meditation practices as if they were experiments, and to “collect data” on all that we expe rienced. He told us to regard our lives as our own mystical laboratories. I will refer to this gentleman, who is now retired from teaching, as our mentor. He ne ver put his name on any of the translations he published, nor took credit for his work. While he wholeheartedly shared his extensive knowledge and insights with thousands of people over a pe riod of two decades, he never referred to himself as a teacher. In fact, he repeatedly said that “The Lord is the only teacher; the Lord is the only rabbi; the Lord is the only guru.” After he was recruited by an ancient order of Mystical Qabalists, called “ Ma’aseh Merkabah ” (Work of the Chariot), to engage in work specifically intended to “water the mystical roots of the children of Abraham,” he formed a religious trust through which to publish his translations of primary qabalistic texts. He never asked for any money, and gave away thousands of copies of the books he produced at his own expense. He told us that true religion—the universal teaching of “rebinding” with our divine nature—was the birthright of all humans and the purpose of all li fe. I continued to attend the weekly meetings for many y ears, and have subsequently substantiated much of what he taught us through my own direct experiences. I have maintained a relationship with this enigmatic gentleman for over three decades. During the first year of attending the work group, I exhaustively searched many bookstores that specialized in mystical and occult material, as well as, Judaica and Orientalia. I also plowed through the extensive collections at the research"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\u0003 F\u0005\u0002\u0011\u0007 ? \" \u0010\" \u0005\u0003\u0005\u0006%\u0006\u0012\u0005 \u0015\u0018 libraries of the University of California at Los Angeles and Hebrew University in Tel Aviv. These efforts convinced me that what our mentor was teaching us was exceptional for its quality, unprecedented in its clarity and breadth, and largely proprietary. Dozens of the diagrams in the Work of the Chariot editions could not be found in any other books on the subject. While many books I reviewed claimed to be presenting the ideas and practices of the Mystical Qabalah, I found th at most of them were eclectic admixtures of occult informati on and practices drawn largely from the Hermetic Qabalah. With all due respect, I found much of the material in the rabbinical writings to be obscure, convoluted, and quasi-philosophi cal. Few of the rabbinical sources described actual mystical practices. Those that did were often hard to follow, and provi ded little explanation about what happens when you ascend the Tree. As I searched through miles of print on Jewish mysticism, and digested what I was learning from my mentor and experiencing in my practices, many fundamental questions arose in my mind. Master Abraham did not come out of a spiritual vacuum, nor was his dispensation of a monotheistic worldview the first among ancient cultures. In what ways did the cosmologies of the various ancient Near Eastern civilizations influence the shaping of the monot heistic worldview of the tribal Hebrews? Did Abraham’s children via his concubines simply go to Jordan when he divided his family and sent them “east to the east country?” Or, is it possible that they went much further east across long traveled sea or land trades routes from the Sinai Peninsula to the Indus Valley? What was the original religion of the desert Hebrews like in practice? How did their religious practices change during centuries of Egyptian enslavement? What was the ultimate impact of the construction of a centralized Temple to house the Ark of the C ovenant, with its attendant class of hereditary priests bound to a st rict code of levitical purity? Furthermore, the word ‘rabbi’ does not appear anywhere in the To r a h , and was not an official title or position until after rabbinical academies were established in the fifth century BCE. How did the Pharisaic rabbinical sect secure its position of dominance and orthodox authority over Judaism by the time of the late Hasmonean Period?

Was Master Mohammed really the last in th e line of the Shemite prophets, and the Qur’an its final revelation? When regarded outside the context of the dogmas that developed to support the orthodox authority of their respective conventional religions, do the Mystical Qabalah, Mystical Christianity, and Sufism present successive fresh versions of the same underlying tradition? Who were the Karaites and why did they maintain a strong voice in the Jewish community for almost se ven centuries? What mystical doctrines and meditation practices were prevalent among Qabalists in medieval and Rena issance times? Why was Sabbatai Zevi regarded as such a threat by the orthodox establishment? How did the modern sect of Chasidism arise? What are its core ideas and practices? These and many other questions bubbled up in my mind, and searching for definitive answers has continued to this day. It should be clearly understood that the teachings presented in this book are not centered in the Rabbinical Jewish Kabbalah, nor exclusively intended for thos e born of Jewish parents. Our mentor explicated the full range of ideas and practices of the Mystical Qabalah within a uni versalistic context. He also presented those of every othe r mystical tradition by way of comparison and confirmation. By the Mystical Qabalah, we are referring to an ancient mystical transmission that preceded and supersedes any of the religious vessels through which it has been subsequently filtered and adapted. These vessels include the Israelite Hebrew, Rabbinical Judaic, Mystical Christian, Sufi Islamic, and possibly even, the North Indian Tantric. Each of these vessels has framed the unive rsal teachings of the Mystical Qabalah within the context, langua ge, and cultural milieu of their respective dispensations. Each version is unique and beautiful, to be respected and celebrated. But no single one of these vessels can legitimately claim to be the orthodox authority for these teachings. The Mystical Qabalah is a living tradition, dependent upon “Trees of Perfection” to retransmit its essence and water its roots.

Many people these days read about the Qabalah, and many recent authors purport to reveal its “true and hidden secrets” in their books. But, in reality, there are precious few genuine Trees of Perfection in any of the lineages mentioned above. The Qabalah is something that is practiced and experienced. Yet, most of the people who study the Qabalah do not engage in its practices, and most of the authors who write on the subject have little, if any, direct experience of that which they expound upon with such seeming authority. I have been given the humbling task of recording and representing, as accurately as possible, what our dear mentor transmitted to us in private meetings during the course of those many years. I have assiduously striven to maintain the voice and stylistic idiosyncrasies of our mentor whenever possible. In my role as recorder, I make no pretense to speak with divine authority or from a position of mastery.

Until that time, most books in English on the Qabalah were written either by scholars, who approached it from a pedagogical or historical angle, or by Hermetic/Practical Qabalists who framed it within an occult perspective. The Work of the Chariot was rooted in the oral teachings of an accomplished my stic who was a genuine master of the Tree of Life, a real “Man of the Ayn .” The emphasis of his teaching was to engage in pr actices that would lead each individual to their own experiential understanding, their own ascent of the Tree. This book is the first time that a senior member of this group has recorded these teachings in detail. If you are new to the subject of the Mystical Qabalah, you will find a wealth of clear, albeit compact, information. It will both familiarize you with the arcane ideas and obscure terminology of the qabalistic worldview, as well as, give you detailed instructions on qabalistic meditation and ancillary practices that you can immediately start to use. If you already have some familiarity with the subject, or come from an occult, Thele mic, or Pagan background, you will likely discover information and diagrams in this book that you have never seen.

The ensuing discussion addresses a number of basic questions: • What is the universal Mystical Qabalah of the children of Abraham? • In what ways is the Mystical Qabalah distinct from the Practical or Hermetic Kabbalah? • In what ways is the Mystical Qabalah distinct from the Rabbinical Jewish Kabbalah? • What is the relationship between the Mystical Qabalah and Mystical Christianity? • What is the relationship between the Mystical Qabalah and Sufism? • What are the similarities between the Mystical Qabalah and North Indian Tantra? Chapter One concludes with a comparison between the qabalistic teachings regarding the Work of Creation ( ma’aseh b’reshith) and the Work of the Chariot ( ma’aseh merkabah ), and contemporary ideas in modern scientific cosmology. Chapter Two introduces and de scribes the primary textual sources of the Mystical Qabalah of the children of Abraham. These sources include the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ); the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ); the Seferim HaTorah ( Books of the Law ); the Sefer HaZohar ( Book of Splendor ), and particularly its three core texts—the Sifra Detzniyutha ( Book of THAT Which is Concealed ), the Idra Rabba Qadusha ( Greater Holy Assembly ), and the Idra Zuta Qadusha ( Lesser Holy Assembly ); Merkabah (lit. Throne) literature, including the Seferim HaChanokh ( Books of Enoch son of Yared ), the verses from the Books of Isaiah and Ezekiel , and the Sh’ir Qoma (Measure of the Divine Body from the Sefer Raziel HaGadol ); the Peshitta (Gospels ) and the Revelation of John ; the Qur’an ; and the Etz HaChayyim ( Tree of Life ).

In this chapter, the reader will learn about the Ayn , the negatively existent Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of All Things and Its two Faces: Vast Face and Small Face. This is followed by an explication of the nature and composition of the qabalistic Tree of Life, including its roots, columns, Inner Court, Directional Sefiroth, and letter-gates. The Tree of Life is a central feature of the mystical tradition that lies at the heart of the ancient Hebrews. Among students of Qabalah, there is considerable confusion about the Tree. This is due in no small measure to the many books on the subject that present various hybrid versions of the Tree, and attribute to the Tree a wide range of occult and mythological information not based in the qabalistic tradition. Hermetic Qabalists will find notable differences between the way the Mystical Qabalah correla tes the Hebrew letters with the Gates on the Tree and those commonly seen in occult books on the subject. The Tree provides a map through the four qabalistic worlds and the shells of embodied existence ( qlifoth ), which are addressed in successive sections in this chapter. The Tree also portrays what the first book of the To r a h describes as the “Fall of Adam,” which is then discussed in detail within the context of qabalistic teachings. The information that is provided up to this point in the chapter serves as a suitable backdrop to introduce the Divine Name hvhy , which is of singular importance in qabalistic practices, and to discuss the nature of messianic appearance within the context of the qabalistic teachings. Chapters Four and Five contai n extensive information and a singularly comprehensive collection of Tree of Life diagrams culled from all of the primary texts. As a useful comparison, Chapter Five examines some Trees of Life from other mystical traditions, including the Chakras of the Tantric tradition, and the “Before-the-World Sequence” of Trigrams from the Shuo Qua , the eighth and oldest wing of the Chinese I Ching ( Book of Changes ). With a solid foundation of core ideas regarding the qabalistic worldview and a thorough orientation to the nature of qabalistic practices under the reader’s belt, Chapter Six presents a wealth of information in preparation for engaging in the meditation practices of the Mystical Qabalah.

The main body of the text clos es with an epilogue containing some final observations on the study and practices of the Mystical Qabalah, and a brief discussion of the idea of “Hebrew Renewal” i.e. a return to the religion of Abraham.

Each mystical tradition has its ow n unique array of technical terminology. In writing a book that considers comparative features of several mystical traditions, th e challenge is further compounded to transliterate the considerable diversity of such terminology in a manner that is consistent, accurate, and helpful to readers who might be unfamiliar with the source languages. A review of several hundred books on the subject of the Qabalah/Kabbalah/Cabala reveals that there is wide variation in how Hebrew and Aramaic words are transliterated. This has generated some confusion regarding the proper pronunciation of the qabalistic terminology. There are generally two different approaches that can be taken to transliteration. One approach emphasizes the most accurate representation of the letter sequence from the source language. In this option, the transliteration may not always clearly portray the actual pronunciation of a word. The second approach emphasizes the most accurate pronunciation of the word, whereby the transliteration may vary from the precise lettering of the source language. In this book, accurate representation of the source letter sequence is followed whenever possible. However, when a choice must be made between the two options, accurate pronunciation is favored to ensure that the reader learns how to properly pronounce the many obscure terms found in the literature and teac hings of the Mystical Qabalah, Sufism, and the Tantras. Even then, transliterating the Hebrew requires further decisions. There are some distinct differences between the Sefardic and Ashkenazi pronuncia tion of the same words, and the pronunciation of some letters may have been lost over time. Clearly distinguishing between the two different aspects of each of the seven Double letters also presents some problems. Since the Ashkenazi Hebrew is a more recent dialect that generally developed and evolved outside of Palestine, and was substantially influenced by European languages, the Sefardic pronunciations have been selected as more faithful to the original Hebrew and Aramaic dialects of the Middle Eastern Semitic cultures. Throughout the text, an effort has been made to juxtapose transliterated words with their spelling in Hebrew letters.

In this book, that heritage is called the Mystical Qabalah. 1 Within the context of Rabbinical Judaism, this mystical tradition has come to be known as the Jewish K abbalah, and in Islam, as Sufism ( Arabic tasawwuf ). The Christian C abala emerged from the mystical side of Christianity, which developed as a parallel tradition to Pauline dogma as it diverged and became es tranged from its Judaic roots. The Christian Cabala evolved as a way to harmonize Jewish kabbalistic doctrines with Christian theology. The precise usage of the word Qabalah to denote the ideas and practices of the esoteric teachings and the secrets of the To r a h emerged from the circle of Yitza’aq the Blind (1200CE), and was used in the same context by Eleazar of Worms (beginning of the thirteenth century). 2 The word Qabalah ( hlbq lit. receiving, also “welcoming of God”) alludes to a dynamic state of direct communication and mystical union of the individual soul with the Divine. In that sense, it is synonymous with the Sanskrit word Yoga (lit. union with or absorption in the Divine). The rich spiritual potential of the Mystical Qabalah has long been obscurated and overshadowed by the preponderant visibility of the Magical or Practical Qabalah, whose disciples pursue power as a tool of their own will. The wonderful possibilities for deep spiritual awakening, intensified devotion, and selfless service to the Divine Will offered by the Mystical Qabalah have also been made difficult to access by the strict halachic barriers and obfuscating intellectual hurdles erected by Rabbinical Jewish Kabbalists."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\u00173 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% The formal prohibition against the study and practice of the Qabalah was lifted in 1540 CE through the efforts of the medieval Jewish Kabbalist Abraham Azulai. The prohibition had been instituted largely in reaction to the disastrous consequences of the false Messiah Shimeon Bar Kochba, who led a revolt in 135 CE that resulted in a short- lived independent Jewish state. 3 Over a century after Azulai, a sense of fear and taboo regarding the Qabalah arose strongly once again among the rabbinate in reaction to the troubling popularity of the apostate Sabbatai Zevi. Zevi was ascribed messianic stature by his “prophet” Nathan of Gaza, and embraced as such by several million followers spread across the Middle East. The phenomenon of Zevi was further compounded by the widespread herm etic adultera tion of Jewish qabalistic teachings by European occultists, and a growing tendency among Christian Cabalists to attempt to establish that the true hidden meaning of the Qabalah supports the efficacy of Christian dogma. The widespread anti-qabalisti c sentiment promulgated by both the rabbinical and Pauline orthodox authority has been accompanied by a considerable amount of misinformation and fear mongering. Even those rabbis and Talmudic scholars who do not regard the Mystical Qabala h as evil and malicious echo the injunctions that it should only be studied by married Jewish men over the age of forty who have studied the To r a h and Ta l m u d for many years. In all fairness, it should be noted that there are a substantial number of Chasidim and other religious Jews who embrace and encourage the study and practice of the Jewish Kabbalah without distinction of age or gender. However, they represent a very small minority, and firmly regard the Qabalah as the exclusive property of Ort hodox Judaism. The overall result is that the vast majority of cont emporary Jews, most of whom are not orthodox, have little knowledge of their own immensely rich mystical tradition. The lingering barriers and attitudes of exclusivity regarding the study of the Jewish Kabbalah serve to perpetuate a long standing sexist and elitist minds et that discourages individuals from pursuing direct mystical e xperience outside the context of orthodox religious observance as established by the Pharisees subsequent to the Diaspora. 4 These attitudes also serve to"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E \u00170 solidify the position of orthodox rabbis as intermediaries and authorities in the dispensation of the Jewish religion. The authority of the Pharisees evol ved from the growing prominence of the academies of Jewish learni ng that started to appear in the late fifth century BCE under the to lerant regime of the Persians, after hundreds of years of Assyrian and Babylonian repression. The word Pharisee comes from the word parush , meaning ‘one separated’ i.e. one who withdraws himself out of motives for piety. Among the Jews thus separated, there arose not only differences in social customs, but also in doctrinal views—and specifically, an oral tradition. This oral tradition not only outlined a rigorous routine of lifestyle and conduct, but also created special learning and knowledge that was the exclusive domain of the members of the sect. In this way, a community of such learned men developed. Th eir special knowledge drew an excess of reverential regard fro m the masses of people who were not privy to it, for which Master Yeshuvah (Jesus) and later Master Muhammad chastised th em. The masses hence became the laity outside of this elite community of Pharisees. The intense and complicated levitical focus of the rabbinical sect developed from the codes of behavior and traditions institutionalized by the priesthood ( kohanim ) of the centralized Temples in Jerusalem. The strict codes reflected the extraordinary level of levitical purity that had to be maintained to enact the high level rituals performed in the First Temple, which housed the Ark of the Covenant. Within that context, the priests needed to be like angels who attend the Throne of the Lord hvhy . The kohanic codes had a significant impact on the development of the Pharisaic rabbinate centuries later. They were redacted much later in the Talmud Yerushalmi and Talmud Babli, which contain voluminous commentary garnered from over four centuries of rabbinical dialectic. The Talmud is composed of the Mishnah and the Gemara . The Mishnah is a collection of scriptural exegesis attributed to various heralded Palestinia n rabbis, many of whom were associated with rabbinical academies from the fifth through second centuries BCE. The tractates of the Mishnah were edited and codified circa 220 CE, and form the core of the Talmud .

The Gemara of Jerusalem was formally compiled circa 430 CE, and the Gemara of Babylon circa 530 CE. The Talmud Yerushalmi is composed of three volumes and the Ta l m u d Babli has sixty- four volumes, reflecting the relative complexity of the environments and cultural milieus in which they developed. The Pharisaic rabbinate emerged as the dominant sect in Judaism, occupying the seat of its orthodox authority. It peaked with the virtual political and economic control of the Temple of Jerusalem by the Sadducees and Pharisees in the Hasmonean period, after the liberation of Jerusalem by the Maccabees. The many warnings and stern admonitions pronounced by a succession of Hebrew prophets went unheeded. When Master Yeshuvah came, he berated the widespread corruption and abuse of power among the Sadducees and Pharisees, and struck out against the moneychangers within the Temple (which had become the biggest bank in the Middle East). The dominance of the Pharisaic rabbinical sect solidified even further in the Diaspora after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. Except for the Karaite and Sabbataian movements, this dominance has remained largely unchallenged to this day, though cracks in the wall are starting to appear. Few Jews give much thought to the idea that the religion of their desert Hebrew forebears might have been radically different in practice than Rabbinical Judaism. The word “rabbi” is not to be found in the Hebrew To r a h and only finds limited usage in the entire Tanakh ( To r a h , Prophets, and Writings ), where it is used to denote tribal leaders and other authorities. 5 Master Yeshuvah told his disciples not to take the title “rabbi,” and taught that the Lord hvhy is the only true Rabbi. 6 The anthropological and linguistic elements that shaped the nomadic Israelite tribes are topics of much conjecture and dialogue among Ancient Near Eastern scholars from a variety of disciplines. The first book of the To r a h (called Torah B’reshith ) says that Abraham came from “Ur of the Chaldees.” What were the history, ethnic composition, and cultural and religious milieus from which Abraham came? How was his faith influenced by the cosmologies of the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Canaanites? Was"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E \u0017\u0016 the original Hebrew alphabet developed before Abraham’s time as a way to alphabetically represent Sumerian cuneiform glyphs? Or, did it originate in the mystical manual on the Hebrew letters ascribed to him, called the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation )? As the vehicle for a fresh expr ession of the universal mystical spirituality promoted directly in the face of widespread idol worship, how did Abraham and the Israelite tribes practice their religion? The life of the early Israelites would have had much in common with all nomadic tribes who dwelled in tents under the starry skies of the desert sa vannas of Canaan and the Sinai Peninsula. Such tribes were largely extended families who tended their flocks and engaged in the labors necessary to feed and clothe themselves. It is lik ely that the religious observances of the Hebrews would have i nvolved quintessential spiritual practices dating from antiquity and found in all monotheistic religions. These practices include: ablution, prostration, invocation of Divine Names, devotional singing, prayer offerings, ritual use of sacraments and sacred regard for the elements, community-building rituals based on the mystical significance of rites of passage and seasons of nature, and the special treatment of guests. In the To r a h , there are numerous accounts of holy figures ascending to and worshipping at power spots on special mountains. There are also several accounts of the ritual use of a stone lingam , over which was poured a libation of oil or perhaps milk. Nu merous passages in the To r a h also poignantly allude to the experien tial transformati on of individual consciousness in Divine Union, and the presence and importance of mystics and awakened souls throughout the history of the Hebrews and Jews. The monotheism of Master Abraham did not simply mean that there was only one God, but rather that the Divine Source alone exists . Hence, the mystical focus of the early Hebrews would have centered upon the universality and pervasiveness of the Divine Source within all beings on all planes of existence. Group ritual would have unders cored and celebrated this relationship. There were no synagogues and no rabbis: there were tents and there were revered elders.

Outside the rigid myopia of compartmentalized religious dogma, the Hebrew, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and perhaps even the Tantric traditions, can be seen as branches of a single tree. These branches all share a common trunk and roots: the universal mystical spirituality of the absolute unity of the Divine, and the primacy of love, surrender, and discrimination as the means for spiritual awakening from dualistic sleep. Each of the branches is built around variations of the same totality archetype anchored in the same negatively existent substratum. Yet, the religious teachings of the different branches have somehow evolved so that the variations have become mutually exclusive.

Vedantic philosophy calls these three levels of awareness dualistic ( dvaita ), qualified non-dualistic ( vasishtadvaita ), and unqualified non-dualistic ( advaita ). 8 Within the context of the Mystical Qabalah, the dualistic level of awareness sees the Lord hvhy and His/Her Creation (i.e. matter and spirit) as separate. It is also called the “Fall of Adam.” This is the vantage of the normal waking state of most humans. An aspirant with this perspective would generally have a predominant mood toward their Chosen Ideal, regarding themselves as a servant to their Divine Master, or as a child to their Divine Father or Mother , etc. The qualified non-dual level in the Qabalah regards the Creation as a Great Unity in the Name hvhy rooted in the negatively existent substratum. From this perspective, the Mysterious Unknown (called Ayn lit. “Nothing” in the Qabalah), which is Itself eternally devoid of attributes, exists in divine sport as always possessed of all attributes. In this respect, Sufism distinguishes between the Divine Essence ( fana ) and the Divine Attributes ( fala ), and Mystical Christianity between the Father and the Son. In Hindu mystical scriptures, this is called Swagatabheda —literally “a difference within Itself.” This “difference” is said to spontaneously arise as a sort of whim of the Divine to know Itself. In the Mystical Qabalah, the “difference within Itself” is alluded to by a doctrine that distinguishes the Mysterious Unknown ( Ayn ) as having two aspects described as “Faces.” One is called “Vast Face,” denoting a station of infinite consciousness devoid of differentiation and manifest activity. The other is called “Small Face,” denoting a station of finite consciousness encompassing all differentiated, manifest activity. Small Face is also the immense I-ness of the Divine Personality endowed with all possible attributes. When this I-ness is turned outward to the Creation in the Lower Worlds, it is stationed in the consciousness that “I am All.” When this I-ness is turned inward and centered in the Upper Worlds, it has the exclusive awareness that “I am Nothing ( Ayn ).” In this sense, Vast Face can be thought of as a Cosmic Mind in which an infinite number of Small Face waves"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E \u0018\u0015 of ideas can arise from and return to Nowhere like a dream, and in which all Name and Form emanate, manifest, and dissolve. In the Qabalah, the Lord hvhy is the immense I-ness that knows Itself as Pure Being in the unmanifest supernal realm, and pervades everything from Elohim down to the lowest creature in the lower worlds of manifestation. This supreme, unifying I-ness is worshipped in Christianity as Christos , in Islam as Allah , and in the Tantras as the Divine Mother Kali . It is worshipped in Hinduism as Ishvara , in Tibetan Buddhism as Vajradhara or Avalokiteshvara , in Taoism as the Divine Mother Kwan Yin , and in the Polynesian Kahuna tradition as the Goddess Pele. 9 An individual with this level of aw areness directly perceives the innate identity of themselves and all beings with that One Indwelling Spirit. The perspe ctive of unqualified non-dualism in the Qabalah is that the Ayn alone exists and all separate existence is illusory, that a manifest Creation on all its levels has no basis in Reality, and that all the shells of embodied existence are empty. 10 It cannot be underscored strongly enough that these three distinctions exist only within the finite human intellect. They are not mutually exclusive doctrines, but represent a gradation in consciousness. All aspirants will be attracted to one of these perspectives according to their natural spiritual constitution and stage of development. One who embraces the awareness of a simple devotee i.e. who worships the Name and Form of his/her Chosen Ideal as separate from themselves, would not be attracted to and may even strongly reje ct a non-dual perspective that denies such separation or any real existence to Name and Form. Conversely, one who has the innate sense that the Root Reality has two aspects, one without attributes and the other an intelligent, unified source of all attributes, would not find any sensibility in either a purely dualistic or a purely non-dual perspective. In practice, we find that the vast majority of aspirants in these latter days resonate with the first two categories. Few souls have th e concentration, discrimination, discipline, and force of will to pursue a purely non-dual path."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\u0018\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Among Qabalists, as with aspirants in all other mystical traditions, we find that the apparently disparate distinctions described above give rise to philosophical arguments and irresolvable debates. All of these viewpoints are valid within the context of their own yogic practices, and we should not judge or condemn anyone for adhering to any one of them over the others. Any one of these perspectives taken to their ultimate end will arrive at the same experience of Pure Being that transcends all such distinctions. The Mystical Qabalah summarily involves the ascension of the Central Column of the Tree of Life to progressively unite with the consciousness of Small and Vast Face, and to pierce the profound spiritual mysteries alluded to in the To r a h and other primary sources. Many religious students of the Qabalah confuse the intentions of the Mystical Qabalah with the necessity to cultivate a high degree of levitical purity and righteousness required to ascend the Column of the Right on the Tree of Life, which is called the “Way of the Angels of Elohim .” Such levitical purity is not required to the ascend of the Central Column of the Tree, and the rigid rabbinical restrictions regarding the study of the Qabalah only within the context of orthodox halachic observance are not necessarily relevant to the purely yogic intentions of the Mystical Qabalah. The distinctions and terms regarding the different paths up the Tree will be explained in more detail in subsequent chapters. Among the primary written works of the Mystical Qabalah of the children of Abraham, few remain that are entirely faithful to their original versions. Many of them are replete with corruptions, and have taken on additions and commentary often undifferentiated from the original texts. Despite extensive evidence brought forth by linguistic experts to the contrary, most orthodox and fundamentalis t adherents in each of the respective branches of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regard their respective scriptures as completely intact and unviolated reproductions of the originals. Many English translations of the scriptures are flawed by dogmatic distinctions and/or a low level of understanding.

In rejecting the orthodox prohibitions regarding the study and practice of the Mystical Qabalah, it would be reasonable and balanced to point out that there is some inherent danger in the overzealous pursuit of qabalistic di sciplines. Many of the problems arise when aspirants are misled by unqualified teachers, have pre-existing mental imbalances, or when aspirants engage in activities related to the side columns of the Tree of Life. Problems can also manifest when individuals underestimate the power of the root mantra and do too much too soon.

The former Enoch was the grandson of Adam and the son after whom Qain was said to name a city. 11 Enoch son of Yared was the great, great, great, great grandson of Adam, and the one who “walked with Elohim ” and was transformed into Metatron ( ]vruum ). 12 The “Thirteen Enochian Keys” of Enoch son of Qain are reflected in such works as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage , the Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon , and medieval grimoires such as the Armadel , Goetia/Lemegeton, etc. 13 The primary text of the Mystical Qabalah that appears to occupy a central place of importance in the Hermetic Qabalah is the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ). However, from what is written in many of the books of Hermetic Qabalah, it is appa rent that the structure of the Tree of Life, nature of the Inner Court, and functio n of the letter- gates as explicated by the Sefer Yetzirah are widely misunderstood. The two most prominent contemporary schools of Practical or Hermetic Qabalah are the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), which still exist and continue to attract followers today. The Golden Dawn was founded in the late nineteenth century in the heyday of the Victorian Period. The document reputed to be at the foundation of the Golden Dawn system was the Cypher Manuscript attributed to Fraulein Sprengel. The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage was also an important document for the Golden Dawn and a significant influence on the controversial Al eister Crowley, who broke with the Golden Dawn and formed the Order Templis Orientis. The O . T.O was founded primarily upon works of sexual mysteries and Masonic Charters, and incor porated the Abramelin material at a later date. Until very recen tly, almost all books in English on the subject of the Qabalah, regardless of their title or professed subject, could be traced to members of these orders or to orders that evolved from them.

The vast majority of people who do study the Jewish Kabbalah are mainstream orthodox and Chasidic Jews of European descent. It is but a footnote for most conservative and reform Jews, though there is a resu rgence of interest among those in the Jewish Renewal Movement. The vast majority of the written works of Jewish Kabbalah originated or “reemerged” within the last 800 years. Ra bbinical Jews spend many years studying the voluminous Babylonian Ta l m u d in order to learn and carefully adhere to the detailed halachic interpretations of how to fulfill the 613 “ mitzvoth ,” or righteous deeds, prescribed in the extant version of the Ezra To r a h . They generally regard the current version of the To r a h to be the exact original, faithful in every detail to the one penned by Master Mosheh. Hence, they consider every word and every line to be irrefutably “delivered by the hand of God.” Like all traditional religions that center primarily upon a conventional, dualistic understanding of scriptures, the principal intention of the majority of religious Jews is to cultivate purity and righteousness for the redemption of their souls and to “secure a place in heaven in the company of the righteous.” From a qabalistic perspective, this would correspond to ascending the Tree via the Column of the Right “Way of the Angels of Elohim ”) to become like angels and gain access to the lower heavens. While many contemporar y religious students of the Jewish Kabbalah make pretense to mystical aspirations, it has become more of an intellectual exercise than the active pursuit of mystical awakening for most of them. The small minority who do aspire to mystical awakening are an eclectic group. They range from mainstream orthodox Jews to the sect of Chasidus founded by Israel ben Eliezer (1698-1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov (“Master of the Good Name”), and Nachman of Bretzlav. 14 The bulk of the mainstream orthodox Jewish Kabbalists focus primarily on the Sefer HaZohar ( Book of Splendor ) and the Etz HaChayyim ( Tre e o f Li fe ).

These practices include a variety of visualizati on techniques, breathing exercises, movements coordinated with th e permutation and combination of Hebrew letters, mantric intonation of sacred phrases, meditative prayer, and chanting devotional songs. A central contemplative practice among the Lubivitcher Chasidim who study the Jewish Kabbalah is called Hitbonenuth . Hitbonenuth is a practice involving intense directed thought within the context of proper intention ( kavanah ). The process of Hitbonenuth and how it differs from passive thought-meditation is described in detail in a Hebrew manuscript roughly 200 years old, titled Ma'amorim Ketzarim , written by the first Lubavitcher Rebbe Schneur Zalman of Liadi. 15 Hitbonenuth , as described by Rabbi Zalman, “requires intense mental exertion to increase one's awareness of the open, simple and revealed meaning of an idea, to scrutinize and elabor ate on a concept's many details, facets and ramifications, and not to allow the mind to contract and settle on one point alone.” Rabbinical Jews often feel that any qabalistic practice outside the context of religious Jewish observance is not legitimately connected with the mystical tradition of the children of Abraham. They generally regard such Qabalah as either hybrid variants adulterated by admixtures of idea s from other mystical traditions, or as the purview of occultists and the Practical Qabalah. This is not surprising. The orthodoxy in all organized religions has historically viewed the study and practice of mystical ideas as a threat to their authority. At the same time, in order to cull new members from older, often indigenous populations, they have on numerous occasions absorbed and assimilated mystical ideas and holy observances that posed no serious threat, and with which the newcomers could identify and feel comfortable. To see a clear example of this, consider how many of the so-called “pagan” traditions (ignorantly labeled as satanic witchcraft by fundamentalists) were assim ilated into orthodox Western Christianity. 16 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E \u0018\u0016 The rabbinate responded in a similar manner to diffuse the powerful influence and popularity of the Karaite movement, which originated in Persia. “The Karaites arose in reaction to and as a revolt against Rabbinical J udaism in the eighth century CE, and were not fully put down until the fifteenth century CE. From its earliest beginning, it (the Karaite revolt) spread throughout the Jewish Diaspora into every stratum of society. ‘Karaism’ derives from the Hebrew word karah (lit. to read) i.e. to read the To r a h without the intervention of rabbis. They rejected the Ta l m u d as a conspiracy of the rabbis to separate ordinary people from the simplicity of the To r a h . For them, the To r a h was the sole source of religious laws. Karaites created different oral laws to deal with modern life. Many Talmudic dietary laws were abolished and the use of tefillin (phylacteries) was abandoned. In response to the threat that the Karaites posed to their authority, the Jewish rabbis were able to prevent a final schism in Judaism by co-opting many acceptable Karaite ideas and reforming abuses. Gradually, the Karaite revolt dissipated and ceased after almost 700 years.” 17 It is also relevant to note that the Karaites attacked the provocative anth ropomorphism of the qabalistic doctrines. While few contemporary Jews know anything about the Karaites, the impetus for their revolt is similar to conditions in modern Judaism. Many Jews today feel ambivalent about and tenuously connected to Rabbi nical Judaism. Many orthodox Jews regard the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism as “heretical sects,” declaring them to be Jews only in the biological sense. In recent decades, an extraordinary number of people born and raised by Jewish parents have set out to explore the ideas and practices of other mystical traditions, as if in search of traces of their own. We hear the colloquialisms “HindJews” and “Jewdhists,” reflecting the many Jews who have passionately embraced the Hindu and Buddhist mystical traditions. Some Jews, who serious ly studied and engaged in the meditation practices of other mystical traditions, have recently come back to Judaism only to discover or see in a new light their own Mystical Qabalah.

Christianity began as a sect of Judaism that sprang from the messianic advent of Master Yeshuvah, who was born a Jew and lived in a Jewish culture. All of his apostles and early disciples were also Jews. Master Yeshuvah, as with every appearance of Messiah, brought a fresh transmission of universal mystical spirituality clothed in the context of the historical setting, cultural milieu, environm ent, language, characteristic worldview, and prevailing body of discourse among the people to whom it was being delivered. The ma instream of Jews at the time Master Yeshuvah appeared had been expecting a savior of the Jewish people who would deliver them from Roman oppression through an apocalyptic process. This contrasted with the Jewish mystical community, which had been anticipating a messianic advent with the spiritual mission of reuniting Israel with their Lord hvhy , and a returning to the true religion of the children of Abraham. Master Yeshuvah himself clearly asserted that he had not come as an innovator to replace the tradition with a new teaching, but as a reformer who had come to fulfill the To r a h and the prophets, and to renew the ancient faith that had faded into decay."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E \u00185 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law (i.e. To r a h ) or the prophets; I have not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.” 18 But what began as a small Jewish sect centered around a Jewish Messiah and understood in contemporary Jewish terms, not Greek or Roman, came to be transformed into a major religion composed almost exclusively of Gentiles. In the process of this transformation, the legacy of the Jewish heritage upon which Christianity was founde d was largely modified and assimilated into the Greek langua ge and Hellenistic worldview. As the new religion of Christianity emerged estranged from its Jewish roots, it developed in accordance with Roman political organization and social conventions. When Christians later “brought civilization” to the indigenous tribes of Western Europe, they adapted Christian theology to the languages and cultures of those tribes, and absorbed many of their conventions and observances as a means to facilitate and expedite their conversion. The resultant version of Western Christianity thereby evolved into a historical phenomenon significantly different than Near Eastern Christianity, and even farther removed from its Judaic roots. Today, a growing body of scholars is questioning many aspects of Christianity that ha ve been popularly held for a long time. A picture is emerging that shows that the history, theology, and practice of Christianity have been directly effected and shaped by dominant factions, resulting in the marginalization and suppression of the mystical element as being in opposition to accepted doctrine. As soon as Paul entered the picture, a dichotomy arose among the early Christian devotees between those coming from a traditional Jewish background and the growing group of Gentile Chris tians. In this regard, it is interesting to consider the le tter written by Master Yeshuvah’s brother James, the leader of the Jerusalem Church, as an indicator of the opposition that emerged to some of Paul’s central teachings. 19"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"3\b ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% The diversity of perspectives of the early followers of Master Yeshuvah was later replaced by the monolithic homogeneity imposed by emperors to make Christianity a uniform religion throughout their empires. As the Pauline Gentile faction grew in numbers and power, and the Cat holic Church of Rome assumed orthodox authority over Christianity, it absorbed and codified Mystical Christianity in much the same way that Rabbinical Judaism assimilated and obscura ted the Mystical Qabalah. The essential Jewishness of early Chri stianity was virtually wiped out by the massive revisionism of the Pauline Gentiles. We will have to wait for further windfall discoveries of source documents to be able to establish a clear picture of what happened during the earliest stages of Christianity after the departure of Master Yeshuvah. Like the Hebrew Qabalah, My stical Christianity has remained alive through lineages of accomplished souls who ascended its paths and passed on its teachings and practices. A new generation of Christians is seeking to revisit the mystical origins of Christianity. This interest has been fueled by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the recovery of an almost intact copy of the long-lost Gospel of Thomas at Nag Hammadi, 20 and a growing interest in the enigmatic Revelation of John spurred by the advent of a new millennium. Many Christians are also finding new meaning and inspiration in the testimonials left by Christian saints and mystics of their experiences on the Path. These documents, along with new interpretations of the teachings of Master Yeshuvah in the Peshitta , are reinforcing the understanding that the mystical element flourished in the early church, and that the entire history of Christianity is replete with mystics. Many of the ideas and practices of the Mystical Qabalah are reflected in those of Mystical Christianity. The mysteries of the Last Supper and the Crucifixion have long been compared with the mystical significance of Pesach (Passover). The sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist have their roots in the sacramental use of bread and wine that goes back to the earliest Hebrews and beyond.

A more in-depth look at the core ideas of Mystical Christianity within the context of the universal Mystical Qabalah will appear later in the book when the Peshitta and the Revelation of John are discussed in more detail. Starting in the late fifteenth century CE, a movement arose among some Jewish converts to Christianity in Spain to ascribe a distinctly Christian context to the hidden meanings of qabalistic doctrines. This movement gain ed momentum from speculation among Florentine Platonists that the Qabalah contained a lost revelation that explains the secrets of the Catholic faith. This cross-pollination led to the emergence of a distinctly Christian Cabala founded by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494). Pico’s writings, and subsequently those of John Reuchlin (1455- 1522), caused a sensation in Christian intellectual circles and ignited an interest in this previously unknown esoteric Jewish tradition that spread across Italy, Germany, and France. In the sixteenth century CE, the appearance of qabalistic texts in Latin translation enhanced attempts to draw further parallels between esoteric Jewish doctrines and Christianity. Guillaume Postel translated and published the Zohar and Sefer Yetzirah into Latin even before they were published in Hebrew. Latin texts in the seventeenth and eighteenth ce nturies were influential in standardizing “Cabala” as the spelling commonly associated with the Christian perspective to qabalistic doctrines. 21 In the seventeenth century CE, the center of Christian Cabala moved to England and Germany, where its status was boosted by the theosophical writings of Jacob Boehme and the landmark qabalistic compendium of Christian Knorr von Rosenroth. 22 Vo n Rosenroth and Athanasius Kirc hner extrapolated the qabalistic allusion of Adam Kadmon to be a reference to Jesus as the primordial man in Christian theology. In the final phase in the development of the Christian Cabala in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it became permeated with alchemical symbolism and conjoined with the emerging doctrines of theosophy. This in turn greatly influenced the development of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"3\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \t #\u001d\u0006*\u0016\u0002\u0004 \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0005 \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\t #\u001d\u0006*\u0016\u0002\u0004 \u0011 \u0006 -\u00020*\u0006*\u001e' \u0011 \u001e. \u0011* \u001d\u0004\u0002\t Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam is a primary branch stemming from the religion of the children of Abraham. Like Master Abraham, the Prophet Mohammed was faced with the task of leading his people away from the worship of idols and back to the universal mystical sp irituality of a divine singularity. If you remove the clouds of dogmatic theocracy that now often overshadow the depth and beauty of that transmission, Islam probably more closely resembles in some ways the original Hebrew religion than does Rabbinical Judaism. The mystical tradition (Ar. tasawwuf ) at the core of Islam is called Sufism by Westerners, and those who walk its path are called Sufis, dervishes, and faqirs. The appe llation “Sufi” is thought by some to have been derived from the word suf (Heb. and Ar. pure wool), reflecting the rough patchwork wool robes worn by the early Sufi ascetics to reflect the quality of spiritual poverty ( faqira ). In their literature, the Sufis have a variety of other names and eloquent titles by which they refer to themselves, such as “Possessors of the Kernel” and “Community of the Bench.” The tradition itself is also given a variety of prominent epitaphs, such as Haqiqah (“Way of Truth”), reflecting the goal of union with the singularity of the Divine Essence. As it is written: “The highest Truth is that I ALONE AM.” 23 “Everywhere you look, there is the Face of Allah .” 24 Several centuries after the birth of Islam, a number of informal private Sufi teaching circles in Iraq and Persia grew in numbers and organized into orders ( tariqa ). Soon thereafter, dozens of other orders, most of which evolved as sub-branches of the initial ones, arose throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, India, East Africa, and Spain. Sufi influence continued to expand with the spread of Islam throughout the world. The various orders trace their lineages to, and are generally named after, extraordinary Sufi masters who lived at different times and came from different locales. The Naqs hbandi take the name of their order from Khaja Bahaudin Naqs hband of Central Asia (1318- 1389), the Qadiri from Abdul Qa dir of Gilan (1077-1166), the Chishtiya from Abu Ishak Chishti of Syria, etc. 25 All genuine"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E 3\u0018 orders have a record of their chain of spiritual transmission ( silsilah ) passed down from one spiritual preceptor, called a shaykh in Arabic and a pir in Persian, to another. All of the silsilah trace back to the original silsilah of the Prophet Mohammed through Abu Bakr or th e fourth Kalif Ali. Some of the chains of initiation are still anchored in living masters who transmit the genuine b’rakha (blessing of spiritual potency) of mystical gnosis to their aspirants ( mureed ). Others have become “a name without a reality.” Congr egations of Sufis convene with their shaykhs in specially designated halls (Persian, khanqah ; Arabic, zawiya ; Turkish, tekke ) . Sufis are, with a few notable exceptions, devout Muslims. Yet, Sufism is generally eschewed and viewed with suspicion by the Sunnite and Shiite Islamic orthodox authorities. Like the vast majority of mainstream Muslims, Sufis generally do not participate in or endorse the extreme agenda of radical ultra-orthodox fundamentalists. In addition to the Qur’an , the Sufis have a rich and prolific mystical literature filled with sublime mystical allusions and brilliant allegories. Like the Chasidim, teaching stories and sayings are important vehicles for the transmission of Sufi teachings. The Mathnavi of Jalal ad Din ar-Rumi (d.1273) is often called the “ Qur’an of Persia,” which opens with the story of the reed that has become separated from its reed bed. 26 The Sufis are also known for the exqui site spiritual love poetry of Hafiz, Kabir, Ra’bia, and others. 27 The Conference of the Birds ( Mantiq at-Ta’ir ) by Farid ad-Din ‘Attar, Yusuf and Zulaika by Jami, and the Rose Garden ( Galistan ) by Sa’adi are masterful works of mystical allegory. 28 All Sufis use the symbol of the rose as an allusion to contemplative practice. 29 Sufism has also been enriched by numerous mystical commentaries, such as the Niche for Lights ( Mishkat al Anwar ) by Al Ghazzali (d.1111), and the recorded teachings of Sufi masters such as Rumi, Ibn ‘Arabi, al- Suhrawardi, Ibn ‘Ata Allah, Al Ba yazid Al Bistami, Al Junaid of Bagdad, Abdul Qadir al Jilani, Al Hallaj and others. 30 We st e r n alchemy was derived in great measure from the writings of a number of Sufis concerning the mystical analogy of the purification and transfor mation of metals into the stone of unity, known as the “Philosopher’s Stone.” 31"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"33 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% The mystical worldview of Sufism, as delineated in the Qur’an , is basically identical to the qabalistic worldview rooted in the To r a h . As with the Qabalah, someone new to the study of Sufism will find a plethora of specialized and abstract terminology used to describe its mystical worldview. The challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that there are equivalent words for Sufi term inology in Persian, Arabic, and Turkish. The Sufis have their own version of the Tree of Life, names for the four worlds, terms for the various bodies or shells, and terms for states ( hal ) and stations of consciousness ( maqam ) that correspond closely to those in the Mystical Qabalah. The name for the Divine Presence dwelling among embodied souls in the worlds of matter, for instance, is called Shekhinah in the Qabalah and Sakinat in Sufism. It is also used in the Qur’an ( Surah 2:249) in the same context as it is found in To r a h S h m o t h 24:22, when referring to the Divine Presence residing between the Kerubim over the Ark of the Covenant. The doctrines identified earlier as dualism, qualified non-dualism, and pure non-dualism are differentiated in Sufism as three phases on the Path, known as makhafah (way of fear), machabah (way of love), and ma’rifah (way of knowledge). The activity in these three phases can be correlated respectively with the yogic practices associated with karma yoga (way of purification through selfless service), bhakti yoga (way of devotion), and jnana yoga (way of direct knowledge of the Divine Source). The mystical teachings, literature, and history of the Sufi orders are subjects of extraordinary breadth far beyond the range of this book, and have been documented in critical detail by other authors. 32 Like Mystical Qabalists, Sufis have a wide range of spiritual practices. They are known to vary their teachings and the practices they prescribe according to circumstances. They maintain the view that it is the alchemy between the teacher and those being taught that produces a teaching that is appropriate for the particular time, place, and people involved. Sufis have their own lists of Divine Names or Attributes, which they recite as a regular component of their spiritual practices. One list is composed of ninety-nine Names, and another one of a thousand and one. Many of the Names in the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E 30 the Names) are also found in the Qur’an . In the same way that the Name hvhy is a central element in the meditation and ancillary practices of many Qabalists, most Sufi meditation practices center upon the Name Allah , the principal Divine Name in the Qur’an (see Figure 1.2). The Name Allah is found in the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) as Aleh ( hla lit. these), with one Lamed l instead of two. The addition of the second Lamed l extends the Name into Asiyah (qabalistic World of Activity). \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0015#\u0017 Name Allah The silent and oral recitation ( dikhr ) of the “Affirmation of Unity” ( La Illaha Il Allah ), which is the root mantra at the foundation of Islam, is a core pr actice of all Sufis. The various orders can often be distinguished by the way that they do this. Moses Maimomades, the oft-cited author of The Guide for the Perplexed , regarded the Affirmation of Unity of the Qur’an as essentially equal to the Affirmation of Unity of the To r a h , “ Shem Ayin Yisrael hvhy Elohenu hvhy EchaD. ” Maimomedes made this declaration actually believing this to be the case, and not just because the alternative was death. Sufis are also known for movement practices, called dervis hes, which vary from order to order. 33 These dervishes usually involve some combination of movement, breath, and repetition of Divine Names. The Jewish Kabbalist Abraham Abulafia may very well have adopted some of the head movements he empl oyed with letter visualization practices from the Sufis who were his contemporaries in Spain. 34"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0005 ,\u0003-,\" \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0005 \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011' \u001e-\u0006\u0005 \u0011* '0*\u0002' \u0011\u0006 \u0002'\u0006-\u0002 Some Qabalists believe that the Semitic mystical tradition reached well beyond the geographical boundaries of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley. Archeological evidence has shown that the trade routes between the Tigris-Euphrates and the Indus Valleys were actively traversed as early as 10,000 BCE. 35 When the Indian Buddhists went to China, they were made privy by its rulers to old Chinese texts that described voyages of large junks from the South China Seas to India (at a time when the Saraswati River still ran all the way to the sea), to the Sinai Peninsula, down the western African coast, and beyond. In ancient times, traders were largely the principal conduits for transmitting a variety of information among diverse cultures, including mystical information. It is highly likely that such information traveled to and from the Indus Valley and the Sinai Peninsula along such ancient merchant routes. The arm of historical certainty as yet does not reach very far back in human history, but more and more information is coming to light that confirms worldwide sea travel by ancient Chinese, Mediterranean, and Indonesian cultures long before the relatively recent “discoveries” made by Western Europeans. In the Lech Lecha section of Torah B’reshith (the Book of Genesis, named “ B’reshith ” after its first word tysarb ), several generations of Abraha m’s children by Keturah and a number of his concubines are listed. Abraham divided up the branches of his family, “giving them gifts” and sending those children by his concubines “east to the east country.” 36 One interpretation of this passage holds that “east country” refers to an area in Syria or Jordan. Another theory postulates that these children of Abraham emigrated east to India over long established sea or overland trade routes, where they established the monotheistic religion of Shiva / Shakti long before the invasion of the Aryans down from the Persian steppes. The sea route could have gone through the Gulf of Aqaba, down the Red Sea, through the Gulf of Aden along the coast of Yemen and Oman, across the Arabian Sea to the mouth of the Indus River, and up into the Indus Valley. In India, this religion is called Tantra , and is often referred to in the West as “ the Tantras .” When the Aryans invaded Northern India in the fourteenth"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"8 \u0003\u0001-\u0013\u0007\u0011F\u0012E 3\u0016 century BCE, they encountered a dark-skinned people inhabiting the Sandya Hills above the Indus Valley, for whom the Tantric traditions and rituals of Shiva / Shakti were centuries old. The Tantric tradition is one of the most poorly understood and misrepresented of the world’s mystical traditions. The written books of the Tantras (called Tantra Shastra ), such as the Mahanirvana Tantra and the Satchakracidrupini , are distinct from the Vedic/Upanishadic literature of the Sanatana Dharma . 37 Many of the primary names of the Divine in the Tantras, such as Shiva and Kali , are also found in the Hebrew To r a h . The map of the Sefiroth (lit. Spheres) in the Tree of Life ( etz ha-chayyim ) and the map of the Chakras (lit. Wheels) of the Tantras have much in common. The Kundalini spoken of in the Tantras and the Shekhinah of the Qabalah appear to have the same function. The Kundalini is described as a coiled snake asleep at the base of the Chakric Tree. On page 12 of the Introduction to Tantra Shastra , Sir John Woodroffe says: “ Kundalini means ‘coiled.’ Hence, Kundalini , whose form is that of a coiled serpent, means ‘that which is coiled.’ She is the luminous vital energy ( Jivashakti ) which manifests as prana [ed. same as qi in Chinese, and ruach in Hebrew]. She sleeps in the Muladhara Chakra [Sefirah Kingdom], and has three and a half coils corresponding in number with the three and half bindus (knots). When, after closing the ears, the sound of Her hissing is not heard, then death approaches.” 38 Both the Chakric Tree (see Figure 1.3) and the qabalistic Tree of Life (see Figure 3.5 on page 89) have three structural channels. The central channel on the Chakric Tree is called the “ Shushumna .” The central channel on the qabalistic Tree is denoted as the “Central Column.” The side channels on the Chakric Tree are called the “ Ida ” and the “ Pingala ;” and on the qabalistic Tree, the “Columns of the Right and the Left.” The side channels play a much more prominent role in the Qabalah than they do in the Tantras."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"3+ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0015#\u0018 Chakra System The Kundalini, as Chitshakti (the energy of consciousness), awakens and ascends the Chakric Tree, opening the Chakric lotuses along the Sushumna on Her way to unite with Her Husband Shiva in the Ajna Chakra at the forehead. The ascent by the Kundalini is also called the Satchakrabheda , the “Piercing of the Six Centers.” In the Chintamanistava , attributed to the incarnate sage Sri Shankaracharya, it says: “This family woman ( Kundalini ), entering the royal road ( Shushumna , Central Column of the Tree), taking rest at intervals in the secret places ( Chakras , Sefiroth ), embraces the Supreme Spouse (in the Ajna Chakra , forehead center) and makes the nectar to flow (in the Sahasrara Chakra , Sefirah Crown/Above).” 39 The ascent of the Tree of Life by the Shekhinah is called Shabat ( tbs , Sabbath).

This is echoed in the song of Rabbi Yitza’aq Luria, commonly found in Hebrew prayer books: “ Lekah Dodee Likraht Calah Penay Shabat neQabalah. ” (“Come my Beloved to meet the Bride, Face of Sabbath to receive.”) 40 The meditation practices employed by both Mystical Qabalists and Tantrikas involve a coordinated use of mantra and yantra . Mantra are sequences of Divine Names having great intrinsic power to transform consciousness, and yantra are visualizations that correlate directly and specifically to the mantra . Anthropomorphic descriptions of the Lord hvhy are usually allusions to mysteries and to states and stations of consciousness. Such anthropomorphic allusions are likewise profuse in the Tantras. The Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist Tantric traditions are particularly noted for their explicit sexual allusions to mystical states. Similar allusions are found in the Idra Zuta Qadusha ( Lesser Holy Assembly ) and other qabalistic literature. Also, some Qabalists engage in potent yogic sexual practices similar to those performed by the Virabhava Tantrikas and Chinese Taoist alchemists. 41 Unfortunately, the sexual disciplines (which are just one component of the Tantric tradition overall) are poorly understood, dangerous, and have long suffered from corruption and exploitation.

In the Big Bang model, this universe originated in a quantum fluctuation that generated an immense explosion of tremendous mass (10 58 , or in the more technical parlance, 10E58 grams) contained in an infinitesimally small space (10E-33 cm). As the universe expanded and cooled, clouds of plasma accumulated through which gravity waves pa ssed and ignited thermonuclear fires that generated suns. The suns eventually consume a critical amount of mass through the proces s of nuclear fission, whereby they either burn out or assume new forms. The universe continues to expand in a fou r-dimensional space-time continuum until it reaches a point where it starts to contract and return to its original condition. The expansion of the “Everlasting Arms” that connect the six Directional Sefiroth to one another around the periphery of the double pyramid Tree of Life delineated in the Sefer Yetzirah , and the movement of the Chayot in the Chariot of the Book of Ezekiel allude to the same idea. In the Hindu holy books known as the Vedas , we find another analogy to modern cosmology in the comparison of the Creator to a spider that weaves a web and then retrieves it back into its body. The mentor in the Work of the Chariot Trust speculated further on the correlation between Torah B’reshith 1:1-4 and modern scientific cosmology. His exegesis is presented in Appendix B. It is based upon a different breakdown of the letter sequence of the first line of Torah B’reshith . This breakdown includes an alternative rendering of the first word of the To r a h as “ Bara-shith ” i.e. “IT created Six,” reflecting the six symmetry breaks of modern quantum physics. 42 Some other authors have also speculated on the correlation between qabalistic formulations and the com ponents of particle physics. 43 Another core idea in modern cosmology that finds its counterpart in qabalistic doctrin e is that time is relative and subject to compression and expa nsion. The first chapter of To r a h B’reshith describes the “Seven Days of Creation.” In Zohar B’reshith , it says that the entire cycle of Creation is contained in the first verse of Torah B’reshith .

The implication of this idea is that the sequence of events in Torah B’reshith , all of which are assumed to occur in one plane of existence, actually manifest as a nonlinear space-time sequence occurring in more than one plane. Time-space is exponentially expans ive in each successive plane of existence. Perhaps the reader has had the experience of an elaborate dream that seemed to span a long period of time, maybe years, only to wake up and find out that it actually occurred in a manner of minutes. Consider also the oft-told story of a person seeing their entire life “pass before their eyes” in a near-death episode. From the perspective of a multi-plane, time-space sequence of events, one could conceive of the Great Flood described in the parable of Noah in Torah B’reshith as an allusion to a great solar cycle spanning approximately six billion years in matter. During that cycle, the Sun consumes its mass and eventually expands into a Red Giant, enveloping the planets that it had created, including the Earth. Then, the Sun (known as Elohim in Hebrew and Brahma in Sanskrit) contracts its mass, reconstitutes its core, and spins off a new planetary system in which life is created and evolves. Within the qabalistic worldview, the forty days that Noah is said to have spent in the Ark occurs two planes removed in the World of B’riyah (Crea tion). The genetic information regarding Noah and his wife and all fauna and flora thereby existed in a formless state, as vibrational signatures in the World of B’riyah (Creation). This information then reemerged with the regeneration of life on the planetary mass in the World of Asiyah (Activity in Matter). This extraordinary idea is also found in ancient Sanskrit texts in the account of the incarnation of Vishnu as Matsya the Fish, where the Flood is called Pralaya (“Dark Night of Brahma ”)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"0\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003%"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"\u0001\t\u000b\f\r\u000e \u0017 \u0001\t\u000b\f\r\u000e\u0017 \u001d\u0014\u001c\u0012\u000e\b\u000b\u0011\u0014\u0015\u0011\f\u0007\b\u0011\t\u000b\f\r\u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011\u0001\u000f\u0019\u000f\u0010\u000f\u0007 * '\u0006-\u001e0 \u0016\u0006*\u001e' The primary texts that are largely the source for the core ideas, meditation practices, and all the various forms of the Tree of Life in the Mystical Qabalah are listed below. Primary texts include those revealed through messiahs, prophets, and great masters. Secondary texts are commentaries upon primary texts. During and since the Middle Ages, European Jewish Kabbalists, especially in Spain, Lithuania, and Poland, wrote a considerable body of secondary qabalistic literature. For the purposes of this book, however, we will limit our attention to earlier primary works, with the notable exception of the Etz HaChayyim ( Tree of Life ) of Rabbi Yitza’aq Luria. The Lurianic material has wide regard among contemporary relig ious students of the Jewish Kabbalah, and yields some unique forms of the Tree of Life not found in the earlier primary texts. The Work of the Chariot study group focused upon the following primary texts: • the Sefer HaTorah ( Books of the Law , so-called “Five Books of Master Mosheh”) •the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) of Master Adam • the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ), manual on the Hebrew letters written by Master Abraham • the Sefer HaZohar ( Book of Splendor) , five volume exegesis on the Torah dictated by Rabbi Shimeon Ben Yochai; and more specifically, the Zohar ’s innermost core texts, the Sifra Detzniyutha ( Book of THAT Which is Concealed ), the Idra Rabba Qadusha ( Greater Holy Assembly ), and the Idra Zuta Qadusha ( Lesser Holy Assembly )"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"03 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% • the Ma’aseh Merkabah (“Work of the Chariot”) material from the Nabiyim ( The Prophets) , the remaining remnants of the Seferim HaChanokh ( Books of Enoch ben Yared ), and the Shi’r Qoma ( Measure of the Divine Body ) from the Sefer Raziel HaGadol ( Book of the Secrets of Raziel the Great ) • the Qur’an , the song of Allah transmitted through Master Mohammed • the Peshitta ( Gospels , including the Gospel of Thomas ) describing the life and teachi ngs of Master Yeshuvah, and the Revelation of John • the Etz HaChayyim ( Tree of Life ) dictated by Rabbi Yitza’aq Luria to Chayyim Vital. \u0001 \u001d\u001e\u001d\u001f ! \u0005\u0006 \" \u000f #\u001f\"\u0006 \u0011&\u0003 \u001e\u001e$\u001d \u0011 \u001e. \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\u0004 \u0002\" ( The five component books of the To r a h ( hrvt ) are conventionally known outside of Judaism as Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , and Deuteronomy .

Their work appears to have been combined and assembled in a fina l redaction in the fifth century BCE (though no scrolls from that time have yet to be found). Whether the present version is the cumulative work of multiple writers or not, tradition ascribes the final redaction to Ezra the Scribe. The compilation required the writer(s) to collect, record, and assemble a large cor pus of material from disparate sources. It is impossible to know how much of the text was passed down over the many centuries in written form, but it still would have been susceptible to errors of transcription, omission, etc. It is likely that a substantial amount, if not the majority, of the information was handed down as an oral tradition of teaching stories that skillfully mingled historical facts with miraculous acts. Such a rendition would have been even more vulnerable to corruption, embellishments and outright fictionalization. While it is highly unlikely that the current version of the To r a h is an accurate version of the Ezra compilation, the living tradition of the Mystical Qabalah provides us with keys by which we can mine for the original treasures still embedded within it. Ultimately, the divinely infused life of Master Mosheh was a vehicle for the renewal and enlivenment of the underlying mystical spirituality regarding the absolute unity of existence and the primacy of unconditional devotion and love for the Divine that had faded in the hearts of Israel. Despite arguments from religious Jews, there is extensive archeological evidence of a much older Hebrew alphabet, called Gezer or Sinatic (after Mt. Sinai), as the original and most ancient Hebrew (see “Hebrew-English Transliteration” facing page 11). Sinatic Hebrew is in fact the oldest known alphabet, suddenly appearing about the time of Abraham (circa 1850 BCE). The original Sinatic Hebrew became virtually extinct after the decimation of Lachish circ a 701 BCE. The Sinatic alphabet could have evolved as an alphabe tic representation of the twenty- six Sumerian cuneiform ciphers, the world’s oldest known non- alphabetic language. 2 By the time the current To r a h was redacted, the original Sinatic Hebrew alphabet had long been extinct.

As a solution, the final redactor (i.e. Ezra) chose to record the To r a h in a new alphabet that would be more recognizable to the generations of Jews who had long forgotten the original. It was derived by using the twenty-two letter format of the old Hebrew alphabet, with letter forms synthesized from the familiar alphabets of the Palmyrene and Nabataen dialects of Aramaic extant in Palestine at that time (Figure 2.1 on page 58). Since Ezra is credited with the final redaction of the reconstructed To r a h , this alphabet shall henceforth be referred to as “Ezra Hebrew.” The oldest existing scrolls of the Hebrew To r a h were written many centuries after the time of Ezra, so we can not be certain that the ones we have now are completely faithful to the original ascribed to him. Historically, there are three parallel textual traditions that have contributed substantially to the way the To r a h is composed and translated. Most Jews now read the Masoretic version of the To r a h . The Masoretic Hebrew text dates from the fourth century CE and the earliest surviving copy is from the tenth century CE. 3 The Greek translation of the Tanakh , called the Septuagint , was made under Ptolemy in the third century BCE, and the oldest copy is centuries older than the oldest full Masoretic text. 4 The Septuagint became the authoritative text for Christianity as it became estranged from its Jewish roots. The Samaritan To r a h evolved during the period after the Assyrians conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, and forcibly resettled many different peoples there. The three source versions vary in a number of details. The Masoretes created the first system of vowels placed below the Hebrew consonants in the sixth or seventh century CE, thereby moving to standardize the pronunciation of the words and formalizing the structure of the grammar. Until then, even though the pronunciations and meanings had been passed down orally for centuries, the way Hebrew verb roots are parsed left considerable room for ambiguities. As early as the first century BCE, scribes began employing conventions to reduce such ambiguities. The conventions generally involved inserting consonants as vowels to aid reading. 5 Then, between the sixth"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 0\u0016 and twelfth centuries CE, the Ma soretes and Tiberians edited the definitions of many of the Hebrew words found in the To r a h . The letterforms of the Sinati c and Ezra Hebrew alphabets bear little physical resemblance to one another, though they share the same twenty-two-letter format and have the same names for the letters. Hence, the Sinatic Hebrew letter Alef transliterates with the Ezra Alef a , the Sinatic Beyt with the Ezra Beyt b , and so forth. Sinatic letterforms are basically built from the letters Alef and Ayin . Ezra Hebrew letter forms are built upon variations of the letter Yod y . Both alphabets have letters which overtly or covertly contai n other letters, such as the Tav contained in the Sinatic Alef or the Beyt b contained in the Ezra Alef a (as described in the Sefer Bahir ) . 6 Unlike the Ezra alphabet, Sinatic does not ha ve final letters, which were developed much later as a means of showing separation between words in crowded scrolls. The final letters became significant in the Ezra alphabet when given extended numerical value in gematria or qabalistic numerology. 7 The sudden appearance of the original Hebrew was paralleled several hundred years later by the sudden appearance of Brahmi Sanskrit in the Indus Valley. Sinatic and Brahmi have many similar letterforms, and both were replaced by later alphabets claimed in present times to be the originals (i.e. Sinatic replaced by Ezra and Brahmi replaced by Deva Negari). Some Qabalists and Tantrikas maintain that there is a parent alphabet, called the “ Gan Aden Alphabet” ( ]da ]g , Garden of Eden), from which both Hebrew and Sanskr it are derived. A speculative representation of the Gan Eden Alphabet composed of twenty- two families of letters with an aggregate of seventy members is seen in Figure 2.2 on page 59. There is also said to be a Gan Aden Torah , an unbroken sequence of le tters that may be broken into words and sentences in innumerable ways. Hence, the written To r a h is one such “translation” of the unbroken letter sequence, minus the letters and anusvara that were not included in the Hebrew alphabet. 8 A book called the Tiqunim HaZohar (“Perfections of Splendor”) discusses seventy ways of translating the first six letters of the To r a h . 9 The To r a h contains many power names, mantra, and visual imagery suitable for use in yogic meditation.

As such, it is a valuable key that can help open locks guarding the mysteries that lay hidden in Hebrew (and Arabic) qabalistic books, and provides Names of Power by which one can light the entire Tree. Secondly, it is the primary source of “Angelic Tree Language,” comprised of one series of Tree-maps that allude to distinctly different paths of ascension through the planes of consciousness, and a second series that allude to different stations of perfected souls who have completed the ascension. It is said that Adam gave the book to his son Seth and it was then passed down the generationa l line to Enoch son of Yared. When Enoch ascended and “walked with Elohim, ” he took the book with him. The Sefer HaShmoth came back into the world again with the Covenant of Abraham. 11 Abraham gave the book to Ishmael, Isaac, and his offspring by his concubines. 12 Isaac’s copy was handed down to Master Mo sheh and was later sealed in the vault of the first Temple of Jerusalem. Buried in the Temple vault, access to the book was limited to those who had the psychic skill to “see/read” it in Yetzirah (Astral World of Formation), and the strength to survive the impact of its power without shattering their shells. 13 The powerful Sefer HaShmoth resurfaced in the early 1970’s, when it was transmitted through the gentleman responsible for the creation of the Work of the Chariot Trust. For a series of nights, he would awaken in the early hours and record the succession of Sinatic Hebr ew Divine Names and Trees of Life he would see as intense light patterns, using the level of psychic mediation described in the Sefer HaZohar ( Book of Splendor ) as “One-Twentieth Cloudy Mirror.” (The various designations regarding the mirror of consciousness in the Zohar refer to different degrees of vision. “Clear Mirror” denotes the consciousness of Messiah. “Dull” or “Cloudy Mirror” denotes the vision of Prophets. “One-T wentieth Cloudy Mirror” denotes"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 4\u0015 the conscious dream state and “One-Sixtieth Cloudy Mirror” the normal dream state.)

Many scholars attribute a medieval or Hasmonean date to the book. It is not in the scope of the present work to delineate the varied opinions that attribute a medieval date to the book’s inception. The references to the “Book of Abraham” in the Qur’an (see Surahs 87:19 and 53:37) may allude to this book or some version of it. If that is the case, since the Qur’an predates the medieval period by centuries, it would at least substantiate that the Sefer Yetzirah is not of medieval origin.

The Sefer Yetzirah is the first mystical manual on, and possibly the source text for, the original Hebrew alphabet. Its chapters explain the significance of the twenty-two letters and ascribe various attributes to them. It is second only to the Sefer HaShmoth as the most prolific source of distinct forms of the Tree of Life. The first chapter of the book is the earliest known textual source for the six-pointed symbol known as the “Star of David.” The Six-Pointed Star has co me to be seen as a flat, two- dimensional symbol of two interlocking triangles. The Sefer Yetzirah , however, presents the Star as a three-dimensional, six- pointed form of the Tree of Life comprised of two interfacing pyramids. The Sefer Yetzirah provides one of the two vastly different sets of names commonly found in the Qabalah for the spheres (called Sefiroth) on the Tree (the other set comes from the Sefer HaZohar ). The names for the Sefiroth in the Sefer Yetzirah are based on elements (Spirit of Living Elohim , Air, Fire, Water), on four “Celestial Heads of Messiah,” and on the six directions. These and the other correspondences that the book gives for the spheres and gates on the Tree will be discussed in detail later in the book Like the three innermost core texts of the Sefer HaZohar , the Sefer Yetzirah stands out within primary qabalistic literature for the depth, terseness, and obscuri ty of its language, and for its wealth of mystical allusions. For a Mystical Qabalist, the book’s power and value are valid independent of academic considerations regarding its origins.

Hence, there are also those who would take the intermediary position that De Leon redacted and published a work that had a much earlier time of origin. The text of the Zohar is presented as a series of dialogues among a group of rabbis. These rabbis were the embodiments of the various Sefiroth (spheres) on the Tree of Life. Hence, the “flavor” of the respective Sefirah (sphere) colors each rabbi’s remarks and questions. Like the Sefer Yetzirah , the Zohar has its own distinct set of names for the Sefiroth, most of which come from the Sefer HaShmoth , and are later echoed in the To r a h and Ketuvim ( Writings ). Those names may be described as various qualities of the Divine, such as Wisdom, Beauty, Glory, and Mercy. The Zoharic names for the Sefiroth are the most commonly known and used among all types of Qabalists. The body of the five volumes of the Zohar emanates from a core of three extraordinary text s. The innermost layer and heart of the Zohar is a small text called the Sifra Detzniyutha ( Book of THAT Which is Concealed ). This book contains the single greatest exposition on the negatively existent Mysterious Unknown (called Ayn, and also “The NOT”) among all written works of the Mystical Qabalah. The next layer of the core of the Zohar is a text called Idra Rabba Qadusha ( Greater Holy Assembly ), or simply Idra Rabba ; and the third layer of the core is called Idra Zuta Qadusha ( Lesser Holy Assembly ), or simply Idra Zuta . The Idra Rabba and Idra Zuta expand greatly upon the anthropomorphic allusions introduced in the Sifra Detzniyutha . The “Greater Holy Assembly” is the entire Tree of ten Sefiroth. The “Lesser Holy Assembly” is the upper seven Sefiroth only. The profound ideas and wonderful mystical allusions presented in the three core texts will be discussed in detail later on."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"43 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% ! \" \u0011 \"\u0001\u001d\u0006 \u0005! \u001d\u001f%\"\u0010\"\u0006 \u0011&\u0016 \u0005\u0002-*\u001e\u0006 (\u0011\u0004 *\u0006,-\u0002\u0006 -, Among the principal works of the written Qabalah, significant material is devoted to the description of the Celestial Chariot ( hbkrm , Merkabah ), or “Throne of Glory of El Shadai .” The Chariot is generally an allusion to the Tree of Life, and especially to the four Sefiroth in the central matrix of the three-dimensional Tree of Perfection. These four are collectively referred to as the “Inner Court” of the Tree. The Lord hvhy is variously said to be “riding in the Chariot” and “seated upon the Throne” in the similitude of a man (i.e. Adam Kadmon , the “Celestial Man”). In the Ketuvim ( Writings ) of the Jewish scripture (called Tanakh ), this material is concentrated in the books of Ezekiel 1-3, 8, 10 and Isaiah 6. Specific verses in these books yield a three-dimensional, six-pointed form of the Tree similar to the one delineated by the Sefer Yetzirah . Each of these Tree forms contains distinctly different representations of the four Inner Court Sefiroth. The Chariot Tree will be described in more detail when all the forms of the Trees yielded by the respective primary texts are presented in Chapters Four and Five. The most prolific descriptions of the Merkabah appear in the Books of Enoch . Enochian literature takes its name from Enoch son of Yared. Enoch was “a righte ous man in his generation” and “walked with Elohim .” 16 It is believed that in ancient times there may have been as many as 100,000 volumes of Enochian literature, nearly all of whose last remains were lost in the fiery destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria. This literature was virtually unknown from the f ourth (when banned by Hilary, Jerome, and Augustus) until the late nineteenth century CE, when three manuscripts deemed as authentic Enochian material were discovered. Two of the manuscripts, I Enoch and III Enoch , were in Ethiopian translation: these were found in what was once Abyssinia, the domain of King Solomon’s infamous lover, the Queen of Sheba. The third manuscript, called II Enoch and the “ Book of the Secrets of Enoch ,” was preserved in two Slavonic versions: these were found in Russia and Serbia. I Enoch and II Enoch were translated by R.H. Charles. H. Odeburg translated III Enoch ( “ Hebrew Book of Enoch ” ) . 17 The Books of Enoch that are mentioned here should not be confused with the “Canons of Enoch,” which were discovered"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 40 and translated into European languages in the early nineteenth century. These latter books, which influenced Romantic artists and poets such as Thomas Moore, William Blake, and Lord Byron, are from a different tradition. The authorship and dates of origin of the remaining Enochian books are obscure. The three manuscripts cited, replete with errors of addition, corruption, and omission, may well be the remnants of volumes given to Sheba by King Solomon and subsequently handed down through generations. At the very least, biblical scholars agree that the Books of Enoch are the most important Apocrypha and Pseudoepigrapha pre-dating the Christian era. It has been well established that all New Testament authors were more or less influenced by them. 18 The translations of the three Books of Enoch had been long out of print by the time the Work of the Chariot Trust republished them in the early 1970’s. The texts address a wide range of topics. There are numerous messianic references, extensiv e angeologies and demonologies, elaborate descriptions of the va rious heavens and hells, lists of Divine Names, lists of names of Metatron , and allusions to mystical states associated with ascending the Tree. The most prominent Merkabah sections describe the ascension and transformation of Enoch ben Yared into Metatron , known as “The Youth” ( rn , Nar ) to whom the Lord hvhy revealed the deepest secrets, and whom the Lord hvhy made the “operational manager” of this universe. 19 Metatron , chief of the angels, is referred to in the Tanakh (notably in Proverbs 22.6 and Job 32.6), as well as the Zohar (I.223b). III Enoch , the “ Hebrew Book of Enoch ,” contains a long discourse on the ascension of the Celestial Chariot by Rabbi Ishmael, the last High Priest before the destruction of the first Temple of Jerusalem. The ascension of Rabbi Ishmael drew vigorous protests from some of the high angels, who objected to the admission of his relatively impure human spirit to the supernal World of Emanation (called Atziluth ). When high angels get too close to the supernal Sefiroth in the World of Atziluth, their wings burn. The ascension by Rabbi Ishmael of the Celestial Chariot is a narrative allegory for the mystical ascent of the Central Column of the Tree."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"44 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Another obscure but important treatise included among Merkabah literature is the Sefer Raziel HaGadol (Book of Raziel the Great ) , 20 which contains a subtext within it called the Sh’ir Qoma or “ Measure of the Divine Body .” The Sh’ir Qoma presents copious lists of Divine Names and, uniquely, a series of dimensions ascribed to the “Divine Body” or Yo s h e r ( rsy , lit. upright) form of the Name hvhy (Figure 2.3). All current Hebrew texts of the Sh’ir Qoma come from a single text, the corrupt edition published by Eleazer of Worms in Amsterdam in 1701 CE. The dimensions given in that text do not yield a reasonable image. The Work of the Chariot Trust published the first, and until recently only, English translation of the Sh’ir Qoma , and included it in its edition of the Books of Enoch . The translator adjusted the dime nsions so that a reasonable Yo s h e r is produced, and the overall size corre lates roughly to the currently accepted size of the sidereal universe. The “ Sh’ir Qoma ” is the vision of the Creation as a unity in the Name hvhy . It is seen when returning from the negatively existent roots of the Tree, looking down at the Sefirah in the throat center from the Sefirah at the crown of the head. The Yo s h e r is a distinctly anthropomorphic form of the Name hvhy . It is encircled by the Leviathan ( ]tyvl ) of Vast Face, described as a “snake devouring its tail.” 21 The Leviathan acts as a circular “fence” around the Yo s h e r and defines the field of superimposition. It also displays the ubiquitous mystical principle that “the end is contai ned in the beginning.” An obscure teaching says that the Yo s h e r drips out from Leviathan’s fang. This is paralleled in the Tantric tradition, where Shiva is described as swallowing the “poi son” of Maya and holding it in his throat. In the Sifra Detzniyutha , we find the verse: “The engraving of all engravings appears as a long serpent. And extends this way and that. The tail is in the head. The head goes around to the shoulders. Passing and indignant. Guarding and concealing, revealing itself in a thousand short days.” 22"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 4\u0016 \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0017#\u0018 Ezra Hebrew Yosher in the Tzimtzum surrounded by Leviathan \u0006 \u0005, \u0011 \u0019 \u001d\u0001\u0006 \u000f\u000f\" \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011- ,8,\u0004\u0002\u0006*\u001e' \u0011 \u001e. \u00113 \u001e\u0005' \u0011 Unlike Master Mosheh and the Prophet Mohammed, Master Yeshuvah did not record a revelation to be handed down after his departure from human form.

His life was his message, and it can only trul y be understood in Jewish terms. Upon interrogation, the Head Rabbi could find no fault in him. What was there to dispute?

In order of importance after the Shema , he cited the root injunction from To r a h to love and acknowledge the innate divinity of all beings: “ Shem Ayn Yisroel hvhy Elohenu hvhy EchaD Vuh-ahavta et hvhy Elohenu, Buh-khol levavkha, Oo-vuh-khol nafshekha, Oo-vuh-khol muhodekha. ” 23 “Name Ayn Israel YHVH Thy Elohim YHVH One. And you shall love YHVH Your Elohim With all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.” Followed by, “ Vuh-ahavta leh-re’akha kamokha .” “And thou shall love your neighbor as your Self.” 24 But when one reads the stories of Master Yeshuvah’s life and teachings as explicated in the four Gospels of the conventional Peshitta , it is no longer a Jewish story that is found there, but preponderantly an admixture of theology developed almost exclusively by Gentiles. Master Yeshuvah had come to reestablish and enliven the universal mystical spirituality that was always present in Judaism, but had become largely forgotten and covered by the dross of wo rldliness and contortions of interpretation. But, his simple and clear message of the absolute unity of all existence, and spiritual awakening through unconditional love and surrender to the Divine, was obscured almost immediately after the passing of his close disciples. A virtual divorce of Christianity from its Jewish roots ensued. Fragmented communities of Christians with different and competing views and agendas quickly crystallized, some composed largely of Palestinian or Hellenistic Jewish Christians, and others of Gentiles from a wide variety of backgrounds whose only knowledge of ancient scripture came from the Greek Septuagint . Starting about forty years after Master Yeshuvah appeared to pass from his physical body, a variety of narratives attributed to close disciples bega n to appear.

Are the four books contained in the current version of the Peshitta accurate renditions of the life and teachings of Master Yeshuvah, as recorded by four of his closest disciples? That would be highly unlikely. Until the Gospel of Mark appeared several years after the destruc tion of the Second Temple in 70 CE, virtually all information concerning Master Yeshuvah was passed down as an oral tradition, largely in the form of sayings (L. logia ) attributed to him. Oral traditions are notoriously prone to distortions and embellishment s. In the next thirty years, different communities of Christians produced narratives in the name of Matthew, Luke, John, and also Thomas. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke could well have been intended to be stand- alone replacements for the Gospel of Mark . The Gospel of Matthew includes 601 verses contained in Mark , either word for word or with carefully crafted changes. Some investigators attribute an additional source for the Gospel of Luke , dubbed the “Q Source.” Support is growing to include the Gospel of Thomas in the Peshitta as one of the original canonized Gospels. 25 The single most prominent source that all four shared was the Greek translation of the Tanakh , called the Septuagint , which the Christians had transformed into a book about Master Yeshuvah well before any of th e gospel narratives appeared. While the Qumran community and other pre-Christian groups read oracular meanings into the Tanakh in a more general sense, the Christians did so in a very specialized way. Long held traditional Jewish meanings for verses in the Tanakh were replaced by forced interpretations that supported Master Yeshuvah as the fulfillment of the To r a h , the writings of the prophets (especially those of Daniel, Isaiah, Micah, and Hosea), and the historical accounts of the kings of Israel. Numerous investigators have pointed out obvious mistranslations and misunderstandings of verses from Tanakh that were appropriated and customized for the biblical justification of gospel narratives. Finally, for various reasons, all of the primary religious texts have suffered from corruption, errors in transcription, omissions,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"\u0016\b ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% and additions as they were passed down over the centuries. The earliest texts of the canonized Gospels only go back to the fourth and fifth centuries CE. So, does this mean that the essential teachings of Master Yeshuvah are lost to the world? Definitely not! Again, it is important to remember that Master Yeshuvah did not come to deliver a new message but to renew an old one. He did not come to replace the To r a h , but to demonstrate its essence through his life. Hence, the Hebrew scriptures, even without interpretations skewed to support a developing theology, and the Mystical Qabalah provide us with the nece ssary keys to identify the many gems placed in the setting of the quasi-fictionalized gospel narratives. The Gospels of John and Thomas , in particular, make it clear that the teachings of Master Yeshuvah were firmly rooted in the continuum of Shemite mystical spirituality. Secondly, there are universal characteristics of messianic appearances that cross all religious boundaries. From time to time in the histories of all religions, the One Ineffable Ground of Being has taken human form to reawaken faith, revitalize the universal teachings upon which they are all based, and renew the efficacy of the succession of Gatekeepers who keep those teachings alive within the respective traditions. Every one of these Messiahs is a manifestation with full power, omniscience, and omnipresence of the same Di vine Source, and yet every one is utterly unique and extraordinary. While many of the appearances of Messiah are accompanied by a written revelation or set of teachings, in each case it may be said that the message they came to bring was demonstrated most directly and most poignantly by their lives. And while each of those life stories was unique, they all shared a number of things in common that we may apply in considering the divine life of Master Yeshuvah. These commonalties will be discu ssed in more detail in Chapter Three in the section on the nature of messianic appearance within the context of the Mystical Qabalah. Finally, like every living tradition, the spiritual power of the transmission does not depe nd primarily upon the written documents, but in the b’rakha (spiritual blessing) of Perfect Trees and the grace of the Divine to quicken one’s Holy Spirit"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u0016\u0015 ( Ruach Ha Qodesh ). Mystical Christianity has maintained a continuous lineage of known and mostly unknown saints and mystics over the centuries, who have faithfully passed on the essence of Master Yeshuvah’s myst ical spirituality. Despite later distrust and suppression by Pauline orthodoxy, mysticism flourished in the early church. Master Yeshuvah taught one set of teachings openly to the public, and another set of secret teachings privately to his most advanced disciples. The Gospels themselves attest to this, and Clement of Alexandria wrote about such a secret teaching as late as the third century CE. Of all the Christian mystical literature, the most enigmatic and passionately discussed is the Revelation of John . It opens with a description of John’s visi on of the Ancient of Days with fiery eyes and a two-edged sword coming from His mouth, etc. The text then goes on to delineate a series of seven sets of seven images. These images have long been regarded as allegorically depicting a linear series of events all occurring in the physical plane, leading to the reemerge nce of Christ, his vanquishing of Satan, and His ascension as the Lamb of God to the Throne on High in the new Jerusalem. However, from the perspective of the Mystical Qabalah, the series of images listed in the Revelation provide an allusion for the process of mystical awakening through the four worlds in the ascension of a specialized version of the single-column “Tree of Life of the Treasuries of the House of Elohim .” The series of images from Revelation are presented in the qabalistic Tree format in Chapter Six. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011 & ' \u0011 \u001f\"\u0015 \u0011 The Qur’an is the final revelation of the Lord hvhy (as Allah ) to the children of Abraham.

Master Mohammed is thought to have had significant interaction with religious teachers from all of these groups, as well as, from the Hanifites, and the highly educated Persian Zoroastrians who ruled many parts of the peninsula. A large amount of critical evidence, beyond the scope of this book, concludes that th is interaction substantially impacted the content of the Qur’an . The Jews had immigrated to the Arabian Peninsula via the well-traveled trade routes across the Red Sea long before Master Mohammed was born. They were largely centered in Mecca and Medina, and included a substantial number of religious teachers well versed in Talmudic halacha (interpretations of verses in To r a h ) and Midrashic commentary (i.e. on the halacha ). The Sabaeans are thought to have be en among the earliest inhabitants of Syria, and only a little is known of their history, culture, and spirituality. The Christian inhab itants consisted largely of the descendants of “heretics” w ho had been expelled from the Roman Empire. These Arabian “desert fathers” possessed numerous apocalyptic and pse udo-epigraphic texts. But it is suspected that they had limited knowledge of the Peshitta , and that the bulk of the material related to the Prophet Isa (Master Yeshuvah) and Miryam (Mary) in the Qur’an was derived from Jewish sources. The Hanifites were an Arabian faith community largely concentrated in Mecca, Medina, and a few other cities, who had rejected idolatry previ ous to the birth of the Prophet. They professed to be in search of the original religion of Abraham. In the Qur’an , Master Mohammed repeatedly applies the term “ hanif ” to the disciples of the religion of Abraham. Before and during Master Mohamme d’s life, Persian kings ruled many parts of the peninsula. The Persian inhabitants were generally well educated, and their tales and songs became widespread among the Arabian tribes. The poetic and narrative style of the Qur’an is strikingly different from the Tanakh . The Tanakh is a diverse anthology whose component pieces were written at different times for religious instruction by a number of different consummate storytellers. Their work was selectively preserved and handed down as the best of their kind, culminating in their inclusion in the Ezra redaction of the Tanakh .

It was an inspired scripture delivering a fresh transmission of the universal mystical spirituality of the religion of Abraham. It was intended to bring the descendants of Ishmael out of their long decline into idol worship, as well as, lead the Jews and the Christians back to the spiritual truth that had become buried under orthodox conventions, fictionalized narr atives, forced meanings, and outside cultural distortions. While characters in the To r a h are highly developed and distinct, those in the Qur’an come forth with little development and repeat the same fundamental axioms. While biblical narratives are complete stories rich with dramatic action, the narratives in the Qur’an are fragmentary, with incidents and scenes from Jewish and Christian history introduced abruptly, with little dramatic sense, and often lacking important points that would enhance the reader’s understanding. However, the unique and complex circumstances into which the Prophet brought forth his new dispensation didn’t require that he repeat the entirety of the biblical narrative. There was a long history of hostilities and distrust among the various Arab tribes. The Jews and the Christians had been estranged for centuries. His fragmentary approach was enough to give the Arabs a sense of ownership of the religion of their ancestors, while providing a vehicle to carry the core mystical concept of the absolute unity of all existence at the roots of all the traditions. The 114 surahs of the Qur’an are typically divided into those revealed in the early period in Mecca, those revealed in the middle period in Medina, and those that came in the later period in Mecca. As a rule, the shortest and most mystically potent surahs are associated with the early period in Mecca. Longer surahs from later periods were more loosely structured, allowi ng the Prophet to make changes as circumstances unfolded, and insert new verses as he deemed appropriate. Thus, the Qur’an presented both an opportunity to reestablish the unitive mystical spirituality of the children of Abraham in general, as well as, gave the Prophet the guise of revelation to resolve many tribal disputes.

The similitude of His light is that of a niche, 27 within which is a lamp. 28 The lamp is within a glass orb. 29 The glass, as it were, a shining star, 30 Lit with the oil of a blessed olive tree, NOT of the East, NOT of the West. Its light luminous even though fire touches it not, Light upon light.” 31 and, later in the surah , “Or like darkness upon a vast ocean, 32 Covered with waves upon waves, Over them clouds, Darkness upon thick darkness. 33 And whoever Allah gives NOT- Light, has NOT- Light in all.” In Islam, Judaism and Christianity are regarded as revealed religions, and therefore given protected status. In the Qur’an , there are a number of references to the Jews as the “People of the Book (i.e. To r a h )” whom Muslims are exhorted to honor and respect. In the “Most High Surah ,” the To r a h is called the “Book of Mosheh” and the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ) is referred to as the “Book of Abraham.” The Qur’an also has beautiful surahs devoted to the Prophet Isa (Master Yeshuvah), to whom is ascribed the exalted stature of rasool (prophet of the highest degree), and to Isa’s mother Miryam (Mary). It is interesting to note that in the history of Miryam, Master Mohammed speaks of Miryam, si ster of Aaron the High Priest"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"\" \u0011F\u0007\u0001\u0006\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u00160 and Master Mosheh, as the same Miryam who became the mother of Master Isa 1570 years later.

He is widely known as “HaAri” (The Lion). The expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 set into motion a tide of momentum that led to Safed becoming a center for the revitalized study of the Jewish Kabbalah, in which Luria was a central figure. Rabbi Luria dictated the Etz HaChayyim ( Tree of Life ) to his student Chayyim Vital. It is composed of ten “Branches” and is deeply rooted in the Zohar ( Book of Splendor ). It is clearly the most intellectually complex of the pr incipal works of written Qabalah, and attracts the lion’s share of interest amongst present-day (non- occult) Qabalists. The text of the Etz HaChayyim describes the emanation of the “smooth and simple” Light of the Endless ( rva [vc ]ya , Ayn Sof Or ), from Its unmanifest condition into the pattern of the Sefiroth of the Tree of Life within the “Sphere of Contraction” ( ,vomo , Tzimtzum ). 34 In the Etz HaChayyim , the Central Column of the Tree is called the Kav ( bk , Line of Light), and the names used for the Sefiroth are exclusively Zoharic. The Lurianic cosmogony elucidates a system of partzufim , or “veils,” positioned on the Tree. The Etz HaChayyim is a source for several unique forms of the Tree of Life. One form renders the Sefiroth as a pattern of ten concentric circles, like “layers of an onion.” Two other Trees are set upon a version of the vertical arrangement of the letters of the Name hvhy mentioned in the description of the Sh’ir Qoma ( Measure of the Divine Body ). These Trees will be presented in a later chapter."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"\u00164 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Luria is particularly noted for his doctrine of the Shevirat HaKelim , or the “Shattering of the Vessels.” This doctrine widely influenced many Qabalists w ho followed, including Sabbatai Zevi and the Baal Shem Tov (the father of Chasidism). The core idea of the Shevirat HaKelim is that the universe was shattered at the moment of creation (mirroring the Big Bang Theory). From this inflationary event, “holy sparks” flew off in all directions. Some returned, and others became embodied in all forms of matter. From this arose the idea of Tikkun Olam , or the “Perfection of the World,” in which all the holy sparks return to the state of unity that preceded the creation of the universe. A parallel in Chaos Theory is the concept of a “disturbed system” that strives to revert to a former condition of quasi-stationary equilibrium.

All mystical worldviews are at once unique and yet identical. Since they are open ended, and provide a ladder for the finite human intellect to connect with an infinite Ground of Pure Being that is inherently unfathomable to that intellect, they are usually composed of allegories and allusions transmitted by messiahs, perfect masters, and great sages. Like a ladder that is used to climb up to the roof of a house and then as the means to come back down, a mystical worldview is intended to act as a vehicle for the awakening consciousness to ascend through the planes of existence to unite with the Divine Essence. The worldview becomes a frame of reference for the mind to come back into once the soul returns as an individuated being. The elements of the qabalistic worldview are combined in the grand allusion of the Tree of Life. The Tree emanates from the Mysterious Unknown in its negatively existent roots, and descends through the planes of existence via a series of spheres connected by gates. All mystical traditions have ways for the human intellect to make a distinction between passive and active aspects of the Mysterious Unknown. In the Qabalah, they are respectively called “Vast Face” and “Small Face.” The relationship between the two Faces is portrayed in the Tree of Life. Like most other mystical traditions, the Qabalah has a variety of special Names for each of the two aspects, and a principal Name for the active aspect upon which the entire religious tradition usually centers. In the following sections of this chapter, the core teachings of the Mystical Qabalah that constitute its worldview are presented in detail."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"\u0016+ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0002 #' 4\u00118 \u0002\u001d\u0006 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, 4\u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011\u001d \t\u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0002 #' The Mystical Qabalah describes the roots of the Tree of Life as an ultimate, negatively existe nt substratum of pure Being that is Self-conscious and all blissful. It is described as “negatively existent” in relation to the “positively-existent” four worlds of the Tree of Life. The three roots of the Tree are named: • Ayn ( ]ya lit. Nothing; pronounced “ai-n” as in ‘nine’), • Ayn Sof ( [vc ]ya lit. Without End, or Endless; pronounced “sof” as in ‘sofa’), and • Ayn Sof Or ( rva [vc ]ya lit. Endless Light, or Light of the Endless; pronounced “or” as in ‘oar’). But these are only distinctions in human thought. The negatively existent Absolute Be ing, or shall we say “Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of All Things,” alludes to a depth of consciousness beyond Name and Form, and beyond the finite and supernal aspects of the Tree of Life. Individual consciousness cannot usually sustain this experience at length. In fact, most souls do not return from the experience in the roots. Their shells of embodied existence ( qlifoth ) dissolve completely, and they pass from their physical sheath (i.e. die). In Qabalah, the negatively existent Absolute Being is also called the “NOT” ( al , pronounced “lo” as in “below”). The experience of the “NOT” finds Its counterpart in every mystical tradition. The Sufis refer to the experience as fana ‘l fana ( fana means “extinction”). The Hindus call it nirvikalpa samadhi . The Buddhists call it nirvana , sunyata (emptiness), satori, and anuttara samyak sambodhi (full enlightenment). The Qur’an refers to the Mysterious Unknown by the same terms used in the To r a h . In Arabic, the word for the NOT is “ La ”: this is written , which is virtually identical to the Ezra letter Ayin i . The shape of the Sinatic letter Ayin is also suggestive—it is a circle. Within qabalistic litera ture, the foundational concept of the negatively existent “NOT” ( al ) is most strongly and directly portrayed in the Sifra Detzniyutha ( Book of THAT Which is Concealed )."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u00165 The main body of the text begins: “The Book of THAT Which is Concealed is the book of the balancing in weight.

Until the Head ( sar , Rosh ), desired by all desires, Formed and communicated the Garments of Splendor. That weight arises from the place which is NOT Him. Those who exist as NOT ( al ) are weighed in Ya h hy . In His body exists the weight. NOT ( al ) unites, and NOT ( al ) begins. In Ya h hy have they ascended; who NOT ( al ) are, and are, and will be.” 1 The first chapter of Lao Tze’s Tao-Te Ching opens with verses that address the Mysterious Unknown and Its two aspects: “1.1 The Tao that can be trodden is NOT, the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is NOT, the enduring and unchanging name. 1.2 Conceived of as having no name, It is the originator of Heaven and Earth; conceived of as having a name, It is the Mother of all things. 1.4 Under these two aspects, It is really the same; but as development takes place, It receives the different names.

It is also known as Al ( li lit. upon), Shomer ( rms , Witness, Guardian), Atiqa ( aqyui , Hidden One), Supernal Israel, the Ancient of Days, and other Names found in the Sefer HaShmoth and the To r a h . 3 In the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ), the Ayin i is alluded to as the “Organ of Nakedness.” “Head” ( sar , Rosh ), a word that occurs in the fifth line of the first verse above, is also a Name of Vast Face. Ayin i means “eye,” and in the Idra Rabba Qadusha ( Greater Holy Assembly ) it says: “This is the tradition: Were the Eye closed even for one moment, no thing could subsist. Therefore, It is called the Open Eye, the Holy Eye, the Excellent Eye, the Eye of Fate ( alzm , mazal ), the Eye which sleeps not nor slumbers, the Eye which is the Guardian of all things, the Eye which is the substance of all things.” 4 Also, “And He Himself, the Most Ancient of Ancient Ones, is called Arikh Anafin , Vast Face, and He who is more external is called Ze’ir Anafin , or Small Face, in opposition to the Ancient Eternal Holy One, the Holy of Holy Ones.” 5 And, “The Ancient One is hidden and concealed. Small Face is manifested and NOT manifested. The manifested is written in the letters. The NOT on its level is hidden in the letters, And He ( avh , Hu ), the NOT ( al ), is settled in Ya h hy , The upper ones and the lower ones.” 6 On the Tree, Vast Face is associated with the uppermost center at the crown of the head called Sefirah Crown/Above. Sefirah Crown/Above is a condition of Pure Being, a supernal station of superconsciousness that witnesses the singular modification “I AM” or simply “I.” Even this singular modification disappears in the negatively existent roots of the Tree.

The unmanifest Pure Being of Vast Face in Sefirah Crown/Above is reflected in the abysmal mirror of Sefirah Foundation/Below as veils of illusion appearing as planes of existence (see Figure 3.5 on page 89). These planes are unmanifest in the most sublime World of Atziluth (Emanation). The attributes of the Ayn are reflected in this mirror as the immense I-ness of Small Face as the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer of the universe. The energy of consciousness of Small Face manifests the planes of existence in the lower three Worlds of B’riyah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation), and Asiyah (Making, Activity). Like Sefiroth Crown/Above and Foundation/Below, the two central Sefiroth Knowledge/First and Beauty/Last emanate as a pair, and represent two opposite stations in the consciousness of this Small Face I- ness. When the immense I-ness is centered in Sefirah Knowledge/ First, It has the singular awareness that “I am Nothing;” when centered in Sefirah Beauty/Last that “I am All.” The composition of the Tree and the four worlds will be discussed in further detail in subsequent sections of this chapter. \u001d \t\u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, When referring to the active aspect of the NOT ( al ), the Zohar speaks of “Small Face” ( ]pna ryiz Ze’ir Anafin, also ,ypa ryiz Ze’ir Afim ), represented by the letter Alef a . Small Face is the power of the Ayn ( ]ya ) to superimpose billions of illusory universes (and their apparent sustenance and dissolution over time) upon the Vast Face of the Deep. The generation of universes is brought about by the balanced tension between Vast and Small Face, or between the Ayin i and the manifest Alef a of Unity. In the Sifra Detzniyutha , this tension in the Tree is called “weight” and the “balanci ng in weight.” The relationship between Vast and Small Face is depicted in the Tree of Life. (Figure 3.1) Some of the most important Names of Small Face are YHVH hvhy , El la (pronounced “ale,” opposite of Lo al ), and Adonai ynda (Lord, Master).

In Sanskrit, the Alef a of Unity is called the Omkara . The Alef a of Unity/ Omkara has unmanifest (Vast Face) and manifest (Small Face) aspects. As it is written: “By the First It created Elohim Eth ( ta i.e. the twenty-two Hebrew letters in the Upper Worlds) the Heavens and VuhEth ( tav i.e. the twenty- two letters in the Lower Worlds) the Earth.” ( Torah B’reshith 1:1)"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 +\u0018 In its unmanifest, inactive aspect in the roots of the Tree, the Alef a of Unity/ Omkara is the undifferentiated source from which emanate the supernal Hebrew/Sanskrit letters in the uppermost center of the Tree of Life (Sefirah Crown/Above). At this point, the unmanifest letters stand alone and have not combined into Names. The letters vibrationally differentiate when the Alef a of Unity becomes manifest in the throat Sefirah Knowledge/First. Each letter bears a characteristic root vibration or seed sound (Sans. bija ). The Alef a of Unity/ Omkara is therefore called the “Seed of Seeds” ( Bija of Bijas ). Vocalization of the seed sounds is enabled by the vowels in the throat Sefirah Knowledge/First. The vowels also empower the undifferentiated Names in the supernal Sefirah Wisdom/East to become manifest with a characteristic vibrational signature in the World of Creation (see Figure 3.5 on page 89). The Sinatic Alef is written by scribing the vertical line first (Central Column), from the top point (Sefirah Crown/Above) downwards (see Figure 3.2). Then the horizontal line is scribed from right to left (Column of the Right). Finally, the diagonal line is drawn from the left end-point of the horizontal line upward to the right across the vertical stroke (Column of the Left). The Columns of the Left and Right are opposite reflections in the clear mirror of the Central Column. In the Etz HaChayyim ( Tree o f Li f e ), the vertical stroke is called the Line of Light ( bk , Kav ). The Alif in Arabic uses only this vertical stroke, reflected in the principal Working Tree in the Sufi tradition that only uses the Central Column. The Cross is the Christian Alef + , with the diagonal stroke of the Colu mn of the Left removed. \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0018#\u0017 Evolution of the Alef of Unity The second line of the first verse of the Sifra Detzniyutha ( Book of THAT Which is Concealed ) says, “Until NOT ( al ) existed as weight, NOT ( al ) existed as seeing Face-to-Face.” This is the condition where Small Face is turned toward Vast"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"+3 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Face and therefore is not active in manifesting a universe. 8 We find this condition further described: “And when Ze’ir Anafin looks back upon Him ( Arikh Anafin ), all the inferiors are restored in order, and His Countenance is extended and made more vast at that time. But not for all time is it vast like unto the countenance of the More Ancient One.” 9 The “weight” referred to in the first verse of the Sifra Detzniyutha is the single combination of all the Sefiroth on the Tree. Weights are the individual Sefiroth. The Primordial Kings allude to the unmanifest “Alef Wo rlds” or witness states of Vast Face in Sefirah Crown/Above. The “Crowns of the Primordial Kings” are the Sefiroth in the supernal World of Atziluth (Emanation), and the “Garments of Splendor” are the manifest Sefiroth in the successive three worlds. In the To r a h , “Earth” ( / ra , Aretz ) is a synonym for the Sefirah Malkuth/Kingdom. Hence, the phrase “And the Earth was nullified” infers that matter was absorbed and disappeared. The Sifra Detzniyutha , and in smaller measure the Idra Rabba Qadusha ( Greater Holy Assembly ) and Idra Zuta Qadusha ( Lesser Holy Assembly ), also contain some wonderful verses pertaining to the allusions of the “beards” of the two Faces. The hairs of the beards are the Atziluthic letters evoluting into Divine Names in the World of Creation. The beards each have nine formations or strands manifest in Small Face, with four more inside the Skull of Vast Face as the Hidden Brain.

In the Qabalah, for instance, we find many references to the white-haired ancient father and the raven-haired youthful king. We also find the ancient mother and the maiden Shekhinah ( hnyks ). In virtually all traditions, we can also find many impersonal names and references to Vast Face that are neither masculine nor feminine. However, Small Face, as the active principle, is always named and referred to personally as masculine and feminine. It is cogent to note that the To r a h commands us to “Honor thy father and thy mother.” While this is commonly understood to refer to one’s earthly parents, its higher meaning enjoins us to honor our Divine Father and Mother. The great and beloved nineteenth century Bengali saint Sri Ramakrishna Paramaha msa offered several useful analogies to the relation between Vast and Small Face (static and active aspects of the Divine). These included the relation between milk and its whiteness, a gem and its sparkle, a flame and its power to burn, and the Sun and its rays. 14 An old Vedic analogy compares God to a spider that spins a web from and retrieves it back into its own body. An analogy in Qabalah cites the relationship between the letters of the alphabet and the vowels: without the vowels (active aspect), the letters (inactive aspect) cannot be pronounced. In the Tantra, it is said that “without the vowels, Shiva ’s bones can’t dance.” Another analogy that illustrates the nature and relation of the two Faces is presented in the parable of the rope and the snake: “A man was walking down a road in the country at dusk. Just as he turned a corner, he encountered what appeared to be a large snake. His whole body gripped with fear, and without thought, he jumped back to avoid getting bitten. As he looked at the snake, he noticed that it wasn’t moving. He picked up a rock and threw it at the snake, and still the snake didn’t move. He thought, ‘Perhaps the snake is dead.’ This thought diminished his fear, and he inched closer to the snake to get a better look. As he neared the snake, he was amazed and relieved to find out that it wasn’t in fact a snake at all: it was a rope that he mistook for a snake.”"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"++ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% In this story, there had to be a rope in the first place for the man to have mistaken it for a snake. The “snakiness” was a superimposition upon the rope that only existed in the man’s mind. Such is the nature of the Creation, which is a collective illusion. The “snakiness” of Small Face is an illusion superimposed upon the reality of the “rope” of Vast Face. This illusion of a “difference within Itself” is a play of the Divine arising from an unfathomable whim. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004*\u001d\u0006*\u0016 \u0011\u0006 -,, \u0011 \u001e. \u0011\u0004 *., * '\u0006-\u001e0 \u0016\u0006*\u001e' Virtually all books on the subject of the Qabalah feature one or more forms of the map of consciousness known as the “Tree of Life.” The Tree of Life objectively represents the physio- spiritual entirety of both the individual soul, or Microcosm “created in the image of Elohim ,” and the Divine Soul, or Macrocosm as the “Body of Celestial Man ( Adam Kadmon , ]vmdk ,da ).” Thus, the Hebrew word adam ( mda , lit. man), like the word purusha in Sanskrit, denotes both the individual person and the Supreme Persona of the Divine Self. “And upon the likeness of the throne was the appearance of Adam upon it from above.” 15 As touched upon earlier, the Tree of Life is the qabalistic equivalent of the Tantric Chakras (see Figure 1.3 on page 48) and Sufi Latifas. 16 The Sefiroth of the Tree of Life, the Chakras, and the Latifas represent the same succession of centers or stations of consciousness that correspond to various nerve plexi along the spinal column and cerebrum. The Chakric and Sufi Trees have only one format, with all of their centers in a single vertical row. In contrast, there is a considerable variety of Trees of Life in the Qabalah. Some are flat and linear with one, two, or three vertical columns; some are flat and circular; and yet others are three- dimensional. Almost all books on the Qabalah contain only diagrams of flat Trees. Most of those flat Trees have a straight vertical trunk called the “Central Column,” flanked by two parallel side branches called the “Side Columns,” or the “Column of the Right” and the “Column of the Left.”"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 +5 A pattern of ten circles connected by lines is superimposed upon the three columns (see Figure 3.5).

The Zoharic name of each Sefirah will be given first, followed by the one from the Sefer Yetzirah . The Yetzirathic names are each preceded by the qualifying phrase “Depth of” ( Omehq ), but for the sake of brevity this designation will usually be dropped when referring to them. The two names will be separated by a forward slash e.g. Sefirah Crown/Above, Sefirah Wisdom/East, and so forth. Also, for the sake of brevity, the Zoharic Sefirah Knowledge (of the Ayn) will be referred to simply as Sefirah Knowledge. The Sefiroth are said to be emanations from the unmanifest, undifferentiated Divi ne Source. They form a set of four self-consistent worlds or pl anes of existence within which creatures can exist due to the relative orderliness and smoothness of change. The Sefer Yetzirah tells us that the Sefiroth emanate as pairs of opposites, such as East and West, Crown and Foundation, and Water and Fire. 17 The Sefiroth are linked among one another by “gates.” Each of the interconnecting gates is associated with a specific Hebrew letter. The Sefer Yetzirah is the primary source for the teachings regarding the nature of the letters and their distribution among the Sefiroth on the Tree. The gates connecting the Sefiroth are doors that allow our consciousness to travel from one plane of existence to another. For example, all living beings pass through two gates connecting three Sefiroth every day and night. The physical plane, which is the waking state of dualistic consciousness in most human beings, is represented by the Sefirah at the very bottom of the Tree called “Kingdom” (there is no equivalent in the Sefer Yetzirah ). When we go to sleep at night, we first move through the Gate of the letter Beyt b that links Sefirah Kingdom to Sefirah Foundation/Below, and into the Geviyah (astral shell) in the World of Formation. All people do this every night, and the vast majority experience it as an unconscious state of REM sleep. However, if the gate is crossed while maintaining awarenness, it will be experienced as a conscious dream state. Sefirah Foundation/Below is the point of departure from which we may enter the psychic states by passing through one of the gates into the side columns, or enter even higher levels of consciousness by moving further up the Central Column into Sefirah Beauty/Last."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 5\u0015 When we pass through the next gate up the Central Column of the Tree, called the Gate of the Gimel g , we move into the Sefirah Beauty/Last. Almost all people experience Sefirah Beauty/Last as deep sleep, and pass through the two gates and among the three lower centers unconsciously. Some individuals are able to transit to and from these thr ee lower centers consciously, and there are those who can dual process information from the waking and astral states simultaneously as a matter of course. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0016 \u001e\t\u001f\u001e\u001d*\u0006*\u001e' \u0011 \u001e. \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\u0006 -,, \u0011 \u001e. \u0011\u0004 *., The three columns of the Tree and their respective Sefiroth are said to emanate from or be anchored in the substratum of the unmanifest, undifferentiated negatively existent roots. The Central Column emanates from the negatively existent roots through a single point in the uppermost Sefirah, called “Crown” in the Zohar and “Above” in the Sefer Yetzirah . In the initial event at the genesis of the universe, the unmanifest Light of the Endless enters the Tzimtzum (circular Contraction) through that point in the supernal World of Atziluth (Emanati on), triggering a quantum fluctuation that genera tes the Big Bang and subsequent inflation of the universe. It th en descends through the successive three worlds, thereby manifesting the complete Tree. The Central Column is called the “Line of Light” ( Kav ) in the Lurianic doctrine presented in the Etz Ha Chayyim . With the expansion of the Tree, the universe is created by the Celestial Head of Messiah called “The First,” and sustained in the Tree as a balanced tension between Vast and Small Face. 18 The extension of the Central Column is precipitated and sustained by the tension between the two Sefiroth Crown/Above and Foundation/Below, which emanate as a pair of opposites. The Central Column is said to be a “clear mirror.” As the Central Column extends, the Column of the Right and the Column of the Left manifest as opposite reflections in the clear mirror of the Central Column. The remaining Sefiroth emanate as pairs of opposites in the two side columns, and the four qabalistic worlds manifest as self-consistent planes of existence.

When the spiritual energy (called Shekinah in Hebrew and Kundalini or Chitshakti in Sanskrit) awakens, it ascends the Tree of Life in various ways, expanding and moving the consciousness through successive planes of existence. Each different path up the Tree is known as a “Working Tree.” The entire spectrum of Trees of Life is also known collectively as “Angelic or Enochian Tree Language.” Angelic Tree Language consists of various types of “Working Trees” and “Trees of Perfection” (Figure 3.6). Mystics seeking union with the Divine, saints, wizards, and white and black magicians ascend the Tree through different Sefirothic patterns. A Working Tree, infused with the power of a suitable Name of God, mantra, or other invocati on, automatically directs the changes in consciousness of the traveler along its characteristic pattern of gates. Different forms of the Tree, called “Trees of Perfection,” allude to enlightened yogis, transcendent devotees, saints and Messiah. In this book, all the various types of Working Trees and Trees of Perfection will be presented. \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0018#4 Fallen and Perfect Trees on the Human Body The Tree provides the finite intellect with a frame of reference for all possible experiences. Each Sefirah is itself a complete Tree present in all planes of existence. The entire Tree, as well as each individual Sefirah , is therefore an open-ended ladder from the waking state all the way into the Light of the Endless (Ayn Sof Or ,"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 5\u0018 rva [vc ]ya ). A great secret of the gates is that they are stationed in the Light of the Endless. Hence, by closing off both ends of any gate, consciousness automatically expands into the Light of the Endless. This is why the experience in the gates can be more unsettling than in the relatively stable and orderly Sefiroth. Another significant component of the Tree of Life is called the “Inner Court.” The Inner Court of the Tree, also known as the “Throne of Glory of El Shadai ,” generally refers to a grouping of four Sefiroth in the center of the Tree of Perfection. The Inner Court is most clearly seen in the three-dimensional, double pyramid Trees of the Sefer Yetzirah and the Merkabah literature. In the Sefer Yetzirah , the four Sefiroth of the Inner Court are called Spirit of Living Elohim , Air, Water, and Fire; and alternately, Depth of First, or simply First, (Depth of) Last, (Depth of) Good, and (Depth of) Evil. In the Zohar , they are the Sefiroth Knowledge, Mercy, Power, and Beauty. Each set of these four Sefiroth corresponds respectively with the three Mother Letters Alef a , Mem m , and Shin s , and the letter Tav t of the Holy Temple. In the flat forms of the Tree, the Sefirah Mercy/Water moves into the Column of the Right and Sefirah Power/Fire moves into the Column of the Left (see Figure 3.5 on page 89). The four Sefiroth of the Inner Court are also shown as corresponding to the four ‘Celestial Heads’ of Messiah of the Lord hvhy . These four Heads are functionally instrumental in creating, maintaining, and dissolving the manifest Small Face universe. In the Sifra Detzniyutha , the emanation and manifestation of the Sefiroth through the action of the Head of Messiah called “The First” ( Reshith ) is described as Small Face turning outward from Vast Face. On the contrary, when the Small Face Universe is dissolved by the action of the Head of Messiah called “The Last” ( Acharit ), the side columns collapse and the Sefiroth return to their unmanifest condition in the roots of the Tree. 19 With the dissolution of the Small Face universe, the two “Faces” are said to return to the condition of “seeing Face-to- Face.” The four Heads of Messiah and the nature of the messianic advent of the Lord hvhy will be discussed more fully in a later section."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"53 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% In addition to the four Sefiroth of the Inner Court, the Tree has six “Directional Sefiroth.” In the Sefer Yetzirah , the six directional Sefiroth are aptly named “Above, Below, East, West, North and South.” In the Zohar , they are respectively called “Crown, Foundation, Wisdom, Glory, Understanding, and Victory.” In the Merkabah litera ture, four of the Directional Sefiroth are correlated with Chayot ( tvyx , Living Beings, sing. hyx , Chayah ), and are also referred to as the “Legs of the Throne.” “And Elohim said the waters will swarm with the movement of C hayah .” 20 “And the Chayot ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.” 21 “And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four Chayot .” 22 The nature of the Directional Sefiroth is most easily understood in the three-dimensional Trees, since humans live and move in a three dimensional space. On the flat Trees, their function with regard to directi onality is less apparent, since such Trees emphasize the three-column structure, and two of the Inner Court Sefiroth are pulled into the side columns. In a way, it could be said that the twenty-two letters are the most salient aspects of the Qabalah. The alphabet is etched deeply in the minds of most Jews from the time they are children. But while most Jews know the Hebrew letters, relatively few are aware of their function and nature within the context of the Qabalah. As mentioned earlier, the most ancient and prolific source regarding the mystical nature of the individual Hebrew letters is the Sefer Yetzirah . In the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ), the letters are seen most prominently as the formulaic components of Divine Names and within the context of the Angelic Tree Language, but no further elaboration is given about them. In the Sefer Yetzirah , on the other hand, the individual letters are introduced in their role as the infrastructure connecting the ten Sefiroth. They are identified according to type i.e. Mother, Double, Simple, how they correlate to various aspects of the human body and to nature, and how they relate to one anothe r. Most contemporary books on the Jewish Kabbalah and Practical Qabalah assign the letters to the gates differently than the Sefer Yetzirah , and often in accordance"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 50 with the teachings of Luria recorded posthumously by Vital. Such discrepancies do not necessarily imply a dichotomy of opposing views, as there is flexibility for setting up the gates on the Tree in different ways. However, some su ch patterns can be problematic, and it is generally recommended to work with the assignations from the Sefer Yetzirah . The discussion of the letter-gates will continue in Chapter Five when the Trees from the Sefer Yetzirah are highlighted. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011. \u001e - \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004*\u001d\u0006*\u0016 \u0011\" \u001e-\u00040\u001d The Qabalah describes four “worlds.” These four worlds are respectively called Atziluth ( tvlyoa , World of Emanation), B’riyah ( hayrb , World of Creation), Yetzirah ( hryoy , World of Formation), and Asiyah ( hysi , World of Activity or Making). The World of Atziluth is also called the “Supernal World.” It is rooted in the Sefirah Crown/Above and correlates with the letter Yod y in the Name hvhy . In Atziluth, the twenty-two Hebrew letters are yet unmanifest, and are said to “stand alone ablaze the crown of the King Most High.” “The Ancient One is hidden and concealed. Small Face is manifested and NOT manifested. The manifested is written in the letters; The NOT on Its level is hidden in the letters. Twenty-two letters that are concealed, Twenty-two letters that are manifest. A concealed Yod y , a manifest Yod y . The concealed and manifest are balanced in weight.” 23 The World of B’riyah is rooted in the supernal Sefirah Wisdom/East, and correlates with the Upper Heh h in the Name hvhy . In the World of B’riyah, the Word of God (known in the Qabalah as the “Alef of Unity”) becomes manifest, whereby the letters vibrationally differentiate and combine to form Divine Names. In B’riyah, beings are fo rmless and exist as vibrational signatures. “Two stones (letters) build two houses, three stones build six houses, four stones build twenty-four houses, five stones build one hundred and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"54 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% twenty-five houses, six stones build seven hundred and twenty houses, seven stones build five thousand and forty houses.

It is rooted in the supe rnal Sefirah Understanding/North and correlates with the letter Vav v in the Name hvhy . In Yetzirah, the Names of B’riyah interact and manifest the forms of the divine archetypes, which ar e latent and undifferentiated in Sefirah Understanding/North. Beings in Yetzirah have both Name and Form. Finally, in the World of Asiyah, there is the apparent solidification of the Yezirathic forms in physical matter. The World of Asiyah is rooted in the Sefirah Knowledge/First in the Upper Worlds and is represented on the Tree by the Sefirah Kingdom. The Sefirah Kingdom is associated with the Shekhinah and the Lower Heh h in the Name hvhy . The four worlds are represented as a continuum by the Tree of Life. They are successively connected to one another by the letter-gates, which allow consciousness to move to and from them. Many people find it difficult to grasp the idea of the four worlds contained in the Tree. The difficulty often stems from the fact that the four worlds can be assigned to groupings of the Sefiroth on the Tree in its flat, vertical form. At the same time, each Sefirah contains a complete Tree that extends through the four worlds. The relationship between the Tree and the four Worlds is displayed in Figures 3.7 and 3.8. Each figure contains two different forms of the Tree. The diagrams in which the throat Sefirah Knowledge/First is visibl e, and there is no anal Sefirah Kingdom, are Trees of Perfection. The Trees in which the Sefirah Kingdom is visible and the throat Sefirah invisible are Working or Fallen Trees. The difference between Perfect and Working Trees will be discussed in detail in the section “The Tree of Life and the ‘Fall of Adam’ ” on page 99."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 5\u0016 In Figure 3.7, the qabalistic worlds are associated with successive sets of Sefiroth down the Tree.

The physical shell in the World of Asiyah, infused with vital energy ( xvr ruach ; in Chinese, qi ; in Sanskrit, prana ), is called the Nefesh ( spn ), and is represented by the Lower Heh h . The astral shell, called the Geviyah ( hyvg ), is the embodiment of consciousness in the World of Yetzirah (Formation), and is represented by the Vav v . 26 The Upper Heh h is associated with the bliss-filled Ruach Ha Qodesh ( sdqh xvr , Holy Spirit) in the World of B’riyah (Creation). The Yod y corresponds to the witness consciousness of the Neshamah ( hmsn , Divine Soul, equates to Hindu Atman ) in the supernal World of Atziluth (Emanation). The “back of the Neshamah, ” or consciousness in the roots of the Tree, is called the Neshamah Ha Neshamah ( hmsnh hmsn Soul of the Soul) and Ye c h i d a h ( hdyxy , Singularity). The qlifoth have “holes” in them and revolve around one another like the spheres in a Chinese puzzle ball. The holes can randomly line up and give a perceptive flash of the Light of the Neshamah . As the shells continue to move, the line-up of the holes is disrupted and the flash ends. Most humans bury such flashes as traumatic experiences. Purification of the shells through the repetition of a root mantra over time gives the ability to accept such flashes as a desirable experience, making it possible to sustain the experiences much longer. This is the most significant advantage of “taking the Name” (i.e. repetition of root mantra) over random flash techniques. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0006 -,, \u0011 \u001e. \u0011\u0004 *., \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u00116. \u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011 \u001e. \u0011\u0002 0\u0002\t 7 The Tree of Life is a universal map for the evolution of both Divine and individual consciousness in the planes of existence.

One of the mysteries delineated in Tree of Life is the “Fall of Adam.” This Fall is portrayed in the difference between “Working” and “Perfect Trees” (see Figure 3.6 on page 92). Working Trees are so-named because they represent different ways of ascending the Tree. The primary source for all the different types of Working Trees is the Sefer"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"\u0015\b\b ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% HaShmoth . Working Trees are also known as “Fallen Trees.” In the Fallen Trees, the Sefirah Knowledge/First has become invisible and “fallen” into position as the anally centered Sefirah Kingdom dangling at the bottom of the Tree. There is no equivalent for the Sefirah Kingdom in the Sefer Yetzirah , since it only has Perfect Trees in which the throat Sefirah is visible and there is no Sefirah at the anal center. At the macrocosmic level, the Fall of Adam is seen as an apparent differentiation in the states of matter in the Tree of Asiyah. For example, matter can exist in a collapsed condition at the core of black holes as the Sefirah Knowledge/First. Or, it can exist in an expanded manner as mostly hydrogen atoms in Sefirah Kingdom. It is critical to keep in mind that Sefirah Kingdom and Sefirah Knowledge/First are one, not two. It is like looking at one object from two sides. At the microcosmic level in the Perfect Tree, the universe is perceived by human consciousness in Sefirah Knowledge /First as a perfect spiritual unity in the mind of God (i.e. Vast Face). In the Fallen Tree, human consciousness is dualistic in Sefirah Kingdom, perceiving the material universe as differentiated from the spiritual. The Fall is an illusion sustained in individual consciousness by the Lord of the Universe via His/Her power of obscuration, sustained through five limitations: tem poral limits, spatial limits, attachment to particular th ings, limited knowledge, and limited agency. The predominant Hebrew Name for the active aspect of the Ayn as the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer of the Creation is the four letter formula h ’ v ’ h ’ y (vocalized by some as “ Yahweh ,” and more commonly as “ Jehovah ”). 27 The Fall of Sefirah Knowledge/First into Kingdom is also reflected in the duplication of the letter Heh h in hvhy . The Upper Heh h is the latent or unmanifest condition of all Mayic (illusory) possibilities in the form of an infinite number of waves of ideas, and the Lower Heh h is their apparent finite manifestation in matter. Most books on Qabalah show only what is known as the “Composite Tree of Life” (see Figure 3.9). The Composite Tree is obtained by superimposing all the Working Tree paths.

In many contemporary books on Qabalah, the Composite Tree is shown with gates connecting the Sefirah Kingdom to Sefirah Victory/South and to Sefirah Glory/West. This is not correct . When Sefirah Knowledge/First “falls” and becomes Sefirah Kingdom, it takes the Gate of the Beyt b with it, which thereby connects Kingdom only to the Sefirah Foundation/ Below. No other gates connect to Kingdom in the Fallen Tree. The reader might also take not e that the Composite Tree shows gates connecting Sefirah Power/Fire with Sefirah Wisdom/East (Gate of Samael), and Sefirah Mercy/Water with Sefirah Understanding/North (a Gate on the Way of the Saint).

It is with this Name that most mystical qabalistic meditation and magical rituals are performed. The four letters Yod y Heh h Va v v Heh h correspond respectively to the four qabalistic Worlds of Atziluth (World of Emanation), B’riyah (World of Creation), Yetzirah (World of Formation), and Asiyah (Activity or Making). The relationship between Vast and Small Face is perfectly displayed in the Name hvhy . The Name hvhy portrays the active (sexual) tantric union between masculine (yang) and femin ine (yin) aspects of Vast and Small Face in the Upper and Lower Worlds. The Yod y and Upper Heh h are the respective masculine and feminine (or yang and yin) aspects in the Upper Worlds. The Yod y , which emanates in Sefirah Crown/Above, is essentially a witness state the size of the whole universe. The World of Atziluth is thereby rooted in Sefirah Crown/Above. The Upper Heh h , which emanates in Sefirah Wisdom/East, is the latent condition of all Mayic (illusory) possibilities. The World of B’riyah is rooted in the supernal Sefirah Wisdom/East. In Chapter Two of the Sifra Detzniyutha , the Heh h is equated with the nostrils of Vast Face, through which the cosmic breath “rushes forth.” \u0005 \u00038:\u0006 \u0010\u0018#\u0015 Gate Names on the Composite Tree \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0002\u0007\u0004 \u0015\u0013\f\r\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010 hvhy \u0010\u0006\u001e\u001a\t\r\u001c61\u0010\u0001\r\u001c\f\u000e\u001e\u0010\u0001\u001a\u001e6\u001b\u001c \u0017 \u0013\f\r\u0010\u001a(\u0010\f\t\r\u0010\u0006B!\r\u001e\u001e\r\u001c\f\u0010\"\r\u000e<\u001c\f\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010\u0006<\r\u000e\u001e\u001d\f \u001cA\u0010\u0003!\f \u001a\u001c \u0018 \u0013\f\r\u0010\u001a(\u0010\f\t\r\u0010F\u001c!\u001e\r\u001c\u0010\"\r\u000e<\u001c\f\u001d 3 \u0013\f\r\u0010\u001a(\u0010%\r\u001d\u001d \t 0 \u0013\f\r\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010\f\t\r\u0010\u00076\u001e\r\u000e\u00107\u0007\u001a&\u001e\u0010\u0013\f\r\u001d;1\u0010\u0007 A\t\f\u0010\u0001\u001a\u001e6\u001b\u001c 4 \u0013\f\r\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010E\r\u001d\f\u000e6!\f \u001a\u001c1\u0010:\r(\f\u0010\u0001\u001a\u001e6\u001b\u001c \u0016 \u0013\f\r\u0010\u001a(\u0010E\u001a\u001a\u001b\u00107\u0019\f\r; + \u0013\f\r\u0010\u001a(\u0010\"\u001b\r\u001e 5 \u0013\f\r\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010\f\t\r\u0010\" \u001c\f \u0015\b \u0013\f\r\u001d\u0010\u001a(\u0010\f\t\r\u0010$ >\u000e)"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u0015\b\u0018 “The breath of the hollow pillar (nose) of the Ancient One unto Small Face.

The Vav v emanates from the feminine Sefirah Understanding/North and is masculine (yang) in the lower planes. The World of Yetzirah is rooted in this supernal Sefirah. The Lower Heh h emanates from Sefirah Knowledge/First and is feminine (yin) in Asiyah (World of Activity or Making) as the Sefirah Kingdom. In Qabalah, the feminine aspect of the Spirit of Small Face in the lower worlds is called Shekhinah ( hnyks lit. abiding, community).

It is through the interaction of the Vav v and the Lower Heh h that messianic appearances are manifested in the Lower Worlds. The action of the Spirit of Messiah in the World of Yetzirah resonates through the Vav v . The Lower Heh h is the presence of the Spirit of the Lord hvhy as the Shekhinah throughout the material Creation, or “Earth” ( /ra , Aretz ). Actually, the Lord hvhy is referred to in the feminine about 10-15 percent of the time in the To r a h , though often mistranslated or ignored. It is important to note that, despite the medieval injunctions of the rabbinate, the ancient Qabalah is not sexist. Th e Mystical Qabalah establishes the unity and equality of the male and female aspects of the Lord hvhy (“Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother”), and offers “equal opportunity” to become “Masters of the Name” and great servants of our Lord. Among books on the subject of the Qabalah, there is some confusion regarding how the letters Yod y , Heh h , and Vav v are respectively ascribed to the supernal Sefiroth. Many authors ascribe only the upper tip of the Yod y to the Sefirah Crown/ Above and the rest of the letter with Sefirah Wisdom/East. The Upper Heh h is thereby associated with Sefirah Understanding/ North and the Vav v with the Sefirah Knowledge/First. This confusion may stem from the fact that most writers are not familiar with the Tree of Pe rfection, and may not clearly comprehend the nature of the relationship between Sefirah Kingdom and Sefirah Knowledge/First. The confusion may also arise from the fact that the Tree spans the four worlds, and at the same time, each Sefirah is a complete Tree. However, the Sefer HaShmoth and the Sifra Detzniyutha in the verses cited above clearly ascribe the Yod y entirely to Sefirah Crown/Above, the Upper Heh h with Sefirah Wisdom/East, and the Vav v with Sefirah Understanding/North. The Lower Heh h and the World of Asiyah are associated with the seven lower Sefiroth beginning with Sefirah Knowledge/First.

The two end points of the Yod y are respectively the supernal Sefiroth Wisdom/East and Understanding/North, the uppermost sources for the two side columns of the Tree. hvhy \u0011 AND THE N ATURE OF M ESSIANIC A PPEARANCE In all mystical traditions, the concept of Messiah and messianic appearances in the Lower Worlds is the pinnacle of all mysteries, unparalleled in its sublimeness, inscrutability, and controversy. Reflecting the apparently conflicting perspectives of dualism, qualified non-dualism, and pure non-dualism discussed in Chapter One, there are three distinct and seemingly incompatible views of the mystery of Messiah. Some unquestioningly embrace the idea that the immutable Divine Essence spontaneously manifests and sports in human form while retaining full power, omniscience, and omnipresence, and yet remaining unfettered by the laws of mazal and the limitations of relativistic illusion. From th is perspective, such singularly exalted beings are said to appear from time to time throughout human history to deliver fresh dispensations of the universal mystical spirituality at the root of all religions. Another perspective regards such extraordinary souls as the rarest Masters i.e. the “Friends” or “ Rasools ” of God who lead demonstrative lives and perfectly reflect the divine attributes. This second view also embraces the idea that the active aspect of the Ancient One manifests, sustains, and dissolves the Small Face universe through the “Heads” of the Celestial Messiah in the Sefiroth of the Inner Court of the Tree. And finally, there are those who reject both the ideas of a corporeal and a Celestial Messiah outright, regarding all Name and Form as illusory and only the negatively existent Ayn as real."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"\u0015\b4 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% The reader should not find it su rprising that the proponents of these three different views of Messiah are prone to argue for the veracity of their perspective over the others. Previously, it was mentioned that the three different approaches to the mystical worldview are not in conflict, but represent gradations of distinction that exist only in human intellect. The three views of Messiah are likewise such gradations of perspective, all of which are relatively valid and reflect different spiritual constitutions. The Lord of All does appear to sport in human forms. And, the dream of the Small Face univers e is projected and withdrawn through the action of the Celes tial Messiah. And, all Name and Form are finite illusory manifestations, or shadows, of infinite undifferentiated Being. Messiahs come as World Teachers when righteousness fades, and the message of the absolute unity of existence and the primacy of unconditional love, discrimination, and renunciation as a means to intimately know God becomes obscured by the conditioned impressions of conventional religions. Such extraordinary beings remind us in a lively way of our innate divinity and of the spiritual awakening that is our birthright. “Whenever there is a decay of righteousness ( dharma ) and an ascendancy of unrighteousness, I manifest Myself; and for the protection of the virtuous, the destruction of the vicious and for the establishment of righteousness, I manifest Myself in age after age.” 30 By appearing in a human form, Messiahs are able to perfectly portray divine qualities through the medium of human life in a way that can be comprehended by the finite consciousness of humans. In this way, it is said that the message of a Messiah is their divine life. Messiahs also perform other important functions. The deterioration of ri ghteousness is often paralleled by deterioration in the gatekeepers, who have the responsibility of echoing the message of the Messiahs and pointing humanity to the “Open Gate.” Sometimes, Messiahs “wind the clocks” i.e. lead the transition from one Age to another, or vanquish powerful demons that threaten the stability of the Small Face universe."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u0015\b\u0016 Some Messiahs appear to be completely or partially veiled from awareness of their true identity until awakened to it by a Perfect Master who has incarnated to do so, or through a supra-conscious experience of the Divine. Master Mosheh was dramatically changed by his experience of the “Burning Bush.” The Qur’an also tells us that Master Mosheh was “guided” by Al Khidr, often referred to as the “Green One” or “The Jew.” The Perfect Master John baptized Master Yeshuvah in the Holy Spirit. The monk Tota Puri struck the Bengali avatar Sri Ramakrishna in the center of his forehead with a sharp rock. It immediately sent him into a nirvikalpa samadhi that lasted for six months and culminated twelve years of intense spiritual practices, after which Ramakrishna commenced his activity as a World Teacher. The mystery of Messiah (Heb. mashiach ) has been an important component of the Hebrew faith since ancient times. Yet, in the mainstream of modern Judaism, “Messiah” is a concept rarely referred to or discussed, except among the Chasidim. Most Jews are skeptical (if not cynical) that the Lord hvhy takes human form. Many religious Jews unequivocally deny such a possibility, even though there are a number of instances in the To r a h where there is a strong inference that the Lord hvhy did so. As an example, the eighteenth chapter of Torah B’reshith begins with: “The Lord hvhy appeared to him [Abraham] by the terebinths of Mamre...[a s one of the] three men standing near him.” 31 Sometimes we find all of these mysterious strangers popularly portrayed as angels. However, later on, after Sarah laughs at hearing she would conceive, we read that one of the three speaks to Abraham: “Then the Lord hvhy said to Abraham, “...is anything too wondrous for the Lord hvhy ? I will return to you at the same season next year, and Sarah shall have a son.” 32 And the Lord hvhy , through the form of this man, also goes on shortly thereafter to describe th e fate of Sodom and Gemorrah.

At the end of the conversation, in which Abraham pleads for mercy for Sodom, it says: “When the Lord hvhy had finished speaking to Abraham, He departed...” 33 The Shemite qabalistic tradition teaches that the Lord hvhy as the Celestial Messiah has a four -fold nature and function. All four aspects are mentioned and a lluded to in numerous ways and places in the Tanakh , the Peshitta , and the Qur’an . In the Qabalah, the four aspects of Ce lestial Messiah are described as four “Heads.” The four Heads correspond respectively to the four Sefiroth of the Inner Court of the Tree and to the three Mother Letters Alef a , Mem m , and Shin s , and the letter of the Holy Temple, Tav t . The four Heads emanate in pairs and represent the differentiated action of Sma ll Face in manifesting, sustaining, and dissolving the Creation. In the Sefer Yetzirah , the Celestial Heads of Messiah are: 1. “Depth of First” ( tysar qmvi , Omehq Reshith ), corresponding to the letter Alef a . Also simply called “The First,” active in creating. 2. “Depth of Last” ( tyrxa qmvi , Omehq Acharit ), corresponding to the letter Tav t . Also simply called “The Last,” active in dissolving. 3. “Depth of Good” ( bvu qmvi , Omehq Tov ), corresponding to the letter Mem m , active in sustaining, manifested in the Lower Worlds as Master Mosheh. 4. “Depth of Evil” ( ir qmvi , Omehq Ra’a ), corresponding to the letter Shin s , active in sustaining, manifested in the Lower Worlds as Master Yeshuvah. The four letters are also said to be the filters through which the Lord hvhy incarnates. The Name Reshith is contained in the first word of the first line of Torah B’reshith , which could be translated “By the First.” The Hebrew formulae for the names Reshith ( tysar ) and Acharit ( tyrxa ) contain many letters in common. The letter formula of Master Yeshuvah’s name ( hvshy ) clearly displays the filter of the Shin s in the middle of the Name hvhy (see Figure 3.10). The Hebrew formula for the Name Mosheh hsm is Mem m (Water), Shin s (Fire), Heh h"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u0015\b5 ( Shekhinah ). The reverse of Master Mosheh’s Name, Heh Shin Mem ,sh , is HaShem (lit. “The Name,” an epitaph of hvhy ). It is also interesting to note that in the Sinatic Hebr ew alphabet, the letterform of the Shin is contained in the letterform of the Mem. The full implications of the Lord hvhy manifesting in human form as Master Mosheh have faded into esoteric obscurity. The penultimate storytellers of Torah Shmoth have relayed to us: the spectacular story of the liberation of the Hebrews from Egyptian slavery 34 and the High Magic of Pesach ( xcp , Passover), the attempt to make Israel a “nati on of prophets and priests,” the ultimate drama on Sinai, and the meticulous construction of the Tabernacle containing the Ark. Many wonderful teachings about the nature and significance of Messiah in the Hebrew and Jewish traditions have been lost, suppr essed, distorted, or watered down. Hence, Jews generally regard Ma ster Mosheh as a kind of “holy magician,” and have lost almost all awareness of the significance of Master Yeshuvah having come to renew the core mystical teaching of the Jews within the context of Judaism. Considering that many Christians themselves are confused by contradictions, inter-sect differences, and fundamentalist rigidity in Church dogma, it is not surprising that most Jews refute any credibility for Master Yeshuvah as being a messianic appearance of the Lord hvhy . \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0018#\u0015\b Hebrew Name Yeshuvah When Master Yeshuvah came, the Jews were waiting for the messianic advent of the Lord hvhy as Acharit (The Last), who was expected to liberate them from Roman control and give the Jews dominion in Palestine.

Furthermore, Master Yeshuvah threatened to undermine the spiritual authority of the Pharisees and the economic authority of the corrupt Sadducees, at a time when the Temple of Jerusalem was the biggest “bank” in the trade-rich Middle East. In the Gospels of Matthew 11:14 and Mark 9:11-13, Master Yeshuvah specifically identifies his cousin, John the Baptist, as the reincarnation of Eliyahu HaNabi (Elijah the Prophet). In Tanakh , it is said that Eliyahu will again incarnate to announce the final messianic advent of the Lord hvhy . In the Qabalah, Eliyahu is said to be the incarnate form of the letter Tzade o (letter-gate on the Column of the Left on the flat Tree). The Tzade o is “at war with” the letter Zayin z (letter-gate on the Column of the Right). The Zayin z incarnated as Yez ebel, who was subsequently vanquished by Eliyahu; and then as Salome, whose infamous nude dance resulted in the beheading of John the Baptist. So, the mainstream of religious Jews deny Master Yeshuvah as a messianic appearance of the Lord hvhy within the context of Judaism. They greatly revere, but do not generally ascribe messianic stature to Master Mosheh, ignore the massive commonalties with Islam, and wait for Acharit who will bring the Jews to the Great Sabbath. Mainstream religious Christians politely respect Master Mosheh, but certainly have no sense of him as a Messiah. They feel no connection with the Prophet Mohammed and Islam, regard Master Yeshuvah as the exclusive and only incarnation of the Lord hvhy , and are waiting for “The Last” to appear as the “Sec ond Coming of Master Yeshuvah” who will vanquish Satan ( lamc , Samael ) and take (only) twice born Christians to Heaven. Mainstream religious Muslims, who officially don’t believe in the possibility of Messiah (notwithstanding their tradition of the “Hidden Maghdi, ” and the messianic beliefs of some Sufis), 35 have an ambiguous respect for Master Mosheh and the “People of the Book.” They regard Master Yeshuvah (called Isa in the Qur’an ) as an “immaculately conceived” master of the highest rung. They are waiting for “The Last” to take action on the “Day of Judgment” ( Yo m A h - D i n ), when Allah will resurrect the souls of the faithful in Paradise."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0011\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0003\u0001\u00022\u0012\u0013\" \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 \u0015\u0015\u0015 \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0018#\u0015\u0015 Acharit Wielding a Sword Riding a White Horse Many details found in the To r a h , Peshitta ( Gospels ), and Apocrypha regarding the nature, lives, experiences, powers, and teachings of Master Mosheh and Master Yeshuvah find parallels in those of Messiahs in other tradit ions. Messianic appearances are called avatara in Sanskrit. The Hindu tradition contains beautiful and profound descriptions of the lif e dramas and teachings of the ten incarnations of Vishnu , including Rama, Krishna, Narasimha (lit. Man-Lion), and Matsya (the Fish, who is said to have appeared to Noah during the Flood). Hindus also ascribe messianic stature to Chaitanya (sixteenth century CE), Ramakrishna (1836- 1886), Shirdi Sai Baba (d.1918) and Satya Sai Baba (1925- present). They assign such status as well as to incarnations of the Divine Mother i.e. the Goddess, such as Saradamani Devi (1853- 1920), Anandamayi Ma (1896- 1982), Amritanandamayi Ma (1953-present, known widely as “Ammachi”), and others.

Master Yeshuvah was ridiculed by those in authority, and eventually tortured and appare ntly crucified. Master Mohammed was forced to prevail in tribal warfare, and at one point had to escape from Mecca to Medina. Mast er Rama was banished to the forest for fourteen years and forced to battle the demon Ravana to win back his kidnapped wife Sita. Master Zoroaster was poisoned.

The Central Column, balancing the two, remains unaffected by such conflict and those who dwell there are essentially invisible to the beings on either side. Unlike the Central Column, the Columns of the Right and Left have “gatekeepers” who strictly enforce standards that must be met to progress further.

The variety of Working Trees reflects the different paths by which different types of magicians, wizards, saints, devotees, and yogis ascend the Tree of Life. Devotees and yogis generally make exclusive use of the Central Column. Their paths are referred to as “Central Column Working Trees.” Magicians, wizards, and saints, on the other hand, make significant use of the side columns on the Tree. The Working Trees of the magicians make exclusive use of one or other of the two side columns.

The “Way of the Angels of Elohim ” (see Figure 4.1) is also called the “Right-Handed Path,” and those who traverse it are often referred to as “white magicians.” They engage in disciplines, routines of behavi or, and rituals intended to cultivate love of the Lord hvhy , righteousness, and purity in order to pass the inspection of the gatekeepers who guard the Column of the Right on the Tree.

White magicians use the Name hvhy and other power names to invoke powerful angels and to manifest and use creative powers.

However, unlike white magicians, they do not generally desire or seek to wield creative or healing powers.

The Way of the Saint involves an arduous progression up the Tree in which all the Sefiroth of all three Columns are traversed one by one through a specific sequence of letter-gates (see Figure 4.2). In occult literature, this path is often confused with the Way of the Wizard. The wizard moves up the Tree in the identical manner as the saint, but in exactly opposite order and using different letter- gates (see Figure 4.2). The Wizard’s Path begins with ritual purification to gain access to th e Column of the Right through the Gate of the Yod y . The Saint’s Path begins with trials by fire via the Gate of the Samek c to bankrupt the ego and engender complete surrender to the Will of the Divine. The wizard seeks to acquire power out of selfish desire for personal control, and the saint seeks to respond with righteous intent to the dictates of the Di vine Will.

The Sefer Yetzirah presents a number of unique forms of the Tree of Life. The first of the six chapters of the Sefer Yetzirah begins: “By thirty two wonderful paths of wisdom hy , hvhy of Hosts, Elohim of Israel, Living Elohim , and Eternal King, El Shadai , Merciful and Gracious, High and Uplifted, Who inhabits Eternity, Exalted and Holy is His Name, engraved. And He created His universe by three signs: by border and letter and number.” 1 The “thirty-two paths” which comprise the Tree of Life are the ten Sefiroth ( tvrpc , lit. Spheres) and the twenty-two release gates interconnecting the Sefiroth . The gates are the twenty-two Hebrew letters (see Figure 3.5). The first verse above is immediately followed in the second verse with the five root phrases that serve as the “skeleton” upon which the body of the book hangs. One or another of these root phrases lead into most of the verses throughout the rest of the text. “There are Ten Intangible Sefiroth ( hmylb tvrypc rsi , Eser Sefiroth Belimah ) and Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation ( dvcy tvytva ,ytsv ,yrsi , Esrim Ooshtayim Autiot Yesod ): Three Mothers ( tvma sls , Shalosh Imote) and Seven Double Letters ( tvlvpk ibs , Shevah Kuhfoolote ) and Twelve Sim ple Letters ( tvuvsp hrsi , Esrae Puhshootote ).” 2 The verses beginning with “Ten Intangible Sefiroth” generally allude to various forms of the Tree of Life, some of which are unique to this book. We mentioned earlier that the Sefer Yetzirah is the textual source for the six-pointed star, commonly known as the “Star of David.” The Star of David, a two-dimensional symbol composed of two interlocking triangles, is easily the most recognizable symbol of the Jewish religion. This way of viewing the star certainly presents a wealth of interpretative possibilities. The Sefer Yetzirah yields two forms of the six-pointed star as Trees of Perfection.

By way of comparison, it is interesting to note that the six-pointed star is also an ancient and important symbol in the North Indian Tantric tradition, dating back to the second millennium BCE. In the Tantric tradition, it is associated with the Anahata Chakra in the heart center. The Sefer Yetzirah also describes a flat, vertical version of the Tree of Perfection. As with other flat Trees, two of the “Inner Court” Sefiroth (Water/Good and Fire/Evil) are moved into the side columns, with the gates adjusted accordingly (see Figure 3.5 on page 89). The names of the Sefiroth in the Sefer Yetzirah are based on the elements (Spirit of Living Elohim , Air, Water, Fire), or alternately, on the four “Heads of Celestial Messiah” (First, Last, Good, and Evil), and the six directions (Above, Below, East, West, North, South). The six directions are sealed through permutations of the Name vhy . The final Heh h of the Name hvhy is dropped due to the fact that the action is occurring in the astral World of Ye t z i r a h . “There are Ten Intangible Sefiroth whose measure is ten without end: Depth of First and Depth of Last, Depth of Good and Depth of Evil, Depth of Above and Depth of Below, Depth of East and Depth of West, Depth of North and Depth of South.

Some of these two- letter roots are known Hebrew “words” with literal and hidden meanings, and some are unknown. “ Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation : He engraved them, He hewed them out, He combined them, and He set them at opposites, and He formed through them everything that is formed and everything that is destined to be formed.” 5 “ Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation : He set them in a cycle like a kind of wall with two hundred and thirty one gates... And it (the cycle) rotates forward and backward... and thus everything that is formed and everything that is spoken goes out from One Name (i.e. hvhy ).” 6 The third chapter is keyed to the root phrase: “Three Mothers Alef a Mem m Shin s .” The Mother Letters are the gates among the Sefiroth of the “Inner Court” of the Tree (First, Last, Water, Fire). These letters are discussed in relation to the universe— Heaven, Earth, and the space between them, the seasons of the year (hot, cold, temperate), and the body of male and female (head, belly, and the Geviyah ). Verses in both the third and sixth chapters mention “fathers” born from the archetypal elements of the Mother Letters.

The action of the Directional Sefiroth is alluded to as the “Living Beings ( tvyx , Chayot )” mentioned in the To r a h and the Book of Ezekiel . “And Elohim said the waters will swarm with the movement of Chayah .” 8 “And the Chayot run forth and return.” 9 Each Double Letter is has tw o pronunciations e.g. Pey Fey, Kaf Khaf, and two opposite principles e.g. Life/Death, Dominion/Slavery. Through them are said to have formed seven planets, seven days of the week, and seven orifices of the eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. “ Seven Double Letters : Beyt b Gimel g Dalet d Kaf k Pey p Resh r and Ta v t are the foundation.

Therefore He cherished the seventh ones under all the heavens.” 10 The twelve Simple Letters, also called the “borders” and “everlasting arms” of the Tree, are gates that connect the Directional Sefiroth among one another. Chapter Five, Verse 2 gives an exact delineation of how the Simple Letters are assigned to the diagonal borders on the Tree. The reader will note that the way the text assigns the Simple Letters to the respective borders differs significantly from the wa y that Luria places them on the Tree (see Figure 5.9 on page 151), and also from the way they are assigned to the gates in virt ually all books on the Hermetic Qabalah and commentaries on the Taro t. This verse also says that they (i.e. the “arms of the unive rse” a.k.a. the Simple Letters) “become wider for ever and ever.” Briefly referring back to the parallels drawn in Chapter One between the Mystical Qabalah and modern cosmology, one of the continuing debates among astrophysicists regards whether or not the universe is closed i.e. will not expand forever. On the one hand, the model of a closed universe holds that there is sufficient mass in the universe so that the Big Bang expansion will gradually slow down and reverse due to the pull of gravity. In this model, all the mass of the universe involutes back into its unimaginably small and dense original condition until another quantum shift precipitates another explosion. On the other hand, there are those who contend that the supernova data on distant gala xies confirms that there is insufficient mass for the reversal to occur, and that the negative expansion energy of space is causing our universe to expand forever. It is therefore interesting to consider the implication of this verse of the Sefer Yetzirah within the context of this debate. “ Twe lve Simp le Letters : Heh h Va v v Zayin z Chet x Te t u Yo d y Lamed l Nun n Samek c Ayin i Tzade o Qof q .

For the reader’s convenience, all of the correlations given by the Sefer Yetzirah for the Mother, Double, and Simple Letters are given in Tables 4.1 through 4.3. The fifth chapter ends by mentioning three allusions: the “Sunset,” the “Wall,” and the “Battle.” The Sunset (Figure 4.13) includes all the information on the letters in the Sefer Yetzirah . The Wall (Figure 4.12 on page 130) is a tabulation of all possible two- letter permutations. The Battle (Figure 4.14) is a diagram depicting the tension between the dual aspects of the Double Letters, a nd between six pairs of Simple Letters. This tension plays an integral function in the Creation process.

The Chariot is an allusion to the Tree of Life. The specifications regarding the Merkabah version of the Double Pyramid Tree (see Figure 5.1), called “Chariot Shadai ,” are found in verses in the Books of Ezekiel and Isaiah . The highly anthropomorphic image of the Yo s h e r (lit. upright) form of the Name hvhy is “seated upon the Throne of Glory” in the center of the Chariot, with the three Mother letters Alef a , Mem m , and Shin s resting above the Yo s h e r like a crown. Each Directional Sefiroth is associated with a Chayah (lit. Living Being). The four Directional Se firoth East, West, North, and South are called the “Legs of the Throne.” As shown in the diagram below, Hebrew letters, Divine Names e.g. Gadol , Gabor , archangels, three animals and Man, and patriarchs are imputed to the four Legs. The Inner Court is connected to the Legs via Double Hebrew letters, with which are associated Ofanim (high level angels close to the Throne) and Metatron (“operations manager” of the uni verse). The Directional Sefiroth are connected among one another via the Simple Hebrew letters, which are called the “wings of the Chayot .” The two Central Column Directional Sefiroth on the Chariot Shadai Tree are called “Firmament” and “Abyss.” Trees of Life: Oth er Qabalistic Sources, Oth er Mystical Traditions"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"\u0015\u0018+ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u00100#\u0015 Chariot Shadhai ( Ezekiel, Isaiah ) \u0006 -,,\u001d \u0011 \u001e. \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011 )\u001f\" \u0005\u001f \"\u0010\u0010\" \u0005& \")'\u0001\u0006\" \u0011 &< -,\u0002\u0006,- \u0005 \u001e\u0004# \u0002 \u001d\u001d,\t\u0003\u0004# ( As previously mentioned, the main body of the five volumes of the Sefer HaZohar ( Book of Splendor ), or simply the Zohar , is an exegesis on the five books of the To r a h ( The Law ).

It was originally written in Aramaic, though many translations are made from the Greek version. The Revelation of John presents a specialized form of the “Tree of the Treasuries of the House of Elohim .” This Working Path is intended to take true disciples of Master Yeshuvah to the “New Jerusalem” in the crown center via seven series of seven experiences alluded to in the forty-nine images presented in the text (see Figure 5.5). This reflects the fact that the Tree has a total of seven Sefiroth which span the four qabalistic worlds, a nd also that each of those seven Sefirah is itself a complete Tree of seven Sefiroth extending through all four worlds. The forty-nine allusions represent seven repetitions of the seven Sefi roth acting upon one another. To more easily understand this, ima gine that each of the seven Sefiroth has a test tube containing a differently colored liquid. Then, imagine successively pouri ng some of the colored liquid from each one into the six others, resulting in a total of forty-nine different colors. The Revelation Tree has a different set of names for the Sefiroth than the Tree of the Treasuries of Elohim shown in Figure 4.5 on page 120.

They included Trees that are two-dimensional, and Trees that are three-dimensional; Trees that involve one, two, or all three Columns; Trees that are vertical in their orientation, and circular Trees that emanate from a central Sefirah. While a case can be made that the Mystical Qabala h has the greatest diversity of different Tree forms, other trad itions such as the North Indian Tantrikas, Taoists, and the Po lynesian Kahunas also have maps of consciousness that present their respective worldviews. Most such maps in other traditions are not specifically called “Trees of Life.” They may look diagramatically quite different, or not be depicted in a diagram at all. Yet, it is possible to specifically correlate the names and allusions that they assign for the planes of existence and successive centers of consciousness to those in the Hebrew Trees. The Tantric Chakra System and the Taoist map of the subtle centers are both depicted in highly detailed pictorial images. The “Before-” and “After-the-World” Sequences from the eighth wing of the Chinese IChing ( Book of Change ), titled the Shuo Qua , are much more abstract diagrams, representing the Sefiroth as sets of solid and broken lines. The Polynesian Kahunas, whose scriptures take the form of sacred Hulas recorded on boards in Rongo Rongo writing, do not have a diagram for their Tree, but represent the Sefiroth by the different “ Hi’iakas ” of the Goddess Pele . 1 The Hi’iakas are the same as the Dakinis, the female emanations of the Goddess Kali in the North Indian and Tibetan Tantra. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0016 \u0005\u0002$-*\u0016 \u0011\u0006 -,, The absorption and synthesis of many Eastern mystical ideas into a myriad of New Age therapies, holistic psychology, and “tantric sexual ecstasy for the masses” has made the Chakra system the most salient map of consciousness in Western culture.

In the Chakric Tree, the Chakras are described as lotuses with varying numbers of petals, upon which stand specific Sanskrit seed sounds (San. bija ). The “fallen” condition is portrayed in the Chakric Tree by the petals on the lotuses turned downward. When the Chakric Tree is ascended, the petals of each lotus turn upwards as the consciousness of the traveler awakens in it. As previously mentioned in Chapter One, the Tantric texts (called Shastra ) on the Chakras describe the Chitshakti (energy of consciousness), known as the Goddess Kundalini , as a coiled snake asleep at the base of the Chakric Tree. The Shekhinah of the Qabalah is said to be in exile in the Lower Worlds. The Kundalini and the Shekhinah are two distinctly different allusions for the same thing. The snake of the Kundalini is said to awaken and ascend the Chakric Tree, opening the Chakric lotuses on Her way to un ite with Her Husband Shiva in the Ajna Chakra at the forehead. The ascent by the Kundalini is also called the Satchakrabheda , the “Piercing of the Six Centers.” The ascent of the Tree of Life by the Shekhinah is called “ Shabat ” ( tbs , Sabbath). On the Sabbath, Shekhinah ascends the Tree of Life and unites with Her Husband hvhy in the World of Atziluth, thereby transforming the Fallen Tree into the Tree of Perfection. \u0005 \u00038:\u0006 \u00100#\u0015 Sefiroth, Latifa, and Chakras \f\t\u000e\u0002\u0003\u000f\t\u0010 .\u0002$\u0002\u0017\u0002\u0014)\u0004+\u000f\u000b\u0002 )\u001b+\u000f\u0014\f\u0002\u0003\u000f+\u0002\u0005 \r\u0002\u0010\u0003\u000b\u000f\u000e\u0014%\u0002/\u000b\u0002 \u0001\u000e\u001a/\u001c\u0010\u001a(\u0010\u0002\r) -\r\f\r\u000e,\u0007\u001a\t\u001b \u0002@ @ \"\t\u001d\u000e\u000e\u00107\u0015\b\b\b\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; \u0019\u001a\u000e\r\t\r) \u0002\u001a!\t\u001b\t, % >\u000e!\tG8 \u001c\t, \u0005>(\u001a\t\u001c -\t( & \u0003M\u001c\u00107\u0017\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; \u0005\t\u000e\u001a\f 2\u001c< \u001d \u001f\u001e\r\u0010E?\f\t,\u0010 \u0007\r\u001d\t \f\t \u00076\t & C \u001d\t6))\t\u00107\u00154\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; \u0005\t\u001a\u000e! ! \u0005 (\u000e\r\f\t,\u0003!\t\u000e \f \" \u000e & \u0003\u001c\t\f\u001074\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; \"\u001a\u001e\u000e\u0010\u000b\u001e\rB6\u001d \u0012\r\f>!\t,\u0010 E\t\u000e\u001a\t\u001b\u0010G\u0002\u001a), %?\u000e< '\u001e\u001f & %\u001c \u000b6\u000e\u00107\u0015\b\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; :\u001a/\r\u000e\u0010\u0003\u001f)\u001a\u001b\r\u001c =\r\u001d\u001a),\u0005!\t\f \u0012(\u001d & \"<) \u001d\f\u001c\u001074\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d; \u0003\u001c6\u001d %\u001e9\t6\f\t '\u001e\u001f & %6\u001e)\t\u000e\u001073\u0010\u000b\r\f\u001e\u001d;"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"\u001503 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% The Chakras are equated to the mental planes mentioned in the Vedas , as follows: “ Mind in Worldliness ” 1st plane - anus, waking state ( Muladhara Chakra ) 2nd plane - sex organ, dream state ( Svadisthana Chakra , T’an Tien in the Taoist Tree) 3rd plane - solar plexus, conscious dream and psychic states.

The qabalistic Tree becomes a Fallen Tree when the Sefirah Knowledge/First in the throat center ostensibly “falls” and becomes the Sefirah Kingdom in the anal center.

It uses the proce ss of discrimination between the Real and the Illusory to renounce all experiences and changes in consciousness through all planes of existence, until individuated consciousness dissolves and merges in the undifferentiated Ground of Pure Being i.e. Ayn ( ]ya ). Small Face Yoga, the yoga of devotion and selfless service, is personal in nature and regards the multiplicity of Name and Form as a Great Unity in Small Face. It is characterized by unconditional love and surrender to one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal, intimacy, compassion, sense of beauty, ritual, and mental renunciation. By far the most common meditative practices in Small Face Yoga in all mystical traditions involve root mantra, visualizations, and often breathing exercises. “So remember ( dikhr ) the Name of Allah and devote thyself with a complete devotion.” 1 The great sage of Arunachala Sri Ramana Maharshi 2 taught: “The eternal, unbroken, natural state of abiding in the Self is jnana [knowledge of the Ayn ]. To abide in the Self, you must love the Self. Since God is verily the Self, love of the Self is love of God and that is bhakti [devotion to One Small Face].

The Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) designates especially powerful Names that will light the whole Tree. The most common meditative practice of Small Face devotional yoga in all mystical traditions is the repetition of a root mantra combined with an appropriate visualization. In Hebrew, it is called zakhor ; in Arabic, it is called dikhr ; and in Sanskrit, it is called japa and namasmarana . Root mantra are sacred utterances upon which entire religions are built and sustained. A good yogic mantra or string of power names gives the indi vidual consciousness an encoded ladder that will systematically move it through successive levels of the Tree. A well-structured root mantra usually combines a principal Name of Small Face with an appropriate name of Vast Face. It also includes built-in mechanisms to ensure smooth and natural transitions between the plan es of existence and stations of consciousness, and into the roots of the Tree. In the Mystical Qabalah, most such root mantra involve the Name hvhy . “It is very good for a person to depict the letters of the Name hvhy before the eyes of the mind.” 4 Repeating a mantra over time cr eates a sympathetic vibration in the mind. It purifies desires, intensifies unconditional love and surrender, and naturally cultivate s and enhances discrimination, same-sightedness, renunciation, a nd one-pointed concentration. True mantra have an intrinsic power to purify the shells ( qlifoth ). The One Name of Small Face that naturally appeals to each aspirant is called their “Chosen Ideal.” Through years of practice and divine grace, the mind of the meditator literally becomes the mantra that is repeated, and ever ything in the universe is seen as a form of their Chosen Ideal. The intention of repeating a root mantra that includes a Small Face Chosen Ideal is to get the consciousness of Small Face—the male and female active principle of the Ayn ( ]ya ). Small Face is the power of the Ayn to project, preserve, and dissolve a unified Small Face universe. It is also the immense I-ness of the Divine Personality endowed with all possible attributes. When this I-ness is “turned outward” to the Creation, it is stationed in the consciousness that “I am All.” When we awaken to the consciousness of Small Face, we"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0019 \u0011F\u0012E\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u00154\u0015 realize that we (and all beings) have always been Small Face, not a little individual plagued with suffering. Once a meditator unites with the consciousness of Small Face, there are two options. One is to remain fixed in it for the remainder of this Small Face universe. The second option is to renounce it—meaning you renounce the consciousness of creating, sustaining, and dissolving the universe. In renouncing the consciousness of Small Face, expansion into the undifferentiated consciousness of Vast Face is automatic. The immense I-ness is now turned “Face-to-Face” and united with Vast Face in the awareness that “Nothing alone exists.” Here we learn that Small Face has one great secret - that there is no creation, no destruction, no one in bondage, no one seeking liberation, no one liberated . If our mental matrix survives the experience of the negatively existent roots, we would be able to reemerge as an individuated being in the Small Face Creation as a Tree of Perfection. As a Perfect Tree, the Sefirah Kingdom would have returned to its position as the visible Sefirah Knowledge/First, and the whole uni verse is perceived as a Great Unity in Small Face. Actually, the Sefirah Knowledge/First is always there, but in a fallen state we do not see it, and matter and spirit are perceived as separate in Sefirah Kingdom. \u0016 #\u0003,-',\u0006*\u0016\u001d \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\t #\u001d\u0006*\u0016\u0002\u0004 \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0005 \u001d \t\u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, \u0011 \u0002'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\u0005 \t\u0002' \u0011\u0003 -\u0002*' Taking a modern perspective that combines neurology, cybernetics, and Jungian ideas, Smal l Face is a Great Unity in the sense that it is a totality archetype, a quintessential fractal that permeates in its entirety every atom of the manifest universe.

The underlying 0 level of the brain is a bit count of on-off neurons, similar to the 0 level of a computer with on-off diodes. The on-off condition is set by the resistance (in ohms) of each electrochemical s ynapse to the next neuron. There are multiple branch points (on the order of 10) off of each neuron, so 9 of the 10 channels are high resistance (1 megohm) and one is low resistance (.01 megohm). The information flow follows the low resistance channel. Some 10E11 bits of RAM (read and write memory) are stored in the 100 billion cells of the fourth brain (cerebral cortex), linked by 100 trillion synaptic connections. There are also some 10E10 bits RAM and ROM (read only memory) in the first three brains (commonly referred to as the “reptilian brain”): the medulla, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. This is where the automatic ROM is stored, permitting automatic and semi- automatic physical functions. Our brains have a pictorial readout similar to a TV scan. The reason for this is that logic, speech, and words formed recently in our evolution. Access to information was needed immediately in the form of complete pictures e.g. “this is a sabre tooth tiger, compare what you see with the inner brain picture recalled for a sabre tooth tiger, and RUN!” This has to be done quickly in order to survive, so the people who were able to do it survived and those who could not died out. The usual picture unit is stored in a dissipated way throughout the cerebral cortex. The reason for this is that if a part of the brain is injured and its function impaired, most of the information would still be intact and could be re trieved by the root reconstructing pattern with some bits missing. The 10E11 bits in the fourth brain have to be replenished constantly or they become chaotic. The electrochemical neuronic synapses are replenished by writing the same information over them, which generates the illusion of an ongoing, orderly continuity superimposed over an unperceived negatively existent substratum. And who replenishes the bit stream in the fourth brain? Small Face! This is the basis for the qabalistic teaching that Small Face creates, preserves, and dissolves the universe moment by moment by moment. At the microcosmic level, this means all memories of the past and all hopes for the future, all that you know to be you, is replenished moment by moment.

Since all memories and projected futures regarding that person or people would like wise be changed, this could occur without anyone necessari ly knowing that it happened. If this is the case, consider the implications regarding the anticipated messianic action of Acharit ... All totality archetypes are stored in the fourth brain in the “ONE File.” This Unity File is the deep background of brain activity, defined as impressions of past karmic activity and offering standard solutions and standard situations derived from deep memory. A lot of this deep background is contained in genetic coding that is hardwired at the moment of conception. In deep time, all of the brain’s “files” merge into the archetype of the totality i.e. the brain ends up with just the ONE File. The information of a compressed file in a computer is sealed into its storage site with a specified code. In computer parlance, a file of information that is compressed and locked this way is called a “zipped file.” A zipped file is sealed by what is called an executable command. When you activate the executable command, the entire file is opened. In mystical terms, activating the appropriate executable command in the form of a root mantra opens the zipped totality archetype . When we use a specific root mantra to trigger the executable file of a respective Small Face totality archetype, we gradually alter the currents in our synaptic bits by a process of fractal reprogramming. This results in an overall change in the way an i ndividual perceives the Small Face universe. Hence, when you open a totality archetype, it fractalizes and becomes the en tire universe in your individual consciousness. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004*\u001d\u0006*\u0016 \u00116\u0005 \u001e\u0004\u001e0,\u0016$ 7 In the science fiction televi sion series “Star Trek,” the Starship Enterprise has an interesting recreational facility called the “Holodeck” that appears in numerous episodes.

The computer can be directed to modify or end the scenario at any time. A contemporary hologram is a two-dimensional image that is made to look as if it is three-dimensional. It is generated by shining lasers on an object from a number of different directions simultaneously. In the Holodeck, a three-dimensional hologram is made to appear as four-dimen sional i.e. actively changing over time within a consistent set of parameters, with the computer refreshing the bits from moment to moment. Keeping in mind that analogies are only approximations in thought intended to enhance unde rstanding, it is interesting to compare the Holodeck with the qabalistic worldview. The qabalistic worldview describe s the universe as a Small Face totality-dream in the Mind of Vast Face. From that perspective, the space outside the ship would correspond to the negatively existent roots of the Tree (i.e. Ayn ). The walls that form the Holodeck would represent the circular Leviathan of Vast Face surrounding the Tzimtzum . The empty space of the Holodeck would correspond to the vacuum within the Tzimtzum . By the will of Vast Face through the action of Small Face, the Kav (“Line of Light”) enters the Tzimtzum through the point of the Sefirah Crown/Above. The Kav is the clear mirror of the Central Column of the Tree, from which the two side columns are opposite reflections. The grid in the Holodeck would therefore correspond to the pattern of ten Sefiroth that constitute the Tree. The point in the grid with the spatial address <0,0,0> would correspond to Sefirah Crown/Above i.e. the point to which all other points in the grid are referenced to determine their relational addresses. The grid by itself, without a hologram projected upon it, corresponds to the Sefiroth in the World of Emanation. When a human directs the computer to project a hologram upon the grid infrastructure, the ensuing illusion of a three dimensional environment th at can change over time would thus correlate to the Sefiroth extending through the four worlds.

They would correspond to the immense I-ness of Small Face manifesting and experiencing the ma nifold attributes of Its own Divine Personality within the empty dream space of Vast Face. The humans create the physical environment of the Holodeck. They create the computer, which is an extension of the human mind. They choose the thematic content of the holographic narrative, which is an extens ion of the human imagination.

The Name hvhy is called the “ Shem HaMeforesh ” or “Brilliant Name of Fire.” It is often simply referred to as “ HaShem ” (lit. “The Name”), reflecting its central importance. The Name hvhy is conventionally translated in scriptures as “Lord.” Within the context of Hebrew grammar, the “word” hvhy is usually cited as a future tense third person form of the verb root hvh (lit. “to be”). 5 Some regard the word as a composite that combines the past, present, and future tense forms of the verb root. Orthodoxy has proclaimed the pronunciation of the letter- formula hvhy as a Name to be blasphemous. When the Name hvhy is encountered in the To r a h or when chanting prayers, religious Jews will either pause in silence out of respect or substitute another power name, traditionally “ Adonai ” ( ynda lit. my Master). In the Latin Vulgate edition of the Tanakh , Jerome set the precedent of changing the pronunciation of the Yod y to “J” and using the vowels from Adonai to produce the anglicized variation “Jehovah.” Jehovah is th e way that most contemporary non-Jews pronounce the Name hvhy . The Name hvhy is sometimes pronounced “ Yahweh ,” reflecting the tradition that the High Priest in the Temple of Jerusalem made a monosyllabic pronunciation of the Name hvhy on Yom Kippur (Day of At- One-ment). The halachic prohibition specifies to avoid pronouncing the four letters of hvhy as a Name . If one is inclined to follow their prohibition, one can use the Atziluthic version wherein the letters are consider ed to be standing alone, and therefore pronounced individually—“Yod (as in ‘code’),” “Heh (as in ‘day’),” “Vav (as in ‘love’),” “Heh.” The “V’s” in the Vav are pronounced by gently touching the upper bicuspids to the lower lip. The Atziluthic version can be regarded as the most powerful way of pronouncing the Name, because it reflects the condition of the letters in the Sefirah Crown/Above. Among the religions of the world, only Rabbinical Judaism does not pronounce its principal One Name of Small Face.

While we are all familiar with the color of fire, there is no rigid prescription prohibiting an individual from using other colors such as white, red, gold, or even black for the fire letters. One might also prefer to use a different color for the solid circular background. A med itator may visualize the linear form or the Yo s h e r (upright) form of the Name hvhy as dancing letters of fire. We could see th e Name as flaming Ezra Hebrew letters or as flaming Sinatic Hebrew letters. More instructions for meditations that employ the Hebrew root mantra are provided in Chapter Seven. The mantra “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh” is found in numerous places in the To r a h and it is especially recommended for its simplicity and proven effectiveness. The word Ani ( yna ) is now a common word in colloquial spoken Hebrew. It has come to mean “I am,” and is used when referring to oneself in the context of conventional speech. In the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) and in biblical Hebrew, Ani is a power name of Vast Face, and thereby refers to the Divine Self as Pure Existence. When “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh ” is used as a mantra in meditation, the ladder of the four letters of the Name hvhy will move the consciousness of the meditator up the Tree and through the four worlds. Then, the Yod y of hvhy becomes the Yod y of Ani , and the consciousness of the meditator merges with the witness states of Vast Face in the negatively existent roots of the Tree. In the roots of the Tree, the Nun n and Yod y in Ani yna exchange places: Ani has now become Ayn ]ya , the Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of the Thing. The mantra “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh” is versatile in that it can be built upon. Any additional Di vine Name, attribute, or gatekeeper, to which the mind of an aspirant is attracted, can be added to Ani hvhy . Examples are: Ani hvhy Shekhinah Belimah ( hmylb hnyks , Intangible Presence), Ani hvhy Ahavah ( hbha , Love), Ani hvhy Echad ( dxa , Unity), Ani hvhy Avraham ( ,hrba , Master Abraham ), etc. The visualization used can be modified according to what is added to the mantra. The visualizations could be s imple or complex.

The flaming letters of the Name hvhy shimmer in Her heart center, cradled just above Her hands. Brilliant gold light shines forth in all directions from Her body, Her face veiled by the light. The “ Shema ” is the best known and most revered root mantra in the Jewish religion. According to the Zohar , it should be pronounced “ Shem AYN Yisroel Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohenu Yod Heh Vav Heh Echa---- D .” In the To r a h , the letters Ayin i (in “ Shem Ayin ” i ms ) and Dalet d (in “ Echad ” d xa ) are greatly enlarged. Together, they make the secret root Name “ OD ” di (pronounced “ood”), the literal mean ing of which is often said to be “Eternity.” 14 In this root mantra, Shem Ayn ims is the NOT ( al ), the negatively existent Mysterious Unknown, the Hidden of Hidden Ones. Yisroel ( larsy ) is the Supernal Israel, the witness states (Alef Worlds) of Vast Face in Atziluth, and the Name hvhy is the Small Face totality archetype. Elohenu ( vnyhla , our Elohim ) refers to the creative aspect of Small Face in general, and the consciousne ss of our local Star (Sun) in particular. The mantra then returns to the station of Small Face with the repetition of hvhy . It climaxes with EchaD ( dxa ), alluding to the Great Unity of Vast and Small Face. In using the “ Shem Ayn ” for meditation, one can visualize the Name hvhy as dancing letters of fire on a black circular background against a light blue background, as previously described. The root mantra and holiest utterance in the Qur’an is “ La Illaha Il Allah (Hu) .” Maimomades the “Rambam” asserted that this utterance and the “ Shem Ayin ” are essentially the same. 15 “ La ” is the NOT ( al ), “ Illaha ” is Vast Face, “ Il ” is the “glue” between Vast and Small Face, and Allah is the Small Face totality archetype.

Some devotees may have a strong emotional sense of being creatures in the Lord hvhy ’s (or any other Small Face Chosen Ideal) dream- universe. Others may feel like servants of the Lord hvhy the Master; or like the Lord hvhy ’s dear friend, sister, or brother; or like the Lord hvhy ’s wife, or husband, or secret paramour. Devotional Yoga can bring to the forefront the highest fruits of each mood, and spill over into relations with family, friends, teachers, lovers, and strangers. Devotional Yoga seeks a personal, intimate relation with the Divine, infused with devotional passion and fulfilling one’s deepest emotional needs. Some of the clearest and most detailed accounts of the experiences associated with devotional moods are found in the teachings of the Vaishnavas of Bengal in Northern India. The Vaishnavas are ardent devotees of Vishnu’s incarnations, especially Rama, Krishna, and Chaitanya. In Vaishnava teachings, the moods of love are called bhavas , and they are taken to their highest possible spiritual expression in bhava samadhi (lit. devotional mood union). Bhava samadhi is ecstatic absorption in one’s Chosen Ideal in the context of a particular mood. The highest (and rarest) of the bhavas in the Vaishnava teachings is called madhura bhava (lit. Sweet Mood). The madhura bhava is the female mood of the wife/paramour toward God-the-Husband or Secret Beloved, characterized by prema (ecstatic love).

All of the devotional moods are found variously among devotees in all my stical traditions relative to their respective Chosen Ideals. Within the mystical community, there are some aspirants who have awakened to a condition of permanent awareness in the lower astral states of the World of Yetzirah. Most such individuals access this station of consciousness by exiting the waking state; some are able to access it while simultaneously maintaining an operative awareness in the waking state. Either way, there is some danger that attachment to this type of psychic ability can be an entrapment that inhibits further spiritual growth. Among advanced devotees, there are some who awaken to a condition of continuous awareness of their Chosen Small Face Ideal within the context of a particular bhava . As with the lower psychic condition described above, most access this state by exiting their bodies in sleep or trance. A smaller number are seen to maintain a simultaneous awareness in the waking state of Asiyah, and the higher astral states of Yetzirah. Hence, while in the waking state, they may literally see the form of their Chosen Ideal everywhere, in everything. While this station is more desirable than entrapment in the lower psychic states, it can still present a temptation to become addicted to the bliss of this experience, preventing further progress up the Tree. Overcoming such an addiction is no smal l task, and often requires the intervention of an advanced spiritual mentor. Also, frequent intense ananda samadhis can be especially taxing to the nervous system of most humans. 8 \u0002\u001d\u0006 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, \u0011\t ,0*\u0006\u0002\u0006*\u001e' \u0011\u001f -\u0002\u0016\u0006*\u0016,\u001d Some souls, possessed of extr aordinary strength of mind and personal resolve, are not attr acted to meditation on God-with - Name-and Form, but rather are naturally inclined to meditate on Vast Face—God-without -Name-and-Form.

The Vedantic philosophy of advaita (non-duality) regards all Name and Form as illusory, and that Brahman (i.e. the Ayn ) alone exists. Theravada, Hinayana, Tendai, Shingon, Tibetan, Ch’an, and Zen Buddhists perform variations of Vast Face med itation practices taught by Gautama Buddha (regarded as the eighth incarnation of Vishnu by Hindus) and other bodhisattvas (souls who reach enlightenment but remain incarnate to teach and help others awaken). The Buddha practiced jnana yoga (lit. union through direct perception of the Ayn ) and taught ashtanga yoga (lit. eight-limbed yoga of concentration and discrimination) . He sat under the Bodhi Tree, renouncing all experiences on all planes of existence. Seeing that all the koshas (Sanskrit word for shells of embodied existence) were empty, he perceived the u ltimate Truth of Pure Being in nirvana . The Vast Face Taoists follow “quietist practices” that lead them to Stillness in the Tao. The principal mood, or bhava , of Vast Face Yoga is called the “ shanti bhava” (peaceful mood). Vast Face meditation practices include letting the mind rest in its natural state, following the breath, using specialized Vast Face mantra and visualizations, and contemplating paradox e.g. Zen koans . Verbal practices include chanting and contemplating non- dual centered scriptural texts such as the Upanishads of the Hindu Rishis, the Buddhist Prajna Paramita , and the Qabalistic Sifra Detzniyutha . The “Neti, Neti” (“NOT this, NOT this”) process of discriminating Self-inqui ry is used to discern the Real by negating the Unreal. The yogic instructions of Sri Ramana Maharshi, for instance, emphasized a process of inquiry as to the real nature of “Who am I?”: “Who am I? The gross body that is composed of the seven humors ( dhatus ), I am not. The five cognitive senses that apprehend their respective objects i.e. sound, touch, color, taste, odor, I am not. The five cognitive organs i.e. speech, locomotion, touch, excretion, and procreation, with their respective functions, I am not. The five vital airs ( prana , etc.), I am not.

These three appear at the same time and disappear at the same time.” 83 In the Zohar ( Book of Splendor ), Shir HaShirim ( Song of Songs attributed to King Solomon), and elsewhere, the Hebrew Small Face is described as “raven-haired” and “black-bearded.” Vast Face conversely is frequently referred to as the “white- haired, white-bearded, hoary Ancient of Days.” For example: “White are His garments, and His appearance is the likeness of a Face vast and terrible. 18 “...the Head of Days, His Head white and pure as wool. And His raiment indescribable.” 19 In the Mahanirvana Tantra , we find Shiva described as: “He who is white as camphor and the jasmine flower, the Omnipresent One.” 20 In Sir John Woodroffe’s book The Garland of Letters , we find the translated inscription: “She [Small Face as Divine Mother] stands upon the white, corpse-like Shiva . He is white because He is the illuminating, transcendental aspect of Consciousness. He is inert because He is the changeless aspect of the Supreme, and She the apparently changing aspect of the same. In truth, She and He are One and the same, being twin aspects of the One...” 21 In the To r a h , there are a variety of images alluding to the station of Vast Face, such as “Darkness AL ( li lit. upon) the Face of the Deep” 22 We also find a prominent image of the Ancient of Days in the Revelation of John , described as having “fiery eyes and a two-edged sword coming from His mouth” (Figure 6.2).

And What [Vast Face Name] is the Night of Power. The Night of Power is better than a thousand nights; The angels and the Spirit descend in It by the will of their Lord. It is peace for all until the rise of dawn.” The prize of the yoga of knowledge/realization of the Ayn ( ]ya ) is called “ nirvikalpa samadhi ” (lit. union with God- without-qualities) in Sanskrit. Nirvikalpa samadhi is the complete extinction of individua ted consciousness in union with the Mysterious Unknown. Swami Vivekananda, a great disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, wrot e the following “Hymn of Samadhi :” 24 “LO! The Sun is not, nor the comely Moon, all Light extinct; In the great Void of space floats shadow-like the image universe. In the Void of Mind-involute there floats the fleeting universe, Rises and floats, sinks again ceaseless, in the current ‘I.’ Slowly, slowly, the shadow multitude enters the primal womb, And flows ceaseless the only current. ‘I AM, I AM.’ Lo! ‘Tis stopped, even the current flows no more, Void merged into Void - beyond speech and mind; Whose heart understands, he knows the Truth.”"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"\u0015\u00164 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u00104#\u0017 Ancient of Days ( Peshitta ) When the connection is opened via nirvikalpa samadhi to the substratum of the Ayn , everything disappears, including the idea of the substratum.

Hence, most people who have an interest in spiritual awakening are more comfortable at focusing their yogic effort on changing their consciousness, and thereby their universe, into a unitive Small Face totality archetype. Indeed, only a small percentage of spiritual aspirants have the mental constitution and strength to pursue Vast Face consciousness, without first establishing their consciousness in a Small Face totality archetype. Through a process of discrimination, Small Face devotees can get to Vast Face consciousness by renouncing their Small Face Chosen Ideal. In practice, most find that they are unable to renounce that One who has become most dear to their hearts, and who is seen as literally filling their entire universe. \" \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0011\u0005 \u0002\u001f\u001f,'\u001d \u0011\" \u0005,' \u0011# \u001e \u0011\u0002 \u001d\u0016,'0 \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011 \u0006 -,,\u001e. \u0004 *., 1 * '\u0006-\u001e0 \u0016\u0006*\u001e' In ascending the Tree, the individuated consciousness expands through the successive shells, with their respective states and stations, and associated powers. Consciousness in the Geviyah (astral shell) gives control over the dream state and lower psychic states, and can afford such powers as astral projection, clairvoyance, precognition, and “reading” the Earth’s Akashic Record. 25 The Nefesh (physical body in the waking state of the World of Asiyah) shuts out the bulk of information coming from the Geviyah (astral body) because the Nefesh vibrates at a much slower rate. The station of the Ruach Ha Qodesh (Holy Spirit, causal body) in the Sefirah Beauty/Last is normally experienced as deep sleep. The awakening of consciousness in the Ruach Ha Qodesh in the World of B’riyah is usually experienced as an ecstatic and exclusive experience of one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal. In Sanskrit, this experience is called “ ananda samadhi ” (bliss union) and “ salvikalpa samadhi ” (God- with-Qualities union).

Upon passing from the Nefesh (i.e. dying from the physical body), the soul retains its separation and resi des in ecstatic bliss “at the feet of their Beloved” for the durati on of the Small Face universe. Through discrimination and th e renunciation of a dualistic relationship with one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal, the individual consciousness can continue to expand and ascend the Central Column, cross the Abyss of the invisible Sefirah Knowledge/ First, and merge with the Neshamah (Divine Soul) in the Sefirah Crown/Above in the World of Atziluth. This is experienced as a witness state the size of the Small Face universe. In merging with the Neshamah , all separation between the individual and Small Face dissolves. By renouncing the manifestation of Mind- generated universes, “Face turns toward Face” and the universe vanishes like waking up from a dream. Consciousness thereby automatically moves into the Neshamah HaNeshamah (Soul of the Soul), merging with the negatively existent witness states of Vast Face in the roots of the Tree. In the Qabalah, the unmanifest witness states of Vast Face are called “Alef Worlds,” in distinction to the manifest “Beyt Worlds” of Small Face. Hence, we see that Torah B’reshith , the Zohar , the Sefer Yetzirah , and the Qur’an all begin with words whose first letter is Beyt. 26 The station in the roots of the Tree is also called the World of the Yechidah (Singularity). “Therefore, the Secret of Secrets is what men can neither know nor comprehend, nor can they apply their rules of science to It.” 27 “The Head ( Rosh , sar ) of Above, the Holy Ancient One, Mystery of All Mysteries, Head of All Heads, the Head which is NOT ( al ), a Head which is in NOT ( al ), known as NOT ( al ); what is knowable in the Head is NOT ( al ) connected with Wisdom and NOT ( al ) connected with Understanding.” 28 Figure 6.3 displays the generation of the To r a h emanating from the unmanifest singularity of Yechidah .

Meditation gradually desensitizes the mind to accept such flashes as legitima te yogic experiences, thereby making it possible to sustain the experience much longer. In Sri Ramakrishna the Great Master , Swami Saradananda relates the dramatic account of Master Ramakrishna sustaining and surviving six months of unbroken nirvikalpa samadhi after being struck on the forehead with a sharp rock by the sannyasin Tota Puri. 29 The Qur’an alludes to the Vast Face samadhi experience of the Prophet Mohammed as the “N ight of Power,” described as “better than a thousand nights.” The To r a h also makes references to the Vast Face samadhi experiences of Mosheh and Abraham: “And Mosheh knew THAT-NOT; the skin of His Face shone.” 30 “As the sun set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great darkness descended upon him.” 31 “And I will put you in a cleft of the rock while I pass by you.

From Sefirah Foundation/Below, the traveler on the Way of hvhy Elohenu moves through the Gate of the Gimel g into the Ruach HaQodesh (Holy Spirit qlifah ) in Sefirah Beauty/Last. Sefirah Beauty/Last in the World of B’riyah is experienced every night by almost all humans as deep sleep. In consciously passing through the Gate of the Gimel g , the awakening of consciousness in the Ruach HaQodesh in the heart Sefirah Beauty/Last is accompanied by great bliss. The individuated consciousness sustains the constant and exclusive experience of its Chosen Small Face Ideal. This vision often filters down through the astral senses of the Geviyah , so that the Chosen Ideal is seen and heard. Attachment to the bliss experience of Small Face in the Ruach HaQodesh must be renounced if the aspirant is to further ascend the Tree. At that point, the experience may deepen further into the formless World of B’riyah through Sefirah Beauty/Last, or continue to move up the Central Column of the Tree. The Gate of the Gimel g is a mirror upon which collects the residue of karmic impressions (San. samskaras ) of many lifetimes. Hence, in the beginning stages, when we move consciously into Sefirah Foundation/Below, we will often next see the “Watcher on the Threshold” in the mirror of the Gate of the Gimel g . The Watcher is actually the reflection of our own reincarnating Geviyah . People typically run in fear from their Watcher when they encounter it in their dream state. But, the Geviyah is a plastic medium subject to change. Repeating the Name of one ’s Chosen Small Face Ideal (e.g. the Lord hvhy ) cleanses the Geviyah of the seeds of impure desires and spiritual ignorance that have crystallized during past life activity. With the purification of the Geviyah , the Watcher is replaced by the reflection of the Form of one’s Chosen Small Face Ideal, or by a high level gatekeeper, or may even become transparent i.e. clear. When the reflection in the mirror of the Gimel g is transparent i.e. cleared of reflection, the soul becomes invisible to the gatekeepers in the side columns of the Tree, and all paths can be traversed without conflict or obstruction. Such a soul is “Master of the Tree.” A good tip is: if you awaken in the Geviyah in Yetzirah and become aware of the Watcher, instead of running from it, ignore any intrepidation you feel and proceed to go right through it."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"\u0015+\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Many people get side tracked by attachment to psychic powers that can come when they awaken in their Geviyah and elect to move from Sefirah Foundation/Below into either of the side columns. One is well advised to resist that temptation, and eschew such powers when they arise. They will generally go away in a few weeks by simply ignoring them. As mentioned previously, some people develop simultaneous awareness in the waking state and the astral states. This can be quite disconcerting until one becomes comfortable with it. One condition that should be looked for is when a person has uncontrollable “outs” i.e. they have sporadic events in which they shoot out of their physical body, which thereby goes limp. If this starts to happen, it is a flag that one should decrease the intensity or take a hiatus from spiritual practices. This can also happen to women during sexual intercourse through the hyperstimulation of the nerves at th e interior end of the vagina. Such sexually caused or tantric outs can send the woman into a blissful state of ananda samadhi . Repeated samadhis of varying duration generated this way can dangerously strain the nervous system and, despite the lure of prolonged states of ecstasy, should be approached with caution and temperance. \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u00104#\u0018 Way of hvhy Elohenu Superimposed on the Human Body"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0019 \u0011F\u0012E\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0015+\u0018 Other than the Watcher on the Threshold in the Gate of the Gimel g , and the “Shell of Terror” reflected in the Gate of the Alef a . between Sefiroth Beauty/Last and Realization/First (described as the experience of “getting close to the Throne”), the gates of the Central Column are open and colorless. It does not have gatekeepers who must be satisfied to proceed further. The usual early response to the experience of the Shell of Terror is extreme fear due to the ego’s false identification with the mortal physical shell i.e. “I am going to die, I am going to die.” Regarding this, Proverbs says: “The fear of (or reverence for) the Lord hvhy is [at] the beginning of wisdom.” “Beginning” is the Sefirah Knowledge/First, and “wisdom” is the Sefirah Wisdom/East. When the ego is dehypnotized, allowing for its proper identification with Small Face, then fear is replaced by love and the traveler is able to move through the Shell of Terror without fearing the extinction that is to follow. If consciousness becomes temporarily distracted into the Right or Left Columns, it has no recourse on the Tree of hvhy Elohenu but to return to the Central Column, since there are no gates connecting the Sefiroth vertically up the Right and Left Columns. After passing into Sefirah Beauty/Last, the next step in ascending the Central Column in the Way of hvhy Elohenu is to pass through the Gate of the Alef a . The Gate of the Alef a connects Sefirah Beauty/Last with Sefirah Crown/Above, traveling across the Face of the Abyss of the invisible Sefirah Realization/First at the throat center. In Qabalah, the Gate of the Alef a is called the “Sword Bridge.” It is called s irata (“straight path”) in the Fatiha (The Opening) of the Qur’an , and chinuvad (“connecting link”) in the Zend Av es t a of the Zoroastrians.

The Mystical Qabalah, on the other hand, allows each individual to select mantra, visualizations, and practices that appeal to their minds and hearts. This flexibility does have defining limits. This chapter addresses those practices which have proven to work well with a low rate of problems. Regardless of which mantra and practices are selected, the reader is cautioned to start small and progress slowly and steadily. Generally speaking, a Mystical Qa balist may choose to engage in a very simple routine of practices, perhaps only involving the repetition of one particular r oot mantra with its attendant visualization. Or, he/she may choose to engage in a more elaborate routine, performing a combination of primary and auxiliary practices that evolve over time. The only guidelines are: • sincerity of purpose, • purity of intention, • renunciation of the fruits of one’s efforts, • whole-hearted surrender to the reality and will of one’s higher Self, • discrimination between the Real and the Unreal, • vigilant remembrance of the Divine within oneself, and in all beings.

In truth, we do little to bring about the condition of spiritual awakening, and all depends upon the grace of Small Face in whose dream we are creatures. By engaging in the various practices, we try our be st to make our hearts and minds fertile soil for the Divine Gardener to plant and nourish the seeds of our spiritual unfoldment. Once a person becomes a Tree of Perfection and no longer maintains a dualistic mindset, he/she sees that all worldviews are superimpositions upon the Ayn , and that ultimately, “Nothing (Ayn) alone exists .” This does not mean that such a soul cannot as cribe to different mindsets when stationed in different planes of existence. Hence, when in the waking state, such a one may maintain the attitude of a simple devotee regarding all as the riches of the King. When in ananda samadhi , he/she sees that Small Face has become all. When merged in the supernal effulgence, there is the singular modification that “I AM the Truth.” In fana il fana (Ar. extinction of extinction), even the “I AM” disappears. \t ,0*\u0006\u0002\u0006*\u001e' \u0011\u001f -\u0002\u0016\u0006*\u0016,\u001d Before you meditate, prepare both your external and internal environments. The external environment is the setting in which the meditator practices, and the internal environment is the mind. The practices that each aspirant employs is a matter of individual choice. It is important to develop “inner listening” skills to connect with and “hear” the Divine guidance that issues from within, or sometimes, through surprising external sources. As a mystic on the Path, your individual life is your current yogic teaching story by which the Divine leads you through karmic lessons and the process of spiritual growth. So, be vigilant throughout the course of your days and in your dream state for those moments when God is communicating with you. Once on the path, there are no coincidences, no accidents. Try to make your meditation a routine part of your life. It is best if you can do it at approximately the same times each day, and it is important to be regular and not to allow laziness to excuse yourself from practice even when you are tired or busy. A little bit of concentrated, high quality practice is better than a lot of low- quality, unfocused practice."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0004 \u0007\u0003\u0001\u00052\u0001\u0006\" \u0015+\u0016 It is also important to use common sense in the process of maintaining a routine of spiritua l practices. For example, if you take food late at night, especially if it is rich or spicy, there is a good chance that your mind will be agitated or sluggish while meditating before going to sleep. Taking such food late at night may also impact your dream state, and your mental condition during your meditation the following morning. Some people feel that psychotropic drugs enhance spiritual practices or even facilitate spiritual progress. However, many high level yogic masters from all mystical traditions have warned that this is not the case. Immoderate use of such substances can, in fact, dull the mental instrument, diminish the quality of meditation, obstruct conscious dreaming, and destabilize the nervous system. The following sections discuss how to prepare the external and internal environments for meditation. A simple routine of meditation practices involving a root mantra and complimentary visualization, as well as, a more elaborate routine of practices will be presented. These two examples will typify a Small Face- centered practice. This material will be followed by a Vast Face- centered routine of meditation, for those who do not have an attraction to focusing on God- with-Form. Some additional visualizations and walking meditation practice will be discussed later. Customize your own routine according to what appeals to you, and experiment with some of the auxiliary practices. \u0006 \u0005, \u0011, =\u0006,-'\u0002\u0004 \u0011, '8*-\u001e'\t,'\u0006 Create a dedicated place where you will engage in your practice on a regular basis.

If space permits, it is ideal to dedicate an entire separate room, where one maintains a shrine and in which one engages only in spiritual activities, thoughts, and speech. If space does not permit the spiritual dedication of an entire room, then at the very least try to have a comfortable, quiet place in your home where you can regularly meditate without interruption.

Since the room is to be completely dedicated to the Lord hvhy , it would be appropriate to attach a mezuzah (small encased scroll) on the right doorpost. Jews have placed mezuzim on their doorposts since ancient times to distinguish their households as Jewish, as a talisman to ward off evil, and as a device to trigger remembrance of the Divine when entering and leaving a house. The central element in the mezuzah scroll is the Affirmation of Unity, the Shema . A shrine should be installed, if possible, on the eastern wall of the room. It is said that shri nes are spiritually alive and “build themselves.” A shrine within the context of the Mystical Qabalah is an utterly personal construct. It is not an altar as it is construed within the context of the Practical Qabalah, but a place where you go to honor and commune with the Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of All Things, however you envision or think of Him and Her or It. If your shrine centers upon Small Face, such as the Lord hvhy , then you may choose, as many do, to have a place to put flower and incense offerings. It is also propitious to light a candle and keep it burning during your meditation and devotional activities. And, of c ourse, your mother taught you to be careful with fire. One may also choose to keep a small bowl of water on the altar, as well as, any other articles that you feel are appropriate. Even if you commonly wear shoes in the rest of your home, you should remove them before entering your shrine room, which you can think of as “God’s room.” Try to leave the world outside before entering it. You may want to make ablution before entering God’s room. It is quite sufficient to wash your hands and face. In many traditions, people also wash their feet and wipe a little water on their heads. If you are focusing on the Lord hvhy as your Small Face Chosen Ideal, then you might want to place an image on the wall that displays the Name. A previous section described the visualization of the Sinatic or Ezra Hebrew Name as dancing letters of fire (of various co lors according to one’s choice) against a solid circular background. One can use either the horizontal or Yo s h e r form of the Name hvhy .

Constructing the letter s and the light blue background of the Tzimtzum from “day-glo” colored material, which glows when a black light is shined upon it, is an interesting enhancement. If you elect to do it this way, remember that it is unhealthy to expose your eyes directly into the blacklight. With the black light on, the Tzimtzum becomes very three- dimensional. The Name hvhy seems to come off the wall, and the Tzimtzum appears to be floating in a soft blue charged light. Even without the black light, the day glo letters are quite vibrant. Create a soft, comfortable place to sit on. It is helpful to elevate your buttocks by sitting on an extra pillow, small piece of foam, or zafu (raised pillow used by Zen meditators). You may or may not choose to support your back against a wall. If you do let the wall support your back, you may want to put something soft between your back and the wall, and you may wish to augment support to your lumbar spinal region. Try to maintain good posture while you are meditating. Keep your spine and your head upright but not rigid. It is good to cross your legs, but it is not necessary to maintain the sever ity of a “lotus position.” The operative words here are “upright but comfortable,” so that you can engage in extended meditati on without being distracted by your body. (If you are unable to sit with legs crossed on a flat surface, you may elect to sit in a chair.) Place your hands comfortably on your knees, palms down or up. You can alternately place them in your lap, with either the fingers of the two hands entwined or with the back of your right hand resting in the palm of your left. If you choose to use prayer beads, then play them with your right hand and place your left hand on your left knee or in your lap.

Perhaps they had a stressful day, or experien ced some emotional upset within the context of their personal or professional relationships. Maybe they awoke from a disturbing dream or had a night of restless sleep. It is therefore very importa nt to take the time, before you start to engage in your chosen meditation practice, to calm the mind and truly relax. Recalling the words of the Beatles song “Tomorrow Never Knows,” “Turn off your mind, relax, and float down stream.” 1 The most common way to calm the mind and invoke a relaxation response is to employ a breathing practice for a brief period of time. When a person is agitated, their breathing becomes shallower and less oxygen gets to the brain. Hence, it is very helpful to preface one’s meditation session with a breathing practice. One such practice in the Mystical Qabalah is to silently use the two syllables “ Ya h H u ” in coordination with the breath. Ya h is the B’riyatic pronunciation of the first two letters of the Name hvhy . Hu ( avh ) commonly means “He,” and is associated with the throat center. Inhale gently and slowly through your mouth. Quietly draw the breath in with the syllable “yah,” and allow the air to fill down into your abdomen. Feel the inhaled syllable draw divine light in through the forehead center. Let that YH -Light continue downward to the throat center. When you come to the end of the inhale, let it turn seamlessly into the exhalation, and breath out with the syllable “hoo.” As you exhale, feel the Hu breath descend out from the throat center and move down to fan the flames of the letters of the Name hvhy in the heart center. Continue to inhale and exhale gently while intoning the respective syllables for a minute or two. You may find it useful to connect the breath intonations with the mental sensation of ocean waves gently breaking on the shore and then pulling back out, or with a wind rhythmically sweeping through a valley. After you are done breathing th e syllables audibly through your mouth, you can continue to do so silently while breathing through your nostrils. Breathing in and out through your nostrils, you will find that you instinctively press your tongue gently up against the hard palate. Furthermore, breathing in and out through your nostrils in this manne r is appropriate for meditation"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0004 \u0007\u0003\u0001\u00052\u0001\u0006\" \u00155\u0015 practices. This is also the healthiest way to breathe. If you do not already breathe through your nostrils down into and out from the lower abdominal area as a matter of habit, practicing it while meditating will help you to do so. Perform the breathing practices in a comfortable manner, without strain. Don’t overfill your lungs on the inhalations, or exha le until every last bit of air is pushed out. You might also find it desirable to slowly chant for a while before you engage in a breathing practice. You could use “ Yah Hu ,” or any other Divine Names that appeal to you. Place the tip of your tongue gently against the hard palate behind your upper teeth. Take a breath in through your nose. Let the tongue drop down and intone the syllables. \u001d *\t\u001f\u0004, \u0011- \u001e \u0006*', \u0011 \u001e. \u0011\u001d \t\u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, /\u0016 ,'\u0006,-,0 \u0011 \t ,0*\u0006\u0002\u0006*\u001e' If you are looking for the bottom line of Mystical Qabalistic practice, the statement “Chant the Name of God and wake up; the Holy One is the only Teacher, so get off your Gatekeeper’s back” pretty much sums it up. Through the repetition of a Small Face root mantra over time, and the grace of the Lord hvhy , the mind of the meditator is gradually transformed and awakened to the underlying Reality, the root Caus e, the Dreamer of the Dream. As everyone learns in early childhood, “Row, row, row, your boat, gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.” If life is but a dream, then who is the dreamer? Answering this question is the purpose of all Small Face meditation in all mystical traditions. In the Mystical Qabalah, the Dreamer is the Lord hvhy , and the Dreamer and the Dream are One. Love, lover, and beloved are One. Knowledge, knower, and That which is known are One. Since the Lord hvhy is the active aspect of the Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of All Things ( Ayn ), then He/She/It is the Teacher at the root of all teachers. This lies at the heart of the admonition not to get attached to, or become the slave of, any earthly teacher. This does not mean that we should not love, honor, and revere holy people, especially those who have been brought to us by the grace of God to help us on our path.

It is to that Divine Sour ce that we should ultimately cling and offer our unconditional devotion. Thus, there is the injunction to “get off your Gatekeeper’s back,” because that guide is only the one who is pointing you to the open gate and urging you to go through it. This is wonderfully framed in Zen Buddhism by the story of the roshi who points to the moon with his finger, and admonishes the as pirant not to confuse the finger with the moon. In regard to a simple routine of meditation practice, having calmed the mind with a short pe riod of breathing as described above, the meditator would then commence the repetition ( zakhor , remembrance) of the root mantra that appeals to their mind. Earlier, a number of the root mantra found in the To r a h were highlighted, including “ Ani hvhy ” and the Affirmation of Unity i.e. the “ Shema .” Let’s say that you have decided to take “ Ah-ni Yod Heh Vav Heh ” as the mantra you wish to use. Sit in a relaxed and posturally sound position, and begin to slowly repeat the phrase. Try to get into a comfortable rhythmic cadence. As you repeat the mantra, visua lize the Hebrew letters of the Name hvhy as dancing letters of fire against a solid circular background, surrounding which is a light blue background. See that visualization either within your heart center or “before your eyes.” You may choose to see th em either as Sinatic Hebrew letters or Ezra Hebrew letters. You may elect to see the horizontal version of the Name hvhy or the vertical Yo s h e r form (Figure 2.3 on page 67, Figure 6.1 on page 168, Figure 7.1 on page 194, and Figure 7.2 on page 195). It is possible to do this with your eyes open or closed. See the letters in the color that appe als to you—fire orange red, white, gold, etc. While you could use diff erent colors for the circular Tzimtzum , black is recommended. Do not make the act of visualization a stressful process, and don’t expect to literally see what you are visualizing right away. Visualization is a skill that requires cultivation. It begins as an act of creative imagination. Over time, with diligence and grace, it deepens into something much more real."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0004 \u0007\u0003\u0001\u00052\u0001\u0006\" \u00155\u0018 When you first begin to do mantric meditation, you will notice that thoughts continue to rise in your mind while you are silently repeating the mantra. Do not struggle to stop your thoughts: just let them rise and disappear in your mind, like seeds that gently burst and dissipate. The mantra gives a part of your mind an anchor, so that the procession of thoughts floats by without taking you with it. You will probably have lapses in your visualization. Whenever you find your attention drifting off course, just try to be diligen t about bringing your mind back to the task at hand, without letting th e tricky voice of self-criticism steal your attention. The reader is again reminded how important it is to limit the amount of mantric repetition you do in the beginning. Go slowly, and increase the amount in small increments over a substantial period of time. Each individual should test the water to determine how much they are comfortable doing at the onset, and how much and how often to increase the amount. When you start silent mantric repetition, limit the duration to ten to fifteen minutes when you awaken in the morning, and that much again before you go to sleep. If you tend to wake up very groggy, you may wish to apply some cold water to your face before you begin, so that you do not fall back to sleep while sitting up. This is not an uncommon occurrence. If you have a hard time staying awake while you are meditating before you go to sleep, you may wish to do your practice a little earlier while you are still alert. Increase the sessions by five minutes or less per month, according to what feels right for you, until you are sitting for a maximum of forty-five to sixty minutes. Also, as mentioned before, begin your practice of mantric repetition with a slow, rhythmic cadence. You may wish to increase the speed of the repetition as time goes. As you get more advanced, the repetitions can become quite rapid, amounting to thousands of repetitions per session. When you come to the end of your session of silent chanting, don’t stop and get up abruptly. Cease chanting and just “listen” to the quietness, allowing the power that you have generated to soak in. Bring closure to your practice by bowing in your heart to your dear Lord and offer Him/Her the fruits of your yogic efforts. You may wish to engage further in prayer at that time.

So, by way of example, this section presents a more elaborate process. In a more elaborate routine of practices, as soon as you open your eyes in the morning, before all else, mentally praise the Lord and give thanks for another day of embodied human life and the grace of being on the path of spiritual awakening. If you have been sleeping with a partner, silently acknowledge their inherent divinity as the Lord hvhy or Queen Shekhinah , respectively. Attend to any calls of nature, and then make ablution, washing your hands and face, and if you wish, your feet. After making ablution, proc eed to your dedicated room or spot where you have your shrine. At the doorway, touch the fingers of your right hand to your lips, then to the mezuzah on the doorpost, and then to your heart. Bow to the shrine and then enter. Go to the altar and kneel down before your shrine, briefly casting your gaze successively upon all the objects there, and finally upon the image of the Name hvhy in the Tzimtzum against the blue Light of the Endless. The next step is to make prostration. Before people walk, they crawl; first on their bellies, then on their hands and knees. Long before that, the fetal position is experienced in the womb. Prostration blends postures that are deeply embedded in human consciousness. Placing the forehead to the Earth is a primordial act of reverence, unification, and extinction. The religious act of prostration is found in some fo rm in virtually all faiths. As practiced in Islam for instance, prostration ( sujud ) is a central component in the ritual of prayer ( salat ) that is performed five times every day. Buddhists are well known for performing long series of continuous prostrati ons in the course of making pilgrimage to a holy site, or when circumambulating such a site. Devout Hindus are often seen pros trating before shrines and in “taking the dust” of their Guru’s feet. Christian priests and nuns make prostration in the form of the Cross, with arms stretched out to the sides. Prostration beautifully portrays the drama of individuated consciousness alternatively manifesting and becoming extinct. In the alternating manifestation and extinction of individual"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"% \u0006E2\u0005\u0003\u00052\u0011\u0012 \u0010 \u0003\u0012E \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0004 \u0007\u0003\u0001\u00052\u0001\u0006\" \u00155\u0016 consciousness, we can see perfectly reflected the macrocosmic manifestation and dissolution of the One-Small-Face-Universe. Prostration is practiced in all the world’s mystical traditions as an act of reverence, remembrance, and humility. Perform your acts of prostration with a focused intention, dwelling upon the act of extinction in the Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of All Things as you place your forehead to the ground, and the act of manifestation of the Small Fa ce universe as you rise back up. Next, light the candle while intoning the Sabbath blessing: “ Baruch atah Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohenu Melech haOlam , Asher kiddeshanu buhmitzvotav vitzivanu luhhadlich ner shel Shabat .” Lighting a candle with this blessing is appropriate because, for a Mystical Qabalist, there are no regular days of the week, and every day is Shabat . Then, take some incense, stand up before your shrine, and seal the six directions with the permutations of the Name vhy . This practice is derived from the thirteenth verse of the first chapter of the Sefer Yetzirah ( Book of Formation ): “Three letters from the simple ones (Yod y , Heh h , Va v v ); He sealed Air through three and set them into His great Name vhy and sealed through them six extremities: Five: He sealed (Sefirah) Height and He turned upward and sealed it with vhy ; Six: He sealed Abyss and He turned downward and sealed it with hvy ; Seven: He sealed East and He turned forward and sealed it with vyh ; Eight: He sealed West and He turned backward and sealed it with yvh ; Nine: He sealed South and He turned right and sealed it with hyv ; Ten: He sealed North and He turned left and sealed it with yhv .”"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"\u00155+ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% Light the incense. Facing East (i.e. front), look upward. Point the incense above the head and circle its tip. Intone the letters “YOD HEH VAV” vhy while visualizing them as “letters of fire.” Continue to point and circle the incense in successive directions, and invoke and visualize their respective sequences of letters: Below/Down - “YOD VAV HEH” hvy ; then, East/Front -“HEH YOD VAV” vyh , then West/Behind - “HEH VAV YOD” yvh ; South/Right -“VAV YOD HEH” hyv , then North/Left - “VAV HEH YOD” yhv . Having sealed the six directions , once again kneel before the shrine and make a flower offering. Hold the flower between your thumb and forefinger in front of your thoracic center, with your left hand palm up cupped beneath it. Make a final prostration, rise, and go to your meditation seat. After sitting down, settle into an appropriate posture a nd wrap yourself in your prayer shawl. Chant the Divine Names from the Sefer HaShmoth (see Appendix A). Then, perform th e breathing practice described earlier for a short while to further calm the mind and relax the body. At this point, if you have an embodied teacher, focus on their image for a short while and the Name hvhy ablaze in their heart. If you do not have an embodied teacher, you could similarly focus on the image of one of the Hebrew patriarchs (or matriarchs), or on a ny Messiah, saint or spiritual master for whom you feel an affinity. You may then wish to use one or more of the ancillary visualizations discussed in a later section. The ancillary visualization, which may or may not be accompanied by the repetition of the root mantra, is followed by the commencement of the silent repetition of the primary root mantra “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh ” as described above. When you have completed the silent chanting of “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh ,” silently or audibly chant the ShemAyn ten times, “ Shem Ayn Yisroel Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohenu Yod Heh Vav Heh EchaD ” Upon the final repetition of the ShemAyn , draw out the last syllable of “ Echad ” and let it turn into “ OD ” (pronounced “ood,” lit.

This more elaborate set of practices has been framed within the context of a morning ritual. You could ostensibly repeat the same ritual at night before retiring, or with modifications according to personal taste. The range from the most simple routine to the elaborate gives the reader a blueprint of possibilities rather than a mandate for cookie cutter replication.

It is not unusual for an aspirant to start noticing some subtle changes not long after commencing their meditative discipline. Events in your life will start feeling less accidental, less coincidental, and they will give you more of a sense that God is teaching you through your lifestream and your relationships with others. It is also not unusual for aspirants to notice subtle differences in their sleeping and dream life. It is a good practice to try to stimulate conscious dreaming. By falling asleep on your back while repeating the mantra, or holding on to some thought or image, you may start to experience consciously leaving your body and being awake in your Geviyah (astral body) in Yetzirah (World of Formation). This can be somewhat unsettling in the early stages, until you get accustomed to the experience and more familiar with the process. Try not to panic. At first, you will likely try to move around in your Geviyah the same way that you move in your physical body. You will try to move your legs and arms as if to walk, and feel unable to do so.

Once you get accustomed to being awake in your Geviyah , it becomes possible to travel (and see and hear at) considerable distances, move through apparently solid objects, make contact with beings who dwell in this plane, and even “read” the Earth’s Akashic record. A variety of psychic abilities can awaken. This can be quite stimulating, and is potentially an addictive distraction. If such abilities do arise in the course of your spiritual awakening, it is generally recommended that you renounce and ignore them in order to avoid the potential pitfalls. When you awake in your Geviyah , it is best to commence the same meditation practice of re petition of root mantra and visualization that you do in your waking state. The Geviyah is a potent platform from which to engage in zakhor . Here you do not have the distractions of your phys ical body, such as an itchy nose or achy knees. When consciously going through the Gate of the Gimel g into the World of Yetzirah, the experience of the Watcher on the Threshold can be unnerving. The Watcher is a mirror that reflects the imprint of residual impressions and mazal accumulated over many lives. Mazal (Sanskrit karma) is a process of cause and effect, described by the adage, “A s ye sow, so shall ye reap.” This implies that the circumstances into which you have taken birth and the ensuing stream of life experience is effected by what you have done previously. It is quite typical for people to run from this experience. Over time, the process of mantric repetition clears this “encrustation,” whereby you can see the reflection of your Higher Self as your Chosen Ideal. The mirror may become clear. When you come to the experience of the Watcher, keep chanting the Name. Fight the impulse to flee, and will yourself to go directly through it. In consciously going through the Watcher, you move into the qlifah of the Holy Spirit ( Ruach HaQodesh ) in Sefirah Beauty/ Last in the World of B’riya h (Creation). This is normally experienced as deep sleep.

In this experience, as generally filtered through the astral senses of the Geviyah , there is the exclusive vision of yourself “at the feet of,” so to spea k, your beloved Small Face Chosen Ideal. For a Mystical Qabalist, this would be the Lord hvhy . This experience is accompanied by great waves of bliss that can get quite intense (and potentially addictive). For one reason or another, you may find yourself unable or unwilling to become active in your Geviyah . Most people will sporadically become conscious in their dream state, and be blessed with more or less occa sional ecstatic visions originating from the dream state. The frequency of such experiences is not a testimony to one’s spiritual adva ncement. Some people have one profound experience that changes and effects them for their entire life. Others have numerous experiences, but still seem to regress to baser ego states and cling to a long shopping list of desires. Your spiritual advancement will be reflected in the emergence of higher qualities of ch aracter that results from the decreased identification of the ego with your lower nature. The qualities include unconditional love and devotion toward your Chosen Ideal, seeing the whole world and all beings as one’s own, renunciation of the fruits of work, the desire to engage in selfless service, etc. The experience of ananda samadhi with the Small Face Chosen Ideal is generally the goal of Small Face yoga. This experience will permanently establish the fractal reprogramming of the cerebral cortex. The spiritually awakened mind of the aspirant is firmly stationed in the awareness that the manifest Creation is a unity in their Small Face Chosen Ideal, even in the waking state of Sefirah Kingdom. Ge nerally, one so established will have a particular bhava , or devotional mood, toward Small Face. It may be that of servant to the Lord as Divine Master or King/Queen, child to the Lord as Divine Parent, parent to the Lord as Divine Child, or lover to the Lord as the Divine Beloved. The play of the Holy Spirit in the awakened soul is, indeed, a wondrous mystery. For the vast majority of people in this “Dark Age of Kali ,” samadhi experiences will initiate in the dream state in Yetzirah. This dream state samadhi is called shushupta samadhi in Sanskrit.

They will pass through the rest of their life absorbed in their love and devotion for their Small Face Chosen Ideal, and engage in service to their Lord as embodied in all beings. When the Nefesh falls away at the end of their life, they will make the transition into a bliss-filled experience of their Small Face Ideal, which will endure for the remainder of the Small Face universe. This experience comes to an end when “Face turns to Face,” and the manifest Creation on all planes is dissolved in the substratum of the Ayn . As a Mystical Qabalist, your beloved Lord hvhy is your guide, your “guru.” He /She will unfold your spiritual path and inspire you to do what is right for you. It is most beneficial to spend time in the company of holy people. While it is of course desirable to find extraordinary souls within the same mystical tradition that naturally interests you, it is also valuable to spend time in the presence of any ge nuine saint and master from any tradition. It is also important to seek out and keep the company of other people who, through divine grace, are actively involved in spiritual growth, and with whom you can pray, meditate, sing, and discuss spiritual ideas. \u0002 00*\u0006*\u001e'\u0002\u0004 \u0011\u001d \t\u0002\u0004\u0004 \u0011. \u0002\u0016, \u00118 *\u001d \u0002\u0004*:\u0002\u0006*\u001e'\u001d The primary texts of the Mystical Qabalah have a wealth of allusive imagery that can be used in an active process of creative imagination, in conjunction with Small Face-centered meditation practices.

All of the root mantra that have been mentioned above include mechanisms for making the transition into Vast Face, if by chance one has the presence of mind to renounce the blissful experience of Small Face. However, in practice, most people will find that they are unable to do so. Even fewer individuals in these latter days have the innate mental and spiritual constitution to ignore Small Face completely and engage in solely Vast Face-centered practices. While Small Face meditation practices use a process of directed imagination to unite all experiences in the realms of Name and Form, the aspirant on the path of the Tree of Perfection after the Ayin cultivates dispassion and discrimination to systematically renounce and negate every experience, until the individuated consciousness dissolves in the Ayn like a “salt doll walking into the ocean.” Hence, exercises which cultivate discrimination (Sanskrit viveka ) and one-pointed concentration (Sanskrit samyana ) are a central element in the Vast Face practices of most mystical traditions. Such practices might involve the use of inscrutable imagery (e.g. the koans found in some schools of Zen Buddhism), open-ended questions (e.g. “Who am I”), or strings of thought intended to lead the mind beyond finite rationality. Consider the following examples: 1. Imagine objects of increasingly larger size until greater than the size of the Multiverse: Physical Body → Earth → Sun → Galaxy → Universe → Multiverse → Pure Energy beyond Multiverse. 2. Imagine objects of increasingly smaller size until smaller than the size of the smallest nucleonic particle: Physical Body → Fertilized Cell → Atomic Nucleus → Planck Dimension in One Atomic Nucleus → Beyond Planck Dimension (logic stops).

Vast Face, often called Atiqa (Hidden One) in qabalistic texts, is distinguished by the contrary image of the white-haired and be arded Ancient of Days. Qabalah also alludes to Small Face as Shekhinah , Holy Queen and Divine Mother, and to Vast Face as the Ancient Mother. In the Tantra, Small Face is alluded to as the black-bodied Goddess Kali , who is seen emerging from the chest of Vast Face—the inert, ashen- white form of Shiva . Their union underscores the fact that the difference between the two Faces is only distinguished by human thought. The Tantra also has Small Face images of Shiva as Rudra , and female images of Vast Face such as Mahakali . These variations reinforce the flexibi lity within mystical worldviews to present aspirants with a range of viable options for their Chosen Ideals. A shrine room dedicated to the practice of Vast Face-centered meditation might look different from one that centers upon Small Face. If a Tzimtzum is placed upon the wall of the altar, it may be devoid of content and bear only the surrounding Vast Face image of Leviathan, surrounded by the clea r blue Light of the Endless. Another object that might be included in a shrine to Vast Face is a smooth vertical stone, called a lingam in the Tantric tradition. The lingam represents the erect penis, and is symbolic of the yang or “male” potency of Vast F ace. As part of the Tantric ritual involving a lingam , the priest or celebrant pours milk or some other special liquid mixture over the stone. The reader may certainly find it odd to include an apparently Tantric article of worship on a Mystical Qabalistic altar. However, the ancient Hebrews had a ritual similar to the anointing of the lingam, which is mentioned prominently on a number of occasions in the To r a h . Two different chapters in Torah B’reshith mention two separate instances of a ritual performed by the Patriarch Ya’aqov, in which he “anointed with oil” and “poured a libation over” the stone pillar he erected at Beth El . 5 This obviously important component of the ancient Hebrew religion is conspicuously absent from modern Judaic ritual. Relative to external ritual, it may appeal to the Vast Face aspirant to make ablution before entering the shrine room. He/ she may then also want to perform prostration before the altar,"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"\u0017\b+ ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% light a candle and burn incense, and offer a flower to the Ancient of Days. In essence, these are acts of devotion to God-without- Name-and-Form. At this point, if a stone lingam is included as a central feature on the altar, one would pour milk or an unguent oil over it, and intone the mantra: “ Yod Heh Vav Heh, Yod Heh Vav Heh El Rachum vuh Chanun Arikh Afim ” (“YHVH YHVH El Merciful and Compassionate (who is) Vast Face”). In Vast Face Yoga, the internal environment is prepared as in the Small Face routine. After you don a shawl and become comfortably seated, intone a Vast Face root mantra out loud, followed by some breathing practice to calm the mind and relax the body. At this point, you may wish to visualize your teacher, if they have one, or any Gatekeeper to whom you feel a connection. You can then proceed to consciously follow or witness the breath, allowing the consciousness to move progressively deeper, and ignoring all thoughts and image s that arise in the mind. This is a common practice in many mystical traditions. Vast Face meditation can also involve th e repetition of root mantra, combined with visualizations of allusions that are specific to Vast Face. In the Mystical Qabalah, three of the most prominent Vast Face root mantra are: “ Ani Ayn ” (lit. “I am Nothing”), “ Shomer Mah Mehlylah ” (lit. “Watcher WHAT of the Night”), and “ Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh ” (lit. “I will be THAT I will be”). While remaining conscious of the breath, silently repeat the root mantra. If you wish to visualize an allusory image in conjunction with the mantra, you can picture the image of the Leviathan encircling the empty Tzimtzum (described above), or see the white-haired Ancient of Days or Ancient Mother. The images can be seen either in front of the eyes or in the forehead center. Your eyes can be open or closed. Since Vast Face-centered aspi rants are not focusing on a form or attribute of Small Face, they will generally experience Sefirah Beauty/Last as formless and empty in the World of B’riyah. If the bliss of ananda samadhi with Small Face does arise, it is renounced and ignored as an illusion. They will then continue to move up the Central Column through the Gate of the Alef a , over the Face of the Abyss of the invisible Sefirah Knowledge/ First, and into the World of Atziluth in Sefirah Crown/Above.

When the connection is opened up to the negatively existent substratum, all the programming in the neuronic synapses of the cerebral cortex is completely shattered by this experience, always. You can only continue by leaving a copy of your programming in Small Face at the edge of the Great Void BEFORE you access the negatively existent substratum, with any changes that you wish to make “to the file.” You continue as this program if/when you reenter the Small Face Creation as a differentiated being.

You can also place an executable code in the “Silver Cord” of the Geviyah , which establishes a vibrational affinity between the “Salt Doll” copy you leave in Small Face and the “Stone Doll” in the Ayn.

In each of us, the Shekhinah wanders in a fallen state (Sefirah Kingdom), until Shabat comes and our consciousness unites with the One True Spouse hvhy . Our Tree thereby becomes perfect (Kingdom returns to its position as the Sefirah Knowledge/First). God is the true spouse. The Lord hvhy is the Husband, and the Lord hvhy is the Bride. Hence, genuine Qabalists are sometimes referred to as “Husbands of Shekhinah ” or “Brides of Adonai .” Each individual should therefore meditate upon the wedding of King Messiah and His Sabbath Bride as something going on in their own consciousness, and at the same time, in the whole universe. All marriages allude to this Divine Union. If married, husband should honor wife as the embodiment of the Shekhinah —he should “meet the Bride.” And wife should honor husband as the embodiment of the Lord hvhy King Messiah, as in the refrain of “Come, my Dear One...” Alas, for some, Shabat never comes and every day is regular. But, as has been said , there is the secret in Qabalah that there are no regular days, only Shabat ! This is always so for a true Master of the Name.

The practices of the Mystical Qabalah are fluid and flexible, and provide fertile opportunity for us to use our imaginations in a creative and personally meaningful way. \u001d ,\u0004.\u0004,\u001d\u001d \u0011\u001d ,-8*\u0016, Most faiths, and many sects within each faith, often find much to disagree about. But, all of them teach that helping people is good . Masters and saints in all mystical traditions encourage selfless service as an important part of any Small Face spiritual discipline. In Judaism, selfless service is called performing a mitzvah , a good deed. In India, it is called seva (pronounced, “save-ah”). In Buddhism, it is called dana (pronounced, “donna”). Volunteering one’s time to bring some company and joy to isolated elderly, feeding the hungry and homeless, visiting and actively listening to people who are confined by their disabilities or illnesses. All of these, and many other ways of giving of yourself are humbling, help purify the ego, and provide a poignant reminder of the impermanence and inevitable suffering of embodied life. Truly, this type of giving is a gift to the giver. It puts faith into action. It is an act of living zakhor (remembrance of the Divine). Whatever service you voluntarily engage in, it is importa nt to remain conscious of the Divine embodied in the person or people whom you are serving, and to offer the fruits of your efforts at the feet of the Lord."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\u0017\u00154 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003%"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"\u0006\u000b \u001e\u001aA6\r \u0001\t\u000b\f\r\u000e\u0016 \u0018\u000e\u0014!\b\u0012\r\u0018\u0013\u0011\"\u0007\u000f\f\u0011#\u0014\u001c\u0011\u0002\u0010\u0012\b\u000f\u0017$\u0018\u0014% . *'\u0002\u0004 \u0011\u0016 \u001e\t\t,'\u0006\u001d \u0011 \u001e' \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011\u001f -\u0002\u0016\u0006*\u0016,\u001d \u0011 \u001e. \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011 \t #\u001d\u0006*\u0016\u0002\u0004 \u0011\u0001 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0005 One of the truly great advantages of human incarnation is the exposure to a relatively rapid pr ocess of change. Every day the sun rises and falls, things manifest and decay, bodies are born, age rapidly, and die. This makes it much easier for people to have a sense of the impermanence of all things, thereby inspiring them to seek within themselves That which does not change through the waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep states. Still, most people waste the precious life given to them. By blindly pursuing selfish desires, and embracing the lure of lust and greed, they deny themselves their birthright: the glorious awakening in the ascent of the Tree. Your Chosen Ideal is your true guru , alive and awake in your heart, “as close as your jugular vein.” The Lord is the best of all teachers, the root of all teachers. Pray to your Chosen Ideal as your all in all, as your very own. Appeal for grace and unconditional love. Renounce the frui ts of all your good works in the world. Use the gift of your discriminative faculty to discern the Real from the Unreal. Be vi gilant in your remembrance, and whole-hearted in your surrender. Talk with your Chosen Ideal as if He/She is right here with you (because He/She is!). Don’t let formality cover your Lord’s Face. Your Chosen Ideal is the dearest of the dear, the nearest of the near; your closest friend, mother, father, brother, and sister; your precious child, husband, wife, and paramour; the stranger whom you pass on the street. In the words of Sri Saradamani Devi, wife of Sri Ramakrishna, “No one is a stranger, my child. The whole world is your own.” 1 All aspects of your life can be used for yoga. If you are practicing Vast Face Yoga, do not be intolerant or trivialize those who meditate on God-with-Form.

On the other hand, devotees should regard with proper respect those who pursue the path of knowledge of God-without-Form with firm resolve and earnest intent i.e. “different strokes for different folks.” Through the vehicle of his extraordinary life, Master Ramakrishna demonstrated the an cient Upanishadic teaching that there are many paths leading to the same Truth. 2 Also, the ways and lifestyles of monks should not be confused with the ways and lifestyles of householders living in the maelstrom of the world. Each one according to their way and their mazal or karma. Do not underestimate the power of remembering/repeating root mantra. Progress slowly and surely, and by the grace of the Lord, your soul will not suffer through “dark nights” and your shells will not crack from the impact of the light and power of the higher states of consciousness. To paraphrase the great Swami Vivekananda: when striving for purity do so out of love and not fear; when working, do so as an act of worship rather than from ambition; and when counseling others, serve the Lord rather than the desire for power. 3 Finally, we would like to encourage the reader to recognize and avoid psychic enslavement to wizards posing as advanced Central Column yogis. Such “she pherds” do not tend their flocks as servants of the Lord, but rather act for the enhancement of their own power, fame, and wealth. The Lord doesn’t need your money to accomplish His/Her works, and doesn’t need temples and rabbis, churches and prie sts, and mosques and imams to awaken the hearts of the children. The Lord just wants the faithful intention of your mind, and the complete surrender of your heart. To quote a Bengali devotional chant, “Holy Mother, because Thou lovest the burning ground, I have made a burning ground of my heart, That Thou mayest come there and dance Thy eternal dance.” And, as it says in the last line of the last Psalm 150:6, “ Kol HaNeshamah Tuhhalel hy Hallelu hy .” (“The whole of the Neshamah praises hy , praise be to hy .”) "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"F \u0012\u0001\u0011C\u0006\u00072\u0012\u0013 \u0010$ \u0002\u0003\u0005 \u0010= \u0011F \u0010\u0003 :\u0007\u0006\u0003E= - \u0012\u0011$ \u0017\u00155 \u0005 ,\u0003-,\" \u0011- ,',\"\u0002\u0004 >- ,\u0006 -' \u0011 \u0006\u001e \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u0011- ,\u0004*<*\u001e' \u0011 \u001e. \u0011 \u0006\u0005, \u00110 ,\u001d,-\u0006 \u0011\u0005 ,\u0003-,\"\u001d The universal mystical spirituality that was transmitted through the Children of Abraha m has become filtered by and clothed in a variety of vessels i.e. Desert Hebrew, Israelite Judaic, Rabbinical Judaic, Messia nic Judaic, Pauline Christian, Islamic, and Tantric. Over the course of time, each of these vessels has come to be dominated by the overriding impressions (Sanskrit. samskaras ) of their conventional outgrowths, and substantially altered in theology, practice, and ritual as they expanded and assimilated to different cultural and political milieus. The root mystical teachings at their respective foundations have been overshadowed to the extent that they are viewed as something alien and to be distrusted. The mystical core of their meditation practices has become lost to all but a small number of their adherent s. Their rituals and observances have become disconnected from their original mystical significance, and often distorte d by an admixture of elements from other indigenous religions as a means to expedite missionary expansion among foreign populations. A preponderance of doubt has be en established by numerous biblical scholars and linguistic experts specializing in ancient Semitic languages that none of the current versions of the To r a h and Peshitta are accurate renditions of their originals, replete with additions, corruption, and undifferentiated commentaries. While the Qur’an is the most recent primary revelation, and has been subject to only limited revision, Islamic orthodoxy has blurred many of its verses with forced meanings that are skewed by political agendas and sexual bias. The idea of Jewish Renewa l has become fashionable in recent times, particularly among Baby Boomers. Its growing popularity reflects that a significa nt number of Jews question the spiritual authority of conventiona l Rabbinical Judaism, and yearn for a return of the mystical element to Jewish spiritual practices. A number of alternative Jewish Renewal congregations have recently formed that incorporate some mystical practices into their rituals and meditations. Howe ver, in general, the scope of the Jewish Renewal Movement does not reach back before the development and institutionalization of Rabbinical Judaism."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"\u0017\u0017\b ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% There has yet to emerge a movement among Jews to search for the spiritual roots of the Children of Abraham. This might be described as the return to the original religion of the desert Hebrews, one that centers upon the universal mystical tenets of absolute divine unity, and the primacy of love, renunciation, and discrimination as a means to spiritual awakening. Might this be dubbed “Hebrew Renewal?” The question arises: What was the original religion like as practiced by the desert Hebrew tribes in the time of Abraham and his children? What can we directly infer from the primary revelations? For example, we know from Torah B’reshith that the anointing of a stone pillar (Sanskrit lingam ) with oil, and perhaps other elements, was a prominent component. We know that invoking the Lord hvhy by name i.e. zachor , was a prominent component: \"And to Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. It was then that men began to invoke the Lord hvhy by Name.\" 4 We know from the To r a h , and confirmed by Master Yeshuvah and the Qur’an , that the root commandment upon which the entire tradition and all its branches are based is the “Affirmation of Unity”: “ Shem Ayn Yisroel hvhy Elohenu hvhy EchaD Vuh-ahavta et hvhy Elohenu, Vuh-khol levavkha, Oo-vuh-khol nafshekha, Oo-vuh-khol muhodekha .” 5 “Name Ayn Israel YHVH Thy Elohim YHVH One. And you shall love the Lord Your God. With all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.” The centrality of the Affirmation of Unity is followed in importance by seeing the Divine Source in all beings: “ Vuh-ahavta leh-re’akha chamokha .” “And thou shall love your neighbor as your Self.” If we speculate on what the religious practices of the desert Hebrews might have been, what rituals and observances would"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"F \u0012\u0001\u0011C\u0006\u00072\u0012\u0013 \u0010$ \u0002\u0003\u0005 \u0010= \u0011F \u0010\u0003 :\u0007\u0006\u0003E= - \u0012\u0011$ \u0017\u0017\u0015 they have included? And, without rabbis, priests, or imams, who would have lead the rituals? We know that ablution and prostration would have been significant components. Both Jews and Muslims also pray while standing. We know that the ritual breaking of bread and sipping of wine to respectively acknowledge the Divine Presence in all matter and symbolically demonstrate mastery over the power of illusion would have been root Hebrew practices. These ritual observances later evolved into the Eucharist in Pauline Christianity. If we strip away official holy days that were assimilated from indigenous religions, what holidays would have been celebrated? As in all ancient religions and cultures, the original Hebrew New Year was celebrated on the Vernal Equinox. It was later moved to the fall and “packaged” with Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). This was perhaps done so that the order of the sections of the Ezra To r a h , as read by the rabbis in a yearly cycle, would coincide with the calendar of the Jewish holidays. If started on the Vernal Equinox, that would not be the case. In the quest to reconstruct the ancient religion of the desert Hebrews, what other considera tions should be addressed? What shape, dear reader, would that religion take for you? In these latter days, with the final action of the Lord hvhy as Acharit drawing nearer, it is incumbent upon each of us to claim our birthright for spiritual awakening, and depend solely upon the Divine for grace and for guidance. As it is written: “And in the days of King Messiah there shall be no need that one should teach another; for that One Spirit who in Himself includes all spirits, knows all Wisdom and Unders tanding, Counsel and Might, and is the Spirit of the Knowledge and Fear of the Lord hvhy ; because He is the Spirit comprehending all spirits.” 6 t \u0011"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"\u0017\u0017\u0017 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% \u0019 2\u0013F\u0007\u0006 \u0010\u0006#\u0015 Blessing of the High Priest .;rmsyv hvhy ;krby Yuh-vah-reh-khuh-khah Yod Heh Vav Heh Vuh-yeesh-muh-reh-khah . .;nxyv ;yla vynp hvhy ray Ya-ay-r Yod Heh Vav Heh Paw-naw-v Ay-leh-khah Vee-choo-neh-khah. .,vls ;l ,syv ;yla vynp hvhy asy Yee-sah Yod Heh Vav Heh Pa-nav Ay-leh-khah Vuh-ya-say-m Luh- khah Sha-loh-m . ]ma Ay-meh-n May the Lord hvhy bless thee and keep thee.

Under the military leadership of Shimeon bar Kochba, they established an independent country that lasted approximately five years. They minted their own coins and established a nearly impregna ble stronghold in the city of Betar. Rabbi Akiba, who procla imed Bar Kochba to be the Messiah, was the spiritual leader of the revolt. But, when Bar Kochba wrongly accused and executed Rabbi Eleazar for betraying Betar, Rabbi Akiba and the rest of the rabbis withdrew their support for him. Bar Kochba then attempted to fight the Roman legions without the support of the rabbis, and was sorely defeated. 4 Diaspora is a term most often used to describe the widespread scattering of Je ws outside of Palestine, subsequent to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. 5 Tanakh is an acronym composed of the first letters of each of the principal sections of the Jewish Scriptures: the Torah ( Law ), also known as the “Five Books of Moses”; Naviyim ( Prophets ), which includes a number of historical books ( Joshua , Judges , I Samuel , II Samuel , I Kings , II Kings ), three major prophets ( Isaiah , Jeremiah , and Ezekiel ), and"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"\u0017\u00183 ' \u00038\u0003:\u0003\u0002 H\u0010\u0005 \u0002\u0006 \u0010% =\"\u00052\u0001\u0003: \u0010\u0002 \u0006\u00072\u0005\u0003\u0013\u0006 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010 \u0005\u0002\u0006 \u0010\u0001 \u00022:E\u0007\u0006\u0012 \u0010 \u0011\u0019 \u0010\u0003 8\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0003% twelve minor prophets ( Hosea , Joel , Amos , Obadiah , Jonah , Micah , Nahum , Habakkuk , Zefaniah , and Malachi ); and the Kethuvim ( Writings ), which includes the Psalms , Proverbs , Job , Song of Songs , Ruth , Lamentations , Ecclesiastes , Esther , Daniel , Ezra , Nehemiah , I Chronicles , and II Chronicles ). 6 Peshitta , Matthew 23:7,8. 7 Paingala Upanishad 1:2. 8 The term ‘ Vedanta ’ means “end of the Vedas.” 9 The term Kahuna means “one who transmits ( ka ) the hidden tradition ( huna ).” 10 The nature of the three doctrines of dvaita , vasishtadvaita , and advaita are explicated clearly by Swami Saradananda in Sri Ramakrishna The Great Master , translated by Swami Jagadananda, Sri Ramakris hna Math, Madras, p. 386-389. 11 Torah B’reshith 4:17. 12 The ascension and transformation of Enoch ben Yared is vaguely alluded to in Torah B’reshith 5:24, and related in detail in I Enoch , the first of the two remaining books of Enochian literature traced to the reign of Sheba in Ethiopia.

Before that, the indigenous peoples of Western Europe, whom the Christians called “Pagans,” had celebrated it as Yule, and a number of other traditions as the birthday of solar saviors. The Mithraists, for instance, regarded it as the birthday of Mithra. The Romans celebrated the date as Dies Natalis Solis Invictus , “Day of Birth of the Undefeated Sun.” The Christian observance of the Pentecost replaced the tradition of Whitsunday, the holy day of the Goddess Frigg, the Norse Queen of Heaven and consort of Odin.

Extensive evidence led to the conclusion that the site was the ruins of the ancient city of Ebla. The tablets, dating back to the middle of the third millennium BCE, were the city’s royal archives. In deciphering the tablets, Professor Pettisate (also of the University of Rome) c oncluded that the language was Old Canaanite, even though writte n in Sumerian cuneiform. He found the language to be closer in vocabulary and grammar to Biblical Hebrew than any other Canaanite dialect, including Ugaritic. Ebla was destroyed by the Akkadians circa 1600BCE. The reader is referred to David Rohl’s controversial book A Test of Time: The Bible From Myth to History , Century, London, 1995.

The most recent edition was edited by Reuven Margaliot a nd published in Jerusalem in 1951. 7 All Hebrew letters also have a numerical value e.g. Beyt b (2), Yod y (10), and Resh r (200). Hence, every Hebrew word i.e. formula of letters has a numerological value that is the sum of the values of its constituent letters. In Gematria, connections are made among words that have the same composite numerical values. For example, Ahavah ( hbha lit. Love, composed of the letters Aleph (1), Heh (5), Beyt (2), Heh (5) adding up to 13) has the same numerical value as Echad ( dxa lit. One, composed of Aleph (1), Chet (8), Dalet (4)). The addition of Ahavah (13) and Echad (13) has the numerical sum of 26, same as the Name hvhy (Yod (10), Heh (5), Vav (6), Heh (5)). 8 Hence, the first sentence of the extant Hebrew Torah , written as a sequence of letters not broken down into words, would be: oratavmymshtammyhlaarbtysarb .

The superstring loop is said to be the underlying entity that unifies all forms of energy. 5 On p.167-68 of his book Before the Beginning (Addison Wesley, 1997), Martin Rees de scribes the nature of the negative space expansion energy: “Very early on, the expansion would have been e xponentially accelerated, so that an embryo universe could have inflated, homogenized, and established the fine-tuned bala nce between gravitational and kinetic energy when it was only 10 -36 seconds old...The repulsion arises because space its elf was very different in that initial era. Before the nuclear and electromagnetic forces had acquired their separate identities, empty space (what physicists call “the vacuum”) would have a huge store of energy latent in it; but this form of energy had the seemingly perverse property that it made the pressure negative (in other words space had a tension).” 6 The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. 7 The weak nuclear force is instrumental in radioactive decay and the production of neutrinos. 8 According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary , the term ‘adiabatic’ means “occurring without loss or gain of heat.”"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"\u0001\t\u000b\f\r\u000e\u0016 $!\u0005\b\b\u000b\u0006 \t\u0005\u0013\t\u0015\f\u0006\r\b\t Abyss : refers to the Sefirah Knowledge/First on the Fallen Tree; also called “Face of the Deep.” Acharit (Hebrew: The Last): the fourth and final Celestial Head of Meshiach L’ hvhy corresponding to the filter of the letter Tav.
