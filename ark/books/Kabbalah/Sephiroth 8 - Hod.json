[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"My Qabalah Hod Number 8 Title Glory Image Sexless beautiful male Greek God Hermes Planet Mercury Colour Purple Relationships Legs Magick Spells Truth and Dishonesty Hod is the winged messenger Hermes or the planet Mercury. The seeker of knowledge, the finder of truth, the trickster of magick. Hod knows the spells, brings the message, illuminates the way, but he is not the way. Hod is but a sign post along the road. The energies of the Tree of Life havi ng risen from their base plane of Malkuth , the earth, and traveled through Yesod , the Moon, they enter the state of illumination of Hod the messenger. Having taken the Path of The Fool to rise to Yesod , the first blind step up The Tree of Life, the way then to Hod is via Judgment. Once we accept a form of faith, a religious system, or simply a belief stru cture that we can be comforta ble with, we then use our own powers of Judgment to sort out how we use or live this structure or belief. Every one of us sees their religious belief from differen t eyes. We may have the common base of the written text, hymn, prayer, sutra, chant, fable, myth etc., but we intuitively make our own conscious decision to accept or re ject or even mold and modify the faith to suit our needs or culture. This is were Hod is evident. It is the writing, the knowing and tradition of belief. Not as in Yesod , the faith of knowing, but here a material knowledge that can be physically handed or spoken to the seeker. An interesting path to Hod is directly from Malkuth by passing Yesod along the path of The World. So to take the magickal knowledge of Hod and not participate in the leap of faith through Yesod , we only get the worldly aspects of our religion or belief. We only understand the material parts, the nuts and bolts, but we have no faith, and so we cannot truly believe. From Hod there is the upward path of Death if we try to avoid Tiphareth the Christ centre or Netzach the love of Venus and simply move upward directly to Geburah . This again can be folly as the death of ones heart and love will result when, having taken knowledge, we try to use it directly in passion without having found the love to understand it and also the love to understand ourselves. If we simply try to by pass Netzach and move directly to Tiphareth we will encounter the path of The Tower. Again we can aquire the central love of Tiphareth , but at the price of a cold heartless struggle, striving only for our own needs and never geting the love of Venus from Netzach .

Along this route we will be given all that we ask for and have the time to grasp the knowledge we have been given and experiment in its use. Beware the crossing over the path from Yesod to Tiphareth : The Devil. As we have all the power of The Star with the knowledge of Hod we will be tempted to use this combination by the way of The Devil. Our only salvation is to continue on attracted by the love of Netzach and not fall into the Path of The Devil and drop down The Tree of Life to the base of Malkuth .
