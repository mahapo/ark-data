I, perhaps more than anyone else on Earth, understand the author's reasons for choosing to infer that the text rep- resents a pseudepigraphic effort of his own. To men and women of integrity, a spiritual oath of secrecy is a serious and burdensome com- mitment, and Mr. DuQuette, by means of this elaborate literary cha- rade, has obviously fulfilled his obligations admirably. I, on the other hand, am bound by no such covenants, and because I, too, am com- piling a record of the events of my life with the Master, I am grateful to Mr. DuQuette for allowing me to share some of my memories. It was a wet and stormy night when first I met the Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. I was a young chela of an occult Order then attending initiations in A ..... , a beautiful old German town. I remember the moment distinctly. I was standing on a stack of chairs wielding a huge Japanese katana, swinging it round with ease to impress the assembled neophytes with my skill in the oriental arts, when I was approached by a rotund figure, his beard wafting in the breeze from my blade. \"Little Brother!\" he commanded me in a loud voice, \"You have been meddling with the Qabalah!\" The throng around me seemed to shrink away at his imperious, if somewhat squeaky, voice. I stood transfixed by his gaze, the sword held high above my head. For a long second, there was no sound."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"xu / FOREWORD \"No I haven't,\" I stated calmly, \"But I don't mind having it med- dle with me.\" He looked at me quizzically, seeming to examine my face intent- ly, then turned on his heel and walked away. In my mind I had a sud- den flash of insight. I leapt down from my post and ran after him, throwing myself at his feet. \"M I\" I I' d I: aster. exc arrne ,lOr I now knew I was in the presence of a member of that mystical, mythical Great White Brotherhood I had sought for so long, \"Take me as your pupil-please!\" \"I can't do that,\" he said, \"The Qabalah is not for charismatic rock stars such as yourself It can only be mastered by one who has already lived a full life. You must be married and have accumulated more wealth before you can study as a true Rabbi of the Lord.\" \"But Master, there must be a way-I'll be your secretary, clean your house, shine your shoes, anything! But I must learn the true ~owledge behind the meaninglessness of Number and Symbol that IS my only learning up until this moment.\" \"Well, pop by the house the next time you are in the States, we'll see what we have for you!\" His eyes twinkled. I knew I'd been given a challenge. Did I have the dedication to throwaway my life for this man, and become his servant in the Holy Wisdom of the Qabalah? Sure I did! So it was, and months later I stepped off a plane in New York City, all my belongings packed in a small bag over my shoulder, in search of enlightenment. I had heard that the Rabbi ran a small community in Montauk, composed of only those true initiates that he had personally selected. However, try as I might, I knew of no one who knew the identity of even one of those initiates, so secre- tive was the Order to which they belonged. Over the next years I was to find out why. The Order (I won't give its true name here) was descended from an ancient sect of Essenes who had begun the study of Qabalah after the fall of the biblical Tower of Babel. Their belief was, and is, that any who study the Holy Wisdom share the danger of those unwise FOREWORD / xtu Master Builders of old, whose pride led Jehovah to punish them for daring to come before His Countenance. Thus the Order members vow themselves to complete anonymity on their initiation, so that the Lord cannot find and punish them for their spiritual hubris. Now I understood why the Rabbi, although versed in the wisdom of the Holy Qabalah like no man in this century, had published nothing; indeed his name was unknown even in the occult circles in which I had previously moved. I was to become one of the lucky few intimates of the Rabbi dur- ing my stay. As his secretary, I had access to many of his communi- cations- both material and spiritual. For the former, I was amazed at his contacts around the world. One would never know who he'd be talking to from one day to the next-from a bum in the street in Seattle (\"one of the greatest magi currently alive,\" according to the Rabbi) to a leading politician in Europe (\"well, he tries hard,\" spoken with a deep sigh). His spiritual communications were no less intriguing-he spoke frequently to Goetic spirits and Enochian angels, often over after- noon tea (Earl Grey seemed especially efficacious for this purpose). I rapidly became proficient in shorthand, and always kept a pencil and pad handy-and an eraser, for, as the Rabbi put it: \"Those guys can often benefit from a bit of judicious editing.\" There were many sunny afternoons when we sat together in the garden over a huge pot of steaming tea while the Rabbi pontificated and argued with his Invisible Superiors over the future direction of the Order's work. The notes I took filled several boxes, and I was amazingly grateful for the invention of the Apple Macintosh com- puter which allowed me to finally dump the Rabbi's ancient Burroughs typing machine. Always, always, I asked the Rabbi when I could become a full initiate of the Mysteries; and always received the same answer: that I must be more successful, more wealthy, married, and fruitful before I could even think of being considered as a potential Rabbi myself."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"XlV / FOR E W 0 R D FOREWORD / XV \"B \"1 d \"Yc d ut, proteste, ou nee someone to carryon your work, Master!\" And in those moments his eyes would fallon the picture of Mr. DuQuette 1 that he kept on his desk, along with those of the other initiates. \"Perhaps ... ,\" and he would say no more. Be that as it may, I zealously continued my studies and practices, and eventually it became obvious to all at the Montauk center that I was becoming the Master's favorite. Naturally this gave rise to jeal- ousy and the petty intrigues that are the bane of monastic societies. My chief adversary was a quiet, passive-aggressive student who presumptuously renamed himself Gizmo Ben Lamed. He could type faster than I, and continually jockeyed for my position as Master's secretary. One day, in front of Master and the other pupils, he chal- lenged me to a typing duel. Like a fool I accepted, for to decline would have meant instant victory for Ben Lamed. My defeat was the beginning of the end for my career at Montauk. Gizmo continued to poison the minds of the members of the Order against me, and the Master advanced other neophtyes while I was kept at a low degree. Still, I knew he secretly liked me more than the others, for as he was wont to quote on the many occa- sions when he cuffed me round the side of the head, \"Whom I love, I chastise with many rods.\" One day I could stand it no longer. I burst into the Master's sane- tum. \"I DEMAND to be finally made an initiate of the Qabalah!\" I shouted, \"Teach me the secrets that lie within the Numbers and the Cards!\" Too late, the Rabbi was sitting hunched over his desk accom- panied by Gizmo Ben Lamed, both intently examining what appeared to be an ancient Indian illustrated treatise on advanced magical techniques. They looked up at me. \"Impossible!\" boomed the Master. \"You are far too young and inexperienced. Why, you're not even married!\" My face fell. He was right. He, on the other hand, had somehow tricked a beautiful young girl named Constance into his clutches years before. The rumor was that he had used certain forbidden magical methods to do so, but of that I have no proof-yet. But to continue my history ... Before I could answer, the Rabbi raised a restraining hand and turned to Gizmo. \"He must be given a chance. He must do as our forefathers did, and go to the desert for 40 days and 40 nights to be tried in the pure sight of the Lord. Ifhe survives, it will be dear proof that he has achieved the insignificance that befits a true member of our Order, and can be initiated in due course. Cuddles\" (he always called Gizmo that name for reasons that are still unclear to me), \"You will take him in the morning to be tried. He must find the limits of the City of God.\" Gizmo glared at me, but even he could not go against the mighty Will of the Rabbi. That night I could hardly sleep, no matter how comfortably I arranged my bed of gorse. In the morning I would finally get my chance to prove myself I knew I could do it. Promptly about four hours after sunrise I heard the telltale sound of a Volkswagen camper pull up in the front yard. I ran out and jumped into the seat. Without a word I was blindfolded with a bright canary yellow cloth and we took off. We drove in silence for four days. I knew Ben Lamed and others in the van were burning with jealousy.. How I would show them! At high noon of the fourth day we stopped, and I was ceremo- niously dumped out of the van, which roared off in an unknown direction. I took off my blindfold, took out my trusty Boy Scout knife, and began my walkabout through the desert, putting my faith in the Lord's ability to overlook me until I had found the sign I was looking for. For many days I walked, without real food and water (though I did find a McDonalds by the side of the road that helped a lot). I saw visions of angels with spreading dark wings and demons in the form of beautiful Thai women who tempted me with their slim seductive bodies. But still I prevailed, looking only for that sign that would show me the true Way that I desired. Finally that day came. I had almost given up hope. My vision was"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"XVt / FOR E W 0 R 0 blurred, my mind blank. I tottered on the brink of despair. Then I saw it. The sign. THE sign. The sign that I had looked for day and night since leaving New York: Interstate ~ Las Vegas City Limits Here in a blinding flash was the answer I sought. For was it not man's True Will that raised us to the state between mere animal existence and divinity? And did not the Number 93 epitomize that True Will?2 I had sought the limits of the City of God, and here they were, with- in my own Will, stated plainly within the Holy Qabalah. I marveled once again at the wisdom of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford who had brought me to this place, and at the materialization of the Qabalah upon Earth. Eagerly I strode forward to Las Vegas. Once there I began my studies in earnest. I spent innumerable hours in the casinos, enmeshed in understanding the subtle patterns within the Numbers, the archetypal forces embodied in the Cards, and the Dionysian pleasures brought to me by the Lord's own cock- tail waitresses. I knew that I could not return to the Rabbi without fulfilling the duties he had expounded to me, so for 40 days and nights I threw myself into my work with a passion. My practical studies had led to great things. I was now a wealthy and successful man, with a lovely Asian wife I had found on the Internet. It was time to return to the bosom of the Rabbi. I packed my bags and set off for the Hermetic homeland of Montauk. I turned up at the Rabbi's home. The days had not been kind to him. He looked old and worn, his arms held up by Gizmo Ben Lamed, who was unfortunately still around. I wasted no time in FOR E W 0 R 0 / xuu demanding to be finally initiated into the secrets of the Order. How could they refuse me now? I threw my bag down on my old familiar gorse and fell into a deep and satisfied sleep. The morning dawned bright and clear, and I was brought before the Rabbi, now dressed as I had never before seen him, as a Priest of the Ancient Mysteries. For an old man, he still looked pretty good in a leopard skin. I cannot tell you details of the next seventeen hours, but at the end, he laid his hands upon me. His hands jerked convul- sively upon my now-shaven head, pouring his magical essence into me \"I am now about to consecrate, ordain, raise, and confirm you, an initiate of the Mysteries of ..... , now and forever. But first you will repeat after me the Terrible Oath of Secrecy.\" . He fell forward, his arms around me with joy. After a few nun- utes the position began to get a little uncomfortable, but I endured his weight nonetheless. I could hear Gizmo prompting the Rabbi with the Terrible Oath of Secrecy, but the Rabbi did not stir. Then his body slowly slid to the floor, a horrific expression on his face. He was dead. The Doctor said it was pulmonary infarction. I knew better. With his initiation of me, his life's work was complete. I was now his Follower. A few short months after this I received a call from my old friend, the famous occult editor (and fellow initiate) B., apprising me of Mr. DuQuette's intention to publish the Rabbi's legendary lost manuscripts on the Chicken Qabalah and insinuate that Ben Clifford was merely a figment of his own imagination and the works were his own! I was outraged. As the true heir to the Master's work, I felt. t~~t I and I alone could explain it-for was I not the first and only uuu- ate of our Order never to be sworn to secrecy?

These pious and dedicated Kabbalists- absorbed themselves passionately in a perpetual quest for the revealed word of God. Parallel to this, for hundreds of years non-Jewish mystics have seized many of the tools of Qabalistic study and applied them to Christian,3 heretical, magicalt and, most recently, New Age para- digms. This latter group, while not discarding completely the fasci- nation with the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, focuses primarily on the consciousness-expanding benefits derived from the practice of Qabalistic meditative exercises rather than the parochial revelations resulting from scriptural exegesis. KAB BALAH-CABALA-QbBALAH Understandably, orthodox Kabbalists do not have much respect for Cabalists and Qabalists, and, from their point of view, this snobbery is well justified. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that great spiritual benefit can be derived from Qabalistic thought and exercise, even if the student chooses not to embrace the Hebrew religion, or make a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xx / INTRODUCTION spiritual commitment to traditions or articles of faith which may be incongruent or irrelevant to his or her spiritual worldview. At the present time, disciples of the non-traditional Qabalah rep- resent a much wider spectrum of seekers than that of the orthodox community. Included in this broad band of Qabalistic dabblers are mathematicians, physicists, psychologists, entertainers, as well as stu- dents and practitioners of the Western Hermetic traditions of esoteric Freemasonty, Tarot, Ceremonial Magick, Rosicrucianism, Astrology, and Alchemy. With all due homage and respect to the adepts and tra- ditions of the orthodox Hebrew Kabbalah, it is to this larger group of unorthodox (or non-orthodox) Qabalists that this book is addressed. Q.[\\BALAH-FUN NY? For the last twenty years I have attempted to introduce the Qabalah to students of Tarot and Ceremonial Magick, in particular to those who are interested in the work of the Golden Dawn and/or Aleisrer Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis, The scope of this work is relatively narrow, and deals primarily with the meanings and numerical equiv- alents of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the mysteries of the schematic diagrams known as the \"Tree of Life,\" and the \"Cube of Space,\" and the various exercises with which the diligent student \"connects everything in the universe with everything else until there is no 'anything' left.\" Early on, I discovered that I could quickly convey the fimdamen- tals by using simple anecdotes and metaphors. As the years progressed, these homespun tales have become increasingly colorful, outrageous and, in my humble opinion, quite amusing. Moreover, students and critics repeatedly tell me that they seem to absorb and retain the infor- mation more efficiently (and have a better chance of staying awake) when the material is presented to them in this manner. When I began to organize the material for this book, I realized that the vast majority of readers would not be familiar with my per- INTRODUCTION / XXt sonality and the subtle nuances of my comedic timing. I knew that, if I were to plunge the unsuspecting reader directly int~ the ~aters. of my Qabalistic fairyland, the poor souls would immedl~tely Imagl.ne themselves drowned in pure silliness. So I turned to a literary device that has a long and distinguished history in the world of Qabalistic literature-pseudepigraphy, or the ascription of false names of authors to certain works. Revered Hebrew scholar, Gershom G. Scholem wrote: For a long time we have known that literary forgeries repre- sent a flight into anonymity and pseudonymity just as often as they indicate trickery; and not for nothing ~ave ~e retained the foreign word, \"pseudepigrapha\" to desIgnateÂ· 10 particular a legitimate category of religious literature ... the Zohar is the most important but by far not the only exam- ple of such love of masquerade in Jewish literature. 5 I decided to do just what Rabbi Moshe de Leon did .when he ~~ote the Zohar,6 in the 13th century. He credited aurhorship to a fictitious holy man, Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai, a second-century vic~im of the Roman persecution who, while hiding for thirteen years 10 a cave, was inspired by God to write the Zohar. Scholars may debate whether de Leon or a contemporary was actually the author of the Zohar but none considers the text to be fraudulent in the ordinary sense of the word. It is obviously based on much older material and the practice of ascribing ancient authorship to documents was a com- mon and accepted practice in those days. So why not today? For my purposes I invented Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, leg- endary l'enfant terrible of the modern Qabalisitic movement. Ben Clifford has afforded me the opportunity to soar to outrageous (and hopefully) memorable heights and, when necessary, .st~nd. apart from the silliness to highlight the golden eggs of Qabalistic WIsdom nested therein. This may smack a bit of schizophrenia, and I must admit I have enjoyed being the Rabbi's biographer and critic. I hope"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xxii / INTRODUCTION the reader will also be able to suspend his or her disbelief long enough to join in the fun and learn the fundamentals of the Qabalah. ~ile it ~s certainly not my intention to offend anyone with Rabbi Be~ Cltfford's escapades, it is perhaps inevitable that the for- mat of this book will chafe the sensibilities of those who have for- gotten that spiritual discovery can be a joyous experience and that great truths can be transmitted through the medium of laughter. To each and everyone of you who finish this little book and still feel offended by its content or style, I offer you in advance my sincere and profound apology. I also cautio~ and rebuke all hatemongers and bigots whose dan- gerous pathologI~s and diseased minds would interpret my playful treatment of jewish themes as being anything other than lovingly good-natured. . ~ow that's been said, I think it is time to sit back, suspend your ?Isbeltef ~nd pretend for a few hours that Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford IS real. LIsten carefully to what he has to say. I did-and now I'm proud to say, \"Hell yes! I'm a Chicken Qabalistl\" o WHO WAS RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD? F irst of all, I feel I must apologize to the reader for the unusual format of this book. The raw material came from wildly varied sources and I confess my editing skills were severely challenged. With the exception of The Ten Command-Rants and Commentary, which appeared in the Winter 1989 issue of Gomer magazine, and his 1992 interview in Augury Today magazine, all of Ben Clifford's writings were unpublished and unedited. Several articles were writ- ten as lectures to the imaginary students of his equally imaginary \"Zerubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth,\" and others, like \"Frequently Asked Questions about Chicken Qabalah,\" were com- piled from letters written to students around the world. Arguably, the most unusual section of the book is the unedited screenplay text from his Let's Learn Chicken Qabalah, a never-produced video doc- umentary. Try as I might, I was unable to translate this remarkable work into straight text without losing vitally important information provided by visual gimmicks and queues from the Rabbi's delight- fully twisted imagination. Before July 23, 1997, when his disciples reported him missing, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford was virtually unknown to the world of modern esotericism. The few individuals who knew of the man and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 I CHICKEN QABALAH WHO WAS RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD? I 3 -Lon Milo DuQuette Newport Beach, California his work were violently polarized in their opinions. Most dismissed him as a mad and impudent charlatan. A tiny number, however, pas- sionately embraced his \"Chicken Qabalah,\" and reveled in his irrev- erent and sometimes offensive style, proclaiming it \"dust in the eyes of the profane.\" There is no question about it, Ben Clifford was in many respects an unabashed phony. He was a fraud from the insipid propeller atop his yarmulke to the \"talismanic\" lifts in his shoes. He most certainly was not a bona fide Rabbi. Despite his protestations to the contrary, he held no academic degrees or certificates of rabbinical training. He was not the president of the Zerubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth (Z.I.P.Y.), nor, to the best of my knowledge, has such an orga- nization ever existed. His name was obviously bogus and those that knew of his passion for sweet-and-sour pork will confirm that he probably did not consider himself a practicing Jew. On the other hand, it appears no one was ever harmed by Ben Clifford's chicanery. To my knowledge, he was never accused of any crime more serious than that of bad taste. No one has ever denied that he was extremely well-read, and that some time in his nebulous past he most certainly achieved deep and profound levels of spiritual illumination. Be that as it may, I did not write this book as a defense of this colorful eccentric, but to introduce the golden treasures of the man's thoughts to a broader audience. I'm sure it will be apparent to the reader who is already well versed on the subject, that Ben Clifford's teachings are far from an exhausting exposition of the myriad (sometimes conflicting) doc- trines of the Qabalah. For example, he omits altogether any discus- sion of the Qliphoth or the false Sephirah Daath. He also chose to adhere exclusively to the venerable, yet simplistic, doctrine of a four- part division of the soul, ignoring (at least in print) the more com- plex theories which posit a greater Neshamah subdivided into Neshamah-Chiah- Yechidah.! However, I caution the adept reader against jumping to the con- clusion that Ben Clifford's teachings in any way \"dumbs-down\" the Qabalah. He has, in my opinion, accomplished the nearly impossible task of distilling to its essence one of the most (if not the most) com- plex spiritual sciences in the world. He offers the new student the opportunity to grasp the big Qabalistic picture before he o~ she, feels obliged to start (as the Rabbi wrote) \"counting the nostril halr~ of God.\" At the same time, his unpretentious approach to the subject serves to remind the veteran Qabalist (who perhaps has been count- ing the nostril hairs of God for many years) that there is a big Qabalistic picture. . The last thirty years have witnessed a proliferation of interest III the occult and all aspects of the Western mystery tradition. There is no argument among the well-informed that the Hebrew Qabalah throbs at the very heart of this tradition, sometimes as the source, sometimes as the transmitter of the wisdom of the ages. To this new generation of seekers, some of whom may be destined. to plum~ the deepest mysteries of the Qabalah, and others who will be satisfied just to scratch the surface, I am honored to present The Chicken Q!lbalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Cliffird."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 FREQ1JENTLY ASKED Q1JESTIONS ABOUT CHICKEN Oh-BALAH Introduced by Lon Milo DuQuette \"U7e are Qabalists not to prove the Bible is holy- we are Qabalists because everything is holy. -RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD W ith out doubt, the first question people asked Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford concerned his choice of the word \"Chicken\" to describe his brand of Qabalistic study and practice.

Then, shortly before returning the last draft of the manuscript to my publisher, I received a telephone call from one of the Rabbi's students living in New York City.

It is...it is...\" The poor man's face turned bright red and his whole body began to shake as he searched his mind for a word fowl [sic] enough to describe my work. \"It is-it is-Chicken! Chicken Kahb-bah- 'law!\" It was instantly obvious to everyone in the room that he was painfully embarrassed at the ill-chosen and infantile words that blurted mindlessly out of his mouth. People start- ed to chuckle. He then became so flustered that he spat upon the floor and said, \"You and your teachings merit only spit! Spit!\" and then he stormed out of the hall. As I am vowed to interpret every phenomenon as a direct communication from God to my soul, I recognized this awful slobbering man as an angel of the Lord, sent to reveal to me the name of the spiritual science that would forever cling to my name. That night in meditation I examined his message Qabalistically. The Hebrew word for phlegm or spittle is M~~ (KICh), and the word for merit is m (NE). To my great joy, the phrase \"merit spit,\" M~~ M~, enumerates! to the number 93, one of the holiest of numbers. Number 93 relates not only to the divine concepts of Love and Will, but also to the great secret Word by which we triumph over death. I then looked down at my notes to discover that the very same letters arranged in the very same order rendered in English characters the word T'T~ : m (ChI KEN). [ cannot say that I actually believe the above story. It might have some basis in fact, but, like most of the Rabbi's stories, it is probably pure fiction (or as he would say, \"a Holy Whopper\"). As we will soon see, however, the lies of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford can contain some very great truths. The list of questions and answers, below, was not compiled by Ben Clifford. I compiled it with the kind help of his secretary and \"magical son,\" Gizmo Ben Lamed, from nearly 6 years of the Rabbi's personal correspondence with disciples and detractors. What is Chicken Qabalah? Chicken Qabalah is the deceptively self-effacing term given to those aspects of the Holy Hebrew Qabalah that are of practical value to practitioners of the Western Hermetic spiritual tradition. While giv- ing the most profound respect to individuals and institutions that teach the rich parochial traditions of speculative Qabalah, Chicken Qabalists, like students of Zen, focus pragmatically on the mind- transcending techniques of the art. Who are Chicken Qabalists? Anybody can be a Chicken Qabalist, but at this point in history most are students of Tarot, Psychology, Astrology, Ceremonial Magick, Rosicrucianism, Alchemy, Mystic Freemasonry, or Witchcraft.\" Is Chicken Qabalah real Qabalah? Hell yes! Don't worry about it, and don't let anyone tell you other- wise. So-called orthodox Qabalahs are only other people's Chicken Qabalahs that have been around for a long time. Is there a correct way to spell the word Qabalah? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. Cabala, Kabbalah, Quabbbalah, Caqubabalalah- They're all wrong!

Is it hard to become a Chicken Qabalist? Hell no! Don't worry about it. But, if you feel you need some exter- nal validation, sign this, cut it out and put it in your wallet. No need to send in an application or pay any dues. If the omniscient Deity really exists, It will surely recognize YOut bold act of spiritual audacity. Zerrubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth Z.I.P.Y. This is to certify that wallows guiltlessly in the nonsectarian freedom of thought exemplified in the Mystical Science of the Chicken Qabbalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford and because of that act of intelligence and good taste is entitled to the honor and respect of all self-assured and unpretentious seekers of truth everywhere, and forever is entitled to bear the august title of CHICKEN QABALIST \"Hell no! I don't worry about it!\" Figure 1. Wallet card for the Chicken Qabalist. There! You're a full-fledged Chicken Qabalist. Now, the first thing you need to learn is that everyone's Qabalah is uniquely their own. Your Qabalah is not my Qabalah or anyone else's. A personal Qabalah is placed in your hands the moment you take up the study. It's alive, and grows upon what you feed it. The more you learn, the more you use. No two students study or work the same. For example: I know people who have studied most, if not all, of the classic texts. They know their Hebrew backward and forward, and a whole poop-load of the traditional correspondences. They can twist and abuse numbers and letters all night long and send you out' the door screaming with their nonstop raving. They can manipulate your address and phone number to prove you're the antichrist, and your real name is Rumplestiltskin. However, all that doesn't neces- sarily mean they are using that knowledge to do anything other than bore their friends to death. On the other hand, you might be inclined to learn and use only one or two Qabalistic tricks of the trade. That's fine. Used everyday with tenacity and skill, even the most elementary exercises can drive you crazy just as fast as the complex and exotic operations-maybe faster! Don't worry about it! Do I need to be Jewish? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't need to be born anything, believe anything, or belong to any reli- gion, cult, order, or political party. You don't need to believe in the Hebrew God, or Moses, or the Great Goddess, or Jesus, or L. Ron Hubbard, or Mohammed, or any other savior, prophet, or salesper- son. You don't even need a faithful heart or an open mind. The brain-warping power of Qabalistic thought will soon make all those things irrelevant. Will I need to learn the Hebrew language? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't have to learn to speak Hebrew. But you will have to recognize and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 / CHICKEN Q;'\\BALAH F A QS ABO U T CHI C KEN QA B A L A H / 11 be able to write the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. You will also have to know the meanings and the numerical values of each Hebrew lener.? There is no escaping this part of your education. Eventually, as you study and work with the alphabet, you will become familiar with various Hebrew words that are important to the system. Soon, if your studies take you in that direction, you will be able to recognize these words in the original Hebrew texts. This skill is very impressive to friends and relatives who always thought you were stupid and unspiritual. Best of all, it will make them feel guilty and have agonizing doubts about their own religious beliefs because they can't read their own scriptures in the original tongue. Go ahead. Rub it in! Being a Chicken Qabalist is fun! WOn't I be intimidated by serious Jewish Qabalists and others who speak Hebrew? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. The first liberating secret Chicken Qabalists learn is that (as far as the Qabalah is concerned) there is no such thing as correct Hebrew pronunciation'> Yep! That's right. No matter how you pronounce the various words in the system, some snob is sure to pop up (especially in public) and correct you. Remember that Hebrew, as a spoken language is rela- tively young. Sure, there are those who speak Yiddish, or ]udezmo, Sephardic, or Ashkenazic, and a score of other regional and ethnic dialects. There are correct ways to pronounce these dialects, but nobody, I repeat, nobody knows for sure what the sacred language of the ancient Hebrews sounded like, or even if it was spoken at all! Pronunciation has less than nothing to do with the study and practi- cal spiritual applications of the Qabalah. Be proud of the fact that you are informed and honest enough to admit you are not sure how the words are pronounced and, what's more, you don't even care. Such crass indifference is unbearable to those who would dare belittle the work of the Chicken Qabalist. That being said, it's always a good idea to remember: Rabbi Lamed's HelpfUl Hint Number 1: Never correct other Qabalists' pronunciation of Hebrew words no matter how silly it sounds. First of all, they might be right. Secondly, your silence will make them think you are a highly intelli- gent person because you agree with them. Rabbi Lamed's HelpfUl Hint Number 2: Better still, just don't talk with other Qabalists. I hear the Qabalah is based on the Bible. Do I have to believe in the Bible? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't have to believe in anything. If the Bible leaves a bad taste in your mouth, welcome to the club. But before you throw old King James out the window, I'd like to point out that the Bible is holy-but so are the phonebook, Webster's Dictionary, Robert's Rules of Order and the menu at McDonalds. As you will learn from the Ten Cornmand-Rants.t everything is holy and anything is capable of being the vehicle of divine revelation. Key books of the Bible, how- ever, were written by Qabalists for Qabalists and so should be of par- ticular interest to us. I know, you're probably not thrilled about Bible study. Perhaps like me you've had unpleasant experiences with people who are con- vinced that the Bible teaches the most ridiculous and monstrous things. Well, now you can tell all those spiritual bullies who tried to terrorize you with the eternal agonies of hell that they can just go there. I'm going to share a little secret with you that only Chicken Qabalists (and a few musicians) have the courage and wit to handle: The people who wrote the Qabalistic books of the Bible never intended for them to be readby the public. There! I've said it. I feel so much better. Be honest with yourself. Deep in your heart, you've always known it was true, haven't you?"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 / CHICKEN Q!\\BALAH How many times have you tried to wade into Genesis or Ezekiel, and finally just gave up and said, \"What the hell are these guys talking about?\" Don't feel bad. You weren't meant to know what they're talk- ing about-not unless you held vital interpretive keys. I know that sounds snobby and elitist, but it's the truth. These texts were crafted by mystics possessed of profound understanding of the universe and the mysteries of human existence. At a time when writing was reserved for priests and royalty, they used poetry and parables to express thoughts that everyday language could not accommodate. They assembled the phrases with great art from indi- vidual words that conveyed an even deeper level of truth; and finally, each word was made up of unique symbolic letters, each of which revealed yet another story-a story so profound and abstract it could only be told and understood in the pure language of numbers and mathematics. These sages were full-time holy guys. They wrote this stuff for other full-time holy guys, and the tiny segment of every generation who would be equipped with the intelligence, the spiritual drive (and leisure time) necessary to embark upon a lifelong quest for enlight- enment. I assure you, these ancient mystics would have produced a radically different body of work had they in their wildest nightmares imagined that in some future dark age their secret coded scriptures would be seized by half-witted and sadistic European cannibals and interpreted literally, like some grotesque and racist history book. Will the study of the Qabalah make me a better person? No! You'll have to do that yourself 2 THE TEN COMMAND-RANTS Introduced by Lon Milo DuQuette Don't worry if none of this makes any sense to you right now. It is enough to remember that Realization of One is the second-to-last goal of all Q!lbalists. Thefinal goal is to attain the consciousness of Nothing. -RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD R abbi Ben Clifford claimed that in the wint~r of 1989 he m.ad~ a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he climbed Mount Sinai to, as he put it, \"touch base and get further clarification\" on several matters pertaining to scripture. On the summit, the Supreme Deity allegedly appeared to him in the form of a rotating tongue sandwich that lectured Ben Clifford for about six minutes. To quote the Rabbi: The Lord's lustrous lingua lashed from the luminous laser-like lights that licked the length of the lush and lonely landscape. Later, I laughed like a lunatic as I lay lifelessly limp and lin- gered upon the lilt of the last littlest letter of the Laws and the laudable lessons I so lately learned. Of course this story is a complete fabrication. To my knowledge, Ben Clifford never visited Israel, and in 1989 would have been physically unfit to climb any mountain. In fact, I have spoken to several of his early students, who informed me that in the winter of 1989 the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14 / CHICKEN Q!\\BALAH Rabbi was hospitalized in New York City after suffering an emotion- al breakdown on the observation deck of the Empire State Building after becoming violently ill at the Carnegie Deli. Be that as it may, the fact remains that in late 1989 Ben Clifford did indeed publish a short treatise on the nature of the creation and the underlying theory of Qabalistic study. These \"Ten Command- Rants,\" as he called them, are a work of unquestioned genius. They are perhaps the most concise description of the nature of reality ever penned, reducing complex and inscrutable concepts to their essence. Their publication in the prestigious Qabalah magazine, Gomer, result- ed in Rabbi Ben Clifford's overnight transformation from crazy-old- burned-out lunatic to crazy-old-burned-out-lunatic holy man. I consider his subsequent commentaries on the Ten Command- Rants the best introduction to the Qabalah ever written. They con- tinue to be, for me, a perpetual reminder of why I am on the great Qabalistic adventure. I strongly advise the student to refer to them often throughout the years of his or her mystical career. The Ten Command-Rants COMMENTARIES ON THE TEN COMMAND-RANTS ]firs! QIommana- 3R,m! All is One. This statement is hardly a veil-rending revelation to anyone who has dabbled even slightly with abstract thought. It's easy to imagine everything in the universe lumped together into one big something beyond which there is nothing. But it's the concept of nothing that sends our primate minds into a tailspin. Now, the very young Chicken Qabalist might be tempted to think of this divine nothing- ness as kind of a negative \"enO\" from which the \"One\" somehow popped into being as if from behind a mysterious looking-glass. But, as the Second Command-Rant will demonstrate, \"nothing\" is \"some- thing else\" altogether. ~Â£tona QIommana- 3Ran! The First Command-Rant is a lie. All is Nothing. Astronomers and physicists tell us there is more nothing in the uni- verse than anything else.

There is infinitely more nothing in an atom than protons and electrons. There is more nothing in our bodies than anything else. We are full of tubes and pockets and sacs and bladders and cavities and chambers and openings and voids. Every cell in your body is mostly nothing. When a cell starts to divide to produce more cells, it first folds in on itself to create more precious nothing to work with. Even your brain grew out of the nothingness of this embryonic internal disappearing act. Physicists cannot even say with any certainty that matter, as most people think of it, exists at all. The components of atoms (protons, neutrons, electrons, quarks, charm, etc.) are not matter. They are ten- dencies. (Tell that to your head the next time you slam it getting into your carl) Physicists and mystics are now using the same vocabulary, and it is only a matter of time before our learned men and women of science will announce clearly what Qabalists have been saying cryp- tically for centuries. Elements of creation as we know them-minerals and metals, animals and people, planets and stars, light and energy-are merely the husks of an invisible universal force that sustains the entire cos- mos. We're like dead skin cells that have flaked off from the body of the unmanifest Super-Being. This force-this nothingness, is better than reality. It is undilured, unlimited potentiality! It is the ultimate reality, and the nature of that reality is pure consciousness. The first thing that attracted me to the Qabalah as a young Chicken Qabalist (hatchling) was the concept that everything pro- ceeded out of this \"Nothing.\" That made Nothing the ultimate cre- ator, not the Elohim.! or Jehovah, or any of the other ill-tempered bullies of the Old Testament. I liked the idea of brooding and inscrutable Nothing behind everything in the universe. You can think about the Elohim creating stuff like crazy; you can think about YHVH Elohim- blowing life into Adam's nose; you can even think about a sneaky stinky cloud killing the first-born babies in ancient Egypt; but you can't think about Nothing! Anything you can think about -anything you can capture and hold in your mind's eye-is automatically disqualified from infinityhood and can't possi- bly be the ultimate Deity. Qabalistic tradition informs us that everything proceeded from rhe Great One, and the Great One proceeded from a very special kind of Nothing-actually three very special kinds of Nothing. Beginning Chicken Qabalists need not spend a great deal of time try- ing to grasp this concept because, first, it can't be understood, and second, if you did understand it, there would no longer be a ne:d ~or you to study anything. However, as you .approa~h t~e meditative summit of your career as a Chicken Qabahst, the irrational myster. y of the three kinds of Nothing will increasingly absorb you. For this reason I offer the following. The first kind of Nothing is called Ain tN. 3 This Nothing is really nothing-not even the concept of no-thing (i.:., the a~sen~~ of anything). Now, if Ain just sat around nowhere doing nothing It.s a sure bet that nothing was going to get done. However, something happened to make Ain actually become Nothing (maybe bec~use it was Nothing all along and just had to wake up to the fact). This new, defined Nothing the Qabalists call Limitless Nothing, or Ain Soph =\"1'0 tN. The third kind of Nothing is a hybr,id A.in Soph c~lled Ain Soph Aur, \"N =\"1'0 tN, Limitless Light. I vie,,:, It as.the light bulb that goes off in the vastness of Ain Soph when It realizes the p~rfe~t Notness of its Nothingness! Nothing is Nod This double negative IS tantamount to saying \"Something is!\" and sets the stage for the first Positive in the universe-the concept of One. 4 Don't worry if none of this makes any sense to you right now. It is enough to remember that realization of \"One\" is the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists. The final goal is to attain the consciousness of \"Nothing.\" [~tra QIommana- 3Rant There really isn't a creation, time or space, Heaven or Earth . . . Get used to it.

Get real! We are all sleepwalkers stumbling blind, deaf, and numb through a life we could never understand even if we could see, hear, feel, or smell like Superman. It is perfectly natural for you to ask, \"Why is there evil in the world?\" or \"Why do bad things happen to good people?\" but stop Hattering yourself You're never going to find an answer to those ques- tions by gathering information with your senses and attempting to process that information with your brain. 1Jfifth arnmmano-l\\ant This defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome. Caution: Most people will be happier if they never try to overcome this defect. That is why most people in the world find it so easy to believe the most outrageous religious concepts without batting an eyelash.

This is done by Qabalistic study and thought. ~txth arommano-l\\ant In order to overcome our defective powers of perception we must be willing to abuse them until they break.

Isn't Jehovah God? Didn't Jehovah create Heaven and Earth? Hell no! Elohim did, and Elohim is a very peculiar word -RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD T he Qabalah is not a book. There are, however many texts which form the literary foundation of Qabalistic study. A rather extensive bibliography can be found at the end of this book. Of primary interest to fledgling Chicken Qabalists is the Sepher Yetzirah or Book of Formation. This work is ascribed to the patriarch Abraham (but, to quote Rabbi Ben Clifford, \"That's a crock!\"). Nevertheless, the Sepher Yetzirah is very old-perhaps the oldest philosophical treatise written in Hebrew. I There are three important features that make the Sepher Yetzirah particularly attractive to the lazy and pretentious. First of all (and most importantly) it is very short and relatively easy to understand. Second, it introduces us to the concept of the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations that emerge from the primal unity. In later Qabalistic lit- erature the concept of the 10 Sephiroth develops into the Tree of Life, a very helpful schematic, especially for Chicken Qabalists.s Third, it tells the simple story of how Deity created the Hebrew alphabet then used the letters to form the words that brought the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"26 / CHICKEN QABALAH universe into being. This concept may sound a little silly, but this silliness is the foundation of the Qabalistic worldview and meditative exercises that will eventually obsess the diligent student. Now, I am putting you on your honor to obtain at least one of the classic translations of the Sepher Yetzirah and put it in a conspic- uous spot on your bookshelf. If you are a serious student you will most certainly wish to read it. But I warn you, even the best transla- tions will appear very strange-full of tiresome and seemingly irrele- vant ramblings. I confess that as a young student, I lamented the fact that, even though the Sepher Yetzirah was short, all the really useful information was buried under piles of archaic language and stupid- sounding redundancies. Imagine my great joy when I was introduced to Ben Clifford's marvelous and practical \"translation.\" Naturally, like all of the Rabbi's works, the text is surrounded by controversy. Ben Clifford swore to his students this version of the Sepher Yetzirah was a faithful translation of the most ancient and authoritative manuscript available, but there is no doubt that this is another one of his pathetic and transparent lies. The work is obvi- ously a modern counterfeit. (The text even carelessly makes refer- ences to pizza and the theme music from the television game show \"Jeopardy.\") One of the Rabbi's students, who asked to remain anonymous, told me he believed the Rabbi himself concocted the \"translation\" in 1983 while recovering from a bout of Montezuma's revenge in a motel room in Ensenada, Mexico. Be that as it may, like his Ten Command-Rants, Ben Clifford's treatment of the Sepher Yetzirah cuts straight to the heart of what Chicken Qabalists need to learn first. I do not hesitate to reprint the entire text, including his provocative introduction written to the stu- dents of his imaginary institute.

And created the Elohim Adam in the image of Elohim creat- ed they them, male and female created they them.\" Surprised? So was everyone who had their hearts set on God not having a vagina and everyone who believed that Adam was an his- torical character, like General Custer, and not just a name for the human race. They were so upset when they discovered that in the beginning the Dual-Gendered Deity created Heaven and Earth that they made sure that Elohim and innumerable other special names would be translated \"God\" or \"Lord\" or \"Lord God\" or other such ambiguous masculine-sounding names.> Besides this little titbit, verse 1 leaves us in the dark concerning what Heaven is, what Earth is, or how the Elohim went about creat- ing these things. Verse 2 is even worse: And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters. If Earth was void and formless, where was all this water coming from? If the author was trying to be inscrutable, he sure did a damned good job of it. Verse 3 finally gives us something we can dig our teeth into: And the Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light. The key word here is \"said.\" That's how everything was created-the Elohim talked everything into exisrence.v The Elohim said it, and it was so. Obviously words are very important in the grand creation sce- nario. A word is a vibration, and vibration creates and sustains the universe. The atomic weight of the chemical elements is just another way of measuring their vibration. Molecules hold themselves togeth- er and bond with other molecules by the \"glue\" of their compatible vibrations. That's what is meant by the term \"the creative Logos, or Word.\" That's what John? was talking about when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" Duh! And what, my sleepy students, are words made up of? Letters! Our Hebrew alphabet (and what other alphabet would the Elohim dare use?) is made up of 22 sacred letters, and the story of their ere- arion is not found in the Bible, but in a mysterious little masterpiece called the Sepher Yetzirah: The Book of Formation. Several years ago, I personally had the extraordinary goo~ for- tune of being allowed to purchase the earliest known manuscript of this sacred work from a mysterious street vendor just outside of Hussan's Cantina in Ensenada, Mexico. I painstakingly translated it by carefully copying the Hebrew characters into my personal com- puter using the standard Hebrew fonts included in my wo~d pro- cessing program. When I finished, I simply selected the enure text and globally changed the font to Times New R~~an. ~o my amaze- ment it translated exactly as you see it.

Formed by the breath of Air, It fixed them on five places in the mouth: the Throat, the Palate, the Tongue, the Teeth, and the Lips. The Deity divided the 22 letters into three divisions: Three Mothers or Fundamental Letters, Seven Doubles, and Twelve Simple Consonants. THE THREE MOTHERS Three are the Fundamental Letters.

Even the laziest Chicken Qabalist needs to learn the Hebrew alphabet and at least some of its tradi- tional correspondences. I As Rabbi Ben Clifford said in \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" this doesn't mean that you will have to learn, speak, or read the Hebrew language. In fact, once you have learned the Hebrew alphabet and its Qabalistic and numerical secrets, you will most likely spend a lot of time examining English words and let- ters using their Hebrew equivalents. Another thing that is absolutely necessary for your study is a small basic library of reference works. You don't have to have these books right now, but you will want them very soon. Of course you will collect more books as you descend into Qabalistic madness, but these texts (and this book, of course) will be enough to get you on the road: Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser 1990);"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"38 / CHICKEN QABALAH THE HEBREW ALPHABET / 39 David Godwin, Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1994); Ehud Ben Yehuda, Ben- Yehuda's Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew- English Dictionary (New York: Pocket Books, 1991). We must remember that Ben Clifford wrote this little twenty-five page essay simply to help beginning students remember how to rec- ognize and correctly draw each Hebrew letter. I believe he succeeded admirably in doing this. Several of his descriptions evoke bizarre and unforgettable images: \"Tau looks like a Resh holding a dead dolphin by the tail,\" or \"Lamed looks like a snake that has swallowed a brick and is now having second thoughts.\" As a purely Qabalistic work, however, this essay is far from com- prehensive. His comments on the letters are limited primarily to basic definitions of the letters. Occasionally he muses briefly about how the primitive meanings may be applied to cosmic, psychologi- cal, or sexual principles, but for the most part, he seems satisfied to offer us simply an appetizer to further food for thought. The stunning exception is found in his comments on the letter Yod. I strongly urge the reader to carefully read and re-read that section. In 210 words, Ben Clifford casually reveals the supreme symbolic secret of creation by drawing our attention to that most mysterious of natural numbers known to mathematicians as the Greek letter Phi, and to architects as the Golden Mean or Golden Section. This number, or ratio (1.6180339887499), like the irrational Figure 6. Yael, the Golden Mean, Yin- Ytmg. number Pi, seems to issue from, and set the pattern for, the basic ..rructure of the entire cosmos. But, unlike other abstract numbers, till' pattern set by Phi is revealed naturally and universally in all liv- lllg things and all things that grow and develop in stages. One of the most striking examples of this pattern of growth can found in the ~hl'll of the nautilus, which, when cross-sectioned, reveals a breath- ,.,king repeating pattern of what looks like extended Hebrew Yods or Fllglish letter Gs. On a grander scale, it can be found in the forma- lion of the great spiral nebulae. This primal pattern of patterns is, lndeed, the \"G\" signature of the \"Great Architect of the Universe,\" the name by which Freemasons refer to Deity. As far as I know, Ben I :Iifford is the first Qabalist (or alleged Qabalist) to make this pro- II lund and fundamental connection. I suppose inevitably there will be those who view as crude and ollensive Ben Clifford's sexual allusions to Hebrew letters and other clements of Qabalistic study. Admittedly, at first glance it does appear I hat he places an inordinate emphasis on phalluses and vaginas, wombs and sperm, and such. As he is no longer here to defend him- self, I feel I must say a few words on the Rabbi's behalf. For the last two thousand years there has been a concerted effort hy those who would guide the spiritual life of Western Civilization, 10 divorce human life from nature (on one end of the scale) and from I iod on the other. We are taught that we are superior to other living things because we were created in the image of the Deity and can do what we damn well please with the environment and the creatures .iround us. At the same time, we are told that the Deity is outside of lis-that we stand eternally separated from It because of an ambigu- ous act of disobedience committed by our mythological ancestors- that we are cursed by the simple act of being born. Ben Clifford's 7th, Hrh, and 9th Command-Rants cleanly expose this spiritual schizo- phrenia as a cruel and unwholesome fraud. Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"40 / CHICKEN Qt..BALAH Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth. Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of every- thing in Heaven and Earth. Nothing can be separated from anything else, including all aspects of the human condition. To discuss sexual matters within a religious context is as proper as discussing matters of scripture, or mathemat- ics, or physics. Since a great deal of our time is already spent think- ing about sex, it is only logical that a significant part of our medita- tions on any subject should be dominated by the universal truths inherent in sexual imagery. Ben Clifford was fond of misquoting Freud and often told his students, \"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. .. and sometimes it is the supreme creative force of the universe.\" I applaud Ben Clifford's healthy attitude and casual candor. Furthermore, I can say with some small measure of authority that much of what he has to say in this area reveals the most profound level of understanding. I advise the serious student to ponder his words carefully.

Hell no! God's a Chicken Qabalist and doesn't worry about it. Do you actually think there is a white-bearded giant in the clouds who created the universe and everything in it by belching out nouns and verbs right out of some celestial edition of Ben-Yehuda's Hebrew dictionary? I don't think so. The creative fiat, the language of the Deity, is not one of grunts and gurgles and hisses and sighs. It is a lan- guage of numbers. Numbers do all the work. What distinguishes the Hebrew alphabet is not its pronunciation or its words and grammar, but its intimate relationship with numbers. If God \"said\" anything in the beginning, it was most likely, \"Let there be 3.\" That's all that needed to be said because, as we learned in the Sepher Yetzirah, the 3 dimensions then just took off on their own and extended from the central point to instantly form 7 and 12 spatial coordinates-a tight little 22-piece toolbox of creation. Let's start our brief study of the Hebrew alphabet by first observ- ing that the 22 letters are divided into 3 categories: 3 Mother letters, 7 Double letters, and 12 Simple letters. 3-7-12.

A house is fundamental- ly a container, but it is also a shelter, a sanctuary, and a resting place, and most importantly, a place to exist. Beth is the funda- mental structure of the universe, a container of existence, a recep- tacle of life, an atom, a living cell, a body. Astrologers divide the Heavens into twelve \"houses.\" Family bloodlines and households are also considered \"houses,\" such as the House of David or the House of Frankenstein.

It has one long diagonal bar that looks like a banana separating two small Yods. The Yod at the top right is connected to the banana at midpoint by a thin line (a Yod on a stick). The Yod at the bottom left is flat- tened at the bottom like a foot and is connected to the banana underneath its left shoulder. Aleph is spelled ='l~N (ALP). The three letters enumerate to 111 (or using Peh Final 831) and mean \"ox.\" In ancient cultures, the ox that pulled the furrowing plough was a supreme symbol of the fertilizing force of creation. Aleph is a letter of breath and the closest thing the Hebrew alphabet has to a vowel. As the plough of the ox penetrates and aerates the soil, so the breath of life pen- etrates and vivifies you and me. Oh hell! I'll come out and say it-the Air of Aleph is more than just the firmament of atmos- phere surrounding Earth-it is the Life-Force itself, the Prana of the Hindus, the active ingredient that makes the Holy Spirit holy).

A camel is the \"ship of the desert,\" a vehicle of lIfe and commerce, capable of crossing the vast abyss of sand. The Path of Gimel on the Tree of Life also crosses the Abyss and joins Kether to Tiphareth. In Aramaic (the language allegedly spoken by Jesus) the word camel and the word rope are spelled exactly the same, \"gamla.\" I wasn't there, so I can't say for sure, but I'll bet in Matthew 19:24 Jesus says, \"It is easier for a rope (not camel) to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Duh!

Nails and pins are sharp, pointy things that join two objects together by means of penetration. By its very shape, it rep- resents the phallus. This implies union (yoga), and union with God is the goal of all mystics, especially Chicken Qabalists. The process is theoretically simple. Find the proper Vau and you can nail yourself to God!

Heh also means the identification of a star, as for navigation or astrology. Its shape introduces the concept of openings-a small open- ing on the left and a large opening from below.

A fence encloses an area and sets it apart from the surrounding area. It is a wall, a hedge, a membrane, a shell, a womb, a crust, a fortress, a citadel.

A sword is also an instrument of division, separating one thing from another (like your enemy's head from his shoul- ders), and of discretion and analysis, separating one idea from another.

Yod is a flame. Blow upon it and you create all the other letters of the alphabet. Yod is my favorite Hebrew letter because it is so simple. It is the perfect pattern of primal creation-a point extending to become the whirling motion. It is Phi, the seed of the Golden Spiral; the mystic \"G\" in your grandfather's Masonic ring; the Yin and Yang; the human embryo; the blueprint of the ram's horn and the nautilus; the swirling cream in your coffee, and the billowing dynamics of smoke and air and water. It sets the pattern for our fingerprints, our DNA and the shape of great galaxies. It is the primal male- Shiva divine fire that plunges joyously into the female-Shakti ocean of divine water. Yod is spelled ,or (YVD) [which is not a public health ques- tion].

We are snakes with arms and legs, and this serpent energy is the key to our divine birthright. Like a snake swallowing its tail, there is truly no end to the mystery of the serpent. The one that tempted Eve is the same one that Moses elevated on a pole, and the same one that Jesus told us to be as \"wise as.\" It is also interesting to note that the ancients were aware that individual sperm cells look like tiny snakes with giant (lion-like) heads.

Up until this verse, the single word C~M~N (Elohirn') was used in Genesis to designate the creator God. In other words, the Deity who created human beings (Adam) by performing CPR on a dirt statue, was a new kind of Elohim, or probably more likely, a specific aspect of Elohim-a [ebouah- Elohim. Why are pious Jews so afraid to pronounce rnl\"i~ and Christians say the word \"Jehovah\" with such impunity? The answer is simple. Pious Jews are taught to respect the author or authors of the Pentateuch-mystics who knew that l\"i' l\"i ~ is not really a name at all, but a formula that reveals the basic mechanics of creation and human existence. Christians, on the other hand, historically and by tradi- tion, are encouraged to look no deeper into scripture than the textu- al narrative, and seem quite satisfied to relegate the magnificent forces of creation to an ill-tempered and fickle mountain-thunder goblin named Jehovah. Ironically, the Germans gave us the pronunciation Je-ho-vah. It's not a bad try. As we all know, there are no vowels in Hebrew. The lit- tle dots and lines (dageshes or points) we see placed over and under the letters of Hebrew words to give clues to pronunciation are a very new innovation to the language. The original texts did not have these points, and so each letter of a word could be pronounced in many different ways. A simple method to examine just one of the pronunciation choices available is to add a long English vowel sound (A, E, I, 0, U) after any given letter. Let's take the letter \"B\" or Beth ~ in Hebrew. Beth can sound like \"bay,\" or \"bee,\" or \"by,\" or \"bow,\" or \"boo.\" The Table 2.

Truly, there is no end to the possi- ble pronunciations of mM~. Tradition informs us that each year on the tenth day of Tisri (October 10), the Day of Atonement, the High Priest ofIsrael made three trips into the Most Holy Place of the Great Temple and sprin- kled the Ark of the Covenant with blood. Around his leg was tied a long braided rope. The other end of the rope was held by friends of the High Priest who were stationed well outside of the veiled confines of the Most Holy Place. On his third visit to the Most Holy Place, while a multitude of the faithful stood outside the temple and made a lot of noise, the High Priest placed his hands directly upon the Ark and uttered the Ineffable Name as the fiery Deity revealed Itself in cloud and lightning above the lid (\"Mercy Seat\") of the Ark. Sounds like a simple ritual, doesn't it? It was not unlike those practiced by Egyptian and Babylonian priests who once or twice a year penetrated their God's sanctum sanctorum, and offered prayers and oblations before sacred statues or other holy objects. What made th~s cere~ony a little different, however, had to do with that rope the HIgh Pnest had tied around his leg.

Ha- Wah-Ee!\" Perhaps the God of cowboys is called Gee-Hah! Wah-Hoo! reason-a reason that, while perhaps not immediately apparent, had everything to do with the correct pronunciation of M'M~. The rope was needed because every once in a while, at the climax of this supreme ceremony, the High Priest exploded! Not only that, after the poor fellow's spectacular departure, the Holy of Holies filled with so much smoke and fire that it became too dangerous to enter, and the barbecued remains of the Priest had to be dragged from the chamber by the rope.3 The next year a new High Priest would have to give it another try. In order for us to understand these strange circumstances and the true pronunciation of the Ineffable Name, it will be necessary for me to talk briefly about the Ark of the Covenant. First of all, we have to remember that the warring people of Old Testament times were a very superstitious lot. They carried their gods into battle with them in the form of statues, or animals, or other talis- manic objects, such as meteorites, or monumental cheeses.t If one side happened to win a battle, their god was considered superior to the god of the loosing side. Very often the first thing the vanquished army would do after regrouping was to steal the god of the winners and put it to work for them. We read in First Samuel this happened to the Ark of the Covenant. The Philistines stole it, but later returned it when they discovered it kept killing anyone who tried to move it. Good riddance! The Ark was a rectangular box that contained the magic goodies from the exodus: Aaron's rod> that performed all those miracles in Egypt; a pot of manna, the heavenly food that sprang up like mush- rooms in the morning dew and fed the children of the exodus in the wilderness; a pan of liquid referred to as anointing oil, and most importantly, the stone tablets of the Law. In Exodus chapter 25, \"'M~ gave very specific directions how the Ark was to be constructed: And they shall make an ark of shittim wood, two-and-a-half cubits long, and a cubit-and-a-half broad, and a cubit-and-a- half high. 6 And you shall overlay it withpure gold, withoutand"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"76 / CHICKEN Q;\\BALAH THE INEFFABLE NAME OF GOD! 77 within shall you overlay it, and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about. Andyou shall cast four rings of goldfor it, and put them in thefour corners thereof and two rings on the other side of it. And you shall make poles ofshittim wood, and overlay them withgold And you shall put the poles into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall never be taken out of them. And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you. And you shall make a mercy seat? of pure gold, two-and-a-half cubits long, and a cubit-and-a-half broad 8 And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of cast work shall you make them, on the two sides of the mercy seat. And make one cherub on the one side, and the other cherub on the other side of the mercy seat; thus you shall make two cherubim on the two sides thereof And the cherubim shall spread forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seal shall the faces of the cherubim be. And you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the arkyou shall put the testimony that I shall give you. And there I will meet you, and I will commune with youfrom above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will command you concerning the children of Israel. The Ark was a lethal weapon and the Israelites treated it like one. They kept it wrapped in cloth and leather, and the men who carried it had to wear special clothes and special shoes. That didn't always help. The. Bible tells us that people who accidentally touched or got too near the Ark were struck by lightning or consumed by flashes of fire. The Great Temple of Solomon appears to have been built not so much as a house of worship, but as a prison for the dangerous and unpredictable Ark. The Holy of Holies where the Ark rested was built like a containment chamber, a perfect cube, thirty feet long, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet high. The floor, walls, and ceiling were lined with pure gold, weighing an estimated 45,000 pounds, and riveted in place with golden nails. Sometimes the Ark would belch out so much smoke that the Priests of the Temple were driven completely out of the building and could not perform their routine duties.? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that a wooden box with a double lining of gold and closed with a slab of gold, containing pots ()f mysterious substances, heavy plates and rods submerged in a pan of liquid, was in all likelihood a gigantic and highly unstable battery. The two cherubim on the lid served as the anode and cathode, and a spark or \"arc\" (the flaming presence of God) jumped madly between the tips of the two highly conductive golden wings. I can hear you laughing, dear students, but I must remind you that viable batteries have been found in Egyptian tombs of this peri- od and before.l\" I am confident if you review the biblical description of the Ark, and its deadly behavior, you will find nothing inconsis- tent with the performance of such a primitive electrical device. Such a spectacular and deadly lightshow would most certainly have been an awful spectacle of terror, and a very useful tool if one wanted to keep the troops in line during a 40-year campout. The High Priest must have been a pretty brave fellow to enter that room and play electrical Russian roulette with \"Ole Sparky.\" As he lay both hands upon that terrible device, his flesh would divert the current that normally arced between the Cherubic wings and for one spectacular moment the power ofn,n\" literally dwelt in his contort- ing body. If he survived the event, he was most likely transformed into a very mellow holy man, exhibiting the same docile behavior and mystical inscrutability of patients of modern shock therapy. I would guess he was also pretty interesting to talk to-full of spiritu- al insights and profound messages from God. So that, dear ones, is the secret of the Ark of the Covenant. But, I hear you asking, what about the true pronunciation of n,n\" the ineffable name of God? Well, I think every year it was pronounced a little differently, but if I were to give you a general idea of how it sounded, I would say it sounded something like ..."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"78 / CHICKEN ~BALAH HEEEEEEEE w ~OOooooOOOOO , .... 6 ____________ ........c. _ THE FOUR Qb.BALISTIC WORLDS AND THE FOUR PARTS OF THE SOUL Introduced by Lon Milo DuQuette There aren't really four Qabalistic Worlds-only one with amnesia. -RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD I n the Spring of 1991, Rabbi Ben Clifford became obsessed with the idea of making a Qabalistic documentary.

Do you see where this is taking us? The more we divide the Great One, the more knowledge and understanding we uncover from the individual parts. But, at the same time, we drift farther from the abstract perfection of the One. The ancient Qabalists delighted in dividing the One in many ways, but the primary, and some say, supreme division was by four, and they gave this fourfold Deity a four-letter name: Yod Heh Vau Heh. [pointing again to building] That building over there is one building with four floors. Let's go inside and see what One looks like when it is divid- ed into four parts.

Thousands of chairs of every size and description, even benches, stools, and pews. Rabbi walks over to a huge overstuffed chair, sits down and says.] RABBI: Ah .... This is what I need. We are in the chair division of the material universe. There are lots of other divisions, too. In fact, there is a section on this floor for absolutely every- thing in the phenomenal universe, including you ~d me- a table section, a tree section, a canned soup section, a sec- tion for small vibrating appliances-even a section for solar systems and galaxies- all right here on Floor One. Qabalists call this world Assiah.? the material plane. It's the lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds, and is represented by the final letter Heh in the Great Name. But back to these chairs. Where do they all come from? You might answer that the wood comes from trees, and the nails come from raw metal, and the wool coverings come from sheep, but you would be wrong, because all you are really saying is that the wood comes from the tree section of this floor, the nails from the metal section, and the wool from sheep division of the material plane. That being the case, where on Earth do all these chairs come from? The fact is, nothing on this floor comes from Earth at all.

The reason we find him in the likeness of Edison and taking a nice shower in the great inventor's bathroom is to help us illustrate something about this Qabalistic World-the world of Briah, the Creative World. Now, Edison didn't invent the chair, but he did invent (or improve upon) an unbelievable number of things that brought revolutionary change to the world; the light bulb, the phonograph, and motion pictures, to name a few. There's no doubt about it, the man was a genius. But we might ask, how could one man possibly invent all of those things? Where did he get the time? Let's watch for a few moments. {Suddenly the singing stops. The water is turned off. Silence.

And when it comes out the big end it's real loud! Real loud! See? RABBI [voice hushed}: Let's just take a look at that mirror. All we see is a crude cylinder, two squiggly lines, something that looks like a box, and a cone resting on its side with an arrow pointing at the large end and the words, \"Big noise comes out here!\" {Clifford stares blankly at the mirror] EDISON: I call it the phonograph.

Atziluth could be considered the will of the Deity in its purest aspect. It's the highest and most perfect of the four worlds. In Atziluth there is no separation of the male and female aspects of the Deity; they are eternally united in bliss The remaining three worlds are the products of this ecsta- tic union, and as we have seen, continue to diminish in puri- ty as we descend to the lower floors.

Up here in Atziluth there are no forms or images, just pure con- scious energy-a dynamo of bliss. But it sounds like even this dynamo needs to kick back and relax on occasion, if only to experience within itself the pulse of an expanding and contracting creation cycle. Of course, in other sections of this floor, the Deity is ger- minating other nebulous desires that will eventually mani- fest on the first floor in Assiah as absolutely everything in the phenomenal universe. But right here in Atziluth, three levels above the chairs in the Material World, the vague desire for rest is unique to this particular section of the Deity's con- sciousness. Oh listen!

This is a dissection room of the Qabalistic morgue, and I have volunteered my body for a lit- tle demonstration of the four parts of the soul. Because humans are \"made in the image\" of the Deity, we reflect the same dynamics as our huge and eternal COUnter- part. Each of us is a four story Yod, Heh, Vau, Heh, with our own little Arzilurh, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah right here inside us-four parts of our soul which Qabalists refer to as (starting at the top) Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach, and Nephesh. Like the Qabalistic worlds, the three lower parts of the soul are just the distorted image of our real identity, Chiah, the life-force itself RABBI; The lowest part of the soul, which corresponds to Assiah, the Material World, is called the Nephesh-animal vitality or the animal soul. The physical body is not really the Nephesh, but the veil of the Nephesh. I call it Nephesh crust. As science advances and we learn more and more about the neural-electrical- magnetic nature of the body, it gets harder to determine where the crust leaves off and the Nephesh begins. Let's just say for starters that the Nephesh is that primitive level of consciousness that we share with the animal kingdom-our instincts, our primitive appetites, emotions and sex drive, our survival mechanisms. We can observe the Nephesh man- ifest most clearly in individuals who, because of unfortunate circumstances, are deprived of the proper function of the rational mind. We can also spot it in ourselves in moments of blind rage, or when we are so frightened of a fire we jump out the window of a 16-story building, or when we get so horny we forget this fling will ruin our lives. Wild and dangerous as the Nephesh can be, it makes each of us complete-an accurate reflection of the greater spiritu- al reality-it is where we live-it is our personal Assiah and every angel in the celestial realms would give its right wing to own one.

Above the Nephesh, corresponding to the world of Yetzirah and the Vau of the Tetragrammaton, is the Ruach- the Intellect and the vehicle of Self-awareness. Now, obvi- ously my physical head and brain are not the real Ruach, because all organic things are too gross to qualifY for Ruach- hood. But as you look at my head here in this laboratory pan, I want you to think. If your feet and your legs were amputated, you would still be you, right? And if your arms were amputated, wouldn't you still consider yourself you? Provided science could keep you alive, how much of your body could be amputated or removed before you would lose your you-ness? Yo~ might answer you would still be you as long as you can think and maintain consciousness of yourself. But that's the big Ruach lie! Thinking and consciousness are not the same thing-not the same thing at all. The Ruach part of your soul monopolizes your attention to suc~ a.degree that you identifY yourself completely with t~e thInking process. Descartes fell for this hook, line, and SInker when he said \"Cogiro ergo sum-I think, therefore I am.\" Ultimately, the real you doesn't need the \"think\" part of the equation to \"maintain consciousness.\" Even if you could no longer \"think\" there would still be \"you\" and there would still be \"consciousness.\" The Ruach part of your soul, how- ever, is incapable of grasping that subtle fact. It is unable to transcend itself to imagine a self without thinking. Like a narcissistic and domineering mother, Ruach con- sumes your full attention-causing you to think about life rather than live it-seek understanding rather than enlight- enment-comprehension rather than bliss.

Interior Rabbi's head~a cozy den with a modest fireplace before which we find a golden retriever asleep on a braided rug, and the Rabbi reclined in an easy chair. He is calmly smoking a pipe. His eyes are closed, but the brow of his forehead is furrowed as if he is in profound thought or mystical reverie. He never opens his eyes but continues his narration in voice-over. RABBI: The Neshamah, the Thomas Edison Archangel part of your soul, is the Soul Intuition. It is our Transcendent Awareness, that part of us that rises above the thinking process and vibrates in greater harmony with the ultimate reality. We can't really understand the Neshamah because the machinery of our thoughts is based in Ruach, and can only take in so much information before going into overload and breaking down. For our illustration here, we view my Neshamah as being centered inside my physical skull. It mayor may not be cen- tered there, but there is one thing for certain-the Neshamah part of our soul reaches infinitely farther than the confines of our physical body. As a matter of fact, for all intents and purposes, the scope of the Neshamah is infinite. It is in touch with energies and levels of consciousness our Ruach would not understand even if it could conceive of them. We have all heard stories of mothers, separated from their ~hil~re~ by hundreds or thousands of miles, knowing tnsttnCtlvely when their young one's are in danger. Is this because at the traumatic moment the child emits some kind of signal is that telegraphed across the ocean to the mother? No! It is because the mother's Neshamah is so huge the child can never escape it, no matter how many miles separate their physical bodies. A mother's intuition is only a very primitive example of this Transcendent Awareness. It is clear to me that if it were possible to understand the scope and potential of the human Neshamah we could solve many of the mysteries surround- ing the so-called \"supernatural\" events of religious traditions and the unanswered questions of modern psychic research. The highest part of the soul that corresponds to Atziluth, the Archetypal World, and the Yod of the Tetragrammaton, is called the Chiah. It is the undiluted Life-Force itself, and it is our true identity. All the other parts of the soul are veils of the Chiah. Just as the physical body is the crust of the Nephesh, and the Nephesh forms the crust of the Ruach, and the Ruach forms the crust of the Neshamah-the Neshamah forms the crust of the Chiah. If we found the Neshamah hard to talk about, our Chiah is even more chal- lenging.

The Ruach is self- aware and aware the self is living. The Neshamah is the essence of life's awareness, but the Chiah is Life itself, the soul's true identity. If there is any purpose for our incarnations, it is to perfectly integrate the four parts of our soul so that we can function as perfect units of the supreme consciousness and uninhibitedly manifest that consciousness on all planes of existence.

Qabalistic device, but its components (the 10 primal emanations of creation, or Sephirorh.s and the 22 paths that connect them) display with remarkable simplicity the most important and venerable principles of Qabalistic doctrine. Although the Tree of Life, as such, is not mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah,3 it is the visual elaboration of the fundamental statement of that great text that informs us that \"Deity created the universe in 32 mysterious paths of wisdom-1 0 Sephiroth out of nothing and 22 letters.\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"106 / CHICKEN Qj,.BALAH How did the authorts) of the Sepher Yetzirah reach the conclu- sion that 10 5ephiroth out of nothing and 22 letters were the vehi- cles of divine creation? Most certainly it was an oral tradition predat- ing the Sepher Yetzirah, but it had to have originated somewhere. Predictably Rabbi Ben Clifford had the answer, and this chapter is dedicated to his thoughts on the matter. What follows are transcriptions and notes from two long- suppressed tape recordings made by Ben Clifford in 1978 and 1979. During the period of his public ministry, these early tapes, and the so- called documents that accompanied them, posed somewhat of an embarrassment to his students who believed, with good reason, that if they were made public Ben Clifford's reputation would be irreparably damaged. The source of this concern stemmed not from the content of the material (which, as we shall soon see, is rich in Qabalistic wis- dom), but from the incredulous format of the presentation. It appears the Rabbi would actually have us believe that he pos- sessed original \"essays\" written over twenty-five hundred years ago by students of the Zerubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth. I am sure I do not have to tell the reader that Ben Clifford is again having us on in this matter. But please don't let this literary device tempt you to dismiss the value of these little compositions. They are some of the most ingenious examples of Qabalistic logic I have ever seen dis- played. I find it quite easy to believe that, sometime in the distant past, the fundamental elements of the Qabalah were developed in a manner not too dissimilar to that outlined by these imaginary stu- dents.

Let's imagine that we are the first students of that great Qabalistic school. We are not sure how we got here. Perhaps we earned a scholarship. Perhaps our fathers are wealthy, or members of the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce, or they are government or temple officials. Regardless of how we came to be here, our assign- ment is simple. We are to think about things-all day-all night. To focus our considerations, and to give us scaffolding upon which to perform our mental gymnastics, our teachers have provided us with a single text, The Pentateuch: The Five Books of Moses. 5 We are told that these writings are holy, and if we apply ourselves diligently, every mys- tery of Heaven and Earth will reveal itself to us in these pages. \"But sir?\" a learned student might have injected, \"I've read the Pentateuch scores of times, and the mysteries of Heaven and Earth have not revealed themselves to me.\" \"Then, my son,\" our teacher might have answered, \"You must seek them--one sentence, one word, one letter at a time.

We are ~ot told that snakes, or aardvarks, or fish, or worms, or any other animals or plants were created in the image of the Elohim, It seems to me that the question that begs asking is: \"What sep- arates human beings from other animals?\" I think I have the answer, at least I have an answer. Thumbs! We have thumbs! Sure, apes and monkeys and a few lemurs have thumbs, but none of them use them to create things. The fact that our thumb opposes the other four fingers is one very important thing that separates us from the rest of our animal neighbors. With the opposable thumb our ancestors made weapons, harnessed fire, fashioned tools and implements, created works of art, and hitch-hiked. Our hands make us creative beings Gust like the Deity), and the thumb is the key to our hand's success. Therefore I have made the following conclusions: â¢ The \"hand\" of the Creator (or the creative mechanics of the universe) must be an absolute unity (represented by the thumb), and that It executes Its creative power through a fOurflld process (represented by the four fin- gers). This, I believe, is the primary reason our venerable ancestors worshiped one God whose great Name is com- posed of jour letters.f M , M \\ â¢ The Hebrew word for \"hand\" is' , ~ YOD. Yod is the LOth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and the fundamental letter of the alphabet. As my father taught me, \"lOd is a flame. Blow upon it and you fOrm all the other letters of the alphabet. \"Yod represents the number 10 in our system of counting. Furthermore, we can see that the holy number 4 itself conceals the number 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10). Conclusion: After meditating upon myself and my hand I conclude that there is one God who creates through a fOurfold process and ultimately man- ifests through ten levels of expression. For this reason, I contend that the numbers ONE, FOUR, and TEN be considered holy and of pri- mary importance in our study. Final Note: Dear Dr. Roe, This essay is 398 words in length.

I agree wholeheartedly with all his conclu- sions and wish to use them as the foundation of further discussion. I think we can all agree that the creative power of the human hand, with its opposable thumb, is a key characteristic that separates humans from other forms of terrestrial life. It is also very logical that we, being created in the image of God, should conclude that God is an absolute monad who executes Its creative power through a four- fold process. This supports our tradition of the Four Qabalistic Worlds 9 which are mirrored in humans by the Four Parts of the Soul.l? and should earn our veneration for the numbers ONE and FOUR. Brother Shechaniah also pointed out that, because the word Yod (hand) is the tenth letter of the sacred Hebrew Alphabet, and that Yod represents the number 10, we should hold the number TEN in high regard as well. Also, we must remember that we have two hands, with a total of ten fingers, and this fact further underscores the importance of the number TEN."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"114 / CHICKEN Q!.BALAH THE TREE OF LIFE / 1 IS I now wish to point out that the word Yod (YVD , ,~) spelled in full (Y~ = 10, V, = 6, D' = 4) adds to the number TWENTY, which reminds us that we (and therefore God) have twenty digits, for, as the wise cobbler said, we mustn't forget our roes. Now you may ask, \"Is TWENTY as significant and as holy a number as ONE or FOUR or TEN?\" I say no, because our ten toes, while providing certain symmetry to our bodies, do not exactly set us apart from other less spiritually endowed creatures. But in between our two sets of fingers there is one thing that does. Our tongue! We have a tongue-the power of speech! Through speech we communicate and inform-just as the Deity does! Through speech we create images in our minds and in the minds of others- just as the Deity does! Through speech we give names to all things in our environment and organize our thoughts-just as the Deity does! Through speech we bless and curse our friends and enemies-just as the Deity does! Through speech we command, subjugate, and exploit anyone whose will is weaker than our own-just as Deity does! Finally, between our two sets of toes is another member that actu- ally gives us the power to create other human beings in our own image. True, humans are not the only creatureswho reproduce. But our father Abraham entered into a covenant with the Deity, a covenant sealed by a curious gesture of mutilation. The rite of circumcision not only sym~ bolizes our obedience to our God, but also our acknowledgment to ourselves that we can master and control our sexual drives for the greater good of family, our race, and humanity in general. Conclusion: I think we all can agree that our unique powers of speech, and the godlike power of creation (that both men and women carry in their loins), certainly qualifY as divine characteristics, and elevate the mar- velous number TWENTY-TWO ro equal status with ONE, FOUR, and TEN. As our holy Hebrew alphabet is composed of 22 letters, I think there can be no debate on this matter. -Ramiah, the son of ]eziah ASSIGNMENT NO.2: Role-Playing Exercise. YOu are the Deity.

Winning Essay No. 1 Submitted by Zabad, the son of Aziza After studying the last few winning essays, I have to confess that I'm a little embarrassed to share the fruits of my meditations. I don't come from the big city like most of my fellow students, and so I guess the wheels of my mind naturally seek out the ruts of homier byways of deliberation. All I know is that if I were the Deity before creation, I must have been very lonely. Being the only and absolute Being, I might not even realize the nature of my own self. I symbolize this pre-creational state as a simple circle (I have chosen this figure because a circle has no beginning or end) and designate it by the holy number ONE. Figure 12. The Holy Number 1. Now, since I am ONE and absolute, it follows that ONE is the only real number-the only legitimate reality. As the Deity, I think I would be quite happy in my condition of oneness, and leave it at that, but something clearly happened to induce me to create. In order"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"116 / CHICKEN Qb.BALAH THE TREE OF LlFE / 1 1'/ for me to create the many things in the universe, I would need to ere- ate more numbers. I think it happened like this: I was alone and bored, and began to ponder the nature of. myself \"What am I?\" This was difficult because I was the only ONE. I had nothing else with which to compare myself. I wasn't a \"this\" or a \"that\" because I had not yet created \"thises\" or \"thats.\"l was the absolute, there was no \"outside\" of me. I could not hold up a mirror and look at my image and say, \"Oh look! I'm one of thosel'\" I could, however, with great stillness and concentration, turn the focus of my attention inward and, like the holy men of India, observe my perfect reflection at the very center of my being. I would' then for the first time be conscious of myself. \"I am this!\" I would shout. Even instantly, as these words echoed in my absoluteness, I would fall from my pristine state of singularity, for I would now have to admit the concept of TWO: Myself (\"I am ... \") and my reflection (\" ... this\"). Â® Figure 13. The concept of two. Oh! Curse the moment I ever brought TWO into existence, because the moment my Self became conscious of my reflection (my Not-Self), a third concept was created, that is ... the knowl- edge of the difference between Self and Not-Self \"I am 'this' but 'that' is not I.\" Figure 14. The concept of three. Conclusion: I assert that creation commenced when the Deity stirred from undis- tracted ecstasy and became self-conscious, an act which transfo~med Its self-existence (as the inscrutable Divine Unity) into Its self-zmage (as the Deity of creation). Therefore, I suggest that we also consider the number THREE one of our primary holy numbers. -Zabad, the son of Aziza Winning Essay No.2 Submitted by Jozabad, the son of Shimei Adar, 28th, 520 B.C.

Be that as it may, my self-control and dedication to study has rewarded me with the following: Since TWO and THREE are merely attributes of ONE, they should be considered along with the number ONE as a Trinity Unit.

It reflectsÂ· itself to create a second Trinity Unit: Conclusion: As Zabad concluded, creation commences when the Deity defines itself and becomes self-conscious-a three-part act which defines ONE as an abstract and unmanifested Trinity (the Supernal Triad). But what Zabad was apparently too distracted to realize was that the Deity cannot stop at self-knowledge. Momentum has been estab- lished which will result in a further series of six phenomenal emana- tions by which the universe will categorize itself and organize its infi- nite potentialities.

When we look at all ten steps of creation, we see that the TENTH emanation is the reflec- is reflected and made tion of the NINTH, which is the manifest upon the Sun reflection of the SIXTH, which is the reflection of the ONE.

I think it should be obvious to Rabbi Roe and the entire class that I have mastered the assignment and have wrenched all the wisdom that can be extracted from this line of thinking. I suggest we now move on to another subject, like when do we go co-ed? -Zabad, the son of Aziza Grand Prize Winning Essay Submitted by Ramiah, the son of jeziah Once again I am stunned at the intelligence and wisdom exhibited by my classmates, especially the fruits of the recent exchanges between Zabad, the son of Aziza, and ]ozabad, the son of Shimei. I most humbly confess that my feeble mind could never have developed the Ten Numbered Bubbles of'jozabad, or Zabad's Twelve Paths of Glory. Please know that anything I might add at this point must only be viewed as my dwarfish mental stature standing upon the shoulders of these two giants. Still, I must strenuously disagree with Zabad's assertion that we have concluded our meditation on the diagram that he and ]ozabad have labored so diligently to erect. As I was the first in the class to draw our attention to the holiness of the number 22, I must respectfully point out certain flaws in Zabad's thinking concerning his \"Twelve Paths of Glory.\" I will begin by pointing out that I believe there are two additional pillars that flank the middle pillar (figure 21). As it is postulated, each one of us is made in the image of the Deity. These two pillars correspond to the right and left side of the human body (the middle pillar being the spine). They also accom- modate the entire spectrum of universal opposites that so profoundly Figure 21. Note the two additional \"pillars. \" divide our perception of reality; light-darkness, male-female, strength-weakness, the middle pillar serving to balance and harmo- nize these extremes. Furthermore, I believe that the paths which join the 10 Sephiroth are not merely nails that attach the emanations, but are actually conduits of divine intelligence, which transmit the influence of each Sephirah back and forth between its neighbor. Consequently, all the Sephiroth should be joined by paths (shown in figure 22 on page 124) . You will notice in my diagram that I have drawn broken paths leading from 3 to 4 and from 2 to 5. This is because I believe that these paths do not exist. To explain this, we must return for a moment to Zabad's earlier essay, which explained how ONE became THREE.

Just as I give a kind of life to my reflection in the mirror, so all the manifold units of creation are vivified by the Living Light of the Supernal Triad. Indeed, that Light is our true identity. What we think is our body, our world, our self, is only the shadowy reflection of the Divine Being whose radiance shattered at the Abyss. We aren't even truly alive, we are just the reflection of real life. \"And created the Elohim Adam in the image of Elohim created they them, male and female created they them.\" Just as we cannot walk into a room reflected in a mirror, a path cannot exist between CD of the Supernal Triad and 0 of the second Triad. Other paths appear to cross the Abyss, but they aren't really Paths, but either reflected paths or avenues of reflection: Figure 23.

He taught that summoning spirits to do one's bidding was perfectly compatible with his field- theory, which states, \"It's all in your head, you just have no idea how big your head is.\" He insisted that the successful completion of any act of will was a form of spirit evocation.

The accompanying essay also reveals Ben Clifford's basic attitudes regard- ing the underlying theory of Qabalistic ceremonial magick and, I believe, should be of immeasurable value to anyone who may wish to embark on such practices. But before we turn to the essay, I would like us to examine the contents of a short but provocative letter Ben Clifford wrote to an Indiana student in 1988. His letter is in response to several questions the student posed concerning the evocation of spirits of the Goetia.! The Rabbi himself confessed that his answers were gross simpli- fications. Nevertheless, I know of no better definition of the under- lying theory of Qabalistic magick and spirit evocation than his last sentence: \"Gods, archangels, angels, spirits, intelligences, and demons are personifications of all our abilities and potential abili- ties-a wondrous hierarchy of consciousness that represents the sub- divisions of our own soul.\" Are the spirits good or evilf Yes, they are good.

Of course these are worst-case scenarios. Most of us have enough reign on our spirits to keep us out of prison or the booby hatch. But all of us could do much better-and the world most definitely would be a better place if we all did better. Let's take another look at your questions that I answered so glibly, and give them just a bit more attention. Are the spirits good or evil? Yes, the spirits are good or evil, in the same way electricity is both good and evil depending upon how it is directed. Are the spirits real or just imaginary? The spirits are both real and imaginary, but most of us do not realize how real our imagination is. Are the spirits part of me, or do they live an existence independent of me? The spirits are inside you, but most of us do not realize (1) how big our insides really are, or (2) how much out of control and seemingly independent the things inside us can be. For a moment, let's pretend that your brain (and remember, sci- entists tell us we use only a tiny fraction of our brain's potential) is the source of all your power and ability to do anything. (Of course it isn't. Remember the four parts of the soul and the fact your Neshamah, the Soul Intuition, was incredibly huge, and that it was the part of the soul that enables your mother to freak out whenever you're in trouble, even if you were on the Moon?) But, just for sim- plicity's sake, let's say all your powers and abilities are functions of the brain. Because the brain (under this pretend scenario) is the all-powerful director of our being, we could call it the god of our lives. This god is a good administrator, and knows how to effectively delegate authori- ty to get things done. However, having no resources outside of itself to draw upon, the brain-god must divide itself into several large departments, creating from itself a board of directors. One board member controls our logical and deductive processes, another our imagination and artistic sensibilities. Another board member dominates our sleep and dreams, and one quietly interfaces with our nervous systems. These large sections of the brain-these members of the board of directors, are archangels who execute the will of the brain-god. If we were to dissect the archangel areas of the brain, we would discover that within each of them are smaller areas that do more spe- cific jobs within the archangel's province. For instance, within the archangel of logic we would find the area that adds and subtracts and observes and registers the process of cause and effect. We might find within the artistic archangel an area that allows us to appreciate a beautiful painting, or a sector that sounds an alarm when we see a man wearing brown shoes and white socks with a tuxedo. These middle-management subdivisions of the archangelic zones of the brain are angels. Further dividing the brain, we discover that within each of these angelic regions are even smaller areas that control even more specific applications of their angelic department. We could keep dividing and dividing, creating ever smaller ever more specific intelligences, spir- its, and yes, even demons.

I'm confident that you are all saying to your- selves, \"Why, I would have thought of that if I had nothing to do all day but to think about stuff!\" However, there are many important and practical aspects of the Tree that were not covered in these doc- uments by the first ZIPYites, and so it falls to me to fill,in some of the gaps. Before I go on, however, I want you never to lose sight of the fact that when we talk about the Sephiroth we are talking about levels of consciousness. When I use the term \"pure light of Kether\" I'm not talking about some big flashlight in the cosmos, I'm talking about the pure omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, ornni-the-whole- damned-ball-of-wax consciousness of Deity. Keeping that in mind, we must remember that even before we toyed with the idea of the Tree of Life we pondered three kinds of wonderful Nothing (Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur) that, like some huge and tiny cosmic egg, somehow managed to bring ONE"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"136 / CHICKEN QJ\\BALAH QA B A LIS TIC MAG I C K AND THE T R E E 0 F L I F E / I :I 'I (Kether, the Crown, the Self of Deity) into existence.

Qabalists further dissect the universe of consciousness by organizing everything into four categories-four Trees of Life. Each Tree corre- sponds to one of the Four Letters in the Great Divine Name Yod- Heh-Vau-Heh, the four Qabalistic Worlds, and the four parts of the human soul (see figure 27, page 139). Remember, these are levels of consciousness, and not places or heavens located somewhere out in space. If you are waiting to die so you can go to one of these \"higher\" planes, you might be very disap- pointed. Death might not be what you think it is, and there is no rea- son to believe you will be any smarter than you were when you were alive. Make the effort to attain illumination while you still have a four-part soul. This Divine pecking order is the corporate flow chart of the uni- verse, and of you and me. The ten segments of Deity in Arziluth rule the ten archangels in Briah, who rule the ten groups of angels in Yetzirah, who rule the various spirits down here in the material plane of Assiah. It's easy to see who rules whom if we imagine the four trees placed one over another, as shown in figure 28 on page 140. Spirits are the agents who actually do all the heavy lifting on the material plane. You may think you disagree with me on this.

Archangels in Briah Angels in Yetzirah Intelligences, Spirits, and Demons in Assiah ~ ~ 1l!1Eb- â¢ Activating my unambiguous spiritual authority as your teacher, I declare the Divine Name (vibrations of sound declaring my thirst) and inspire an archangel (student- Briah) to fulfill my desire. â¢ The archangel then activates an army of angels within himself (in Yetzirah); angels of the eye to seek out and locate the water cooler, angels of nerves and muscles and equilibrium to propel him through space and around obstacles until he reaches his goal. â¢ At the water cooler, the angel then employs the Intelligences and Spirits of gravity and hydrodynamics to fill the glass with water (Assiah). the instruments that push things around down here. But in truth, it is a spiritual hierarchy that is execuror of everything that gets done in the phenomenal universe. For example, I am standing here at the podium at the head of the classroom. I am thirsty and would like a drink of water. I ask a stu- dent if he would be kind enough to bring me a glass of water. The kindly student gets up, goes to the water cooler at the back of the classroom, draws me a glass of water and delivers it to me. This simple scenario doesn't seem very magical does it? However, from my point of view it was a miraculously successful conjuration. By strength of my will (and with only a few well-chosen magical words of enchantment) I set into obedient motion an entire hierar- chy of spiritual beings; â¢ The process is then reversed until the archangel delivers the water to me thereby fulfilling the will of the Deity. This may not be what you think of when you think of magick, but I assure you it is magick. In fact, most of the spiritual activity that took place in the above scenario actually occurred on the invisible plane. No one could see my words of enchantment. No one could see the internal processes that inspired and propelled the student to the water cooler, or the invisible force of gravity. For all intents and purposes, I wanted a drink of water and only seconds after focusing my will upon that desire, a glass of water traveled through space and appeared in my hands.

After all, these guys are easily bamboozled. They go where they're pointed and do what they're told. They're accustomed to fol- lowing orders from higher intelligences. However, in magick, it's not what you know but whoyou are that counts, and before you can pro- ceed to bamboozle a spirit into believing you are a higher intelli- gence, you must first bamboozle yourself into believing you are a higher intelligence! If I want to enchant Tina, the girl next door, to fall in love with me, it doesn't matter that I know that Jehovah Tzabaoth is that aspect of Deity served by Haniel, who governs Anael of the Elohim, who commands Hagiel by whom is Kedemel- compelled. I must first per- fectly realize that somewhere in my own complex spiritual composi- tion is a perfect working model of Jehovah Tzabaoth, Haniel, Elohim, Anael of the Elohim, Hagiel, and Kedemel. I must be able to actually identify with the top guy in my own organization, and from that position of authority beseech the archangel to help me con- jure the angel that I may order the intelligence in his name so that the spirit will listen to me when I command it to do my bidding. Now, does this mean that you will have to study and master all those tongue-twisting god-names and archangels, and angels that (let's face it) mean nothing to you? Does this mean that you will then have to labor to somehow integrate this mountain of memorized data into your subjective consciousness? Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it! The essence of this wonderful organization is already integrated into your spiritual matrix. It (and the infinite number of other ways of looking at creation) came as standard equipment when you were born as a human being. You can, of course, memorize all the goodies if you want to, and I'm sure there will be some of you who will want to. 3 But I want you to know that it is not essential to do so. It is only necessary that you program your spiritual worldview with this image of an ordered hier- archy of consciousness. Eventually, your recognition of these Qabalistic facts of life will enable you to effortlessly and naturally align and harmonize the .various aspects of your consciousness with the Qabalistic facts of life. Once this is achieved (and it will most likely happen without you realizing that it has happened) you will discover your place in the divine hierarchy and why only you can fill that position. I have prepared a flow chart (Table 3, pages 144-145) that shows the classic Qabalistic hierarchy of divine name, archangel, angel (and the angelic choir to which it belongs) and the intelligence and spirit attributed to each Sephirah on the Tree of Life. You can use this information to construct complex rituals of formal evocation, such as those found in any number of magical texts. You can also design simple house-and-garden variety spells such as this ditty I wrote and recited at the appearance of Venus in the evening or early morning sky: o Lord of Hosts, Jehovah Tzabaotb, YOu know the dreams of fools.

His 1992 interview in the American Tarot jour- nal, Augury 1Oday, gave his enemies all the ammunition they would need to permanently discredit him. Still, he seemed to enjoy the ridicule heaped upon him from conservative quarters, and took fiendish delight in promoting the study and use of the tarot cards.

It is a sad fact that Ben Clifford did not write extensively on the tarot. What follows is the entire Augury TOday interview and illustra- tions reprinted with the kind permission of Credulity Publications, Inc. We must keep in mind the fact that in this interview Ben Clifford was addressing a readership of professional Tarot readers and enthusiasts, and not his own students (or imaginary students). Consequently, we see that he was obliged to introduce fundamental Qabalistic principals that have already been touched upon elsewhere in this book. I hope the reader will forgive these redundancies because the interview is a wonderful example of how the Rabbi went about introducing the Qabalah to non-Qabalists. I should like especially to call the reader's attention to the final section of the interview in which Ben Clifford discusses the excep- tional status of the four Princess cards of the tarot. Besides exhibiting the Rabbi at his irascible best, it is a marvelous essay that neatly dove- tails many Qabalistic principles we've learned so far concerning the nature of the soul. It also introduces us to the concept of the Holy Guardian Angel, a key element of modern Qabalistic practices. Long Island Queballa 1 Guru Sez Tarot Cards Are ''Aleph-OK!''

Is that how you pronounce it a 1. Qabalah? LBC: Pronounce it any damned way you want. AT:: Well ... so ... I will then. Thank you. That lifts a burden from my shoulders. I'm always afraid I'm going to mispronounce all these exotic and esoteric words. LBC: Lifting spiritual burdens is my job. I've worked hard to gain enlightenment just so you won't have to. AT: Oh ... well ... Thank you. Now, Rabbi ... may I call you Ben? LBC: No."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ISO/CHICKEN Qb.BALAH AT: Right then. Let's start by asking why an authority on the Hebrew Qabalah such as yourself would be interested in Tarot cards? LBC: Because working with the Tarot is the fastest way I know of learning Qabalistic fundamentals and one of the most practical things one can do with the Qabalah. AT: I don't understand. LBC: The Hebrew Qabalah forms the foundation of the Western Mystery Tradition and the Western Hermetic arts. This tradition includes Astrology, Alchemy, Jewish and Christian Mysticism, Ceremonial Magick, and Tarot. Of all of these disciplines, the Tarot is the most perfect representation of Qabalistic fundamentals and is the common denominator between the various systems. Whether we realize it or not, when we work with the Tarot, we are working with the Qabalah. Tarot's like the DNA of the Qabalah- better than that-it's actually the picture-book of the Qabalah. I know there are many tarotists who are aware of the Qabalistic roots of the Tarot but, for one reason or another, they choose not to incorpo- rate any Qabalistic wisdom in their arsenal of Tarot tools. AT: Perhaps that's because the Qabalah is based on the Bible, is it not? How could it possibly be relevant to those of us who are not Jewish or Christian? LBC: Some people think that because the Qabalah seems to be based on the Bible that it must be reserved for Jews or Christians, and therefore it has no place in neo-pagan or New Age thought. Such is not the case. The Qabalah is not a belief system. It's a way of looking at things. It's a way of organizing your universe so neatly that you eventually discover your own place in it. It's a way of connecting absolutely everything in the universe with absolutely everything else until, eventually, you achieve a transcendent level of consciousness in which you realize there is nothing left to connect. CHICKEN TAROT / I~I AT: Is the Qabalah a book? LBC: No, the Qabalah is not a boo~, but ther~ are many Qabalistic texts, some of them are pretty bizarre. If you re not ca~eÂ­ ful, you'll wind up squandering thirty or forty years of your .life counting the nostril hairs of God. I know folks who have done Just that. It's sad. It's worse than falling asleep with leprechauns when you're young, and waking up old and gray-with dead leaves in your pockets and snowflakes in your hair. AT: Al ... mighty then. Could you please explain your Qabalah universe and how it relates to the Tarot cards? LBC: First of all, there is only one universe, only one absolut~. Call it God. Call it what you want, but It's the One thing that contains all the other things in the world-It's the great One beyond which. there is nothing. Now, that \"nothing\" is a pretty important concept in the Qabalah, because that's where the One and subs~qu~ntly all the other stuff comes from. In the Tarot, this super-nothing is represented by the Fool card. A pure buffoon skips toward his doom. An abyss of profound uncertainties. It takes a Fool to seed that womb With all possible, possibilities. Ultimately, the Fool is the only real Tarot card. In essence, all the other cards live inside the Fool-just like you and me and all the other co~Â­ ponents of creation live inside the inscrutable consciousness of Deity. AT: Do all 78 cards live inside the Fool card? LBC: Technically, yes. Of course they do. But for our purposes it will be better to think of the Tarot as two distinct groups of cards. The Greater Arcana (or the 22 Trumps); and the Lesser Arcana (56 cards broken up into four suits, each suit containing one Ace, four Court Cards, and nine Small Cards)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"152 I CHICKEN QABALAH CHICKEN TAROT I LBC: I didn't think you did. Each of the 22 letters also has a basic meaning. For example, the Hebrew letter that is attributed to the Fool card is Aleph, and Aleph means \"ox.\" Now, it's probably unlike- ly that any of your clients are ever going to scream, \"My god, I'm going to marry an ox!\" but there are many other relevant things to the modern world of which the word \"ox\" is suggestive-strength, stability, fertility, harnessed energy-see what I mean? You can never predict how your awareness of this attribute might someday trigger a psychic reaction and provide you and your client the answer. The meanings of the Hebrew letters for the rest of the trumps AT: Again, Rabbi, I have to say ... If you did nothing more than learn the meanings of the Hebrew let- ters for each trump you would have 22 additional sources of infor- mation to draw upon when reading the cards. Let's look first at the trumps. We put the Fool under our micro-- scope and we see that there are 22 trumps (including the Foo~.

What a coincidence! The Hebrew alphabet is really the foundation of the Qabalah and (though it might not be immediate- ly obvious) the 22 trumps are the visual expressions of the 22 letters and their esoteric meanings. Now, some of your readers, might use the 22 trumps exclusively when they read the cards for themselves or others. If that's the case, each spread could actually be spelling out words. AT: You mean the cards could be literally spelling out the answer to a question? LBC: That's exactly what I'm saying. Tell me, what is one of the most common questions a Tarot reader is asked to answer? AT: . Questions of romance, I suppose. \"Should I marry my sweetheart?\" LBC: \"Should I marry my sweetheart?\" Fine! Using a standard ten- card Celtic-Cross spread with the Empress as the significator, you lay o~t the .Empress, H~erophant, Hanged Man, TOwer, World, Emperor, Ht~h Priestess, Hermit; Sun and justice. I'm sure there are infinite ways to Interpret these cards in this order, but one unmistakable character- istic of the spread is the fact that the cards spell the words \"DUMP THE GIRL.\" Vaporous mysticism is fine, but for Heaven's sake don't ignore the obvious!

In a reading, a zodiacal trump might obviously be pointing to a spe- cific time of year, perhaps the questioner's birth-sign, or that of someone else important to the reading. Maybe the card is pinpoint- ing an appropriate time to schedule an event such as a wedding, or a vacation. AT: But how can a tarot reader apply this information practical- ly in a reading? LBC: It all depends upon the question. If it concerns matters of health, a zodiac sign is attributed to each part of the body. The Moon card (Pisces) could indicate the feet, or the Lovers (Gemini), the lungs, or Strength card (Leo), the heart. There's no end to the appli- cations. Now please, I would like to move on to the planetary trumps. I'm getting hungry. You did say the magazine was treating me to din- ner, didn't you? AT: Yes, of course, the Carnegie Deli if you like. AT: But aren't these attributes astrological rather than Qabalistic? LBC: Hello? Don't you get it? Astrology and Qabalah come from the same place. Duh! Now please, let me go on. Signs of the zodiac represent more than just time coordinates. Each sign (and consequently each zodiac trump) has attached to it a litany of traditional plants, animals, precious stones, foods, drugs, and deities sacred to cultures and mythologies from around the world. All these attributes are hiding just below the surface of each card. I've got them all organized in a giant Rolodex in my garage. Whether we consciously recognize them or not, these are arche- typal images that we share with every other human being on the planet-and Qabalah is the glue that holds them all together. Depending upon the circumstances, the Justice card could stand for an emerald, or an aloe plant, or an elephant. The Emperor might sug- gest ruby, or geranium, or a ram.

Okay let's look at planetary trumps: The Magician is Mercury, the High Priestess is Luna, the Empress is Venus, the Wheel of Fortune is Jupiter, the TOwer is Mars, the Sun card is the Sun, and the World is Saturn. Those of your readers who are familiar with astrology know how important planetary influences are to a person's life. Obviously, we're not all astrologers, but the planetary trumps (like the zodiac trumps) have lots of traditional correspondences based on the Qabalah. For instance, each of the seven planets represents a day of the week. The Sun card obviously represents Sunday, the High Priestess is the Moon and Monday, the TOwer is Mars and Tuesday, the Magician is Mercury and Wednesday, the Wheel of Fortune is Jupiter and Thursday, the Empress is Venus and Friday, the World is Saturn and Saturday. Each of the planetary trumps also can point to one of the plane- tary metals. You may not think you will ever need to use this infor- mationin a reading, but just in case, it might be helpful to know that mercury is the metal for the Magician, silver rules the High Priestess, copper rules the Empress, tin rules the Wheel of Fortune, iron rules the TOwer, gold rules the Sun, and lead rules the World. The planetary trumps also represent parts of the human body. This information could be helpful in a reading concerning health mat- ters. The Magician rules the nervous system, the High Priestess the lym- phatic system, the Empress rules the reproductive system, the Wheel of , Fortune rules the digestive system, the TOwer rules the muscles, the Sun rules the circulatory system, and the World card rules the bones. AT: That leaves three final trump cards which stand for the ele- ments-Air, Water, and Fire-Am I correct? LBC: Correct. AT: What happened to the Earth element? Is there no room for Earth in your Qabalah universe? LBC: Don't be absurd. Of course there is room for Earth. But Earth is somewhat the stepchild of the universe-in precisely the same way that human beings are somewhat the stepchildren in the family of spiritual beings. We're vitally important stepchildren, how- ever, and I want to talk about that later. But now let's get back 'to the elemental trumps. There are three (actually four) trumps that represent elements: The Fool represents Air, the Hanged Man Water, and Judgement, Fire. These three trumps are attributed to the three Mother Letters of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, Mem, and Shin. The fourth element- Earth-is represented by the World card that assumes double duty with the very compatible planet Saturn. From a Qabalist's point of view, the elements (as represented by the four elemental trumps) convey a much higher octave of signifi- cance than the elemental building-blocks of nature which we will soon see are represented by the Aces, Court Cards and Small Cards. The elemental trumps might be more accurately viewed as profound and primitive spiritual elements. . For instance, the Air of the Fool, instead of representing the mundane concepts of Air, symbolizes the vital essence that animates all life (the Breath of Life). The Water of the HangedMan is the Great Sea-the universal menstrum that carries the vital essence of life (the Blood of Life); the Fire of Judgement is the central fire of life-the Holy Spirit-the spark that sustains, and finally consumes and trans- forms all existence. The World, being last and lowest of the trumps, represents both the planet Saturn and the element Earth. Saturn, according to"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"158 / CHICKEN Qt..BALAH CHICKEN TAROT / 159 LBC: Oh grow up! The Hanged Man tastes, judgement sees, and the World touches and feels. mythology, swallowed his own children. This dual attribution is a not so subtle hint that Earth is both the end and the beginning-the foundation of the universe and its dissolution. However, some very basic and practical attributes of the four ele- mental trumps are particularly helpful to me when I read the cards. For instance, they can be used to determine direction. The Fool is Air, which by tradition indicates the East; the Hanged Man is Water and the West; judgement is Fire, traditionally sacred to the South; and the World is Earth, symbolic of the cold North. I'm sure your readers can imagine a circumstance where this directional information could be helpful in a reading? Finally (and then we're going to move on to the Lesser Arcana- I'm starving to death), the four elemental trumps can represent our senses: The Fool smells ...

Are all Qabalisrs tarot experts also? LBC: I'm sad to say that most traditional Kabbalists (they spell it with a K and two Bs) accuse me of apostasy. They hold me and my teachings in great contempt.

Why are there four suits in the tarot? LBC: That is the best question you've asked today. Most of us are aware that the four suits are by tradition attributed to the elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. But where did the concept of these four elements come from? The answer comes straight out of the most fundamental doctrine of Hebrew mysticism-the Great Four-Letter Name of God-YOD HEH VAU HEH. Most nonJews pronounce this Jehovah. Most Jews hold the word in such reverence they never pronounce it at all. Hermetic Qabalists refer to it by its technical name, Tetragrammaton. In Hebrew mysticism and Qabalah, the great absolute Deity is too abstract to think about. I guess they figured they had a better chance at conceptualizing Deity if they chopped It up into pieces and then methodically meditated about the pieces. The Number Two was still too abstract, and the Number Three was held in such veneration that I guess they finally decided that it would be okay to chop Deity up into four pieces that they called Yod Heh Vau Heh. To these four pieces they attributed four worlds, which are real- ly layers or frequencies of divine consciousness by which Deity cre- ates everything with Its own thought. AT: How does that work exactly? LBC: How does that work exactly? Give me a break here! If I knew how it worked-exactly-I would be as smart as the Deity, wouldn't I? Theoretically, here's the drill: the Deity gets a good idea up in world number 1 (Atzilurh, the Archetypal World); and then that idea gets organized in world number 2 (Briah, the Creative World); then that organized idea gets visualized and formulated into a blueprint of the idea in world number 3 (Yetzirah, the Formative World); and finally, the idea actually manifests as an object, or a force, or an energy, down here in world number 4 (Assiah, the Material World). The concept is sort of like the Will, the Heart, the Mind, and the Flesh of Deity. Because, according to Qabalistic tradition, each of us was c~e~tÂ­ ed in the image of this four-part Deity, each of our souls is also dl~ldÂ­ ed up into four parts. The highest part of the soul is called the Chiah, the Life-Force itself. Then comes the Neshamah (the Soul Intuition), then the Ruach (our Intellect), and finally, the Nephesh (our Animal Soul). The four suits of the tarot are a perfect reflection of this con- cept. Can you see this? AT: I think so. I can picture the Deity divided into four parts, and I can imagine the same with the soul, but I don't quite under- stand exactly how the four parts of Deity and the four parts of our souls are connected. LBC: Just pretend the Deity is comprised of four incredibly gig:m- tic tuning forks that are vibrating four musical ~otes in a descending scale. (Remember these are vibrations of consciousness, not sound.) Now pretend your soul is comprised of four tiny tunin? for~ tuned to the same four notes. Even though our tuning forks are infinitely small- er they are still set into motion by the vibrations of the Deity's tuning forks, and vibrate in perfect tandem with them. Do you follow me? AT: Yes, I believe so. LBC: If you divide the 56 cards of the Lesser Arcana in~o four stacks one for Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks, you have this four- fold universe laid out in front of you. To really organize your world, lay each. of the four stacks face up, with the Ace ~n top ..Beneath the Ace put the four Court Cards (King, Queen, Prince, Princess), then the Small Cards (2 through 10). The four stacks with the Aces on top are the four letters in the Great Name, YOD HEH VAU HEH, and the cards underneath are the pieces of Deity, Its universe and our own souls. The Wan~s a~e the Yod stack, and by tradition are attributed to Fire; the Cups live III the first Heh stack and represent the Water element; the Swords are the Vau stack and Air; and the Disks are the Final Heh stack and are attributed to the Earth element."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"162 / CHI C KEN QA B A L A H CHICKEN TAROT / Now these elements are more than just the fire in your fireplace; or the water in your swimming pool, or the air in your lungs, or the earth in your garden. They are all things-all forces-all energies in the universe divided into categories that are either fiery in nature (like nuclear radiation, or Tabasco sauce, or enthusiasm); or watery in nature (like electromagnetism, or beer, or mirrors); or airy in nature (like daydreams, or radio signals, or winds) or earthy in nature (like a coal mine, or stubbornness, or gravity). It's the job of these four elements to join with other elements in different combinations and proportions to create the universe. They do this with the help of a fifth element called Spirit. Spirit enables the elements to stick together the same way atoms bond together to form molecules. At the same time, this magical element, Spirit, serves to separate the individual elements just enough so that each tiny unit of Fire, or Water, or Air, or Earth maintains its elemental identity. If Spirit didn't exist, the four elements would just smash together, turn- ing the universe into mush. Spirit is represented in both the Greater and LesserArcana of the Tarot. The Judgement card, as we recall, does double-duty as the Trump that represents both Spirit and Fire. But it is in the Lesser Arcana that Spirit reveals itself in remarkable detail by the four Aces, the Court Cards, and the Small Cards that live inside them (see fig- ure 30, page 159). The four Aces are really the big YOD, HEH, VAU, HEH and everything that goes with it. The Ace of Wands is Spirit of Fire; Ace of Cups is Spirit of Water; Ace of Swords is Spirit of Air; Ace of Disks is Spirit of Earth. Together, the four Court Cards of each suit are a miniature YOD HEH VAU HEH that subdivides their Aces into four parts. Kings are the fiery nature of their suit, Queens are the watery nature of their suit, Princes are the airy nature of their suit, and the Princesses are the earthy nature of their suit. Are you following this? The King of Wands is Fire of Fire. Do you see? Fire because he is a King, and Fire because he's a Wand. The King of Cups would be Fire of Water. Fire because he is King, and Water because his suit is Cups. See how it goes? The Queen of Cups would be ... ? AT: Water of Water! LBC: and the Princess of Swords would be ... ? AT: Earth of Air-the Princess is the earthy nature of her suit and Swords are Air. I get it! LBC: The Qabalist sees the wonders of creation as the result of the Deity shuffling the cards and dealing them out in different numbers and combinations. It shuffles and draws three or four here-perhaps to create the elemental recipe for a duck; or it deals out three or four cards over there to create pond scum or an aardvark. Do you see what I'm saying? AT: Yes! Absolutely fascinating! But how can we use this infor- mation to help us out in a tarot reading? Court Cards are for me the most difficult cards to interpret. LBC: With the Court Cards, we are in luck, because the Kings, Queens, and Princes each represent 30 degrees of the year (from 20 0 of one zodiac sign to 20 0 of the next sign). AT: What about the Princesses? LBC: Good question. I'll talk about the Princesses later. For the time being, let's just look at the Kings, Queens, and Princes. The rea- son why these twelve Court Cards rule from 20 0 of one sign to 20 0 of the next is to underscore the necessity for the elements to mix with other elements. If they ruled the entire 30 0 of a zodiac sign there would be no elemental mix. Besides, we already have twelve perfect- ly good zodiacal cards represented by the twelve zodiac trumps. It's pretty easy to determine which days in any given year a King, Queen, or Prince represents. This is extremely helpful in a reading, especially when inspiration fails us. At such times we can always remember that the Queen of Cups represents June 11th to July 11th,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"164 / CHICKEN Qj..BALAH CHICKEN TAROT / IllS 5~~Â§3QB8Q7 A <0 Capricorn Sag<\"''''~ CI /,) ~ Cardin.a!

It can be even more meaningful to think about the elemental mix of a Court Card, and how that would translate in the character of an individual or a situation. Kings are the fiery aspect of their suit and so display the most violent and dynamic aspects of their element, also the most fleeting. Queens, being watery, are receptive and hold on to, as well as reflect, the nature of their suit (although, like a good moth- er, she will eventually relinquish her hold to pass it on to her chil- dren). The Prince and Princess are literally the offspring of the King and Queen; the Prince the more active of the two. Certain elements combine harmoniously and others don't, but don't think you can nail down hard and fast definitions to the char- acter of any tarot card by simply combining buzzwords. No card lives in a vacuum. Its ultimate meaning depends on its relation to its neighbors and the nature of the question. For this reason, the tarot reader should ideally be a Qabalist-armed with the knowledge of the fundamental classifications of everything in his or her universe. Eventually illumination will come, not through analysis or contem- plation, but as the result of profound and simple observation. AT: Why Rabbi, that's sublime. I hardly know what to say. LBC: Good. Now let's talk about the 36 Small Cards. (I won't for- get the Princesses). Each of the 36 Small Cards represents one decan (l00) of the year. Their positions are determined with perfect Qabalistic logic, and they nestle neatly under the rulership of a King, or a Queen, or a Prince of their suit. I brought a couple of charts that I hope you can print with this interview to show this far better than I can explain it. Each of the 36 Small Cards (in figure 31, page 165) represents one decan (l00) of the zodiac: â¢ â¢ Figure 31. Each of the 36 Small Cards rules one decan (l00) of the Zodiac.

Wands are Fire and Aries is the cardinal fire sign of the zodiac. AT: As simple as that? LBC: As simple as that. And not only that, a planet is also assigned to each of the 36 Small Cards. Starting with 0Â° Leo (the 5 of Wands) , planets are allotted to the Small Cards in descending Tree of Life order. For your readers who are unfamiliar with the Tree of Life, I'll just tell you what that order is: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. You'll notice that Mars repeats itself at the last decan of Pisces and the first decan of Aries. Qabalists explain this by saying that at the end of winter and the beginning of spring the year needs an extra boost of Mars' strength to help usher in spring. (Hey! Don't blame me. I didn't invent the system.) Now can you see where the Small Cards get their traditional meanings? It's a combination of their Qabalistic and astrological attributes. The 2 of Wands is called Dominion because it is first and foremost a strong and fiery Wand, the suit of the Will; then it is a Two, the purest and strongest position in the Small Card sequence; then it is the first decan of Aries, the strong, aggressive and energy- filled sign of the zodiac; finally, the planet attributed to the 2 of Wands is Mars, and Mars is very, very happy to be in Aries. In other words-Wand plus Two plus Aries plus Mars equals \"Dominion.\" All the Small Cards aren't as obvious as the 2 of Wands, but I guarantee that if you carefully examine the suit, the number, the zodiac sign, and the planet attributed to each Small Card, you will eventually see why it bears its traditional meaning-why the 3 of Cups is Love, why the 6 of Wands is Victory, and the 9 of Swords is Despair and Cruelty. AT: Absolutely amazing. I guess I always thought the traditional titles were ... well ... traditional. LBC: Traditionally Qabalistic. Okay, I want to wind this interview up. I'm really hungry! I promised to talk about the four Princesses. These four maids are treated differently from the other twelve Court Cards. This stems from the Qabalistic doctrine concerning the exiled condition of the human soul. Now, when I say \"exiled\" I'm not referring to the old superstition about Adam and Eve getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden, and now we're all under some kind of bad ju-ju from an abusive creator. And I'm certainly not talking about that obscene and perverted doc- trine known as original sin. Whoever the ignorant, woman-hating, insecure, irrational, terrified, guilt-ridden, diabolical, self-despising horse's ass was who came up with that diseased and malevolent con- cept should have been thrown into the Nebuchadnezzar Institute for the Criminally Insane. The ridiculous belief that humanity could be cursed and condemned to eternal torment because mythological characters fiddled with the wrong fruit has caused more suffering and mental illness than any other \"religious\" or political concept in his- tory (coughing). It still amazes me that seemingly normal people-folks with pagers and computers-folks who call fill out their own tax forms and program their VCRs, can walk around and smile with this malig- nant spiritual tumor nestled deep within their otherwise intelligent brains. It's not only absurd, it's downright toxic! The story of Adam and Eve was originally written as a Qabalistic fable. It, and many of the other \"Holy Scriptures,\" were crafted to illustrate profound cosmological and spiritual principles. They were created by and for very smart and highly educated specialists in the field of spiritual literature. They are technical texts that were never intended to be consumed like horror comics, and then misinterpret- ed to further the ambitions of mean-spirited religious bullies (cough- ing) and others who just can't seem to (coughing) resist the tempta- tion to enslave the minds and the sex-lives of their fellow creatures (coughing)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"170 / CHICKEN Qb.BALAH CHICKEN TAROT / 171 AT: Rabbi, can I get you a glass of water? LBC: Thank you, please. It just gets me so mad. Sorry. Where were we? AT: We were talking about the Princesses. LBC: Right! Remember what I said abour four suits representing the four Qabalistic worlds, and that the human soul is a microcosmic reflection of this gigantic four-part reality? AT: Yes, and that the four Court Cards in each suit are further subdivisions of all this ... LBC: Correct. Now think abour the Court Card Kings as repre- senting Atzilurh (the Archetypal World), and, at the same time rep- resenting the highest part of each of our souls, the Chiah (the Life- Force); AT: Okay. LBC: Queens represent the second highest world, Briah (the Creative World), and our Neshamah (the Soul Intuition). Princes represent Yetzirah (the Formative World), and the Ruach, our Intellect; and finally, Princesses represent the lowest world, Assiah (the Material World) and the lowest part of our soul, the Nephesh (the Animal Soul). Follow me? AT: Why yes. Amazingly enough, I believe I do. LBC: Okay ... listen up. Assiah, the material world we see around us, is just the lowest vibratory expression of the universe. It is where the pure consciousness of Deity is so slowed down-so doped up- that it actually crystallizes. It is where light and energy become mat- ter and the invisible becomes visible. The Nephesh, the Animal Soul, is our own personal version of Assiah. It is the only world our Nephesh recognizes. From this extremely limited point of view, both Deity and you and me are trapped, exiled in a frozen prison of matter. We are a Princess who has forgotten her royal birthright. We have fooled ourselves into believing that Assiah is the only reality. We identify ourselves com- pletely with this lowest level of divine consciousness and the lowest part of our soul. But there is a way out-a way to escape the prison of matter and live in the bliss of the highest Qabalistic world. A clas- sic fairytale shows us the way. A Princess, a daughter of a King and Queen, is the victim of a magic spell and falls into a deep coma. A charming Prince (also the son of a King and Queen) sees the motionless perfection of this sleep- ing beauty and falls hopelessly in love with her image. Even though she is asleep (and unlikely to respond in kind) the Prince stoops down into her sarcophagus and kisses her. The pure love coursing through his lips is the magic that awakens the Princess. She is lifted from her tomb and marries the Prince, the act of which simultane- ously makes her the Queen and hirrt the King. That's where the fairytale stops, bur in the Qabalah, the new King then makes his new Queen pregnant. After doing this, he rolls over and goes to sleep. The Queen gives birth to twins, a Prince and a Princess, who leave the castle for adventures of their own. They get separated. She gets cursed-falls asleep-yada yada yada-we know the story from there. That's how Kings are made. If there were no Princesses-there could be no Kings. She may be asleep, she may be slumbering in the deepest forest, guarded by height-challenged mining engineers, bur without her redemption the old sleeping King will never reawaken, and the entire electricity of the universe will short-circuit. This two- way incestuous circuitry is the dynamo that creates and sustains the unrverse, AT: This is all very quaint, Rabbi, but how does it apply to ...

You are the King of the universe, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming he is the Queen, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming she is the Prince, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming he is a sleep- ing Princess. The first step in our return to our original state is to trick our own Prince into kissing us and waking us up. This is pretty difficult, but it's not impossible, because we've all got one of these Princes run- ning around in the \"more awake\" world. Even now, he's beating his fists against the lid of our glass coffin, trying to wake us up so he Can marry us and can get on with his career. Modern Qabalistic magi- cians call this Prince the Holy Guardian Angel and view the union with their HGA as the first step toward spiritual enlightenment. AT: How do we achieve union with our Holy Guardian Angel? LBC: You do it by falling head-over-heels in love with love. You do it by using your inner imagination to create the Deity in the image of your most ideal lover, and then surrendering yourself completely and unconditionally. Now this may sound uncomfortably like what Christians, and Buddhists, and Hindus tell you that you must do to their guys, and up to a point it is. But, no matter what they may tell you, no religion or creed can corner the market on this universal experience. It is totally universal and nonsectarian. It really doesn't matter what you call the object of your devotion, or how you visualize it. Anything and everything is capable of being the focus for your love for the Holy Guardian Angel. Now can you see why the Princesses are special? Like you and me, they are positioned at the lowest end of the elemental universe, but they also embody the foundation of the entire universe, and are the key ingredient in the great recipe of creation. Qabalists call the dream world of the sleeping Princess the Microcosm, or little universe. It is the world of Assiah and the Nephesh part of our soul.

Realization of the \"One\" is the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists. 2. The First Command-Rant is a lie-All is Nothing. The final goal is to attain consciousness of Nothing. 3. There really isn't a creation, time, or space, Heaven, or Earth . . â¢ but there is a you! Aren't you happy to hear that? 4. we perceive there is a creation, time, and space, Heaven, and Earth because of a fundamental defect in our powers of per- ception. Our faulty powers of perception keep us trapped In illusionary existence. 5. This defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome. How do we overcome this defect? 6. In order to overcome our defective powers of perception, we must be willing to abuse them until they break. Bingo! But this can be very dangerous. It may be true that every enlightened sage is insane, but it does not necessarily follow that every insane person is an enlightened sage! We must employ disci- pline, and strictly limit our techniques of self-abuse to fundamental observations of the illusionary world around us. These observations reveal to us that: 7. Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth. 8. Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth. 9. Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heaven and Earth. You are not likely to gain enlightenment simply by examining all the \"things\" in illusionary Heaven and Earth. But it is possible to achieve realization of the One (the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists) by a profound and transcendent awareness that you are an indispensable component of the connections, the reflections, and the patterns of the Supreme Being. IO. Look hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything. The object of your observation can be anything at all. Qabalists have learned, however, that some things reveal the Divine connection- reflection-pattern easier than others. Mathematics is the most profound example because it lays bare, to the tenacious student, the very structure of the universe. Language is another excellent tool for spiritual dissection because, by its very nature, it is a vehicle of connections, reflections, and pat- terns. Language evokes and transfers images from mind to mind in a manner not dissimilar to the creative fiat of the mythological gods of creation. â¢ â¢ â¢ Orthodox Qabalists believe that Hebrew is the most sacred of all lan- guages, and that the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are both the build- ing blocks of creation and the tools that put them all together. They believe the Holy Scriptures were divinely inspired and originally writ- ten in Hebrew to veil and reveal layer upon layer of ever-deepening spiritual truth. Certainly for devoted Jewish Qabalists this is the case, whether or not there is any historic validity to their belief or not. .As a Chicken Qabalist I have the greatest respect for the remark- able way parts of the Bible yield astounding treasures to the tinker- ing student.

This material remains the foundation of our study whether or not we choose to embrace any of the religious aspects of the work (and this, dear students, is what separates us from our orthodox brothers and sisters)-we are not Qabalists to prove the Bible is holy-we are Qabalists because everything is holy. Look hard enough at anything andyou will eventually see everything! Right now- right where you are, God is talking to you from the pages of the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas-from the funny papers, billboards, street signs, ticket stubs, and automobile license plates. We don't always have to be quick to tinker with the letters and numbers when we use the techniques of Gematria, Notariqon, or Temura. We are perpetually bombarded by countless numbers nes- tled within the billions of impressions we process each day. How many times a day do we write the date? What is 57 doing on a jar of pickles?We listen to the Top 40, watch the News at 7 and go to work by taking the 405 freeway to the 55 to the 5 to the 101. The ancient Qabalists didn't spend much time on the turnpike and probably didn't listen to the Top 40. What they did do was spend a lot of time studying the scriptures, and as the Tenth Command- Rant informs us, the scriptures are certainly as holy as a jar of pickles. As a matter of fact, the Bible is already crawling with numbers. Perhaps you'd like a better understanding of what Ezekiel was talking about in his famous vision? A clue might be found in the very first chapter and verse of his book. In English it reads: Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in thefourth month, in thefifth day of the month, as1 was amongthe captives by the river of Chebar, that the Heavens were opened, and 1 saw visions of God 1 I personally do not think it was important for Ezekiel to make sure we all knew the exact publication date of his book. I do, however, think that he wanted to make it perfectly clear that he might be writ- ing about something other than his psychedelic escapades with flying saucers, four-headed aliens, and dancing skeletons. In the first verse we find the numbers 30, 4 and 5, or the Hebrew letters ~-L, '-D, and M-H, or the Hebrew word M'~ which means \"birth.\" The second verse has a similar message: In the fifth day of the month, which was thefifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, we find 5 (M-H), and 5 (M-H) (duh!)-or the Hebrew word MM, which means \"window!\" A window is something through which we observe. It also permits light to enter. Birth, the result of penetrating light? Light pen- etrating where? The Book of Ezekiel sounds a little more intriguing now doesn't it? Take a peak at how chapter 8 starts out: And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as 1 sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. (Ezekiel 8:1). We find the numbers 6, 6, and 5. I couldn't find any significant words spelled VVH or even HVY; but when I put the three numbers side-by-side, I see the number 665 which is the sum of the Hebrew words CM,n M'I~, \"the womb,\" which certainly seems to carryon the theme that was started in chapter 1: verse 1. Light penetrating the womb which gives birth-gives birth to what? The 20th chapter may tell us. It begins with even more numbers: And it came to pass in the seventh year, in thefifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me. (Ezekiel 20: 1). Number 7,510? Well, we can really get bogged down on numbers that large, but if we reduce the 10 to a 1 we get the number 751, which is the sum of the Hebrew word for \"finished man\" or \"perfect man\": CM W'IM, or AYSh ThM. Thus, by investigating the numbers that are mentioned openly in these four verses, we find ourselves"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"186 / CHICKEN Q!.BALAH GAMES QABALISTS PLAY / 187 teased with the concept of Light penetrating the wombgiving birth to the Perfected Man. Was that the message Ezekiel was trying to convey? Probably not. But who cares! Whatever it was that the old boy was originally trying to say shrinks to insignificance. It is far more important to my spiri- tual enlightenment that my mind was forced to churn at breakneck speed to put all of this together, and then open itself up to the infi- nite potentialities of meaning. Look hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything! It doesn't even have to make very much sense what you connect to what. It's all ultimately connected! Don't you see? The Qabalah doesn't enable me to merely interpret what some- . body else meant to say; it forces me to hear what I need to hear! Each time I make another connection on paper, I am creating a new con- nection in my head (or perhaps reattaching a connection that was disconnected from the heads of our ancestors vast ages ago), and I am one step nearer to the realization that everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth. I'll now leave Ezekiel to the pizza cutter of your own wit. Time is short. I must push on with subjects of Gematria, Notariqon, and Temura, by which we can wring more truths (and Holy lies) from numbers and words. Please remember that these are not the only ways to warm up your cosmic translator, but they certainly are three classic, tried-and-true methods of the Chicken Qabalist. GEMATRIA Cernatria- is the process by which each letter of a word or series of words is converted to its numerical equivalent. Words yielding the same value are connected by their common numerical vibration and (on one plane or another) descriptive of each other. These correspon- dences are seldom obvious, and it is the student's quest to meditate upon the words and numbers until he or she achieves the level of con- sciousness in which the illusory contradictions are resolved. For example, The Hebrew word for \"riches\" and \"power\" is ~~, (DBA). The three letters add to the sacred number 7. Ifwe spell DBA backward, we get the word ,~~ (ABD) which means \"loss\" or \" . \" rum. While it doesn't take a rocket-scientist to realize that the oppo- site of \"riches\" and \"power\" is \"loss\" and \"ruin,\" the order and mean- ings of the individual Hebrew letters in these words tell a simple but profound story. The Hebrew word \"riches\" ~~, (DBA) suggests a door' to a house ~ or barn opening to enclose an ox ~ (an ancient symbol of wealth). However, the word for \"loss\" or \"ruined\" reverses the letters and suggests the ox ~ of wealth finds the barn's door ~ , and escapes. Or, to put it bluntly: Door + Barn + Ox = Good! Ox + Barn + Door = Bad! Another famous paradox of Gematria demonstrates that the Hebrew word for Messiah n~~ (MShYCh) and the word used to describe the serpent rum (NChSh) that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden both add to 358. Could this mean that the serpent might be the savior of the world, and the Messiah might lead us to damnation? Christians certainly think \"Jesus\" (mrui1~ = 326) is the \"Lord\" b~ = 32), and those two words together = 358 = Messiah. I bet they'd be surprised, however, to learn that every time they dutifully end their prayers in the \"name\" (cru = 340) \"Jesus\" (mt~m~ = 326), they are Qabalistically invoking 666, the number of the Beast of the Book of the Revelation, and for many, one of the scariest anti- Christian characters in the Bible. Could it be we really don't under- stand the meaning of either of these concepts and the number 358 might be our only clue? Now, I'm sure you're asking yourselves, \"How did Rabbi Ben Clifford know that all these Hebrew words added to these numbers?\" Well, you may not believe this but, in 1979, I took a few months off and rented a cabin in upstate New York, where I added up every Hebrew word in the Bible, a well as in all the major Qabalistic texts,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"188 / CHICKEN QABALAH GAM E 5 QA B A LIS T 5 P LAY / I H I) l\"1M (ChTh = 408) l\"1: (KTh = 420) l\"1i' (QTh = 500) ~Nn (ChATh = 409) tQNi' (QAT = 110) l\"1Ni' (QATh = 501) tQM (ChT = 17) tQ: (KT = 29) tQi' (QT = 109) tQNM (ChAT = 18) tQN: (KAT = 30) l\"1N: (KATh = 421) LAMED 30 + 1 + 40 + 5 + 4 = 80 BEN 2 + 5 + 50 = 57 CLIFFORD 20 + 30 + 10 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 200 + 4 = 282 = 419 Now 419 is a very interesting number. First of all, it is a Prime Number and cannot be divided by any other number but itself There are some pretty important Hebrew words that add to 419. The The numeration of the word changes, with variations in spelling offering us more food for thought and more opportunity for intel- lectual overload so coveted by Chicken Qabalists. As far as I'm con- cerned, all spelling is equally correct as long as it evokes a chain reaction of thoughts. The Chicken Qabalist should feel free to transliterate English letters and words using a broad assortment of methods. For example, if I change each English letter of my name to a logical Hebrew counterpart (a very un-Hebrew thing to do) we arrive at the number 419: As Hebrew doesn't use any vowels, \"cat\" can also be spelled with just the consonants: Some letters have multiple numbers because phonetically they can sound like other letters and those other letters have different numbers. For example, the English word \"cat\" could be spelled many ways using Hebrew letters. Just a few ways it could be spelled are shown below: Table 4. English Alphabet with Possible Hebrew Numerations and put them in my Rolodex. It's so big I have to keep it in the garage because my Mom says it's a breeding-ground for dust mites.> Table 4 is a quick and dirty view of English letters, their Hebrew counterparts and numerical equivalents.t LETTER NUMBER LETTER NUMBER A 1 or 70 N 50 (also 700 as a B 2 Final N) C 20 or 100 (if hard 0 70 or 6 like \"cake\") 60 (if P 80 (also 800 as a soft like \"cider\") Final P) Ch 8 (as in \"chief\" or Q 100 or 20 \"chug.\" Ch can also R 200 be pronounced the same as H) S 60 D 4 Sh 300 E 5 T 9 F 6 or 80 Th 400 G 3 Tz 90 (also 900 as a H 5 Final Tz) I U 6 10 J V 6 10 K 20 (also 500 as a W 6 Final K) or 100 X 90 or 8 L 30 Y 10 M 40 (also 600 as a Z 7 Final M)"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"190 / CHICKEN Q!\\BALAH GAM E S QA B A LIS T S P LAY / 1 9 1 But 460 is also a wonderful number (and a big number in tradition- al Judaism) because it is the sum of the letters of the words \"Holiness to the Lord\" (M'M~ ru'i'). These words were engraved upon a gold plate that the High Priest of Israel wore on his hat. My first name can further be reduced to the simple letter L (~), which, after all, is spelled LMD 'Q~ and rendered \"Lamed\" in English. I can also treat the \"C\" in Clifford as a \"Q/' and we get the following: word for the Hebrew letter Teth (.M~) adds to 419 . .M~ means \"ser- pent\" and all the wonderful and scary things that go with the idea of serpent. According to our Sepher Yetzirah, Teth is the letter of the zodiac sign of Leo. On the Tree of Life, Teth is the path that joins the fourth Sephirah, Chesed, to the fifth Sephirah, Geburah. In the Tarot, Teth is the Strength card. Wow! Isn't 419 a great number? But if we look a little deeper, we discover that the Hebrew words Sodom and Gomorah (M,QV C'C) also add to 419, and we know what the Bible tells us happened to those communities. Oops! Maybe I better spell my name differently. In more strict Hebrew, it might be spelled as follows: LMD 30 + 40 + 4 BN 2 + 50 CLPhRD 20 + 30 + 80 + 200 + 4 L 30 BN 2 + 50 QLPhRD 100 + 30 + 80 + 200 + 4 = 74 = 52 = 334 = 460 = 30 = 52 = 414 = 496 Here a very interesting number. Hebrew words that add to 496 include the great sea-devil Leviathan (j.M~'~) and Malkuth (.M'~~Q), the tenth and lowest Sephirah on the Tree of Life. Determining a word's number is only the beginning of the fun. Next we pick the number apart by every means known and a few that we will make up. For example: 496 is the sum of the numbers 1 through 31. (In other words, if 496 was a barrel of wine, 31 would be the brandy distilled from that wine.) Turning to one of our num- ber texts> we find that 31 has several entries. The two most impor- tant, in my opinion, are AL (~N) which is the simplest way to say God in Hebrew, and LA (N~) which means \"not.\" This reminds us of the first two Command-Rants; All is One, AL (~N) and All is Nothing, LA (N~). Say what you will about Islam, but Allah is a great name for God! There are no hard and fast rules about how you go about chasing one number to another. Go crazy. That's the ideal'' Feel free to break into other levels of correspondences. For instance: 496 = Malkuth, and on the Tree of Life it is 10, and represents the material plane. That means that 496 must also represent all things 10ish (after all 4 + 9 + 6 = 19 and 1 + 9 = 10). The Hebrew letter Yod enumerates to 10. Yod means \"hand.\" Using Hebrew for English, HA (NM) means \"this\" and ND ('~) means \"a skin bottle.\" Also, HAND (MN~') = 60. The number 60 is the Hebrew letter C (Samekh) which suggests the phallus (Oh my God! Thisskin bottle!) and when spelled in full is ,QC SMK, which enumerates to 120, which is the number of the word \"on,\" the sacred Greek word for \"existence\" and \"being,\"? and one of the most holy Egyptian words for Deity in the person of the Sun. See what we've done? Even this little excursion around Gematrialand has rewarded us with the provocative revelation that Yod, the creative hand of God, and the essence of existence and being, manifests as the Sun in out macrocosmic solar system, and also as the human phallus (this skin bottle, no less!) in the microcosmic material plane of Malkuth, the l Oth and lowest Sephirah on the Tree of Life-whose number is 496."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"192 / CHICKEN Q.,<\\BALAH GAMES QABALISTS PLAY / 193 What does this all mean? Who cares! You can see where this is all going, can't you? Like a mountain goat leaping ecstatically from crag to crag, one thought springs into another, and another, ad infinitum. You can continue, almost forever, connecting things that you never thought were connected. Sooner or later something's going to snap and you will overcome the funda- mental deject in your powers of perception. But don't expect illumination to come as the result of some par- ticular revelation concerning numbers or language. No, no, no, my children! Getting all worked up over those discoverieswill chase away your friends and ruin your social life. Your Qabalistic enlightenment will come quietly from the simple, but profound, realization that you are integrally connected to everything-just like these numbers and letters. Now let's move on to the techniques of Notariqon and Temura. They are really elaborations on Gematria because, in the final analy- sis, the number of the letter or word remains of primary importance. Let's look first at Notariqon. NOTARIQQN There are two kinds of Notariqon.f The first condenses a word, sentence, or a phrase into a more simple form in order to extract a more fundamental truth. The second method expands a word into a sentence whose component words are the initials of the original word. The former is the most commonly used, and is exercised by using. only the initials of the composite words to arrive at another word or number of significance. There are thousands of examples of this to be found in the Hebrew words and phrases in the Bible. Quite frankly, it's not really very impressive, because anybody can make most any- thing say most anything else. It all depends upon your personal or sectarian prejudices.\" The spiritual pay-off does not come from prov- ing a word is the perfect cryptographic definition of something else, but by breaking free of our day-to-day thought patterns and realizing that anything is potentially anything else. For our example, observe that the phrase, \"I did it Qn time,\" reduces to the word \"IDIOT.\" IDIOT = I (10) + D (4) +1 (10) + 0 (6) + Th (400) = 430 = Nephesh, the Animal Soul of Man. (Oh God! This is getting too easy!) The next form of Notariqon is a process that expands a letter, a word, or a sentence. For our example, let's continue the chain of ideas we started earlier and expand upon the letter Yod: Yod means \"hand\" and the word HAND can be expanded to revealAmerica's most worn out and meaningless blessing, \"HAVE A NICE DAY.\" But let's not stop here. When we expand \"Have a nice day,\" we discover that the individual letters of that nauseating mantra of insin- cerity expand into the delicious axiom of decadence: \"HEROIN AND YODKA BASE AGONY. NOTHING IS CERTAIN EXCEPT DEATH AND YESTERDAY.\" What does it all mean? Who cares! TEMURA With Temura.!\" letters are replaced by other letters. It is the classic \"secret code.\" There are infinite ways this can be done, so I will only show you a few. The most primitive form of Temura simply rearranges the letters in a word or phrase. Let's look at the phrase \"HAVE A NICE DAY.\" It can be rearranged to yield all sorts of pro- fundities. â¢ You may start your day with the simple affirmation- EACH DAY NAIVE â¢ Or coldly curse people by telling them to \"HAVE AN ICE DAY.\" â¢ You might suggest a dessert to your friend, \"HAVE A ICE,ANDY.\""},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"194 / CHICKEN Q!\\BALAH â¢ Or meet someone at the uncomfortable corner of HAY AND ICE AVE. â¢ Did you ever begin your prayer to David, the patron saint of outlaw motorcyclists?-AVE, CHAIN DAVE. â¢ Movie villains may ask, \"CAN A HEAVY DIE?\" â¢ What a stupid question.

Unfortunately, none of the above statements make any sense-but who cares! Look at all the unconnected things that got themselves con- nected. However, if we were dealing with Hebrew letters and words that have their own numerical equivalents and multiple definitions, we might find all sorts of entertaining and enlightening messages. The most common way Qabalists replace one letter with anoth- er is by utilizing a table called AIQ BKR, or The Qabalah of the Nine Chambers. See Table 5, page 195. Letters having the same single digit root [1-10-100], [2-20- 200], [3-30-300], etc.) are grouped together in nine chambers. The letter A can be replaced by I (or J or Y) or Q. The letter B can be replaced by K or R, thus the name AIQ BKR. The Hebrew word for \"bull,\" PR '1(280) could be replaced by the Hebrew word for \"bosom\" ChB ~n (10). The English word LID (34) conceals the word ShAM (341). The Qabalah of the Nine Chambers (Table 5) is particularly helpful for those Chicken Qabalists who dabble with Magick Squares. A Magick Square is really the numerical matrix of its parent Sephirah on the Tree of Life. In other words, Binah is the third Sephirah, and therefore is the Sephiratic expression of the planet Saturn. Consequently, the Magick Square of Saturn is a square 3 x 3. This follows right down the Tree of Life and right up the num- ber scale: the Magick Square of Jupiter (4th Sephirah, Chesed) is a square 4 x 4; the Magick Square of Mars (Sth Sephirah, Geburah) is a square 5 x 5; the Magick Square of the Sun (6th Sephirah, Tiphareth) is a square 6 x 6; the Magick Square of Venus (7th Sephirah, Netzach) is a square 7 x 7; the Magick Square of Mercury (Sth Sephirah, Hod) is a square 8 x 8; and the Magick Square of Luna (9th Sephirah, Yesod) is a square 9 x 9. These Magic Squares (see figure 39, page 1%) are filled with numbers-the same amount of numbers as there are squares in the Magic Square. Thus, the Magick Square of Saturn/Binah (3 x 3 = 9)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"196 / CHICKEN Q}.BALAH GAM E 5 QA B A LIS T 5 P LAY / 197 The numbers of all Magick Squares are ingeniously arranged such that the sum of the integer in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always the same. You will also notice that the numbers 1 through 10 and the num- bers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 are in bold type wherever they appear in the various Magick Squares. This is because these numbers also represent Hebrew letters. Qabalistic magicians have for centuries used these Magick Squares to create the sigils or signatures of angels and various other spiritual beings who personify various aspects of each individual Sephirah. These sigils capture the mathematical essence of the spirit. They can be used to charge talismans or amulets, or when drawn in the air with a magic wand, evoke and focus the spirit's energy. Obviously all the Hebrew letters cannot be represented by all the squares. Even the biggest square, that of Luna, has only 81 squares, completely leaving out room for the letters, Tzaddi (90), Qoph (l00), Resh (200), Shin (300), and Tav (400). The poor Magick Square for Saturn has only 9 numbers/letters to work with. How could I create the sigil for the bumbling nerd Angel named DORKAELll on the Saturn Magick Square?

I can find the 4 for 0 and the 6 for 0 and the 1 for A and the 5 for E, but what do I do for the R and the K and the L? 200 and 20 and 30 don't appear on the Magick Square of Saturn. Am lout of luck?

Because, at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what we've done, only that we did.

This is the creation of the world, that thepain of division is as nothing, and thejoy of dissolution all. -AIWASS I t is fitting that we end our study of the Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford with what I believe to be his greatest work, The Secret of Shem-ha-Mepborash. This tiny masterpiece was meticu- lously hand-printed on the back cover of his Games Qabalists Play notebook, and could very well be the last words he ever wrote. Shem-ha-Mephorash means \"divided name,\" and has tradition- ally been the subject of much Qabalistic speculation and discussion. Unfortunately, with the exception of his Secret of the Shem-ha- Mephorash, the Rabbi has left us with no written or recorded com- ments on the subject.' We have every reason to believe Ben Clifford wrote these words shortly after the abrupt and enigmatic conclusion of Games Qabalists Play and shortly before his disappearance. In my opinion, he had broken through, at least temporarily, to the level of transcendent illu- mination that he had worked so hard to achieve. I believe it was in the white-heat of this exaltation that he penned the last seventy-two words of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"God is.

For reasons which I do not altogether understand, many Jewish proponents prefer to treat the Q as a K and double the B when rendering the word into English letters. 3 Christian students prefer to spell it Cabala. 4 Ceremonial magicians prefer to spell it Qabalah. 5 Gershom G.

CHAPTER 1 1 See chapter 4. 2 See chapter 4. 3 The Rabbi's dogmatic attitude concerning the pronunciation of Hebrew words made him the target of ridicule from nearly all quar- ters of the Qabalistic community. Depending upon the dialect, there are, of course, many correct ways to pronounce Hebrew words. However, the point I believe Ben Clifford was trying to make is that, so far as the study of Qabalah is concerned, pronunciation is ulti- mately irrelevant. Arguing over it is a waste of precious time. By assuming this cavalier attitude, the Chicken Qabalist enjoys an exhil- arating level of spiritual freedom to pursue the more important aspects of the work. 4 See chapter 2. CHAPTER 2 1 See chapter 3. 2 See chapter 3. 3 It is a Qabalistic mystery of the highest order that the three letters, AIN (meaning \"not\" or \"Negative Existence\") when reordered ANI become the Hebrew word for \"I\" and \"Myself.\" 4 Ben Clifford's translation of the Sepher Yetzirah (see chapter 3) says: \"Deity ... created the Universe (with the help of three imaginary friends, \"Numbers, Letters, and Words\") in 32 mysterious paths of wisdom. They consist of 10 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.\" 5 At least I am real. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure about you. 6 Isn't this a recipe for madness?-Wake up! You're already crazy- and blind, deaf, and numb to boot! See chapter 10, Gematria, Notariqon and Temura-Games Qabalists Play. NOTES / 20.1 CHAPTER 3 1 Even the most respected translators of the Sepher Yetzirah admit that the source texts from which they worked contain internal incon- sistencies and other obvious evidences of severe corruption. Hermetic Qabalists of the 19th and 20th centuries (particularly the adepts of the Golden Dawn) freely adjusted certain planetary and zodiacal let- ter assignments to conform to modern and universally acknowledged astrological standards. Rabbi Ben Clifford's \"translation\" conforms to this modern tradition. 2 See chapter 7. 3 The Biblical translations here are obviously those of the Rabbi him- self, who worked from the standard Hebrew texts. 4 Editor's note: Ben Clifford claimed that when he was born, his mother, who at the time was a groupie with the Cliffy Eban Klezmer Band, was unsure exactly who fathered her child. She wished to name him \"El\" after God, but her colleagues cautioned her that to do so might be considered a blaspheme. Instead, she named him simply \"L,\" which in English is pronounced \"El\" and is rendered ~, Lamed, in Hebrew. 5 It might surprise you to know that traditionally the concept of God as a father is foreign to the ancient Jewish mind. Abraham was the father of the Jews, and the father figure to the Jews. In the Bible, Abraham never referred to God as father, neither did Noah, Moses, Elijah, Elias, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Jonah, Solomon, Ezra, or Nehemiah. In fact, in the entire Old Testament only two verses in the book of Isaiah and one Psalm of David make reference to the father- like qualities of Deity. 6 Qabalists are quick to point out that because the phrase c~rr~~ , Q ~ ~', \"and God said\" (literally \"and said Elohim\") appears ten times in the first chapter of Genesis, that the number 1 Â° is the key number of creation. 7 The Gospel According to Saint John, 1: 1. 8 The element Earth, like Malkuth, the lowest Sephiroth, is some-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"206 / NOTES NOTES / 207 what of a cosmic stepchild.

It is clear that the High Priest did not always die in a spectacular explosion. It is most likely, however, that it was expect- ed that he would be rendered unconscious by the act of touching the Ark and uttering the Ineffable Name. 4 Editor's note: Rabbi Ben Clifford is quite correct concerning the use of battle gods by ancient peoples. However, his reference here to monumental talismanic totem cheeses appears to be completely devoid of historic or traditional foundation. S Editor's note: Aaron's rod was a staff of almond wood that, at a very auspicious moment, miraculously bloomed. The Hebrew words for \"a rod of almond\" ('i'WM mQ~) enumerate to the prime number 463. The three Hebrew letters that enumerate to 463 are rl, Ci, and ~ (Tau, Samekh, and Gimel). On the Tree of Life (see page 43) Tau, Samekh, and Gimel form the middle pillar-the most balanced and direct path from material existence to supreme godhead-of which the human spine is the microcosmic reflection. Whatever material Aaron's rod was actually made of, it was described as being \"a rod of almond\" in order to communicate to anyone interested in how it worked. It is not unreasonable to speculate that a central rod (middle pillar) running between a positive current (the right-hand Pillar of Severity) and a negative current (the left-hand Pillar of Mildness) might be an object containing magnetic or electrical properties. 6 About 3 % feet (about 1.1 meters) long and 2 Y<I feet (about 0.7 meter) wide and high. 7 Also called an atonement cover. 8 About 3 3 ,4 feet (about 1.1 meters) long and 2 1,4 feet (about 0.7 meter) wide. 9 \"Then Solomon assembled all the tribes of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the chiefs of the fathers, to him in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of mM~ out of the city of David which is Zion .... And the priest brought in the ark of the covenant of mM~ to its place, into the temple, to the inner house, the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim ....

SHEM HA-MEPHORASH The Divided Name of God. The following copy comes from my book, Angels, Demons 6' Gods of the New Millennium. 1"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"218 / GLOSSARY One of the most impressive displays of Qabalistic gymnastics is an elaborate dissection of the Tetragrammaton called Shem-ha- Mephorash, the \"divided name.\" Based upon the four letters of the Great Name it is one of the finest examples of how Qabalists devel- op new ways of viewing the dynamics of the universe and identify the spiritual agencies who run the machinery. After exhausting all the tricks of Gematria, Notariqon, and Temura to harvest spiritual enlightenment from the Great Name, it occurred to some bright Qabalist to arrange the four letters in the form of a Pythagorean tetractys and adding the sum of the letters. ~ = 10 n ~ = 15 , n ~ = 21 n , n ~ = 26 It was decided that seventy-two is a primary expression of n,n~ and the key to an expanded (divided) name of God. Now, as there are seventy-two quinaries (groups of five degrees) in the zodiac, and each of those periods of five degrees represent approximately five days of the year, it followed that each part of n,n~'s divided name governed specific days of the year. This was an exciting prospect, for it promised the opportunity to more closely examine the Deity by translating the eternal and inscrutable aspects of creation into the familiar time-space language of Earth's yearly cycle. The next quest was to find the seventy-two names forming the Great Name. Turning to the Holy Scriptures it was discovered that three con- secutive verses (19, 20, 21) of chapter 14 of Exodus each contained exactly seventy-two letters. All that needed to be done was to Qabalistically play with these three verses until they yielded the 72 Holy Names. GLOSSARY / 219 It should be pointed out that these three verses are among the most significant and memorable of the entire Bible. Not only did they make Charlton Heston an immortal icon of American cinema, they narrate the story of a massive display of the Hebrew God's power manifested on Earth.

They consist of 10 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.\" The Tree of Life is usu- ally represented as 10 circular emanations (Sephiroth) and 22 paths to which the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are attributed. YETZlRAH- The Formative World: The second of the four Qabalistic Worlds; corresponds to the Vau of the Tetragrammaton; the element Air; and the suit of Swords in the tarot. In Yetzirah, the universal organization of Briah becomes specific, and a hierarchy of Angels with individual duties is established. This world is the Mind GLOSSARY / 221 and the Mind's Eye of the Deity. Yetzirah's corresponding part in the human Soul is Ruach-Intellect.
