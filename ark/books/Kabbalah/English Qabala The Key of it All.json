System of the English Qabalah By David Cherubim (Frater Aurora Aureae) Copyright © 1996 e.v. The Order of the Thelemic Golden Dawn. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. In Liber AL, II, 55, it is written in the Voice of our Lord Hadit: \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.\" The English Alphabet has 26 letters, whereas our traditional Magical Alphabet, the Hebrew Alphabet, has only twenty-two letters. The twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are linked with the twenty-two Paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life and with the twenty-two Atu of Thoth (Major Arcana of Ta rot). The 26 letters of the English Alphabet also pertain to the twenty-two Paths, which connect the ten Sephiroth on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, and also to the four secret Paths of the Ageless Tree, which also connect certain Sephiroth on the Tree. The order of th e English Alphabet, as indicated in verse 55 of Chapter II of the Book of the Law, pertai ns to the proper arrangement of the 26 letters of the English Alphabet on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Their value, as indicated in this same verse, denotes a new system of Numero logy. The new symbols of this same verse denote the four secret Paths of the Tree of Li fe, which, till this day, have remained hidden in the Sanctuary of Occult Wisdom. But the Tree of Life is incomplete without the addition of the four secret Paths, and therefore we must now expound upon these four Mysteries to make whole that which was partial. The making visible of the four secret Paths on the Tree of Life gives birth to a new Tree to accord with the English Alphabet, which is our Magical Alphabet for the New Aeon of Horus. This new Tree of Life, which incorporates the English Alphabet of 26 letters I am... Go Canada.

The sum of the numbers of 36 is 666, the Great Number of the Sun. Also, 36 is the Mystic Number of the Sephira Hod or the sum of 8, which is the number of Thoth-Hermes-Mercury, the Logos or Word of the Gods, and the Lord of Magick, Occult Science and Tarot. The 26 Paths of the new Tree of Life give us a new Major Arcana of Tarot, a set of \"new symbols\" or Trumps, which include four new Atu of Thoth, called \" Knowledge, Courage, Will, and Silence \" or \" To Know, To Dare, To Will, and to Keep Silence .\" These are the four Powers of the Sphinx, which are the O ccult Virtues of the initiated Magician. The four new Atu of Thoth are also linked with the four Worlds of the Qabalah (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah), the four Ker ubim or Holy Living Creatures who guard the Universal Sanctuary of Wisdom, and the four Thelemic principles of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty. They are also linked with the four Philosophical Elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth, whereas the remaining twenty-two Trumps of Tarot correspond with Sol, Luna, the eight Planets (Pluto, Uranus, Ne ptune, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) and the Twelve Astrological Signs (A ries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces). The four mysterious Paths, like the comm on twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life, connect two Sephiroth each. Thus one Path connects the two Sephiroth called Geburah and Chokmah, another Path connects Geburah and Kether, another Path connects Chesed and Binah, and another Path connects Chesed and Kether. From this it will be observed that a second Unicursal Hexagram can be formed on the Tree of Life, with Daath in its center, whereas the first Unicursal Hexagram contains Tiphareth in its center. Also, a second Pentagram can be formed on the Tree of Life with the application of the four secret Paths. The four secret Paths comple te the symbol of the Tree of Life, making it a perfect symbol of the Unity of All Things . These four Paths make perfect that which was an imperfect image of the Universe, giving birth to a whole new Qabalistic system of classification and thinking. 26, the number of letters and paths in our Thel emic Qabalah, is the sacred number of the Tetragrammaton or Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh (IHVH). The Tetragrammaton corresponds with the Four Worlds of the Qabalah. Our Englis h Qabalah contains the Mysteries of the Four Worlds. 26 is also the sum of the numbers of the Four Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar: 1 (Kether) + 6 (Tiphareth) + 9 (Yesod) + 10 (Mal kuth) = 26. The Middle Pillar is a Phallic Symbol of the Yechidah (True Self) and it is the Great Key to Initiation. Our English Qabalah contains the Mysteries of Initiation. 26 is also the sum of the numbers of the four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac, that is, Taur us (2), Leo (5), Scorpio (8), and Aquarius (11). These are the Kerubim, the Angels of the Elements from the point of view of Malkuth (Earth) or the Holy Living Creatures fr om the point of view of Kether (Spirit). These four Holy Kerubim are magically linked with the four mysterious Paths on the new Tree of Life. They are the Angelic Guardians of the Sacred Mysteries, Four-in-One and One-in-Four, that is, the Fourfold Nature of the Winged Sphinx of the Sun ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"English Qabalah: The Key of it All Page 3 of 23 http://thelemicgoldendawn.tripod.com/english.htm 10/22/2002 26 is the magical number of the Cube of the Sun. It is written in the Book of the Law that the Cube is a symbol of our Lord Hadit, th e Sun. The Cube has 6 sides, 8 points or corners, and 12 edges or boundary lines. The Cube contains the Great Secret of the Universe. In Alchemical terminology, it is the Stone of the Philosophers. The Cube is made of six squares; it is therefore linked w ith the Hexagram, the sacred symbol of the Sun. It is the Folded Cross of six squares which contains the Mystical Rose or Pentagram in its Center. The Rose is concealed in the C ube or Folded Cross; it represents the Secret of Secrets or the Arcanum Arcanorum of our Sacred Magick. By the unfolding of the Cube of the Sun is this Great Secret revealed; and the Cross and Rose, the Hexagram and Pentagram, become One in Eternity. Now one of the fundamental applications of our English Qabalah of 26 letters is to decipher and unveil the Mysteries of Liber Legis, particularly the Numbers & the Words of Liber Legis, II, 76 (4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L). This has been accomplished for the Order through the hand of Frater A.·.A.·. in \"Liber LXXVI: The Book of the Numbers & the Words\" (Official Publication of the Order of the T.·.G.·.D.·.). However, our English Qaba lah can be applied by any Thelemite to decipher the Numbers & the Words of Liber Legis in his or her own unique way. The work of Frater A.·.A.·. in this regard is a ma nifestation of his own True Will, or the fruit of his own Holy Guardian Angel, and it is but one form of interpretation. Other forms of interpretation of the Numbers & the Words of Liber Legis are made possible by use of our effective system of the English Qaba lah or by other unique systems of the same . There is no limit to the extent of the Qabalistic interpretations of Liber Legis . Just as there are infinite Stars in the Body of Our Lady Nuit, so are there infinite possibilities of meaning contained in Liber Legis and innumerable Qabalistic methods by which to extract these limitless meanings. The interpretations of Frater A.·.A.·. are specific to his own True Will and Office as Chief of the Thelemic Order of the Golden Dawn (Order of the T.·.G.·.D.·.). They do not represent a fixed or dogmatic explanation, but rather an individual version and demonstration of the e ffective use of our English Qabalah, which was first revealed unto Frater A.·.A.·. in 1990 e.v. during his Initiation as an Adeptus Minor or Adept of the Sun. Love is the law, love under will."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"English Qabalah: The Key of it All Page 4 of 23 http://thelemicgoldendawn.tripod.com/english.htm 10/22/2002 The Order & Value of the English Alphabet The order and value of the English Alphabet is simple yet profound in nature. The order pertains to the Paths of the new Tree of Life , which are linked with the 26 letters of our Thelemic Alphabet. The value of each letter is a multiplication of Six, the sacred number of the Beast (The Sun). 26 multiplied by 6 produces the number 156, which is the sacred number of Babalon (The Moon). The English Alphabet is the Magical Alphabet of the Sun and Moon . The value of the English Alphabet begins with the number of the Beast (The Sun) and ends with the number of Babalon (The Moon).

That is, words and/or phrases with the same numerical value can be related or linked with each other. For example, according to our system, the words English Qabalah produce the number 696, which is also the number of Thelemites and Key of it all (AL,III,47). The English Qabalah is the Key of it all for Thelemites, that is, for those who accept the Book of the Law and Thelema. The word Thelema in our system produces the number 384. So does the word Nuit . Thus Thelema is equivalent to Nuit. And, as a final example, the words Ankh-af-na-khonsu , Ra-Hoor-Khuit , and Double Wanded One , all produce the number 864. This requires no comment. It is enough to say here that our system obviously works! The words of our English Qabalah can also be linked with words from other systems through their equivalent numerical values. So, for instance, the Hebrew words ShMSh VIRCh (Sun and Moon) and AShT ZNVNIM (Woman of Whoredom) give us the 23 M 78 24 N 84 25 O 90 26 P 96 27 Q 102 28 R 108 29 S 114 30 T 120 31 U 126 32 V 132 33 W 138 34 X 144 35 Y 150 36 Z 156"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"English Qabalah: The Key of it All Page 6 of 23 http://thelemicgoldendawn.tripod.com/english.htm 10/22/2002 numerical value of 864 in the Hebrew Qabalah. The Sun and Moon and Woman of Whoredom can therefore be related to the words Ra-Hoor-Khuit , Double Wanded One , Ankh-af-na-khonsu , and Scarlet Woman , which all produce the number 864 by use of our English Qabalah. As another simple example, the word Babalon , by use of the Hebrew Qabalah, produces the number 156. By our system, the word God produces the number 156. We may thus freely interpret this as implying that Babalon (The Moon) and God (The Sun) are One. The possibilities are infinite! As a final note, the words listed below are mainly English, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Egyptian, Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic. This list of numbers and words is by no means complete and can be expanded upon by the serious student of our English Qabalah.
