A descriptive synopsis and introduction. The proposed monographic project, tentatively labeled Sefer‘Uzza wa-‘Aza(z)el: Exploring Early Jewish Mythologies of Evil , represents the first-fruits of a much larger ongoing research agenda focused upon the systematic collection and study of the use of apocryphal ‘books of Enoch’ traditions within Near Eastern religious communities dur ing the first fifteen hundred years of the Common Era. While the larger project em braces and ponders the existence and employment of a variety of Enochic materials (and w ill not be ready for publication for several more years), the present work deals wit h only one facet of these traditions; namely, the origin, conceptual development, and eventual refi nement in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam of at least four distinct mythologica l scenarios for the manifestation of evil in the created order. A number of previous contributions have studied some elements of these (or rival) schemes in isolation, but little compar ative work has been done to date, particularly across linguistic and religious boundaries. Sefer ‘Uzza wa-‘Aza(z)el aims to fill this gap in scholarship by (1) gathering together into one convenient location the most important texts which pertain to early Jewish construct ions of the emergence of evil, and (2) demonstrating how and why subsequent religious communities (Christian, gnostic, and Muslim) altered, adapted, and reshaped this traditional lore. After some preliminary remarks pertaining to terminology and the delineation of t he textual sources used in the study, the initial substantive chapter introduces what is arguably one of the earliest forms of the myth, a scheme which I label the ‘Enochi c template.’ According to this version, evil first enters the created world throug h the voluntary descent and subsequent corruption of a group of angels known as the Watchers. Their sexual contact with human women renders them odious to God and their former angelic colleagues in heaven; moreover, they also betray certain divine secre ts to their lovers and families. The offspring of the Watchers and mortal women, an illegiti mately conceived race of bloodthirsty ‘giants,’ wreak havoc on earth and force God to interve ne forcefully with the universal Flood. The corrupt angels are captured and imprisoned, t heir monstrous children are slain, and humanity is renewed through the family of Noah. Noticeably absent from this particular scheme are references to Adam a nd Eve, the garden of Eden, or the serpent—characters and motifs which belong to a separate schem e which I label the ‘Adamic template.’ A separate chapter will be devoted to the different forms of this ‘Adamic templ ate.’ Briefly stated, the scheme proceeds as follows: (1) God resolves to create the first human being, Adam; (2) after Adam’s creation, all the angels in heaven are bidden to wors hip him; (3) a small group of angels led by Satan refuse to do so; (4) as a result, this gr oup is forcibly expelled from heaven to earth; and (5) in order to exact revenge, these a ngels plot to lead Adam and subsequent generations of humans astray. As in the Enochic"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"template, their activities involve sexual awakening and the impartation or acquisi tion of a type of ‘forbidden’ knowledge. Once again God must intervene with a universal Flood in order to begin repairing the damage caused by this breach between Himself a nd a portion of His heavenly hosts. Bridging the gulf between the Enochic and Adamic templates is a ‘transiti onal template’ featuring two developmental ‘streams,’ the Jubilean and the Zoharic. Each of the se streams contains the main features of the Enochic scheme, but each stream also ex hibits motifs (objecting to God’s creative plans; instructional mission) linking them to t he Adamic type. I will argue that both the Jubilean and Zoharic streams represent subtle modifications of the Enochic template, modifications conditioned in part by the gradua l canonization of the Genesis narrative during the Roman period of Jewish history. Moreover, I shall also seek to show that texts including a ‘fall of Satan’ episode are invariably of Christian or Muslim origin. Subsequent chapters will focus on a small number of interesting motifs found in most or all of the narrative templates sketched above. One chapter will treat the rab binic testimonia to the infamous ‘generation of the Flood’ whose deeds were so vile that they were pronounced unfit for new life in the World To Come ( m. Sanh . 10.3). This generation corresponds to the semi-divine ‘giants’ of Enochic lore, and a comparati ve study of these two groups should shed much illuminative light upon the historical development of these now separate traditions. Another chapter or two shall be devoted to the explication of one curious female character who receives contrastive tr eatment (depending on the source used) in the evolving templates: the sister of Seth/the wife of Noah, who is sometimes presented as the virtuous maiden ‘Azura/’Asterah, and who sometimes figures as the wicked maiden Na‘amah/Norea. I also plan a cha pter that explores the various punishments handed out to the fallen angels and their allies, wherei n traditions regarding the possible postdiluvian survival of angels and giants will be thoroughly explored. A final chapter will gather up the various remnants of ‘fall en angel’ lore found in medieval Jewish and Islamicate literatures which have not receive d separate treatment in the preceding chapters. The proposed book possesses significance for several interrelated fields of huma nistic inquiry. A comparative study of the different early Jewish ‘mythologies of evil’ has yet to be accomplished, at least along the lines which I have sketched. New light should be s hed on the scribal circles responsible for producing these templates, as well as o n the ideological background of the final redaction of the early chapters of the biblic al book of Genesis, especially with regard to this redaction’s relationship to exta nt rival or alternative forms of constructing images of and narratives about the creati ng deity, the realms of angels and demons, and humanity. We should attain a better understanding of how certain interpretative currents in early Judaism were received, adjuste d, and manipulated by later biblically-based religious groups in the Near East s uch as Christianity, gnosticism, and Islam. We may also take some steps toward a plausible reconstruction of what may have been more primitive versions of the cosmologica l and ‘historical’ myths now found in Genesis 1-9.
