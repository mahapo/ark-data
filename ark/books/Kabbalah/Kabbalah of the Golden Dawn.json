If you have asked yourself these questions, perhaps the Kabalah will present you with answers and additional challenges as you travel the pathways to your ultimate goal. It is a tradition that is concerned with the transmission of the knowledge you seek. It is a most profound and effec- tive system of esoteric training when applied in a practical approach. This system of relationships among mystical symbols is used to open access to hidden parts of the mind, beyond reason; to learn the inner nature of man, the inner reality or essence of things. We determine this inner meaning based upon observance of the outer. In a more practical way, we are using the techniques and principles of Kabbalah as calisthenics of consciousness; to develop the power of the mind, to realize conscious energy, to reduce the Earth plane to order and harmony, to live in this world, continually evolving toward the light. Heaven is a state of consciousness and our purpose is to be more than what we are today, to have an experience that transcends \"our ordering self-awareness.\" The Golden Dawn System of Magic is based on Kabalistic theory.

Instead of escaping from the material world, the task is to bring it wholly into a state of balance and harmony-thus releasing one from material worries and enabling him/her to move to the next level of development. Alchemy is the transition from one state to another. This is an excellent way to describe what the student of magic or practical Kaballah is working to accomplish. Through these processes one is able to bring about changes on many different levels, which equate with the four worlds of Kabbalah: Physical: It is possible to retard aging, to heal, and to create evolutionary changes in the physical body. Mental: Through magic and the creation of changes on the astral plane one becomes the architect of his /her own environment.

Schol- urly interest has concentrated on the pervasive influence of the Order on II number of celebrated writers, but particularly on the poet, W. B. Yeats. There have also been a considerable number of books over the past twenty years which have covered the history of the Order in some detail and have progressively revealed its ritualistic and magical secrets. Despite this publishing phenomenon, there is still much that is unknown about the Golden Dawn. As Golden Dawn historian and author R. A. Gilbert has noted, the Order \"Yet remains as maligned, misunderstood and mis- appropriated as ever it was during its heyday.\" One area that has not received the attention it deserves is that of the Kabbalah, which was the basis of all Golden Dawn rites. The idea of writing a book on the Kabbalah from the perspective of the Golden Dawn is something I had considered for many years. My first attempt at R similar venture was in the Golden Dawn Correspondence Course, in which a very detailed study of the Kabbalah was made in the form of a series of tabulations. It was based on the Golden Dawn manuscript \"General Correspondences\" which Aleister Crowley subsequently mod- ified slightly and published as 777. While this course provided a great deal of original material, it did not cover many important areas of the subject. Originally I had intended to do a followup on the correspon- dence course, but due to an estrangement with the publishers, this did not eventuate."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn The subject of the Kabbalah itself is well documented but there are too few publications written from the occultist's viewpoint, which differs somewhat from that of the Hebrew traditionalist. There are some useful books of this type available however, and one of rhe best texts is Dian Fortune's Mystical Qabalah, though she worked only on the Sephiroth. Another is A. E. Waite's book The Holy Kabbalah, which is really a mon- umental and impressive piece of work. Waite's commentary on the his- torical gleanings and folio references in the Zohar proved invaluable in the preparation of this work. My own personal favorite, though, is the Kabbalah by Charles Ponce, who does a brilliant job of condensing the vast and complex history of the Kabbalah into a very fine little volume. Ponce went further toward the occult viewpoint than Waite, while still retaining the integrity of the traditionalist. My own work here, which is combined with the Golden Dawn view- point, takes things a step further toward the occultist's viewpoint. In many respects it is a Golden Dawn notebook on the Kabbalah, for it retains a num- ber of previously unpublished Golden Dawn texts on the subject, as well as later ones which have been pruned and presented together. When Regardie published all the Golden Dawn rituals (Llewellyn Publications), only the bare bones of the Kabbalistic papers were included for reasons of space. It is inevitable that there are some quores from previously published Golden Dawn ritual papers, but these have been re-edited in such a fash- ion, with additional footnotes, that most of this material will be seen as it was intended by the Chiefs of the Golden Dawn. In context, therefore, it is very much a new type of work and direction. Each Golden Dawn Temple had quite a number of lectures circulat- ing on the Kabbalah that were never part of the five basic knowledge lec- tures, and even these differed from temple to temple. From 1900, when the Golden Dawn split into the Alpha et Omega Temples under Mathers and the remainder, who changed the name to Morgan Rothe, 1 the Order still continued to function on the practical level as it had before. Thus over the years from 1900 2 to the present day, quite a lot of Kabbalistic texts were added by various members of the Order as more translations of the Zohar became available. This is German and roughly translated means Red Dawn. A further split in the Order developed in 1903. One group was called rhe Holy Order of the Gold- en Dawn under Waite and the other was called the Stella Matutina under Dr. R. W. Felkin."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction My own association with the Order came from ex-members of the New Zealand Temple Whare Ra. Under the tuition of my mentor Jack Taylor (a former Hierophant) I was given access to most of its documents. Some years ago, just before Taylor's death, I was given access to a large number of documents that had been the bases for lectures from Whare Ra on the Kabbalah since the temple's inception in 1912 to its demise in 1978. Most of these papers were undated (apart from the time that the lecture was given) and were partial translations of the Zohar from the French (apparently from the works of Pauly, Franck, Levi, and Papus) and from the Hebrew and Latin. In many instances the translations differ considerably from published texts, and where this is evident I have men- tioned it. The Zoharic quotes I have used are from these translations, many of which have only been translated into English for the general public in the last decade or so. Taylor informed me that most of these translations were done by the two former Golden Dawn Chiefs, Mathers and Westcott. Mathers' wife Moina also claimed that full English transla- tions of Levi's works were handed around the Order, some years before English translations became available. 3 What the Golden Dawn did, in essence, was to take the eyes out of the Zoharic teaching and present these in rituals and knowledge lectures. Many of the associated diagrams and explanations which were provided in the Golden Dawn were omitted from Regardie's first publication of the Golden Dawn material. In Regardie's subsequent work, Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic, the missing explanations are given only in part and these are still barely skeletoruc. These were of course taken from Rosenroth's works, that Mathers appended to the rituals. Many of the explanations given in this book are more complete than the rituals and are taken back to their original source, the Zohar. They are based on translations I uncovered here in New Zealand from various lectures on the subject given by Felkin and other Golden Dawn Adepts. What I have tried to do here is present, in one book, a synthesis of all major Kabbalis- tic teachings used by the Order, along with additional insight into the concepts they contain. I make no claim to be an expert on the tradition- al Kabbalah and its teachings, as my viewpoint is that of the Golden Dawn occultist and it is this viewpoint which is the basis for this book. J At Whate Ra I only found partial translation of Levi; the full ones were said to be left With Waite."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Kaballah of the Golden Dawn The part or volume number references to the Zahar, as given in the footnotes of this book, are modified from the traditional volumes to fall in line with the five-volume set of the Soncino edition, which is the more accessible of the English translations. I also noted that in the Son- cino edition, the emphasis on the Holy Hebrew Names of God and their variations are surprisingly ignored, where the Nurho de Manhar single- volume edition has these included, as well as some folios left out by the Soncino edition. The English translations of the Zohar to date leave a lot to be desired. Included in the section I have called \"Sphere of Sensation,\" is a breakdown of the functions of the Kabbalistic Soul as applied to subtle body anatomy, or the aura, as it is commonly called today. This section of the book covers some of the teachings from the 6=5 and 7=4 Grades of the Thoth Hermes Temple, in New Zealand. In this section there is a dis- cussion of the sexual teachings of the aura and its effect on the chakras and auric bodies. The theory was first outlined to me by Jack Taylor, in a rather general way, and I have taken the liberty of expanding ir a great deal, with a more technical viewpoint. On a final note, the reader may observe that one of the sections I have not covered in this work is that of the Tarot with regard to the Kab- balah. This is a work in itself and will be presented in a subsequent vol- ume called The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn.

There are many spelling variations of \"Kabbalah,\" including Cabalah, Qabbalah, Gabbalah, and so forth. As \"Kabbalah\" is that favored by authoritative Judaic scholars such as Gershom Scholem, Aryeh Kaplan, and the first Chiefs of the Golden Dawn, it is this spelling which is used throughout this book. The meaning of the term \"Kabbalah\" is usually related to the Hebrew root QBL meaning \"to receive,\" which is itself commonly taken to refer to the traditional custom of handing down secret knowledge by word of mouth to ear. Other scholars have claimed that the Hebrew word is of Chaldeo-Egyptian origin, signifying occult science or doctrine. Oral tradition has it that the Kabbalah was first taught to the archangels by God. These angels, said to be those mentioned in the Book of Enoch, then passed the secret teachings on to Adam (either directly or via Enoch, whom some identify with Adam). The teachings were said to been originally handed to Adam from the Archangel Raziel (whose name means \"secret of God\"), a personifi- cation of Secret Wisdom. The Secret Doctrine then passed on from Adam through to Abraham, who taught it (in part) to the Egyptians. The Kabbalah at this point did not form the main body of Hebrew 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn teachings but was a type of mysticism that had been held strictly apart from the main body of Hebrew theology, and as such, it was communi- cated only to a select few. This was because the teaching of the \"Hidden or Secret Knowledge\" was considered so profound that few could be trust- ed with its essence, let alone fully understand its complexity. To express this in terms that could be readily understood, this mystical teaching was said to have been allied to the Old Testament, and was applied to inter- preting some of the mote abstract Biblical passages. As to what this teaching was in its rudimentary form is almost any- one's guess save that it was mathematical in concept (based on a ten-stage system) and skeletonic in format. It is likely that it would also have required a system sufficiently flexible that could be applied equally both to the Macrocosm (the Universe) as well as the Microcosm (individual man or woman). At this stage one could safely say that general principles rather than detailed theories were the Kabalistic concepts of early years and these were deeply imbedded in the Hebrew religious thought and ideals of the period. Little is known of Kabbalistic thought and development between the time of Abraham and that of Moses. Kabbalistic scholars, such as Ginsburg, have hinted that Moses reinjected some of the lost or modified Kabbalistic knowledge of the Egyptians back into the Hebrew teachings (since Moses was said to be learned in the Wisdom of Egypt) during the Exodus. The Ten Commandments have been said to have been part of lost Kabbalistic theosophy and were given directly to Moses from God, so that the purity of the teaching would be retained. Each commandment was said to represent a stage of Kabbalistic development. TRADITIONAL HEBREW LITERATURE The Talmud This literature should not be confused with either the Old Testa- ment or the Kabbalah. It is a composition of the laws and customs of the Jews in both civil and religious doctrine. Based on a doctrine of interpre- tations of the Hebrew Bible, it is divided into two parts, practical and oral, the latter being the secret tradition of Israel which gave birth to the Kabbalah. The Talmud can also be further divided into two literature"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"An Historical Outline 3 sources. The first is the Palestinian Talmud which was compiled around the fourth century, and the second and largest is the Babylonian Talmud, I conceived about a century later. The latter is almost two-thirds larger than the former. The substance of the Talmud is divided into two parts, the MISH- NAH and GHEMARAH. The MISHNAH is a word relating to \"repetitions,\"Z-3 and signifying the methods of teaching. A large body of its teaching prior to the second century C.E. was compiled from earlier documents from the teachings of Rabbi's Hillel, Simeon, and Abba with the final draft by Rabbi Judah l larnassi in 220 C.E. 4 It was divided into six sections: 1. Prayer in relation to produce and crops and their preparation and prohibition (11 chapters). 2. Observance of festivals and food preparations thereon. This also includes days of abstinence and annual sacrifice (12 chapters). 3. Marriage and prohibitions. Engagements, divorce, and adul- tery (7 chapters). 4. Damages, buying and selling. General punishments. Advice to judges. Matters of idolatry and moral proverbs (10 chapters). 5. Holy offerings. Taxation. The 36 sins of death (11 chapters). 6. Purifications (12 chapters).

The Ghemarah was formed from the MEDRASHlM and TOSEPH- TOTH, and simply refers to the bulk of the additional teachings added to the MISHNAH The Kabbalah was said to have been hidden mainly within the first five books of the Pentateuch (written Torah or Law of the Old Testa- ment), though it is also said to be found in some other later biblical books. At this point we have the written Torah for the masses and rhe oral Torah which, in part, was said to have been kept for the chosen ones. When the correct key was applied Kabbalistically, over 600,000 different meanings and applications applied to rhe written Torah (it is assumed that since this number coincides with the number of Jews who traveled with Moses that each person could interpret a different meaning to the Torah). Tradition has it that Moses passed this Secret Wisdom of the oral Torah to 70 elders, which became the basis of Kabbalistic teachings for thousands of years to come. 5 Some of these notable authors ate Rabbi Eliezer (Jerusalem Talmud) and Rabbi Ashi and Rabbi Jose (Babylon Talmud). 6 See Cipher of Genesis by Carlos Suares (Shamballah, 1985), for an example of how exactly the hid- den ciphers within Genesis are utilized.

From the time of the incorporation of the Kabbalah into the Christ- Ian magic of the Renaissance. the importance of correctly writing Hebrew letters. along with the necessity of producing perfect diagrams and symbols, wasgiven major emphasis. The Golden Dawn was equally insistent on rhis requirement, and for this reason every Neophyte received a lecture on the Hebrew letters, rheir esoteric significance, and on the correct manner in which to draw the letters. The Neophyte was exhorted to become profi- cient in their execution and, of course, to learn them by heart. The Hebrew alphabet had seven main points of entry into Jewish lifestyle: Northwest Semitic Script. Cursive Script. Square or Rectangular Script. 7 See The Hel7rew Scripts by S. A.

This developed into the Phoenician around 1100 B.C.E.,8 and then into Aramaic in approxi- mately 900 B.C.E. The Hebrew script and alphabet from this point on developed independently of the Aramaic script. In the second century B.C.E., a further development of the Aramaic script was to square the let- ters, which the Jews adopted. It was around the second century C.E. that the letters started to appear with thick and thin bars in some type of polarization. It was not until at least the 6th or 7th century C.E. that the full Hebrew letters as we understand them today were finalized. The iso- lation of the Jews after the destruction of Jerusalem around 70 C.E. also had a great deal of effect on the different variations of script with each area, whether it be in Spain or China, having a distinct style of its own. 9 The numerical system applied to the Hebrew letters was no doubt adapted from Greek origins. The first nine letters were for single units, while the next nine were for double digits, and the last for units of three digits.

W. Felkin. Though undated, I would place it about 1923. It is based on the work Hebraic Tongue Restored by Fabre d'Olivet, first published in English in 1921. In studying the actual letters as we now possess them, we must of course admit that they have undergone a considerable modification since the days of Moses, the most important being their approximation to the Chaldean, owing to exile. From the Chaldean also was borrowed the vocalisation system by means of points placed above, below, or within a letter. Nevertheless, the hieroglyphic idea is retained in that each letter represents not merely a sound, bur also an object, and the name of the letter is also the name of the object. Aleph (Arabic Alif) not only means the letter A or E (or more accurately, the opening of the mouth to make a sound); it is also the name of an Ox. The word Beth is not only the let- ter B, but it is also the name of a house. There is another thing you have to bear in mind. In all ancient languages there was only one system of notation for both sound and number. Therefore, each letter is also a number, and each word has a numerical value equal to the sum of its numbers. Thus AL is not only a sound and a Divine Name. It is also 30 plus 1 = 31. Moreover, a language like Hebrew had comparatively few words, but each word had numerous shades of meaning, indi- cated either by the context or the inflection, and also each individual letter had its own essential meaning. Therefore it follows that the word was the sum of or modification of those meanings, just as numerically it was the sum of those individ- ual numbers. Thus AL, which signifies the number 31, is formed from Aleph, the sign of power, and from Lamed, the sign of extension. Its spiritual meaning is therefore \"Extended Power,\" and hence God, the Power extended over all. Used in a restricted or materialised sense it may be translated as \"towards, against, upon.\" The same letters reversed, LA, repre- sent spiritually the prolongation of movement to infinity, which translated upon a lower plane becomes a negative and may be rendered as \"no, not.\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet Now let us consider the abstract symbolism of each of the 22 Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet: 1. Aleph (Ox) is the sign of power, stability, Unity. It represents mankind as the ruler of earth. 2. Beth (House) is interior action. It represents virility, and an interior dwelling place. Unite these two letters and you have AB or ABA = Father. 3. Gimel (Camel) is the sign of organic development, hence the throat, or a canal which organises or controls inflection or sound, a glass of water. 4. Daleth (Door) is the sign of abundance from division, divisible nature, the source of physical existence: the breast, source of nourishment. 5. The letter Heh (Window) merits special attention. It is the symbol of Universal Life, the breath. It may be translated as either E or H and is closely akin to Cheth in meaning as well as form. It is frequently used as an article, and may be translat- ed as \"the, this, that, of.\" In this respect it is used as a prefix or an affix. It forms, when united with a vowel sound, the princi- ple Deity names, and in this aspect it indicates an abstraction which no modem language can render adequately. Thus YH is Absolute Life, Eternal, Immutable. AHIH can be adumbrated as \"That which Is-Was- Will be.\" It is the root of the verb \"To Be, To Exist\" and is used to denote the source of human life in the Name HIH which we translate as EVE, but which also may be given as HUA, the third person singular of rhe verb To Be, or simply HE. When the significant Yod is added it becomes TETRAGRAMMATON- YHVH, the Inviolable Name which must not be taken in vain and which was only intoned by the High Priest upon entering the Holy of Holies. Even today, no orthodox Jew attempts to utter it. 6. Vau (Pin or Hook) is a letter equivalent to 0, U, or V. It is therefore convenient to use the point to indicate the sound since its symbolism differs widely according to its pronuncia- tion. As a V, Vau is used as a conjunction and is placed at the beginning of a word; it may be translated as, \"and, also, thus, then, afterwards,\" but it links words together more intimately than any of these. Used as a vowel (U or OU), it is a sign of action, and has the peculiarity of transforming a verb from the present to the past or from the past to the future. In these 9"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn aspects it no longer represents the junction of two things (as a hook, eye, knot, or link); rather it is the symbol of light, sound, air, wind. Hence RUCH \"the wind, breath or soul,\" because Resh is movernent., Heh is life and Vau in the midst gives the peculiar human character to the word which indicates \"expan- sion, inspiration.\" 7. Zain is a hissing sound of something passing through the air, hence a sword or arrow, javelin or spear. It also denotes the refraction of light, suggesting the dazzling appearance of a ray of light falling on polished metal. It may be transliterated as the letter Z. 8. Cheth (Fence, Enclosure) is a letter closely allied to Heh, both in form and in significance; but as it is more closed in form so it can be more guttural in sound and of a material connota- tion. It signifies life, but on a lower plane. It implies effort, labor, care. Thus in concrete example it indicates a field, an enclosure upon which labour must be expended. 9. Teth in its hieroglyphic form shows a coiled serpent protecting her eggs, hence the universal tradition of the serpent guarding treasure. From that we get the idea of a shield, shelter, a roof protecting man's family as the serpent protects her eggs. Final- ly a haven, refuge, or goal. 10. Yod is another letter of profound symbolism of deep signifi- cance. The hieroglyphic interpretation is that of a hand, but a hand held out in action, thus the symbol of creation. It is a sym- bol of the flame detached from any material base, free, the leap- ing creative impulse. By a natural transition we get the phallic symbol of creative power. On the abstract spiritual plane we have the Divine Creator. From this letter transmutes HUH, the feminine source of life, into YHVH-the Ineffable Supreme. 11. Kaph hieroglyphically represents the closed or half closed hand, a fist: hence the hollow, therefore a receptacle: the power of assimilation, reflection, meditation. It forms a link between Cheth, the sign of manifest life, and Girnel, the sign of organization, and carries in itself something of the symbol- ism of both of these. Used as an article of preposition it may be translated as \"similar, according to.\" Vocalized by Yod it signi- fies KY, \"because, for, then, when.\" 12. Lamed in a material form suggests any form of an extension, the outstretched arm of man, the unfolded wing of a bird, hence the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet further symbolism of the whiplash or ox goad. But when these interpretations are raised to the spiritual plane we perceive at once how significant this letter becomes. It therefore represents an Extension of Power, omnipotence. Hence ALHIM (Alohim) is the extension of the Power of Life to the nth degree, the aspect of the Divine which is capable of creating without effort. Conversely LA signifies an indefinite, and therefore unknown and incalculable, quantity which brought down from the abstract to the concrete becomes negation, \"no, not.\" 13. Mem is the sign of plastic or passive action; the genuine pro- tective aspect of creative power. Hence vocalised as MEM it signifies water, always used in the plural since the Final Mem is collective as water is the condensation of moisture. With the letter Shin prefixed we get ShMIM (SHAMAIM), the Heav- ens, the ethereal water or atmosphere. Used as an article or prefix, Mem may be rendered as \"from, out of, with, among.\" Hieroglyphically we may say that Mem indicates rough water, sea waves, while Mem Final suggests rather still, calm water, silence, or peace. 14. Nun shows an image of produced or reflected existence, off- spring, fruit, or child; hence it represents hieroglyphically a fish, the inhabitant of water. Joined to Beth, the sign of interi- or action, it becomes BN (Ben-Son). This is more clearly defined when we realise that Nun Final is augmentative and emphasizes the individuality. Nun at the beginning of a word suggests passive action, contemplation folded in upon itself. Nun at the end of a word is the converse, unfolding. Thus NB represents inspiration, prophecy, ecstacy. From this is derived NBIA, a prophet. 15. Samekh represents the development of the hissing sound of Zain, so hieroglyphically it is a duplication. The duplicate link forms a prop, not merely joining but supporting. It is the image of all circular and spiral movement, possibly a deduction from rhe peculiar movement of the serpent. 16. Ayin, hieroglyphically, signifies an eye, and here we must find one of the most curious and erudite survivals of occult knowl- edge. Superficially, there seems to be little likeness between the letter and the symbol. When we come to consider it more carefully we find that it is indeed an extraordinary gift of the organs of vision. Externally we have two eyes (shown by the two Yods at the top of the letter), but inside our head lies a 11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn small body, one (or rather two closely connected) of [the] so- called \"ductless glands\" of modem physiology-the pineal and the pituitary glands. These glands are connected with the external eyes by delicate nerves, as when the external eyes are exercised in certain methods they awake a definite response in the internal gland-the \"third eye\" of legend. The complete letter is an exact counterpart of the complete organism and signifies the whole visual apparatus. One of the secondary results is the reaction upon the general muscular system. Phonetically, Avin represents the opening of the glottis (in the throat to make a guttural sound), and therefore it is transliterated as AA - 00 - WH or NO. Thus it symbolizes [an] interior hollow sound or noise and connotes materialism or emptiness, sometimes falsity or perversity. It is the physical aspect ofVau, and when used as a consonant almost always has an evil implication. 17. Peh as a hieroglyphic of an open mouth, naturally symbolizes speech. It is transliterated as either P, in which case it closely resembles Beth in meaning as well as form, or as PH, in which case it approximates rather to the meaning of Vau, 18. Tzaddi represents all ideas of severance, solution; concretely it represents the hook by which something may be caught or ended. In sound it falls into the same group as Zain and Samekh, though it is harder and more abrupt. Placed at the beginning or words it indicates the movement which carries us on towards an end. Placed at the end as Tzaddi Final, it indi- cates us on towards an end. On a much higher plane it repre- sents a refuge for man. 19. Qoph is a letter that has a guttural sound like Ayin which sug- gests its materialistic tendency. Hieroglyphically it represents an ear. Symbolically it becomes an implement or instrument by which man may accomplish an act or defend himself. It marks at once, force and restraint. It is significant of repression and decision. In sound it is the harder and more guttural sound of Kaph. Abstractly we may trace a regular succession of descent and. development. Thus Heh-Universal Life, pure being; Cheth the Life of nature, Manifest Existence. Kaph assimilated Life holding natural form and Qoph, material exis- tence giving the means of form. 20. Resh is the letter par excellence, the sign of movement.

The creative elemental fire, the renewal of all movement, the perpetual vibrations building up matter.l'' Hence the word AUR-fire, action, contrasted ASh with potential fire. 21. The letter Shin represents teeth, by which its sound is pro- duced. It completes the symbolism of Zain and Sarnekh and is in a sense bound to them, for Zain is an arrow and Samekh the bow string, so Shin symbolizes the bow itself. Hence we are told that the Three Paths of the Tree of Life form QShT (Quesheth) the Bow,11 the material sign of reciprocity between God and man. Shin is the symbol of movement and duration. Used as a prefix it indicates a double power of move- ment and of conjunction. It may be pronounced either SS or SH and it usually has a point above it to indicate which of the two sounds is to be used. Geometrically it represents the semi- arc of a circle whereas Resh is the straightforward movement of a radius and Samekh a spiral. By analysis we find that the Divine Name SHADDAI represents the oversearching heav- ens protecting the fecundity and abundance of nature-hence Providence. 22. Tau is the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and represents a glyph of the cross, the name still retained to indicate the ancient form of the cross-the tau, sacred to THOTH. It is probable, indeed, that the letter was originally written in the form of a modem T and was gradually elaborated to distin- guish itself from Daleth. It is the sign of reciprocity, of that which is mutual, interchanging, sympathetic. Joined to the first letter of the alphabet it indicates ATh-the essence, the innermost self of a thing or person, and in this form it is repeatedly used by Moses as a prefix in his account of creation to indicate that he is not describing a material or individual, but essential process which developed on a higher plane pre- liminary to any physical manifestation.

Hamphoresch or the Divided Name By the time an aspiring Golden Dawn member had reached the Grade of Philosophus, which corresponds to the Sephirah of Netzach on the Kab- balistic Tree of Life, he or she was permitted to study a manuscript called the Schem-hamphoresch. 12 It cannot be denied that this is a difficult paper, lind one which concerns the deepest secrets of the Kabbalah in general, lind of magic in particular. It is probable that, apart from the most gifted und dedicated members of the Order, few were able to utilize it correctly. Even the novice magician, however, is aware of the importance ascribed In Kabbalistic magic to the Holy Name of God in the Jewish tradition, the Tetragrammaron-i- YHVH. As the Jews were forbidden to utter this name, except in rare ritual circumstances, over the course of some 2,000 years the true pronunciation has been 10st 13 and it was subsequently II This rext is not to be confused with that of the same name that was published by Andrew Luppis in 1686 in Wesd, Dulsburg, and Frankfurt which is an inferior work to the one given here.

The ultimate aim of the Jewish mystic, or the Golden Dawn magi- cian for that matter, was to attain to union with the source of all creation, the Lord of the Universe, or God. One of the ways to achieve this lay in the correct invocation of one of the God's names. Even in lesser magical or spiritual workings, the invocations of divine and angelic names was of crucial importance. For this reason the aspiring magician gave a great deal of study to the many arcane teachings involving the name of God. One such teaching was the SchemHamphoresch document. \"Schem-hamphoresch\" is sometimes termed \"The Complete Name,\" meaning that it includes all other names, each of which, by itself, is pur- ported to express some one particular aspect or another of the Divine universal principle, namely, God. The following paper is an abridged version written by Mathers for Golden Dawn members: This refers to the 72 Names derived from the Four Letters of the name of YHVH. Four is the number of letters of ADNI which is its representative and Key.14 The latter name is bounded with the former and united thereto, thus IAHDVN- HY, forming a name of 8 letters. Eight multiplied by 3 (the number of the Supernal Triad) yields the 24 Thrones of Wis- dom, the 24 Thrones of the Elders of the Apocalypse, each of whom wears on his head a Golden Crown of 3 rays, each ray of which is a name, each name an Absolute Idea and Ruling Power of the Great Name YHVH- TETRAGRAMMATON. And the number of the 24 of the Thrones multiplied by the 3 rays of the Crowns = 72, the Name of God of 72 letters, which is thus mystically shown in the name YHVH as under; or as the Book of Revelation says: \"When the living creatures (the 4 Kerubi, the letters of the Name) give glory, etc., to Him, the four and twenty Elders fall down before him, and cast their Crowns before the Throne, etc. (that is, the Crowns which each bear 3 of the 72 names).\" And these 72 names are written on the leaves of the Tree of Life, which were for the healing of the nations. These are also 14 Mathers is referring to the fact that each of the 72 angelic names fonned is related to a specific bib- lical verse which has the name YHVH in it, from Psalms. A Hebrew Bible is necessary for this process, but its verse numbers do differ from those given in rhe English Authorized Versions."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Shem-Hamphoresch the 72 rounds on the Ladder of Jacob on which the Angels of God ascended and descended. It will presently be shown how the 72 angels' names are formed from the 72 Names of the Deity, and also how their signification is to be found. The 72 names of the Deity are thus obtained: The 19th, 20th, and 21st verses of the XIVth Chapter of the Book of Exodus each consists of 72 letters. These are the verses.P 19th Verse \"And the Angel of Elohim which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the Pillar of the Cloud removed from before them and stood behind them.\" 20th Verse \"And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet it gave light by night, and the one came not near the other all night.\" 21st Verse \"And Moses stretched his hand over the sea; and Tetragrarn- maron caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all the night, and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided.\" These three verses are now to be written at length, one above the other, the first from right to left, the second from left to right; and the third from right to left; and as they each contain 72 letters, there will be 72 columns of three letters. Then each column will give a word of three letters and there will be 72 names of three letters each, which are the SCHEM- HAMPHORESCH, or the 72 names of the Deity expounding the Powers of the Name YHVH. From these 72 names, 72 names of the Angels are formed by the addition in some cases of the name YH, which signifies Mercy and Beneficence, and in others of the name AL, which signifies Severity and Judgement. As it is said \"And Thy Name is in Him.\" These 72 angels rule over the 72 Quinaries,or sets of 5 degrees of the Zodiac, and therefore each Dccanate or set of 10 degrees of a sign has 2 Quinaries, and each sign has 3 17 U To obtain a clear picture of how thts is done it is necessary to obtain a Hebrew translation of these verses."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"18 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn Decanates, which are again allotted to the Planets in regular Order.

The first division of the 3 Signs is under the Presidency of YOD, the letter of Fire, headed by the Fiery Sign Leo.

It is also believed by the majority of Kabbalists that the book can originally be ascribed to Rabbi Nechunjah ben Hakana (around 75 B.C.). As such it is considered to be the very earliest Kabbalistic document. One of the founding Chiefs of the Golden Dawn, Wynn Westcott, made a deep study of the Bahir, and in 1896 he produced a translation under the title Book of Brilliance. There is little doubt that the concepts of the Bahir, like those of the Zohar or the Hekaloth texts, were applied by Westcott to the Sephirotic and Kabbalistic schemata of the Golden Dawn. Because many concepts of the Bahir are expanded upon in the Zohar (as published in Rosenroth's translation), some have considered the Bahir II. For English translations see Bookof Brilliance, translated by Wynn Westcott (privately printed. (896), and The BahiT. translated by Rabbi Kaplan (Weiser, 1979).

The Bahir consists of a series of discourses which have been com- pounded into roughly 30 brief pages, though the length of it seems to vary with the various editions. The various Hebrew teachers mentioned in the book include Rabbi's Akiba, Elizer, Rahaumai, and Berachai. The discus- sions in the Bahir are less sophisticated than those of the Zahar and give brief hints of things expounded more fully in the 2ohar. In many instances reading the Bahir first and the various relevant texts in the Zahar, where more in depth information is given, one can trace a gradual development of the concepts. The Bahir really appears to be the basic essence on which the 20har proper was built, and as such, is a text of prime importance. The Bahir can be broken down into the following seven divisions: 1. Expounds the theory of Creation. The statement given here by Rabbi Nechunjah seems closely allied to the Chinese Taoist view of cre- ation, as defined by Lao Tzu: There was something formlessly fashioned, That existed before heaven and earth; Without sound, without substance, Dependent on nothing unchanging, All pervading and unfailing, One may think that it is the Mother of all things under heaven, Its true name we do not know.2 4 Following Nechunjah's statement, Rabbi Berachiah says that Chaos was always there, a belief that also echoes that of the Chinese Tao, or Dao as it is now called. It is a point that does not so much relate to creation as such, but more importantly refers to the transmutation of substance. At this point the importance of the Hebrew letters are brought into close scrutiny, such as the letter Beth being the first letter of the word Bereshith-Genesis. 24 Tao Te Ching."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Early Books 39 2. Gives explanations of the formation of the first eight letters of the Hebrew alphabet from Aleph to Cheth. When compared with the later Zohar there are vast number of differences regarding the esoteric signifi- cance of the formation of the letters. It is obvious that we are looking at two periods of development of the Hebrew letters when comparing their etymological origins. Rabbi Kaplan, in his translation of the Bahir, solves part of this problem by associating the descriptions to the Ashur type script, whereas the Westcott translation uses a later script. 3. Shemhamphoresch, name of 72 letters. 4. Discussion of the Seven Voices as heard by Moses on Mount Sinai. This relates to the manner in which the Torah was given to the jews. 5. Descriptions of the Sephiroth, which are given for the first time. It is thus, the hands have ten fingers, relating to the ten Sephiroth with which both the heaven and the Earth were sealed. 25 Though the Sephiroth are not named directly in the Bahir, notes made by both Westcott and Kaplan in their translations more than ade- quately explain some of the hidden references to them. 6. The functions of the Kabbalistic Soul. Although not as sophisti- cated as that found in the Zohar, the concept of the formation of the Soul is given, showing that both the male and female souls develop from each other. 7. Within the Bahir there is also a reference to what could possibly be described as the practical part of Kabbalism, insofar as it speaks of the making of a Golern/? by Rabba. lS Westcott translation. 10 The Golem was a man made of clay who was brought to life by Kabbalisric meditations and ritu- als.

These tell how his own teacher took him on a journey of the Heavenly Palaces, and of the visions he experienced there. The actual structure and formation of these palaces will be discussed in later chapters, but the framework from which they developed is very important. Generally the name \"Merkabah\" (Chariot) denotes the method, whereas the name \"Hekhaloth\" (Heavenly Palaces) refers to the place they visited, but over the years the two names have become confused with each other. The Lesser Hekhaloth text is such an example, as it is more concerned with the Merkabah itself.z7 One of the most interesting aspects of this manuscript from the occult viewpoint is the section on angelology. This gives definitions and functions not only of various angelic choirs, but of individual angels as well. Like the Bahir, the Lesser Hekhalorh text shows yet another stepping stone to Kabbalis- tic associations through the seven heavens. The content of the Greater Hekhaloth is more in line with the title, providing details of additional Heavens or Palaces that the earlier Hekhaloth texts did not include.i\" A further Hekhaloth text is the Bibli- cal Book of Enoch which most Christian churches have not deemed as \"inspired.\" Considering the contents, it is not surprising, though most Biblical scholars firmly connect the book with pre-Christian times.2 9 Part of the Merkabah vision is the use of certain symbols to enter various spiritual or psychological levels'S' (which we will call \"heavens\" for the sake of argument). This is not unlike the \"Book Of Pylons\" from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and one wonders whether or not this method- ology was part of the teachings Moses brought with him from Egyptian learning. The application of putting any visionary experience to the test 27 See Odeberg's \"Enoch 3\" in which the Lesser Hekhalorh text is given. Scholars such as Scholem have considered it 3rd century and a corrupt manuscript. It appears though that this manuscript in Its original form was l st century, since it concerns the teachings of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, but was possibly added to by other authors over the centuries. Scholem's \"Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Traditions.\" 28 instead of Seven Heavens, the Greater Hekhaloth relates [Q Seven Heavens in each Heaven. 29 Also see \"Secrets of Enoch\" in Forgotten Books of Eden which some have considered as being Isr century.

Apart from the experiences of Enoch, the next most important experience allotted to Merkabah is the Vision of Ezekiel. A more modem viewpoint would term this an exploration of \"Innet Space\" in which the Kabbalist through special meditational techniques attempts to go through a series of projection workings where his visionary expressions accord with his teachings. These various archetypes, of course, varied from individual to individual, but since they were confined within certain belief structures many similarities between the visions would occur. This Inner Space concept was taken further by Golden Dawn Adepti who adopted the Merkabah concept to suit their own spe- cial needs, as shown in the following lecturer'! The symbol, place, direction, or Plane being known whereon it is desired to act, a thought ray is sent to the corresponding part of the Sphere of Sensation of the Nephesch.V The thought ray is sent like an arrow from the bow, right through the circumference of the Sphere of Sensation direct unto the place desired. Arrived there, a sphere of Astral Light is formed by the agency of the Lower Will, illuminated by the Higher Will, and acting through spiritual consciousness by reflection along the thought ray. This sphere of Astral Light is partly drawn from the surrounding atmosphere. The Sphere being formed, a simulacrum v of the person of the Skryer is reflected into it along the thought ray, and this united consciousness is then pro- jected therein. This Sphere is then a duplicate by reflec- tion, of the Sphere of Sensation. As it is said, \"Believe thyself to be in a place and thou art there.\" In this Astral projection, however, a certain part of the consciousness must remain in the body to protect the thought ray beyond the Sphere of sensation (as well as the sphere itself at that point of departure from the thought ray) from attack by any hostile force, so that the conscious- ness in this projection is not quite so strong as the con- sciousness when concentrated in the Natural Body in ordinary Life.

Also there is another mode of Astral projection which can be used by the more advanced Adept. This consisteth in forming a sphere from his own Sphere of Sensation, casting his reflection therein, and then pro- jecting this whole sphere to the desired place, as in the previous method. But this is nor easy to be done by any but the practiced Adept. This method of Astral projection was practiced only after the postu- lant had reached the Inner Order of the Golden Dawn and was experi- enced enough both to use and understand the various symbols, and to use it as a system of checks and balances against negative influences during the Astral trip. The Merkabah relates to both ascent and descent, which can be explained Kabbalistically as traveling up and down the Tree of Life. SEPHER YETZlRAH OR BOOK OF FORMATION The next Kabbalistic book of major proportion was the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation. The exact date of its origin is usually thought to be somewhere between the 3rd and 2nd century A.D. One legend asserts that the Prophet Abraham was the instigator of the theory of the book, which he received in a vision. Some Kabbalistic authorities have ascribed authorship of this volume to Rabbi Abba ben Joseph, who was also said to have authored a text on the mysteries of the \"Holy Alpha- bet.\" It is also interesting at this point to note that the Sepher Yetzirah was mentioned in the two Talmuds and may have formed a type of bridge between standard Rabbinical views and that of the Kabbalists. Phineas Mordell, in his 1914 edition of the Sepher Yetzirah, considers that it was written in two parts; the first being the original and the second being added around the 6th century. He disputes the claim of authorship to Rabbi Abba and relates the true author as being Joseph ben Uziel, giv- ing some very convincing arguments in favor of the latter. Adolphe"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Early Books 43 Franck, in his The Kabbalah,34 divides the essence of the Sepher Yetzirah into the following: 0) In general, the composition of the world; (2) In the division of the year or in the distribution of time in which the year is the principal unit; (3) The structure of man, the main principal unit- ing all these factors being the application of the book to the Macrocosm as well as to the Microcosm. It would be fair to say that up until the 9th century the main theme of Jewish doctrine was very much against Kabbalistic teaching, and in many instances was aimed at trying to prevent it from being taught. Gaon Saadiah (892-942 C.E.), head of the Persian Academy at Sura, and one of those who did an enormous amount of Hebrew Linguistic research into Kabbalistic teachings, was one of the first to give Kabbalism its full due as a metaphysical doctrine in its own right. He wrote a reputable commen- tary on the Sepher Yetzirah which still exists today and which brought a new understanding of Kabbalism to the Jewry of his own era. Gaon Hai (939-1038), a contemporary of Gaon Saadiah, also wrote a commentary on the Sepher Yetzirah, as well as other works that have strong Kabbalistic references, such as \"The Voice of God in its Power.\" The Sepher Yetzirah is a very different book in style from the Bahir and has none of the question and answer phrasing which is so character- istic of the Zoharic documents. Possibly one of the first published versions of the Sepher Yetzirah was in 1562, Mantua Edition. 35 The actual title of the Sepher Yetzirah is a little ambiguous for instead of a being a study of the Sephiroth it in fact is concerned with the forma- tion and structure of the Paths of the Kabbalah. The book itself is broken down into six chapters: Chapter 1 gives the breakdown of the ten Sephiroth and the 22 paths. It also discusses the theory of the Lightning Flash and the hidden method of ascending \"Jacobs Ladder\" through meditation. The formation of the elements is then discussed; from Spirit came Air, and from Air came Water, and from Water came Fire.

(5) IHV - Height (6) IVH - Dept (7) HIV - East (8) HVI - West (9) VIH - South (10) VHI - North 3S An observant student of either the Golden Dawn or the Kabbalah will notice that of all the Kabbalistic texts it is that of the Sepher Yetzirah which directly influenced parts of the rituals, diagrams, and teaching of the Golden Dawn. This is particularly true of all the concepts involving geographical direction, when combined with permutations of the Divine name YHVH. For example, at one point during the ritual of the 4=7 Grade of Philosophus, the Candidate is shown a diagram (see following page) and is told by the Hegemon: The Sepher Yetzirah divides the ten numbers into a Tetrad, answering to the Spirit of the Living Elohim: Air, Water, and Fire; and a Hexad, consisting of Height, Depth, East, West, South, and North, the six sides of the cube sealed with the six permutations of the letters YOD HEH and VAU of the Sacred Name.

The text then goes on to say that the three Mothers are sealed with six rings-relating to the lower portion of the diagram. The text then says:40 The Three Mothers in the world are Aleph, Mem, and Shin: the heavens were produced from Fire 41 ; the Earth from Water; and Air from the Spirit is as a reconciler between the Fire and the Water. The translation by Papus is a little fuller: 42 Three Principles are Shin, Aleph, Mem; fire, air and water. The origin of the sky is fire, the origin of the earth is water. Fire rises, water descends, and air is the regulato- ry medium between them. Aleph-Mem-Shin is sealed with six seals and enveloped in the male and female. Know, think and imagine that fire supports water. The Three Mothers are then associated with the year and the sea- sons, with Aleph (air, chest, lungs) representing the temperate climate, Mem (water, belly) for the winter, and Shin (fire, head) for summer. The same idea can be found almost identically expressed in the Mishna 3, Chapter 3, where it says: God created in the World-Fire, Water, and Air. In Man, the Head, Body, and Breast. In the Year, heat, cold and wet. 19 Westcott states in hIS translation of the Sepher YetZlrah that this permutation adds up to 242 and cites the Postellus Edition as giving the reason why 11 are omitted to get a total of 231.

Also associated with these letters are the seven directions of space, the seven days of the week, seven heavens and earths, the seven Sabbaths, and the seven planets. 43 Chapter 5 equates the 12 simple letters with the 12 zodiac signs, 12 properties, 12 directions, and the 12 months of the year. 44 Overall this difficult chapter, chapter 6, shows the relationship of the elemental divisions of the zodiac in both partnership and opposites.P To simplify the associations of the Hebrew letters by way of analogy the astrological association is by far the easiest and most documented. THE ZOHAR OR BOOK OF SPLENDOR The formation of the Zahar in manuscript form is said to have come from Simon ben ]ochai, who lived in or around 150 to 170 C.E. Condemned to death by the Roman Lucius Aurelius Yerus (co-regent with Emperor Mar- cus Aurelius Verus), Rabbi Simon ben ]ochai escaped to some secluded caves where, during his enforced 12-year captivity, he is said to have writ- ten down the oral tradition of the Kabbalah that he had received. It was here also that he communicated with the Prophet Elias, who further revealed to him the Kabbalistic mysteries. On his death (accompanied by many strange manifestations of light and sounds) his son (Rabbi Ellezer) and assistant (Rabbi Abba) were said to have gathered his teachings together, which formed the frame of the Zahar. 43 The Zelator rituals of the Golden Dawn covers this in part in explaining the diagram of the seven- branched candlestick. 44 This chapter relates to the 1 ~ 10 grade of Zelaror when explaining the diagram of the Table of Shrcwbread. This diagram, like rhar of the table of Shrewbread, were of great esotenc significance to the Golden Dawn. Although first introduced in the First Order, they were later studied in great depth in the Second Order. 45 This entire chapter formed the basis for the complex Golden Dawn paper. \"Convoluted Forces.\" For a simplified viewpoint of it see the forthcoming The Magical Taro,of the Golden Dawn, by Pat and Chris Zalewski."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Early Books The Seven-Branched Candlestick 49 The ZOMr first appeared in Spain in 1290 when Moses de Leon passed out various manuscripts (written in Aramaic) which were pur- ported to be the 20har as received by Simon ben Jochai. 46 When the 20har was first received by Jewry, one Isaac of Acco came to visit de Leon and found that he had died.

His first criticism of de Leon, which outlines the events he encountered with his widow, is given in the Divrey Ya Hamin.

The worlds are said to represent the Four Letters of the Divine Name. Generally, they can be applied to four separate versions of the Tree of Life, or also divide the one Tree into four separate divisions. The First World is that of Atziluth and is linked to the Yod Force of the Divine Name and, by the Golden Dawn, to the Tarot Suit of Wands. This is often called the Archetypal or World of the Spirit for here we have the very first impetus of an abstract idea that works on the broad outline of a concept of a plan. The Second World is that of Briah and relates to the Heh force and to the Suit of Cups of the Tarot. This is the Creative World and shows that the idea or concept as formulated in Atziluth has now taken root in some sort of large framework and is being developed into some sort of workable structure. The Third World is that of Yetzirah and is the Vau force as well as being linked to the Sword Suit of the Tarot.

Now that the whole mental process of the idea has been assimilated this World now works on the physical plane of action, the end result of the lofty concepts as formulated in Arziluth. THE VEILS OF NEGATIVE EXISTENCE Before any understanding is possible of how the Sephiroth function, the primary structure of the way in which the Divine Energy enters the Sephi- roth through the three Veils of Negative Existence must be understood. The following lecture on this subject is taken from MacGregor Mathers' introduction to the Kabbalah Unveiled, and was considered an unofficial side lecture on the subject to be studied by Golden Dawn Adepti: 34. The idea of negative existence can then exist asan idea, but it will not bear definition, since the idea of definition is utterly incompatible with its nature. \"But,\" some of my readers will perhaps say, \"your term negative existence is surely a mis- nomer; the state you describe would be better expressed by the title of negative subsistence.\" Not so, I answer; for negative subsistence can never be anything but negative subsistence; it cannot vary, it cannot develop; for negative subsistence is lit- erally and truly no thing. Therefore, negative subsistence can- not be at all; it never has existed, it never does exist, it never will exist. But negative existence bears hidden in itself, posi- tive life; for in the limitless depths of the abyss of its negativi- ty lies hidden the power of standing forth from itself, the power of projecting the scintilla of the thought unto the utter, the power of re-involving the syntagma into the inner. Thus shrouded and veiled is the absorbed intensity in the centreless whirl of the vastness of expansion. Therefore have I employed the term \"Ex-sto,\" rather than \"Sub-sec.\" 35. But between two ideas so different as those of negative and positive existence a certain nexus, or connecting-link, is required, and hence we arrive at the form which is called potential existence, which while more nearly approaching"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"56 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn positive existence, will still scarcely admit of clear definition. It is existence in its possible form. For example, in a seed, the tree which may spring from it is hidden; it is in a condition of potential existence; is there; but it will not admit of defin- ition. How much less, then, will those seeds which that tree in its turn may yield. But these latter are in a condition which, while it is somewhat analogous to potential existence, is in hardly so advanced a stage; that is, they are negatively existent. 36. But, on the other hand, positive existence is always capable of definition; it is dynamic; it has certain evident powers, and it is therefore the antithesis of negative existence, and still more so of negative subsistence. It is the tree, no longer hidden in the seed, but developed into the outer. But positive existence has a beginning and an end, and it therefore requires another form from which to depend, for without this other concealed negative ideal behind it, it is unstable and unsatisfactory. 37. Thus, then, have I faintly and with all reverence endeavoured to shadow forth to the minds of my readers the idea of the Illimitable One. And before that idea, and of that idea, I can only say, in the words of an ancient oracle: \"In Him is an illim- itable abyss of glory, and from it there goeth forth one little spark which maketh all the glory of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars. Mortal! behold how little I know of God; seek not to know more of Him, for this is far beyond thy compre- hension, however wise thou art; as for us, who are His minis- ters, how small a part are we of Him!\" 38. There are three qabalistical veils of the negative existence, and in themselves they formulate the hidden ideas of the Sephiroth not yet called into being, and they are concentrat- ed in Kether, which in this sense is the Malkuth of the hidden ideas of the Sephiroth, I will explain this. The first veil of neg- ative existence is the AIN, Ain = Negativity. This word con- sists of three letters, which thus shadow forth the first three Sephiroth or numbers. The second veil is the AIN SVP, Ain Soph = the Limitless. This title consists of six letters, and shad- ows forth the idea of the first six Sephiroth or numbers. The third veil is the AIN SVP Avr, Ain Soph AUT = the Limitless Light. This again consists of nine letters and symbolizes the first nine Sephiroth, but of course in their hidden idea only.

Because the Sephiroth were ten in number, Mathers made the observation that abstract concepts of mathematics could also be applied to the Sephiroth. Within the Sephi- roth themselves there are large polarity swings of both genders, but which are still abstract in concept. They develop in varying stages so that when each stage reaches its maximum point a new level is created for the refined energy to go to the next level. The Sephiroth can be observed to be anal- ogous to glass receptacles of varying shapes and quantities. When one is full, then the energy overflows to the next, where it conforms to the shape of the vessel and what that shape represents. The first three Sephiroth are very important, for many have consid- ered this Supernal triad to be manifested, yet still in a state that is invisi- ble to us. In a modem light it could be likened to a DNA chain or to the formation of basic atoms or molecules that have formed a certain pattern, yet have not yet multiplied enough for visible states of growth.t'' It should be observed that the Sephiroth are also opened up to the manipulation of negative influences as well as of good ones. The Ten ineffable Sephiroth have ten vast regions bound unto them; boundless in origin and having no ending; an abyss of good and of ill; measureless height and depth ... 50 From this we see divided in each Sephirah a positive and negative polarity that can be related to both Spiritual and demonic hierarchies. Since each Sephirah has both positive and negative polarities incorpo- rated in it, then one may assume that there are certain Sephiroth that are grouped under both headings. Once polarity has been established, the neutral polarity must be accepted as well, and certain Sephiroth now fall under this heading, but all in balanced juxtaposition one to each other. 49 See Superstrings: a TheCfry of Everything?

Later Kabbalists have considered the Sephiroth as being placed on three pillars (Severity, Middle, and Mercy) while others have used the age-old glyph of the Tree of Life (which has been with us since antiquity) to apply the Sephiroth visually in balanced disposition. The First of the Sephiroth is called Kerher, the Crown, which is the first manifested form and which many have associated with the Hebrew name of God as shown in the letters YHVH,5I the incomprehensible deity. Kether is often referred to the Godhead as the primal source of manifestation. The Hebrew name associated with this is AHIH,52 mean- ing \"I am,\" a simple statement of manifestation. There are a number of ways to visualize Kether. The first is to view it by way of descent. Here we have a homogeneous force that is perfect in every way except for experience, and that is what it must gain before it can' be reunited with itself in Malkuth, the last Scphirah. In many respects, Kether is much like the spirit of man as he arrives on this plane of existence; he must gain experience through the process of trial and tribulation before the re-unification with the Higher Self at death. Any Sephirah, Kether included, can be applied to the smallest speck or atom of this planet and also to the greatest distance in the heavens. This explains the reference in the Sepher Yetzirah to the Sephiroth being boundless and having no ending. Looking at Kether by way of ascent here, we have the Godhead on earth, perfection as far as the physical laws will allow. It is something everyone aspires to, for Kether is the absolute ideal, untainted by the fears and worries of this world, for it has risen above them. The Mathers description of the Sephiroth, as given in the Book of the Path of the Chameleon, 53 is as given below: First are the Feminine colours of the Sephiroth, the Queen's Scale. In Kether is the Divine White Brilliance, the scintillation and corruscation of the Divine Glory- that Light which lighterh the Universe-that Light 51 Exodus 20,2, \"I am YHVH thy God.\" 52 Exodus 3014 \"I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God.

And the Sphere of its Operation is called Rashith ha-Gil- galium-the beginning of whirling, the Primum Mobile or First Mover, which bestoweth the gift of life in all things and filleth the whole Universe. And Eheieh is the Name of the Divine Essence in Kether; and its Arch- angel is the Prince of Countenances-Metatron or Metraton, He who bringeth others before the face of God. And the Name of its Order of Angels is called Chaioth ha-Qadesh, the Holy Living Creatures, which are also called the Order of Seraphim. 61 The Second Sephirah is called Chokmah, Wisdom. It shows the establishment of polarity in a balanced and harmonious disposition. The Divine name associated to Chokmah is YH, a derivative of YHYH. In this situation Chokmah is the first break from Kether (by way of descent). The complete unit must now start to separate its component parts from the whole so that each can experience a new dimension of what it is designed for. Although separated, Chokmah still acknowledges that Kether is its superior and that any knowledge coming to it will be through the perfected point. In many ways Chokmah is still under the reflected glory of Kether, for the Wisdom that it utilizes is still far above that of normality, and in many aspects this in itself is something to aspire to. Since Chokmah is the first separation from Kether, it is the masculine essence or seed and as such srill pliable. It is a mixture of both the Wisdom of God and the Wisdom man tries to attain. It is the Sephirah that gives man the chance of attaining what is normally the unattainable through the power of the intellect. The Zohar 54 (Temurah, Folio 155a) says: YHYH created man in the mystery of Wisdom (Chokmah) and made him with great art and breathed into him the Soul of Life, so thar he might know and understand the mysteries of Wisdom to attain His glory. Wisdom can be ascribed to many different levels and, to make mat- ters extremely complex, it is said rhat in each Sephirah there are in fact ,I From Whare Ra temple papers. by unknown translator."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"62 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn ten Sephiroth. The first manifestation of wisdom is, of course, Kether of Chokmah, while rhe other end of the scale is Malkuth of Chokmah. In terms of the Microcosmos, the areas in between each of rhese extremes vary according to the type of person one is, which Eastern mystics have considered to be states of satori. The complexity of this is that, while man or woman may be satisfied with one level of Wisdom, it is not unheard of for him or her, during a lifetime, to rap into the orher levels as well. On what level and for how long he or she is able to do this, of course, depends on the individual and on what is happening in his or her life during that moment. For some gifted or advanced individuals, this can be done simul- taneouslv with more than one level at a time. In Chokmah is a cloud-like grey which containeth vari- ous colours and is mixed with them, like a transparent pearl-hued mist, yet radiating withal, as if behind it there was a brilliant glory. And the Sphere of its influence is in Masloth, the Starry Heaven, wherein it disposeth the forms of things. And Yah is the Divine Ideal Wisdom, and its archangel is Ratziel, the Prince or Princes of the knowledge of hidden and concealed things, and the name of its Order of Angels is Auphanim, the wheels or the whirling Forces which are also called the Order of Kerubim. 55 The Third Sephirah is Binah, Understanding, and it shows the establishment of the Triad and the next step after Wisdom. while Wis- dom gives us the ability to discern things, Understanding shows us the way to do it. The Divine Name associated to Binah is YHVH ELOHIM which means \"Lord my God.\" The name Binah, in fact, comes from the Hebrew BNYH, Ben, a Son, and YH from Chokmah, showing the Son ofChokmah. In many respects Binah is the other side of the coin to that which Chokmah represents. The Divine Name Elohim shows that the name Binah is something of a misrepresentation, for the Hebrew hnguistic components of Elohim show the combination of both masculine and fem- inine. While the name in itself is masculine, the Holy name is a mixture of both, showing a very feminine trait underlying this Sephirah. For the 55 From \"Hodos Charnelionis.\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Structure of the Tree 63 purpose of this discussion we will concentrate on its masculine impetus, as the feminine side of its nature will be discussed in a later section. The key word of this Sephirah being \"Understanding\" shows that it is an energy or form that channels information and compartmentalizes it. Binah brings out the whole pattern of things, to see things in a totality at the top end of the scale, such as Kether of Binah. For those at the lower end of the scale we have an overconcern for trivia, the dissecting of the part taken to the extreme so that the whole is forgotten. In Zoharistic Kabbalism there is no direct connection of Binah and Kether, as one has to get to Chokmah to get to Kether: but in later schools of Kabbalistic thought, when the Paths were considered in the form of the Tree of Life, Binah actually linked directly to Kether through the Path of Beth. This later appendage of Kabbalism is further complicat- ed due to the fact some schools do not agree on which Path connects with which Sephirah. Beth is considered by some to be the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet due to the fact that Bahir says:56 And what does Beth resemble? It is like Man, formed by YHVH with Wisdom (Chokmah) he is closed on all sides but opened in front. This shows that there is still a strong connection directly between Binah and Kether through the Path of Beth. Understanding is a very nec- essary concept to provide the frame for Chokman- Wisdom, for without Understanding, Wisdom cannot be attained or conceptualized. In Binah is a thick darkness which yet veileth the Divine Glory in which all colours are hidden, wherein is mystery and depth and silence, and yet, it is the habitation of Supernal Light. There is the Supernal Triad completed. And the Sphere of its Operation is Shabbathai, or rest, and it giveth forms and similtudes unto chaotic matter and it ruleth the sphere of action of the planet Saturn. And Jehovah E10him is the perfection of Creation and the Life of the World to Come.

This shows Mercy being expressed from Wisdom and Understanding. The Divine Name associated with this Sephirah is AL, which means God. AL is the Holy Spirit that can loosen its grip on the material for those traveling up the Sephiroth of the Kabbalah, thus help- ing them to cross up to Binah. For while we are investigating here the ori- gins and formation of the Kabbalah, the practical use of the Kabbalah must be always kept in mind. It can be used like a ladder for those magi- cians and aspirants ascending it in their endeavor to unite with the God- head in Kether. In many respects Chesed is a very important Sephirah, for it is the first of the manifested Sephiroth beyond the triad of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah. It is also the first one from which to cross the Abyss (Daath) to get to Binah, by way of ascent. There is no Path connecting Binah and Chesed, and how one travels a route that is not laid out is something of a mystery. It is the area of the shadow Sephirah Daath which cannot be considered a Sephirah proper. A full explanation will be given in the sec- tion on the Tree of Life, before and after the Fall of Man. The Golden Dawn taught that before the so-called Fall there was another Tree in which Daath was a Sephirah proper, connected by two paths. The Gold- en Dawn teaching was that to get up to Binah by way of ascent one must follow the emanation of the old Paths. Another title for Chesed is \"Grace\" and this helps us to understand the term Mercy more correctly. Chesed relates to the accumulation of good deeds or efforts in which stare forgiveness is given. It is considered one of the finest virtues one can attain. This is achieved through flawless love, of a fraternal nature, for the Understanding of Binah is now con- verted into a state of further receptiveness. By way of ascent on the Tree, Chesed takes the power and activity of the subsequent and severe Sephi- rah of Geburah and has simply consumed or swamped the severe power until it is enveloped with a concept of self love. By analogy it is very much like the cushion absorbing the sharp blow of the rapier until it has extended irself and encloses it with its receptivity. In Chokmah is the Radix of blue and thence is there a blue colour pure and primitive, and glistening with a spiritual Light which is reflected unto Chesed.

The Sephira Chesed is also called Gedulah or Magnificence and Glory.58 65 The Fifth Sephirah is Geburah, Severity. This is, of course, the polar opposite of Mercy, showing that an extremity has been reached through harsh action. The Divine Name for this Sephirah is ELOHIM GIBOR, meaning \"God's wars or battles.\" This is not an easy Sephirah as it deals with Victory only after trial and tribulations, thereby showing that nothing in its area of influence will come easy. Geburah is the Sephirah of rule and retribution, of trial and tribulation, and it repre- sents the extreme of these. By way of descent, Geburah has taken the receptivity of Chesed to the extreme, where it cannot give any more and now enforces a strict dis- cipline upon it to circumvent any future actions of this nature. The Divine Name also shows the feminine aspect associated with this Sephi- rah. This is not the gentle feminine quality but the harsh vengeful quali- ty that is, in many respects, more fierce then any masculine quality and is totally unrelenting. The feminine concept is very much needed in Gebu- rah to receive the Emanations of Chesed and then transform them by way of its masculine counterpart, so that the feminine energy is transmuted to suit the temperament of the Sephirah. These aspects are well illustrated by the following from the Song of Songs (6: 10). Who is She that looks forth as the dawn, fair as the Moon, clear as the sun, terrible like an army with banners. By way of ascent, Geburah develops from the Beauty of Tiphareth and becomes proud. The pride, in tum, can become eventually arrogance. The fine line is drawn in this Sephirah between arrogance and discipline. \\H Ibid."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn The harshness of this Sephirah spares no one, for here we can meet the hard-core religious fanatic and zealot who would enforce his spiritual beliefs by the point of the sword. We can also meet the mercenary soldier. Both are wading deep in the blood of their fellow man, yet each with his own preconceptions of why he is acting like he is. In the Zohar we are told of how both David and Jacob were to face the Lord over their transgres- sions, not so much for punishment but due to separation from YHVH. Jacob felt he had no need for Geburah and longed for the Mercy of Chesed because it was closer to YHVH. Geburah, though, is a very nec- essary Sephirah, for (by way of ascension) one has to have the extreme of Mercy to temper the Severity of one's nature. In Binah is the Radix of Red, and therein is the red colour, pure and scintillating and flashing with flame which is reflected unto Geburah. The Sphere of its Operation is called Madim or violent rushing Force and it bringeth fortitude, and war and strength and slaugh- ter, as it were the flaming Sword of an avenging God. And it ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Planet Mars. And E!ohim Gibor is the Elohim, Mighty and Terrible, judging and avenging evil, ruling in wrath and terror and storm, and at whose steps are lightning and flame. Its Archangel is Kamael, the Prince of Strength and Courage, and the Name of the Order of the Angels is Seraphim-the Flaming Ones who are also called the Order of Powers. The S~hirah Geburah is also called Pachad- Terror and Fear. The Sixth Sephirah is Tiphareth, Beauty. This Sephirah stands directly below Kether on the Middle Pillar and the emanations that flow from it are then mixed with those of Geburah and Chesed so that a perfectly balanced, radiant polarity for the whole Tree of Life is found. Its title is directly related to the emanations of Kether that bind it to harmonizing those of Geburah and Chesed thereby achieving that per- fection which the Kabbalists often call \"perfection.\" The Divine Name of this Sephirah is YHVH ELOAH VE DAATH which roughly trans- lated means \"God's knowledge,\" showing the direct link with the God- head in Kether, 59 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Structure of the Tree 67 Beauty is a word that well describes Tiphareth because, by virtue of its placement directly under Kether through the Path of Gimel, it reflects the glory of the Godhead in Kether. By ways of descent, Tiphareth breaks away from the martial Geburah and stops halfway on its trip to the other side of the Tree in the Pillar of Mercy to its station in Netzach- Victory. Severity, when taken to yet another extreme and stopped in the Middle Pillar as Tiphareth, creates a whole new approach, for the aggres- siveness is tempered by Kether' s Glory, creating the Beauty of what one is seeking. For some it can be said in the American expression \"the brass ring,\" meaning the whole of one's wants and desires in one package, an ideology delivered. It is a time of rebirth and for a change of values. Kether is the Radix of a Golden Glory and thence is there a pure, primitive and sparkling, gleaming golden yellow which is reflected unto Tiphareth. Thus is the first reflected triad completed. And the Sphere of its operation is that of Shemesh, the Solar Light, and bestoweth Life, Light and Brilliancy in metallic matter, and it ruleth the sphere of action of the Sun.

The Divine Name for this Sephirah is YHVH TzBAOTH, which means \"Lord of Hosts,\"and relates to one of the Seven Archons who created the Universe. Netzach takes the Beauty of Tiphareth and distributes it towards a desired end. The operative word for this Sephirah is \"desire,\" something that relates strongly to Netzach. The brightness of Kether that is reflect- ed through Tiphareth is now channeled into a format that can control it, for while Beauty remains on the Middle Pillar it becomes a center of sorts,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"68 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn with little control or direction to it, yet when it is transformed into Net- zach, the tremendous amount of energy it has is now focused, and that is where Victory comes in. This focus point can barely contain the beauty and power of Tiphareth yet it does so by fine tuning it to the point that no one or no thing can stand up to its burst. The energy of the Creator, through its link from Kether directly above it, knows no defeat and its energies overcome all obstacles. Since beauty and radiance have their limitations that energy must be harnessed into something progressive, and this is where Netzach is formed. Geburah at the other end of the scale shows power, but this is not directed, where- as Netzach performs this function with the help of the divine interven- tion of Kether. The beams of Chesed and of Tiphareth meet in N etracr: and thence arises a green, pure brilliant liquid, and gleaming like an emerald.

This Sephirah like its oppo- site number, Netzach, is the last in the Pillar of Severity, showing that the energies of this dynamic Pillar are now at their strongest. The Divine Name for Hod is ELOHIM TzABOATH meaning \"God's Hosts\" (or armies) and relates to the martial aspect of God's works as the end result. The term \"Elohim,\" with its hidden feminine concept, is applied here as well, and this shows that the Victory of Netzach has reached the point where the competition or pushing now stops. The divine energy of that Victory is converted into the pomp and glory that creates Splendor. In many ways Splendor is the victory celebration after the battle 61 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Structure of the Tree 69 celebration is over. Since Splendor is on the Pillar of Severity, the pomp and circumstance of Hod now takes the celebration to the extremity and it becomes an issue all in itself. The Bhagavad-Gita says: The Splendour of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this universe, is due to me. And the Splendour of the moon and the splendour of fire are also from me. This verse shows how all the opposites that eclipse the universe emanate from the same source no matter how things may swing one way or the other. Eventually the Universal balance is attained. The beams of Geburah and Tiphareth meet in Hod and thence arises in Hod a brilliant and pure flashing orange tawny. And the Sphere of its Operation is that of Kokab, the Stellar light, bestowing elegance, swiftness, and sci- entific knowledge and art, and constancy of speech, and it ruleth the sphere of the action of the planet Mercury.

And its Archangel is Michael, the Prince of Splendour and of Wisdom, and the Name of the Order of Angels is Beni Elohim, or Sons of the Gods, who are also called the Order of Archangels. 62 The Ninth Sephirah is Yesod, Foundation. This is the Sephirah on the middle path that now tapers the two completed forces of Splendor and Victory into Foundation. Yesod is a basic building block on which further developments can be built. In many respects this Sephirah is much like the foetus in the Womb, fully formed but not yet grown to full maturity. The Divine Name of this Sephitah is SHADDAI EL CHAI which means \"Mighty Living One\" and is concerned with the creation of Life on a new level. The Splendor of Hod is now transformed into the building blocks or foundation of a new beginning, just as the Victory of Netzach has vanquished the opposition. A new era now begins and the old is no more. Kether, through the influence of Tiphareth, has pushed its rays down the central pillar to Yesod so that they stabilize the celebration of ,i2 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"70 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn Hod into something more than a momentary high, but something con- crete and lasting.

And the sphere of its operation is that of Levanah, the Lunar beam, bestowing change, increase and decrease upon cre- ated things and it ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Moon and the nature of mankind.

Malkuth is the final Sephirah where an emergence of a vast and complete cosmic cycle has been completed. Apart from the emanations of Yesod placed above, it is now time for the emanations from Hod and Netzach to blend in togeth- er and to give additional impetus to the form. The Divine Name applied here is ADONAI HA ARETZ, meaning \"Lord of Earth.\" This concerns the stabilization of matter through the influence of the Spirit in Kether which Malkuth is a reflection of, in a much deeper form.

Thus from the orange tawny of Hod and the green nature of Netzach, there goeth forth a certain greenish \"citrine\" colour, yet pure and translucent withal.

And from this green of Netzah and the puce of Yesod there goeth forth a cer- tain other darkening green \"olive\" yet rich and glowing withal.

The actual origin of the original work that both texts were based on is obscure, though it formed a very important part of the Golden Dawn teachings. It was mainly used in the Tarot descriptions'f of the 22 Trumps and utilized in the rituals of the Golden Dawn proper, the Alpha et Omega and the Stella Matutina, to help describe the Paths of the Tree of Life. In many respects this little document is the mainstay of Kabbalistic teaching within the Order and also outside of it. The first ten \"Paths\" as they are called relate to the Sephirorh themselves and the next 22 relate to the Paths proper of the Kabbalah. 67 The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom issue forth from Chokmah, the Father of Wisdom, the Yod force of our nature for this showeth the spirit of the Theoretical Kab- balah, before the Dew of Wisdom hath implanted its seed into Adam. 68 64 Ibid. 65 Kircher said \"The 32 Parhs of Wisdom are rhe luminous roads by which holy men of God. rhrough long usage, long experience of divine things and long meditation upon them, can attain the hid- den centers.\" 66 See forthcoming The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn by Pat and Chris Zalewski for an explana- tion of how this is applied. 67 A very thorough analysis is given in the Golden Dawn Correspondence Course. 68 This quote IS from a notation by Mathers which was the lead paragraph to my copy of this docu- ment.

The Second Path is that of the Illuminating Intelligence: it is the Crown of Creation, the Splendour of the Unity, equalling it, and it is exalted above every head, and named by the Kabalists the Second Glory. The Third Path is the Sanctifying Intelligence, and is the basis of foundation of Primordial Wisdom, which is called the Former of Faith, and its roots are Amn; and it is the parent of Faith, from whose virtues doth Faith emanate. The Fourth Path is named Measuring, Cohesive or Recep- tacular: and is so called because it contains aU holy powers, and from it emanate all the spiritual virtues with the most exalted essences: they emanate one from the other by the power of the Primordial emanation. (The Highest Crown.) The Fifth Path is called the Radical Intelligence, because it is itself the essence equal to the Unity, uniting itself to the Binah, or Intelligence which emanates from the Primordial depths of Wisdom or Chokmah. The Sixth Path is called the Intelligence of the Mediating Influence, because in it are multiplied the influxes of the ema- nations, for it causes that influence to flow into all the reser- voirs of the Blessings, with which these themselves are united. The Seventh Path is the Occult Intelligence, because it is the Refulgent Splendour of all the Intellectual virtues which are perceived by the eyes of intellect, and by the contempla- tion of faith. The Eighth Path is called Absolute or Perfect, because it is the means of the primordial, which has no root by which it can cleave, nor rest, except in the hidden places of Gedulah, Magnificence, which emanate from its own proper essence. The Ninth Path is the Pure Intelligence, so called because it purifies the Numerations, it proves and corrects the design- ing of their representation, and disposes their unity with which they are combined without diminution or division. The Tenth Path is the Resplendent Intelligence, because it is exalted above every other head, and sits on the throne of Binah (the Intelligence of the Third Path).

Without any understanding of both the theory of these scales and how they are used in practical magic, one cannot expect to make much progress as a magician in the Golden Dawn system. The sym- bolic importance of the color lies behind virtually every aspect of the work undertaken in both the First and Second Orders. When Mathers created this color system he rook it from 22 systems of color theory with no two colors being exactly identical, sometimes the separation between colors being only a slight shade lighter or darker. This subject was indeed one of the most complex among the Order's teachings and due to the difficulty of painting the colors correctly many adopted their own set of scales. Whar I have presented here is what was original- ly in the Golden Dawn and the following set of color scales was taken from a very early manuscript, later altered a number of times by various temples over the years. This manuscript also had a ser of very well-pre- served, painted scales, and although I have had the advantage of adding the odd piece of modern color terminology when I felt it needed it, I have resisted tampering with it. There are some interesting differences when rhese scales are com- pared with those of Crowley's 777. I note that in these, Binah in the Queen Scale is given the correct coloring of Blackish Red, whereas Crow- ley gives it as Black, altogether ignoring its Red Root. Since the Crowley Scales are readily available, I have decided to give this version which I obtained from the papers of a former Chief of Whare Ra Temple. Having said that I would add that either the Crowley Scales or the ones given here can be used and the choice is ultimately up to the reader as I am unsure which is the earlier version. The truth of the matter is that there are so many versions of the Color Scales (even Mathers altered his own on a number of occasions) that to give a completely authoritative version is almost impossible.P\" The scales are numbered from 1 to 32. The first 69 Oral tradition at Whate Ra temple has it that the original scales were partly unusable when they were applied to the coloring of the Tarot Trumps. An example of this is the 18th scale for each of the Four Trees which relates to the Tarot Trump the \"Chariot.\" as given in the Crowley scales. A comparison with these scales will show the difference, though this is only one example of some of the changes. It would be a fair comment to S<lY that the color scales were altered from the originals ro fir in with the T arot cards."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"76 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn ten numbers relate to the Sephirorh, while the rest are concerned with the Paths. The association of the 22 Trumps to the scales actually starts at Number 11, which is the first Path after the ten Sephiroth. In the Golden Dawn there were two theories of color mixing. The first was to have bright colors that gradually darken with the mixing, so that some colors achieve a type of color that is not easy to identify. The second approach is to make the colors translucent or very watery, and when one reaches the colors of the Prince and Princess Scale, for instance, the original root color can be identified. When myoid mentor from Whare Ra Temple taught me the scales he made me use both meth- ods when painting the Four Trees; by doing the former, then watering it down somewhat around the dark colors so that these appeared like a glow or hue on both the Sephiroth and Paths.

Now we come to another dimension of the Kabbalah where instead of Ten Sephiroth we have a series of figures or Partsufim (Countenances). Like the Sephirorh, the Partsufim are included in the Zohar proper, main- ly in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery,\" \"Greater Assembly,\" and \"Lesser Assembly\" which Mathers translated from the Latin of Kabbala Denuda- ta, and published under the title Kabbalah Unveiled. For many within the Golden Dawn, this Mathers' work was a source of study in the Partsufim theory, yet it is barely mentioned in the Order's Knowledge lectures.I! Apart from the official Knowledge lectures of the Order, there were a number of papers handed around on the subject that seemed to come from two sources. The first is from an early English translation of the Zohar from Levi's Bookof Splendours (dated 1897), and the second from a series of papers that have come from Rosenroth's Kabbala Denudata, which included three explanations of diagrams and quotes from the text (which Mathers translated). These were placed together in a section of scattered notes called the \"Book of the Long Face.\" The introduction to 71 It comprises mainly the Fifth Knowledge Lecture. 79"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"80 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn this section is missing, though Taylor remembers it being taught in the early 1930s at Whare Ra. Attached to this were also translations of por- tions of Franck's work on the Kabbalah and that of Ginsburg and jellinek. These were done in the Golden Dawn proper, and not the Stella Matuti- na, according to Taylor. I have taken the liberty of expanding the skele- tonic framework of these notes, that were given out in lecture form, and combining it with other Golden Dawn lectures to form the basis of this section of the book. To call these papers unofficial may be misleading, as there were a number of very valuable documents that Mathers translated and that were circulated among Golden Dawn Adepti which could be termed unofficial, yet still were studied widely. Regardie, I feel, was the one who perpetrated this mistaken type of thinking about Golden Dawn papers. What one Temple deemed official another Temple did not, hence the apparent confusion over the status of certain documents. I have in my possession a number of notes made by Mathers on the Tarot that were classed as official by Whare Ra tutors and students alike, yet were never shown nor published in collections of Golden Dawn material. These notes were not classed as Knowledge Lectures but \"side lectures,\" and are not to be confused with the Flying Rolls. In certain of the Golden Dawn papers there are some very subtle theories which can only have come from the Partsufim concept, though they have never been acknowledged openly as such. For example, within the Golden Dawn Tarot scheme, all the Court Cards are based on the Partsufim theory. A failure to understand the Parrsufim theory will pre- vent the gaining of understanding, not merely of the Court Cards and their formation, as used within the Order, but also of many Kabbalistic concepts. One of the things that has often amazed me about this Partsufim section is that it is largely ignored by students of the Kabbalah in favor of the Sephirotic system despite being of equal importance. In fact, it is an additional dimensional and crucial concept of Kabbalistic study. It is for this reason we are going to devote a great deal of space to it. In order to understand the concept of creation, before, during and after the Fall of Man, the heavens were mapped out in the form of a face or countenance of Man, which was said to reflect God's image. Each part of this face has a certain significance and is applied to Kab-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"An Extra Dimension of the Tree 81 balistic thought. The Ten Sephiroth are included as a type of extension of it, for the Zahar discusses the concealed Adam (or first Adam) who encompasses the Ten Sephirorh. The Partsufim scheme tried to incor- porate the Sephirotic development and actually take it a step further, and give a huge overview of the varying stages of development, and show how the varying Trees of Life are incorporated in its vast theory. The Golden Dawn tried to simplify this in a single diagram, showing the main divisions of the Partsufim theory by grouping various Sephi- roth together. To a certain extent the Partsufim theory continues where the Sephi- rothic emanations leave off. At this juncture in the Zahar we are faced with what could be described as a fifth world of the Kabbalist, made up of four divisions, AB, SAG, MAH, and BEN. These divisions are derived from a permutation of the letters YHVH, sometimes called in each of the Four Worlds. Within the Golden Dawn papers (in the 4=7 ritual and associated papers) however, Mathers opted for the four traditional worlds and thus applied these to the Partsufim theory. The next phase is the grouping of the ten Sephiroth through seven stages. From this point there is a further negative space, or Abyss. This is not to be confused with the Ain Soph Aur, but an area of what one would call Negative Space, which is then reformed into the Second primordial Adam, for the Zahar says: He spoke firstly of the Kings who ruled over Edom before the arrival of the King of Israel, symbols of the unbal- anced powers which manifested themselves at the begin- ning of the Universe, before the triumph of harmony. \"God\" said he, \"when he wished to create, threw over his radiance a veil, and in its folds, he cast a shadow. From this shadow there arose Giants who said: 'We are Kings' but they were nothing more than phantoms. They appeared because God had hidden himself by creating Night within Chaos; they disappeared when there was brought forth from the east that Luminious Head, that glowing head that humanity gives itself by proclaiming the existence of God, the sun, governor of our aspira- tions and our thoughts. \"Gods are mirages made of shadow, and God is the synthesis of splendours. Usurpers fall away when the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"82 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn King mounts his throne, and when God appears, the Gods are banished.\"72 What we have here, by analogy, is the fact that the previous chaos is not nothingness nor negativeness, but simply a state of imbalance that is corrected by the shining light of the sun sweeping away the darkness, and the formation of a new archetypal face. For we are told: The Divine Image is a double one. There are heads of light and shadow, the white ideal and the black ideal, the upper head and the lower. One is the dream of the Man- God and the other is the invention of the God-man. One represents God the wise, and the other, the idol of the lowly.73 The restoration of Adam by YHYH shows that in the single head, called the Attik Yomin or the Ancient of Days,74 are three further heads and these are but a reflection of the Supernal Triad. Each head comprises a Tree of Life of Ten Sephiroth which has been reflected through and down by the emanations of the First Adam. The first head is Concealed Wisdom, the second is Hidden Wisdom, while the third head is Remain- ing Wisdom. The diagram of the head is broken down into seven parts: (1) The cranium or skull has no beginning but the emanations reflected on its surface are said to have received the input from 400 worlds. This figure is arrived at through the fact that each of the ten Sephiroth contains ten Sephiroth( for example Malkuth of Kether, Yesod of Kether, etc.) and this situation is reflected in each of the Four Worlds of Arzilurh, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah-thus 10 x 10 x 4 = 400. It is also the numerical value of Tau, the last letter in the Hebrew Alphabet for, while it has no beginning, it has an end or limit to its size. The Zohar tells us that the skull is the residual place of knowledge and is the residence not only of the Son but of the 32 Paths and 50 gates. 75 72 Idra Suta. 7J Ibid. 74 He is called the Ancient of Days because Daniel said that he had seen the Thrones of Life giving Fire overturned and the Ancient of Days sit down so that he can renew the world around Him.

(4) The eyes have no eyelashes or eyebrows 77 for the figure never sleeps and represents the vigilance of Israel. The Eyes, Skull, and fore- head represent the Yod force, as a combined unit. The eyes have three emanations from them and this is from the Supernal triad reflected there- in. Their colors change from black to white, depending on the influence at the time. (5) The nose is the gateway for the spirit of life, the breath, to enter and exit. It represents the Heh force. Within the Zoharic text great importance is placed on the number of breaths, for example four quick breaths are said to come from YHVH. (6) The beard is divided into 13 parts and describes the Word of God, for the 13 parts of the white beard shows perfection of the Word. There are 31 curls of the beard and 390 hairs, for Psalms says: \"The per- fume of the supreme head is poured out of the beard of the father, and from there, on to the beard of Aaron.\" The black beard, of course, is the negative aspect of the white, yet both are a homogeneous part of the same whole. The beard itself hides the Supernal Triad of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, or three heads which are held together by the letters YHVH.

They cover the area of the Arik Anpin, for these are the direct emanations that enter the brain of the Zauir Anpin.

This belief, to a certain extent, contradicts the extra dimension theory (which the Golden Dawn have tended to ignore in favor of the Atziluthic system, as advo- cated by Rosenroth). Because of the confusion and complexity of this section with the Sephiroth system, some Kabbalists have considered that each section of the Figure can be broken down into ten Sephiroth and 78 \"Siphra Dtzenioutha, II Mathers translation. 19 On the night of the nuptials Leah was substituted for Rachel, unbeknown to Jacob."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"An Extra Dimension of the Tree 87 also representing a Sephirah in the greater scheme.

With this type of pre- existence concept the soul is, to a certain extent, contracted and devoid of its extensions into the realm of mankind. The Bahir refers us to the meaning of \"generation to generation\" (as given in Ecclesiastes 1:4) yet Rabbi Akiba tells us bluntly that a generation has already came or been before, stating that it is the same people and yet of another generation. 80 The quotes from the Zohar, as given in this chapter , were taken from a series of lectures given at Whare Ra temple in New Zealand. on the Kabbalistie Soul, from 1919~1921.1 found these trans- lations in an old notebook with various books and folio references of the 20har given.

Rabbi Jose tells us that these do not count and it is the last body that one has shared that will rise again at resurrection. The entire con- cept relates to the Biblical book of Genesis, where it is said that some- thing is created in physical form then returned to God on the final day. Of the actual creation itself, the Zohar says:83 As the body is made in this world from the combination of the four elements, the spirit (soul) is made in the Gar- den 84 from a combination of the four winds that are there and the spirit in them shaped in the shape of the body. This tells us that when the soul is first fashioned it is in empathy with the body. The effect of its shaping in the Garden through the four winds is analogous to the four elements on earth. In fact, one could assume that the soul is reshaped in the Garden before any re-entry into man or woman. The Zahar says:85 Blessed are the just, whose NShMThHVN, souls are drawn from that Holy Body which is called Adam, which includeth all things; the place, as it were, wherein all the Crowns and Holy Diadems are associated together, arrayed in equilibrium and balance. This concept shows that all souls were created together, even though the vast majority took their time before entry into mankind. On the question of polarity of the Soul, with the continual refer- ence to the male Adam, the Zahar says: 81 See Sepher Ha-Gilgalim or Book of Transformation. 82 Vol. 2. folio 131a. 83 Vol. 3. folio 13b. 84 This is possibly the Lower Garden of Eden and not the Upper. 85 Lesser Holy Assembly."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah Every form in which the male and female principle is not to be found is not a superior or complete form.

Thus this little world is created according to the prototype of the great world. The Zohar further states that when Adam was created he gathered the earthy materials from all over the world and made him from it, on earth. The soul is a compound of three grades or degrees. The lowest is the Nephesch, while the next is the Ruach, and the highest is the Neschamah. Each of the two lowest functions, or levels of the Soul, relies on the energies of the one above it, so that the body of man can exist with the spirit therein. It is the function of the lowest to try and unite with the highest while man is still in material form.

The flesh recalls the evil side of the universe (the purely external and tangible element) The bones and veins represent the celestial chariot, the forces that exist within, the ser- vants of God. However, all this is but a cloak; for the deep mystery of celestial man is within. Celestial Adam is as spiritual as terrestrial man, and everything happens below as it does on high. Therefore it is written in scrip- tures: \"And God created man in His own image\" yet, different figures formed by the stars and planets in the firmament that envelops us betoken hidden matters and profound mysteries-so do the figures and lines on the skin which encompasses the human body and are the body's stars and planets. All these signs have a hidden meaning and are the objects of attention of wise men who know how to read the face of man. Following the lead of the above paragraph, we find that in the Zahar 88 there are some very rigid rules of what is now called physiognomy, or the study of one's physical features to determine one's worth or charac- ter. Apart from this, there is also a discourse on palmistry.89 Within the Golden Dawn and later Alpha et Omega temples under Mathers the lec- ture on palmistry which is taken from the 2ahar. The astrological break- down of man, as given from a Golden Dawn tahulation,90 and as applied to the Kabbalistic Paths, is as shown on the following page. 91 B8 Volume 3, folios 70b· 75b. 89 Vol. 3, Falla 78. 90 This is from a document called \"Book of General Correspondences,\" which was published by Crow ley as 777. 9\\ For a more detailed tabulation see RulershlP Book by Rex E.

And above and beyond this was the Spiritual entity who used this body, who used this desire and rational consciousness. Nephesch The Nephesch is part of the Soul that directly feeds the human organism for it is said: 92 She giveth meat to her household (body) and an appointed portion oflabour to her maidens (limbs). To understand this more completely, we have to turn to Indian cul- ture and the subtle body that is called the Etheric Body, which is analo- gous to the Nephesch. The Etheric Body can be seen clairvoyantly like a series of streams or rivers covering the human body. These are called nadis, or channels, in which the energy flows from the seven chakras. Within the Order of the Stella Matutina, or in the New Zealand Temple Whare Ra at the very least, the Etheric Body was discussed almost in the same breath as the Nephesch. This eastern perspective gives new dimen- sions to the concept and opens up insights into some very cryptic Biblical passages that are quoted in the 2ohar, like the one above. The 20har tells us that the Nephesch has no light of its own and can only conform to the influence of Spiritual Light (of Metatron) above it. In many respects, this is a very accurate description of the Etheric Body, for the Zohar states that the abode of the Nephesch is in the Physical Body, and not in another dimension, such as the other component parts of the soul. Since the Nephesch is in the physical, the question may be asked, why can't we see it. The answer to this is that a number of people can see it. It has been mapped by both Indian and Chinese mystics within the formulae for Acupuncture. It can also be measured scientifically as the skin cells along the various pathways of energy differ in structure electri- cally. So, in every respect, the Nephesch is the identical twin of the phys- ical body. A careful study of the Zohar 93 will show some reference to the Nephesch actually walking around and this is explained by a distinction 92 Provo 3 us. 93 See Volume 3, Folios 142b--143a."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 95 made between the two different concepts of the Nephesch. Again, drawing an analogy with eastern theology, this is separated into the Etheric Body and the Astral Body, which is a body subtle anatomy seemingly classed by the Kabbalists in the form of the Nephesch. For the Zohar says:94 For there is a certain Nephesch which does not rest and there is a Nephesch which is not cut off from the body. The Zohar clearly states that there are both higher and lower forms of the Ncphesch, with the lower form being equated with the Etheric Body, which exists in every living creature, and the higher Nephesch, which equates with the Astral Body and which has the ability to jour- ney from one place to the next, both with and without the knowledge of the body to which it is attached. Such traveling can involve actual physical distances or psychic dimensions. The Astral Body can do both. So much has been written on this subject that there is no requirement to repeat it here. The Astral Body, or Higher Nephesch as some prefer to call it, is in fact also a plasmic body in its own right. As such, it has a certain amount of freedom. The Astral Body feeds on both pleasure and pain, and in some instances, when the individual is at either end of the spectrum, a distortion can occur where either pleasure or pain can be the main impe- tus into this body. The Astral Body then sends down its impulse through the Etheric Body and its Seven centers to the Physical Body. Distortion at this level alters the balance of the seven centers and can cause both physical and mental ill health and is rhe major cause of disease. Any form of stress build-up carried through to the Astral Body will cause it to release energy through the Solar Plexus center in rhe Etheric Body to the Physical Body, resulring in problems concerned with the area this center governs. In some cases, where extreme karma is called for, the energy or impetus is then broughr to bear on the Astral Body from rhe next level up (the Mental Body). This can be in conflict with what the Astral Body is experiencing at the moment. It may be that the Astral Body is having a very good time of it through the experiences of the physical, and all of a sudden a command comes down to change direction. As a result conflict can occur, which in turn results in disease in the physical. 94 Volume 3, Folio 142b."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"96 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn Apart from the Astral Body of the individual human being, we also have the Astral Body of various other energies that can equally affect us. One example is the Astral Body formed through groups of people and their emotions. Another is the Astral Body of the Planet Earth itself. A contributing factor here is the energies from the Zodiac which ate Astral in emanation. In group Astral energy we have the effect of various reli- gious organizations and Hermetic Orders, such as the Golden Dawn, which generates a great deal of power on the Astral level. It is this ener- gy that is tapped through ritual and pushed through to the Etheric bodies of the groups or of individuals involved in ritual work. Equinox is a par- ticularly good example, where contacts with energies and thought-forms are done through the Astral Body of the Order as a whole. This also opens the doors to individual contact. Another example of Astral energy at work through the individual is the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, which can be done either on the Etheric or Astral level, depending on the degree of competence of the operator. A good rule of thumb is that if one wishes to do either a Penta- gram or Hexagram ritual in the Astral, that is, without physical move- ment, the Astral level is then tapped and utilized. Another example of the Astral in ritual is the Vault of the Adepti in which no invocations or banishing can be done due to the fact that the Vault functions on the Astral level. To bring any form of mundane phys- ical movement into the Vault would reduce the interior energy to func- tion on the Etheric level. When in the Vault, the Adept must be able to reach and work from the Astral level so that the higher energies can be tapped. The Etheric energies do, however, exist in the Vault by virtue of its color scheme, but this is merely a web that uses the colors to draw down the Astral power. Once again, to achieve this successfully depends on the Will of the Temple Officers or Adepti and for the Etheric level is never utilized directly within the Vault. The next level to consider is the use of the Astral Body on the physi- cal plane of the Earth. By this I mean the ability to astrally travel to any part of the globe, return and give an accurate account of what is happening there, whether it be next door or the next country. The Astral Body will, during sleep, shock, or direction, actually vacate the physical body at certain times with an attachment of a silver cord to the solar plexus center of the Etheric Body. This type of voyaging with the Astral Body can be induced by"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 97 hard work, though in a number of instances it occurs involuntarily as an escape mechanism, when the force of the Mental Body is too great. This results in the Astral Body vacating its function as a form of distraction, so that it will not have to obey the higher Mental Bodywhich governs it. We now come to the complete opposite of the situation outlined in the previous paragraph, where we deal with the subject of \"Inner Space,\" a rather glib piece of terminology for psychological experiences within the psyche. \"Inner Space\" is a descriptive term thar implies falsely that all the experiences one has are internal, and hence psychological, and have nothing whatever to with the Astral Body on the astral planes. The astral planes are the level on which the Astral Body functions and travels. The astral planes are numerous, and many experiences of the mystics relate entirely to the experiences of the Astral Body. A good example of this is given in Flying Roll Number 4, by Florence Farr and Elaine Simpson, who did what could be described in today's terms as a Pathworking where a group vision is given to one or more members simultaneously from a tarot archetype. Flying Rolls numbers 11, 25, 32, and 33 also give examples of traveling and utilizing the astral planes in the Astral Body. This area also covers rhe animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms where the Astral Bodies of various animals (and people), vegetables, and minerals can be clairvoyantly contacted. The alchemists of old worked on these levels, and a very good example of this can be found at the beginning of the ancient alchemical text, the Mutus Liber. One of the dangers for the Astral Body is its overuse with the tech- nique of astral projection. This can, and has, caused mental problems, including unwelcome hallucinatory effects for some adepti. If the Astral Body has not had the chance to recover from its journey into the astral planes, then it can be overstimulated. This results in a congestion of the Etheric Body, which is unable to adjust to the new vibratory pitch that the energy and direction from the Astral Body that is being poured into it. Such congestion of this body leads, of course, to disease, whether it be physical or mental. If the Astral Body is given a chance to adjust once back in its correct environment, then one can continue with astral explo- ration of the astral planes. The Astral Body does, however, need rest and replenishment, as does any other plasmic-energy body.

The emotions are one of the most obvious aspects affected by the various astrological influences and which, in turn, influence the energy variance through the Etheric Body. One must, therefore, be careful to be in harmony with these factors through calculation before any real occult work can begin in earnest. The Nephesch, in terms of Sephirotic reference, corresponds to the Sephirah of Yesod. For Mathers says;95 The Automatic Consciousness, as it is called, is in Yesod, and has to do with the lower passions and desires. Being automatic, that is, moving of itself, it can hardly be said to be Will. Now this is the danger which threatens the man who yields to the temptations of the lower desires. The two component parts of the Nephesch, according to eastern tradition, are linked by the seven chakras. In the Golden Dawn these were never directly referred to, though in western literature the planetary influence, or whirls as they were called on the body, are well documented. It is unfortunate the Golden Dawn tended to ignore them. In the Stella Matutina, however, they were studied (within the New Zealand Temple, Whare Ra, that is), and my own training under Taylor involved a very detailed studv of what these centers represented. This is an area that Mathers could have done much with; however those he taught who went into the Stella Matutina adopted it with much vigor. The bulk of the fol- lowing section is taken from a paper called the \"Sphere of Sensation\" which I wrote some years ago for the Thorh Hermes Temple in New Zealand. I feel it takes a more balanced approach toward the Etheric Body or Lower Nephesch, and in some instances approaches it from a com- pletely different level than given in this section. 95 Flying Rotl22."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah THE SPHERE OF SENSATION96 99 The Etheric Body or Lower Nephesch Within the Outer Order the subject of the Kabbalistic Soul and its component parts was first discussed. The next phase of study for the Grade of Adeptus Major is that of the Subtle Anatomy of Man and its links to the Kabbalistic Soul. The Sphere of Sensation, or under its com- mon name, the aura, is very intricate in its nature and functions. The number of auras around the body of man has been and is always a debat- able point, but the Order teachings show that there are in fact seven in number. Of that seven there are four that are tangible (including the physical body) and three that are intangible to psychics, which corre- spond to some aspects of Eastern teachings as well. In the ritual of the 5=6 grade we are told: And being turned, I saw Seven Golden Lightbearers, and in the midst of the Lightbearers, One like Ben Adam, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt, with a Golden Girdle. There are the manifestations of the aura, each one distinct from the other that manifests from the body, shown as the empty pastas with- in the Vault. The first Auric Body that encloses itself around Guph, the physical body, under the power of the Nephesch, is the Etheric Body. Its function on a basic level is to keep the vital flows of energy that it receives from its next highest level (the Astral Body) and transmit them directly into the various energy points throughout rhe body, of which there are many. On one level it stimulates the seven major centers and the 21 senior centers, as well as the 49 subcenters. From this it stimulates the energy flows through the various meridians of body, which in turn are categorized as both major and minor influences. From this combined influence, every organ and structure of the body has its own vibrational pitch that the Etheric Body stimulates in harmony with each other. 96 For a full understanding of some of the terminology used in this paper see The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie (Llewellyn Publications)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"100 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn Within the technique of the Middle Pillar exercise we tend to charge up the Etheric body by altering its polarity, and also tend, through the help of the Kabbalistic Cross, to polarize the aura, so that the bodily centers are in fact aligned correctly in each of the Subtle Body centers. This, of course, differs from some of the Eastern teachings which advocate altering these centers directly through tone vibrations on a mantram effect. 97 While the Etheric body concentrates on passing this energy on to the physical, the Nephesch has the function of sustaining this energy through instinctive urges such as hunger, thirst, sex, and self-preservation. The Etheric Body is much like an electronic grid map that is placed on the physical body and must have a clear flow of energy to pass on to the physical body. Where this flow is interrupted, mainly by congestion, diseases are then forced through into the physical body, because the vibrational pitch of energy that keeps a tissue, cell, or organ manufactur- ing harmoniously is then prevented from achieving its range of output. Its direct links to the physical body are extremely important. The Etheric body is the regulator which must not pass too much energy into the Physical Body. This would cause the psychic channels to overload and produce overstimulation. This can manifest in many differ- ent forms of stress, particularly on the nervous system and the endocrine glands, which can, in turn, produce many blockages on the physical level. The formulation of the energy from these areas to each other (etheric body, nervous system, and glands) is the same field of energy impression that works from the Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur. The Erheric Body functions under the Kabbalistic World ofYetzirah (Yetzirah comes from the Chaldee ITzR, meaning to \"form or \"make\"). It is the world of the unconscious that also relates to the dream states of man. The main function of the Etheric Body is to receive and pass on information and energy. This applies not only from the view of a down- 97 Technically speaking, the Golden Dawn version of the Middle Pillar groups the smaller or sub- chakras together so that they handle the energy in ten divisions, but these divisions do not inter- fere directly with the seven chakras. Here the Kabbalistic meditation uses the subcenters only, which then, through the spleen center, alter the major ones indirectly. My teacher in Tantra, the late Vivandatta, nearly a quarter of a century ago in India, informed me that Westerners were better advised to approach the chakras indirectly, that is through the subcenters, as a safe method of chakra balancing. He could psychi- cally see the centers in Westerners were more in tune to the indirect approach, due to a different psychic anatomical makeup. He made the point that some races had differences in (he Erheric Body structure and alignment with the physical."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 101 ward marion, but from the view of ascent as well. Our experiences in daily life are then manifested in dream states that are passed on to the Etheric Body, where they are sometimes amalgamated, refined, and passed on to the next Astral Body. The psychological terminology that is analogous with the Etheric Body is the libido. From here the energy must be separated into a form of polarity, so both progression and regression can occur through a state of regular interaction. The Jungian concept of the libido, which we refer to here, goes beyond the original Freudian concept, which associated it with sexuality. [ung considers that it refers to \"psychic energy\" in general and warned against trying to define it too rapidly. The energy flow from the Etheric Body into the physical body relies primarily on two aspects (1) a daily flow rate which is divided into the five major Tattvic divisions,98 and (2) the energy effected by the astro- logical influences (the other effects of disease and karmic influences are not included here). The first such influence is the Akasha Tattva which is the encompassing tubular linkage (space) for the energy to flow through. Its main principle is to \"connect.\" The next division is the Vayu Tattva, which provides the pulse for the energy to flow, much in the same vein as the heartbeat of the body. The Tejas Tattva produces a stronger flow rate while the Apas Tartva provides the control mechanism that reduces the flow of energy. The Prithvi Tattva is the one that resists the flow rate of energy when the various centers of the body are full of ener- gy, and this helps to produce overstimulation. During the process of initiation either directly or indirectly into a group, or by an individual into a different field of awareness, the Etheric Body is the one that is first stimulated. In forms of ritual magic we have the temple officers slowly stimulating your Etheric Body by carefully altering its vibrational rate so that it becomes more receptive to the external stimuli of the Higher Self. This stimulation can, in some cases, produce what is called in alter- native medicine a \"healing crisis,\" in which the transition state that the Etheric Body goes through does not immediately settle on one vibrational pitch but alters until it finds its own correct accord within a new range or 98 The Tattwas are located in the Chakra centers and control the flow rates of energy going to and from it. See Narum Finer Forces by Rama Prasad for a full indcprh study of them. The Knowledge lectures on the Tartwas in the Golden Dawn were based on Prasad's book."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"102 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn pitch. If the Etheric Body is blocked or the energy is not coming through in its proper course, then the sudden alteration will cause the release of energy that can precipitate a \"healing crises\" while all the dammed-up energy finds a release. In the case of individuals, going through the grades, who have hid- den psychological disorders, it can take in some cases years to rectify. We then have the negative aspect when the Temple Officers are performing correctly and they can cause a lowering of the vitality rate which can cause psychological problems and cut off any clairvoyant ability. This has happened in the past and no doubt will happen in the future. The sexual teachings of the Golden Dawn tell us that the Etheric Body is the vehicle of attraction, for this is instinctive. When two physi- cal bodies attract each other, one often uses the phrase that they are on the \"right wavelength\" and this is true to a certain extent. This \"wave- length\" is the same vibrational pitch of both your and your partner's Erheric Bodies, which form a magnetic attraction. However, if this is just magnetic attraction, then it can sometimes be short-lived, for the pitch of the Etheric Body does not always remain the same, and when this alters then the attraction one first felt can also alter. This is because the individual you are attracted to, or even you, yourself, are undergoing con- stant changes in the Etheric Body due to the day-to-day stimuli it con- stantly faces. Karmic ties enter here, for they can override the attraction of two individuals or individuals to a group because the Higher Self has dictated that there are other things one must yet perform. In cases of one individual feeding off the energy of another, from the Etheric Body, one will find connections or shells forming from this person to the next. This is mainly because more power is available to the stronger, on the Erheric level, than the other. When one does the Pentagram Ritual in the physical (as opposed to the Astral version) or the Hexagram Ritual, then one uses the energy of the Etheric Body, and this is one of the reasons why the Pentagram has to be drawn daily to be charged for any real effect. When we have performed group ritual, or coming away from a concert, we go away feeling \"charged,\" and this is due to our Etheric Bodies adjusting to the tone vibrations and being very receptive to them. The effect of color on the individual, from a colored room, and also from color therapy, is done through the Etheric Body. A stay in the Vault of the Adepti is a good example of this, but in"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 103 the case of Vault ritual or meditations, then one progressively works through the Etheric Body to the next level which pushes forth the True Will of the Adept. Earlier I briefly touched on the aspect of attraction to members of the opposite sex, or the same sex, for rhat matter. Now we come to the realm of sex magic and its effect on the level of the Etheric Body. The orgasm and the foreplay of the sex act produce energy, and this energy can and does interfere with the flow rate of energy into the Physical Body from the Etheric Body. In most cases this burst of energy is wel- comed, for it can release certain blockages and keep tension down to a minimum. In other areas it can make the energy pattern of the Etheric Body jump into the physical and become blocked, a term which Reich has termed \"armor.,,99 The total defence apparatus of the organism, consisting of the rigidities of the characrer and the chronic spasms of the musculature, which functions essentially as a defence mechanism against the breakthrough of the emotions- primarily anxiety, rage, and sexual excitation. When the orgasm OCCUtS there is a vast increase in energy flow and tempo which washes through the various centers and circuits that lead into the physical body. Once the blockages that Reich mentions are cleared, then the energy flow is more pronounced and one is more at harmony with the self. When the Etheric Bodies of two people engaged in intercourse have simultaneous orgasm, then the two bodies interconnect with the energy going through both circuits and forming, for a brief instant, one super-circuit that produces a tremendous amount of Etheric energy. In sexual magic there are two main variables. The first is for both partners to reach orgasm at the same time and concentrate this energy up through the next auric body for a desired result, as a combined unit. The second is where one partner, whether it be male or female, uses the other's Etheric energies, and then directs these through his or her Erheric Body for the desired result. Where blood, semen, and any other bodily part is used in sex magic, then it is the Etheric Body that is being manipulated 99 See Wilhelm Reich, Selected Writings (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York. 1951)."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"104 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn to supply the energy needed. In some forms of sex magic, and indeed some forms of ritual magic, Elementals, that is, artificially created ones, can be made and invested with Etheric energy, even though their lifespan is only for a few hours at best. While part of this formula is included in the Golden Dawn's papers on talismans, it is barely the tip of the iceberg, because animals can be created, whether they be real or imaginary. The limit to their powers is with the operator, with his or her Etheric Body supplying their energy needs. Another aspect where the Etheric Body is utilized directly is in Spir- itualism, especially in cases where an ectoplasm is found. This phenome- non can, in fact, protrude a number of meters out of the physical body. In any form of magnetic healing, whether it be direct from another individ- ual or from a machine to stimulate the currents, then the Etheric Body is the one being utilized. Passes, with the hands or an elemental weapon, made over the body then work directly into the Etheric Body and create the \"wash\" effect of energy stimulating the various meridians. In acupuncture one uses this type of situation, and in forms of Taoism the deeper psychic channels are also used. These are likened to rivers of ener- gy, where the acupuncture meridians are analogous to streams. In magical works, such as in talismanic rituals, it is the energy of the Etheric Body that impregnates itself into the talisman. A good example of this in ritu- al is the use of the \"Sign of the Enterer\" and the \"Sign of Silence.\" The first stimulates the flow of the Etheric energy, while the second cancels it and is used as a checking device. The Grade Signs of the Outer Order are all working from the Etheric energy; the only difference between them is vibrational pitch and flow rate. Similarly, in color healing one has a process where the Erheric Body can be categorized into as many divisions as there are colors, though for the most part a seven- or twelve-division is normally used. These colors are closely allied with planetary and zodiac energies. It is also during ritu- al initiation that varying grades can be shown in the division of the Etheric Body and color and planetary energies can be considered a yard- stick on this. The next important aspect of ritual work and the Etheric energy is in the theory of God-form assumption.

This will be discussed in other papers relating to other auric bodies later, though for the present the basic foundation of their creative form is Ether- ic energy or energy directed from the Etheric Body. It is this energy that is felt and sometimes seen by those clairvoyant enough during ritual. THE SEVEN CENTERS The Seven centers of man, commonly called chakras (from the Sanskrit meaning \"wheel\"), are indicated on the floor of the Vault as the seven- headed dragon. Here are all the ills of man, manifested through these seven centers. By symbolically standing on them, we, in fact, control the potent and negative energies that they can introduce. On the Altar table there are the four images of the Calf, Man, Lion, and Eagle, which repre- sent the four lower centers. Because they are still on the floor, yet raised above it, they arc the lower natures of man which have been exalted so that a form of realignment or changing of their vibrational pitch occurs, which brings them into higher contact with our Higher Nature. Each of these four centers relates to an element and to the elemental grades the Adept has gone through, which in theory have also stimulated each of these four centers. The Altar itself represents what could be called the \"Eight center\" and is associated to the spleen, the energy vortex from which the energy flows, so that it can be transmitted to the seven centers on the back. The \"Eight center,\" as the Altar, is the control point for this energy. The 49 petals of the Rose and Cross at the head of the pastos (normally placed below the Altar) relate to the 49 minor centers that are under control through the four major lower centers as portrayed on the Altar. On the ceiling of the Vault we have the seven centers at their highest point and on the floor the seven centers at their lowest, with man standing in the middle trying to aspire to the highest through the influ- ences of the Seven Rays-the vault walls. Each of these chakras, save the spleen, manifests in the four auric bodies. In the Physical Body we have the seven major gland areas that act"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"106 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn as a type of receptor for these energies. In the Etheric, Astral-Emotional, and Mental Body there is a certain amount of sympathetic reaction to the seven centers as well. In the Erheric Body, these centers directly stimulate rhe physical body and receive impetus from it as well. In the next two bod- ies, the Astral-Emotional and Mental, the centers still remain, but here they are nothing but connective links to the body above and below them, with the connective links being, of course, two-way. The chakras in the Etheric Body directly relate to the Physical Body, with the psychic ramifications caused by manipulation of these centers appearing in the other auric bodies. The adept is warned against trying to place a definite planetary correspondence with each chakra, as in each center there are the influences of all of the planets and these change according to the development of each individual. The same prin- ciple also applies to color and to the centers as well. Now, as to the exact body position of these centers, they form a vortex both on the front and on the back of the body, hence the confusion of placement. The descrip- tion of the Shadow Chakras which follows shortly is formed from the same underlying principles of everything in the subtle body having a counter-part of either a higher or lower vibrational level. Base Chakra This is the lowest chakra and is situated at the base of the spine (and not at the front of the body as some have indicated). Its receptors are the adrenal glands, which also relate to the kidneys, the spinal col- umn, and part of the automatic nervous system. This chakra is made of four major vortices of energies which have been seen by some Eastern mystics as petals. In many ways this center is the control valve for the other centers for it is here that additional energy can be prematurely released through the other centers. This could result in Etheric damage, especially to the nervous system. The link is through the adreno- medullary and extra-medullary distribution of chromaffin tissue along the sympathetic nerve chains, which incidentally are the links between chakras in the physical body. Generally speaking the nervous system is the first that is stimulated directly by the Etheric energies. These in turn work the endocrine system of glands, then the blood, and from this to the various organs concerned. This center is not associated to any other pat- ticular center but, in fact with all of the others, in a primary support role."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 107 This center corresponds to the Earth element and the Biblical imagery of this is the Calf (from Revelation).

In layman's terms it is the function of this cen- ter to break down all the food processed in the body into component parts that can be correctly assimilated by the body. The corresponding center that this is associated to is the throat center. The solar plexus center is associated with the Fire element and the Biblical imagery of the Lion. Heart Chakra This center has 12 vortices associated with it and relates to the thy- mus gland and also controls the circulatory system of the body.

Throat Chakra This center has 16 vortices associated with it and relates to the thy- roid gland and controls the respiratory system. Brow Chakra This center has two major vortices associated to it and 96 smaller ones. The Brow Chakra controls the pineal gland, the sympathetic nervous system which is represented in the skull by the medulla oblongata and con- trols the sense organs.

These are shadow representations of the lower five or their etheric counterparts. In other words they function at a much higher level of the Etheric Body, which some have considered the thermal area of it. Their functions, like the lower five, are in fact more fluid and are the ones which tend to be the first manifestations of things before being sent down to the lower five. Some call these seam centers, because they have to keep the subtle bod- ies polarized so the lower main centers can function correctly. RVACH The term \"Ruach'\" means breath. The Ruach in fact rests not only on the Nephesch but within it, and rules over it. In the previous section you have seen how the Nephesch, in both its higher and lower form, is closely allied with the body, the Higher Nephesch being in fact likened to a transmission set of sorts. This is still very much the instinctive process which has to be directed through the mental or thinking process of the Ruach. lOO It has been allied with the Sephiroth of Chesed to Hod and some have considered that the influences of those planets attributed to those Sephiroth are also analogous but this is something of an under- statement. The Ruach is in many ways the sum total of the individual before he has sent the actions of his thoughts and reason down through the Nephesch to the Guph. From the psychological viewpoint, the Ruach is, of course, the col- lective components of the Psyche. [ung breaks down the Psyche into sen- sation, thinking, feeling, intuition, memory, subjective functions, effects, and invasions, which are all allied to the Ruach. I have always thought that the Ruach is in many respects more psychological than Spiritual, though the spiritual direction it takes must not be ignored. While one function of the Ruach is to digest the emanations from above that are woven into some type of karmic destiny, the other part also digests the information the individual experiences through the senses and thinking process. In many respects this is a two-way communication system, for its function is to assimilate the experience of life itself. 100 Vol. i. folio 287b, Appendix L"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 109 The ZOhaT informs us 101 that the Ruach actually leaves the body at the New Moon and feast days, then returns to its place. This suggests a very interesting astrological influence on the soul of man, as generally most of the Hebrew festivals are based on astrological events. The soul is said to leave the body on the Sabbath as well, which, apart from its religious sig- nificance, shows that it must be continually replenished every seven days. The subtle anatomy that is allied to the Ruach is the Mental Body. It is in this area that the scattered mental thoughts flow and group them- selves into various subdivisions which are separated yet again, forming in the Astral-Emotional Body. It is here that the universal energies have to adapt to suit themselves to the vibration and pitch of the lower bodies and make sure that the energy that is incoming will nor disrupt or burn out the lower layers, especially the end result on the physical body. The Mental Body is the home of the abstract concept, where it is \"conditioned\" briefly before it goes down to the Emotional leveL There it is subdivided according to the personality. More than any other level, we try to \"discover the cause of ignorance\" through the pulsation vehicle of the soul and the lesser formulations that govern the Mental Body. Its function is to try to control the pulsation system; it feeds the Astral- Emotional Body which tends sometimes to be a law unto itself due to the day-to-day reactions it has to deal with. In short, one of the main func- tions of the Mental Body is to \"control\" the Astral-Emotional Body, and, as a result, a continuous battle emerges, which will continue to carry on unabated until the Mental Body has properly aligned the Astral-Emo- tional Body and is in full control of it. Meditation is one such way that the Mental Body tries to get its way and in many instances succeeds, though meditation, however, should be an ongoing thing, for if there is a brief respite before the Astral-Emotion- al Body will try to seek dominance. Initiation is yet another way that the Mental Body seeks control. Here the self is opened up to Higher Energies that must be rationalized correctly through the Mental Body, or a type of burnout will occur. In this way the Astral-Emotional Body is cornered and must submit to the Higher Mental Body. In the Mental Body, the Thought Forms that occur are completely on the subconscious level, and because of this some thought forms, due to 101 Volume 3, folio 141b."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"110 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn polarity, can manifest negativity which can cause many mental problems. Thought forms come to us in three fundamental directions. The first is from the Higher Self, which dictates our life's journey and the karmic des- tinies to be carried out. The second is the influence of other thought forms, group or otherwise, that can also influence this body. Finally, there is impetus that is received from the Emotional Body which is gained from our life experiences and which can slightly alter the initial frequency the Mental Body puts out. Normally the first takes predominance, while the second and third are limited in their input. Within occultism the first and second aspect are considered most, for here things are done on an entirely unconscious level-a level which gives the barest hint to the conscious mind. \"Purity,\" that word which is debated so much, relates to the purity of mind, and that means the puri- ty of all the other bodies. Unfortunately the seat of daily life on the con- scious level is in the Astral-Emotional Body, and this has more often than not got in the way of the Higher thought forms filtering through when the bodies are not in alignment. Carl lung once stated that the main pur- pose of psychology is to bring the unconscious under conscious control, and in essence this is the goal of auric body alignment and of the unifica- tion of the varying stages of the Kabbalistic Soul. Neschamah 10 2 This is the highest of three levels of the soul and in it there are three divisions (counting the Neschamah itself). Mathers says: Neschamath is either plural of Neschamah, defectively written, or else shows that Neschamah is in regimene to Chiim, and evidently means the united higher souls of bothAdam and Eve conjoined in one body. 103 The Neschamah is analogous to pure spirit and can be likened to the Jungian approach of the anima (corresponding to the Neschamah) and animus (corresponding to the Chiah). Applied Kabbalistically to the Partsufim theory, the anima is the Great Mother or Heh Force and 102 The spelling of this seems to differ considerably in the Golden Dawn, with people like Mathers spelling it a number of different ways. I have opted for this spelling throughout this text, except where direct quotes are involved.

There is also some contradiction in the application of the Chiah and the still higher form of the Yechi- dah to the Kabbalistic Soul, and the two latter phases of the soul are mentioned only in the \"Faithful Shepherd\" portion of rhe Zahar. 104 The confusion exists because the Chiah and Yechidah have also been asso- ciated with the Ruach. The Golden Dawn, however, opted for the five parts of the sou]. The Higher Mental body is the Neschamah, the Chiah is the Causal Body, with the Yechidah as the highest point or Spirit. The three bodies mentioned here are in reality separated by a type of gulf from the four lower bodies and this type of analytical approach is very difficult in these areas as the Zahar has very little, if anything on them. The Soul and Death Before we discuss the actual function of the three degrees of the Soul at and after death, the spirit or channel that binds the soul should also be looked at. This is called the Zelem, and its shape is said to resem- ble that of the body, or Nephesch. The Zelem, according to the Loriahi- an concept, has three parts, one is the main energy force and the other two are similar to auric envelopes which are called Makifim, Before the appointed time of death both of the Makifim of the Neschamah withdraw from the body and go to their appointed place, then the Ruach and Ncphesch, over a 30-day period. This Zoharic teaching is similar to that of Edgar Cayce, the great American psychic, who stated on more than one occasion that those people he saw who died a short time later had no visible aura. Not only Cayce but other psychics, such as Arthur Ford, have also made similar statements that seem to parallel the teachings of the Zahar with the term \"aura\" being used instead of the word \"soul.\" The time scale of the withdrawal of the Zelem of the Neschamah depends on the individual. Some people have, well before the time of death, allowed the Ruach to withdraw into the Neschamah. In very highly evolved indi- viduals this has the effect that both Ruach and Neschamah are one (this would make the withdrawal a lot less than 30 days). In this instance the Nephesch is clearly very highly evolved, and after the death of the body there is no decomposition.

Besides the example of the body of Joseph, we also have hard phys- ical evidence of this situation occurring in some Catholic saints, where decomposition does not occur. The soul, or shell of it, remains (for us mere mortals) in the body till the moment of death for this is the sum total of the personality and it must have the three phases functioning cor- rectly for it to function at all. Since the Zelem has gone, the energy for this is drawn from the shell of the Neschamah, which has stored power prior to the death just for this purpose, before the Zdem withdraws. Without it, the body would not be able to function through any of the senses. In the Talmud are listed in excess of 900 different kinds of death, from the easiest to the most painful. The Yechidah has, before death, certain functions to carry out and these are done in the world of Briah. Some of these functions are prepara- tory and depend on the type of life lead by the individual. The Yechidah must also find a place for the Ruach, and this level or place is determined by the Ruach's actions during the previous life on earth. For we are told in the Zahar 106 that if the Neschamah is prevented from attaining the place set aside for it, then the Ruach and Nephesch cannot enter the Garden of Eden. It must then roam the various planes and experience fur- ther suffering by observation until the Most High has considered that it can then enter its abode, which of course opens the door for the Ruach, as well, to rest in the world of Yetzirah. Although the Zahar is not clear on this point, the three phases of the soul can be considered to occur in the Gehinnon (a type of Hell associated with the Catholic concept ofPurga- tory). It is in cases like this that supernatural occurrences of the most unpleasant kind occur. For Job 25:22 says: But flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn. 105 Vol. 3, folio 141b. 106yol. 3, folio 141a."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 113 At the moment of death the Nephesch, in its lower form as the Etheric Body, ceases to exist and disintegrates and this is the decomposi- tion state.

Since it now has a Ruach to give it impetus, it ends up in what might be called a wandering state. Some have considered that the Gehinnon is merely a state away from the Most High and hence the Nephesch, along with the Ruach and Neschamah, wanders until it meets with the Yehudiam, or angelic messenger, who takes it to the Garden of Eden where is reunited with its source. ADAM KADMON AND HIS SOVLSl07 Thou shalt know that the whole Sphere of Sensation which surroundeth the whole physical body of a man is called \"The Magical Mirror of the Universe.\" For therein are represented all the occult forces of the Universe projected as on a Sphere, con- vex to the outer, but concave to man. This sphere surroundeth the physical body of a man as the Celestial Heavens do the body of a Star or Planet, having their forces mirrored in its atmosphere. Therefore its allotment or organisation is a copy of the Greater World or Macrocosm. In this \"Magical Mirror of the Universe,\" therefore, are the Ten Sephiroth projected in the form of the Tree of Life as in a solid sphere. A man's physical body is within the Ten Sephirorh project- ed in a Sphere. The divisions and parrs of the body are formed from the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, thus. 108 Kether is above the Crown of the Head, and represents a crown which indeed is powerful, but requires one worthy to wear it.

For the higher will to manifest, it must be reflected into the lower will by Neschamah. This lower will is immediately potent in the lower membranes and thus, in the region above the heart, is the lower will seated like a King of the body upon its throne. The concentration of the other faculties of the Ruach in and under the presidency of the Will, at the same time reflect- ing the administrative governance of Chokmah and Binah, is what is called the human consciousness. That is, a reflection of the two creative Sephiroth under the presidency of the Four Elements, or the reflection of Aima and Abba as the parents of the human Jehovah. But the human Neschamah exists only when the higher Will is reflected by the agency of aspiration from Kether into the lower body, and when the flaming letter Shin is placed like a crown on the Head of Microprosopus. Thus only doth the human will become the receptacle of the higher Will and the action of Neschamah is the link there- with. The lower will is the human Jehovah-an angry and jealous God, the Shaker of the Elements, the manifestor in the life of the body. Bur illuminated by the higher Will, he becometh Yeheshuah, no longer angry and jealous, but the self-sacrificer and the Atoning and Reconciling One. This as regards the action of the more physical man. Unto this Ruach also are presented the reflections of the Macrocosmic Universe in the Sphere of Sensation. They sur- round the Ruach which, in the natural man, feeleth them but vaguely and comprehendeth them not. The faculties of the Earth are shown forth in the organs which digest and putrify, casting forth the impurities, even as the Earth is placed above the Qlippoth.

This Air, the Ruach, perrneaterh the whole physical body but its concentrated influence is about the heart. Yet, were it not for the boundary force of Chokmah and Binah above, of the sphere of sensation surrounding it, and of Maikuth below, the Ruach could not concentrate under the presidency of the Name, and the life of the body would cease. Thus far concerning the Ruach as a whole, that is, the action of the Will in Tiphareth. From Netzach and Hod are formed the thighs and legs, and they terminate in the symbols of five, as do the arms; but they are not so moveable, owing to the effect of Malkuth. In them are placed the faculties of support and firmness and bal- ance; and they show the more physical qualities of the Ruach. They are the affirmation of the 'Pillars of the Sephi- roth, as answering to the passive, the arms more answering to the two pillars which are Active. They are the columns of the Human Temple. From Yesod are formed the generative and excretory organs, and therein is the seat of the lower desires, as bearing more on the double nature of, on the one hand, the rejection of the Qlippoth, and on the other hand the simulacrum of the vital forces in Tiphareth. It is the special seat of the auto- matic consciousness. That is, not the Will, but the simulacrum of the Will in Tiphareth. Yesod is the lowest of the Sephiroth of the Ruach, and representerh \"Fundamental Action.\" It therefore governeth generation. In Yesod is therefore the automatic consciousness or simulacrum of the Will. This automatic consciousness is to the Nephesch what the Daadi action is to the Ruach.

The Physical Body is permeated throughout by the rays of the Ruach, of which is the material completion. The Nephesch shineth through the material Body and formeth the Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation. This Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensa- tion is an imitation or copy of the Sphere of the Universe. The space between the physical and the boundary of the sphere of Sensation is occupied by the ether of the astral world; that is to say, the container or recipient of the Astral Rays of the Macrocosm. The Nephesch is divided into its seven Palaces, combining the Sephirotic influences in their material forms. That is, the world of passions dominated by the Ruach, or by the world which is beyond. That is, its Sephiroth are passionate, express- ing a passionate dominion. Thus its three Supernal Sephirorh, Kether, Chokmah and Binah, are united in a sense of feeling and comprehending impressions. Its Chesed is expressed by a laxity of action. Its Geburah by violence of action. Its Tiphareth is expressed by more or less sensual contemplation of beauty, and love of vital sensation. Its Hod and Netzach, by physical well-being and health. Its Yesod, by physical desires and gratifications. Its Malkuth, by absolute increase and dom- ination of matter in the material body.

Shining through infinite worlds, and darting its rays through the confines of space, in this Sphere of Sensation is a faculty placed even as a light is placed within a lantern.

That is, in the ordinary natural man when awake, the thought acteth through the Ruach, subject when there to the action of the Lower Will, and submitted to the reasoning power derived as foresaid from Chokmah and Binah. But in the ordinary man when sleeping, and in the mad- man, the idiot, and the drunkard, the process is not quite the same. In the sleeping man, the concentration of the Ruach in his heart during the waking time hath produced a weakening of the action of the Ruach in its subsidiary Sephiroth in the Physical Body. To preserve the salutary conjunction of the Ruach with the Nephesch in the physical body (whose limits are fixed by the Sephiroth of the Ruach) it is necessary to weaken the concentration in Tiphareth to repair the strain which is produced by the concentration of the Ruach therein during the waking state. This reflux of the Ruach into its sub- sidiary Sephiroth produceth naturally a weakening of the Lower Will; and the Ruach, therefore, doth not reflect so clearly the Reasoning Faculty. Wherefore, the thought of the spiritual consciousness reflecteth the image in a c~nfused series, which are only partially realized by the Lower Will. (This is as regards the ordinary natural man in sleep.) In the madman, as considered apart from obsession (thought-obsession is frequently the accompaniment of mania and still more frequently its cause), the thought and lower will are very strongly exercised to the detriment of the reasoning faculty. That is, that there is an alliance between the two for- mer which overpowereth the action of Chokmah and Binah in the latter. Monomania is shown in the consideration of only one cer- tain symbol which is too attractive to the Will. A chain of thought is simply a graduated vibration arising from the con- tact of a ray of thought with a symbol. If controlled by reason- ing power and licensed by the Will, such vibrations will be balanced and of equal length. But if uncontrolled by the Lower Will and the Reason, they will be unbalanced and inharmo- nious. (That is, of uneven length.) In the case of the drunkard, the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation and consequently of the Nephesch, is disturbed. In consequence the thought rays are shaken at each vibration, so that the sphere of sensation of the Nephesch is caused to rock and waver at the extremities of the physical body where the Ruach action is bounded.

Nearly the same may be said of Seasickness, and the action of certain drugs. Restoration of the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation after this naturally produceth a slackening of the concentra- tion of the Ruach in Tiphareth, whence sleep is an absolute necessity to the drunkard. This is so imperative that he cannot fight against the need. If he does so, or if this condition be constantly repeated, the thought rays are launched through the Sphere of Sensation so irregularly and so violently that they pass its boundary without either the Lower Will or the Reasoning Power or even the Thought itself consenting there- to; and the latter is therefore without the protection of the will. Thence arise the conditions of delirium tremens, and an opening is made in the Sphere of Sensation which is unguard- ed, and through which hostile influence may enter.

All thought action in the spiritual consciousness originarerh in radiation, and radiation is as inseparable from the spiritual consciousness as it is from Light.

It is therefore the Lower Genius or Viceroy of the Higher Genius which is beyond. an Angel Mighty and Terri- ble. This Great Angel is the Higher Genius, beyond which are the Archangelic and Divine. Recall the Tiphareth clause of an Adeptus Minor: \"1 further solemnly promise and swear that with the divine permission I will from this day forward apply myself unto the Great Work which is so to purify and exalt my spiritual nature, that with the Divine Aid I may at length attain to be more than Human, and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my High- er and Divine Genius, and that in this event, 1 will not abuse the great power entrusted unto me.\" Note that this clause answereth unto Tiphareth, seeing that it is the Lower Will that must apply itself unto this work, because it is the King of the Physical Man. All the Shining Ones (whom we call Angels) are microcosms of the Macrocosm Yetzirah, even as Man is the microcosm of the Macrocosm of Assiah.

SHEKINAH 110 THE FEMININE FACE OF GOD 123 Possibly one of the most confusing theories within Kabbalistic teaching is that of the Shekinah. Within the Golden Dawn's Outer Order the Shek- inah, or more simply the female aspect of the deity, is only briefly men- tioned. A number of the Order's critics have often felt that the Order was too patriarchal. This applies, if at all, however, only to the levels up to the Inner Order, for the rituals of the 6=5 upwards are under the guidance of the Shekinah or Matrona as it is sometimes called, and the apparent patriarchal aspect is then reversed. To describe the function of the Shekinah is very difficult because many of the mystics, who recorded seeing the Shekinah, found that it appeared on many different levels and this is the point of confusion. The Shekinah is very closely allied, though not identical with the soul, both on individual and group levels. Its relationship with the soul is close and strong, not unlike that between womb and fetus, for the Shekinah is the aspect of God that cradles and nurtures the soul. It is also called Eden (the Upper Eden). In the Zohar lll we are introduced to the Shekinah in the feminine word \"mihalekh,\" which is the voice of God heard in the Garden of Eden \"in the coolness of the day.\"1l2 When applied to the tribes of Israel, the Shekinahguided them in Exodus 13:21. A reference to this guidance is also found in Psalms (85:13) where it states that \"the Just One goes before him and shall deliver him from his steps,\" which also 110 This word refers to something dwelling within. 111 Part 1, folio 76a."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"124 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn relates to Exodus. The first separation of the Shekinah occurred during the Deluge. The Lesser Hecaloth text tells us that the first generation denied the Lord and went to idol-worshipping, and the only man worthy of being saved was Enoch, 112 who was taken up into the heavens with the Shekinah. Once removed from the earth, rhen the destruction began, and man had to begin all over again. The Shekinah in man in the second generation was a separate entity in itself and divided. The Four Kerubs are the Throne on which the Shekinah rests. This notion of the cleaving of the Spirit associated with the Shek- inah is not confined to its active part in guiding the Tribes ofIsrael. It can also be found in the association of the Shekinah and the Torah which was was written under her influence. Once the Torah is truly understood then one is in direct contact with the Shekinah. At this point we have the Shekinah manifesting on two levels. The first is the higher echelon or upper level of Eden, and the second is the influence of the Law. The experience of the Shekinah manifesting as guide during Exodus actually comes through the understanding of the Torah. At this point there is not really a separation from the masculine concept of deity, for God is Elohim, both masculine and feminine, and the Shekinah shone through and led them through the Torah. There are some early references to the Shekinah in Kabbalistic texts but the first one of any substantial importance is in the Bahir where the analogy is with the Matrona in the King's chamber, who could not be seen by her children, for she was hidden. The analogy here is considered by some to be the development of the Sephiroth, with the Shekinah being allotted to Binah, while the children are the seven lower Sephi- roth, who are cut off from the Mother by the Abyss. We are told in the Zohar 11 4 that the Lord God Jehovah is plural, for he is also called Elohim, showing up the feminine source within. On a more personal level, the Shekinah is often referred to as an angel. She was the angel that appeared to Moses,115 although to Jacob 1l 6 she appeared as Rachael, 117 and to Abraham she was Adonai. 1l 8 The Zobar states 119 that the Shekinah abides in all women, and man can come to know the Shekinah through a wife, but fails if he has none. For in all true matrimonial unions the 112 Genesis 3:8. 113 Both Enoch and Meratron art: considered the same in some texts. 114 Pan 2, folio 161 b-162a."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Soul of the Kabbalah 125 Shekinah hovers overhead between husband and wife. 120 The Shekinah is also the Union of Metatron (the male) and Sandalphon through the central pillar of the Tree of Life. Some Kabbalistic authors, such as Waite, have ascribed the Middle Pillar to the Shekinah, but this I feel is an error. The Middle Pillar is a sheath that allows the energies of the Shekinah to unite so Elohim is formed. l21 A good analogy here is with Kundalini Yoga. The spine for the Shekinah is aligned with Shatki, the energy that resides in the base of the spine, and closely allied with Malkuth. This energy then works its way up the spine through two channels, Ida and Pingala, releasing her energy at various stops or chakras and striving for the union in the godhead. III The Talmud informs us that man and his Shekinah were separated when Adam left Eden \"enthroned above a cherub under the Tree of Life, her splendour being 65,000 times greater than the sun.\" The Shekinah then followed Adam and will continue to do so until he has achieved his rightful place back in the Garden of Eden. 115 Part 5, folio 187a. 116 In Genesis 48,16 we are told \"me angel which redeemeth me from evil,\" uttered by Jacob. 117 See the Countenance section to fully explain this. 113 Who was said to have descended from the second heaven. 119 Part 2, folio 228b. 120 Talmud Shabbarh 55b; Bereshtrh Rabba 98,4 ere. 121 I must agree with Shuster in his book Crowley's Apprentice, page 121, where he gives a description of the dual polarity in the Middle Pillar. a point Francis King feels is nor valid in his Tantra Far Westerner.

The second head is Gihon, the River of Waters, flowing into Chesed. The third is Hiddekel, the River of Air flowing into Tiphareth. And the fourth river which receiveth the virtue of the other three is Euphrates which floweth down upon Malkuth the Earth. This river going forth out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, of the Waters of Life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and the Lamb, on either side of which was the Tree of Life bearing 12 manner of fruit. And thus do the Rivers of Eden form a Cross, and on that Cross the great Adam the Son who was to rule Nations with a rod of iron is extended from Tiphareth and his arms are stretched out to Gedulah and Geburah. And in Malkuth is Eve, the completion of All, the Mother of All, and above the Universe she supporteth with her hands the Eternal Pillars of the Sephiroth.\" The Golden Dawn approach, from this description, is a combina- tion of the traditional Judaic and the Christian. The Zohar 123 tells us that God planted Man, as Israel, in the Lower Garden of Eden, 124 from which man was formed from the Middle column, along with Eve, as two distinct entities from the single source that would never be separated, the branch- es of the Tree being the purity and guardians ofYHVH's teaching. Only when the teaching is accepted by mankind (as Israel) will the knowledge and benefits of the fruits of knowledge, being born in Malkuth at the base of the Tree of Life, benefit everyone, as from this fruit all will eat, from the one Tree. As shown by the diagram on page 126, Metatron (or Enoch) came down from the Supernal Eden to the Lower Eden to protect it from the Qlippoth who were trying to climb to the source of Light. The problem was that the vessels of the Sephiroth were formed from Chaos or Tohou and were imperfect, and could not hold the light emanating from above. l2J Part I. folio 25a-26b, was the basts of this Mathers explanation of the Garden of Eden before the Fall. 124 The Garden is the Shekmah on earth while Eden is the Supernal Mother, two levels of the Shek- inah in one fonn."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Garden of Eden 129 In many respects, it could be said that since the vessels 1Z5 were the androgyny of Adam and Eve, that they were made imperfect. Therefore they could not mate to perpetuate the species. It appears that they could have carried on their own existence though rhis would have got mankind itself nowhere fast. The separation of the female from the male was the force that shattered the vessels and also prevented them from knowing God as they once did when they were a complete form. This was the ban- ishment, the lack of knowledge with God that they once had, that was the Fall of Man, for they left the Garden of Eden through a lack of com- munion with the Divine. This did not happen overnight, nor in the 42 days as given by Jacob Boehme, but over a period of time. Going to a completely different type of approach, it appears that man, in the beginning, had control of the shaping of his body, or was not yet quite flesh. In Genesis we find Adam saying 12 6 \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.\" Psychics such as Edgar Cayce have stat- ed that man in this early time was much aligned to semi-matter, and once the flesh was formed so was the urge to procreate, and the sexual urge between Adam and Eve began to polarize. 127 The Qlippoth that Meta- tron l 2 8 had to protect them from was in fact the pull of the earth and its desires in the material form, for this pull made them more dense, and as such, they lost their state as energy or semi-energy. Metatron was a man who could rise above the power of the material and could guide the oth- ers to follow in his footsteps. The Zohar states that Adam and Eve ate from the vine and suggests procreation attempts that were made were unsuccessfull/\" at first. It may be, however, that they were simply not ready for it, for they themselves had not yet fully formed, let alone could they procreate themselves. 125 The Torah considers these vessels the Kmgs of Edom, though this theory will be dealt with in the Garden of Eden after the Fall. 126 Genesis 2:23 127 See Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament hy Robert Krajenke (Edgar Cayce Foundation, 1973). 128 Who is also associated with Adam or a form of him. 129 Part 1, folio 192a."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"130 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn The Garden of Eden THE GARDEN OF EDEN The Golden Dawn description of this diagram is as follows: The outer circle is the enclosing Paradisiacal Wall guard- ed by the Kerubim and the Flame, and the seven Squares are the Seven Mansions thereof, or the Seven Spheres, wherein Tetragrammaton Elohim planted every Tree which is pleasant and good for food, symbolized by the Palm Trees on the Veil of the Tabernacle, and the Door"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Garden of Eden of the Holy of Holies in the Temple.

GARDEN OF EDEN AFTER THE FALL The Golden Dawn concept of the Garden of Eden after the Fall 132 does not follow the continuity of the Garden of Eden before the Fall. The problem that Mathers faced was that there were a number of different Zoharic viewpoints of it. 133 Prior to the Fall he used a combination of two different concepts and did the same with that of \"after the Fall,\" which primarily came form the Idra Sutra. 134 As Mathers explains it: 135 Ere the Eternal instituted the Formation, Beginning and End existed not.

It is the heaven of discrimination for the stores kept here will be unleashed on the ungodly and it closely resembles the influ- ence of Geburah which it is allied to. This is very much the sphere of the Law and retribution and is said to be the abode of Moses, Isaac and Jacob. When punishment is inflicted from this heaven, the Prophets who guard this heaven try to protect the righteous. It is basically a position of the Talmud differing from that of the Zohar 15 3 on its functions. 15 4 Since the Heav- ens are a reflection of the energies of the Sephiroth it would appear that Talmudic consideration seems more appropriate. 5. MAHON - meaning \"dwelling\" and is related to Tiphareth. The Talmud says that this heaven is the home of the Minister- ing angels who sing the praise of YHVH during the day and rest during the night so that the songs of the day will be with man during sleep as well. When Moses viewed this heaven he saw angelic combinations of both Fire and Ice working togeth- er in harmony. These were the Erelim,155 who are also called the Ishim.P? This harmony, of course, relates to the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life where the polar opposites merge. 4. ZEBUL - meaning \"habitation,\"157 relates to the Sephirah of Netzach. According to the Talmud, it relates to the Celestial Temple of Jerusalem where high sacrifices are made. When Moses saw this heaven his vision was of a Temple with columns of red and green fire and halls of sparkling gems. The angelic hosts of this level govern all those stars and planets in the heavens. 3. SHEHAKIM - meaning \"clouds of glory\" is analogous to the Sephirah of Hod.

Israel Regardie was one of the first 16 7 to state the principles of alchemy in pure- ly psychological terms and his book, The Philosophers Stone, which he published in 1938, actually predating the work on similar lines by Carl [ung published in his Psychology and Alchemy, 168 and Mysterium Coruunc- tionis.

Jewish Alchemy had been referred to by notable authors such as Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Phiiaierhcs) yet the Aesch Mezareph was the first co put it into some sort of prospectus. In the Zora: proper there are some references to alchemi- cal concepts,172 but these are fragmented. In the Preface to the Aesch Mezareph, Westcott says: The Aesch Mezareph or Ash Metzareph, is only known to persons of Western Culture from the Latin translation found in a fragmentary condition in the work entitled Kabala Denudaw by Knorr von Rosenroth, published at Salzbach in 1677-84. These volumes have a subtitle \"Transcendental, Metaphysical and Theological Doctrines of the Hebrews,\" and they enshrine a Latin translation, with part of the Hebrew text and commentaries of the great Sohar or Zohar, \"Book of Splendour.\" The Aesch Mezareph is still extant as a separate treatise in what is called the Hebrew language, but which is more properly Aramaic Chaldee: it was a companion volume to the Cha/dean Book of Numbers so often referred to by H. P. Blavatsky. There is no doubt that the Aesch Mezareph comes from the first vol- ume of Rosenroth's work, which is in the form of a Lexicon, 173 and that it was fragmented and put into a single book form by The Lover of Philalethes in English in 1714. It has been suggested by numerous authors that this text is not a course in practical alchemy, but more of a discourse in rhetoric. Over the years I have had an opportunity of discussing this work from a practical viewpoint with a number of alchemists and am told that 171 For a study on the practical side of alchemy as applied to this text sec Hermetic Journal, vo1.14 1 \"The Alchemical Tree of Life,\" by Rafal T.

While various authors have discussed how alchemy and the Kabbalah are related or not related, I have never seen any mention of the association of alchemy with one of the oldest of all the Kabbalistic books, when to my mind it is the most obvious. The previous section on the Aesch Mezareph has dealt with alchemy from the Sephirotic viewpoint, and now it is time to look at alchemy as seen from the PATHS-the Sephiroth are excluded. The concept we are going to look at is very simplistic and involves alchemical steps or stages in a three-, seven- and twelvefold system. Three-Stage System of Alchemy The Sepher Yetzirah says: These Three Mothers did He produce and design. and com- bined them; and He sealed them as the three mothers in the Universe, in the year and in Man-both male and female. He caused the letter Aleph to reign in Air and crowned it, and combining it with the others He sealed it, as Air in the World. as the temperate (climate) of the Year, and as the chest (the lungs for breathing Air) in Man: the male with Aleph, Mem and Shin, the female with Shin, Mem and Aleph. He caused the letter Mem to reign in Water, crowned it, and combining it with the others formed the earth in the world, cold in the year, and the belly in man, male and female, the former with Mem, Aleph, Shin, the latter with Mem Shin, Aleph. He caused Shin to reign in Fire, and crowned it, and combining it with the others, sealed with it the heavens and the universe, heat in the year and the head in man, male and female. Now at this point there is no indication which came first, just that there were three letters, each with its respective territory. These three letters then send their rays to the seven and the twelve letters. The Three letters correspond to the Three basic steps in alchemy which cover the process as a whole. These are the process of Separation, Purifi- cation, and Cohobation."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"164 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn 1. Aleph is the process of Separation of the Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury (regardless of the Kingdom concerned), the Three Vital Essences of the process. 2. Shin is analogous to the process of Purification, which takes the three components' parts and purifies them to a very high degree. 3. Mem is linked to the process of Cohobation, which is a series of successive distillations which unify the Three Principles of Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury and bring their vibration rate to the level required. If these three stages are applied to a practical application, such as the making of a herbal alchemical tincture, they can be applied very gen- erally, in the following manner. 1. Rectified or distilled alcohol is poured in a glass jar partly full of fresh herbs. This is the first stage of the Separation process (called Maceration) as the alcohol causes the oil to separate from the main body of the plant and float to the top. After a period of time the alcohol, that contains the Sulphur (oil), is then drained off into a distillation apparatus; then distillation takes place, thus separating the alcohol (Mercury) from the oil (Sulphur). 2. Purification occurs when the plant which had the alcohol drained from it is calcined to a white powder (salt) over a direct heat source. This is also where the Sulphur is evaporat- ed to a hard substance and then calcined as above. 3. Cohobation is when the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt are com- bined in a laboratory apparatus {such as a soxhlet) for further use, or simply placed together, which then forms the end result of the experiment, in this instance a tincture which is ready to be used for medicinal purposes. 131 The Golden Dawn also adapted the Tarot Trump \"Blasted Tower\" to this theme. 138 Pan 1, folio 54-55a."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Alchemy and the Kabbalah 165 Seven-Stage System of Alchemy These relate to the Double Letters and are in fact a further refine- ment of the above three-stage generalization, arranged in this order: Let- ter - Stage - Planet 1. Peh - Calcination - Mars Calcination is the process of reducing the size of the material worked with (Prima Materia-first matter) by fire, through four stages which can be seen by the color of the matter ar each stage: The Blackening, Whitening, Yellowing, and Red- dening. The first stage, the Blackening, is obtained by direct burning, while the other three stages are through the process of a consistent heat. Through this process pulverization occurs and impurities are removed which makes the matter ready for the next step. 2. Kaph - Sublimation - Jupiter Sublimation takes place when the matter is placed in a con- tainer (usually made of glass with a long neck above it) over a heated element. The vapor or essence is then extracted from the matter and remains in the top of the neck for a short time, then descends back down the tube to the matter (which is at the bottom of the flask) from which it was derived. This step actually covers the steps of separation and exaltation in alchemy. Part of the essence is taken from the matter, strengthened, then returned to it, changing the matter in its composition. 3. Daleth - Solution - Venus Solution is the aspect when the matter is dissolved in the liq- uid as a result of the previous step of sublimation. 4. Gimel- Putrefication - Moon Putrefication, to a certain extent, is still part of the dissolution process, where great care must be taken that the matter being dissolved must be stopped at a certain point in the experiment when complete separation has occurred, for at this critical level an entirely new substance has been formed or transmuted. 5.

To these signs are allotted the tribes of Ephraim, Judah, Dan and Reuben, who, as we shall presently see, encamped towards the Cardinal Points around the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and as the leaders of the others. The signs of the Twins, the Fishes, and in a certain sense as a compounded figure,178 the Centaur armed with a bow, are called bi-corporate or double-bodied signs. To these refer Manasseh, Simeon, and Benjamin. Manasseh was divided into two half-tribes with separate possessions (being the only tribe thus divided), and thus answers to the equal divisions of the sign of the Twins, Castor and Pollux, the Great Twin Brethren. Simeon and Levi are classed together, like the two Fishes in the Sign, but Levi is withdrawn later, to form as it were the binding and connecting link of the Tribes, as the priestly caste. Benjamin is the younger brother of Joseph, for Rachael had only these two sons, and is the only one of the Sons of Jacob who at his birth was called by two names, for Rachael called him \"Ben oni,\" but his father Ben- jamin, and in the Sign of X the two natures of Man and Horse are bound together in one symbol. We shall find much light upon the connection between the Signs and the Tribes shown by the blessings of Jacob, and of Moses, from the former of which the Armorial bearings of the Twelve Tribes are derived. Let us note also that as in the Tribes Levi was withdrawn, and the two Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh substituted for the simple one of Joseph, so in the New Testament, Judas is with- drawn from the number of the twelve Apostles and his place filled by another, Matthias, who is chosen by lot to fill his place. The following is the order by birth, of the children of Jacob: Leah bore Reuben; Simeon; Levi, afterwards withdrawn, and Judah. Bilhah (Rachel's maid) bore Dan and Naphtali. Zilpah (Leah's maid) bore Gad and Asher. Leah again bore Issachar, Zebulon and Dinah (a daughter).

Save the Kerubic emblems the arrangement seems at first very confused, but when we notice the Maternal Ancestors of the Tribes, this confusion disperses, and we notice that at the East are three tribes descended from Leah, viz. Judah, Issaehar, and Zebulon. Opposite to them, towards the West, three tribes descended from Rachel, viz. Ephraim, Manasseh and Benjamin. At the South are two descended from Leah, and one descended from Zilpah, viz. Reuben, Simeon and Gad, and at the North, two descended from Bilhah and one descended from Zilpah; viz. Dan, Naphrali and Asher. Here two Tribes descended from Zilpah, Gad, and Asher, are the only ones separated, and placed in opposition to each other, for these ate the two signs of the Equinoxes. The substitution of the two tribes of Ephraim and Man- asseh for the single one ofJoseph is given in Genesis 48, where Jacob blessed them prior to the general blessing of the Tribes, stating at the same time that Ephraim, though the younger, should take precedence over Manasseh; And Jacob said unto Joseph ... And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine.

We shall take them in the Zodiacal order. Of Gad (Aries), Jacob says, \"Gad, a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.\" Moses says, \"Blessed be he that enlargerh Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head, and he provideth the first part for himself because there, in a portion of the law-giver, was he sealed; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgements with Israel.\" The armorial bearings of Gad are, white, a troop of cavalry. All this coincides well with the martial and dominant nature of Aries, the only one of the twelve signs in which the superior planets alone bear sway, for ir is the House of Mars, exaltation of Sun and triplicity of Sun and Jupiter. The sym- bolism of the Lion is also proper to Aries on account of its solar, fiery and martial nature. Of Ephraim and Manasseh (Taurus and Gemini), classed together under their father's name, Jacob says, \"Joseph is a fruit- ful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall; the archers have surely grieved him and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel): Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts and of the womb: the blessings of thy father have pre- vailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brethren.\" Moses says, \"Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of the lasting hills. And for the precious things of the earth, and the fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwells in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top ofthe head of him that was separate from his brethren.

Those of Manesseh are flesh-colour, a Vine by a WalL All this refers to the natures of Taurus and Gemini, the firstling of the bullock and the earthy nature of the sign, shown by the hills, to Taurus while the archers over Manasseh, as Sagittarius, the sign of the Archer, is in opposition to Gemini. Of lssachar, Cancer, Jacob says-\"Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: and he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant, and he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under tribute.\" Moses says-\"Rejoice lssachar, in thy tents ... and they shall suck of the abundance of the seas.\" The armorial bearings of lssachar are-Blue, and an ass crouching beneath its burden. This coincides with the peaceful nature of the quiet and watery sign of Cancer. Of Judah, Leo, Jacob says, \"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up; he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall nor depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\" Moses says, \"This is the blessing of Judah, and he said, Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people, let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies.\" The armorial bearings of Judah are-Scarlet, a lion rampant. All this well agrees with the regal and leonine nature of the Sign. \"Bind- ing the ass's colt unto the choice vine\" may allude to the ass of Issachar, Cancer, lying between Judah, Leo, and the vine of Manasseh, Gemini. Of Naphtali, Scorpio, Jacob says, \"Naphtali is a hind let loose, he giveth goodly words.\" Moses says, \"0 Naphtali satis- fied with favour, and full with the blessings of the Lord, possess thou the West and the South.\" The armorial bearings of Naphtali are-Blue, a hind. Of Asher, Libra, Jacob says, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\" Moses says, \"Let Asher be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his 177"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"178 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that l-iterh the horse's heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. I have waited for thy salvation, () Lord.\" Moses says, \"Dan is a lion's whelp, he shall leap from Bashan.\" The armorial benrings of Dan are Green, an Eagle. These things fit with the martial and fierce nature of this sign, in which Mars principally bears sway. To the sign of Scorpio, the Egyptians attributed the Serpent, and also Typhon, the Slayer of Osiris, and on this account they call it the \"Accursed Sign.\" In good symbolism It is generally represented by the Eagle. The; horse's heeL; which I he Serpent hires are found in the Centaur figure of Sagittarius which follows Scorpio in the ZodIac. Of Benjamin, Sagitranus, Jacob says, \"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\" Moses says-\"The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.\" The armorial bearings of Benjamin me-Green, a Wolf. These suit the character of Sagittarim, portly keen, partly uf the nature of Jupiter, and partly brutal. Of Zebulon, Capricurn, Jacoh says-\"!.ebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea, and he shall be for a haven of ships, ond his border shall be unto Sidon.\" Moses says, \"Rejoice Zebulon in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents, they shall call the people unro the mountain, there the v shall offer sacri- fices of righteousness, for they shall suck of the abundance of the sea, of the treasures hid in the sands.\" This suits well the tropical, earthy and water signs of Capricorn ond Cancer. The armona I beanngs of Zebulon are- Purple, a Ship. Of Reuben, Aquanus, jacob says-\"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of puwer.

Of Simeon and Levi, Pisces, Jacob says-\"Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelry are in their habitations. 0 my soul, come not thou into their secrer, unto their assembly, mine honour, be nor thou unired: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\" This alludes to their smiting Shalom, the city of Hamor and Shechem, and slaying the latter because they had carried off Dinah, the daughter of Leah. Moses says of them-\"Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy Holy One, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; who said unto his farher and his mother, I have not seen him; neither does he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his children; for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. They shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law: and they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. Bless, Lord, his sub- stance, and accept the works of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.\" The armorial bearings of Simeon are Yellow, a Sword. These are the blessings of the twelve tribes of Israel, whose names were engraven upon the rwelve stones of the High Priest's breastplate, upon which, according to some traditions, certain flashes of light appeared playing over certain of the let- ters, and thus returning the answer of the Deity to the consul- ter of the Oracle by Urim. By comparing these blessings with the nature of the Signs attributed to the particular tribes, we have been thus enabled to trace more or less clearly the connection between them, and also the derivation of the armorial bearings ascribed to them in Royal Arch Freemasonry.

Though out of print today, it still has as much value as when it was first published. The literal Qabalah is referred to in several places, and therefore a knowledge of its leading principles is nec- essary. It is divided into three parts: GMTRIA, Gematria; NVTRIQVN, Notariqon; and ThMVRH, Temura. I originally found this paper among study lectures for the 4= 7 grade at Whare Ra. GEMATRIA was a mode of interpretation by which a name or word having a certain numerical value was deemed to have a relation with some other words having the same num- ber; thus certain numbers became representative of several ideas, and were considered to be interpretative one of the other. For example, Messiah spelled MShICh, numbered 358 and so does the phrase lEA ShILH, Shiloh shall come; and so this passage in Genesis 49 v.IO, was considered be a prophecy of the Messiah: note that Nachash NChSh, the Serpent of Moses, is also 358. The letter Shin, Sh, 300, became an emblem of divinity by corresponding with Ruach Elohim, RUCh ALHIM, the Spirit of the Living God. 181"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"182 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn NOTARICON, or abbreviation, is of two forms, one word is formed from the initial and final letters of one or more words, or the letters of one name are taken as the initials or finals of the words of a sentence. For example, in Deut. 30 v. 12, Moses asks \"Who shall go up for us to Heaven?\" The initial letters of the original words MI IOLH LNV HShMILH, form the word MILH, mylah, which means circumcision, and the final letters are IHVH, the name Jehovah: hence it was suggested that cir- cumcision was a feature of the way to God in heaven. Amen, AMN, is from the initials of Adonai melekh namen. \"The Lord and the faithful king\"; and the famous Rab- binic word of power used for talismans, AGLA, is formed of the initials of the words \"Ateh gibur leolarn Adonai.\" \"The lord ever powerful,\" or \"Tu patens in soeculum Dornme,\" TEMURA is a more complex procedure, and has led to an immense variety of curious modes of divination: the letters of a word are transposed according to certain rules with many limitations: or again, the letters as arranged by a definite scheme, often shown in a diagram. For example, a common form was to write one-half of the alphabet over the other in reverse order, and so that the first letter A was placed by the last T, and B by Shin, and so on. On this plan the word Shes- nak of Jeremiah 12 v. 26, is said to mean babel: this permuta- tion was known as ATBSh. On this principle we find twenty-one other possible forms named in order ALb at, Abgat: the complete set was called \"The combination of Tziruph.\" Other forms were rational, right, averse and irregu- lar, obtained from a square of 22 spaces in each direction, that is of 404 secondary squares, and then putting a letter in each square in order up and down, and then reading across or diag- onally, etc. Of this type is the so-called \"Kabbalah of the Nine Chambers\" of the Mark Masons. 300 30 3 200 20 2 100 10 1 000 00 a 000 00 a 000 00 a Sh L G R K B Q I A ------ - ...... - ---- -- -- ---,----- - 600 60 6 500 50 5 400 40 4 000 00 a 000 00 a 000 00 0 M(f) S V K(f) N H Th M D 900 90 9 800 80 8 700 70 7 000 00 a 000 00 0 000 00 0 Tz(f) Tz T P(f) P Ch N(f) 0 Z"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Literal Kabbalah A further development of the numerical arts was shown by the modes of Contraction and ·Extension; thus Jehovah, IHVH 26, was extended to IVD-HA-W-HA and so 10,5,6,5 or 26 became 20, 6, 12, 6, or 44. By extension Zain, z. 7, became 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 or 28; or 28 was regarded as 2 and 8 or 10. The Tetragrammaton, Jehovah 26 was also at times regarded as 2 and 6 or 8: so El Shaddai, God Almighty. AI ShDI, 1,30,300,4, 10, was 345 then 12 then 3, a trinity. A quaint conceit was that of the change of spelling of the names of Abraham and Sara: at first Abram ABRM and Sari ShRl, became ABRHM and ShRH: they were 100 and 90 years old and were sterile: now H, Heh, was deemed of a fertile type, and so the letter H was added to ABRAM, and the Yod I, con- verted into an H of the name SARAI. A MODERN APPROACH TO THE KABBALAH 183 Without doubt today the modem leaning toward the Kabbalah is through psychology and adopting what I prefer to call the \"Inner Space Syndrome.\" Not that it is wrong to look at the Kabbalah from the view- point of different levels of consciousness or states of awareness, but, gen- erally speaking, those that prefer this way tend to ignore the original approach of the religious devotee who tries to know his God through this method. An ideal situation would be to take the traditional approach of Rabbi Kaplan and marry it with that of Zev ben Halevi, if this could be done. As a hermericist, if there is such a word, I prefer to use both aspects when and where I need them, and this generally is where the Western Kabbalist seems to be heading. As we have seen in this volume, the Golden Dawn goes yet a step further by using the Kabbalah in magical ritual, which some of the old Jewish sects possibly did but in a much dif- ferent manner. There is an old saying that \"there is nothing new under the sun.\" Writers such as Edward Hoffman 18 1 have well and truly pointed this fact out to us, for many of the old mystical ways resemble Indian Tantric techniques and modern magical practices adopted by modern occultists, such as Kenneth Grant and his Typhonian OTO. 181 See Way of SpIeJUioT."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"184 The Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn AU of these are, of course, tailored to fit the requirements of the par- ticular individual or sect. The Kabbalah is an extremely versatile concept to familiarize oneself with, providing the dogma of the school we study under is considered as a guideline only, and the Higher Self IS given free rein to explore other dimensions using a Kabbalistic framework. Though 1 have tried to present the Golden Dawn viewpoint (which is of course as subjective as its practitioners), this too is changing, with modern studies of the Kabbalah being introduced today. Writets such as Regardie and Halevi have both added extra dimensions to the Kabbalah that cannot be ignored. The Golden Dawn will continue to grow and expand on its teachings, as the Kabbalistic viewpoint of 100 years ago is not necessarily what is taken today or even 100 years from now. It is rather surprising to note how many of those who study the Golden Dawn tradition feel that the viewpoint of the Order goes only as far as the Rituals, the Knowledge Lectures, and the Flying Rolls,182 then stops. At Whare Ra Temple in New Zealand there were literally stacks of lectures on the Kabbalah that were given out in Temple over a 60-year period; many of them have never been published. A number of these, mainly being Zoharic quotes, have been included in this book, but unfor- tunately there were a number destroyed. Many of these same documents were also given out in Golden Dawn lectures as early as the early. 1890s by various Golden Dawn temples, while a number were added later. While visiting Los Angeles in 1988, [ was pleasantly surprised to find yet further dimensions of the Kabbalah given in a series of lectures by the Chief of the Los Angeles Golden Dawn Temple, Laura Jennings- Yorke, who presented the day-to-day aspects of the Kabbalah in a refresh- ingly clear and concise manner and in a style of her own which, no doubt, was well suited to the American temperament. It is new ground like this that brings the teachings of the Kabbalah to the masses in a more readily acceptable form than either the Traditionalist or the Psychological view- point. Both the teachings of Dion Fortune and Paul Foster Case, though written in the first half of this century, also bear out this fact. Kabbalistic doctrine, no matter which school one studies, is a con- tinually evolving process that should be kept abreast of 20th- and Zl st- century developments and must not be left solely to 13th-century 132 Sec Astral Projection, Ritual Magic and Alchemy, edited by Francis King."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Literal Kabbalah 185 rhetoric; though, by the same token, it should not be solely ignored either.

They were used at Whare Ra Temple in New Zealand and had no associated documentation with them as to their origin. Some years ago I was sent a copy of a set of seals in the handwrit- ing of Mathers, which were almost identical to the ones here save the cir- cular border. The Mathers paper had the notation \"By the Great Magician Blaise Viginaire - A.R. 2494.\" There were three ways to use these seals. The first was to use them on talismans for additional potency. The second was for evocation work where the angel of the seal is summoned to perform a desired task. The third method was to scry the sigils for astral work in experiencing these potencies to see their full potential. Myoid mentor from Whare Ra, Jack Taylor, informed me that there was a small paper on these seals, written by Mathers, but he had only seen the original copy back in the 1930s. The three methods of study of them that I have advocated above were the basis of that paper, and Taylor simply made some condensed notes on it during a lecture at Whare Ra. 183 Also see the Goetia, one of the parts of the Lesser Key of Solomon (which is included in many publications to-date, including Waite and Crowley) for what can be called the mirror image of these angels along with associated seals.
