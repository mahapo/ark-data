Section One. Yah, Jehovah of hosts, the living Elohim, King o f the Universe, Omnipotent, All-King and Merciful, Supreme and Extolled, Who is Eternal, Sublime and M ost-Holy, formed and created the Universe in thirty - two mysterious paths of wisdom by three Sepharim, n amely: Sfor, Sippur and Sapher {Samekh-Peh-Resh, Samekh-Peh-Vau-Resh and Samekh-Peh-Resh: These ange lic names mean: Numbers, Letters and Words} which are in Him one and the same. They consist of ten Sephiroth out of nothing and of twenty-two fundamental letters. He divided the twenty-two con sonants into three divisions: Three Mothers, fundamental letters or first elements; Seven Double ; and Twelve Simple consonants.  Section Two. The ten Sephiroth out of nothing is analogous to that of the ten fingers {and toes} of the human bod y, five parallel to five, and in the center of which is the covenant with the only One {between the hands this is the tongue. Between the feet this is the circumcised p enis or the broken hymen} by the word of the tongu e and the rite of Abraham.  Section Three. Ten are the Sephiroth {often translated as \"numb ers\", this word has no English true equivalent} out of nothing, and not the number nine, ten and not eleve n. Comprehend this great wisdom, understand {Chokmah and Binah in the text} this knowledge, inq uire into it and ponder on it, render it evident an d lead the Creator back to His throne again {In other word s, descend the Tree of Life to learn Ma'aseh Berish it and ascend it to accomplish the goal of Ma'aseh Mer kabah.}  Section Four. The Ten Sephiroth out of nothing are infinite in ten ways: The beginning infinite {Kether}; The en d infinite {Chokmah}; The good infinite {Binah}; The evil infinite {Chesed}; The height infinite {Gebura h}; The depth infinite {Tiphireth}; The East infinite { Netzach}; The West infinite {Hod}; The North infini te {Yesod}; The South infinite {Malkuth} - {These last four are given in a different order in some versio ns.}, and the only Lord God, the faithful King, rules ove r all from His holy habitation for ever and ever.  Section Five. The appearance of the Sephiroth out of nothing i s like a flash of lightning, being without end, His word is in them, when they go and return; they run by His o rder like a whirlwind and humble themselves before His throne {The divine names of the lightning bolt are: Eheieh, Yah, Yahweh Elohim, El, Elohim Gibor, Jehovah Eloh Va-Da'at, Jehovah Tzabaoth, Elohim Tza baoth, Shadi El Chi, Adoni Melekh Ha-Aretz.}  Section Six. The Sephiroth out of nothing has its end linked to its beginning and its beginning linked to its en d, just as the flame is wedded to the live coal; because the L ord is one and there is not a second one, and befor e one what will you count {\"count\" has the suggestion mea ning of \"consider a Sephira.\"}?  Section Seven. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Concerning the number ten of the Sephiroth out o f nothing, keep your tongue from speaking and your mind from pondering it and if your mouth urges you to speak and your heart to think about it, return { from questioning the number ten of them}! as it reads: \" And the living creatures ran and returned,\" {Ezekie l: I, 14} and upon this {Mystery} was the covenant made.  Section Eight. These are the ten Sephiroth out of nothing: One; The Spirit of the living God {Ruach Elohim Chi im}, praised and glorified be the name {schem} of Him who lives to all eternity. The articulate word of creative power, the spirit and the word are wha t we call the holy spirit. Two; Air emanated from the spirit by which He forme d and established twenty-two consonants fundamentally. Three of them are truly fundamental letters, or mothers, seven are double and twelve a re simple consonants; hence the spirit is the first on e. Three; Primitive water emanated from the air. He f ormed and established by it Bohu {the more substant ial part of Chaos, or the waters below the upper waters of Genesis} mud and loam, made them like a bed, pu t them up like a wall, and surrounded them as with a rampart, put coldness upon them and they became dus t, as it reads; \"He says to the coldness {snow} be tho u earth.\" {Job: XXXVI; 6} Four; Fire or Aether emanated from the water. He e stablished by it the throne of glory, the Seraphim and Opanim, the holy living creatures and the angels, a nd of these three He formed His habitation, as it r eads \"Who made His angels spirits, His ministers a flami ng fire.\" {Psalm CIV, 4} He selected three consona nts from the simple ones which are in the hidden secret of three mothers or first elements: Aleph -- Air, Mem -- Water, and Shin -- Aether or Fire. He sealed them with spirit and fastened them to His great name {Sc hem, which can be spelled Shin-Aleph-Memfinal} and seale d with it six dimensions. Five; He sealed the height and turned towards above . The seal was Yod-Heh-Vau {through Aleph} Six; He sealed the depth, and turned toward below. The seal was Heh-Yod-Vau {through Aleph} Seven; He sealed the East and turned forward. The seal was Vau-Yod-Heh {through Mem} Eight; He sealed the West and turned backward. The seal was Vau-Heh-Yod {through Mem} Nine; He sealed the {North} and turned to the {left }. The seal was Heh-Vau-Yod {through Shin} Ten; He sealed the {South} and turned to the {right }. The seal was Yod-Vau-Heh {through Shin} {Extended note: The letters of the six seals are in different order in different versions of the manus cripts. There is also confusion about the order of South an d North, right and left. The latter problem may de pend on the divinity having right and left sides opposit e to the human right and left. The former problem follows from the latter. Also, the oral tradition that asc ribes the passage of the seals through the three Mo ther letters depends on numbers 2 through 4 of this sect ion.}  Section Nine. These are the ten spheres of existence out of no thing. From the spirit of the living God emanated air, from the air, water, from the water, fire or aether , from the aether, the height and the depth, the Ea st and the West, the North and the South. {Extended Note: Thi s is not a simple system of a single emanation. Th e Hindu theory of the three Gunas is closer to this t han the Neoplatonic theory. Here we have a primary emanation from the three abstract qualities of numb ers, letters and words (Sec. 1). The ten sephiroth are emanated in more than three spatial dimensions and interact with the letters via a complex relationshi p to the three Mother letters. Even the relationship of the three Mother letters to the other letters and to the ten"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"sephiroth is not simple but compound. The higher f orm of the Mothers has the sequence Aleph then Mem then Shin. From Shin this sequence replicates in a lower form. As we will see in the next chapter, t hese three Mother letters then take a different order to produce yet a still lower form of the Tree of the Ten Sephiroth. The turning point is described in secti on eight through permutation of the letters of the name Yah -- as foretold in the first section of this cha pter. The order of the three Mother letters given in this chapter is that of the \"Cube of Space\". The order of these Mother letters given in the next chapter d efines a different kind of universe, that of the \"Schem\" or G.'. D.'. Tree of Life. These two universes (and o thers hinted at in this first chapter) are considered to be \"one above the other\" in the sense of abstractio n being above the concrete.}  Chapter Two.  Section One. There are twenty-two letters fundamentally. Thr ee of them are the first elements, true fundamental s or mothers, seven are double and twelve are simple con sonants. The three fundamental letters Aleph-Mem- Shin have as their basis the balance. In one scale is the merit and in the other the fault, which are placed in equilibrium by the tongue {This is shown in the Egy ptian Book of the Dead as the Weighing of the Soul of the Dead and the Testing of the Balance by Thoth, t he god of letters}. The three fundamental letters, Aleph, Mem, Shin, signify, as Mem is mute like the water and Shin hissing like the fire, there is Alep h among them, a breath of air which reconciles them. {The sounds of these three letters resemble the characteristic sounds of their elements: Mem is lik e the rolling of waves, Shin is Like the hissing of flames and Aleph is like the blowing of the wind.}  Section Two. These are the twenty-two letters which form the foundation {Yod-Samekh-Vau-Dalet, the name later applied to the ninth Sephira, is the word used here in the text.}, after having been appointed and established. He combined, weighed {assigned values } and exchanged them, and formed by them all beings which are in existence, and all these which will be formed in all time to come.  Section Three. He established twenty-two letters fundamentally by the voice, formed by the breath of air and fixed them on five places in the human mouth, namely: One at t he throat {guttural sounds}, Aleph, Hay, Chet, Ayin . Two at the palate {palatal sounds}, Gimel, Yod, Kaf , Qof. Three, at the tongue {lingual sounds}, Dale t, Tet, Lamed, Nun, Taw. Four, at the teeth {dental s ounds}, Zain, Shin, Samekh, Resh, Tzaddi. Five, at the lips {labial sounds}, Bet, Vau, Mem, Peh.  Section Four. He fixed the twenty-two Letters of foundation on the sphere like a wall with 231 gates, and turned the spheres forward and backward. For an illustration may serve the three letters, Gemel, Nun, Ayin. The re is nothing better than joy {spelled Ayin-Nun-Gemel in Hebrew} and nothing worse than sorrow or plague {spelled Nun-Gemel-Ayin, in Hebrew. Thus various c ombinations of the same letters in this language ca n produce opposite meanings. This is a part of the m ysticism of the letters, and also a part of the nat ure of Hebrew root word formations} {Here is one traditional way of presenting the 231: AB AG AD AH AV AZ ACh AT AY AK AL AM AN AS Aa'a AP ATz AQ AR ASh ATh BG BD BH BV BZ BCh BT BY BK BL BM BN BS Ba'a BP BTz BQ BR BSh BTh GD GH GV GZ GCh GT GY GK GL GM GN GS Ga'a GP GTz GQ GR GSh GTh DH DV DZ DCh DT DY DK DL DM DN DS Da'a DP DTz DQ DR DSh DTh HV HZ HCh HT HY HK HL HM HN HS Ha'a HP HTz HQ HR HSh HTh"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" VZ VCh VT VY VK VL VM VN VS Va'a VP VTz VQ VR VSh VTh ZCh ZT ZY ZK ZL ZM ZN ZS Za'a ZP ZTz ZQ ZR ZSh ZTh ChT ChY ChK ChL ChM ChN ChS Cha'a ChP ChTz ChQ ChR ChSh ChTh  TY TK TL TM TN TS Ta'a TP TTz TQ TR TSh TTh  YK YL YM YN YS Ya'a YP YTz YQ YR YSh YTh  KL KM KN KS Ka'a KP KTz KQ KR KSh KTh  LM LN LS La'a LP LTz LQ LR LSh LTh  MN MS Ma'a MP MTz MQ MR MSh MTh  NS Na'a NP NTz NQ NR NSh NTh  Sa'a SP STz SQ SR SSh STh  a'aP a'aTz a'aQ a'aR a'aSh a'aTh   PTz PQ PR PSh PTh   TzQ TzR TzSh TzTh   QR QSh QTh   RSh RTh   ShTh    }  Section Five. But how was it done? He combined, weighed and e xchanged: the Aleph with all the other letters in succession, and all the others again with Aleph; Be t with all, and all again with Bet; and so the whol e series of Letters {was paired off in very possible way}. Hence it follows that there are 231 formations, and that every creature and every word emanated from one nam e. {Extended Note: There are only 231 ways to combine the 22 Hebrew letters into different pairs. The one name is Schem, composed of the three Moth er letters Shin, Aleph, and Mem, which provide the bas is for all sounds. Schem is the Hebrew word for \"Name\" especially \"Name of the divinity.\" Schem is usually spelled Shin-Mem, but Aleph can be added t o the middle of the word without making a difference in its pronunciation.}  Section Six. He created a reality out of nothing, called the non-existing into existence and shaped colossal pil lars from intangible air. This has been shown by the example of combining the letter Aleph with all the other l etters, and all the other letters with Aleph. {Of the thre e Mother Letters, Aleph is the most basic. It's nu mber value is One; and Aleph is the breath of sound carr ying air that is necessary to pronounce any and all of the other letters. Thus, the gates of Aleph, the combi nations formed between Aleph and all the remaining 21 letters produce the actual sounds of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. The pairs or gates with Alep h ARE the spoken Hebrew letters.} He predetermined, and by speaking created every creature and every word b y one name. For a sign of this may serve the twenty- two elementary substances {Alphabet letters} by the primitive substance of Aleph.  Chapter Three.  Section One. The three first elements, Aleph Mem Shin, are ty pified by a balance, in one scale the merit and in the other the fault, which are placed in equilibrium by the tongue. These three mothers, Aleph Mem Shin, are a great, wonderful and unknown mystery, and are seale d by six rings, or elementary circles, namely: air, water, and fire emanated from them, which gave birt h again to some offspring {These rings are the ways of ordering three letters, as: Aleph-Mem-Shin, male; S hin-Mem-Aleph, female; Shin-Aleph-Mem, male; Mem-Aleph-Shin, female; Mem-Shin-Aleph, male; Aleph -Shin-Mem, female}  Section Two. God appointed and established the three mothers; combined, weighed and exchanged them, and formed by them three mothers Mem Aleph Shin in the world { the six directions: Above, East and South are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"probably Male in this tradition. Below, West and N orth are probably Female in this tradition -- this is the key to the seals of the directions.}, in the year { The six warm months are female two by two while the six cold months are male two by two} and in man, male a nd female {Here the first rings apply to childhood, the third and fourth to adulthood and the last ring s to age}.  Section Three. The three mothers Aleph-Mem-Shin in the world ar e: air, water and fire. Heaven was created from fi re or ether {\"heaven\" or \"schemim\" starts with the letter Shin in Hebrew}; the earth {comprising sea above l and -- \"Mem\" is both the name of Mem and the Hebrew wor d for sea} from the elementary water; and the atmospheric air from the elementary air, or spirit, which establishes the balance among them.  Section Four. The three mothers Aleph-Mem-Shin produce in the y ear heat, coldness and moistness. Heat was created from fire, coldness from water, and moistness from air which equalizes them {fire + water = steam or m oist air: Shin + Mem = Aleph, in this particular mystica l sense}. { 1 3 / 2 \\ / / \\ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 5\\ /4 \\ / \\ 6 / / \\ 8/ \\ 7 9 | / ÄÄÄ \\ |10 | ÄÄÄÄÄ }  Section Five. The three mothers Aleph-Mem-Shin produce in man, male and female, breast, body and head. The head was created from fire {Shin, on the Tree of Life. The upper three Sephiroth are the three prongs of t he letter Shin, while the base of the letter forms the Abyss, Aleph-Bet-Dalet-Heh.}, the (belly) from wat er {Mem, on the Tree of Life. The upper stroke of thi s letter is the Sephira Yesod -- which is spelled w ith Yod as its first letter in Hebrew -- and the body o f this letter Mem is the Sephira Malkuth -- the Heb rew word \"Malkuth\" starts with the letter \"Mem\". In ot her words, Mem forms the two lowest Sephiroth.}, an d the (breast in man, male and female {Aleph, on the Tree of Life forms the middle five Sephiroth by its upper two points, its lower two points and the inte rsection in the middle of the letter Aleph}) --> (N ote: The text of Section Five is corrupt.

He let the letter Mem predomin ate in primitive water, and crowned it, combined on e with the other {made Mem the top letter of the colu mn of Mercy on the right side of the Tree of Life. The order of the three letters is Mem, Shin and Aleph i n the Sephiroth Chokmah, Chesed and Netzach {a male ring} going down, and the opposite order {female ri ng going up.

Third Division. He let the letter Shin predomin ate in primitive fire, crowned it, combined one wit h the other {made Shin the top of the column of severity on the Tree of Life. The order of these three lett ers is Shin, Aleph, Mem in the Sephiroth Binah, Geburah an d Hod going down (Male ring) and Mem, Aleph, Shin going up (Female ring). This makes the pillar of Severity, the left column of the Tree of Life, Male when viewed from the top and Female when viewed fro m the bottom. By the method of placing Tetragrammaton on the Tree of Life this column is c onsidered predominantly Female}, and formed by them, heaven in the world, heat in the year, and th e head of male and female {As a Hebrew word, the na me of the letter Shin means \"tooth\"; and of course the teeth are to be found in the head}.  Chapter Four.  Section One. The seven double letters, Bet Gemel Dalet Koph P eh Resh Taw with a duplicity of pronunciation, aspirated {with a strong outward breath} and unaspi rated {without a strong outward breath. These two modes of pronunciation are represented by the prese nce or absence of a dot in some forms of written an d printed Hebrew, the dot or point being called Dagas h and placed in the center of the letter} serve as a model of softness and hardness, strength and weakne ss {At the time of the writing of the \"Sepher Yetzi rah\" these seven letters were pronounced each in two way s: with outrush of air or with inward sound. They are models for opposite qualities and for the seven pla nets with their benign and malignant effects. Mode rn scholars differ as to which of the Hebrew letters o riginally had this double quality of pronunciation, Mordell holds that a form of Hebrew much older than the writing of the \"Yetzirah\" had a different usag e of this double pronunciation. He has accordingly atte mpted to reconstruct a \"more ancient\" version of th e \"Yetzirh\" {See Bibliography}. Modern Hebrew dialec ts retain a few of these double pronunciations and add new ones.}  Section Two. Seven double letters, Bet Gemel Dalet Koph Peh R esh Taw shall, as it were symbolize Life, Peace, Wisdom, Wealth, Beauty, Fruitfulness and Dominion { Note: this is the list according to the researches of the G.'. D.'.. The qualities are those listed in t he \"Sepher Yetzirah\", but the order of the list is different. The same is true for associations to the seven plan ets -- for a comparison of the several orderings fo r these seven Double Letters which are to be found in the d ifferent versions of the \"Yetzirah\", see the Stenri ng translation noted in the Bibliography}.  Section Three. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Seven double letters serve to signify the antith esis to which human life is exposed. The antithesi s of Life is Death; of Peace, Strife or War; of Wisdom, Folly ; of Wealth, Poverty; of Beauty, Ugliness; of Fruitfulness, Sterility or Childlessness; and of Do minion, Dependence or Slavery.  Section Four. The seven double consonants are analogous to the six dimensions: height and depth {Bet for Above, Gemel for Below}, East and West {Dalet for East, Ko ph for West}, North and South {Peh for North, Resh for South} and the holy temple that stands in the c enter {Taw}, which carries them all.  Section Five. The double consonants are seven, Bet Gemel Dalet Koph Peh Resh Taw and not six, they are seven and not eight; reflect upon this fact, inquire about it , and make it so evident, that the Creator be ackno wledged to be on His throne again {Although this particular statement is often taken as a slap against the speculations of the Gnostics, who were very much at the peak of their activity at the time in which th e \"Sepher Yetzirah\" was written, there are other mean ings. If the seven double letters are assigned to the lower seven Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, this may be an injunction to study the fifty gates of understanding; which are the meditations of each of the lower Sephiroth taken as containing divisions corresponding to all the lower seven Sephiroth -- s even times seven or forty-nine plus one, the fiftie th, to refer to the throne of the three higher Sephiroth. Alternately, this may be an injunction to meditate on the spatial or other configurations of these letters as a means of attaining a vision of the letter Taw as the throne of the Creator.}.  Section Six. The seven double consonants, fundamentally, havi ng been designed and established, combined, weighed , and changed by God, He formed by them: seven planet s in the world, seven days in the year, seven gates , openings of the senses, in man male and female.  Section Seven. The seven planets in the world are: Saturn {Taw} , Jupiter {Koph}, Mars {Peh}, Sun {Resh}, Venus {Dalet}, Mercury {Bet}, Moon {Gemel}. Seven days i n the year are the seven days of the week {Sunday, Resh; Monday Gemel; Tuesday, Peh; Wednesday, Bet; T hursday, Koph; Friday, Dalet; and Saturday, Taw}; seven gates in man, male and female are: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and the mouth {These applications of the planets to the double letters a re the most highly corrupted matter in existing man uscripts of the \"Sepher Yetzirah\", as is noted further below . No definitive text exists in this matter. The a ttribution to the seven gates in man, male and female might be as follows: right eye, Bet; left eye, Gemel; right nostril, Peh; left nostril, Resh; right ear, Dalet; left ear, Koph; mouth, Taw. Although this seems reasonable, no certainty is claimed; the allocation suggested here to the human gates is merely plausi ble. The allocation to the planets is that used by the G .'.

The twelve simple consonants HB:Heh, Vau, Zain, Chet, Tet, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi & Qof symbolize also twelve oblique points {The Ord er of the Golden Dawn says, in order: North East, HB:Heh ; South East, HB:Vau ; East Above, HB:Zain ; East Below, HB:Chet ; North Above, HB:Tet ; North Below, HB:Yod ; North West, HB:Lamed ; South West, HB:Nun ; West Above, HB:Samekh ; West Below, HB:Ayin ; South Above, HB:Tzaddi ; and South Below, HB:Qof. The Kalish translation gives in the same order for the letters: East Height, North East, East Depth, South Height, South East, South D epth, West Height, South West, West Depth, North Height, North West, North Depth.}. They grew wider and wider to all eternity, and these are the boundaries of the world. {In the Golden Dawn theory, as deve loped by Paul Foster Case, the posthumous founder of B.O. T.A., these 12 directions are the locations of the twelve edges of the \"Cube of Space\" which has for f aces the first six double letters. Some Qabalistic studies attempt to define a diamond shape in three dimensions. In any event, this section is possibly the origin of the Masonic Temple of Solomon, which fill s the universe through its duplication -- like thre e- dimensional tiles fitting together.)  Section Three. The twelve simple letters HB:Heh, Vau, Zain, Che t, Tet, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi & Qof fundamentally, having been designed, established, c ombined, weighed and exchanged by Him, He performed by them: twelve constellations in the wor ld, twelve months in the year, and twelve organs in the human body, male and female.  Section Four. The twelve constellations in the world are: Arie s, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorp io, Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius and Pisces. The twe lve {Hebrew} months of the year are: Nisan {the seventh month}, Ivar, Sivan, Tamus, Ab, Elul, Tishr i, Mavcheshvan {also called Chesvan} Kislev, Tebet, Shebat and Adar. The twelve organs of the human bo dy are: two hands two feet, two kidneys, gall, smal l intestines, liver, esophagus, stomach and milt (eit her the spleen or reproductive organs. Both system s have been often confused in Theosophical writings and an cient sources. The degree of absurdity involved in this"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"relationship is incredible.

He made them as a conflict, drew them up like a wall; and set one against the other as in warfare. {This last point is explained by the observation that the se twelve letters symbolize processes in human beha vior that can interfere with each other. Some further p oints must now be made regarding the assignments of qualities and body parts to these twelve simple let ters. In the Golden Dawn Tradition, many things are subordinated to the Astrological symbolism. This w as true in the case of the Double letters, where on e of several natural methods of assignment in the \"Yetzi rah\" was passed over to provide a better match betw een the Double Letters and the planets to work with Tar ot Trumps. The other methods do not work as well with the G.'. D.'. Tarot-Astrological system, and t hey are therefore excluded from \"Liber 777\". This should not make the student think that the primary method used there excludes the several systems proposed he re. It is best to begin with a simple system. The seri ous student then must examine the other systems to determine the information contained in each of them . In the case of these Twelve Simple Letters, this is even more the case. The Golden Dawn -- \"Liber 777\" system has shifted the twelve qualities of the sim ple letters to make them match the usual qualities of t he Astrological signs. The \"Yetzirah\" has set up a n entirely new parallel system through these qualitie s which deserves its own study. The same is true o f the body organs mentioned here. In the Golden Dawn sys tem, these associations are omitted entirely. The usual associations to the Zodiac signs are assumed in place of these associations in the \"Yetzirah\" to body organs. It is suggested that these associations ha ve a particular meaning of their own, and that the serious student will in time find it useful to study that s ystem. By all means, begin with the simpler approa ch given in \"Liber 777\" and in the various works derived fro m the Order of the Golden Dawn. When comfortable with that approach, consider these other systems. It is the work of the advanced student of the myste ries to make these apparently diverse systems function well together -- even if the war of the simple letters is the only manner in which it may be done. Always remember that the ideas presented in the \"Yetzirah\" are like words in their effect. The obj ect is to first learn the simple uses of these ideas, and then to discover the uses of these ideas that are l ike circumlocutions, figures of speech and allegories. By that means, one can obtain the conversation of the Angels.}  Chapter Six.  Section One. These are the three mothers or the first element s Aleph, Mem, and Shin, from which emanated three progenitors: primitive air, water and fire, and fro m which emanated as their offspring three progenito rs and their offspring, namely: the seven planets and thei r hosts, and the twelve oblique points. {The produ ction of the double and single letters from the mother le tters is like the interaction of the mother letters in the six rings: Example; Beth is like Aleph combined with Sh in, HB:Gemel = HB:Aleph + HB:Mem, HB:Dalet = HB:Shin + HB:Mem, HB:Koph = HB:Bet + HB:Lamed, HB:P eh = HB:Bet + HB:Dalet, HB:Resh = HB:Dalet + HB:Gemel, HB:Taw = HB:Aleph + HB:Shin + HB:Mem = HB:Bet + HB:Gemel + HB:Dalet = HB:Koph + HB:Peh + HB:Resh, HB:Heh = HB:Aleph + HB: Koph, HB:Vau = HB:Aleph + HB:Peh,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HB:Zain = HB:Aleph + HB:Resh, HB:Chet = HB:Aleph + HB:Taw, HB:Tet = HB:Shin + HB:Koph, HB:Yod = HB:Shin + HB:Peh, HB:Lamed = HB:Shin + HB: Resh, HB:Nun + HB:Shin + HB:Taw, HB:Samekh = HB:Mem + HB:Koph, HB:Ayin = HB:Mem + HB :Peh, HB:Tzaddi = HB:Mem + HB:Resh, HB:Qof = HB:Mem + HB:Taw -- this is obtained from t he symbolic meaning of the letters and the dictionary meanings of the words they can be made t o form. It is not simply related to the sounds of t he letters or to their number values, although a compl ex relationship does exist through gematria. This theoretical example of the interrelationship of the letters is taken with permission from \"Brief Meani ngs of the Hebrew Letters\" by Bill Heidrick, copyright 197 4 e.v.}  Section Two. To confirm this there are faithful witnesses; th e world, year and man, the twelve, the Equipoise {F ire, Water and Air in balance}, the heptade {seven-fold nature of things}, which He regulates like the Drag on {Tali or the constellation Draco with its head and tail now taken in the simplified modern Astrology a s the nodes of the Moon} sphere {the Hebrew word here is Galgal. It has the meaning of \"machinery like turning wheels which drives the universe} and the h eart {besides all this argument, it feels right}.  Section Three. The first elements Aleph, Mem and Shin are air, water and fire; the fire is above, the water below, and a breath of air establishes the balance among them. For an illustration may serve, that the fire carrie s the water, is the phonetic character of HB:Mem which is mute and HB:Shin is hissing like fire, there is HB:Aleph among them, a breath of air which places t hem in equilibrium.  Section Four. Dragon {Tali} is in the world like a king upon h is throne, the sphere is in the year like a king in the empire, and the heart is in the human body like a k ing in war. {Thus the three mother letters are lik e Draco, the seven double letters are like the regula r motions of the planets and the twelve single lett ers are like the easily upset functions of the body.)  Section Five. Elohim has also set the one over against the oth er; the good against the evil, and the evil against the good {here \"good\" is the Hebrew word \"tob\" which is the seal of creation used in Genesis and \"evil\" is \"Ra\" the name used by the Egyptians for the god of the sun - - a competitor of Jehovah}; the good proceeds from the good, and the evil from the evil; the good purifies the bad, and the bad the good; the good is preserv ed for the good, and the evil for the bad ones {The Qabali stic ideas of good and evil are very different from those of modern society. Avoid a moral interpretation he re. In simple terms, \"good\" = \"our side\" and \"evil \" = \"anything against us.\" The Qabalistic ideas are mo re complex than that, and they involve concepts muc h like those met in law courts.}.  Section Six. There are three of which every one of them stand s by itself; one is in the affirmative, the other i n the negative and one equalizes them {The three mother l etters are viewed as plaintiff, defendant and judge }.  Section Seven. There are seven of which three are against three and one places them in equilibrium. There are twe lve which are all the time at war; three of them produc e love, and three hatred, three are animators and t hree destroyers {Beth vs. Gimel, Dalet vs. Koph, Peh vs. Resh with Taw placing them in equilibrium. As for the twelve which are at war, that matter depends on association to body parts and directions -- it is not clearly defined in the \"Sepher Yetzirah\", but needs more study.}.  Section Eight."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The three that produce love are the heart and th e ears; the three that produce hatred are the liver , the gall and the tongue; the three animators are the two nos trils and the milt; and the three destroyers are th e mouth and the two openings of the body; and God, the fait hful King rules over all from His holy habitation t o all eternity. He is one above three, three are above s even, seven are above twelve, and all are linked to gether. {If the text is not corrupt in Section Eight, we ma y understand that: Gimel, Peh and either Aleph, Taw or Vau produce love; Lamed, Ayin and perhaps Taw produ ce hatred; Dalet, Resh and Qof are the animators; Peh and two other Letters are the destroyers. The issue is not clear.}  Section Nine. There are twenty-two letters by which the I AM { HB:Aleph-Nun-Yod-Heh}, Yah {HB:Yod-Heh}, He of the Hosts {HB:Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh Tzaddi-Bet-Aleph-Vau -Taw}, God Almighty {HB:Aleph-Lamed Shin- Dalet-Yod}, He Who Creates the Eiohim {HB:Yod-Heh-V au-Heh Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal}, designed, formed and created by three Sepharim, His whole world, and formed by them creatures and all those that will be formed in time to come.  Section Ten. When the Patriarch Abraham comprehended the grea t truism, revolved it in his mind, conceived it perfectly, made careful investigations and profound inquiries, pondered upon it and succeeded in contemplations, the Lord of the Universe appeared t o him, called him his friend, made with him a coven ant between the ten fingers of his hands, which is the covenant of the tongue, and the covenant between th e ten toes of his feet, which is the covenant of circumci sion, and said of him: \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee.\" {Jer.l.5}  THUS ENDS HB:Samekh-Peh-Resh Yod-Tzaddi-Yod -Resh-Heh  -oOo-  Bibliography Copies and translations of the \"Sepher Yetzirah\": Kalish, Isidor; first published English translation , 1877 e.v., includes Hebrew text.
