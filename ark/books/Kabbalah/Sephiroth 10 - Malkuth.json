It is where You are now if this is the first look at the Qabalah or any other spiritual jour ney that you are ab out to undertake. From Malkuth there are 3 paths. The center path and the accepted route up the Tree of Life is to the next Sephiroth Yesod via the path called The Fool. Here a blind leap of faith is required for the seeker to begin their spiritual journey to the awareness of Yesod and the hint of rewards to come on The Tree of Life. The left path is The World and if taken will lead the seeker directly to Hod , all magickal knowledge, without first having taken the faith of Yesod into their heart. Taking this path will result in the learning but not the understanding of magickal systems. Knowledge is dangerous unless you have means to understand your actions by the use of it ! The path to the right is The Sun and although it is also represented as a Sepiroth in Tiphareth , here it is the reflection of the th at Sephiroth as a way to the power of Netzach , the love of Venus. Again having short cut up The Tree of Life and avoiding Yesod and Hod on the way, the blinding love of Netzach is like staring into the Sun. You have not taken the leap of faith to Yesod . Nor made the correct judgments to Hod or even explored the energy of The Star before arriving at Netzach . You will be blinded by love. and the next path to Tiphareth , the real source of the Sun's energy, via Temperance will be so much hard er for the seeker. If you look at my writings in Yesod I outline the accepted paths up The Tree of Life. That is not to say you cannot use any of the other paths in any combination. You have the free will to go as you decide. Some times this will be absolutely necessary to learn what you require, or accomplish what yo u have set out to achieve. Ag ain the choice is entirely yours.
