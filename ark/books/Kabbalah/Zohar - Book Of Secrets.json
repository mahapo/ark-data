A substantial Appendix follows the five core chapters. The fi rst appendix is an extensive addition from the sixteenth century which is intended to follow after the verse, “ And Elohim said the waters will swarm with movement of living-being, ” in Chapter Three. The second brief appendix is an addition intended for the very end of the fifth ch apter. The text itself mixes citations from the Torah , the Writings and the Prophets with the Zoharic commentary. To avoid confusion, the Torah quotes will be “penned” in Bold Italic , the Writings and Prophets will be just Bold , and the commentary in regular type. PREFACE The hooks and their pillars shall be made of silver . 1 Said Rabbi Yitza’aq: “I presume that the hooks of the pillars symbo lize all those who are attached to the supernal unifying pillars, And that all those who are below depend on them. What is the significance of the word Vavim ,yvv ? Six within six, all united and nourished by the Circle 2 that is set over them. And we have learned in the Sifra Detzniyutha this dictum: “The supernal Vav v and the inferior Vav v ,” All comprehended in ONE meaning and ONE Name, Having one and the same significance. Now, what is the Sifra Detzniyutha ?” Said Rabbi Shimeon: “Five chapters which are comprised in a Great Hall and fill the whole Earth. 3 ” Said Rabbi Yehudah: “If they are so comprehensive, they are better than all!” Said Rabbi Shimeon: “Verily, it is so for him who enters and comes out; And it is NOT ( al ) for him who enters the NOT ( al ) and comes out. 4 This is comparable to a person w hose dwelling was among the mountains, 5 and he (she) knew no townsfolk. He used to sow wheat and at e the wheat grains as they are. One day he entered the town. They offered him good bread. Said that person, “What is this for?” They said, “It is bread to eat.” He ate and it was singularly pleasant to his taste. He said, “And of what is this made?” They said, “Of wheat grains.” Then they offered him cakes kneaded in oil. He tasted of them. He said, “And these, of what are they made?” They said, “Of wheat grains.” Then they o ffered him pastry prepared for royalty, kneaded with honey and oil. He tasted them and said, “And these, of what are they made?” They said, “Of wheat grains.” He said, “Surel y I am the master of all of thes e, for I eat the essence of all of these, which is wheat.” And because of this disposition he knew as NOT ( al ) the delicacies of the world, and they were lost to him. It is likewise for him who seizes the general principle of wisdom 4 , and knows as NOT ( al ) all the pleasing delicacies that derive from the general principle.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Sifra Detzniyutha Chapter One We learned: The Book of THAT Which is Concealed is the book of the balancing in weight. 6 Until NOT ( al , Lo ) existed as weight, NOT existed as seeing Face to Face; 7 And the Primordial Kings 8 died, as their crowns 9 were NOT found, And the Earth was nullified, Until the Head ( sar , Rosh ) 10 desired by all desires formed and communicated the garments of splendor. 11 That weight arises from the place which is NOT Him. Those who exist as NOT are weighed in hy . 12 In His body exists the weight. NOT unites and NOT begins. In hy have they ascended, and in hy do they ascend, Who NOT are, and are, and will be. The Hidden within the Hidden 13 is formed and found in: 1) One skull, 14 2) Filled with the Dew of Bdellium, 3) An envelope of clear and concealing air, 15 4) Those that are pure wool are hanging even balanced, 16 5) The will of all wills 17 that is revealed with the prayers of those below, 6) The Open Eye 18 that does not slumber but watches c onstantly, the Eye below is by means of the Eye of the supernal radiance, 7) The openings of the hollow pillar, 19 from whence His Spirit 20 rushes forth unto all. IT created six, IT created Elohim, the heaven and the Earth . 21 Bara Shyt, IT created Six over them. 22 They are all below, And they depend on the seven of the skull as far as the splendor of all splendors.

The tail is in the head. The head goes around to the shoulders.

The Father dwells in the head, the Mother in the middle, And there is a covering from this side and from that side. And woe unto him that uncovers their nakedness. And Elohim said Lights will be in the Firmament of Heaven. 48 The male rules over the female As it is written, The Righteous is the foundation forever. 49 The Yod y illumines both, And It illumines and passes on into the Female. The Yod y sets itself apart, ascends by its level higher and higher, And the Female is darkened. And the Mother is illumined and is opened out into Her gates.

Then it will flow to draw forth from above downwards, From that irrigation of the river-bed to every level and level, (down) to the last level, In order to elicit a freewill offering from above downwards. Afterwards he needs to bind a knot in all, The bond of the intention of the faith, And all his requests shall come about-- Whether they are communal requests or individual requests. The prayer that man should request of his Master is arranged in nine ways: 1) There is according to the alphabet; and 2) There is by way of mentioning the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He e.g. compassionate, gracious, etc. 3) There is according to the precious Names of the Holy One, blessed be He, like: Ehyeh (I will be), hy , vhy , hvhy , El , Elohim , Tzuhva’oth (Host), Shadhai (Almighty), Adonai (My Master). 4) There is according to the ten Sefiroth, like: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tifareth, Gevurah, Gedulah, Binah, Hochmah, Keter. 5) There is by mentioning the righteous ones, like the Patriarchs, and the Prophets, and the Kings. 6) There is the form of songs and praises (for which there is a true tradition), and higher than these, 7) There is he who knows to prepare adornments unto his Master, in a becoming fashion. 8) There is (the prayer) with the knowledge how to ascend from below upwards. 9) There is the he who knows to elicit the abundance from above downwards.

The one conceals its goodness and its blessing in a treasure that is called “Hall.” This is indicated in the verse: And the Lord hvhy is in His holy Hall, keep silence before Him. 185 Our sages, of blessed memory, alluded to this (when stating that): “All the good of a man is in his house.” As it is said: In all my house he is faithful. 186 And it is translated: In all that is with Me. 187 And when (man) has intention in every one of the nine ways as behooves, He is the human being that honors the Master, the Holy Name. And of him it is written: For they that honor Me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 188 I will honor. In this world, to fulfill and to bring about all his needs, And all the nations of the earth will see that the name of Elohim is called upon him, and will fear him. And in the world to come he will merit to stand in the division of the pious, even though he did not study sufficiently. For he merited to mind the knowledge of his Master and had the proper intention thereto. What is: And they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed ? It refers to him that does not know to unify the Holy Name And to bind the knot of the faith And to draw forth to that place that is in need, And to honor the Name of his Master. The more so with regard to he who has no intention, Amen . Thus, whoever moves his lips with purity of heart, In the waters that purify, What is written of him?
