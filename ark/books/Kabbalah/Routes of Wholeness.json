A common link between these two traditions is the use of symbols and metaphors of wholeness, specifically the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. Chapter One introduces the sefirot of the Tree of Life as found in Judaism, Christianity, the Hermetic tradition, and the Western Esoteric Tradition. Chapter Two analyses how Carl Jung applied and utilised the sefirot , generally in rela tion to alchemy, in his work. Chapter Three defines the Western Esoteric Tradition while the fourth and fifth chapters introduce an analytical psycholog ical interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life as a way to bring analytical psychology and the Wester n Esoteric Tradition together in dialogue. Areas of investigation for these latter chapters include: the connection of the ego-complex with the material world, the polythe istic and monotheistic nature of the psyche and synchronicity and the real ms of dualistic and non-dualistic transpersonal experience. Finally, Chapter Six presents several theoretical and pragmatic applications for an analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. The summation is that both analytic al psychology and the Western Esoteric Tradition can offer each other various areas of complementation. This thesis includes four diagrams, an outline of two common rituals from the Western Esoteric Tradition and a gl ossary of non-Jungian terms."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" ii Acknowledgments There are several people whose influence, assistance, or very presence in my life was essential to the completion of this thesis.

Also, his keen insights into Jung, synchronicity and the Western Esoteric Tradition were absolutely indispensable. I would also like to thank Professor Andrew Samuel s and Dr. Karl Figlio of the Centre for Psychoanalytic Studies; their guidance and suggestions over the years were and are appreciated. For the later stages of wr iting and rewriting I am indebted to the phenomenal suggestions offered by Dr. Leon Schlamm (Kent) and Dr. Alan Cardew (Essex). Also from the Centre for Psychoana lytic Studies I would like to thank Marilyn Ward for her hard work at keeping the pr ocess running smoothly dur ing those critical early years. Finally, to all the PhD students at the Centre I say “cheers” and rest assured your impact on me during my time at Essex was not a token one. There are also several people from outside the Academy whose support was essential to the completion of this thesis.

Through this perspe ctive, the Western Esoteric Tr ee of Life can be seen as a metaphor of the process of individuation (ini tiation). The Western Esoteric Tradition’s use of the image of the Kabbalistic Tree of Li fe reflects both their world-view and the presumed stages of psycho-sp iritual transformations thought to occur within that world- view. While Jung did not write specifically on the Western Esoteric (Occult) tradition he did find that related esoteric traditions such as alchemy and various forms of mysticism paralleled what he termed the process of individuation. Ultimately, an analytical psychological interpretation reveal s that the Western Esoteric Tree of Life mirrors Jung’s notion of the individuation proces s and that with an analyti cal psychological appreciation of metaphor, the Western Esoteric Tradi tion has, consciously or unconsciously, developed an initiatory system of psychological value. Chapter One of this thesis traces the use of the sefirot , the components that comprise the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, through four spiritual traditions: Judaism, Christianity, Hermeticism, and the Western Esoteric Tradi tion. In each tradition the sefirot function as a metaphor or symbol of the middoth or qualities of an unknown or even unknowable source. However, while each tradition may have this common trait, each application of the Tree of Life is unique to the world-view of the tradition that employs the Tree."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 2 The second chapter presents an overvie w of Jung’s understanding and application of the sefirot . As Jung’s use of th e Tree of Life and the sefirot is intimately related to his understanding of alchemy a review of the ke y components of Jung’s use of this arcane art, specifically his understanding of the conjunction of opposites is also presented. Edward Edinger’s interpretation of the conjun ction is also presented to amplify Jung’s thoughts on the matter. Jung’s use of the sefirot permeates many of his most important psychological theories and is one more exampl e of his appreciation of a wide variety of spiritual traditions. Chapter Three outlines the primary compone nts of the Western Esoteric Tradition (also simply known as “Magick”) and in troduces an analytic al psychological understanding of metaphor to the definition of the Tradition. Essentially Magick in this thesis is understood as li nking art and science, through the medium of metaphor (and therefore the psyche), in connection with indi vidual volition. When the Western Esoteric Tradition’s metaphysical claims of spiritual initiation are taken to be reflections of psychological occurrences, we see that the Tradition mirrors Jung’s notion of individuation or becomi ng a whole individual. Chapter Four presents an analytical psychological interpretation of the lower seven sefirot and the Supernal Abyss of the West ern Esoteric Tree of Life. These sefirot symbolise what could be described as a dua listic relation with the components of the psyche or a personal theistic experience of the lower transper sonal realms of the Tree. Chapter Five analyses the remaining three sefirot (the Supernal Triad) and how they, especially the sefira Kether , reflect a non-dual experience of the Esoteric Tree of Life where the “I/Thou” dichotomy found in the lower sefirot is absent. This chapter also"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 3 introduces Leon Schlamm’s claim that analytical psychology can, in fact, be seen as a form of a secular, detraditionalised mysticism. Finally, Chapter Six introduces the wholly abstract source of the Western Es oteric Tree of Life as represented by the Negative Veils of Existence; the chapter concludes with a brief foray into how the analytical psychological interp retation of the Western Esoter ic Tree of Life can be applied to the theories and pr actice of both the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology. This thesis includes four images, an outlin e of two Western Esoteric Tradition rituals and a selected glossary of non-Jungian terms. Literature Review The sources used throughout this thesis fall into three general categories or themes. The first category is comprised of literature produced from within the Western Esoteric Tradition. The second is literature a nd sources produced from the various circles of analytical psychology and the third cate gory is comprised of sources, primarily the historical and phenomenological study of religion, which provides the historical background for Kabbalah and related spiritual a nd philosophical traditions. Before we look more closely at each of these categories we must review a cursory definition of the terms “Esoteric” and “Western Esoteric Trad ition” as they are used throughout this thesis. Later, in Chapter Three we will enter into a more complete definition of the Tradition. The scholar of esoteric traditions Antoin e Faivre uses the term “Occultism” when referring to the Western Esoteric Tradition. According to Faivre: “Occultism” is used in these two meanings: a) any practise dealing with these sciences [i.e., astrology, magic, alchemy, and the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 4 Kabbalah]. . .b) A current appear ing in the second half of the nineteenth century with Eliphas Lévi 1 and reaching its apogee at the turn of the century. 2 Our present concern is with definition “b)” but with one reservation. It would be difficult to concede that the Tradition or “current” re ached its apogee at the turn of the century when there would appear to be many more Orde rs and sources in exis tence today than at any time in the 19 th or early 20 th centuries combined. We should note that the term “Western Esoteric Tradition” is commonly used, along with the term “Western Mystery Tradition”, by those who follow the contempor ary revival of the second definition of Faivre's “Occultism” and it will be retained for the remainder of this thesis. Though not referring specifically (or even generally) to the Western Esoteric Tradition, Henry Corbin’s definition of esoteric ism is equally relevant to our analysis. Corbin states that esotericism refers “to the unavoidable necessity of expressing the reintegration of the human being with symbols.” 3 The Western Esoteric Tradition is historically linked to Faivre’s definition of O ccultism while the overall spiritual thrust of the Tradition is reflected in Corbin’s definition of esotericism. Western Esoteric Tradition Literature The literature produced from within th e Western Esoteric Tradition could be considered the least “academic” of the three aforementioned literature categories. This is   1 Alphonse Louis Constant (c1810-1875-better known under the pen-name Eliphas Levi) was a French deacon who wrote three major works on the occult: Transcendental Magic (1855), The History of Magic (1860), and The Key to the Grand Mysteries (1861). Each of these works (the latter being translated and published in Aleister Crowley's bi-annual occult periodical: The Equinox vol.1, no.x) helped to rekindle interest in the Western Esoteric Tradition. 2 Antoine Faivre, Access to Western Esotericism (New York: State University of New York Press, 1994), 34-35. 3 Henry Corbin cited in: Steven M Wasserstrom, Religion after Religion (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1999), 38."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 5 primarily due to the fact that the audience th at the authors are atte mpting to address are, for the most part, adherents or devotees of the Tradition. Metaphysical, philosophical, and cosmological assumptions are quite common with such sources, as would be the case for sources written by Christians, Buddhists, or any other spiritual practice for members of the same spiritual tradition. While the academic study of the Western Esoteric Tradition is gaining some momentum and valid ity, the majority of sources that analyse the Tradition come from within the Tradition and as a result tend to be less critical than standard academic sources. 4 Generally speaking, the West ern Esoteric literature can be subdivided into three supplementary categorie s: instructional, philosophical/historical, and reference. Instructional sources are by far the most common literature available today. A brief inventory of the “New Age/Occult” se ction of any major bookstore will reveal a plethora of titles that relate to training or edification within the Western Esoteric Tradition. This type of literature has always been a part of the Western Esoteric Tradition and has been refl ected throughout its mythology. Despite the f act that the secrets of the Tradition were intended to be concealed from the masses, instructional texts or grimoires have been available for centuries. 5   4 A sign of positive things to come in this particul ar area of research is th e recent publication of the Journal for the Academic Study of Magic (Oxford: Mandrake Press, 2003) not to mention more established journals such as Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism though the former is concerned more specifically with the form of Western Esotericism being analysed here. Rather than being bound to strict methodological structures (historical methodology for example), the Journal encourages multidisciplinary study of the Western Esoteric Traditi on and related practices and traditions. 5 The grimoires (“grammars”) which are usually comprised of instructions on performing acts of practical magic or spirit evocation, are commonly thought of as the personal notebooks of practitioners, and are thus inevitably filled with errors and remain partially incomplete, that eventually became textbooks of instruction for later adepts. Given the cost to buy or make books and the fact that the grimoires generally contain both Latin and Hebrew, it is obvious that th ese books were intended for the rich and educated. Some of the more important grimoires include the 13 th century The Grimoire of Pope Honorious (Seattle: Trident Books, 1999); the Medieval The Key of Solomon , trans. and ed. S. Liddell MacGregor Mathers, (ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1989) and the related Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King , trans. S."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 6 This type of literature is useful in ascertaining the cosmology of the Western Esoteric Tradition and, as they are created in order that they be understood and utilised, they are usually arranged in a systematic manner. However, anyone who has ever attempted to analyse an instructional text written from within the Tradition knows full well that many presumptions are made of the reader and at times th ere can be a trying lack of citation. Fortunately m odern Esotericists have learned from the chaos of the past, to some degree at least, and have made more rigorous attempts at clearly communicating their teachings. Aside from the more recognisable and cla ssic authors such as Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and Israel Regardie, there are several contemporary authors who have contributed important instructional works. 6 Following the Golden Dawn 7 tradition of the Western Esoteric Tradition, a nd mirroring Regardie’s attemp t to save the tradition by keeping its teachings in publication, Chic and Sandra Cicero have several important works to their credit. Of their works, Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn Tradition 8 is the most systematic and thorough guide to th e teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. From the outset, the practiti oner is introduced to esoteric symbolism and meditation practices that are gradually built upon through techni ques of increasing complexity and depth. In many ways this work acts as a reference resource as much as it       Liddell MacGregor Mathers, ed. Aleister Crowley, (ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1995); and the 17 th century The Grimoire of Armadel , trans. and ed. S. Liddell MacGregor Mathers, (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2001). 6 Crowley (1875-1947), Fortune (1891-1946), and Regardie (1907-1985) are classic figures within the Western Esoteric Tradition. The literature produced by these three individuals represents some of the most influential literature within the Western Esoteric Tradition and will be used throughout this thesis. 7 The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was an Esoteric order that was founded in 1888 and splintered in 1918 with the death of its autocrat, MacGregor Ma thers. Chapter Three will go into more detail about the Golden Dawn. 8 Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero, Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn Tradition , 2 nd ed.

To the Ciceros’ and Kraig we can add the works of William Gray, 11 Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, 12 Jason Augustus Newcomb, 13 Gerald J. Schueler, 14 Peter J. Carroll, 15 and Norman Kraft, 16 to name a few key authors. In every case the premise behind the work is instruction, with varying levels of complexity and styles of teachings. It is through these teachings that we can ascertain the assumptions and the cosmology of the Western Esoteric Tradition. The philosophical/historical sources are as varied in approach as the instructional sources. Some of the most popular works fr om within this sub-category come from Gareth Knight.

Knight’s A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism 17 is an amalgamation of two shorter and complementary works and is equal to Fortune’s The Mystical Qabalah in both insight and depth. 18 Of interest specifically in our present investigation is the fact that Knight makes multiple references to Jung and archetypal images, though he admittedly has little time for Jung’s th eories as he finds them too limiting. 19 More historically and loosely psycholog ically oriented is Knight’s Magic and the Western Mind . 20 While sweeping in its scope and limited in depth (a mere 197 pages of material covering centuries of esoteric and psychological developmen t) this source does attempt to give both the psycholo gical and cultural precursors of th e Western Esoteric Tradition. Similar to Magic and the Western Mind in historical scope is Manly P. Hall’s The Secret Teachings of All Ages . 21 Although Hall’s work is concer ned with symbols from various religions and organisations (such as the Freemasons) and not specifically with the Western Esoteric Tradition, many Esotericists have been infl uenced by this staple of esoteric study. One source that seems to be neglected in assessing the historical foundations of modern Western Esoteric Tradition is The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor . 22 Partially historical/philosophical and pa rtially instructional, this work has a thorough historical introduction to the teachings of this seminal 19 th century Order.

In most branches of the Western Esoteric Tradition various types of reference materials are used as part of the Traditi on’s practice. Standa rd encyclopaedias of mythology, religion, Freemasonry, and psychology are likely to be found referenced within the writings of the Tradition. Howe ver, some sources used within the Tradition are created for specifi c practices such as gematria . 23 For example, David Godwin’s Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia 24 is arranged in alphabetical order (English and Hebrew words are given) and the numeration of the words are listed in ascending numeric order as well. In practice one would find a word, see the definition and calculated sum of that word then simply turn to the gematria section to find what other words have the same sum for comparison. Aside from the pragmatic applications of the Cabalistic Encyclopedia , Godwin also gives a brief but useful introduction to the Western Esoteric Tradition and its practices. Another example of this type of reference source can be found in Crowley’s 777 and Other Qabalistic Wr iting’s of Aleister Crowley . 25 Several Western Esoteric sources ma ke use of Jung’s writings.

We see a similar situation in relation to coverage of the Western Esoteric Tradition from the perspective of the various branches of analytical psychol ogy. Though there may be a lack of sources directly related to the Western Esoteric Tr adition we do see that analytical psychology has done a fair bit of work in related areas. One source that attempted to link analyt ical psychology and the Western Esoteric Tradition is Alta J. LaDage’s Occult Psychology . 26 Similar in breadth and scope to Knight’s Magic and the Western Mind , LaDage attempts to co mpare her understanding of Western Esoteric Kabbalah and analytical psychology. However, as noble as her attempt is she falls short of an academically viable work. 27 This fact is not lost on the author as she states that her book “is not intended to be ‘scien tific’ or even rational!” 28 Another serious proble m with this work is that it makes incorrect assumptions regarding fundamental Jungian concepts. For example, LaDage indicates that the collective unconscious is, in essence, a type of Akashic Record. 29 LaDage, discussing dead “Uncle Joe” as an example, claims Jung implied that “all that Uncle Joe had thought and desired resides in the Collective Unconsci ous as a memory bundle, together with all that anyone ever thought about Uncle Joe. Furthermore, th is Uncle Joe lump [sic] is autonomous, according to Jung.” 30 Reference to Uncle Joe (and lack of references to Jung) aside, this reading of Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious as a place where individual personalities eternally dwell is patently incorrect.   26 Alta J. LaDage, Occult Psychology: A Comparison of Jungian Psychology and the Modern Qabalah (Saint Paul, MINN: Llewellyn Publications, 1978). 27 One major problem is the fact that the author makes citations without referring to specific texts or pagination. 28 LaDage, Occult Psychology , ix. 29 Theosophical concept that memories of events, thoughts, and emotions from the beginning of time are stored in an ethereal substance, Akasha. 30 LaDage, Occult Psychology , 87."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 11 However, for its shortfalls Occult Psychology is attempting, as is this thesis, to explore the connections between analytical psychology and the Western Esoteric Tradition. LaDage makes a meaningful observation when she compares the processes of the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology: There is a significant point of difference in the technique between Jung and the Qabalah, for the prac tical Qabalist actively assaults the unknown. That is his duty, to strip the veils, one by one, from the images that conceal the po wers. Jung did develop the technique of “active imagination” for exploring the unconscious, but this is a fairly simple method compared to the hi ghly controlled and ritualized methods of the Practical Qabalah. 31 Again, LaDage seems to misunderstand or pe rhaps underestimate the efficiency of the methods of analytical psychology to access and navigate the collective unconscious. However, mutual appreciation of the methods of both Esotericists and psychologists can prove to be a beneficial undertaking, though not without a level of difficulty. This final citation from LaDage equally sums up the perceptions underpinning the writing of this thesis. “Neither group has any pa rticular interest in being asso ciated with the other. The psychologists will criticize me for being mystical and the occultists will criticize me for abandoning the purity of the ancient doctrine and selling out to science. But so be it!” 32 Analytical Psychology Literature Analytical psychology has, for the mo st part, viewed religion and mystical traditions with appreciation and openness. Fo r Jung traditions such as alchemy reflected, at least to his mind, a historical predecessor to his psychological theories. Jungian icon Marie-Louise von Franz made several important forays into elucid ating the connection   31 LaDage, Occult Psychology , 121. 32 LaDage , Occult Psychology , ix."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 12 between esoteric practices and theories a nd those practices and theories found within analytical psychology. 33 We also find notable contributio ns in “occult” arts such as alchemy made by an equally influential analyst, Edward Edinger. 34 Several analysts have also analysed the connection be tween Tarot and Jung’s theories. 35 However, Tarot, as an organised system of spiritual development, ha s been refined over the past several decades by Western Esoteric practitioners; yet the de pths of the tradition remain relatively untouched by analytical psychology. There has been some important resear ch done on the connection between Jung and Jewish Kabbalah, such as th e work done by Sanford L. Drob, 36 Siegmund Hurwitz, 37 and Freema Gottlieb. 38 Yet none of these sources deals with the Kabbalah of the Western Esoteric Tradition as a unique entity. Even when presented with a direct link between analytical psychology and the We stern Esoteric Tradition ther e tends to be a lack of a systematic analysis. One example can be found in Jungian analyst J. Marvin Spiegelman’s The Tree of Life , a source endorsed by Esoteric ist Israel Regardie (who tended to have a limited enthusiasm for analytic al psychology).

One possible exception to the lack of analytical psychological research on the Western Esoteric Tradition can be found in th e writings of analyst and proponent of the “men’s movement” Robert L. Moore. The qualifier “possible” is used due to the fact that Moore never fully defines what he means by “occultism.” Moore indicates in his work The Magician and the Analyst: The Archetype of the Magus in Occult Spirituality and Jungian Analysis 40 that he initially set out to inve stigate his assumption that ritual involvement in occult practices was to acco unt for various forms of pathologies he observed in his psychothe rapeutic clients. Moore conducted interviews with young occultists where “many varieties of minority religions presented themselves, from theosophy to neo-paganism...” 41 Moore concluded that: What I discovered in this world of wizards and witches did not conform to my expectations. I foun d that most of what I had learned about the occult from graduate school and anti-cultist clinicians was at best simplistic and misleading, and at worst incredibly out of touch with human experience in both secular and religious kinds of ritualization. 42 While Moore’s respect for occult traditi ons is commendable and his subsequent work on sacred space in ritual and analysis is useful, he still fails to define what he means   39 J.

Moore seems to imply that anything from “theosophy to neo-paganism” is occultism. When Moore mentions “theosophy” is he referring to the Theosophical Society began by Madame Helena Blavatsky in 1875 or is he being more general and using the term to describe loosely gnostic traditions that follow Kabbalistic or Neo- platonic world-views? By “Neo-pagan” does Moore mean those who follow various forms of folk traditions and their modern revivals or do es he include here modern traditions such as Wicca? Are all nature-bas ed religions that emphasise the immanence of divinity also included in this definition? Moore makes no differentiation between any of these traditions. Eventually in The Magician and the Analyst Moore does finally reveal to the reader, in equally obtuse terms, what he means when he uses the term “occultism.” Moore states that he wishes to “distinguish between occultism prope rly so-called and the wide spread interest in such topics as Ufology and the Bermuda Triangle.” 43 In order to aid in this differentiation Moor e employs the sociol ogist E.A. Tiryankian’s definition of “the occult.” The definition, as cited by Moor e can be summarised as a set of volitional practices, conducted by someone who has specialised knowledge of such practices, that draw on natural hidden or concealed forces, that cannot be measured by modern science which result in the desired empirical results. 44 Moore then goes on to explore and compare what he calls the archetype of initiation with the sociological and anthropolog ical concepts of sacr ed and profane space and liminal and liminoid space.

We will look more closely at this claim in Chapter Four when we see how Moore’s model of the ma le psyche (using the archetypes of the Magician, Warrior, King, and Lover) parallel th e Western Esoteric Tree of Life. This parallel structure could indicate that M oore was influenced by the Western Esoteric Tradition, especially its understanding of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Another possibility is that his model, like the Tree of Life, reflects archetypal patterns that both the Western Esoteric Tradition and analyt ical psychology have observed and analysed (Moore acknowledges neither possibility). In a more general application, Petteri Piet ikäinen offers an insightful review of some of the historical influences that helped shape Jung’s thought on symbol. 45 Despite Pietikäinen’s insights, little has been done to look at how the symbolic focus of the Western Esoteric Tradition and the writings of its primary spokespersons, parallel Jung’s concepts. In many ways Jung’s understanding of Kabbalah and alchemy are not traditional, “orthodox” interpreta tions. The interpretations tend to reflect the approach and structure of the Western Esoteric Tradition. That is not to say there is a direct correlation of influence between Jung and th e Western Esoteric Tradition but there are most certainly important connections a nd correspondences that we will review throughout this thesis.

Two authors, Edward Hoffman and Sanf ord L. Drob (mentioned above), have made significant contributions to the conn ections between psychology and Kabbalah. Hoffman, a clinical psychologist, is conc erned with demonstr ating the correlation between Kabbalah and psychology, while also looking at the larger, overarching picture of the relevance of Kabbalah in modern societ y. Of particular interest is a chapter by Alice R. Trensfeld in Opening the Inner Gates , edited by Edward Hoffman. The chapter, entitled “Psychosynthesis and Kabbalah: New Convergence for Inner Work” links Assagioli’s Egg Diagram of the psyche with the Tree of Life as understood in Jewish Kabbalah. 47 The similarities between Jung’s model of the psyche and that of Assagioli demonstrate a precedent in applying the Tree of Life to a particular branch of depth psychology. 48 However, while Trensfeld analysed the connection or interpenetration between psychology and Jewish Kabbalah this thesis will analyse the connection between analytic psychology and the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. Though not directly related, both Hoffman’s and Trensfeld’s work demonstr ate the malleability of the Tree of Life and its ability to be applied to the structure of the psyche. Drob, Director of Psychological Assessmen t and the Senior Forensic Psychologist at Bellevue Hospital, New York, focuses more on the philosophical and theoretical influences of Kabbalah thr oughout history.

Drob’s cl aim is that the alchemical traditions studied by Jung actually had their roots in Jewish Kabbalah or, at the very least, were heavily influenced by Kabbalistic concepts. We will return to Jung’s use of Kabbalah in Chapter Two. 49 While never specifically referring to the Western Esoteric Tradition or those who operate from within the Tradition, David Tacey offers some interesting insights into the relation between Jung and the New Age movement in his Jung and the New Age . 50 Of great interest and importance is Tace y’s claim that the New Age movement: goes wrong to the extent that it advocates a new one-sidedness to heal the old one-sidedness...it l acks a guiding philosophy or an inclusive theology that might enable it to bring spirit and nature, God as Father and God as Mother , Logos and Eros, into a right relationship or an in tegrative wholeness. 51 This imbalance is a potential concern in the New Age movement whereas in contradistinction, the Western Esoteric Tradition focuses on the integration of opposing factors; nowhere is this more clearly eviden t than in their use and application of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Given the perennial nature of much of the material from within the Western Esoteric Tradition and Jung’s wr iting, it is important to mention some of the current postmodern work being done within analytical psychological circles.

In a sim ilar vein, Susan Rowland’s exceptional work Jung: A Feminist Revision is also extremely useful in giving some of Jung’s “grand theories” a postmodern interpretation. 54 On the side of the Western Esoteric Tradition, the authors writing from the perspective of Ch aos Magick (known as Chaoists) are a good representation of a postmodern approach to the grand theories of the Tradition. 55 While the purpose of the thesis is not to examine th e postmodern interpretation of either Jung or the Western Esoteric Tradition, the postmode rn perspective can give an alternative interpretation of both Jungian thought and the assumptions of the Western Esoteric Tradition by acknowledging and resitu ating the grand narratives of each. History of Religion Literature The final category of sources is comprised of works, primarily historical, that are concerned with subjects that contribute to the underlying structures of the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology. Jung’s main sources for Kabbalah included Gersholm Scholem 56 , R.J.

Jung also wrote a forward to Werblowsky’s Lucifer and Prometheus (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1952) which can be found in CW 11, pars. 468-473 and he exchanged several letters with Werblowsky ( Letters v.2, pp. 15-17, 69-71, 116-117 and 122-123. From the letters we can see that there was a mutual exchange between Jung and Werblowsky with Werblowsky helping Jung to understand Kabbalah and its relation to Judaism and Jung commenting on Werblowsky’s understanding of analytical psychology. 58 Bischoff edited and translated Elemente der Kabbalah (1913) and is cited in “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 313n and Mysterium Coniunctionis, CW 14 , par. 158n. 59 Frank wrote La Kabbale (1843), the German translation was Die Kabbala (1844).

As many of the spiritual tr aditions that are an alysed employ specific terms that may have a unique context to th eir own world-view, the reader should be reminded that there is a glossary of non-Jungi an terms at the back of this thesis. The sources from within the Western Esot eric Tradition tend to misuse Jungian thought or, as is more generally the case, the theories are taken out of context or presented in an oversimplified manner. The fa ct that the Esotericists mention Jung in some of their writings indicates that they do find some affinity between analytical psychology and their own world-view. In th e case of analytical psychology, there has been little research into the rituals, pract ices and beliefs of the Western Esoteric Tradition. This omission is unfortunate for se veral reasons but two of the most important are: first, the primary writers used throughout this thesis were contemporaries of Jung and they therefore share, at the very least, a common link to a tumultuous period of history in which the development in psychology wa s underway, the worl d experienced two watershed wars as well as the following pe riod of disenchantment. Second and more specifically, analytical psychology and the West ern Esoteric Tradition share an emphasis on images, symbols and metaphor. As products of the collective unc onscious, analytical psychology would do well to plumb the depths of the Western Esoteric Tradition—a tradition that is as vibrant and valid as Gnosticism or alchemy. Authors such as Regardie, the Ciceros, LaDage, Fortune, Knight and Crowley do make limited use of or references to Jung’s psychology but they do so from the bias of their own world-view.

The Esot eric Tradition posits that these experiences occur on other, ontological planes of existen ce than our own. The psyche, if mentioned, is generally seen as an intermediate between th is world and the others. It almost seems as though Jung threatens their world-view when in fact analytical psychology offers an important alternative interpre tation of their cosmology. Sim ilarly, there tends to be a distrust of the Western Esoteric Tradition (especially Aleister Crowley) from some academics, this too is unfortunate. 68 This thesis differs from the listed Esoteric sources in that it does not operate from the Western Esoteric world-view. However, the emphasis on spiritual development and evolution found within the Tradition is retained as the primary focus in the current study. And while there is an emphasis on the psyc he that emphasis does not preclude the possibility of a more literal interpretation of the Tradition. We simply have no way to prove or disprove the metaphysical claims of the Western Esoteric Tradition. However, we are able to interpret such metaphysical claims from an analytical psychological perspective. This thesis is also unique fr om analytical psychologi cal sources that touch on aspects of the Western Esoteric Tradition (suc h as Tarot for example) in that there is a sustained analysis of key concepts found w ithin the Tradition as reflected in the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life.

The overall purpose of this thesis is to open an ongoing dialogue between analytical psychology and the Western Esoteric Tradition. The Esotericists’ familiarity and practised contact with symbol and meta phor make them a suitable subject for study by analytical psychology. As well, analytic al psychology offers th e Western Esoteric Tradition an alternative perspective that emphasises a balanced approach towards the depths of the unconscious—a perspective that values a healthy relationship between the ego-complex, the personal and collective unconsci ous, and the world as a whole.

Magick and Metaphor: De fining Two Key Terms There are two key terms used throughout this thesis that will need to be defined. The first term, Magick, is described fully in Chapter Three. 69 The term “Magick” implies a symbol system that incorporates various me thods of art and science and applies them to changing human consciousness; the term is al so used synonymously with the Western   69 See p.113."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 23 Esoteric Tradition. The remaining term, metaphor, will now be defined in a more thorough manner. A Brief Review of Metaphor There has been a long history of deba te around the importance and definition of metaphor. On the most basic level metaphor lit erally means “to transfer”, “to bare” or “to carry”. 70 That which is being transferred is meaning and it is this transference of meaning that makes metaphor an interest, with varying degrees of popularity and support, to many disciplines such as semiotics, liter ature and linguistics, science, philosophy and psychology. The following is an outline of so me of the key interp retations of metaphor from an analytical and archetypal psychologi cal perspective. Given the philosophical depth and complexity of metaphor, we will be unable to engage in any in-depth analysis of the term. The most common understanding of metaphor is that it is a figure of speech or trope. Metaphor is a trope in which a word or a phrase that literall y denotes one thing is used to denote another, thereby implicitly comparing the two things. Metaphor can be seen as descriptive decorations for words or th ey can be seen as elliptical similes as was popular in the 19 th C. 71 Another definition is that me taphor is the “transference of a name, quality, action to a subject or object different from, though by implication analogous to, that to which this name, quality, action is implied when taken literally.” 72   70 From the Latin/Greek metaphora - metapherõ “transfer”. 71 Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy , 2 nd ed.

(London: Routledge, 2001), 243."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 24 The following analysis of metaphor will focus on how metaphor is perceived and applied within analytical and archetypal psychology. 73 Metaphor in Analytical and Archetypal Psychology In his “The Psychology of the Child Archetype” Jung states that an “archetypal content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors. If such content should speak of the sun and identify with it the lion, the king, the hoard of gold guarded by the dragon, or the power that makes for life a nd health of man, it is neithe r the one thing nor the other, but an unknown third thing that finds more or less adequate expression in all these similes, yet—to the perpetual vexation of the intellect—remains unknown and not to be fitted into a formula.” 74 For Jung, and especially in his theory of dream analysis 75 , metaphor is an integral part of the human psyche. Where there are archetypes there are metaphors though, given the vast array of meta phors in our language the reverse is not necessarily true. Jung also discusses metaphor in Jung’s Seminar on Nietzsche’s Zarathustra . In this case, Jung focuses specifically on Nietzsche’s use of metaphors of opposition, not   73 Though we will not be dealing specifically with me taphor within the contex t of analysis Guiseppe Maffei’s “Metaphors and Development of Knowledge” in Harvest: Journal for Jungian Studies , vol. 40 (London: C.G.

For a selection of non-psychological sources on metaphor see: Aristotle’s Poetics (George Whalley, Aristotle’s Poetics (Montreal and Kingston: McGill- Queens University Press, 1997)); Giambattista Vico’s La Scienza Nuova (See, for example: Giambattista Vico, New Science , Anthony Grafton, trans.

Jung mentions Nietzsche’s “love of the metaphor of ice and snow and cold—all that contrasts with the heat. He understands th at spirit is chiefly hot...and the contrast would be extremely cold.” 76 While Jung does not often refer directly to metaphor, the topic of metaphor is an important one in Jungian and post- Jungian thought. Jolande Jacobi discusses the “translati on of archetypal ideals into symbolic happening” 77 , in her Complex, Archetype, Symbol in the Psychology of C.G. Jung . In this work, Jacobi equates metaphor with parable but states that “Jungi an psychology prefers to use the word ‘symbol’ for such sequen ces as well as for si ngle, self-contained images.” 78 Geraldine Godsil’s “Winter’s Ragge d Hand—Creativity in the Face of Death” approaches the subject of metaphor in the context of transformation and rebirth. 79 Godsil states that space and movement ar e two key features of metaphor thereby emphasising the etymology of the word “to carry over.” 80 Godsil continues by linking metaphor and symbol together with reference to Jung: The mind moves between two im ages reflecting on the likeness and difference; it traverses boundar ies, it explores identity, it carries something new. Jung writes that the ‘symbol needs man for its development. But it grows beyond him, therefore it is called ‘God’ since it expresses a psychic si tuation or factor stronger that the ego.’ The idea of rebirth is intrinsic to metaphor which creates something new out of the already existing and familiar. 81   76 Jung, Jung’s Seminar on Nietzsche’s Zarathustra , edited and abridged by James L.

Lionel Corbett warns against the pr emature introduction of myth and amplification within the confines of analysis. Ho wever, he also states that “it is also true that the power of story and metaphor (like art, dance or music) can bypass defensive operations and move the soul much more directly than the same idea expressed as an abstract concept or interpretation.” 82 Metaphor, in this context, is a means to move past the boundary of the ego-complex. In “The Psychological Use of Fairy Tales”, Crowther, Haynes and Newton state that a child’s favourite storie s “have to be told over an d over again and function as metaphors for the child’s ongoing concerns which are often fraught with anxiety...Children respond to the tales in many different ways: they may experience joy, misery or reassurance that the tale relates, often in disguised form, feelings and emotions they recognise to be true of their own experience.” 83 Metaphor, in this case, functions as the link between the actual fairytale and the subjective emotiona l and psychological experience of the reader or listener which, in turn, acts as a guide for development.

Metaphors are more than ways of speaking; they are ways of perceiving, feeling, and existing.” 90 As cited above, Jung analysed metaphors of opposition in Nietzsche’s writings. For Hillman it is not so much metaphors of opposition that are of interest but the paradoxical nature of metaphor and by extension, consciousness. As an example of this endemic paradox Hillman gives the example of “Richard the lion”. Is “Richard the lion” a lion in a cag e named Richard or is Richard a courageous king? Hillman states th at “this well known example is too simple, for many kinds of metaphors have been dist inguished and named; but it serves to illustrate the basic idea: psychological consci ousness, because it sees through, because it flourishes in ambiguity, is metaphorical.” 91 Hillman echoes Jung’s statement that ar chetypes are metaphorical stating that archetypes “belong to the intern al self-contradiction and dup licity of mythic metaphors, so that every statement regarding the archetypes is to be taken metaphorically , prefixed with an “as if.” 92 He also indicates that “[m]yt hic metaphor is the correct way of speaking about the archetypes because, like Gods, they do not stand still.

Hillman states that: [m]ythic consciousness does not need an “as-if”. So long as the ideas are not fixed into singlene ss of meaning, we do not need to pry them loose with the tool of “as-if”. Vaihinger after all derives from Kant and in reaction to Kant ’s categorical monotheistic mind. “As-if” is a necessary philosoph ical step for recognizing the metaphorical character of all certai nties in what we see, say and believe. But if we begin in mythical consciousness we do not need the prefix. It is implied throughout, always. 95 Related to the same line of argument, Hillman questions Jung’s assumption that archetypes are unknowable in themselves 96 by suggesting that it is not the archetype that is ultimately unknowable but our method of pe rception that makes it appear that way: “We have no clear distinct knowledge of them in themselves and by themselves in the Cartesian sense of certainty; but we know them indirectl y, metaphorically, mythically.” 97 Roberts Avens’ Imagination is Reality is a useful amplification of some of archetypal psychology’s use of metaphor. 98 In this work, Avens quotes literary philosopher Owen Barfield’s definition of metaphor: Metaphor, says Barfield, involves a tension between two ostensibly incompatible meanings, reflecting a deeper tension within ourselves—“a tension between that part of ourselves which experiences the incompatibilities as a mysterious unity and that part which remains well able to appreciate their duality and their incompatibility.

He suggests that “a new experience of reality (a Western nirv ana) has been made possible through Jung’s rehabilitation of the mythical or archetyp al dimension of the psyche, leading to the realization that images, in their liberated mode, are themse lves embodiments of meaning; that they mean what they are and are what they mean.” 100 Of Hillman Avens writes: The importance of archetypal psycho logy is that it has chosen the path of watchful attention to the imaginal realm, giving, in Hillman’s words, “the psyche a chance to move out of the consulting room”—a chance, that is to say, to be yoked (in the Yogic sense of union) to its archai c, emotional and creative core. In moving beyond the personal a nd back into the unknown, archetypal ground of all life, psychology only follows the tradition of classical and archaic peoples who solved the problems of the psyche through personal relations hips (abreactive encounters, humanizing) but through the reverse” “connecting them to impersonal dominants” and pr oviding for the psyche “ impersonal satisfaction.” 101 Jung and Hillman, analytical psychology a nd archetypal psychology, assign value to images and metaphor. That value is, at its mo st basic core, of connecting to aspects of ourselves we are not generally cognisant of while dwelling in, as Hillman indicated above, a Cartesian persp ective.

The Western Esoteric Tradition has a rich history of symbolism and the practice of communication and interaction with entities of various types. There are spirits of the elements and planets, there are the legions of angels and archangels, not to mention demons, devils and dukes, there are the angels of the Enochian system, and then there is the Holy Guardian Angel. 102 These entities are taken to be more or less literal beings or if not literal then they are unde rstood to have literal value or impact in the practitioner’s life. Why is it, then, that metaphor should be introduced in to this analysis of the Western Esoteric Tradition’s interpretation of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and therefore the Tradition itself? First, as Jung has indicated 103 , where there is an archetype there is metaphor. If we are to assume that the experiences of the Western Esotericists are, in fact, expressions of psychological processes then the symbolic nature of their tradition would point to archetypal, symbolic expression. We would then need to look at the nature of metaphor from that perspective. Ra ther than reducing the symbols, metaphors or archetypes to just contents of the psyche, Jung indicates metaphor allows for, what amounts to, a neither/nor perspective that acknow ledges parallel metaphori cal terms retain their individual nature yet do not e xhaust the “unknown third thing”. 104 Two benefits of this perspective are that we avoid the trap of concretised fundamentalism 105 and, as Godsil   102 These terms will be explored in more detail throughout the thesis. 103 Jung, “The Psychology of the Child Archetype”, CW 9i , par. 267. 104 Jung, “The Psychology of the Child Archetype”, CW 9i , par. 267. 105 Tacey, Jung and the New Age , 138."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 32 has suggested, there is an intrinsic link between metaphor and the idea of rebirth. 106 By moving from the literal perspective of the Western Esoteric Traditi on, we are free to, in Godsil’s words, “[create] something new out of the already existing and familiar.” 107 If we understand metaphor in this psychological way we are analysing not figures of speech but “ways of perceiving, feeling, and existing.” 108 This way of perceiving and existing has an intimate link with imagination which “has the uncanny ability to see the inner life of things and to assure us that th ere is more in our experience of the world than meets the eye...there is...salvation from a ‘universe of death’.” 109 The metaphorical and archetypal perspectives have, according to Avens, opened to a new perspective, a “Western nirvana”. 110 Avens, Hillman and Jung approach metaphor from the perspective that it is something more involved than a trope or a tool of language; it is seen as a psychic reality that has the potential to have a prof ound impact on the psyche and ontological perspective. Metaphors are evocative and transformative in their psychological form; they mould our perceptions and perspectives. For our purposes metaphor will follow the thought of analytical and archetypal psychology outlined above while retaining the literal meaning of “to transfer” “to bare” “to carry”. The sefirot of the Tree of Life and the symbols and rituals of the Western Esoteric Tradition can be viewed as metaphors that transfer, bare and carry psychological mean ing—a meaning that mirrors what Jung labelled the process of individuation or becoming ps ychologically whole.   106 Godsil, “Winter’s Ragged Hand”, 252. 107 Godsil, “Winter’s Ragged Hand”, 252. 108 Hillman, Re-visioning , 156. 109 Avens, Imagination is Reality , 23. 110 Avens, Imagination is Reality , 40."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 33 From a metaphorical perspective, the sefirot refer to aspects of our psyche rather than being part of a literal divine being a nd the entities encountered from the parameters of the Western Esoteric Tradition are taken in a similar vein.

The following citation from Jung illustrates metaphor especially well: “Ideas are not just counters used by the calculating mind; they are also golden vessels full of living feeling. ‘F reedom’ is not a mere abstraction, it is an emotion. Reason becomes unreason when separa ted from the heart, and a psychic life void of universal ideas sick ens from undernourishment.” 111 Ideas, the gold en vessels of living feeling, are permeated by metaphor and, as in the cases of metaphors such as “Mother”, “Tree”, or “God” there is a sense of direction and teleology that points to or hints at a sense of completion and wholeness.

Several Gentile spiritual traditions have incorporated the sefirot along with other Kabbalistic principles. Though the meaning attributed to th e term may change from culture to culture and symbol-system to symbol-system there still remains a common principle. The principle common in all uses of the term is or der and definition.

So as to avoid confusion, it would be germane for us to briefly review these differences. In Jewish Kabbalah and the Western Esot eric Tradition, the term macrocosm (sometimes Macrocosm) is used to denote the divine or cosmic realms while the microcosm (sometimes Microcosm) is represen tational of the realm of human existence; the latter being a reflection of the former. 4 The definitions are similar in Jung’s writings though he defines the microcos m as both the human realm 5 and the collective unconscious. 6 Jung defines the macrocosm as representative of the “firmament” 7 and “revolving universe.” 8 Jung follows the standard esoteric definition of these terms, as would be expected since most of his sources on this subject are esoteric works, with the addition of the microcosm being equal to th e collective unconscious. The final way the terms microcosm and macrocosm are utilised can be found in Chapter Four with the introduction of the analytical psychological interpre tation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. This new interpretation of the Esoteric Tr ee of Life changes the roles of the terms microcosm and macrocosm. The microcosm is taken to mean not only the human being;   4 See: Israel Regardie, The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic , 3 rd ed. edited and annotated by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero (St. Paul, MINN: Ll ewellyn Publications, 2002), 96. 5 Jung, “Synchronicity: An Ac ausal Connecting Principle”, CW 8 , par. 926 and 928. 6 Jung, “Synchronicity: An Ac ausal Connecting Principle”, CW 8 , par. 931. 7 Jung, “Synchronicity: An Ac ausal Connecting Principle”, CW 8 , par. 929. 8 Jung, “Religious Ideas in Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 472."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 37 it also implies his or her position in the ma terial universe itself. Humanity and its environment (terrestrial and cosmic) are thereby inseparably in terconnected, a stance implied by the esotericists by indicating that the macrocosm is but reflected in the microcosm. The macrocosm in this case is that which animates and vivifies the microcosm, i.e., the psyche and the collec tive unconscious as well as the metaphorical and symbolic aggregates which populate them . In this manner the “divine” influence comes not from without, not from the stars or the sky but from within the psyche. While the first two definitions of micro and macr ocosms, the esotericist’s and Jung’s, are similar, the latter, a proposition posited for th e analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life, is divergent and unconvent ional in that the macrocosm is not the exterior universe but the depths of the interior, psychic universe. Ten Sefirot of Nothingness: The sefirot in Jewish Kabbalah No creature can take aim at the unknown, hidden God. In the last resort, every cognition of God is based on a form of relation between Him and His creature, i.e. on a manifestation of God in some thing else, and not on a relation between Him and Himself . 9 As stated in the introduction, the term sefirot is most commonly applied to Judaism and Jewish Kabbalah. The most direct way to understand and define the sefirot within this tradition is to l ook to early Kabbalistic literature for answers. However, the first written source that uses the term sefirot is not, in fact, a Kabbali stic text at all. The Sefer Yetsirah 10 is a compact, “proto-Kabbalistic” co smological text written in a poetic   9 Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Shocken Books, 1973), 11. 10 Literally, “Book of Creation.” As with any of these Hebrew terms there are variations in spelling.

Written between 3 rd and 6 th century CE, this six chapter, 1500-2500 word (depending on the version) work has had a monumental impact on Jewish Kabbalah. One would not be exaggerating to state that aside from the Sefer Bahir 11 no other text has had a more pervasive and fundamental or elemental impact on Jewish Kabbalah than the Yetsirah . Even the revered Sefer ha-Zohar owes much of its content to the Yetsirah . One of the more important claims of the Yetsirah is that the letters/numbers of the Hebrew alphabet are sacred, magical entiti es. Through words and numbers God created the universe and everything in it. By arranging and rear ranging the lette rs God could change reality. 12 Given the importance of the Hebr ew alphabet it would prudent to present it before continuing on: Table One: The Hebrew Alphabet א Aleph 1 ב Beth 2 ג Gimmel 3 ד Daleth 4 ה Heh 5 ו Vau  6 ז Zayin  7 ח Chet 8 ט Tet 9 י Yod  10 כ Kaph 20 ל Lamed 30 מ Mem 40 נ Nun  50 ס Samekh 60 ע Eyin 70 פ Peh 80 צ Tzadi 90 ק Qof 100 ר Resh 200 ש Shin 300 ת Tav 400   11 See below. 12 The Kabbalistic concept of the golem is a wonderful example of the po wer of the Hebrew alphabet. The golem is a magical, non-human entity that is ritually created through the use of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

This cosmology would come to play a prominent role in Kabbalistic lore. 14 Aside from the mystical permutations of letters and numbers, the Yetsirah also contains the first mention (in writing at least) of the term sefirot :  Ten Sefirot of Nothingness And 22 Foundation Letters:  Three Mothers,   Seven Doubles   And twelve Elementals. 15 In the above account, the sefirot are not tangible or identifiable “objects”. They represent the most basic and subtle constructs of reality. They are the sources of the numbers. 16 Again, the concept of the sefirot in the Sefer Yetsirah do not have the same definitions as the later Kabbalists would attribute to them. The s efirot are defined as being Nothing ( beli - mah - בלימה ) where beli means “without” and mah “what” or “anything”. This in terpretation of “nothingness” would imply the sefirot “are purely ideal concepts, without any substance whatever. Unlike letters which have form and sound, the Sefiro t have no intrinsic phys ical properties. As such, they are purely conceptual.” 17   13 We see this theme in the Hebrew bible in the first chapter of Genesis. The creator brings mater into existence through th e act of naming. 14 This subject of letters / numbers and their place in Kabbalah will be dealt with throughout this thesis. 15 Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation in theory and Practice (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1993), 22.

At this point in the Sefer Yetsirah the sefirot are not named. The concept is simply revealed in the text. In his translation of the Sefer Yetsirah , Kaplan states that while the sefirot are not named in the text they are well known from cl assical Kabbalah. 18 This interpretation is rather questionable. Applying later names and labels to the sefirot of an earlier pre- Kabbalistic text is projecting onto the text a structure which would not come into being for several centuries. Rather than apply these names to the sefirot at this time we will remain strictly within the text itself without applying later Kabbalistic concepts. What follows are some descriptive passages of the sefirot from Kaplan’s translation of the Yetsirah . Chapter 1:3 of the Sefer Yetsirah introduces the sefirot in a more corporeal context: Ten Sefirot of Nothingness in the number of ten fingers  five opposite five   with a singular covenant   precisely in the middle in the circumcision of the tongue and the circumcision of the membrum. 19 The fingers in the above citation are referr ing to God’s fingers of creation (Psalms 8:3—this citation is incorrectly gi ven by Kaplan as Psalms 8:4). 20 When God is said to directly influence the physical world, sc ripture speaks of God’s fingers or hands.   18 SY , 23. 19 SY , 32. 20 I am thankful to Caradoc Elmet for pointing this out to me."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 41 The circumcision of the tongue is not a reference to physical immolation but rather to the ability to manipulate the Hebrew language, to read the Torah.

The circumcision of the foreskin is the membrum that falls between these ten digits. Thus, through both forms of brit or covenants, we see a uniquely Jewish definition of the sefirot . With ten fingers, tongue, se xual organ, and ten toes the sefirot are reflected in the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This links the i ndividual’s body with scripture, his/her community, and God. 21 Chapter 1:5 introduces the notion that the sefirot and the “five dimensional [i.e., depths] continuum” are intimately connected: Ten Sefirot of Nothingness  Their measure is ten which have no end A depth of beginning A depth of end A depth of good A depth of evil A depth of above A depth of below A depth of east A depth of west A depth of north A depth of south 22 The dyads in the above citation reveal the three dimensions or depths of the universe.

What is in teresting is that we are lead to believe that the sefirot are not identified with God. The sefirot are in some way connected to God but they are not identical to God. There seems to be panentheistic undertones in this. Also in this chapter we are introduced to the first pragmatic application of the sefirot in the Sefer Yetsirah . The sefirot , like any object of visualisation meditation/contemplation, are fleeting without prope r concentration and training. To imply the sefirot can be seen or visualised i ndicates that they have some tangible quality. Given the aforem entioned descriptions of the sefirot , we can assume that the objectivity of the sefirot is symbolic and not tangible in nature. 26 Chapter 1:7 infers that the sefirot do not exist as independe nt entities (or any form of entity) and that each sefira is connected to the other: Ten Sefirot of Nothingness Their end is imbedded in their beginning and their beginning in their end like a flame in a burning coal For the Master is singular   24 SY , 44-51. 25 SY , 51. 26 SY , 51-56."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 43 He has no second And before One, what do you count? 27 Later Jewish Kabbalists (and Christian Kabbalists) will posit an intimate connection between the “first ” or most abstract/divine sefirot Kether with the “last” or least ethereal sefira, Malkut . 28 Early Christian Kabbalists viewed this relationship similar to the relationship between th e Christian understanding of th e Alpha and the Omega.

The sefirot begin to develop into less abstract ma nifestations through the arra ngement and meditation of the essence behind each sefira . 35 However, since this chapter is not on the Sefer Yetsirah per se , we will leave further analysis for those who are fully dedicated to extracting its wisdom. To summarise, the sefirot are simultaneously devoid of physical properties, yet are symbolised by the most intimate portions of the human being. They are unknowable, yet are present in all of creation. They reflect God, yet they are not God. They represent the most profound of human experiences yet they are elusive and potentially destructive. Even with the enthusiastic effort s of Kaplan the meaning of the sefirot still remains obscure, hidden...unconscious. This review of what would prove to be one of the most influential, pre-Kabbalistic texts has attempted to demonstrate how the term sefirot was employed prior to the refinement of later Kabbalistic traditions. The next text we will approach is the Sefer Bahir. The Bahir was the first truly Kabbalistic text to use the term sefira . The Sefer Bahir Again we will look to Kaplan for an Eng lish translation of the next text, the Sefer Bahir and once again we will circumvent Kaplan’s interpretation. 36 This exclusion is not due to any lack of validity or importance in his interpretations, but is instead due to the   35 SY , 68-71. 36 Aryeh Kaplan, The Bahir: Illumination (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1989).

The primary source for theories on the Bahir for this chapter will be the writings of Gershom Scholem. While Scholem dem onstrated little deference for Gentile interpretations of Kabbalah he still remains one of the most cited and influential scholars on the history and theories of Jewish Kabbalah. 37 The Sefer Bahir surfaced in Provence during the latter half of the 12 th century. The book, a pseudopigraphic work, is a combina tion of several different mystical texts and philosophical influences . Two of the more in fluential texts are the Sefer Yetsirah and the Raza Rabba. 38 For our present purposes we need not enter into a description of the Raza Rabba . The most important application of the Raza Rabba in the Bahir is the incorporation of Gnostic terminology and cosmology that w ill be dealt wit h, in a cursory fashion, later in this chapter. The Sefer Bahir is devoid of any obvious order or arrangement and seems to be incomplete. According to Kaplan the Bahir can be separated into five general themes: 1. The first verses of creation 2. The alphabet 3. The Seven Voices and the Sefirot 4. The Ten Sefirot 5. Mysteries of the soul 39   37 For example Scholem states in Major Trends : “ all manner of charlatans and dreamers came and treated it [Kabbalah] as their own property. From the brilliant misunderstandings and misint erpretations of Alphonse Louis Constant, who has won fame under the pseudonym of Eliphas Lévi, to the highly coloured humbug of Aleister Crowley and his followe rs, the most eccentric and fantastic statements have been produced purporting to be legitimate interpretations of Kabbalism.” Scholem, Major Trends , 2. 38 “The Great Mystery.” The text dates from the 2 nd –5 th centuries of the Comm on Era. According to Scholem, this Eastern text demonstrates one source of Gnostic influence on mediaeval Kabbalism. See: Scholem, Major Trends , 75 and Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , R.J.

Job, Genesis, Psalms, among others books are commented upon. The second theme in the Bahir reinforces many of the themes and cosmology of the Sefer Yetsirah . The sanctity and mystical nature of the Hebrew alphabe t is also reiterated. The nature of the sefirot is discussed within the third and fourth themes . The fifth theme introduces the notion of transmigration and reincarnation of the soul, and the relation between the human soul and divinity. In the Sefer Yetsirah we saw that the letters/numbers of the Hebrew alphabet are used as symbols for the creation and the perpetuation of the universe. These letters/numbers were/are divine in origin and in nature as well as highly abstract and esoteric. The Bahir is the first truly Kabbalistic text that refers to the sefirot as attributes ( middoth) of God. In Judaism, the prevailing theology is monotheistic and Kabbalism attempts to demonstrate how a transcendent, infinite, and paradoxical God can be present in a meaningful way in the world. One wa y of bridging these di chotomous world-views is to have God known through emanations. Gershom Scholem’s works Origins of the Kaballah and Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism link the Bahir with various streams of Gnostic thought. Sc holem indicates that these Gnostic influences may have been incorporated in Kabbalistic thought through direct contact or similar methods of exegesis. 40 The most apparent similarity is found in the Gnostic concepts of the pleroma and the aeons (and archons ) and the Kabbalistic   40 Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , 81. We should also note, however, that Scholem’s Gnostic reading of Kabbalah is not supported by all scholars. The writings of Moshe Idel, specifically Kabbalah: New Perspectives , indicates this clearly. For Idel, Scholem’s emphasis on a philological-historical (as opposed to a comparative phenomenological approach) to Kabbalah is too limiting. On Scholem and the Gnostic influence Idel states: “We find no more than passing remarks on Gnostic, Catharic, or Christian sources in Scholem’s works. Despite his recurrent insistence upon the influence of Gnosticism on Kabbalah, he never presented in his published works a thorough treatment of the relationship of the two.” Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), 23."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 48 understanding of the qualities, or middoth of God. 41 However, the Bahir deviates from traditional Gnostic cosmology. Whereas the Gnostic cosmologies have numerous even infinite aeons , (personifications of the pleroma ) the Kabbalists limited the powers to ten. This particular numeration has its source in the Sefer Yetsirah where the number ten was the number of the creation of the universe. According to Scholem, the limiting of the number of middoth lead to a number of symbolic names being attached to the middoth . At times these titles are contradictory or excessive ly malleable. Despite this anomaly the Bahir does express an attempt to introduce a standardis ation of terms. 42 The most apparent theme in the writings regarding the sefirot is the separation between three higher and seven lower sefirot . 43 The three higher sefirot are derived from Proverbs 3:19, 20. 44 Originally, Wisdom, Knowledge, and Understanding are the three upper sefirot . However, more common in late r Kabbalah, and specifically in the Bahir, the highest sefira is the Crown ( Kether ) with Wisdom ( Hokmah ) 45 and Understanding ( Binah ) completing the upper triad. Knowledge ( Da’at ) 46 is only mentioned in relation to the middoth of God and even then th e reference is only casual. 47 Jewish Kabbalah may have similarities with various forms of Gnosticism but there are also many differences. The G nostics viewed creation as the depraved   41 Scholem also spends a great deal of Origins of the Kaballah developing the connection between the gnostic concept of Sophia and the Kabbalistic equivalent, Hokmah (wisdom). Since this is not a thesis on gnostic influence on Jewish Kabbalah we will only analyse the connection between the aeons and the sefirot to further penetrate the nature of the sefirot . 42 Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , 84-85. 43 This separation is not unique to Kabbalah and can be found in older material. See Scholem: Origins of the Kaballah , 124. 44 Proverbs 3:19 “The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.” Proverbs 3:20 “By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.” Emphasis added. 45 Synonymous here with the Gnostic Sophia . 46 Synonymous in this context with the Gnostic concept of gnosis . 47 Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , 124."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 49 production of a renegade creator god. Jewish Kabbalah, especially the later Hasidic (18 th C) interpretation 48 and the writings of R. Abraham Abulafia (b.1240 C.E.) 49 emphasises the sanctity of the created world. Later we will see this theme evident in the concept of the Shekhinah . According to Scholem, the “orthodox” Kabbalistic speculation was concerned with overcoming anti-cosmic dualism. 50 While the Gnostics viewed the creator (and thus creation) as removed from the true Hidde n God, the Kabbalists looked towards the emanations of the Hidden God in creation. The seven lower sefirot are known by various titles. The number seven plays an important part in Judaism. The seven days of creation, the seven voices with which the Torah was given, the seven voices of Psalm 29, and so forth. 51 Perhaps the most interesting application of the number seven is in relation to the limbs of a man; the two arms, two legs, head, phallus, and wife (as an expression of completion). The same symbolism would be similar for a woman thou gh the symbolism is not as overt. This microcosmic connection with the seven lower sefirot is also evident in the macrocosmic symbolism of the Adam Kadmon as found in the Sefer ha-Zohar . 52 The connection between the individual and the Adam Kadmon , which is in turn a connection to the unmanifest divinity, gives th e pious individual a direct link to the divine realms.

One of the ways the Kabbalists viewed the connection between divi nity and the material world was through the concept of the Shekhinah . The Shekhinah and the Sefirot Originally the term Shekhinah referred to any point in the Bible where God’s presence is manifest among the children of Israel. 54 The term was later applied to the idea of divine inspiration in much the same contex t as the Christian Holy Spirit is understood. In the context of Kabbalah and the Bahir , the Shekhinah is the feminine side of God. This feminine aspect of God is also attributed to the final, i.e. the most manifest, sefira Malkut . 55 The Shekhinah is used intercha ngeably throughout the Bahir with the terms: “the bride”, “the daughter” or “the king’s daughter”, and the ecclesia of Israel. 56 There is also a connection with biblical symbol s such as the moon, the earth, the ethrog, 57 “the fruit of beautiful trees” in the festive bouquet (Lev. 23:40), and the date (as a symbol of the vagina). 58 Nowhere prior to the Bahir is the Shekhinah described as feminine or equated interchangeably w ith the aforementioned synonyms. There is a sense of intimacy with the Shekhinah . While the sefirot are usually approached through meditative intellectual practices, primar ily due to their abstract   53 The infinite and unknown God of the Kabbalists is known as En Soph (limitlessness).

Though perhaps an irreverent comparison, there are similarities in the Catholic notion of the Trinity and its relation to Mary. What appears to be a ment al exercise in philosophical contemplation (i.e. the Trinity) is made “real” or manifest in the Marian attributes of love, compassion, and sorrow. The many devotees of Mary and the ex cathedra statement made by Pius XII seem to indicate that there is a common need for a personal and an emotionally tangible connection to divinity. 59 To summarise, the Sefer Bahir was the first truly Kabbalistic text. The text has no single author and is comprised of various influences from within Judaism and from external sources such as Gnosticism. The Bahir is the first attempt to crystallise the highly malleable Kabbalistic philo sophy. Also unique to the Bahir , is the equation of the Shekhinah with “feminine” aspects of divinity. Biblical references to the aforementioned symbols now take on an entirely different meaning—a meaning that indicates a direct connection between humans (esp ecially the Children of Israel), the natural world (as divine creation) and divinity. One last Jewish Kabbalistic concept related to the sefirot should be reviewed, namely, the En-Sof . Isaac the Blind and the En-Sof We find that the modern understanding of the sefirot started to develop with the teachings of Isaac the Blind (circa. 1160-1236). In Isaac’s commentary on the Sefer Yetsirah (4:3), 1 Chronicles 29:11 is used for the first time in Kabbalistic literature as a biblical source for the name and order of the lower seven sefirot . Though Isaac places   59 For a Jungian reading on this issue see: John P.

Through Isaac and his contemporaries we see th e addition of Neoplatonic concepts to the early Gnostic and Jewish mystical concepts. Isaac “postulates three stages in the my stery of the deity and its unfolding in creation and revelation. They are ca lled in his works the Infinite ( ‘En-Sof ), Thought and Speech.” 61 The term En-Sof is the transcendent, ultimate nature of God. The sefirot ( middoth ), “Yahweh”, or any biblical account of God does not exhaust the nature of En- Sof . Anything that is stated rationally about God is not God. En-Sof is divinity beyond rationality. The God of the Torah is not really God. The God of the Torah is a symbol, an imprint, or a reflection of a God that is beyond description and characterisation. Obviously there is a myriad of other important developments within Jewish Kabbalah and its understanding of the sefirot . However, for the purposes of this chapter we will turn to Sefer ha-Zohar or Book of Splendour and end with the contributions of Joseph Gikatilla, Moses Cordovero, and Is aac Luria to the development of the sefirot . The Zohar Read almost any work on the history of Jewish Kabbalah and the Zohar will be cited as the most important or infl uential Kabbalistic text. 62 Nearly every Kabbalist who appeared after the dissemination of the Zohar used it extensively, if not exclusively. The Sefer Yetsirah and Bahir are still important but they ar e usually approached through the   60 Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , 263. 61 Scholem, Origins of the Kaballah , 265. 62 Circa 1286.

Like the other two works, the Zohar deals with mystical interpretations of biblical passages. The Zohar : is composed as a commentary on the Five Books of Moses, and this and several other additions c ontain theosophical discourses on such topics as the hidden and mani fest nature of God; the process of creation; the Sefirot (which the Zohar calls by an abundance of other names); the nature of good and evil; the masculine and feminine aspects of the divine; the nature of death, sleep, and dreams; and the essence of the human soul. 63 Also like the Yetsirah and the Bahir , the Zohar is not systematised nor is it as seminal in relation to the development of the sefirot as it might first appear. The Zohar expands on the themes of both the Bahir and the Yetsirah as the Bahir builds on the Yetsirah . From the perspective of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar is an important document; its influence has also been felt in Christian, Hermetic and Western Esoteric Traditions through various Latin translations. 64 Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla and the Gates of Light A disciple of Abulafia (1240-1290), Gi katilla’s (1248-1305) most important contribution to Kabbalah and the development of the sefirot was his book Sha’are Orah or Book of Light . 65 The Sha’are Orah “is an encyclopaedia of God’s Names as well as a map which reveals the connect ions between the words in the Torah and the names of God. Like a scriptural cryptogra pher, Gikatilla strips away the outer laye rs of meaning in   63 Sanford Drob, Kabbalistic Metaphors: Jewish Mystical Themes in Ancient and Modern Thought (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson Inc., 2000), 10. 64 The first Latin translation was “the renowned Frenchman Guillaume Postel (1510-1581), one of the outstanding personalities of the Renaissance.

Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for example, are more than Patriarchs; they actuall y represent different attributes of the Holy One Himself.” 66 The Sha’are Orah offers “a systematic, clear, detailed work which departs from the opaque a nd homiletic style of the Book of Splendour ( Zohar ).... In contrast, Gikatilla wants the Kabbalah of Gates of Light to be clearly understood.” 67 The Sha’are Orah differs from other Kabbalistic te xts in that its commentaries on the sefirot follow an ascending ( Malkut to Kether ), as opposed to a descending ( Kether to Malkut ), order. Moshe Idel tells us in the introduction to the Gates of Light that Gikatilla does not explain this approach but that his te acher, Abulafia used the ascending approach at least once. 68 Idel offers his own interpretation of the ascending path: Whereas the emanative process of Creation by stages of descent from the Infinite is the centr al concern of the theosophical Kabbalists, the mystic’s return is the focus of the ecstatic Kabbalist. Indeed, the latter states that the mystic, namely the “receiver of the Names of the Sefirot, should make an effort to receive the Divine everflow [sic ] from them, in accordance with his attributes. And he should cleave to each Sefirah and Sefirah separately and he should integrate his cleaving with all the Sefirot together, and will not separate the branches” 69 As Idel has indicated, the Sha’are Orah clarified the style and approach to understanding the sefirot (through the Divine Names) and adopted an ascending direction to the sefirot . Rather than looking at the sefirot as part of the creation of existence, Gikatilla analysed their role in the mystical experience.   66 Gikatilla, Gates of Light , xvii. 67 Gikatilla, Gates of Light , xvii. 68 Gikatilla, Gates of Light , xxvii. 69 Gikatilla, Gates of Light , xxviii."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 55 Moses Cordovero and Isaac Luria Moses Cordovero (1522-1570) helped es tablish a standard order of the sefirot and the theory that each sefirot contains every other one. In this way the apparent hierarchy present in the ordering of the sefirot is not as rigid. Also, ever ything that exists exists due to a blending of the sefirot and since the sefirot are middoth of God’s essence and humans are made in God’s image then all humans are encouraged to develop the sefirotic traits within themselves. 70 Finally, we turn to Isaac Luria (1534-1572) . Luria contributed very interesting concepts to the development of the sefirot . Luria viewed creation as a negative act, an act of contraction ( tzimtzum ). If God is all, everything, limitless ( En-Sof ) then how does the universe exist? This would lead to a non-m onotheistic or panentheis tic view that this world and every other world w ould be God. Luria posited th at God created existence by leaving a void (space) into which God then em anated an infinite collection of worlds and beings to dwell on them. The first of these beings was the Adam Kadmon or Primordial Man. The sefirot emanated from the head of Adam Kadmon as light. The light returned leaving residual vessels and a second light filled the vessels creating the sefirot : Table Two: The Sefirot Kether: Hokmah: Binah:  --Da’at -- Hesed: Geburah: Tiferet: Netzach: Crown or Ratzon (Will) Wisdom Understanding Knowledge (not always included) Loving Kindness Strength or Din (Judgment) Beauty or Rachamim (Compassion) Glory   70 Drob, Kabbalistic Metaphors , 10."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 56 Hod: Yesod: Malkut: Splendour Foundation Kingdom This combination and arrangement of the sefirot is often referred to as the Tree of Life as it has its roots in the Divine World while its bran ches stretch into the mundane. 71 In Luria’s cosmology, the vessels were unable to contain the divine light and as a result the lower seven sefirot shattered (s hevirah ) and the upper three sefirot were displaced. The goal of any pious Jew, according to this doctrine, is the restoration ( tikkun ) of the divine order of the sefirot . 72 This restoration depends on every action, every thought of the individual. Only by repairing the broken vessels within can the universal vessels be mended. Summary of Jewish Kabbalah This has been a very cursory review of some of the ways the concept of the sefirot has developed in Jewish Kabbalah. Only those applications that are used in other, non- Jewish Kabbalistic traditions were reviewed. Jewish Kabbalah is a complicated tradition but despite this innate complexity, there is a simple concept at its root: order. Jewish Kabbalah attempts to explain how a monotheis tic, transcendent deity can have meaning in the mundane world. The tradition also atte mpts to breathe life into ancient texts and rituals; it attempts to label, to identify and define the unknown. However, Judaism has not been the only religion to embrace Kabbalah and the sefirot .

The Jewish Kabbalah demonstrated the power of the Hebrew alphabet, the importance of the Torah , and the need for universal restitution. Christian Kabbalah found in Jewish Kabbalah support for the doctrine of the Trinity, an objective verifi cation of the reality of the Christ, and a paradigm for the exploration (one could ar gue exploitation) of the natural world. Some historically significant figures in Christian Kabbalah were Flavious Mithridates (15 th C) 74 , Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494), Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522) 75 , and Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-1689). 76 In many ways Pico was to Christian Kabbalah what the Sefer Bahir was to Jewish Kabbalah. Each laid a foundation that would be copi ed, commented, and elaborated on by later Kabbalists.

Scholem refers to Mithrindates as Guiglelmus Raimundus Moncada and states that his Latin translation of the Bahir , made for Pico, is the oldest in existence (Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah , 49n). 75 Reuchlin produced the first systematic description of Christian Kabbalah ( De arte cabalistica ) and was well informed with emanational ( sefirot ), number and letter symbolism, and ecstatic currents of Kabbalah.

The beliefs of Christianity and Judaism, while in agreement on some areas of cosmology, are independent and unique traditions (despite the use of the term “Judeo-Christian”). As with all the forms of Kabbalah mentioned in this chapter, there are similarities between the traditions yet each is unique in its use of Kabbalah and should be re spected as an inde pendent tradition. The sefirot in Pico’s thought are employed in mu ch the same way as they were in early Jewish Kabbalah. 78 The sefirot are still seen as qualities and they are connected to the natural world and the soul. 79 Yates gives an analysis and summary of Pico’s use of the sefirot . She relates that there is a connecti on between the Ten Sphe res of the Cosmos, the seven spheres of the planets, the eighth s phere of the firmament and fixed stars, the empyrean, the Primum Mobile , and the ten sefirot . 80 The following table gives the celestial equivalent to the sefirot :   77 In his Oration , Pico states that he found in the Jewish Kabbalistic tradition “not so much the Mosaic as the Christian religion.

In many ways this division is difficult as there are cases where the two are intimately entwined. However, the “practical” Kabbalah would play a major role in the Kabbalistic writings of Hermetic and Western Esoteric Kabbalah. Another fundamental figure in the deve lopment of Christian Kabbalah, and an individual who would act as a major Kabba listic source for Carl Jung, was Knorr von Rosenroth.

The Supernal Triad of Kether , Hokmah , and Binah could be as easily applied to the unmanifest En-Sof of Jewish Kabbalah, as it could to the Christian Trinitarian godhead. The contribution of most of the Christian Kabbalists, in relation to the sefirot , lies in their translations of Jewish Kabbalistic texts and their interpretations of those translations. Summary of Christian Kabbalah In the section on Jewish Kabbalah we saw how the sefirot were used as intellectual and qualitative constructs. They represented attributes of an ultimately unknowable deity. They also functioned as a link to the Torah and thus to all of Jewish life and the Jewish world-view. In many ways the sefirot of Christian Kabbalah function in the same way as their Jewish predecessors. The Christian sefirot look to the New Testament as well as to the Torah to find meaning and universal order. Christian Kabbalists like Pico were ab le to find support for the Christian mysteries such as the Trinit arian nature of God. One no ticeable trait of Christian Kabbalah is its ability to adapt a distinctly Jewi sh mystical tradition to suit its own views. As mentioned above, this attitude is importa nt to understand the nature of Kabbalah. How is it possible that a mystical tradition that is uniquely Jewish (w ith its connection to   83 For example, S.L.

One interpretation of Kabbalah that existed alongside Christ ian Kabbalah was Hermetic Kabbalah.

Beitchman states that this thread of Kabbalah is one that is: God-Angel-and-Demon conjuring and connects more-or-less ancient Hermeticism, [and] is spawned in Italy just about the same time as Pico’s Christian one. Th is bold movement ... cuts through millennia of monotheism, refusing its limits, modesty, and restrictions, back to its Pagan provenance. . . 86 The most obvious difference between this form of Kabbalah and the previous two is the emphasis on practical Kabbalah and magic. Jewish and Christian Kabbalah each had sub-streams of practical Kabbalah but they were marginal. In Hermetic and Western Esoteric Kabbalah this practic al perspective takes to the foreground.

Agrippa’s most well known work is de occulta philosophia . De occulta philosophia (printed in 1533 and written when he was 23) is divided into three books: Natural Magic, Celestial Magic, and Ceremonial Magic. The work cites heavily the Corpus Hermeticum and Hermetic philosophical concep ts. As indicated by the titles of the books, de occulta philosophia is concerned with “this worl dly” concepts. Or rather, it is concerned with a unique view of the world that did not se parate the quest to understand the natural world from that of the divine world. During the Renaissance science, religion, and magic had a unique bond. According to de León-J ones the following beliefs prevailed during the Renaissance: 1. Magic is the equivalent of scie nce, because both explore the very structure of the universe. 2. Magic is also the equivalent of religion, because it provides a cosmology and reveals God in the universe and humankind’s ability to communicate with deity. 3. Magic is thus the equivalent of both religion and science, because the combination reveals the mysteries of the universe and of the divine. 88 Agrippa’s work demonstrates a drive to rend the veil of mystery surrounding the natural world. By revealing th e secrets of the natural world, the divine realms are also revealed, for as the Hermetic Em erald Tablet states: “that which is above is as that which is below.”   87 Yates displays a remarkable dislike of Agrippa throughout Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition . Whatever one’s view of Agrippa, his is still a fundamental name in Hermetic and Western Esoteric Kabbalah. 88 Karen Silvia de León-Jones, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997), 9."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 63 Giordano Bruno was a radical th inker in nearly every re spect. In fact Bruno was radical enough to be burned at the stake by the Inquisition in 1600. 89 Frances Yates labelled Bruno a Hermetic magus; however, this is not the sole interpretation of Bruno and his relationship with mysticism. In her book Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah: Prophets, Magicians, and Rabbis , Karen Silvia de León-Jone s presents the hypothesis that Bruno was actually more a Kabbalist than a Hermeticist. From the perspective of a Bruno biography this assumption may be a minor point but from a perspective of the development of the sefirot Bruno’s role as a Kabbalist is important. Like Agrippa before him, Bruno was fasc inated with magic. According to de León-Jones Kabbalistic ideas are “most pr evalent in Bruno’s cosmological ordering because he found them compatible with Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean doctrine.” 90 Bruno found in the Kabbalah of Pico and Agrippa (as well as others) attributes that he incorporated into his theories. Ideas such as negative creation 91 , the idea of moving from the mundane world toward the divine, and the coincidentia oppositorum , etc., are all present in Bruno’s works. Br uno also saw that there wa s a deep connection between Kabbalah, theology, and philosophy. De León-J ones gives an English translation (from the Italian) of a passage from Bruno’s Cabala : Here then is Cabala, theology and philosophy: I mean a Cabala of theological philosophy, a philoso phy of Cabalistic theology, a theology of Cabalistic philosophy , such that I am uncertain whether you have these three as eith er as an entity, or in parts, or as nothing; however, I am quite certain that you have in part all of   89 Bruno’s charges included Ariansim [i.e., denying the full divinity of Christ], iconoclasm and possession of heretical books (specifically Erasmus). de Leon-Jones, Giodarno Bruno and the Kabbalah , 1. 90 de León-Jones, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , 15. 91 That is to say the Kabbalistic notion of tzimtzum where God contracts himself and creates a void in order that he may create existence."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 64 nothing, part of everything in nothing, and not any part of everything. 92 Kabbalah was a tool of remarkable versatility for Bruno. His primary interest was in the hermeneutic techniques that Kabbalah offe red. Bruno’s interest in Kabbalah also influenced his mysticism and prophecy. However, we will limit our brief investigation to his use of the sefirot as a vehicle of order and structure. Bruno did not overtly posit an original theory about the sefirot . However, he does present the sefirot in a direct manner that reflects his philosophy. 93 Bruno followed the standard sefirot order and refers to the sefirot as dimensioni . By referring to the sefirot as dimensions we see that Bruno is applying Kabb alah as a form of universal structure, a structure that bridges both science and mysticism. To cite de León-Jones: Dimensions signify the terms used to define a concept of thing; the inherent qualities that make up its essence...To call the sefirot “dimensioni” underscores that they represent the “dimensions” of God and hence are equivale nt to the Names of God. 94 Like the Sefer Yetsirah , Bruno also analyses the dimensions or “measurements” of God. The sefirot had another important function for Bruno. The sefirot have a history of being used as a means to meditate upon and contemplate abstract concepts. Whether En- Sof , the Trinity, or the First Cause, the sefirot pointed to, and imbued with quality, that which transcends definition. The sefirot also functioned as mnemonic tools. Bruno found the sefirot , in their Tree of Life configuration, to be exceptional devices not only to understand the divine and natural worlds but also to understand the microcosmic structure of memory and images. These images, in turn, help to penetrate the depths of the divine world by providing a vehicle, or, perhaps mo re accurately, a language through which the   92 de León-Jones, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , 24. 93 de León-Jones, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , 35. 94 de León-Jones, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , 37."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 65 divine world may be experi enced.

Summary of Hermetic Kabbalah This section on Hermetic Kabbalah brings to the fore two important influences that would pass onto Western Esoteric Kabbalah. Both the emphasis on magic, that is to say the practical application of theoretica l/intellectual cosmological theories and the centrality of symbols and images. Both of th ese influences play a major role in Western Esoteric Kabbalah. To rephrase, we moved from the abstract pre-Kabbalistic Sefer Yetsirah where the sefirot are abstractions of divinity to Jewish Kabbalah, which is rooted in the Jewish cosmology and scripture. In Christian Kabbala h we see a shift to a different cosmology, one that looked towards the Christ concept and the Trinity while embracing Neoplatonic philosophies. 95 Hermetic Kabbalah reflects the inte llectual and spiritual movements of the Renaissance. With its emphasis on magi c (as both science and religion) and memory, there is a pronounced practicality in Hermetic Kabbalah. The natural world is a link to the divine world and Kabbalah and the sefirot provide an interpreti ve tool or structure through which one can come to understand the secrets of nature. The Western Esoteric Tradition’s interpretation of Kabbalah continues to blend, merge, and adapt Kabbalistic concepts including the sefirot .   95 Neoplatonic thought was not completely absent fro m Jewish Kabbalah, what is being highlighted are general areas of though t.

Following the influence of Agri ppa, the Western Esoteric use of Kabbalah and the sefirot is highly pragmatic. There are indeed philosophical abstractions related to the sefirot in Western Esoteric Kabbalah. However, the emphasis is, in some cases, on the specif ic function and effect of the sefirot on the individual psyche. Dion Fortune, one of the most importan t figures in Western Esoteric Kabbalah, refers to the Western Esoteric Tradition 97 as the Yoga of the West. 98 In this context the Western Esoteric Tradition should be understo od as being comprise d of mental, physical, and emotional practices. One of the common symbols that bridge many of the branches of the Western Esoteric Tradition, and each of the aforementioned traditions within this chapter, is the Tree of Life and one way the sefirot are seen within the Western Esoteric Tradition is as representative of an ongoing initiatory process. This initiato ry process is also reflected in one of the traditi on’s most familiar tools: the Tarot. 99   96 Aleister Crowley, Magick Without Tears (Arizona: New Falcon, 1994), 14. 97 Fortune actually uses the term “Western Mystery Tradition.” 98 See: Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (York Beach: We iser, 1991). 99 In this context, Tarot is far more than a card game or form of cartomancy. The Tarot in the context of the Western Esoteric Tradition refers to a deck of 78 cards that is divided into two parts. The first part is called the “Major Arcana” and is comprised of twenty-two cards from 0 (The Fool) to XXI (The World/Universe). The second part, the “Minor Arcana” is composed of numbered cards (1-10) and court cards (Prince/Page, Knight, Queen, King-or some similar arrangement). The Fool (0) is seen as the aspirant who must pass through many initiations on his/her spiritual journey throughout their life. The actual history of the Tarot (tenuous as it is) is not important in this context. What is important is how the Western Esoteric Tradition tends to use the Tarot (as the Book of Thoth/Hermes) in relation to the sefirot ."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 67 Lévi, the Sefirot and the Tarot The most influential person within the Western Esoteric Tradition to popularise the connection between the Tarot and the sefirot (through the sefirot’s connection with the Hebrew alphabet) and the Tree of Life was Eliphas Lévi (1810-1875). 100 Lévi applied the twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana (T rumps 0 to XXI) to the Twenty-Two paths of the Tree of Life that connect the sefirot . The remaining ten paths, i.e. the sefirot themselves, corresponded to the numbered cards and court cards. 101 For example, Binah, the third sefira , corresponds to the four Threes, the four Queens, and all Cups. The connecting paths leading to Binah from Hokmah , Kether , and Tiferet correspond to The Empress (III), The Magus (I), and The Lovers (VI) respectively. 102 In this way, the esoteric meanings or themes of the specific cards are reflected in the sefirot and the connecting paths. Like Bruno’s use of the sefirot as a complement to his mysticism and a mnemonic tool, the sefirot and the Tarot of the Western Esoteric Tradition function as a mnemonic device that supports and amplifies its esoteric symbolism and world-view. The Tarot can be used as the focus of a practice called “pat hworking”. One way of describing pathworking is that it is similar to Jung’s understanding of active imagination. One would visualise the card as a large landscape or as a door. Then one places oneself into the scene and interacts w ith the personalities th at dwell “within” the card. With a thorough knowledge of Esoteric sy mbolism this type of practice is assumed   100 Lévi was not the first to write on the subject of a connection between Tarot and the Hebrew alphabet. The Comte de Mellet wrote a short article on the tarot in Court de Gébelin's Le Monde Primitif (1781). Lévi’s Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum is an introduction to the connection between Tarot and Kabbalah. 101 The four suits of the Minor Arcana are: Swords (Air-Intellect), Wands (Fire-Will), Cups (Water- Emotion), and Disks or Pentacles (Earth-Body). 102 These particular correspondences are taken from Aleister Crowley, et al ., Magick: Liber Aba (Parts I- IV) (York Beach, ME: Weiser, 1997), 547.

In active imagination the unconscious is encouraged to enter into consciousness unhindered by an imposed structure (other than the emotion, dream or complex bei ng dealt with at the time). Pathworking imposes a structure, in our example the structure is the Tree of Life, but the experiences on the Tree would be of an individual and subjective nature. Tarot is not the only way the sefirot are used within the Western Esoteric Tradition; the sefirot and the Tree of Life are also used as a “cosmic filing cab inet” of universal correspondences. 103 Aleister Crowley and Liber 777 While there are Western Esotericists who practice as solitary practitioners, there are also many that are members of various Esoteric Orders. 104 These Orders vary in approach and teachings but the majority use the sefirot and the Tree of Life in their training. One important Order that used the sefirot in their training was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn was (or is if we are to accept th e claims by some modern Orders to be of an unbroken lineage to the original Order) an Order that based Masonically inspired initiations on the sefirot and the Tree of Life .

Some lessons and tests were intellectual, some were ritual, and still others were emotional/devotional. At the base of all the lessons were the sefirot . One practice employed by the Golden Dawn and other similar Orders was to compile a list of correspondences that applied to each of the sefirot . By doing this, the initiate deve loped a personal an d unique relation with the sefirot . Aleister Crowley, a one time member of the Golden Dawn, intentionally broke his vows of secrecy and published a grea t deal of the Golden Dawn’s rituals and teachings. His reasons for publishing the ma terial were numerous and by doing so he opened the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Trad ition to a larger audience. 105 In 1909, Crowley published a list of co rrespondences in his book entitled Liber 777 .

While Freud and Jung were debating the structure of the psyche, the Esot ericists were undert aking their own foray into the depths of human psychological experience. Given their similar chronological and thematic undertakings we would expect to see some connection or inter-penetration between psychology and the Western Esoteric Tr adition. In fact, th e connection was very much one-sided. Neither Freud nor Jung had much time for Esoteric traditions or their teachings. However, the same cannot be said for the Western Esoteric Tradition. Crowley, the least “qualified” psychologist of the four Esotericists discussed in this chapter, stated that th e Magical Tradition and the Holy Qabalah were “the Children’s table from which Freud... at e a few crumbs that fell.” 109 Of Jung, Crowley states “...we should all study Jung. His final conclusions ar e in the main correct, even if his rough working is a bit sketchy; and we’ve got to st udy him, whether we like it or not, for he will soon be recognized as the undoubted Autocrat of the 1917 dinner-table.” 110 Crowley respected both Freud and Jung, at least to some degree, but it was Regardie and Fortune who actively engaged in the ps ychology/esoteric connection.

Fortune’s most important contribution to the Western Esoteric Tradit ion’s understanding of the sefirot comes from her work The Mystical Qabalah . Fortune does not imply that her work reflects an unbroken lineage from Jewish Kabbalah rather that the Kabbalistic interpretations of the Western Esoteric Tradition are legitimate descendants. 112 Fortune, like Bruno, saw that Kabbalah and its components brought together various forms of human inquiry. Fortune states that the Tree of Life “is a compendium of science, psychology, philosophy, and theology.” 113 The Mystical Qabalah goes into great depth in analysing the nature of the sefirot as understood from w ithin the Tradition. However, unlike the writings of Luria, Pico, or Bruno names and terms like Freud, transcendental psychology, psychoanalysts, superconsciousness, dream-analysis, analytical psychology, and subconscious mi nd are used in tandem with the already familiar Kabbalistic terminology. The sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tradition now began to be linked with the ps yche. Along with Fortune, Isr ael Regardie also linked the meaning of the sefirot in the Western Esoteric Tradition with psychology. Israel Regardie, like Crowley and Fortune before him, followed in the traditions of the Golden Dawn. Also like Fortune, Regardie found that psychology and the Western Esoteric Tradition had many common points. Psychologists such as Wilhelm Reich, Freud and Jung greatly influenced Regardie. 114 Along with psychology, the practice and   111 One of Fortune’s public lectures to the London Sc hool of Medicine was published under the title “The Machinery of the Mind.” 112 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 2, 20. 113 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 13. 114 Regardie studied psychotherapy under Dr. Nandor Fodor, Dr. E.

Knight, as with Fortune and Regardie, us es psychology (primarily “Jungian”) to help clarify the nature of the Tree of Life and the sefirot yet also like Fortune and Regardie, Knight sees that the methodologies and models of psychology are too limiting and too narrow. However, the terms and theo ries of psychology are still to be found within Knight’s A Practical Guide : Students familiar with Jungian psychology can get some conception of their [i.e., the four elements] application by considering the four Jungian psychological functions of intuition, feeling, intellect, and sensation, wh ich corresponds to Air, Water, Fire, and Earth and which on the lower Sephiroth of the Tree can be equated with Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Malkut. 121 The equation of the sefirot with the human body by Je wish Kabbalah brought the sefirot into an intimate connection with the i ndividual. Here we see an even more intimate connection between the individual and the sefirot via the psyche. In the Western Esoteric Tradition we see that the psyche and the sefirot are connected. The sefirot and the Tree of Life act as a te mplate through which one ca n study and experience the psyche. Instead of speaking of th e self, the Esoterisist speaks of Tiferet . Instead of using the term “shadow”, th e lunar qualities of Yesod or perhaps the discarde d dark shells of the sefirot , the qlippoth , could be used. 122   121 Knight, Practical Guide , 72-73. 122 There is no standardisation in how the sefirot can be applied to the psyche (or in this case the model of the psyche employed by analytical psychology). Personal insights and understanding are at the root of the application of the sefirot to other constructs of order."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 75 The equalising nature of the self can be objectified and meditated upon through the myriad of symbols that correspond to the Western Esoteric interpretation of Tiferet . The paths surrounding the sefirot afford the Esotericist various angles of approach. Each of the connecting paths on the Tree of Life is a combination of the two sefirot that it, the path, connects. Tiferet can be approached through intellect ( Hod ), through emotion ( Netzach ), through the rigid Martian strength of “hard love” ( Geburah ), through loving kindness ( Hesed ) or via a “mystical” experience of unity ( Kether ). The approach toward Tiferet would depend on one’s psychological dispos ition. If one is lacking in self- discipline one could me ditate and experience Tiferet via Geburah . By focusing on the Martian qualities of the sefira 123 the Esotericist develops a rapport with those attributes in his or her psyche. In the case of a negati ve anima/animus (perhaps an imbalance in Tiferet ) the strength needed to confront the i ssue could be gained through this type of cultivation. Not all Esotericists would agree with this approach. A psychologically minded practitioner will evoke (call fo rward) a “demon”, “angel”, or “entity”, for example, understanding that the image being formulated in the imagination (usually in some form or degree of altered state of consciousness ) is a representation or metaphor of their unconscious or portion thereof. There are some practitioners who see such an undertaking as entirely objective. The evoke d demons are real and separate from the individual. Still, others posit a middle ground. Even if the demons are “just in the mind”, the mind has a great influence on the body so what is real for the mind, is real for the body.

The sefirot function as a means of arranging and of ordering the universe. However, aside from attempting to penetrate the mysteries of the natural world, the individuals within the Western Esoteric Tradition 125 look also to the depths of the psyche for meaning. Yet there is still more to the Western Esoteric wo rld-view than the psyche. According to the Tradition, both the natural world and the “i nner realms” of the mind have a greater complexity than is generally accounted for. 126 While other interpretations of Kabbalah incorporated an unde rstanding of thought and of the mind, the Western Esoteric Tr adition, as understood in our current understanding of the Tradition, was in its early stages of development during a period when the psychologies of Freud and Jung we re becoming established. This parallel growth meant that the Western Esoteric Tradition found in analyt ical psychology and psychoanalysis a different vocabul ary to describe the very process they adapted from the Judaic, Christian, and Hermetic Kabbalah.   124 Lon Milo Duquette, The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford , (York Beach, MN: Weiser Books, 2001), 99. 125 Or at least the individuals listed in this thesis. 126 The Western Esoteric Tradition also attempts to understand what Jung termed synchronicity. Various practices such as gematria (i.e. the substitution of letters for numbers in a word where the resulting number corresponds to any other word with the same numeration) or divination practice help the practitioner find acausal patterns in their environment. Of course, this is an imposed “Jungian” interpretation of esoteric practices.

If the sefirot are the building blocks or archetype s of existence then they should be evident throughout the universe. The responsibility is on the individual to cultivate his or her personal connection to the sefirot and to understand how the sefirot interplay within one’s interiority and daily life. One major difference between the Western Esoteric Tradition’s interpretation of Kabbalah and the sefirot and the other traditions, is the l ack of a central text. Judaism has not only the Torah , but also a diverse collection of Kabbalistic works and treaties; Christian Kabbalah has the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament while the Corpus Hermeticum enriches Hermetic Kabbalah. However, the Western Esoteric Tradition, in general, has no central texts, at least in the conventional sense of the word yet thanks to individuals such as Lévi, the Book of Thoth (the Tarot) corresponds to the sefirot and the Tree of Life. 127 This book of symbolic images a nd transformations can be seen as providing an underlying structur e that is supplied in the ot her forms of Kabbalah through their specific scriptures. Conclusion to Chapter One We have seen that the sefirot are not unique to Jewish Kabbalah. Other traditions have found great wisdom in applying them, an d their implicit order, to a pre-existing world-view. However, sefirot do not create order or structure out of nothing. In each of the aforementioned interpretations of Kabbalah and the sefirot , there was a previously established world-view. The sefirot simply rearranged, restructured the world-view to   127 Though Christian oriented individuals or Orders w ill use the Bible and Esotericists such as Thelemites might employ Crowley’s “channeled” work, Liber AL vel Legis ."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 78 allow for a “fresh” or organic view. Herm etic Kabbalah, for example, could not have developed as it had were it not for the spiritual and intellectual currents of the Renaissance informing it and, in the contex t of philosophy and religion Renaissance thought was enriched by Kabbalistic concepts. The sefirot and the Tree of Life are symbols that become intimately entwined with the world-view that uses them. The re sult of that intimate connection is that the world-view is afforded a perspective whic h is open to metaphorical interpretations, patterns of interconnectedness and a more inclusive view of natu re and levels of reality. The downside of this inclusiveness is that not all applications of the sefirot are useful. At times the inclusiveness simply amplifies “n egative” attributes within the world-view, forming connections that constrict rather than expand perception and understanding as can be seen in the Christian Kabbalists, such as Pico, use of the sefirot to justify their own world-view over that of Judaism. One tradition that uses the Tree of Life and the sefirot that has not been mentioned is the “New Age” movement. Sin ce this thesis is not concerned with New Age spirituality, no analys is of this use of the sefirot will be conducted. Generally speaking the New Age Kabbalah is loosely ba sed on Jewish Kabbalah, without the need to be governed by the edicts of Judaism. Authors and Kabbalists such as Z’ev ben Shimon Halevi [Warren Kenton] 128 and Dr. Phillip S. Berg 129 are two examples of Kabbalists that fit, one could argue, mo re fully under the aegis of the New Age movement than Judaism.

Jung’s Understanding of the Sefirot"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 81 In order to better understand how Jung app lied Kabbalah in his writings we will review, in chronological order, various references to Kabbalah within the Collected Works . In “Analytical Psychology and ‘Weltanshauung’” 1 Jung discusses the German expression Weltanshauung ; a term he defines as “an att itude that has been formulated into concepts.” 2 The question Jung wishes to address is do “the findings of analytical psychology add something new to our Weltanschauung , or not?” 3 Our Weltanschauung , or loosely our view of the world, errs when we take names of things for the things themselves. 4 Jung juxtaposes the scientific me thod with examples of “unconscious primitivity”. 5 Whereas science deals with work ing hypotheses that can change (Jung gives the example that the scientist does not argue whether or not the name of the planet Neptune is the “right” name for it) the “pri mitive” or “old style” emphasises the true name and is therefore solidified. One example of this “old style” given by Jung was the idea that “[f]or the Cabalists the possession of the true name of God meant absolute magic power.” 6 Rather than look to the past or rely sole ly on the rational scientific pe rspective to find a new or vital world-view, i.e. Weltanschauung , analytical psychology can offer new possibilities to that end. For Jung analytical psychology is a means to utilise the tools of reason without losing the depth of the unconscious reflected in “primitive” thought: “Analytical psychology tries to resolve the resultant conflict not by going ‘back to Nature’ with Rousseau, but by holding on to the level of reason we have successfully   1 Jung, “Analytical Psychology and ‘Weltanschauung’”, CW 8 , pars. 689-748. 2 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 689. 3 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 701. 4 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 735. 5 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 736. 6 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 735."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 82 reached, and by enriching consciousness with a knowledge of man’s psychic foundations.” 7 Jung mentions Kabbalah in seve ral places within his notes on Dream Analysis . 8 During a seminar on June 26 th 1929, Jung discusses the book The Golem ( Der Golem ) by Gustav Meyrink. 9 This book is referen ced in several places th roughout the seminars and it is in this context that Kabbalah is discussed by Jung. 10 One important Kabbalistic notion raised in relation to The Golem , God as hermaphrodite, was suggested by Mrs. Alice Lewisohn Crowley 11 and commented on by Jung. 12 Though based on Kabbalistic lore, The Golem is not a Kabbalistic work. In “A Study in the Process of Individua tion” Jung refers to the “klippoth” or shards associated with the creation of the sefirot as found in Lurianic schools; he also cites Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala Denudata . 13 Further in the same work, Jung comments on the possible Kabbalistic influenc es on the works of Jacob Böhme. He acknowledges that while Böhme viewed Kabbala h as a form of magic, and presumably somewhat suspect, there are related themes in Kabbalah and Böhme such as the triplex notion of divinity (for example the Tetragrammaton while composed of four letters is actually only three with one repeated). 14 Finally, Jung amplifies a patient’s image by   7 Jung, “Weltanschauung”, CW 8 , par. 739. 8 Jung, Dream Analysis: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1928-1930 by C.G.

This particular use of Kabbalah is highlighted below when we analyse Wolfgang Pauli’s World Clock dream. A seco nd Kabbalistic reference is made in Psychology and Alchemy ( CW 12 ) in the paper “Religious Ideas in Al chemy”. The reference is a citation made by Jung regarding the Monad as being synonymous with the prima materia in alchemy. 17 The 1942 “Paracelsus as a Spiritual Phe nomenon” has references to various Christian Kabbalists who helped to bring Kabbalah into th e alchemical tradition; Jung cites figures such as Agrippa 18 and Pico della Mirandola 19 as sources for Paracelsus’ knowledge of Kabbalah, such as it was. 20 Specifically, Jung makes reference to commonalities between Kabbalah and alchemy: “Just as the wisdom of Cabala coincided with the Sapientia of alchemy, so the figur e of Adam Kadmon was identified with the filius philosophorum .” 21 We can see from this citation an example of Jung’s interest in the Kabbalah of Agrippa and Pi co and its relation to alchemy with the latter tradition being the more imperative influence on Jung’s thought.   15 Jung, “A Study in the Process of Individuation”, CW 9i , par. 588 n.136. 16 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 . 17 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 427 n.4 18 Jung, “Paracelsus as a Spiritual Phenomenon”, CW 13 , par. 152. 19 Jung, “Paracelsus as a Spiritual Phenomenon”, CW 13 , par. 167 & 173n. 20 Jung, “Paracelsus as a Spiritual Phenomenon”, CW 13 , par. 168. 21 Jung, “Paracelsus as a Spiritual Phenomenon”, CW 13 , par. 168."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 84 In “The Philosophical Tree” Jung comments on the image of the inverted tree ( arbour inversa ) being a common form of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. 22 Jung cites Blaise de Vigenère (Blasius Vigenerus) who he says “had some knowledge of the Cabala and is...comparing the philosophical tree with th e tree of the Sefiroth, which is actually a mystical world-tree. But for hi m this tree also signifies man.” 23 Here we see the linking of a macrocosmic Tree of Life with the microcosm of the human being. In the same paper Jung cites K norr von Rosenroth. Jung states: Knorr von Rosenroth is of the opinion that the “great tree” refers to Tifereth, the bridegroom of Malchuth. The upper Sefirah Binah is named the “root of the tree,” and in Binah is rooted the tree of life. Because this stood in the middle of the garden, it was called the linea media (middle line). Through th e middle line, which was as it were the trunk of the Sefiroth system, it brought life down to earth from Binah. 24 Aion reveals several Kabbalistic assertions made by Jung. In the chapter titled “Christ, A Symbol of the Self” Jung discusse s the dual nature of G od—that is to say God contains both good and evil. Jung refers to the Book of Job , the Bogomils 25 and Cathars 26 , and finally, “the two sides of the caba listic Tree of the Sephiroth, which were named hesed (love) and din (justice).” 27 For Jung, the Kabbalistic Tree of Life reflected the dual nature of the Biblical God: merciful and forgiving and at the same time stern and vengeful.

Of Böhme Jung writes: “In his writings we find a similar ambivalence, namely the love and the ‘w rath-fire’ of God, in which Lucifer burns for ever.” 28 Jung, while presenting these doctrinal and metaphysical assumptions clearly states that he is approaching these subjects fr om a psychological perspective. To Jung the idea of the privatio boni , an attitude he sees the Kabbalistic Tree countering, “is in a sense responsible for a too optimistic conception of the evil in human nature and for a too pessimistic view of the human soul.” 29 In a footnote corresponding to a citation by Hippolytus on the Monad or Son of Man, Jung refers to the connection between the Greek letter “ Iota ” ( ι ) and the Hebrew letter “ Yod ” ( י ). In both cases he states that the relationship of Iota to the self is the same as that of Yod to the lapis in Kabbalah 30 and, citing the Sha’are Kedusha , the “Original Man, Adam, signifies the littl e hook at the top of the letter Yod.” 31 Jung discusses the Kabbalis tic influences on alch emy saying that: “Jewish cabalism, made extremely interesting attemp ts, from the modern point of view, to synthesize a unitary vision of the world in which the physical and the mystical aspects played equal parts.” Jung c ontinues by stating that “[h]ad this attempt succeeded, we would not be witnessing today the curious sp ectacle of two parallel world-views neither of which knows, or wishes to know, anything about the other.” 32 Finally, Jung considers the unity of the anima and animus as representative of a coniunctio oppositorum and   28 Jung, Aion , CW 9ii , par. 111.

Later in “Answer to Job”, Jung again refers to the joining of “Yahweh” and Shekinah (as equivalent to Sophia). 36 Jung’s Magnus Opus, Mysterium Coniunctionis , presents an impressive and sustained use of Kabbalistic concepts; again, pr imarily in relation to alchemy. Jung again acknowledges a connection between Kabbalah a nd alchemy: “Directly or indirectly the Cabala was assimilated into alchemy.

The above citations are given as a genera l outline of Jung’s us e of Kabbalah. We see that he began writing about it, or at least mentioning it, in the late 1920’s and he continued to write about in his later works, culminating principally in Mysterium Coniunctionis . Clearly Kabbalah was an important tradition to Jung’s psychology. What follows is a more in-depth examination of some areas of Jung’s use of Kabbalah, especially in relation to the conjunction of alchemy. Jung incorporated aspects and theories found in religious and spiritual traditions into his understanding of psychology throughout hi s forays into the human psyche. Many arcane images and symbols reflected, in Jung’s mind, the process of psychological maturation, i.e. individuation . Jung found that there was historical evidence for his understanding of the psyche in esot eric traditions such as alchemy. 59 He claimed that the alchemists, lacking an “objective” understanding of the psyche and its processes, utilised symbolic imagery and arcane writings to record psychological transformations. With three entire volumes of the Collected Works dedicated to a psychologi cal interpretation of alchemy (and portions of several other volumes that demonstrate a similar influence) there is little doubt that this complex occult art was an important contribution to Jung’s model of the psyche. In MDR Jung recounts his understanding of the importance of alchemy in relation to psychology:   59 Jung’s interest in alchemy is well documented in his Memories, Dreams, Reflections (C.G. Jung.

The experiences of the alchemists were, in a sense, my experiences, and their world was my world. This was, of cour se, a momentous discovery: I had stumbled upon the historical count erpart of my psychology of the unconscious. The possibility of a comparison with alchemy, and the uninterrupted intellectual chain back to Gnosticism, gave substance to my psychology. 60 Jung’s Letters also reveal his depth of knowledge and interest in Kabbalah in the following piece of correspondence with analyst James Kirsch: ...I can call your attention to the extraordinary development in the Kabbalah. I am rather certain that the sefioth tree contains the whole symbolism of Jewish develo pment parallel to the Christian idea. The characteristic differenc e is that God’s incarnation is understood to be a historical fact in the Christian belief, while in Jewish Gnosis it is an entirely pleromatic process symbolized by the concentration of the supreme triad of Kether, Hokhmah, and Binah in the figure of Tifereth. Being the eq uivalent of the Son and the Holy Ghost, he is the sponsus bringing about the great solution through his union with Malkuth. 61 For Jung alchemy was not at odds with his psychology. Rather, this obscure tradition deepened and enriched his psychology. Related to alchemy, in depth and richness of meaning, is Kabbalah and the sefirot . Sanford Drob suggests, in his Kabbalistic Metaphors , that Kabbalah, rather than alchemy, is the more prevalent esoteric traditi on in Jung’s writings. Drob states that for every reference to the Kabbalah in Jung’s writings th ere are several to Gnosticism, and perhaps dozens to alchemy: yet the interpretations that Jung places on Gnosticism (itself a close cousin to the Kabbalah), and the very texts to which Jung refers to on alchemy, were profoundly kabbalistic, so much so that one could call the Jung of the Mysterium Coniunctionis and other later works, a Kabbalist in contemporary guise. 62   60 Jung, MDR , 205. 61 Jung, C.G.

However, as Jung did state that alchemy was clearly influenced by Kabbalah 63 the debate as to whether or not Jung was more influenced by alchemy or Kabbalah is somewhat unproductive. Ultimately the Kabbalah found in alchemy was not identical to the Kabbalah found in the Jewish tradition so by regarding Kabbalah and alchemy as separate influences on Jung, each with its own unique contribution, we can attempt to find connections between them. For the purpos e of this thesis we will look at how Jung specifically used and understood the Kabbalistic concept of the sefirot , as a metaphor of order, and how he applied this understanding to his model of the structure of the psyche. In essence the Kabbalists used the sefirot as a way to give order and meaning to the universe. Jung, with his focus on the mi crocosm of the human mind, applied the sefirot in a manner that amplifies the order and stru cture of the processes of the psyche. From a general perspective, Jung empl oyed five primary symbols of Kabbalah. Though separate, these five ar e actually interdependent: 1. The symbol of Adam Kadmon 2. The unification of opposites 3. The Divine Wedding 4. The scintillae (sparks) 64 5. Number symbolism 65 These five symbols or Kabbalistic constructs are actually examples of two more inclusive themes.

Jung, Alchemy and the Sefirot Jung viewed the symbolism of alchemy, especially the alchemy of the seventeenth century and later, as a repres entation of the processes of the unconscious pr ojected onto external objects. 66 Without knowing it, at least in the majority of the cases, the alchemists were recording the relationship between the unconscious and consciousness via their esoteric imagery. Their imagery was, in essence, reflecting the process of the union of opposites or, in the parlance of analytical psychology, the process of individuation. 67 Jung found that alchemy confirmed his understanding of psychology and he also found that the theories of Kabbalah (or at least those theories he was aware of at the time) echoed the alchemical world-view. Jung also noted that some figures within Jewish Kabbalah mirrored his psychology. For example, in “An Eightieth Birthday Interview” Jung is recorded as stating: “But do you know who anticipated my entire psychology in the eighteenth century? The Ha sidic Rabbi Baer from Meseritz, whom they called the Great Maggid. He was a most impressive man.” 68 Here we see that Kabbalah, along with alchemy, is cited by Jung as a hist orical precursor to his psychological theories.   66 Jung, “Religious Ideas in Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 394. 67 Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis , CW 14 , xvii. 68 William McGuire and R.F.C.

As we have seen in the Kabbalistic traditions discussed in Chapter One, the Tree and the sefirot represent a dynamic process that includes such cosmic moti on as contraction, breaking, creation, expansion, and c onjoining. The contraction, expansion, breaking and conjunction found with the Tree and the sefirot can also be applied to the processes and growth of the psyche. Adam Kadmon, the Divine Wedding and the Conjunction The Kabbalistic concepts of Adam Kadmon , the Divine Wedding, and the unification of opposites in the c onjunction, all imply a balance or ordering of existence. Each of these concepts helps to define, deepen, and focus the Kabbalistic cosmology. The Kabbalistic concepts undergo an interes ting transformation when Jung uses them to support his psychological world-view. As i ndicated in Chapter One, the Kabbalistic understanding of Adam Kadmon is a primordial archetypal image of order and of the microcosm and macrocosm brought into being from the En-Sof . Perhaps the most interesting role of the Adam Kadmon from the perspective of Jewish Kabbalah is that “he” simultaneously incorporates the vast ness of the universe   76 See “Answer to Job”, CW 11 par. 595n; Mysterium Coniunctionis , CW 14 pars. 18n, 19n, 557n, 592n, 594n, 610n, 625n, 634&n; Letters v.1 , 356n, 513n and v.2 , 92n, 359n. 77 Another possibility for this omission is Jung’s attempt to play down the Jewish nature of Kabbalah.

When Jung compared Adam Kadmon 79 to similar alchemical terms he viewed Adam Kadmon (and we could extend the comparison to the Kabbalistic Tree of Life as another symbolic representation of Adam Kadmon ) as a symbol parallel to the alchemist’s solve et coagula or the process of the sepa ration and union of opposites. 80 Adam Kadmon both divides and unifies through his partic ipation in the act of creation via the breaking of the vessels recounted in Kabbalistic cosmology and its eventual reintegration/restoration. As with alchemy, Jung also had a psychol ogical interpretation of Adam Kadmon and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Drob points out that Jung understood Adam Kadmon to be both the archetype of all psychological being 81 and an expressi on of the self. 82 Yet Adam Kadmon is not limited to being an expression of the self as he is also “the process of transformation.” 83 In alchemical symbolism Jung equates Adam Kadmon with Mercurius, 84 and the   78 There are obvious parallels between Adam Kadmon and the Ved ā nta notion of the Atman/Brahman ; there are similar parallels found with Purusha as presented in book 10 (90) of the Ŗ gveda (Jaroslav Pelikan, ed., Ralph T.

Adam Kadmon was the underlying order found throughout creation in Jewish Kabbalah and he becomes the same for the psyche and its coincidentia oppositorum . To get a clearer and more practical understanding of Adam Kadmon , as is the case with the self, it must be approach ed through more specific symbols or themes. One symbolic theme that reflects the nature of order underlying the sefirot is the Divine Wedding. The imagery of the Divine Wedding is not an uncommon one in Kabbalah. The sefirot often take on anthropomorphic roles in relation to one another. The imagery of incest is also common. At the root of this imagery is the theme of the union of opposites. 86 In MDR , Jung recounts a series of visions he ex perienced in his seventies. In one of these visions, he states: “I myself was, so it seemed, in the Pardes Rimmonim, the garden of pomegranates, and the wedding of Tifereth with Malchuth was taking place.” 87 This wedding of a “male” sefira ( Tiferet ) with a “female” sefira ( Malkut ) is similar in context to the Greek understanding of the hierosgamos , a sacred union, a fantasy that Jung had following the Kabbalistic vision. 88 This image was to play an important role in Jung’s interpretation of bot h alchemy and Kabbalah. The premise of the Divine Wedding is that there was an initial separation or a fall during the creation of the Universe. The purpose, in the case of Kabbalah, is to repair the separation, not to restore a Gold en Age of past unity but to create a new and unique state of harmony. This process is known in Kabbalah as tikkun . In alchemy the union of opposites is found throughout its sym bolism and reflects the same th eme.

The alchemical examples of the sacred union are not limited to these; the theme of separation and union is an integral component of the alchemical world-view. In Kabbalah, the divine dance of separation and union is portrayed by th e interconnectedness of the sefirot . Jung focused on six main sefirot when referring to the Divine Wedding or Union. 89 The sefirot Malkut , Yesod , Tiferet , and Kether (with the relationship between Malkut and Tiferet being cited most often) are the mo st prominently mentioned in Jung’s writings on the hiereosgamos in Kabbalah 90 ; however, the union of Hokmah and Binah is also mentioned in a similar manner. 91 Jung derived his knowledge of the sefirot from traditional Jewish or Christian Kabbalisitic sources. Also, as Scholem has attempted to demonstrate, the early or pre-Kabbalistic [i.e., Merkabah ] sources have Gnostic roots 92 , so these world-views, i.e., Judaism, Christianity and Gnosticism, exerted some influence on how Jung conceptualised Kabbalah. While he may have been inspired by conventional Kabbalistic sources, his analytical psychological interpretation of the sefirot is uniquely unconventional and it is to this innovative interpretation that we now turn.   89 There is no mention to Hod or Netzach in the Collected Works . Jung makes one reference to Hesed (Jung uses the alternate title Gedulah ) in CW 9i , A Study in the Process of Individuation , par. 588n, as being symbolised by the lion of Ezekiel’s vision; he makes two references to Geburah in A Study in the Process of Individuation , CW 9i , par. 588n where Jung equates Geburah with the bull of Ezekiel’s vision and in Mysterium Coniunctionis , CW 14 , par. 633n where Jung cites a passage from Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbalah denudata referring to the heat of the fire of Geburah and its connection to Tiferet . 90 Jung, “The Philosophical Tree”, CW 13, par. 411; Mysterium Coniunctionis , CW 14 , par. 18-19, 568. 91 Jung, “A Study in the Process of Individuation”, CW9i , par. 576 n.115 has Binah (as Tebhunah ) paired with “Ain-Soph” or Kether (as Senex Israel ); Mysterium Coniunctionis , CW 14 , par. 643n 92 Again, Scholem posits that the “historian of religion is entitled to consider the mysticism of the Merkabah [an early predecessor of medieval Kabbalah] to be one of the Jewish branches of Gnosticism. However rare the references in the extant texts to Gn ostic myths, or abstract speculations on the aeons and their mutual relationships, certain fundamental characteristics of Gnosticism are nevertheless fully congruent with the kind of mysticism we find in the Merkabah writings: the possession of a knowledge that cannot be acquired by ordinary intellectual means but only by way of a revelation and mystical illumination; the possession of a secret doctrine conc erning the order of the celestial worlds and the liturgical and magical-theurgical means that provide access to it.\" Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah , 21- 22. Essentially, and in a general sense, the roots of Jewish Kabbalah can be seen as having some Gnostic influences.

Union of Hokmah and Binah (through Kether ) 93 2. Union of Tiferet and Malkut 3. Union of Yesod and Malkut . In the case of Hokmah (Wisdom) and Binah (Understanding) the masculine Hokmah is referred to as Abba (father) and Binah is referred to as Imma (mother). These two sefirot symbolise the first separation into male a nd female (at least on an archetypal level). 94 On the level of Tiferet and Malkut we see the incestuous passion between “The Short-Faced One” ( Zeir Anpin ) and the “Daughter” ( Nukual ). 95 The Tetragrammaton ( יהוה ) symbolically reflects the same incestuous process: the Yod ( י ) symbolises the creative power of the Father who passes it to the first He ( ה ) who is the Mother. The Mother receives the creative power and passes it to the V au ( ו ) who is the Son. The Son passes the power to the final He ( ה ), the Daughter. The primal creative force emanates from the Father and reaches fruition in the Daughter. 96 Jung equates this union with the alchem ist’s “Chymical Wedding” and the union of the anima and animus 97 and quotes Knorr von Rosenroth who refers to Tiferet as the   93 Jung refers to this the union of Hokmah and Binah in two places within the Collected Works : CW 12 (Jung, Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy , par. 313.

But the comi ng Messiah will reunite the King and Queen and this mating will restore to God his original unity.” 100 Later, Jung indicates that the union of Tiferet and Malkuth is an example of the union of the “spiritual, masculine principle with the feminine, psychic principle...”. 101 Jung discusses the alchemist Vigenerus’ knowledge of the Sefer ha-Zohar when elaborating on the symbol of a stone pillar or statue. Jung indicates that the pillar mentioned in Genesis 28:22 is Malkut when she is united with Tiferet . “The stone is evidently a reminder that here the upper (Tifereth) has united with the lower (Malkuth): Tifereth the son has come together with the ‘Matrona’ in the hierosgamos.” 102 In some representations the Tree of Life, as Adam Kadmon , is pictured as a vertical arrangement of the Tetragrammaton.

Jung cites Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbalah denudata when discussing Yesod as the genital region of the “Original Man” “...for Malchuth shall be called a watered gard en, Isaiah 58:11, when Yesod is in her, and fills her, and waters her with waters from on high” and “When Malchuth receives the inflowing from the fifty gates through Yesod, then is she called the bride”. 104 Yesod is also seen as the mediator between Tiferet and Malkut 105 and the unifying factor between the two sides of the Tree of Life, le ft (feminine) and right (masculine). 106 These sexually charged images are a cen tral component of alchemy, Kabbalah, and Jung’s understanding of the psyche.

In psychological terms the nigredo corresponds to the confrontation with repressed shadow material. 107 As the shadow has been brought to cons ciousness (keeping in mind that this process is never fully co mpleted) the Conjunction proper begins. The first stage of the Conjunction is the unio mentalis or mental union. 108 In the unio mentalis the “spirit” separates the “soul” 109 from the confines of bodily appetites. According to the alchemical tradition, th e soul as Mercurius 110 stands between th e body and the higher moral aspirations of the spirit. If left on its own, the soul would side with the body. To guide the soul intense ascetic practises must be undertaken in order to encourage the soul to gravitate towards the spirit and away from an egocentric perspective.

Jung tells us that “if Dorn...saw the consummation of the mysterium coniunctionis in the union of the alchemically produced caelum with the unus mundus , he expressly meant not a fusion of the individu al with his environment, or even his adaptation to it, but a unio mystica with the potential world.” 133 In analytical psychological parlance, the process from the shadow work to the integration is a life long process that defies completion. There is no quick fix in the individuation process. 134 The psychological alchemist must car efully and consistently tend his or her inner laboratory while being mindful of the underlyi ng transpersonal ground of the unus mundus .

The first stage represents the state of original wholeness prior to consciousness. The first transitional step, step (a), leads to the first split. This is the step where the self divides into two, corresponding to \"the theme of the World Parents.\" Stage 2 is the beginning of ego development which is characterised by the separation of subject and object. At this point the ego starts to experience itself as separate from the world while still being caught in the polarity between Nature (Mother) and Spirit (Father). Step (b) represents the full separation from the Mother (Nature). Stage 3 is autonomous, independent thinking. Step (c) then brings about separation from the Fath er (Spirit). Finally, Stage 4 is characterised by independent, autonomous being, a stat e where the original unity has been differentiated into a fourfold multiplicity. Now the individual is living fully in this world. 136 Likely this stage woul d be equivalent to the unio naturalis . Eventually this fourth stage begins to lose its lustre. At the fourth stage the individual has full psychic differentiation and is fully part of society but insight into the inadequacy of this state of being begins to surface. This would be the alchemical equivalent of the four elements beginning to fa ll apart. Once this inadequacy takes root the individuation process begins the mo tion back \"up\" towards wholeness.

Here the ego has achieved the acceptance of the opposites and is able to endure the paradox of the psyche's two- sidedness. Following this crucial and mysterious process the i ndividual enters step (c) or the unus mundus which leads to Stage 1 where universal wholeness prevails. Step (c) represents a union of the ego with the self and with the world. Accord ing to Edinger, at this level \"time and eternity are united and synchroni city prevails.\" 137 Although Jung does not recount identically the process that Edinger does, Edinger's interpretation does give a helpful amplification of Jung's understanding of the alchemical process. There are obvious similarities between th e patterns found in alchemy and those found in Kabbalah. The “Breaking of the Vesse ls” is equal to the preliminary state of the nigredo wherein the four elements begin to fall apart. Once the state of differentiation is underway and the psychol ogical projections are becoming understood the process of reintegration, th e psychological equivalent of tikkun can begin.

Jung was not only interested in the ph ilosophical/spiritual nature of the sefirot and their relationship to alchemy. He al so found that the numeration of the sefirot and the connecting paths of the Tree of Life significant as can be s een in his reference to the number 32 in the World Clock Dream of Wolfgang Pauli.

Also, thr ough hermeneutic practices such as gematria , the number of a word reveals something about that word ’s nature and by extens ion, its relation to other words of the same numeration. In Kabbalah, the number ten is, among other things, representative of the ten sefirot 139 ; it is also the number of creation and order. 140 The number thirty-two also plays an important role in the Sefer Yetsirah . The number corresponds to the Thirty-two Path s of Wisdom of God.

The same reference to order is evident with the sefirot . 140 Leonora Leet’s The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah: Recovering the Key to Hebraic Sacred Science (Vermont: Inner Traditions, 1999) is an interesting work that demonstrates the connection between Jewish Kabbalah and sacred geometry."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 108 paths connecting the sefirot on the image of the Tree of Life. 141 Jung mentions the significance of both the number ten and thirty-two within his work involving alchemy and Kabbalah. 142 However, the more interesting number is thirty-two with its role in Jung’s amplification of Wolfgang Pauli’s “Wor ld Clock Dream.” In this dream we see the number thirty-two as a symbol of order and structure in a re lationship of Kabbalah and analytical psychology. Jung make s mention of Pauli’s dream in both CW 11 (“Psychology and Religion”) and CW 12 (“Individual Dream Sym bolism in Relation to Alchemy”) but it is only in latter that he c onnects the dream to the Thirty-two Paths of Kabbalah and so it is to there that we turn our attention. Wolfgang Pauli’s World Clock Dream is a powerful image. The complexity and intricacies of the dream are so remarkable that it is little wonder that Jung would mention this dream in two separate places within the Collected Works . Here is one presentation of the dream: There is a vertical and a horizonta l circle, having a common centre. This is the world clock. It is supported by the black bird. The vertical circle is a blue disc with a white border divided into 4 X 8—32 partitions. A pointer rotates upon it. The horizontal circle consists of four colours. On it stand four little men with pe ndulums, and round it is laid the ring that was once dark and is now golden (formerly carried by four children). The world clock has three rhythms or pulses: 1) The small pulse: the pointer on the blue vertical disc advances by 1/32. 2) The middle pulse: one complete rotation of the pointer. At the same time the horizontal circle advances by 1/32. 3) The great pulse: 32 middle pulses are equal to one complete rotation of the golden ring. 143   141 The first ten paths are the sefirot themselves while the remaining twenty-two paths (the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet) connect the sefirot . 142 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 313. 143 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 307."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 109 This dream came at the culmination of a series of dreams that Pauli had been experiencing over the period of his analysis. The symbolism within the dream is one of completion, wholeness, and order. As can be seen from the above description of Pauli’s dream the number thirty-two is evident in th e various “pulses” or rhythms of the Clock. In “Individual Dream Symbolism in Re lation to Alchemy”, Jung looks to the Sefer Yetsirah for its use of the “thirty-tw o paths of mysterious wisdom.” 144 As mentioned in Chapter One, the paths are the basis for creation, for direction, and for differentiation. The thirty-two paths are also related to the “Ancient of Days”, another form of Adam Kadmon . Interestingly, Jung cites René Allendy’s Les Symbolisme le nombres regarding the number thirty-two: 32...is the differentiation which app ears in the organic world; not creative generation, but rather the plan and arrangement of various forms of created things which the creator has modelled- as the product of 8x4... 145 Allendy’s emphasis is the number thirty-two suggests a plan or arrangement of created things. In other words, the number thirty-two represents order and structure of existence. Similarly, the quaternity and double-quaternity are noted by J ung to represent wholeness and order. 146 Although Jung only mentions the Kabbalistic reference in passing, Pauli’s dream still reveals an interesting connection to Ka bbalah and the collective unconscious. It   144 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 313. 145 Jung, “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy”, CW 12 , par. 313. 146 As an aside, Jung’s emphasis on the connection between the quaternity and mandala s is well documented. However, many mandala s, especially those of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism emphasise the number five. Generally there are four deities around the circle with a fifth, the deity being focused on, at the centre of the mandala . Even when looking at an equilateral cross, as a symbol of a quaternity there is a fifth point in the centre where the extremities meet. In this context a “quinternity,” and thus a figure such as the pentagram, would be a symbol of wholeness. For more on the philosophy behind mandalas see Denise Patry Leidy and Robert A.F.

Although the imagery is not unique to Kabbalah, there is one other interesting connection between Pauli’s dream and Kabbalah. Each sefira has a corresponding spiritual e xperience. In the case of Yesod the corresponding vision, at least in some Esoteric Kabbalistic Traditions, is the Vision of the Machinery of the Universe. 147 Another way of interpreti ng this vision would be as a vision of the order or structure that underp ins the universe. Fr om a psychological perspective, this could be a filtered glimpse of the self, as central organiser of the individual psyche. In this role the self would have obvious symbols of a collective nature, many of which are reflected in Pauli’s dream. 148 Both Kabbalah and Jung have used the sefirot in a way that order and definition were placed upon a previously ex isting chaos. In the case of Kabbalah the chaos is both the external, created universe in all its dive rsity, and the individual’s position within the universe. The Kabbalists worked from the macrocosm of the divine realms and the universe to the microcosm of the individual and his/her personal re lation to God and, by extension, existence. In many wa ys Jung applied Kabbalah and the sefirot in the same manner but in reverse order; moving from th e psyche of the individual and moving out into the world of form. Jung’s use of Kabbalah and the sefirot is rather limited in comparison with the amount of work done with alchemy. However, the alchemy that so fascinated Jung was itself heavily influenced by Kabbalah in many ways.

In both cases there is a structure of order placed on the chaos of the collective unconscious. The sefirot help to narrow the focus as it were, to specific portions of the objective psyche giving a se nse of connection, inte rpenetration and, to some degree, harmony and wholeness.

The term “Western Esoteric Tradition” is used here instead of the more popular term “Occult Tradition” in an attempt to shed some of the more outlandish associations. Yet even the use of “Western Esoteric Tradition” is not devoid of pr oblems. As we have seen scholars such as Faivre employ the term in a different way. For these authors Western Esotericism refers to a more historica lly palatable pattern of thought, a pattern of thought where names like Pico, Bruno, Dee, Agrippa and Bacon figure prominently. Chapter One presented a brief definition of the Western Esoteric Tradition. The following definition is an amalgamation of traditional definitions of Magick, a term synonymous with the Western Esoteric Tradition, coupled with an analytical psychological application of metaphor. By integrating a standard, yet somewhat vague, definition from the Western Esot eric Tradition and a key com ponent or factor within the theories of analytical psychology, we reach a more specific and pragmatic definition. (Re)Defining Magic(k) and Magic(k)ians A synonymous term for Western Esoter ic Tradition is simply “Magick”. 1 The “k”, popularised by Crowley and commonly applied today, was adopted so as to differentiate the spiritual undert akings of Magick from stage conjuring and slight of hand common in the 19 th Century. 2 Another reason, and only one of many, for the use of the “k” is that it is the first letter of kteis (Greek reference to the vulva) thus revealing an intimate connection between Magick and sexual ity. In this application the sexuality can   1 However, the term “Magick” is also applied to New Age traditions as well as Wiccan or Neo-Pagan traditions. The use of the term in the context of this thesis is a reference to th e Western Esoteric Tradition. 2 Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba (Parts I-IV) , 2 nd ed., (York Beach, ME: Weiser, 1997), 47."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 114 be seen as a reference to th e sexual cosmology of traditio ns such as “left-hand path” Tantra ( V ā m ā ch ā ra ) or, in the alchemical and Jungian sense, of the conjoining of opposites. In either case ther e is the understanding that a un ion of opposites results in a reordering or transformation of consciousness. 3 Not all Esotericists agree with the use of this spelling of Magick. In the introduction to his Inner Traditions of Magic William Gray states: What follows is unashamedly and perhaps blatantly about something which up till recently has always been called ‘Magic’. (Without the ‘k’ please Mr. Crowley !) Twist, turn hide, or distort the word into as much gobbledegook as anyone likes, Magic is, and always will be, a fundamental mainspring of human aspirational behaviour. 4 Despite the differences in spelling we need to establish a set definition; a definition that is at once structured enough to hold merit within an analytical psychol ogical perspective yet inclusive enough to allow the diversity and uni queness of the Western Esoteric Tradition to be reflected in a meaningful manner. To begin the process of defining Magick we turn to various writers from within the Western Esoteric Tradition, in other words practitioners of Magick. As a spiritual tradition, the Western Esoteric Tradition operates from a specific world-view complete with its own assumptions and assertions about reality and occasionally these assumptions and assertions are revealed in a rather enthusiastic manner. This “enthusiasm” can appear to run contrary to more detached and critical academic sources.   3 Another reason the “k” was added can be seen in Aleister Crowley’s use of the number eleven. For Crowley eleven is the number of Magick. Traditio nal Kabbalistic Magic revered the number of the sefirot , ten. Crowley emphasised breaking the old way of viewin g Magick by stressing the reality and role of an eleventh sefirot , Da’at . “K” is also the eleventh number of the English alphabet, thus giving a new credence to the use of English as a sacred language (whereas, prior to this, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew were the primary languages used in Magick). These are only a few of the many applications of the number eleven. 4 William Gray, Inner Traditions of Magic (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1984), 9."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 115 Lévi defined the essence of Magick (though he employed the more traditional spelling “Magic”) as “that which God created be fore all things when he said: ‘Let there be light’; at once substance and move ment, fluid and perpetual vibration.” 5 In her classic work on mysticism, Evelyn Underhill states th at magic “in its uncorrupted form, claims to be a practical, intellectual , highly individualistic science; working towards the declared end of enlarging the sphere on which the human will can work, and obtaining experimental knowledge of planes of bein g usually regarded as transcendental.” 6 Esotericists Denning and Phillips define Magick as “the production of desired effects, whether in the person of the magician or ex terior to it, by means of a deliberate and special use of powers and faculties within the psyche.” 7 Aleister Crowle y defined Magick as “the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.” 8 To that definition Crowley added, “Every intentional act is a Magickal Act.” 9 Dion Fortune defined Magick as “The Science and Art of causing change in consciousness at will.” 10 Each of these definitions helps to focus our investigation, yet each is still too vague and has an important component missing. Lévi’s definition is ethereal and poetic. From within the Tradition it remains an apt definition, but it does little for our current concerns. Crowley’s definition, while less poetic than Lévi’s, is rath er too ambiguous and easily mi sunderstood.

One concept, taken from an analytical psychological perspective, which could be ad ded to the Crowley/Fortune definition to add even more invaluable deta il, is the term “metaphor.” Our working definition now becomes “Magick is the Science and Art of changing consciousness, through the medium of metaphor, in conformity with Will.” Let us take a moment to unpack this definition. The terms Science and Art imply that there are dual operations occurring simultaneously within Magick. 11 Science is employed here in the sense of “objective” observation of one’s experiences, in other words, the application of the scientific method, understood in the broadest sense, to one’s e xperiences and practices . Those rituals or activities that are deemed succe ssful and repeatable are reta ined while those that lack success or repetition are aba ndoned. One way this objec tivity is thought to be accomplished within the Tradition is through the use of a journal or Magical Record that records Esoteric practices and experiences. Data such as time, location, weather, emotional state, state of health, astrological/a stronomical statistics, and type of practices along with the subjective and objective results of those practices are typically recorded. Similarly, the recording of one’s genealogy and psychological and medical history can also be included in an attempt to disclose possible influences in one’s predispositions and perceptions. 12   11 For more detail on the connection between science, art, religion, and Magick see Lionel Snell’s “Four Glasses of Water: Magic considered as a ‘culture’ distin ct from art, science or religion, and how this could help clarify discussion of the broad spectrum of magical, pagan, New Age and ‘alternative’ beliefs and practices” in David Evans (ed.)

Within this context, Magick also includes an observation and recording of one’s mental processes. There is also similar unders tanding of science found in MDR . Jung, discussing his confrontation with the unconscious, states : “From the beginning I had conceived my voluntary confrontation with the unconscious as a scientific experiment which I myself was conducting and in whose outcome I was v itally interested. T oday I might equally well say that it was an experime nt which was being conducted on me .” 13 Magick involves a sense of curiosity a nd a drive for investigation th at manifests as an ongoing experiment into the depths of the psyche or soul. Similar to Jung’s citation, we could see at least from a certain perspective, that th e grand experiment we are calling Magick is equally the experimenter in the sense that th e beings encountered w ithin the processes of the Tradition are experienced as autonomous and occasionally seem to reflect their own agenda. The Esotericist peers into the depths of their being but we could say there are beings, experienced as though autonomous, which also stare back with equal interest.

Ritual practi ce is thought to engage all th e senses through the use of various drivers that help nudge consciousness in different and willed directions. The implements or tools commonly used in Magick (robes, candles, and tools such as dagger, pentacle, wand, and cup) relate to the senses of touch and si ght.

Finally, the highly symbolic and metaphoric images re late to the imaginat ion and psychological components of the individual. Both the “science” and “art” portions of this definition imply engagement and action in the material world and not solely research or study.

The use of ritual requires the body and mind to work in tandem an d point the mind to “higher” regions of consciousness. Also, the changes or transforma tions that occur as a result of the practices of the Western Esoteric Tradition must be integrated into one’s place in the world.

These intonations can also be given in what is commonly referred to as the Voice of Silence.

Those who allow the self to speak and who are aware of their own projections live differe nt lives than those who have yet to do so. Those people who st rive for self-understanding still hold jobs, have families or other relations, and participate in varying degrees of social intercourse. Andrew Samuels summarises this relation between the self a nd ego succinctly in Jung and the Post-Jungians : The ego-ideal is abandoned in favou r of self-acceptance and, more importantly, the super-ego, in its negative form of blind adherence to collective norms, is replaced as a moral arbiter by the self acting as inner guide. What we are de scribing is a separation from the collective, together with an assumption of responsibility for oneself and a developed attit ude towards past and future. 20 The ego in this citation is not abandoned; it, as part of the process of individuation, adapts to the influences and symbols of the self and the unconscious.

Within most branches of th e Western Esoteric Trad ition the very early stages of training i nvolve techniques of pr ā n ā y ā ma or techniques of breath control. 21 The controlling of the breath, coupled with rela xation, visualisations and drivers such as incense, help to alter blood and brain chemistry. As with other form s of meditation, with repeated practice the ability to calm the mind becomes more pronounced. However, there still remains a question as to what is to occur with this newly found change in consciousness and how is it to be used. An important contribution to the answer of this question of intent can be found in the landscape of metaphor. In Robert Romanyshyn’s essay, Alchemy and the Subtl e Body of Metaphor , Jung’s relationship with Philem on is analysed in a way that grants Philemon a unique and substantial reality. Philemon’s reality was not limited solely to Jung’s psyche nor was it entirely independent from it. Romanyshyn brin gs to the fore several important questions regarding the nature of Philemon: What shall we call this subtle presence of Philemon who is neither a factual object in this world . . . nor a subjective idea in Jung’s mind which he projects onto the world? What is the nature of the subtle body of Philemon who is neither thing nor a thought? Philemon haunts the garden of Jung. He plays on the border of the real and the ideal, hovering like some great being of light, a vibration which at one moment seems substantive like a particle and at another moment without subs tance like a wave. Philemon is an imaginal being . . . Philemon, I would claim, is the subtle body of metaphor. 22   21 See: Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba , 18-21, the Ciceros’ Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn Tradition 2 nd ed.

Romanyshyn. “Alchemy and the Subtle Body of Metaphor” in Pathways into the Jungian World . Roger Brooke, ed. (New York: Routledge, 2000), 32."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 121 Romanyshyn suggests we are to view Phile mon as a subtle body that is neither real in the sense of possessing a quantifiable tangibility nor wholly subjective. Philemon is a subtle body of metaphor. Jung emphasi ses the fact that rather than over intellectualise what Philemon and the whole fantasy meant, it was better “...to let the figures be what they were for me at the time—namely events and experiences.” 23 For Jung the fantasy involving Philemon was separate from himself: Philemon represented a force which was not myself. In my fantasies I held conversations with him, and he said things which I had not consciously thought. For I observed clearly that it was he who spoke, not I. 24 Jung also states that psychologically Philemon represented superior insight. 25 A superior insight, we can presume, that was perceive d as functioning inde pendently from Jung’s everyday ego consciousness. The insight s possessed by Philemon were significant enough to put Jung in a position of concern fo r the possible devaluing of his ego when Philemon would “appear.” 26 Ultimately, Jung acknowledged that Philemon acted as a guru and guide of some importance. 27 Romanyshyn goes on to describe what he means by metaphor: The neither/nor logic of metaphor, the logic of the third between matter and mind, the realm of the soul , requires that one must give up the notion of being able to attribute with final certainty that the epiphany of meaning belongs either on the side of consciousness as experience, or on the side of the world as an event. The either/or logic of the mi nd is undone in the neither/nor logic of soul. 28   23 Jung, MDR , 182. 24 Jung, MDR , 183. 25 Jung, MDR , 183. 26 Jung, MDR , 184. 27 Jung, MDR , 183-184. 28 Romanyshyn, “Alchemy and the Subtle Body of Metaphor”, 35."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 122 Here we see that metaphor acts as a uni fying factor for the Cartesian split between mind and matter. Metaphor partic ipates in both worlds and helps relate the reality that the two are not, in fact, as divergent as may be generally understood. However, in order to come to participate in the experien ce of the metaphorical a certain type of consciousness is required: An incarnate consciousness is a fi rst, necessary step towards the recovery of the imaginal as real, and the real as imaginal. Starting with a body that is already mindful of the world, with a mind which is already kissed by things, phenomenology allows one to appreciate the metaphorical st ructure of reality and the metaphorical character of our expe rience. Soaked within this appreciation, we are ab le to be responsive to the third between material facts and mental ideas, the third of the imaginal, where metaphorical consciousness dwells . And such a consciousness is indispensable for encountering someone like Philemon who will not yield himself to the literal mi nded or to a thinking which is too rational. 29 This understanding of metaphor is one way the “change of consciousness” can be understood in our definition of Magick. In a comparable way, the entities encountered via methods such as pathworking or explorations of the “Astral Plane” can be seen in the same light as Jung’s relationship with Philemon. The angels, demons and related beings found throughout the Western Esoteric Traditi on dwell within the world of metaphor. The change in consciousness can be seen as encouraging or being open to the perceptions of the world of metaphor. Other scholars and writers such as Jame s Hillman and Henry Corbin have also made substantial contributions to the study of metaphor. Hillman’s view of metaphor can be found in his work within Archetypal psychology. 30 Corbin’s study of Islam, in   29 Romanyshyn, “Alchemy and the Subtle Body of Metaphor”, 39. 30 See especially, James Hillman, The Dream and the Underworld (NY: Harper and Row, Publishers, 1979) and Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account (Dallas, TX: Spring Publications, 1988)."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 123 particular the Sufi tradition, is also rele vant to understand th e nature of metaphor. 31 However, it is Romanyshyn’s refined and eleg ant appreciation of me taphor that relates most satisfactorily within the contex t of the definition of Magick. Some of the most vivid and perhap s complex astral (i.e. metaphorical) recollections from within the Western Esot eric Tradition (“rece ived” through a polished stone that was employed as a visual focal point) are recorded in Aleister Crowley’s The Vision and the Voice . The following example is from Crowley’s experience with the 22 nd Aethyr or level of the Enochian system of Magick. The opening vision is as follows: There comes first into the stone th e mysterious tabl e of forty-nine squares. It is surrounded by an innumerable company of angels; these angels are of all kinds, —s ome brilliant and flashing as gods, down to elemental creatures. The light comes and goes on the tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive that each letter of the tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a language which looks like that of Honorius; but when I would read, the letter that I look at becomes indistinct at once. And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing. This Angel has all the colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud and beautiful; his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and black, like cascades of water, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of the seven hol y metals, upon which he plays. I cannot tell you how wonderful the music is, but it is so wonderful that one only lives in one's ears; one ca nnot see anything any more. 32 What these visions meant to Crowley or what they may reflect psychologically is not at issue. Rather, this example reveals one person’s experience with the realm of metaphor from within the cosmology of the Western Esoteric Tradition. The remainder of The Vision and the Voice is equally vivid and revealing. For Crowley, and other Esotericists   31 See for example Henry Corbin, Creative Imagination in the Sufism if Ibn’Arabi , Ralph Manheim trans. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Un iversity Press, 1981). 32 Aleister Crowley, The Vision and the Voice with Commentary and Other Papers (York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, 1998), 78."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 124 who have employed this type of Magick, the residents of the Enochian Aethyrs can be seen as representing metaphors of superior insight, though the Esotericist may be more inclined to view the metaphors as objective beings. 33 As indicated above, to fully appreciate the landscape of metaphor one must be firmly grounded in this world. This fact is important when applied to the Western Esoteric Tradition in that a conversation w ith a metaphorical being like Philemon or the angels of Crowley’s vision when one is lack ing a strong, or rather healthy, ego-complex is not likely to be a beneficial one especi ally when the line between instructive and destructive psychic experiences can be blurry even under the best conditions. We can assume that without a firm grounding in the phenomenal world there are increased risks to ego consciousness and real and lasting imp lications for the indi vidual who experienced them when dealing with these t ypes of metaphorical entities. Though perhaps not stated as such, the fora y into imaginal or metaphorical worlds is at the root of the philo sophy and practices of the West ern Esoteric Tradition. The practices within the Tradition rely heavily upon imagination. Some practitioners may regard any experiences as occurring within th eir psyche while others may posit that the imagination is simply a way for our mind to in terpret the existence of alternate realties. Whatever one’s perspective, the goal of th ese philosophies and practices is an ever- widening field of consciousness and perception or, perhaps more relevant to our focus, the goal could be seen as cultivating a Ma gickal or metaphorical world-view. The objective could be seen as a personal frame of reference that includes and embraces not only the phenomenal and the psychological (menta l) factors of life but also the unifying   33 For another example of Enochian ex periences see: Lon Milo DuQuette, My Life with the Spirits , (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weis er, Inc., 199 9), 133-155.

Through the medium of the metaphorical world comes th e vocabulary of the Tree of Life; a place where the paths and the sefirot speak through the language of symbolic correspondences. With this brief review of metaphor complete we are left with the final factor in the definition of Magick to be explored. The implication of “will” in our definiti on is twofold. First, will implies volition on the part of the Esotericist. This is one factor that places the Western Esoteric Tradition apart from Spiritualist practices. From the outset the Esotericist remains in control of his or her consciousness. That is to say there is an openness toward the metaphorical world but that openness is cont ained within the structure and cosmology of the Western Esoteric Tradition. Cultivated passivity or surrender to metaphorical or archetypal realms, such as found in religions like Vodoun or practices such as Spiritualism is not generally considered a part of the Western Esoteric Tradition. 34 “Will” within the Tradition also has a second connotation that resonate s well with the writings of James Hillman. In the opening paragraph of his work The Soul’s Code , Hillman describes a sense of fate encountered in life: There is more in a human life than our theories of it allow. Sooner or later something seems to call us onto a particular path. You may remember this “something” as a single moment in childhood when an urge out of nowhere, a fascination, a peculiar turn of events struck like an annunciation: This is what I must do, this is what I’ve got to have. This is who I am. 35   34 At least this is not the case in an overt way. Many times though the esotericist may be “enflamed” in prayer which implies an openness or supplication, as is the case with the Holy Guardian Angel and the Abramelin Operation which is dealt with below. This example is more the exception than the rule. In the philosophy of the Western Esoteric Tradition, some form of conscious control or perception of one’s surroundings is implied. 35 James Hillman, The Soul’s Code (New York: Random House, 1996), 3."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 126 This sense of fate or “This is who I am” is wh at Esotericists such as Aleister Crowley are referring to when they use the term “True W ill.” True Will reflects the direction one’s personality tends toward when free, or as free as possible, from psychological and social constrictions. In other words, when one begins to understand one’s own psychological projections and those psychological fetters im posed by social/political/religious sources one can come to understand one’s “True Will.” To summarise, Magick, which is s ynonymous with the Western Esoteric Tradition, is the Science and Art of causi ng change in consciousness, through the medium of metaphor, in conformity with will. This definition implies that Magick is a set of practices that are both objective (“ scientific”) and subjectively expressive (“artistic”). 36 These practices are thought to lead to a widening of consciousness and help to build a bridge betw een the objective world and th e subjective psychological world. This bridge or “third ” function is the world of meta phor. Each of these practices and experiences are to be undertaken, according to the Tradition, in a controlled or willed manner and should, for optimum benefit, follow or encourage what James Hillman refers to as a “calling of the Soul” or what Aleister Crowley termed the True Will. One of the most effective ways of anal ysing how Magick works in practice is to return to the Western Esoteric Tradition’s inte rpretation of the Tree of Life. The Tree of Initiation in the Western Esoteric Tradition As mentioned above, the sefirot in the Western Esoteric Tradition are generally applied as a structure of ini tiation and self-exploration. Th e term initiation can be taken   36 We could also see in this definition the union of Eros and Logos."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 127 in two general ways within the Western Es oteric Tradition. The first meaning is initiation in the sense that one passes from one grade to another within the initiatory scheme of an Order. Phenomena such as de grees, signs, grips, and Knowledge Lectures would fall under this definition. 37 For the sake of simplicity we shall refer to this type of initiation as “ceremoni al” initiation. A second meaning of initiation would refe r to the experiences that presumably underpin the ceremonial initiation. This experiential initiation will be termed “transformative” initiation. An example of th e idea behind the transformative initiation taken from the perspective of analytical psychology could be when a person comes to understand and experience the nature and functi on of the shadow and its projections or when transference occurs within therapy. Th e assumption is that there are elementary, and ultimately predictable and repeatable, chan ges or transformations that occur in the individual on a microcosmic or psychological level. Until th at experience is reached or the transformation occurs one cannot progress to the next stage of development, or at the very least, that progression beco mes much more difficult without it. 38 Generally speaking, there are two Paths of initiation that appear on the Western Esoteric Tradition’s Tree of Life. 39 Though each Path will eventually culminate in the same goal, the approach of each is significantly different. Both Paths can involve transformative and/or cerem onial initiations depending on the individual and his or her particular type of practice with in the Tradition. The first path is known as the Path of the   37 Orders such as the HOGD and the Ordo Templi Orientis, following obvious Masonic influences, frequently employ various grips, passwords, and Lectures at different levels of progression. 38 There are many problems with using terms lik e “ceremonial” and “transformative” in relation to initiation. Obviously “ceremonial initiations” can be linked closely to “t ransformative initiations” or, then again, not at all. These terms are adop ted only for the convenience of analysis. 39 Please see Figure Three, p.327."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 128 Arrow. 40 This Path corresponds to the sefirot Malkut , Yesod , Tiferet , Da’at , and Kether . The Path of the Arrow is a mystical path of development. To elaborate, this Path has the sense that one’s ego perceptions (for our purposes this would be Malkut , more on this below) either dwells in or is inundated by divinity or unity ( Kether ). 41 This Path is the most direct route to the transp ersonal wholeness symbolised by Kether . The Path of the Serpent, in contradist inction, methodically wi nds its way through the sefirot , experiencing each initiation (shift of consciousness), usually in a sequential fashion. 42 This process of ceremonial initiation is most evident within the structure of a Magical Order. Although the ceremonial init iations of Magical Or ders commonly follow the Path of the Serpent, the most significant initiations occur along th e Middle Pillar (the Path of the Arrow). The initiatory processes of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn will be reviewed as an example of a “traditional” Western Esoteric or Magical Order. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was actually comprised of three separate but connected Orders consisting of vari ous grades or levels of development. 43 The Third   40 Fortune states that the Path “straight up the Central Pillar, is called the Path of the Arrow, which is shot from Qesheth, the Bow of Promise; it is the route that the mystic rises upon the planes; the initiate, however, adds to his experience the powers of the Side Pillars as well as the realizations of the Middle Pillar.” Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2000), 269. Knight states that the “vertical line up the Tree is the Path of the Arrow, the Way of the Mystic, who seeks not the manipulation of occult powers but Union with God.” Gareth Knight, A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weis er, Inc., 1993), v.II, 145. 41 In actuality the motion is thought to be a passive one, more like there is an “indwelling” of Kether in Malkut . The mystical experience is of the divine attribut es of the Crown being reflected or perceived in the Kingdom. 42 According to Fortune “...in old pictures a serpent is often depicted as twined about the boughs of the Tree. This is the serpent Nechushtan ‘who holdeth his tail in his mouth,’ the symbol of wisdom and initiation. The coils of the serpen t, when correctly arranged on the Tree, cross each of the Paths in succession and serve to indicate the order which they should be numbered.” Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 24.

The First Order, the A. . . A. . . 46 was comprised of the grad es Magister Templi (8=3), Magus (9=2), and Ipsissmus (10=1). 47 The grades of the various Orders follo wed a prescribed path through each of the sefirot found on the Tree of Life while the Neophyte (0=0) waited for admission on the outskirts of the Tree. 48 Upon entering the Golden Dawn proper the newly initiated Neophyte (0=0) was introduced to the teachings of the Order. 49 These teachings are reproduced in varying degrees of cl arity in Volume One of Crowley’s Equinox , the Ciceros’ Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn Tradition , and Regardie’s The Golden Dawn .

First, the ritual is a form of prayer to divinity or one’s “higher self” usually performed in the morning and evening. Second, th e ritual is thought to be a rite of protection against “impure magnetism, the Banishing Ritual can be used to get rid of obsessing or disturbing thoughts.” 52 The Western Esoteric method of giving a mental image to the “obsession” can be accomplished through visual isation alone or it could be accompanied by more tangible images such as painting, draw ing, or sculpture. Once the “obsession” is objectified it is visualised as being separated from the individual and then it is banished away with the LBRP. This exercise could then be repeated as necessary until the obsession no longer possesses the same disruptive charge. 53 The third function of the LBRP is that it can be used as an exercise in concentration a nd visualisation. By visualising oneself conducting the ritual in as detailed manner as pos sible (sight, smell, auditory detail, and touch) one’s visualisation skills are honed. These skills are later applied to various practices involvin g metaphorical and symbolic images. The order and structure of the sefirot are introduced to the Neophyte (0=0) and function on both an intellectual le vel, through the names of the sefirot and the Hebrew alphabet, and on an emotional and spiritual level through the introduction of the LBRP.   50 Unless otherwise noted the Knowledge Lectures are taken from Regardie, The Golden Dawn , 50-111. 51 In order to get a feel for the type of ritual conducted in the Western Esoteric Tradition please see Appendix A for the text of the LBRP, p.329. 52 Regardie, The Golden Dawn , 54. 53 This exercise is also give n in Donald Michael Kraig’s Modern Magick , 124-130 as the I.O.B. technique (Identify, Objectify, Banish)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 131 The first part of the LBRP, the Qabalistic Cross, is said to activate Kether , Malkut , Geburah , Hesed , and Tiferet in sequence. This act is thought to place the Magician at the centre of his or her Universe. The entire ritual, in essen ce, places the Magician in the centre of a large mandala with the Archangels correspond ing to the four quarters, the four Elements and their microcosmic attribut es (roughly from East to North: intellect, will, emotion, body). In the centre of the circle stands the Magician facing, as it were, Tiferet with Hod to the left, Netzach to the right, and Yesod to the rear. Then, at the culmination of the ritual the Middle Pillar, with its roots in Kether , descends into the Magician’s circle, that is to say, his or her mandala . In a paper entitled “Notes on the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram” Crowley states “Those who regard this ritual as a mere device to invoke or banish spirits, are unworthy to possess it. Properly understood, it is the Medicine of Metals a nd the Stone of the Wise.” 54 In this context, the LBRP is understood to be much more than a simple introductory ritual. For the Western Esotericist it is thought to have transforma tive psychological and sp iritual properties. The Second Knowledge Lecture of the Golden Dawn introduces the Zelator (1=10) to alchemical symbolism, meditation ex ercises, the concept of the Four Worlds of Kabbalah 55 , and the image of the Tree of Life with the numbered paths. At this point the very basics of Tarot are in troduced (i.e. number of ca rds and suits).

The most important portion of the Fourth Knowledge Lecture is the exploration of the Major Arcana of the Tarot (numbers 0 to 21). The Practicus (3=8) is shown that each of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are equated to a Major Arcana card which, in turn, is linked to one of the Thirty- Two Paths of the Tree of Life. The fifth and final Knowledge Lecture of the Golden Dawn (i.e, the Third Order) for the Philosophus (4=7) grade, gives much more complex information loosely based on a “traditional” Jewish Kabbalistic cosmol ogy. More time is spent on the Tree and its many correspondences. The most important po rtion of the Fifth Knowledge Lecture for our purposes is its outline of the prerequisites for the Adeptus Minor 5=6 grade (i.e., the first grade of the Second Order): 1. A Thesis on the Rituals 2. A meditation on the crosses which have been used as admission badges in the Grades. . . 3. A complete diagram of the Tree of Life 4. The practice of control of the Aura 5. The placing of The Tree of Life in the Aura 6.

However, the third to sixth requirements reflect a more general focus. Requirement three has the individual construct a large Tree of Life onto which it was essential to list “Deity Names, Names of the Archangels and Angels in Hebrew in th e Sephiroth, and to number the Paths and give their attributions. Apart from this, the Tree should be your own personal synthesis of the Order symbolism as it applies to the Tree of Life.” 58 Here we see that the individual is instructed to create a Tree of Life that is uni que to his or her pers onal experience within the Order. The fourth requirement uses the standard Esoteric term “Aura”. The term aura is used in this context to refer to a part of the body that is not readily understood or measurable by conventional science. It is not understood as paranorm al energy; rather it is seen as connected to and is a part of our corporeal bodies. This idea is by no means unique to the Golden Dawn or the Western Es oteric Tradition; the most obvious parallel example would be the Eastern notion of chi / ki that is a subtle “ener gy” that radiates from the physical body. In the fourth requirement the initiate is to learn the basics of anatomy and the systems of the physical body. The initiate is informed that he or she must learn to manipulate the aura but in order to do that the initiate is instructed that they must: first try to get your em otional reactions under conscious control. Instead of automatically liking this, or disliking that, you must try to understand the mechanism whic h underlies these feelings. To assist you in this, the study of psychology is recommended. 59 According to this statement, in order to be able to manipulate the aura one must have an understanding of both the physiolo gical and psychological struct ures of the human being.   58 Regardie, The Golden Dawn , 88. 59 Regardie, The Golden Dawn , 88."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 134 These studies are thought to lead the initiate into a closer rapport with, and understanding of, their unique link between soma and psyche and spirit. One way, according to the Golden Dawn, to link the sefirot with the corporeal confines of the human body, was through th e ritual of the Middle Pillar (MPR). 60 The LBRP is thought to place the in itiate in the centre of his or her personal universe while maintaining a link with the penultimate state of balance and “wholeness” of Tiferet which, in turn, is linked to Kether . The Middle Pillar, on the other hand, is said to activate the energy centres (similar to but not identical with the chakras of various Eastern traditions) found throughout the body with the “energy” emanating from Kether . The MPR focuses on the interaction between th e individual and the Tree of Life via the sefirot of the Middle Pillar. By intoning various deity names the initiate is said to charge or activate the specific energy centre. 61 We see in the case of these rituals that the body and mind are both engaged as well as the third component th at links the two, the aura. The aura is neither wholly physical nor is it entirely psychological yet it particip ates on both a physical and psychological level. The aura, at least when it is used interchangeably with terms like “subtle body” or “astral body,” can be said to f unction within the world of metaphor. Jung makes several references to the “subtle body”, in the Collect Works . In those references, the subtle body takes a position of being part mental or spiritual and part physical; being both and neither simultaneously. 62 In Symbols of Transformation 63 Jung   60 See Appendix B for an outline of this ritual, p.333. 61 Kether -AHIH, Daat/Binah -YHVH ALHIM, Tiferet -YHVH ALOAH ve-DAATH, Yesod -SHADDAI AL CHAI, Malkut - ADNI HARTZ.

In “Concerning Rebirth”, Jung refers to the subtle body in the Christian understanding of resurrection 64 and in “The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fa irytales” he discusses the subtle body in the context of being an example of a physical aspect of spirit. 65 The same theme of the semi-materiality of spirit as subtle body is also found in “Psychology of Religion”. 66 Jung discusses the “ Bardo ” body, “which is a kind of ‘subtle body’ constituting the visible envelope of the psychic self in the after-death state” in his “Psychological Commentary on ‘The Tibetan Book of the Dead’”. 67 “Religious Ideas in Alchemy” 68 discusses whether or not the alchemical pro cess was more in the physical or spiritual realm. Jung claims that that “either/or” pers pective was not present in that age instead there was “an intermediate realm between mind and matter, i.e., a psychic realm of subtle bodies whose characteristic it is to manifest themselves in a mental as well as a material form.” 69 To return to the Western Esoteric notion of the aura, the aura brings together the body and mind while still existing with its own unique nature. The aura is guided and manipulated through will (volition) and imag ination.

The final ritual we will review, the Abramelin Operation, is traditionally undertaken at the Adeptus Minor (5=6) grade or later. 71 This grade corresponds to the Outer Portal of the Second Order and to Tiferet which, from an analytical psychological perspective, is equated to the notion of the self. The Abramelin Operation is a ritual used by the Golden Dawn that was taken from The Book of the Sacred Ma gic of Abra-Melin the Mage . 72 The Operation is intended to last six months and begins with the initia te setting aside a room within his or her house or a place specifically sanctified for the comple tion of the ritual, which is to become the \"oratory.\" In this oratory the initiate is to spen d a prescribed amount of time in solemn prayer. The type of prayer is left to personal choice but it must \"issue from the midst of your heart.\" 73 The time spent in prayer increases from a few minutes a day to several hours as the Operation progresse s. Along with the periods of prayer, the initiate must observe a fast of varying degrees throughout th e entire period. During the six months the initiate is obligated to avoid as much as possible, any kind of communication or sensual   70 This interpretation of Philemon would not be accep table by Jung as Philemon was not seen as an objective entity from an alternate plane of existence but rather an aspect of the psyche that had an autonomy that acted as if it were objective. 71 The Abramelin Operation is not unique to the Golden Dawn. Its roots are believed to be in the 15 th century, the Golden Dawn simp ly appropriated it into its already eclectic teachings. 72 The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage S.L.

However, Mathers was notorious for “transla ting” English manuscripts that had poor handwriting or organisation into English. Whatever the case, Math ers’ remains the most used translation of the text. The text will be hereon referred to as Abramelin . 73 Abramelin , 65."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 137 stimulation. The culmination of the Operation occurs with the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. According to Abramelin, the Angel: will never abandon you, he will lead you in the Way of the Lord, and he will watch carefully over you to assist you, and consent unto the present Operation of the Sacred Magic, so that you may be able to constrain the Spirit s accursed to God, unto the honour of Your Creator, and for your own good and that of your neighbour. 74 The \"Sacred Magic\" referred to in the above cita tion is not only the invocation of one's Holy Guardian Angel, it also includes an evocation of the Archangels who in turn control the Four Infernal Princes and th eir hierarchical and numerous legions. The premise is that the initiate, with the aid of hi s or her Holy Guardian Angel, utilises certain sigils or geometric seals to bind the demonic be ings into servitude. While this is the format of the Operation as found in The Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the individual application and experiences of the Operation as understood within the Golden Dawn would vary from initiate to initiate. For the Golden Dawn the emphasis was not primarily concerned with the literal s ubjugation of demons. Rather, the emphasis was much more on the connection of the initiate with his or her Holy Guardian Angel or Higher Genius, as a form of psychopomp that would aid the initiate and act as a source of inspiration and wisdom throughout his or her life. There are two interesting sources that i nvolve the Abramelin Operation, neither of which is connected in a ny direct way to the Golden Dawn’s initiatory schemata that will help clarify the nature of the Operation.

In Bloom’s Ab ramelin experience the initial two months of oration (prayer) have an overriding air of conflict and difficulty. For example, in his diary entry for May 11 we find Bloom state: Things happen during oration ab out which I cannot write. My head torn between complete madness as a veil thrown up to deceive me and a faith in the shock that it really happens. Whichever, it tears me apart and I have seen the Phoenix rising from the weeping ashes. 77 The conflict evident in the first two months increases significantly in the following two months.

For a few days now I have been meaning to mention something for the sake of someone/anyone into whose hands this diary may fa ll. Concerning this Operation, it is in human terms the most tough and frightening experience possible; apart from courage, it requires spiritual intelligence to prevent inevitable self -destruction. If anyone considers performing it, I most heavily advise them to meditate on it for at least twelve months beforehand before swearin g the oath to carry on through it. 80 The last two months find Bloom in mani c shifts in mood. At this point his practice consisted of ninety minutes of pray er, one hour of meditation, and five hours of “holy reading and messing about.” 81 Bloom’s approach is a mixture of mystical Christianity and Theosophy with some genera l occult theory added to the mix. Bloom increasingly makes use of te rms like worm, shame, sin, weakness, and other similar terms of supplication and denigration in reference to himself during this period. He is also noticeably taken with the psychologically prob lematic concept of the destruction of the personality by which we can assume he is referring to ego perspective. The final two months are marked by longer and in some ways more manic entries by Bloom. At the end of the Operation the pr actitioner is to invoke his or her angel and once this is accomplished he or she then commands the demons and devils of the “Infernal” hierarchy to swear allegiance to the practitioner and his/her HGA. In the Epilogue to The Sacred Magician Bloom states: So...I completed the great ce remony. I had achieved the Conversation. I had opened my mys tical awareness.

Unfortunately, or perhaps inevitably, Bloom was unable to reflect on his recent experiences of the preceding six months. He was riding a wave of prayer and meditation, not to me ntion psychological stress, a nd could not ground himself. Following the Operation his partner left for England for three weeks (they had up until that point been living together). During that time he was diagnosed w ith a severe case of Hepatitis B. Bloom was bedridden for several months a nd also had restricted oxygen flow to the brain, thus impairi ng his mental faculties. Added to this collection of malaise Bloom had several near death experien ces. Of the illness Bloom recounts: What a wonderful and extraordinary illness it was. How carefully my own soul or my Teacher 83 must have planned it. Twenty years later I can still think of no more effective or economical way of integrating my energies. How else could I have calmed my psychic explosion and transforme d my storming heaven pattern? 84 Bloom admits that he was not able to fully integrate the experience for nearly twenty years following his illness. Bloom initially commented that given that the Operation is an “extreme technique, belonging to a culture of wilf ul sacrifice and humbling devotion, which I associate with patriarchal modes” he did not feel it was suitable for “our emerging non- sexist and holistic spiritual culture.” 85 However, Bloom felt that the Operation might, at the very least, help develop self-discipline which he claims is essential to any spiritual   82 Bloom, The Sacred Magician , 149. 83 The Teacher in this case is either the Holy Guardian Angel or a “Spir itual” teacher , or both. 84 Bloom, The Sacred Magician , 150. 85 Bloom, The Sacred Magician , 152."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 141 path and even more so in the then fledgling New Age. Bloom felt that the New Age perspective of developing one’s own spiritual path was positive but “we need to be careful that, in disengaging from classical path s of spiritual approach, we do not also lose the skills that are essential for travelling the path.” 86 The preceding was a very brief review of one person’s experience with the Abramelin Operation. If we place the Operation within a Jungian context we can see that the Operation calls for six months of increa sing degrees of separa tion from both societal and, in an alchemical/psychological sense of the unio mentalis , bodily desires and then integration back into the bodily ( caelum ). Then, after facing what reveals itself to be six months of shadow oriented material, the practitioner objectifies the accomplishment by conversing and communing, even if only sym bolically, with the self (i.e. the Holy Guardian Angel) and symbolically placing the ego and shadow in direct rapport with the self. Bloom’s practice of the Operation follo wed a more or less traditional interpretation of the Book of the Sacred Magic but his is not the only interp retation available. While the above Jungian interpretation of the Operation was not present in the original text, one source actively adopts Jung’s t hought and model of the psyche. Newcomb’s updated interpretation of the Abramelin Operation begins with a different perspective. He states that the “experience of contac ting your Holy Guardian An gel is the marriage of your “human being” with your “divine self” — your conscious self w ith your unconscious self.” 87 With this rather Jungian stance Ne wcomb begins to introduce his understanding of the Operation.   86 Bloom, The Sacred Magician , 152-153. 87 Newcomb, 21 st Century Mage , viii."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 142 Newcomb dispenses with most of the dogma of the Operation and focuses on the core essentials. For example he states that it is vitally important to remove oneself from the “every day” world in order to be able to focus on the work, but there are obvious limitations to the duration and degree of this requirement. The important factor, according to Newcomb, is to maintain a cons cious awareness of one’s reaction to what interaction does occur during the day between the practitioner and others and to remain focused on the Holy Guardian Angel. He states that avoiding everything in life “can have deleterious effects on your ab ility to handle the world ...You want to improve your relationship with the world, not destroy it.” 88 One of the important factors emphasised in Newcomb’s version of the Operation is an understanding that the ego is comp rised of multiple cond itioning factors and complexes and that the HGA is engaged in an intimate relationship with the ego. The HGA acts as a stabilising factor for the ego wh ile at the same time it also helps keep its potentially narcissistic perspective in check by forcing the ego to acknowledge something outside its boundaries that po ssesses or symbolises supe rior insight and knowledge: The more you pursue your spiritual practices, the more your ego will complain, object, invoke lazine ss, and generally attempt to swerve you away from your course . Your ego may also fool you into believing it is your Holy Gu ardian Angel, which can bring on delusion... 89 Newcomb suggests that once the individua l chooses to undertake the Operation in a particular manner he or she should stay with the chosen appr oach. Some of the suggested approaches made by Newcomb in clude: yoga (including practices such as ā sana , pr ā n ā y ā ma , mantra , praty ā h ā ra , and dh ā ran ā ), Ceremonial Magick (including   88 Newcomb, 21 st Century Mage , 36. 89 Newcomb, 21 st Century Mage , 58-59."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 143 rituals such as the LBRP and the use and de velopment of “astral” senses), devotion (in a bhakti-yoga sense of surrender to God), 90 sexual techniques, and awareness techniques such as those used in various sects of B uddhism. Once the approach has been selected (and Newcomb suggests trying several until one stands out) it is then applied to the six month Operation. The definition of the four Infernal Princes is altered slightly in Newcomb’s rendition of the Operation. The four Prince s (who correspond to the four elements and therefore operate symbolically on both a macrocosmic and microcosmic level) 91 are not taken to be literal entities but yet they still exist: I am not saying that evil spirits don’t exist, or that they are mere figments of imagination. They certainly do exist, but they happen to be made of the doubts, fears, and delusions of humanity. You could also say that the doubts, fears, and delusions of humanity are made of demons. 92 As Philemon was both part of Jung and yet separate at the same time, so too do we see the HGA and the Infernal Princes me ntioned above functioning in a similar dual capacity. Their presence is “real” in that it can be felt and they can be interacted with in a manner which grants them some level of autonomous existence. Yet that interaction is intimately bound to and influenced by the i ndividual’s life and all that he or she perceives:   90 Newcomb cites Crowley’s Liber Astarté as an outline of how this devotion can be defined. To paraphrase Newcomb, citing Crowley, ther e are seven types of devotion listed in Liber Astarté : 1) confession and supplication, as a slave unto his Lord (awe), 2) an Oath as a vassal to his Liege (fealty), 3) a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent (dependence), 4) an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God (adoration), 5) a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother (confidence), 6) a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend (comradeship), 7) a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress (passion). Newcomb, 21 st Century Mage , 107. 91 Newcomb applies Air (intellect) to Lucifer, Fire (passion) to Leviathan, Water (emotions) to Satan, and Earth (body) to Belial. These demons represent the “n egative”, restrictive, or outright destructive aspects of the elements within the individual.

If you do not, you will find yourself slowly falling under their thrall once more, and you will lose sight of your Angel once again in the mire of worldly fears and pains. 93 Both Bloom’s use of the more traditiona l Operation and Newcomb’s more postmodern reworking (i.e., his “belief is a tool” approach) emphasise the fact that there must be a fundamental transformation in one’s psyche in order to progress on a spiritual level. Bloom emphasises the rather problematic “d estruction of ego” a pproach while Newcomb takes a more holistic approach by focusing on the exploration and re lativisation of the ego’s hegemony through its rela tion with the self (HGA). Since, according to the West ern Esoteric Tradition, th e HGA is connected to the sefira Tiferet on the Tree of Life and Jung equates the self with Tiferet 94 we find an interesting connection between the self and the HGA as re presentatives of balance, wholeness, and superior insight. If we take the HGA to be another term for the self there are obvious connections between Jungian theo ry and those of the Western Esoteric Tradition. However there are also many differences as well, which we shall see in the next chapter. This chapter has outlined several important points. First we looked closely at the definition of Magick as used in this thesis . The definition: “Magick is the Science and Art of changing consciousness, through the me dium of metaphor, in conformity with will” reveals an emphasis on “scientific” activiti es such as observation and recording of subjective and objective experiences. Bala ncing the scientific approach is an   93 Newcomb, 21 st Century Mage , 133. 94 Jung, “Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth”, CW 10 , par. 779."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 145 appreciation for the “art” component of Magi ck. This could be through traditional forms of art or through the practice of ritual and visualisations. Both the scientific and artistic facets of the definition are employed in orde r to change consciousness at will. This undertaking would require an increasing command of one’s own projections, an understanding of one’s limits and boundaries, and a desire to push those boundaries. An addition to the more “traditional” definitio n of Magick was the addition of the term “metaphor”. Each tradition that has used the Tree of Life has used it to represent a symbol of order and unity. It is a place where all the chaos of ex istence can be arranged and experienced, to whatever degree and for whatev er duration, so as to bring the individual into a state of increased levels of consci ousness. Metaphor, whether recognised as such or not, is the binding psychol ogical agent that brings together the individual and the structures of the collective psyche. Simila r to Jung’s experiences with Philemon, the magician seeks out the deeper portions of the psyche through openness to and interactions with the lands cape of metaphor and through rela tionships with metaphorical beings encountered therein. One of the ways to focus or define th e foray into the real ms of metaphor is through training in a Western Es oteric Order such as the Go lden Dawn. Orders usually structure their initiatory process on the pattern of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. As the initiate progresses he or she is given more complicated and presumably more penetrating symbols and rituals to deep en their connection with the metaphoric al/psychological world. The Abramelin Operation is a ritual th at attempts to lead the initiate into a dialogue with his or her Holy Guardian Angel or in Jungian terms, the self. This process"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 146 can take a very different approach depending on the individual’s personality and world- view. Through the process of initiation, the pr actitioner becomes intimately connected to the image of the Tree of Life. The Tr ee takes on an organic and, like any “living” symbol, independent existence in relation to the initiate. The Tree symbolises not only the individual’s lofty, and poten tially inflationary, spiritual goa ls it can also represent a symbol of the individual’s psyche or Soul and the many facets contai ned therein. This psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Trad ition’s understanding of the Tree of Life has several important implicat ions which we shall now explore in more detail. Robert Moore and the Archetype of Initiation The term “initiation” has been employed liberally throughout this chapter. The Western Esoteric Tradition ha s a long history of using the term initiation to imply psycho-spiritual progress and development. Prior to moving onto the next chapter we should take a moment to investigate how “initiation” can be understood from the perspective of analytical psychology through a brief review of Robert Moore’s work. Moore is best known for his work w ith the men’s movement and his popular books on the archetypes of the male psyche as personified through the images of the Magician, King, Lover, and Warrior. 95 In the main, Moore’s research is not relevant to   95 See Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette.

Moore’s in terests lay in an anthropologi cal approach to issues such as sacred space and the role of “elders” with in the structure of in itiation and analytical psychology. In The Archetype of Initiation (and elsewhere) Moore divides the Archetype of Initiation into three phases of consciousness (ordinary consciousness challenged, ordinary consciousness transcended, and ordinary cons ciousness reconstitute d) that are then viewed from ten perspectives (Life Even ts, Eliade, Campbell, van Gennep, Turner, Freud, Contemporary Occultist, Psychot herapy, Worship, and Social Attitude). 96 In this structuralist approach, Moore at tempts to organise disparate forms of information into a cohesive comparative format, as do the Esoteric ists in their use of the Tree of Life. As a brief example of what Moore is attempting we will review the “Contemporary Occultist” and the “Psychothe rapy” perspectives of the Archetype of Initiation.

However, of particular interest in Moore’s thought is the appreciation for the potentially damaging practices of the “Contemporary Occult” tradition. Chronic Liminality and Inflation in the Western Esoteric Tradition The concept, definition, and application of initiation within the Western Esoteric Tradition is based on the best possible outcome for an individual. All things being equal, an Adept (Adeptus Minor, 5=6 and above in the Golden Dawn system) should have experienced certain spiritual and psychologica l episodes, have attained and retained a prescribed amount of knowledge and spiritual wisdom, and still preserve a connection to “the real world.” Moore emphasises two of the most obvi ous psycho-spiritual concerns which could apply to the practitioner within the Western Esoteric Trad ition, namely, chronic liminality and pseudo-initiation, the latter of which can lead to problems such as inflation. In our working definition of Magick we find that “changing consciousness” implies moving from what Moore calls “norma l consciousness” into a liminal state of consciousness. The correlative to the liminal form of consciousness is that there must also be a willed return. A ritual involving astral (metaphoric) travel, for example, can become a trigger for liminal consciousness. However, living perp etually in the astral or having the astral world imposing on the “real” world could be detrimental to the mundane life of the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 149 practitioner. It would be unlikely that Jung would have been able to accomplish as much as he did if he had spent gr eater and greater periods of time with Philemon or if he had been carried away by the visitors who preceded the genesis of the Septem Sermones ad Mortuos . 98 Brief sojourns into the liminal realms of metaphor can help to widen one’s perspective while disenchanting the ego-comp lex of its false sense of autonomy and hegemony. Yet if one is lacking in initia l and basic work, such as initial shadow confrontation, or one is attached to a rigid or overly materialistic view of “reality” then the onset of a liminal state, especially one brought on by the co nstellation of an archetype, could be disconcerting or even da ngerous. Analysis, especially analytical psychology, is one way to safely engage in the r ealm of metaphor and probe deeply into the personal and objective psyche. Als o, if we accept the claims made by the Esotericists, the rituals and training of the Western Esoteric Tradition can also provide a safe and effective atmosphere, assuming the practitioner has been trained properly. Proper training is one of Moore’s great est concerns and he emphasises the necessity of ritual elders. M oore, interestingly enough, sees himself fulfilling this role in his own right. Moore states: Without a ritual elder, the tempta tion to inflation of the ego is inevitable. Inflation presents a problem to anyone who has ever come in contact with the Sacred, an d that includes all of us. The Freudians call it “grandiosity.” If you are not a little inflated, you are too far away from the Sun of the Self. Personally, I worry more about you if you ar e not inflated than if you are. . .I like seeing people who feel alive and impo rtant. People who are really   98 Jung recounts that while working deeply with fantasies he “needed a point of support in ‘this world,’ and I may say that my family and my professional work were that to me.

While this approach is well documented within anthropological works and within Moore’s wo rk, there remains the obvious question of who trained the first elder? While having a ri tual elder within the context of the Western Esoteric Tradition is certainly a benefit it is not deemed absolutely necessary. In some traditions, such as Chaos Magick, it may not even be desirable. A ritual elder can guide the practitione r because the elder is thought to have already experienced much of what the practit ioner would be experiencing. However, to make an a priori assumption that the elder’s experi ence is essential to the psycho- spiritual progression of an indi vidual or that his or her experiences will be identical to the practitioner’s is questionable. From the pe rspective of Jung’s model of the psyche and the process of individuation, th e only guide necessary would be the self. The problem would be, of course, how effectively one perceives and interacts with the self on a conscious level. In this case an elder or an analyst could be helpful though ultimately it is the individual who must pass through the va rious psychological initiations. We shall return to this problem again in Chapter Four when we discuss the ego-self axis. The argument of the necessity of a ritual elder as ide, Moore does make an interesting remark regarding the nature of infla tion and its role in initiation. Aleister Crowley’s writings are filled w ith language that could quite easily (and quite justifiably) be construed as havi ng come from an inflated personality. 100 Yet the   99 Moore, Archetype of Initiation , 80."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 151 more intimate the practitioner becomes with the self and the more fluent he or she becomes with the self’s language of sym bol and metaphor, the more the ego-complex tends to emulate, consciously or unconsciously, the self. 101 If transient, this inflation can act as a source of mana and libido that can be “brought under will” and utilised by the practitioner. The experience can lead to ps ychological and spiritual insights, inspiration, and attainment. However, there is the very real danger that the sw elling of the self’s dynamic energy could envelop the ego-complex in such a manner that the ego assumes that it is the self or god. 102 While the goal of the Esotericist is, in essence, to become more than human 103 they would be attempting to reach that goal through a careful spiritual discipline which would require cons tant vigilance toward the workings of the ego-complex. However, this again implies all things being equal. While the goal may be noble in scope, perhaps the mythic lessons of Icarus should be kept in mind. The Esotericists are aware, in writing if not consistently in action, of the problem of egotism. However, there is a rather disconcerting attitude regarding the “destruction” or “transcendence” of the ego. 104 If we assume for a moment, as some Esotericists do, that there is an individual “t hing” called “ego,” as opposed to a collection or complex of       100 Crowley is not alone in this perceived issue of infl ation. Few Esoteric writers are innocent of grandiose language and claims. Crowley is simply chosen as he is one of the Esotericists where this is most notable. 101 According to Jung “the more numerous and the more significant the unconscious contents which are assimilated to the ego, the closer the approximation of the ego to the self , even though this approximation must be a never ending process. This inevit ably produces an infla tion of the ego...” Jung, CW 9ii , par. 44. 102 Jung refers to this as the “mana-personality” in “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 374-406. We will return to the issue of the mana-personality in Chapter Four. 103 I am thankful to John Dourley for placing this concept in a Jungian context for me. Rather than saying the Esotericist is attempting to become “more than hum an” or “god” we can instead see the Esotericist as pushing to become fully human. While the latter description may be more psychologically palatable than the previous, they are both ultimately expressing very similar goals. 104 For examples of how “ego” is defined and dealt with within the Western Esoteric Tradition see: Regardie, The Tree of Life and The Middle Pillar Ritual , Crowley, The Law is for All (Tempe, AZ: New Falcon Publications, 1996), 93-95, Magick/Liber Aba , The Book of Lies 6 th ed.

We will review, for example, the connection between ego and the external world, the role of the shadow and Shadow Abyss, the nature of the anima and an imus and the complex role of the self and its connection to the Esoteric notion of the Holy Guardian Angel. Chapter Four ends with a summary of the Supe rnal Abyss as a buffer between personal, dualistic transpersonal experience and non-dual tran spersonal psycholo gical experiences. Jung expended a great deal of energy researching alchemy, Spiritualism and Gnosticism, not to mention his forays into the more mainstream forms of religion and spirituality such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Juda ism and Christianity. Were he to have made a more thorough study of th e theories of the Western Esoteric Tradition he may have found another historically parallel example of his own theories. Similarly, if the Esotericists would take more time and patien ce to understand the in tricacies of Jung’s thought, they may be able to s ee that placing the initiatory processes of psycho-spiritual maturation within the human psyche, as opposed to “higher” and less human divine realms, does not diminish the potential va lue or numinosity of their Tradition. Traditionally the Tree of Life has helped to bring ideas and concepts together in novel ways and the following analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life is an attempt to bring into dialogue these two theories of human psycho- spiritual development. In the previous chapters we have dealt with the rather abstract and malleable nature of the sefirot through Jewish, Christian, Hermetic and Western Esoteric Traditions. We have also briefly looked at how Jung employed the sefirot within his writings, usually"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 155 in support of his alchemical ps ychological theories, and at th e definition and structure of the Western Esoteric Tradition. Now we shall look more closely at how the sefirot are defined within the Western Esoteric Traditi on and how we may, in turn, interpret them through the theories of analytical psychology. The Western Esoteric Tree of Life a nd the Process of Individuation: Bringing Two Worlds Together The Tree of Life is, first and foremost, a structure and symbol representing order and interconnectedness between seemingly di sparate objects and attributes. If the sefirot are understood to be metaphorical then we can also see the Tree of Life as an ordering of archetypes. The Tree represents a symbolic mani festation of that which is highly abstract in order that human consciousness may be ab le to glimpse the unde rlying complexity of existence. We have seen that the Tree pr ovided the highly intellectual and somewhat rigid traditions of 12 th century Judaism with a means of intimate and unmediated union with God. The Tree gave seemingly objective verification for the dogma of Christianity while it provided a means to explore the physic al and subtle worlds of the Renaissance. The Tree of the Western Esoteric Tradition fo llows in the path of each of the previous applications by providing a model of a direct link to divinity or ultimate reality, a justification of its own world- view, and a method to explore various modes and levels of psychological, physical and spiritual reality. While each of the aforementioned functions of the Tree can be found within the traditions mentioned, the Western Esoteric Tradition, as an amalgamation of various spiritual sources avoids, for the most part, a rigid adherence to one particular world-view."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 156 As we have seen, the Tree can be applied in various and often conflicting ways. How then can this symbol of order and structure be applied to the paradigm of the psyche as put forward by analytical psychology? Perh aps more importantly, why should we even bother trying? The answer to the latter ques tion is apparent to anyone who is interested in both religion, especially the variou s mystical traditions, and analytical psychology. The symbolic nature and immediacy of experien ce witnessed within the various mystical traditions fosters a religious attitude and ec hoes the processes of the unconscious. Jung saw these tendencies in alchemy, mystical Ch ristianity, Gnosticism, as well as in Kabbalah. Lacking the awarene ss and terminology of the pro cesses of the psyche, these traditions looked to the vocabulary and symbols of their own world-view for explanation. In 1937 Jung delivered a paper for the Terry Lecture entitled “Psychology and Religion.” In that paper Jung se t out to define “religion.” Jung states that religion: appears to me to be a peculiar attitude of the human mind, which could be formulated in accordance with the original use of the term “religio,” that is, a careful cons ideration and observation of certain dynamic factors, understood to be “powers,” spirits, demons, gods, laws, ideas, ideals or whatever na me man has given to such factors as he has found in his world po werful, dangerous or helpful enough to be taken into careful co nsideration, or grand, beautiful and meaningful enough to be devoutly adored and loved.... “Religion,” it might be said, is th e term that designates the attitude peculiar to a consciousness which has been altered by the experience of the numinosum. 1   1 Jung, “Psychology and Religion”, CW 11 , par. 8."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 157 For Jung religion is not solely concerned with dogma or creed, creed being seen by Jung as “codified and dogmatized forms of original religious experiences.” 2 Religion is about the intimate experience of the numin ous which, in Jung’s parlance, is another term for the mysterious power of the unconsci ous: “One must always remember that God is a mystery, and everything we say about it is said and believed by human beings. We make images and concepts, and when I speak of God I always mean the image man has made of him. But no one knows what he is like, or he would be a god himself.” 3 Jung also defines religion in his paper “Psychology and Religion” as: a careful and scrupulous observa tion of what R udolf Otto aptly termed the numinosum , that is, a dynamic agency or effect not caused by an arbitrary act of will. On the contrary, it seizes and controls the human subject, who is always rather its victim than its creator. The numinosum —whatever its cause may be—is an experience of the subject inde pendent of his will.... The numinosum is either quality belongi ng to a visible object or the influence of an invisible presence that causes a peculiar alteration of consciousness. 4 For Jung the religious attit ude is one that has the potential to build bridges between opposites. In Aion , Jung, discussing the contributio ns made by Joachim of Flora (c.1135-1202 CE) towards the ushering in of a “new age of spirit ” found in monastic thought, 5 states that rather than equating Jo achim’s revolutionary insights with the   2 Jung, “Psychology and Religion”, CW11 , par.10.

The second period, “Ordo clericorum”, related to the Son in which humankind lived under the Grace of God, this period ended with the dispensation of the New Testament.

In “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’” Jung recounts a letter written to him by a former patient. In the letter the woman describes a newly found state of mind or attitude. She writes: By keeping quiet, repressing nothi ng, remaining attentive, and by accepting reality—taking things as they are, and not as I wanted them to be—by doing all this, unusu al knowledge has come to me, and unusual powers as well, such as I could never have imagined before. I always thought that when we accepted things they overpowered us in some way or other. This turns out not to be true at all, and it is only by accepting them that one can assume an attitude towards them. So now I intend to play the game of life, being receptive to whatever comes to me, good or bad, sun and shadow forever alternating, and, in this way, also accepting my own nature with its pos itive and negative side s. Thus everything becomes more alive to me. What a fool I was! How I tried to force everything to go according to the way I thought it ought to! 7 The letter offers an example of a religi ous attitude, one that gives birth to a “superior personality”. Jung e quates the birth of the superior personality described by the former patient as the “‘holy fruit,’ the ‘diamond body,’ or any other kind of incorruptible       orders to convert the whole world and usher in the “Ecclesia Spiritualis.” After his death, Joachim’s theories contributed to revolutionary conclusions, notably by certain Franciscans and Fraticelli.

Psychologically, these expressions symbolize an attitude that is beyond the reach of emotional entanglements and violent s hocks—a consciousness detached from the world. I have reasons for believi ng that this attitude sets in after middle life and is a natural preparation for death.” 8 One could argue that this type of transformation is not solely relegated to mid-life. However, what J ung is stressing is that this religious attitude is therapeutic. He states that “all religions are therapies for the sorrows and disorders of the soul. The development of the Western intellect and will has given us an almost fiendish capacity for aping such an attitude, wi th apparent success, de spite the protests of the unconscious.” 9 Jung warns that continued aping and ignoring of the unconscious will lead to a compensatory movement by the unc onscious. This can only be avoided by allowing a genuine religious attitude to surf ace that can bridge both consciousness and the unconscious. 10 The religious attitude was also deemed e ssential in the alchemical traditions. Jung found this fact most aptly reflected in the writings of Dorn. Jung quotes Dorn in a footnote in Mysterium Coniunctionis : “I have thought it right to admonish the disciples to implore divine aid, and [to remind them] of the need for the most careful diligence in preparing themselves for the reception of his grace.” 11 However, the religious attitude is not limited to the few or the esoterically minded. All people, Jung would say, have the capacity for a religious attitude. In “General Problems of Psychotherapy” Jung reveals the importance of the religious attitude within the stru cture of analysis. He states that his aim in analysis is to   8 Jung, “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ”, CW 13 , par. 68. 9 Jung, “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ”, CW 13 , par. 71. 10 Jung, “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ”, CW 13 , par. 71. 11 Jung, CW 14 , par.677, n68, brackets ar e in the original text."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 160 bring about a psychic state “in which my pa tient begins to experiment with his own nature — a state of fluidity, change and growth where nothing is eternally fixed and hopelessly petrified.” 12 Even though this citation seem s to indicate a rather loose approach to analysis, Jung is quick to point out that “I would only like to emphasize that you should not think of my procedure as entirely without aim or limit.” 13 Jung provides room for personal freedom of expression for the patient within the framework of the theories and models of analytical psychology in much the same way the Western Esoteric Tree of Life acts as a loose structure for the me taphorical explorations of the Esotericists. However, even though these internal “subjecti ve” forays into analysis and metaphorical exploration are beneficial, there must al so be a balance between one’s personal experience and a more historical continuity. Jung emphasises that there must be both a personal contemporary consciousness and a supra-personal consciousness “with a sense of histor ical continuity.” 14 Jung states that: However abstract this may sound, practical experience shows that many neuroses are caused primarily by the fact that people blind themselves to their own religious promptings because of a childish passion for rational enlightenment. It is high time the psychologists of today recognized that we are no longer dealing with dogmas and creeds but w ith the religious attitude per se , whose importance as a psychic function can hardly be overrated. 15 For Jung, one’s spiritual tradition could offer essential healing transformations.

This means isolation, and there is no more comforting word for it. Neither family nor society nor position can save him from this fate, nor yet the most successf ul adaptation to his environment, however smoothly he fits in. The development of personality is a favour that must be paid for dearly. But the people who talk most loudly about developing their pers onalities are the very ones who are least mindful of the results, which are such as to frighten away all weaker spirits. Yet the development of personality means more than just the fear of hatching forth monsters, or of isol ation. It also means fidelity to the law of one’s own being. For the word “fidelity” I should pr efer, in this c ontext, the Greek word used in the New Testament, “ πίστις ,” which is erroneously translated “faith.” It really m eans “trust,” “trustful loyalty.” Fidelity to the law of one’s own being is a trust in this law, a loyal perseverance and confident hope; in short, an attitude such as the religious man should have towards God. 17 The above citation resonates with some of the views found within the Western Esoteric Tradition. For example, the empha sis on being “chosen”, the development of one’s own law, or “True Will” in Western Esoteric (specifically Crowley’s) phraseology and the separation from societal norms are ra ther common themes within Western Esoteric   16 Jung, “General Problems of Psychotherapy”, CW 16 , par. 218. 17 Jung, “The Development of Personality”, CW 17 , pars. 294-296."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 162 literature. These issues, and others, will be dealt with below when we look at how the shadow is present within the Western Esoteric Tradition and the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. What we have seen is that a religious attitude, one de void of rigid dogma but with a historical sense of continuity, is an essential part of psycho-sp iritual growth. It is not only necessary but a natural part of the human condition, at least according to Jung. 18 With this new found “religious attitude” in mind and in a manner resembling a squirrel scampering to and fro within the branches, 19 we shall begin our journey on the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. The first part of this chapter is an attempt to place Jung’s understanding of the process of psychological maturation (individ uation) into dialogue with the general structure of the Western Esoteric Tree of Li fe. This dialogue will be accomplished by first reviewing how the Esotericists understand the nature of the various sefirot . Then, aspects of Jung’s model of the psyche will be presented to compare with the Esoteric interpretation of the given sefira . This mutual comparison offers interesting insights into three areas. First, it reveals the potential pitfalls of the Western Esot eric Tradition, as seen from an analytical psychological perspective, such as the apparent lack of shadow confrontation and the risk of the ego identifying with the self which, in turn, leads to infl ation. Second, from the perspective of Western Esotericism, the a pplication also reveals that analytical psychology, as a form of depth psychology, has the means, or perhaps even the   18 For more on Jung’s understanding of the connection between religion and the psyche see: Lionel Corbett, The Religious Function of the Psyche , 4 th ed.

Taken from the perspective of the Western Esoteric Tradition, th ese risks are essen tial for sustained se lf-knowledge. The Western Esoteric Tree of Life not only symbolically reveals th e centrality of the ego-self axis as developed by Jung, it also points to a deeper level of experience that could be interpreted as an e go/self-collective unconscious axis as a metaphor implying a further developmental phase of psycho-spiritual deve lopment, namely the relativisation of the ego-complex within consciousness. Third, th e comparison of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life and analytical psychol ogy reveals that the psyche func tions both in a polytheistic manner, as propounded by Hillman’s early writings and a “self”-regulated manner which reflects a more monotheistic outlook. Before continuing we must review some basic changes and omissions made in the fo llowing analysis of the Tree of Life. Tweaking the Tree: Missing Pieces, Alterations and Modifications First, we should note that two boundaries or buffers called Abysses are being emphasised on the standard model of the Tree. Normally the Western Esoteric Tree of Life is illustrated with only one Abyss, the one separating the Supernal Triad ( Kether , Hokmah , Binah ) from the remaining sefirot . 20 One way this “Supernal” Abyss can be   20 Occasionally three abysses are indicat ed on the Tree. The first is the 32 nd path between Malkut and Yesod . The second abyss, the Veil of Paroketh or the personal abyss falls between Yesod and Tiferet . The Third abyss or the “Great Abyss” falls between Tiferet and Kether . Alta LaDage, Occult Psychology: A Comparison of Jungian Psychology and the Modern Qabalah (St. Paul, MINN: Llewellyn Publications, 1978), 163. While each of these abysses is implied within the Western Esoteric Tradition, only the “Great Abyss” is generally emphasised in the literature."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 164 understood is as th e boundary between rational and trans-rational thought. The other Abyss, rarely emphasised in the literature of the Western Esoteric Tradition, is presented here (falling between Yesod and Malkut ) as a modified version of an Abyss posited by William Gray in his Attainment Through Magic . 21 More about these two Abysses will be discussed later in the chapter. Several concepts that are standard to th e Western Esoteric Tr ee of Life are not analysed in any significant way or they will be altered in this chapter. Most of the omissions are portions of Jewish Kabbalistic philosophy that have been retained by the Western Esoteric Tradition a nd adapted to the Western Es oteric cosmology. One area that will not be analysed are the thre e layers or levels of the human soul: nephesh (animal instinct), ruah (referred to by Esotericists as “higher astral soul”), neshamah (one’s higher spiritual self). Generally, th e three layers are attributed to Malkut / Yesod , the sefirot including and below Hesed and Geburah , and The Supernal Triad respectively. In this application, the baser instincts are located either in Malkut (physical world including inanimate objects) or th e sexual and progenitive Yesod . Ruah represents the various attainable structures of consciousness, while neshamah is the highest spiritual point of the human soul. 22 A second area of omission involves what are known as the Four Worlds. The Tree of Life participates simultaneously within or on four levels of existence. This relationship is symbolised either by placing four trees on top of each other (either individually or intertwi ned in some fashion) or by attributing the sefirot of one Tree into four worlds. The fourth world and the most “dense” is Assiah ( Malkut ). The third world,   21 William Gray, Attainment Through Magic (St. Paul, MINN: Llewellyn Pub lications Inc., 1990), 88-96. 22 For more on the Kabbalistic concept of the soul from an Esoteric perspective see Israel Regardie, The Tree of Life 3 rd ed. (St. Paul, MINN: Llewellyn Publications, 2002), 93-114."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 165 Yetzirah ( Yesod ) corresponds to the astral world and the realm of the angelic beings. The second world is Briah ( Tiferet ) is the world of creation, th e realm of the archangels. Finally, the first world is Atzilut , the pure, archetypal world ( Kether ). 23 The reason for these omissions is merely a matter of simplicit y. The Four Worlds or Four Tree model of the Tree of Life amplifies the complexity of the Tree and the interpenetration of the sefirot in that the Tiferet of Assiah becomes the Malkut of Yetsirah and so forth. Were this thesis a theological study of Kabbalah, the levels of the soul and the Four Worlds would need to be included in greater depth. However, as we are only dealing with the most rudimentary applications of Kabbalis tic philosophy these areas will be left for possible future investigation. One of the problems with some applications of the Tree of Life is the tendency to use rigid definitions and stru ctures when dealing with correspondences. For example, Halevi, although neither an Esot ericist nor a classic Jewish Kabbalist, attempts to place correspondences within a strictly defined Tree of Life built upon “traditional” Jewish Kabbalah. Correspondences are th en arranged or manipulated to conform to that format. This approach adds to the depth and detail of the Jewish Tree of Life but it can detract from the depth and detail of the applied corr espondences. This can be seen clearly in Halevi’s use of psychology and Jungian archetypes. In his book Psychology & Kabbalah , Halevi offers several chapters on Jung and his theories. 24 Halevi makes many claims about th e relationship between Jung’s thought and the Jewish Tree of Life however he never gives reference for his citations. Here is a   23 There are many other ways of attributing the Four Worl ds on the Tree of Life. This is only one example. See Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2000), 23-26 for a brief summary of the Four Worlds. 24 Z’ev ben Shimon Halevi, Psychology & Kabbalah (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1992), 165- 260."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 166 brief example of how Halevi understands and utilises the archetypes (it should be noted that he rarely seems to differentiate between archetype and archetypal image) on the Tree of Life: The major Jungian archetypes, when placed on the Tree, correspond almost exactly, though the terms may be different. For example, Jung’s Great King would be placed in Hesed . His archetype of the Hero is certainly Gevurah , the beautiful maid or youth is without a doubt Nezahian , while the Trickster clearly fits with Hod . These archetypes occur in many guises, but the Great King is always merciful and gene rous and the warrior courageous and discriminating, which are the qualities of Hesed and Gevurah , or the reverse if the dark side of the Sefirot are being invoked. The same is true of all the other archetypes. 25 Halevi attempts to define the archetypes, as opposed to the archetypal images, in terms of the sefirot which essentially confines the dynamic symbolic pattern of the archetype to a convenient category. The Her o, for example, does not only fit within the confines of Gevurah (we have been using the spelling Geburah ). Halevi’s description of the warrior, as an example of the Hero archetype, as being “courageous and discriminating” reflects little of the complexity of that archetype. No mention is made of the Hero’s connection to the unconscious self, 26 the role of holding the tension of opposites 27 ( Geburah resides on the Left Pillar as opposed to the balanced Middle Pillar), the figure of Christ, 28 or the connection to ego consciousness. 29 Halevi’s approach may work when used to explore possible thematic connections between archetypal images and Jewish Kabbalah, but it breaks down if we be gin to make categorical claims about the   25 Halevi, Psychology & Kabbalah , 189-190. 26 Jung, Symbols of Transformation , CW 5 , par. 516. 27 Andrew Samuels et al. , A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis (London, UK: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986), 66. 28 Jung, “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ”, CW 13 , par.79. 29 Edward Edinger, Ego and Archetype (New York: Penguin Books, 1986), 129."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 167 nature of the archetypes per se . The Esotericists tend, for th e most part, to do the same thing when the sefirotic correspondences are taken to be concrete. Attempting to reduce the meaning of the archetypes to the confines of Judaic, Esoteric, or any other world-view unnecessarily limits their dynamic potential. However, the Tree becomes more flexible if the sefirot are looked at from the perspective that they are loose and metaphorical outlines of psychic and symbolic themes. When authors such Halevi or Knight, for example, have used Jung’s model of the psyche they do so in an attempt to place Jung within the context of the Jewish or Western Esoteric Tradition’s understanding of the Tree of Life. Jung’s concept of archetypes and clearly defined structure of the psyche seem to fit well on the Tree. Yet there has been no attempt to offer an analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. 30 By combining Jung’s model of the psyche and the general interpretations of the sefirot as understood within the Western Esoteric Tradition, we have a model that gives structure to the chaos of the unconscious. Yet, by its very nature, this model pushes human consciousness toward a pe rspective of ever widening perception and appreciation of that chaos. There are two “directions” to the Tree of Life. Creation, or separation into multiplicity, follows the Path of the Lightening Bolt. The Path of the Serpent or the Path of Initiation winds its way back toward an original unity. 31 For Dion Fortune, the Path of the Serpent “represents the dawn of objec tive consciousness and is a symbol of   30 At least this is so to the best of my knowledge. 31 As mentioned above, there is also the Path of the Arrow, the mystical Path. However, we will not be entering into an in-depth analysis of that Path as the Path of the Serpent includes the sefirot that comprise the Path of the Arrow but the reverse is not true."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 168 initiation...” 32 yet she indicates too that what was once only accomplished in the past by initiates is today accomplished by the “average man”. 33 Fortune is here referring to, among other things, modern human understandin g of the nature of the psyche and its far- reaching implications in the human condition. She, like the initiates of old and those of present day, sees the apparent split between mind and matter as superfluous. To Fortune, one link between the two realms of mind and matter is psychology: The esotericist ... points out that matter and mind are two sides of the same coin, but there comes a poi nt in one’s investigation when it is profitable to change over one’s terminology, and talk of forces and forms in terms of psychology, as if they were conscious and purposive. 34 In keeping with Fortune’s sa ge advice, we now turn to the language of analytical psychology as a means of understanding the We stern Esoteric Tree of Life and its initiations into the realm of meta phor and psyche; a realm where the sefirot become representative of the proce ss of psychological maturation. The Tree of Life has gone through many ch anges since its earliest application in Judaism. Each transformation stretches or breaks old structures while creating new ones in the process. What follows is an attempt to create a new interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life.

This combination results in the traditional nature and definitions of the sefirot being stretched and transformed (and occasionally distorted). At the same time, the models and definitions found within analytical psychology will be alte red in some minor ways. Personal Perspective and the Material World: Malkut as Ego-Complex Malkut is the last or lowest sefira on the Tree of Life. 36 According to the Esotericists, Malkut’s magical image is of a young wo man, crowned and throned. The titles given to Malkut , terms or phrases that reflect the nature of the sefira , include: The Gate, The Gate of Death, The Gate of the Sh adow of Death, The Gate of Tears, The Gate of Justice, The Gate of Prayer, The Gate of the Daughter of the Mighty Ones, The Gate of the Garden of Eden, the Inferior Mother, Malkah (The Queen), Kallah (The Bride), and The Virgin. 37 In the realm of the human body Malkut is said to correspond to the feet or, alternatively, the anus. 38 The Esoteric symbol of Malkut corresponds to the double-cubed   35 In Psychological Types Jung states that “The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect, but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity.

The spiritual experience of Malkut is the Vision of the Holy Guardian Angel. 39 Each of the symbols listed here all represent an aspect of Malkut . The image of a young crowned woman is juxtaposed with the Supernal Mother Binah whose image is a mature woman, a matron. 40 The daughter, Malkut , though removed from its source is still divine, or rather a receptacle of the divine force of the preceding sefirot . She is less mature though more virile than Her mother. The various titles of Malkut reflect the sefira’s connection to the world. Through Malkut death and sorrow are present and are experienced. Yet the sorrow experienced here is a transitory, mundane one. Binah , the Great Mother, has for its spiritual experience the Vision of Sorrow a nd since Sorrow has a capital letter we can assume it is of a different nature than the sorrow of Malkut . 41 Malkut’s connection to the feet reflects th e notion of grounding or “standing on two feet”. All journeys must begin from here. The second traditional corresponding symbol, the anus, reflects the idea of natura l processes such as e limination of waste, ridding the body, the “Temple of God”, of toxins. Malkut represents the multiplicity of the material world. This is reflected in both the double cubed-altar (representing the linking of microcos m and macrocosm) and the equal-armed cross (the balance of the four elements). However, there is more to the material world than simply what can be seen or measured. The Kabbalists also posit a subtle world that gives form to the materi al world.

When the Magician casts the circle, it acts as a boundary between the external mundane world and the realms of the sacred. The triangle, which is traditionally kept outside of the circle, forcibly confines and restricts th e independence of ethereal entities, again reflecting the notion of conf ining, defining and separating. 43 The base emotions, animal instincts, or simply the physical body and its most basic needs are posited in Malkut . 44 The structure of the ego-complex is posited to Yesod or the Kabbalistic World corresponding to Yesod . 45 However, while this interpretation may sit reasonably well within the loose veneer of Jewish Kabbalah and its hierarchical structure of the soul, it does not take into account the intimate and intricate connection between the ego-complex, the aforementioned baser instincts, and the material world. The ego-complex, like the structure of Malkut , is comprised of various factors, conditions, and functions; it is after all a complex. 46 It is through this complex that we, as individuals, have any conscious pe rception of the material world at all. 47 Without the ego-complex, and a healthy one at that, the ability to perceive and function in the material world can be compromised.

In this way both the objective world and our psychological appreciation and interaction with it is contained in the same sefira and not separated in a dualistic manner. Like understanding the structure a nd dynamic of the ego-complex, the understanding of the material worl d is a fundamental task of th e Esotericist. The material world is where all further personal growth and attainment will be built. The same insistence can be found in Jung’s reading of the alchemical tradition when referring to the reintegration of the unio mentalis with the physical body. 48 While lengthy, this citation from Dion Fortune sums up this issue succinctly: If we try to escape from the discipline of matter before we have mastered the lessons of matter, we are not advancing heaven- wards, but suffering from arrested development. It is these spiritual detectives who flock from one to another of the innumerable wildcat uplift organisati ons that come to us from the Far East and the Far West.

It is something to be understood and engaged in. Only with this firm grounding in place should the deeper structures of the un conscious be voliti onally penetrated.

Other sy mbols traditionally attributed to Malkut reflect the same theme of firmness and “groundedness” and at the same time demonstrate Malkut’s , as with the various component s of the ego-complex, diverse manifestations. Of course the question remains how does th is “remodelled” version of Malkut relate to Jung’s understanding of the ego-complex? For Jung the ego is the centre of cons ciousness and the personality. Part of the ego’s role is to maintain personality, c ognitive functions, and function as mediator between conscious and unconscious portions of the psyche. This would seem to indicate that the ego holds an autonomous, or at leas t a privileged position wi thin Jung’s model of the psyche. However, this is not actually the case. For Jung the ego-complex is the centre of consciousness while the se lf is the centre of the psyche. 50 It would also appear that the ego-complex is entirely present within consciousness. This assumption is also in error. 51 Malkut has its own unique qualities, as indicated by the various symbols and experiences associated with the sefira . It is, at the same time, influenced and shaped by the other sefirot and ultimately unable to exist inde pendent from them. The ego-complex also has its own unique “identity” while at the same time it is influenced by other   50 Jung, Psychological Types , CW 6 , par.706. 51 The ego-complex is also comprised of personal or biographical unconscious factors.

According to Jung th e “ego, the subject of consciousness, comes into existence as a complex quantity which is constituted partly by the inherited disposition (character constituents) and pa rtly by unconsciously acquired impressions and their attendant phenomena.” 52 Both Malkut and the ego-complex participate in the world of the senses and the deeper regions of the psyche. In order to understa nd the function of one sefira we need to look to the others for contrast. Yet in order to experience the other sefirot , or the other portions of the psyche, we would need to be open to the fact that th e ego-complex is not the only reality or the sole means of perception. There are, in fact , many facets to the psyche and the first step to accepting and working with that understanding can be a difficult one as it implies that the conscious boundaries of the ego-complex ar e not certain. Thus, the first Abyss we encounter moving from Malkut marks the initial step away from a strictly defined ego- consciousness towards the shadow and the greater dynamic of the psyche. Shadow: The Personal Abyss 53 As mentioned previously, the placement of an Abyss between Malkut and Yesod is not a common one within the Western Esoteric Tradition; at least it is not common within its more popular litera ture. Before moving on to lo ok at how this first Abyss functions in relation to Jung’s concept of the shadow we must take a moment to clarify   52 Jung, “Analytical Psychology and Education”, CW 17 , par.169. 53 Although we presented the ego-complex first and are now moving onto the shadow we should not assume that this implies a strict orde r or sequence in either the case of individuation or the processes of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life.

In keeping with the them e of shadow confrontation, we will also look at how, from an analytical psychological pers pective, the Western Esoteric Tradition has used the Tree of Life to confront the shadow . There is also a second shadow related to the Tree, based on its cultural roots and hierar chical organisation, which is not as overt. Before recounting what the Abyss is within the Western Esoteric Tradition we should understand what it is not . The term abyss can and has been used in many different contexts in various religions, spiritual trad itions, and philosophies. For some an abyss can be likened to the Dante Alighier i inspired Christian Hell or perhaps Gehinnom of Jewish cosmology. Alternately, and in a less torturous characterisation, perhaps Jacob Böhme’s notion of the divi ne ground of being, the Ungrund , 54 or Hegel’s notion of Spirit and the abyss of the unconscious come to mind. 55 Neither a realm of torment nor the abstract source of reality is implied in our us e of the term Abyss. The former could be aligned with the Kabbalistic notion of the qlippot , while the latter could be understood as the Negative Veils of Existence or the En Sof , neither of which need be addressed presently. 56 The Western Esoteric Tradition views th e Abyss between the Supernal Triad and the remainder of the Tree as symbolic of a momentous and poten tially destructive spiritual, psychological and physical experi ence. Some of the more conservative Esotericists will claim, as did many members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, that only through death could the Abyss be brea ched, or at the very least, it represented an extremely high state of enlightenment for t hose who dwelt on higher (astral) planes of   54 See John Joseph Stoudt, Jacob Boehme (New York: Seabury Press, 1968). 55 For more on Hegel’s contribution to psychoanalysis’ understanding of the unconscious see Jon Mill’s pioneering, though often verbose, The Unconscious Abyss (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002). 56 More on the qlippot below and more on the Negative Veils in Chapter Six (p.282)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 176 existence. 57 However, with Esotericists like Aleister Crowley the Abyss became a psychological and spiritual goal to be pushed for with the utmost of dedication and diligence in this lifetime. 58 With either understanding, the Abyss represents a fundamental shift in perception a nd enduring psychological disposition. Another relevant factor regarding the natu re of the experience of the Abyss is the sense of permanency and irrevocability. The Abyss is thought to mark a position of no return that should not be entertained light ly. In our current application, the Abyss representing the proce ss of shadow confrontation indicate s that the person who looks past the boundaries of ego-consciousness opens a new perspective that includes active engagement in the realms of metaphor and ar chetypal images. This is not to imply that being aware of this new perspective creates the shadow or archetypal images, only that there is a commitment to pursue an alternate form of perception which is actively open to these images. 59 In relation to this new perception is awareness that the factors and experiences that compose the personal and objective psyche cannot be undone once the perspective has been entered—Pandora cannot close the box. Realising one has a shadow or that one’s personal relationships have a component of projection embedded in them is a heavy burden since the “real” world is then understood to have an intrinsic psychic component that can be difficult to understand or to control even under optimal conditions.   57 See Ellic Howe, The Magicians of the Golden Dawn (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1984), 17 and Gareth Knight, A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (York Beach: ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1993), v.

Accordi ng to Gray, all the “exha usted and detrimental thoughts” and the “outworn and useless feelin gs” we harbour act as psychic poison. He continues: “we realize that thoughts and fee lings reduced to such a condition will poison our minds and souls if we do not eliminat e them like their physical counterparts....” 61 Gray then presents some simple exer cises which are to purge the “negative” thoughts and feelings. Rather th an analysing the psychological merit of Gray’s exercises, what we need to observe is that the Aby ss currently in question is that process of elimination and emancipation. When compared to Jung’s model of the psyche, the Abyss can also be seen as parallel to the shadow. Jung states that the shadow (as part of the personal unconscious) “contains lost memories, painful ideas that are repressed (i.e., forgotten on purpose), subliminal perceptions...contents that are not yet ripe for consciousness.” 62 Similar to Gray’s emphasis on the emotional nature of the Abyss, Jung indicates that shadow content has an emotional nature. 63 Experience of the Abyss also appears to be separate from the individual; that is to say it is experienced as a process that the individual objectively participates in rather than an experience that originates intra- psychically. In the same way, projection a nd the corresponding emotional nature of the shadow is not experienced as the activity of the individual; rather it is experienced as something that happens to them. 64 Should the shadow remain unconscious, the equivalent   60 This Abyss is first in the sense that we are working “up” the Tree but second in the sense that the Abyss separating the Supernal Triad from the remainder of the Tree is the “original” or more standard Abyss of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. 61 Gray, Attainment Through Magic , 91. 62 Jung, “On the Psychology of the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 103. 63 Jung, Aion , CW 9ii , par. 15. 64 Jung, Aion , CW 9ii , par. 15."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 178 of psychological poison would c ontinue to amass and could, if left unacknowledged, lead to psychological complications.

In their additions to Israel Regardie’s The Middle Pillar , the Ciceros place   65 In Jung, “Conscious, Unconscious, and Individuation”, CW 9i , par. 513, Jung states that the “shadow coincides with the “personal” unconscious (whi ch corresponds to Freud’s conception of the unconscious)...The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself and yet is always thrusting itself upon him directly of indirectly...” Yet we should be aware that the “personal unconscious” is not comprised solely of the shadow. There are many aspects of the personal unconscious which are not related to the shadow. The personal unconscious also includes “everything of which I know but of which I am not at the moment thinking; everything of which I was once conscious but have now forgotten; everything perceived by my senses, but not noted by my conscious mind...” Jung, “On the Nature of the Psyche”, CW 8 , par. 382. While the term “personal unconscious” is used when referring to the shadow, this does not imply that the shadow=per sonal unconscious. Jung’s use of the term “personal unconscious” tends to be rather difficult to pin down. 66 Jung, Aion , CW 9ii , par. 13. 67 Jung, “On the Nature of the Psyche”, CW 8 , par. 409."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 179 a brief review of Jung’s, along with Assagioli’s, model of the psyche. 68 From The Middle Pillar the Ciceros state that: All of us must face our shadow side . This is especially important for magicians who seek to delve into the inner recesses of the human psyche—the mind of the microcosm. We must discover the distinct characteristics of our shad ow (as opposed to other parts of the psyche such as the ego), a nd recognize it for what it is—a natural part of ourselves and nothing to be ashamed of or feel guilty about. 69 Following this rather terse definition of the shadow, the Ciceros introduce two meditations or exercises. 70 The first, the “Regression Ex ercise,” deals with mentally visualising one’s past in varying increments. Presumably the point of this exercise is to uncover possible past influences that may be affecting one’s current psychological disposition. Following the “Regression Exerci se” the Ciceros give the “Trauma Release Exercise.” The “Trauma Release Exercise” is undertaken alone or in conjunction with another person where one person acts as a f acilitator for the indivi dual partaking in the exercise. The exercise requires the individual to visualise a traumatic event in the reverse order that it occurred in real life, as though one was watching a videotape in reverse and in slow motion. Then the person is directed to view this mental videotape in the “natural order” until he or she arrives at the initial starting point again. This exercise is then repeated, reverse and forward again, until th ere is no longer an emotional connection to the event. The Ciceros suggest the individual repeat this ex ercise over a period of a few weeks.

There is no mention at all regarding the possibility that one may not be prepared for such “regression”. 71 Given the symbolically charged nature of the Western Esoteric Tradition this passive approach to shadow content is somewhat unsettling. However, at the very least and from an an alytical psychological perspective, some mention is made in regards to the importance of shadow integration. As mentioned above, Israel Regardie emphasised that a person who wished to participate in the processes of the Western Esoteric Tradition shoul d be encouraged to enter into some form of psychoa nalysis. However, when this is not possible there is the possibility of working with an Order or group of people. Within the confines of the initiator/initiate relation there is the potentia l that projections or tr ansference can occur in a safe and productive surrounding.

The rituals of the Western Esoteric Tr adition, such as the Lesser Banishment Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP), are generally learned early on a nd employed regularly, thus allowing for the practitioner to slowly build up a sense of security and the sacred within the created neutral and liminal space. The ritual elder would function best in this case not as the purveyor or preserver of sacred space, as Moore indicates, but as one who can monitor and interpret what occurs to the practitioner on a psychological level while engaged in ritual practice.

One shadow is openly acknowledged, encouraged (at least in some circles), and utilised, while the other sha dow remains obscure. In a play on Masonic mythology and terminology we shall refer to these shadows as the Tree’s “operative” shadow, one that is acknowledged and analysed within the Tradition, while the other shadow, the “clandestine” shadow, is one th at is far less acknowledged by practitioners and thus has the capacity and potential to be more problematic. Let us first look at the operative shadow of the Tree of Life. The operative shadow, for our purposes, can be seen as a development or result of the Western Esoteric Tradition’s attempt, consciously or unconsciously motivated, to acknowledge the shadow component of the unive rse and the individual psyche’s place in that universe. There are three obvious areas within the Western Esoteric Tradition that could be seen as dealing with, to some degr ee, what Jung termed the shadow. The first area is the practice of Goetic Magick, the s econd is the Abramelin Operation and the third is found with the Tunnels of Set and th e Tree of Death propounded and developed by Kenneth Grant. 76 The demons of Goetia, as understood by Crowley and others as being part of the mind, represent objectified portions of the personal unconscious. 77 Traditionally these   76 We could also include here the various types of Ch aos Magick as much of the techniques and concepts from within this “tradition” could be seen as confronting specific shadow issues such as gender constructs, personality constructs...any construct really. The motto of Chaos Magick— “Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted”—reflects the potential for sh adow confrontation and integration. 77 See Mathers (trans.), Crowley (ed.), The Goetia (ME: Samuel Weiser, 1995), 17-19 and Crowley, The Magical Record of the Beast 666 (London: Gerald Duckworth & Co.

The magician, working through the demon(s), could raise armies and find treasure, castles, and horses. At the same time the demon could be called upon to teach the magi cian the humanities, sciences, languages, and all the secrets of the universe. Perhaps one way these practices can aid in understanding shadow is by asking the question why a person would need to or desire to call upon these demons. What is it that the person is incapable of doing without such supernatural agencies and what are the ps ychological roots of that incapacity? If the demons were called upon in a manner similar to active imagination and allowed to manifest in a type of ritualised fantasy, the demons would become much more useful from a psychological perspective. Rather than being confined by the boundaries of objective and literal ex istence, the demons become meta phors of psychological processes and conditions. Their original structured hierarchical existence would become part of the flexible and fluid realm of metaphor inst ead of remaining locked in an antiquated cosmological paradigm. An interesting juxtaposition in regard s to the skills offered through the Goetic demons is the fact that ab stract intellectual functions such as knowledge, for example knowledge of the humanities or the secrets of the universe, is placed alongside seemingly unrefined “this worldly” activit ies such as war, accumulation of wealth (including stores of women—obviously the demons or the ma gicians were/are gender biased) and the control of the weather. The demons seem to bridge the gap between intellectual (mind) and mundane (body) pursuits. This juxtapos ition is also evident in the manner the demons tend to be portrayed. We can see, either from the written descriptions or from illustrations (such as those given in the Mathers and Crowley version of The Goetia ), that"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 184 most of the demons are portrayed as humanoi d and theriomorphic or as a humanoid with an animal mount or companion. This combin ation would seem to re flect an attempt at bringing both the human and animal natures together. The demons of The Goetia reflect the same neither / nor logic which is evident in the realms of metaphor. The Goetia is not the only place where demonic entities are en countered within the Western Esoteric Tradition. We have already reviewed a nother ritual undertaking where the demonic hierarchy is addressed. The Abramelin Operation offers the s econd obvious area of shadow confrontation within the Western Esoteric Tradition. As indicated by Jason Newcomb, the “Four Evil Princes” (Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial and Satan) must be conquered or else there remains the risk that they might, once again, gain autonomous psychological power. However, this confrontation occurs onl y after one has gain ed “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.” In Jungian terms th is would be like approaching the shadow only after some conscious rapport ha s been secured with the self or ego-self axis. The likelihood of the individuation process continui ng in a meaningful manner without initial shadow work being undertaken is problematic. Yet, if we assume that such preliminary work is already in process, especially if done in the manner suggested by Regardie, i.e. through some form of psychoanalysis, we are left with a different possibility. Instead of viewing the “F our Evil Princes” as part of the personal shadow, as repressed drives, complexes or experiences , we can see them as metaphors of the collective human shadow. For Jung, shadow work, like the process of individuation, is never complete and it is not only our pers onal shadow which must be addressed and tended; there is also the collective root of the shadow. According to Jung:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 185 None of us stands outside human ity’s black collective shadow.

In fact, this negligence is the best means of making him an instrument of evil. 78 In his “On the Psychology of the Tricks ter-Figure” Jung again refers to the collective nature of the shadow. In discussi ng folk traditions a nd carnivals Jung states that: We are no longer aware that in carnival customs and the like are remnants of a collective shadow figure which prove that the personal shadow is in part descended from the numinous collective figure. This collective figure gr adually breaks up under the impact of civilization, leaving traces of folklore which are difficult to recognize.

By knowing one, we may assume, we can learn the nature of the other. The Four Princes, when ritually and metaphorically objectified, can represent a personal contact with the collective shadow of our human psychic legacy. This legacy raises questions like: “Where does the collective capacity to destroy races of people come from?” or “Why is it th at nations are led into conflict after conflict in a seemingly effortless manner?” Answer ing these questions from an individual, psychological, perspective might include ex planations of personal disassociation or psychological development, Oedipal complex, se xual abuse, or whatever aspect of the psyche is too painful to engage in consciously and is consequently repressed or projected onto others.

How can one really expect to “ know thyself” without such “imagination for evil” no matter how brief it may be? 80 With these rhetorical questions posited, let us analyse the thir d operative shadow of the Tree of Life. Kenneth Grant (b.1924) is perhaps best known for his development and exploration of the “Tunnels of Set.” In Liber CCXXXI 81 , Aleister Crowley presented a listing of demonic entities that stand in contra distinction to the more angelic beings of the sefirot . 82 This concept was then elaborated on by Kenneth Grant in his work Nightside of Eden . 83 The twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life are thought to co-exi st with the twenty- two “Tunnels of Set” of the Tree of Death. The Tunnels of Set represent an alternate reality of non-being which can be reached through the pseudo- sefira Da’at . Grant, following his own idiosyncratic interpretation of tantra also equates the Tunnels of Set with the twenty-two types of etheric vaginal secretions or kalas found during rites of “Tantric” intercourse. 84 Though not widely accepted within the Western Esoteric Tradition, Grant’s theories reveal again the idea of bringing to the fore aspects of psychic life usually left   80 For more on the shadow and politics, another fo rm of collective shadow, see Andrew Samuels, The Political Psyche (London, UK: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1993), 15-18. 81 Aleister Crowley, The Equinox, vol.I, no.vii (Deluxe facsimile ed.

Some of the writings of Isaac Luria deal with the “shards” of the sefirot that need to be mended. Crowley simply helped to make this “underside” of the sefirot a viable practice within th e Western Esoteric Tradition. 83 Kenneth Grant, Nightside of Eden , 2 nd ed.

Orders such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn regard ritual initiations as being a type of death, perhaps the most overt ritual example being the Golden Dawn initiation for the Adeptus Minor (5=6) grade where the initiate is bound to a “cross of suffering” and then released in a symbolic ge sture of spiritual rebirth. 86 Despite this ritual nod toward death and suffering, there still tends to be an overemphasis on the rebirth portion of transformation to the diminution or exclus ion of the death portion within Western Esoteric literature and ritual. However, in the interest of balance, we should note that Grant’s understanding of the Western Esoteric Tradition is a minority view since he emphasises the importance of contacting currents or entities from Sirius, the Star of Set—a theory that dominates Grant’s work. 87 While Grant may be “as fascinati ng and ultimately mystifying as a giant squid in a cocktail dress” 88 , he does represent one of th e few Esotericists who, through engaging in the operative shadow of the Tree of Life, address (perhaps unconsciously) some of the issues reflected in what we are labelling the “c landestine” shadow of the Tree of Life of the Wester n Esoteric Tradition.   85 In his article “Trafficking with an ‘onslaught of compulsive weirdness: Kenneth Grant and the Magickal Revival” Dave Evans indicates that when Grant published the concept of the Tunnels of Set reactions were extreme. Evans cites two summations of Grant and the Tunnels of Set. Gerald Suster (best known as a biographer of Aleister Crowley and Israel Regardie) stated the Grant was “ignorant... perverted... Tunnels of Set? Sewers of shit... those who accept Grant’s statemen ts ... are eating his used lavatory paper.” On the other hand, Grant can be seen as a pioneer, especia lly in the 1970’s when he was “practically alone in offering new contributions to the literature of magick.” See: Dave Evans, “Trafficking with an ‘onslaught of compulsive weirdness: Kenneth Grant and the Magickal Revival” in Dave Evans ed., The Journal for the Academic Study of Magic , 2, (Oxford: Mandrake, 2004), 239. 86 Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn (St. Paul, MINN: Llewellyn Publications, 1988), 221-247. 87 Kenneth Grant, Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God (London: Frederick Muller Ltd., 1973). 88 Cited in Evans, “Trafficking with an ‘onslaught of compulsive weirdness’”, 259."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 188 The Tree of Life is a symbol of spir itual progression, integration, and psychic potency. However, the Tree is not withou t its own innate shadow and through the acknowledgment of this shadow we can come to better understand some of its more deeply repressed and buried assumptions and bring them to the light of consciousness. While it may be rather contrived to focus on only a few clandestine shadow issues it should suffice to give us a better understand ing of two key components of this shadow: the Tree’s gender bias and its hierarchical st ructure that can lead to the possibility (probability?) of inflation. The Western Esoteric Tree of Life is communicated through gender-biased language. 89 We see that the “feminine pillar” li es in opposition to th e “masculine pillar” and we see an emphasis on stereotypical imag es of both male and female. For example we see a limited view of feminine symbols in Malkut , Netzach , and Binah . Malkut is virginal while Netzach is seductive and sexual and Binah , the Great Mother (or the Whore of Babalon [ sic ] in Crowley’s cosmology), is bot h devouring and liberating. It would appear that the definition and extent of “feminine” is reduced to birth, death, sex, or virginity. The masculine images ar e equally stereotypical. For example, Gebubrah , the Martian warrior, is, as would be expected, represented by a muscular man. Tiferet , a sefira of balance and equilibrium is symbolised by a child, a majestic king or a sacrificed god—all of which, given the context, are male.   89 Scholem mentions this issue, in rather sexist language of his own, in Major Trends is Jewish Mysticism : “One final observation should be made on the general character of Kabbalism as distinct from other, non- Jewish, forms of mysticism. Both historically and metaphysically it is a masculine doctrine, made for men by men. The long history of Jewish mysticism shows no trace of feminine influence. There have been no women Kabbalists...[Kabbalah] therefore lacks the element of feminine emotion which has played so large a part in the development of non-Jewish mysticism, but it also remained comparatively free from the dangers entailed by the tendency towards hysterical extravagance whic h followed in the wake of this influence.” Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Shocken Books, 1973), 37."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 189 The Esotericists can simply claim that the gender assigned to the Tree is one of symbolic representation of alternating polarity and not to be taken literally. They can also claim, following Jewish Kabbalistic philosophy, that each sefira contains every other sefira thereby negating the gender exclusive repres entation. So then what are we to make of the gender specific terminology of the Tree of Life and what can be done about it? One answer is that we should acknowledge this stereotypical imbala nce as providing an opportunity to explore the hi dden shadow of the Tree. The Tree of Life exists due to a pl ay between force and form, a dynamic of internal tension that can never be ultimately resolved (unle ss, following traditional Jewish Kabbalah, the Tree is repaired and we enter into a state of tikkun or cosmic repair found in Luranic Kabbalah and in that case the Tree, i.e. existence, would presumably take on a wholly novel form). Rather than view the Pi llars as masculine or feminine, or think of this or that sefira as masculine or feminine, we can think in terms of force, form and equilibrium. The symbols traditionally applied to these states help us to realise how embedded these gender issues are within Ka bbalah and within the Western Esoteric Tradition. Instead of trying to purge the Tree of these symbols or attempting to ignore the gender issues, we can view th e correspondences of the Tree and sefirot to be psycho- spiritual symbols or signposts of transformation, as they are used within the Western Esoteric Tradition, while also analysing them more fully to understand and penetrate the gender bias endemic to the Tradition. By acknowledging and consciously working with and analysing the gender biased nature of the Tree, as oppos ed to repressing or ignoring it, we are able to reach a deeper and more balanced understanding of the Tree."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 190 One issue with the hierarchical structure of the Western esoteric Tree of Life is the potential of inflation. As is probably self-evident, the Golden Dawn initiatory grade structure reviewed in Chapter Three has such a potential. The Neophyte starts off with or as nothing, (0=0). 90 The Zelator gains one part of something but 10 parts missing (1=10) while the Theoricus (2=9) has gained another segment of the missing something over and above the Zelator and two over the Neophyte. The discrepancy in le vels is where the problem lies and which happens to be the poten tial source of inflation. The grades, as symbols of both ceremonial and transformative initiations, are intended to reflect one’s experiences and personal attainments. If, however, the grades begin to represent closeness to perfection or act as a measure of spiritual purity, over and above those of a lesser grade, then the abuse of power becomes more likely. A rather simplified analogy may be taken from the world of martial arts. Various belt colours are used to represent one’s martial skill level. This differentiation helps to avoid lopsided sparring matches (for example a 3 rd degree black belt sparring with a white belt) and to enco urage interaction within one’s peer group. It is not meant to segregate the higher belts from the lower but to facilitate more effective learning for all involved. However, if taken as a symbol of one’s martial prowess or, worse, one’s personal worth, the “belt” can become a means to set boun daries between oneself and others who lack the appropriate coloured belt . Not only can there be a lopsided view of those of lower rank there can be a tendency to view those of a superi or rank as potential threats rather than valuable resources.   90 A person outside of the Order would be of an even less of a standing! We should also be aware that different Orders will apply different initiatory weight to the grad es. For example, for Crowley’s Order there is a Probationer pre-grade with Neophyte being 1=10.

In this type of infl ation or arrogance one wholly identifies with the myth of their in itiation and spiritual transitions. For Jung inflation: should not be interpreted as ... conscious self-aggrandizement. Such is far from being the rule. In general we are not directly conscious of this condition at all, but can at best infer its existence indirectly from the symptoms. Th ese include the reactions of our immediate environment. Inflation magnifies the blind spot in the eye. 91 The unconscious plays a pivotal role in Jung’s de finition of inflation and is also relevant to our discourse. If both ceremonial and transformativ e forms of initiation occur simultaneously then perhaps unconscious psyc hic energy is released and constellated through the transformative ini tiation which could then lead to inflation manifesting through the ceremonial, i.e. the actual ritual in itiation. If the unconsci ous is not activated by the initiation then what transformative power can it really have? We will return to inflation and Jung’s use of the term “mana-pers onality” when we review the nature of the self and Tiferet below. This brief diversion into the shadows of the Tree of Life was intended to draw attention to the fact that certain shadow oriented issues, the operative shadow, are explored within the Western Esoteric Traditio n (for example issues of death, decay, and sexuality in relation to spiritual developmen t). As a spiritual symbol or metaphor, the Tree of Life is held to be positive and spir itually affirming.

Rather than abandon the Tree we can look at the clandestine shadow as a means to encourage analysis of these issues as they are found in the traditions and philosophies related to the Tree of Life and on a personal or individual level when these traditions and philosophies are put into practice. The shadow Abyss is a necessary ini tiation, a step toward wider and more inclusive forms of consciousne ss. The first Abyss to be encountered on the Western Esoteric Tree of Life demands the difficult and painful task of introspection and self- honesty, not to mention that the shadow Abyss is a test of one’s pers onal resolve. Once the shadow has been brought to consciousness, at least in the sense that the shadow is recognised and it is understood that process will continue for the remainder of one’s life, we move to the second sefira of the Tree of Life, Yesod . Yesod : Symbols, Soul and Libido. The following interpretation of Yesod does not readily conf orm to either the Western Esoteric Tradition’s or the traditional Jewish interpretation of the sefira . In our analytical psychological interpretation of the sefirot , Yesod plays an important and complicated role, one that resonates with J ung’s notion of symbols, soul and libido.

Israel Regardie echoes Fortune’s statement in his A Garden of Pomegranates . While expounding on the nature of Yesod Regardie states that “[s]ome writers have referred to the astral light which is the sphere of Yesod as the Anima Mundi , the Soul of the World. The psychoanalyst Jung has a very similar concept which he terms the collective unconscious which, as I see it, differs in no wise from the Qabalistic idea.” 93 The Ciceros also posit a similar perspective that is evident in the portion of Pomegranates added by them for the 2002 edition of Re gardie’s work. In that section we find the Ciceros discussing the benefit of practic es such as skrying to penetrate the astral plane. They state: “Through these experiences, the magician is able to reach the deepest levels of what Carl Jung called the collective unconscious or what Hermetic philosophers called Anima Mundi —the Soul of the World.” 94 However, equating the entire collective unconscious with Yesod is rather reductionistic and lim ited. The potential of both power and meaning of the collective unconsci ous cannot be relegated to a single sefira , no matter how elegant the placement may appear . What we could say is that Yesod is the gateway to the unconscious but not the collective unconscious in its entirety.

Taken from a psychological perspec tive though, the unconscious is represented by the entire Tree and beyond, as we shall see. James Hillman’s understanding of “soul” is quite descriptive in connection to the relation between Yesod and symbols. In Re-Visioning Psychology , Hillman outlines three qualifications used to define ‘s oul’. All three correlate with Yesod in some way but it is the third qualification which resonates best with Yesod ’s connection with symbol and metaphor: And third, by ‘soul’ I mean the imaginative possibility in our natures, the experiencing through reflective speculation, dream, image, and fantasy – that mode which recognizes all realities as primarily symbolic or metaphorical. 95 Rather than “being” soul or “the soul” in a metaphysical sense, Yesod represents the perspective of becoming aware of a different way of perc eiving the world around oneself. As Hillman states in reference to soul, “By soul I mean, first of all, a perspective rather than a substance, a view point toward things rather than a thing itself.” 96 This same attitude of perspective over substance should also be applied to the nature of each sefira and the entire Western Esoteric Tree of Life. For Hillman soul is another term for psyche and while Yesod may not represent the entire psyche it does symbolise a further shift in consciousness towards an appreciation of the metaphorical depths of the psyche. According to the Esotericists Yesod or “Foundation” is Lunar yet it is symbolised by a “beautiful” strong man. 97 Yesod simultaneously corresponds to the moon, a traditionally and stereotypically “feminine” planet, and the “masculine” symbol of a   95 James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology (New York: Harper and Row, 1975), x. 96 James Hillman, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account (Dallas, TX: Spring Publications, 1988), 16. 97 This is contrary to the Kabbalistic/alchemical sources used by Jung that claim it is Malkut that is lunar: Jung, CW 14 , par. 19."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 195 strong man. The Esotericists, like Dion Fortun e, imply that this seemingly dichotomous schism is due to the fact that Yesod is the receptacle of the substance of the other sefirot and is “the immediate and only tran smitter of these emanations to Malkuth , the physical plane.” 98 Yesod synthesises both the “masculine” pillar of Hokmah , Hesed , and Netzach (pillar of force) and th e “feminine” pillar of Binah , Geburah , and Hod (pillar of form). Obviously this understanding of Yesod is infused with gender bias. However, the sefirot and their contrary correspondences actually work to collapse gender stereotypes. Yesod , as the repository of unconscious symbolism, is the first indication that the polarity of the Tree of Life is, in fact, a representation of “difference” and “otherness” present in the very nature of the unconscious. Metaphorical symbols reflect an intimate “otherness” that is at once familiar and connected to individual ego consciousness yet exists independently from the conscious motivations of the ego-complex. Yesod is emblematic of the metaphorical “stuff” the unconscious moulds into symbolic images which are then perceived on a personal conscious level through the ego-complex and Malkut . Traditionally Yesod is said to be composed of an actual substance that is thought to participate in bo th mind and matter. This substance is known as “Astral Light.” 99 The Astral Light is what perpetuates, permeates, and animates matter on the physical pl ane. This vital energy exchange could be seen as the source behind Yesod’s spiritual vision, “The Mach inery of the Universe.” Yesod is the power and structure behind the perc eption and perpetuation of reality which, since Yesod channels and condenses all the previous sefirot , is infused with divine, i.e. unconscious, energy.   98 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 237. 99 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 237."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 196 For our purposes Yesod can also be seen as symbolic of the balanced state of the anima/animus or the “inner” and archetypal “other” within the psyche. In Yesod the “other” is experienced in a state of equilibr ium. Following a simplified interpretation of the sefirot we could view a “negative” anima/ animus experience as an unbalanced experience of either Netzach or Hod respectively. 100 The psychological “other” in Yesod complements biological sex, represented through the ego-complex. The anima, Netzach , links to Yesod via the 28 th Path while the animus links to Yesod via the 30 th Path. With Yesod the ego-complex ( Malkut ) experiences the anima/animus as a contra-sexual source of potential psychic energy; that is to say, it is differentiated yet balanced. In his lectures on Kundalini Y oga, Jung equates the anima with kundalini . 101 This connection implies a definite sexual connotation that is equally present in Yesod . As the synthesis of both Hod (Mercury) and Netzach (Venus), Yesod represents a conjoining of opposites (actually a double joining as Hod as masculine resides on the “feminine” pillar while the feminine Netzach dwells on the “masculine” pillar). Taken to be somewhat parallel to the Hindu understanding of the m ū l ā dh ā ra-chakra 102 , Yesod is, on a microcosmic or individual level, the seat of the Esotericist’s power or his or her vital or life energy. 103 This energy is then augmented by the joining of vari ous opposing forces such as Netzach and Hod and the material world ( Malkut ) with the depths of the psyche ( Tiferet ).

It is the paring of the anima and animus. 104 The anima and animus function “a s a bridge or d oor, leading to the images of the collective unconscious....” 105 Similarly, Jung tells us that “[w]ith the archetype of the anima we enter the realm of the gods...everything that the anima touches becomes numinous—unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magical.” 106 It is with this understanding of the syzygy, where the anima is the archetype of life and the animus is the archetype of meaning 107 , which we apply to Yesod .

Jung asks the question, in this case directed to ther apists but this ques tion is equally relevant to non-clinicians, what kind of mental or moral attitude is necessary to have to wards the disturbing influences of the unconscious and how can it be conveyed? 114 The answer, according to Jung, is to remove the separation between c onscious and unconscious and to recognise the significance of the contents of the uncons cious in compensating the one-sidedness of consciousness. 115 Dreams are traditionally the most direct way in which the unconscious and conscious factors that make up the transcen dent function can be observed.

The method of development would require what Jung calls “sys tematic exercise for eliminating critical attention.” These methods, wh ich can be found in most fo rms of the Western Esoteric Tradition, cause a “vacuum in consciousness. ” Once this vacuum has been created any libido-charged fantasy waiting to become conscious can surface.

The very fa ct that since the subject of the practice is structured and prearranged to some degr ee, as opposed to bei ng based on unconscious material such as dreams or waking fantasies, implies that critical attention is brought to bear in the contents of the fantasy and that this will ultimately diminish their usefulness. However, as mentioned above, the combination of conditioning and training along with the various ritual drivers common to the West ern Esoteric Tradition, the influence of the critical attention would be, we can assu me, reduced enough for the unconscious to surface within the liminal space created with in the boundaries of the circle, or in psychological terms, the psyche. The transcendent f unction falls under the neither / nor logic of the subtle body of metaphor. Once the unconscious is given an outlet for experience and expression, the ego and the unconscious are brought together and the transcendent function is produced. 120 The question now becomes what does one do with this new found connection with the unconscious? As a clinical exercise this question would be answered within the context of the prac tice of analysis. Whatever the answer is from within analysis, the ego must be placed in a bala nced compensatory position to the unconscious.   119 As stated in Chapter One “A Brief Word on Microcosm and Macrocosm”, (p. 36) Jung equates the macrocosm with the external world while the microcosm consisted of the psyche including the collective unconscious.

In the same way th at the ego suppressed the unc onscious before, a liberated unconscious can thrust the ego aside and overwhelm it.” 121 Jung was well aware of the dangers of opening the way to the unconscious. He also knew that while “aestheticization” and intellectualisation coul d be applied against the affects of the transcendent function, th ey should only be applied when there was a “vital threat” and not to avoid the necessary task of bringing the unconscious into consciousness. 122 By accepting the unconscious into one’s psychological life one also accepts and grants validity to the psychological “other” in whatever form it may take. By acknowledging the “other” within us we are one step closer to acknowledging the “other” without. Or to revers e it: “Everyone who pr oposes to come to terms with himself must reckon with this basic problem [i.e., allowing the “other’s” argument or position to count as valid].

Nor should we assume that it implies a subservient abandonmen t of will or identit y. We should, instead, think of what James Hillman calls “psychological faith.” 125 The Tree of Life, as a psycho-spiritual metaphor and sy mbol, requires that a certain amount of trus t, a certain proportion of faith be applied to the reality and cont ents of the psyche. For Hillman the development of the psyche is equivalent to “soul-making.” Hillman states that: Since psyche is primarily image and image always psyche, this faith manifests itself in the belief in images: it is “idolatrous,” heretical to the imageless monotheisms of metaphysics and theology. Psychological faith begins with the love of images , and it flows mainly through the shapes of persons in reveries, fantasies, reflections, and imaginations. Th eir increasing vivification gives one an increasing conviction of having, and then of being, an interior reality of deep signifi cance transcending one’s personal life....Psychological faith is reflected in an ego that gives credit to images....Its trust is in the imagin ation as the only incontrovertible reality, directly presented, immediately felt. 126 While Jung does emphasise taking the unc onscious seriously he also emphasises that it “does not mean taking it literally, but it does mean giving th e unconscious credit, so that it has a chance to co-operate w ith consciousness instead of automatically disturbing it.” 127 Yet, as we shall see in the case of the Western Esoteric Tradition, the realm of the unconscious and meta phor needs to be made as r eal and literal as possible, especially in regards to the cr ossing of the Supernal Abyss.   125 Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology , 50-51. 126 Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology , 50. 127 Jung, “The Transcendent Function”, CW 8 , par. 184."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 204 Now that we have a cursory understanding of the dynamic between Yesod , Netzach , and Hod and we have seen how the tr anscendent function relates to Yesod we shall move to the next important sefira on our analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life, Tiferet . Tiferet: The Sun, Son, and Self The term “self” has not been a static one in Jung’s thought and we should take a moment to review how this concept has de veloped. First we sh all review Warren Coman’s “Models of the Self” then we shall turn to Gary V. Hartman’s “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology: The Early Years, 1900-1935.” Warren Colman brings to the surface seve ral important points regarding the self in Jung’s thought. Colman begins the article by highlighting the problem of the term “self” as parallel to the idea of “I” or “myself”: Jung’s thinking on the self is full of complexities, paradoxes and uncertainties, many of which are inhe rent in any attempt to discuss something which, by definition, tran scends human comprehension. It is perhaps inevitable that he used ‘the self’ to refer to several different but overlapping concepti ons, just as ‘the God-image’, which Jung regarded as indistinguishable from the self, has a potentially infinite range of meanings. 128 Once it is established that Jung’ s understanding of the self is not equated to the idea of “myself” Colman considers three aspects of th e Jungian self and posits a fourth: the self as the totality of the psyche, the self as an archetype and the self as personification of the   128 Warren Colman, “Models of the Self” in Eliphis Christopher and Hester McFarland Solomon, eds. Jungian Thought in the Modern World (London: Free Association Books Ltd., 2000), 4."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 205 unconscious. The fourth aspect, proposed by Co lman is the self as the process of the psyche. 129 When the self is considered as the totality of the psyche there is an implication that the self contains both unconscious cont ents such as the archetypes and conscious aspects such as the ego-complex. The experien ce of wholeness and/or the God-image, as direct experience or symbol, comes from the self. 130 However, the experience of this wholeness is not representative of the totality of the wholene ss. “These moments offer an intimation of wholeness, an incontrovertible in kling of a psychic totality that remains forever out of reach and unknowable.” 131 The self as archetype presents a few problems. Colman cites Fordham in the discussion of self as archetype. 132 According to Colman, Jung refers to the self as both the totality of the psyche and an archetype within the totality. However if the self is the totality of the psyche containing all other archetypes then how can it also be one of them? “Further more, as an archetype, the self ca nnot be the totality since it excludes the ego which perceives it and is structured by it.” 133 Colman points out that this is an important argument against the notion of the archetypes being in the psyche. Inst ead, “[a]rchetypes are better thought of as modes of experiencing, tendenc ies to experience the world and ourselves in particular ways. This enables us to recognise the dual nature of archetypes: they generate particular symbo lic images but these images al so refer to specific psychic functions.” 134 Colman reminds us that in Jung’s la ter writings he “came to think of the   129 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 4. 130 Colman gives examples of this aspect of the self: Negative Theology, the Unmoved Mover, En Sof , the work of Maimonides and Meister Eckhart and Zen koans . Colman, “Models of the Self”, 6-7. 131 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 6-7. 132 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 7. 133 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 7. 134 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 7."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 206 self as the archetype of the ego. He seems to have recognised that the sharp distinction between ego and self could not always be maintained since the more individuated one becomes, the closer the conscious ego appr oximates to psychic wholeness (although this is an ever-receding goal).” 135 The self can also be seen as the personification of the unconscious. This understanding is reflected in Jung’s Answer to Job 136 where “Job’s conflict with Yahweh [is] a metaphor for the relations hip between the ego and the self.” 137 In this case though, Yahweh, as a symbol of the self “is more like a personification of the elemental powerhouse of the unconscious while Job repr esents the puny but essential forces of consciousness.” 138 This view of the self has influenced the theories of both Erich Neumann 139 and Edward Edinger 140 “in which ego development is seen as a progressive emergence and differentiation from th e self (equated as the unconscious).” 141 This theory, Colman points out, is difficult to reconcile with the theory that the ego is both part of the self and, during the process of individuation, becomes more like the self. 142 Colman presents a fourth interpretation of the self: the self as process. In this theory the self is both an archetype of the ps yche and the totality, as well as being both the organising principle and that which is or ganised. “In this view the self is best understood as the overall process of the psyche. That is, it is not simply an organising principle within the psyche but is better thought of as the organising principle of the   135 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 8. 136 Jung, “Answer to Job”, CW 11 , pars. 560-758. 137 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 9. 138 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 9 139 See Eric Neuman, The Origins and History of Consciousness (London: Karnac, 1989). 140 Edward Edinger, “The ego-self paradox” in Journal of Analytical Psychology , 5(1), 1960, 3-18. 141 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 9 142 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 9."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 207 psyche.” 143 Colman’s view proposes that the “self is both the tendency towards organisation (the process of individuation) and the structure of that organisation (the self as archetype).” 144 As we can see the term self is a diffi cult one to define. If we apply Colman’s view of the self as process to Tiferet we have an alternative understanding of how the sefira can be interpreted. Perhaps Tiferet (and the other sefirot as well—especially those that constitute the self mandala mentione d below) should not be thought of as some thing on the Tree of Life. It is not a point of manifestation but a po int of perspective. The self can be seen as an archetype separate from the psyche when it is experienced or viewed that way. Yet despite these experiences and th e theories that can be drawn from them we are not in a position to make ontological assu mptions about the whole psyche. Colman’s process approach allows for the sefirot being both particle and wave , so to speak. That is to say the self can be seen as a specific archetype (a particle) or the entire process of the psyche (a wave) depending on one’s view. A final citation sums up both the self and Tiferet well: Our individuation involves our becoming distinct and discrete individuals to the point at which we can confront the universe from which we have sprung as discrimi nated but intrinsically connected parts of it. Then, if we can gras p it, we might once again know the experience of wholeness at a diffe rent level: at the level of consciousness , the highest level of differentiation known to us. At this level, we might become differentiated enough to perceive our interconnection and onene ss with the universe. 145 From Colman’s insightful citation we now turn to Hartman’s analysis of the self in Jung’s work.   143 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 14. 144 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 14. 145 Colman, “Models of the Self”, 18."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 208 According to Gary V. Hartman, Jung defined the term “self” in three ways: 1. Self as an ego-ideal, the potential for the individual’s development 146 ; 2. Self as a more encompassing term for personality 147 ; 3. Self as the totality of the psyche with universal aspects. 148 The definition of the “self” given in CW 6 149 (the “self” most recognisable by those familiar with Jung today) was added later than the original publication date. 150 Originally in Jung’s thought, the term self “had figured under the concept of the ego.” 151 Hartman indicates that, at least in the early stages of his thought, “Jung subsumes Self to ego.” 152 The second meaning of self relates to and overlaps with the first. Hartman cites Jung’s 1916 paper “The Conception of the Unconscious” which has the self and the persona connected. Under the heading “B. The Composition of the Persona” we find the following subsections:   146 Hartman suggests that Jung’s early use of the self was derived from Jung’s experience with “S.W.” and her somnambulic alter-ego, Ivenes (Gary V. Hartman, “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology: The Early Years, 1900-1935.”, 4.

Hartman also cites par. 136: “Jung goes on in this paper to suggest that certain somnambulic manifestations may be ‘nothing but character-f ormations for the future personality, or their attempts to burst forth,’ having ‘a marked teleological meaning.’ This sounds more like an ego-ideal rather than the more numinous and cosmic qualities of the later ‘self’ assumed in Jung’s thinking.” (Hartman, “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology”, 5). The ideal personality also appears in Jung, “On the Relations of the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 398. Hartman also cites Jung’s “The Conception of The Unconscious” in Jung and C.E. Long, Collected Papers in Analytical Psychology (London: Balliere, Tindall and Cox, 1917), 472 where Jung, under the heading “B. The Composition of the Persona” speaks of the self as an ego. (Hartman, “History an d Development of Jung’s Psychology”, 6). 147 Hartman indicates that the second and first categor ies overlap (Hartman, “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology”, 5). 148 Hartman notes that this more inclusive form of “sel f” coincides with Jung’s work with Richard Wilhelm between the years of 1921 and 1935 and it may be that Jung was influenced by various aspects of Oriental and Eastern philosophy (Hartman, “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology”, 2, 7). 149 “As an empirical concept, the self designates th e whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whol e...[but] can be only in part conscious...” (Jung, Psychological Types , CW 6 , par. 789. 150 See Jung, Psychological Types , CW 6 , par. 183 n.85. 151 Jung, “Editorial Note”, CW 6 , v-vi. 152 Hartman, “History and Development of Jung’s Psychology”, 4."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 209 1. The conscious personal contents constitute the conscious personality, the conscious ego. 2. The unconscious personal contents constitute the self , the unconscious or subconscious ego. 3. The conscious and unconscious contents of a personal nature constitute the persona . 153 At this early stage of Jung’s t hought he refers to the self as ego and both ego and self are relegated under the term persona (a term Hartman points out Jung used as a synonym for “personality”). 154 According to Hartman, Jung’s model, at least at this point, could be summarised as: ego = conscious personality; self = unconscious personality; persona = ego. 155 The final stage of “self” development is reflected in Jung’s la ter works. Hartman observes that from “the early thirties onward, for Jung to sp eak of the Self is synonymous with ‘totality’ or ‘wholeness’” 156 and it is at this last stage that we approach Jung’s understanding of “self.” The purpose of this brie f review of the self was to indicate that the concept of the self is not a static or concretised concept in Jung’s thought and that the same fluidity be applied to the metaphors depicted below as well. In the Western Esoteric Tradition Tiferet corresponds to the astrological “planet” the sun. However, the Esoteric meaning of the sun does not corr espond entirely with Jung’s (and other Post-Jungian’s) perspective of the symbolic nature of the sun.

The sun represents the “Divine Spark” a nd the individual’s li nk to divinity, in other words the Holy Guardian Angel or Higher Genius.

There is also an overriding ai r of the sacred and the numinous. Each of these qualities resonates with Jung’s understand ing of the self.

Symbolised as a “beautiful naked woman”, Netzach can be encountered as either an open “unselfishness” or as “unchastity” or “lust.” 165 While the vices of unchastity and lust have a rather Christian moral overtone, one that would be fervently challenged by Esotericists such as Aleister Crowley, Netzach can be experienced either in a healthy and open way or in a potentially harmful and self-destructive way. Above Netzach we see the sefira Hesed . Hesed is also known as Gedulah (love or majesty) and is represented by a “mighty crowned and throned king.” Accompanied by a “Vision of Love” Hesed resonates with “Obedience” or, in its “nega tive” form, with “Bigotry, Gluttony [and] Tyranny.” 166 Here again we see a potential for growth, in the sense of obedience and dedication to God (in other wo rds, psychological faith in the value of the self and the depths of the collective unconscious), or a potential for disproportionate psychological perspective with an inability to discriminate or structure.

There is an obvious emphasi s on the importance of the self and, by extension, the process of individuation. The self-mandala, with Tiferet as the focal point, holds a central position on the Tree. This would translate into analytical psychological terms as the self being the central organising archetype in the psyche . However, there is another way to view the Tree and the self-mandala. Rather than submitting that the self-mandala or even that the self (i.e., Tiferet ) is the central archetype in the psyche, we can also see that each of the sefirot are interconnected. The sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life are simultaneously unique monads of experience (independent and defined) and an interconnected tapestry of psychic convergence wherein no one sefira holds a privileged position. Each sefira contributes to the overall structure of the Tr ee and the psyche.

He suggests that: it is time that ‘unity’ and ‘bal ance’ stopped receiving such bad press, and that we get over our ph obic response to wholeness .... We still live under the shadow of ‘bad unities’ (Christendom, Facism, Communism), and this con tinues to block our pathway to the new unities that might want to emerge in society and the psyche alike....The continuing value of Jung’s Self, that ‘umbrella’ archetype which brings warring elements into dialogue and relationship, may not be in its bad currency in intellectual society, but in its efficacy in psychic and public life. The fact is we do need very large concepts, ideas or deities to deal with the primal opposites such as inner and outer, masculine and feminine, which threaten to tear us apart if we side with one at the expense of the other. 174 The self, that “umbrella” archetype of ba lance and unity is represented in our interpretation of the Western Es oteric Tree of Life in a central capacity but one that owes its existence and energy to the remainder of the sefirot . Tiferet appears to be far removed from the ego-complex symbolised by Malkut . Patterns of archetypal images found on the left and right pi llars pull in opposite directions and can sweep the ego-complex along with them. The Middle Pillar mediates and balances the Pillar of Severity and the Pillar of Mercy. It also brings together   173 David Tacey, “Twisting and turning with James Hillman” in Ann Casement, ed.

The Middle Pillar, up to and including Tiferet , can be seen as representing what Edinger termed the “ego-self axis.” 175 Edinger defines the ego-self axis as th e “vital connection between ego and Self that must be relatively intact if the ego is go ing to survive stress and grow. This axis is the gateway or path of communication be tween the conscious personality and the archetypal psyche.” 176 This communication would translate as the connection between Malkut and Tiferet ( Tiferet here includes the surrounding sefirot of the self-mandala). The relationship between the ego and self is a difficult though essential one for psychological maturation. Edinger states, following Jung’s standard placement of the se lf as the central archetype in the psyche, that since “the Self is the central archetype it subordinates all other archetypal dominants. It surrounds and co ntains them. All pr oblems of alienation, whether alienation between ego and parent figures, between ego and shadow, or between ego and anima (or animus), are thus alienation between ego and Self.” 177 The Middle Pillar draws in all other sefirot and focuses them at Tiferet or the self. Knowing that the Tree is a malleable symbol we need not acquiesce to the claim that the self is the central archetype of the psyche. Ho wever, we can say that there is a sefira or middoth or quality of the unconscious that “contai ns” or resonates with the attributes of what Jung labelled the self. This sefira or quality of the unconscious can have a unique and transformative relation with the ego-complex, especially as reflected in the process of psychological and initiatory growth.

This effect would place the ar chetypal pattern of the self in a perceived position of centrality. From an Esoteric perspective the numinous quality of the ego-self axis can be easily translated to the relation between the Esotericist and his or her Holy Guardian Angel. Following the cosmology of the Western Es oteric Tradition we could state that there is a feeling of alienation between the Esotericist and his or her Angel that prompts the Esotericist to begin the Great Work, though he or she may not know this to be the reason at the time. The longing for union wi th the “other” portion of oneself takes on a fervent form of veneration. The separation, or rather perceived separation, between oneself and one’s Holy Guardian Angel is the cause of existential a ngst. Separation from one’s Angel is symbolic of the perspective of the separation from all things whatsoever. The root of this alienation is found in the perception of separation between oneself (ego- complex) and the Holy Guardian Angel (represented psychologically by the self). Yet union with the Holy Guardian Angel is not w ithout potential problems, not the least of which is inflation and the appearance of what Jung termed the “mana-personality.” Jung presents his notion of “mana-personality” in CW 7 . 178 Mana is a Melanesian word which refers to the numinous or magical pow er of spirits, gods or sacred artefacts. In Jung’s usage the term mana -personality refers to th e effect of assimilating undifferentiated or autonomous unconscious cont ents such as the anima/animus. Once the anima, for example, is differentiate d from the collective unconscious the mana- personality can surface.   178 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , pars. 374-406."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 219 The mana previously held by the anima b ecomes absorbed by the ego, or so it first seems to the individual who experiences it. In actuality while the ego becomes a mana- personality the fact remains that “the mana -personality is a dominant of the collective unconscious, the well known archet ype of the mighty man in th e form of a hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits, the friend of God.” 179 Given the magnitude of this archetype and it roots in the collective unconscious, it soon becomes clear that the ego is not, in fact, the owner of the newly liberated mana. The aforementioned figures represent a risk to the conscious e go; they can inflate the conscious mind and “can destroy everything that was gained by coming to terms with the anima.” 180 As long as the ego believes that it possesses the power of the unconscious it falls prey to the effects of inflation. No t the self aggrandising feelings of self importance mentioned above but inflation broug ht about through the direct influence of the collective unconscious. The ego did not conquer the anima and it pilfered something that did not belong to it. Ju st as the undifferentiated anima, as the classic contra-sexual archetype in a man’s psyche, could wield autonomous power ove r the conscious ego related around issues of “femininity”, the ne wly appearing male figures hold similar and equally disconcerting power: All that has happened is a new a dulteration, this time with a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago, and possessed of even greater power...Thus he becomes a superman, superior to all powers, a demigod at the very least. “I and the Father are one”—this mighty avowal in all its awful ambiguity is born of just such a psychological moment. 181   179 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 377. According to Jung these images apply to the psyche of a man. A woman would have the corresponding images of the Great Mother, par. 379. 180 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 378. 181 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 380."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 220 This natural occurrence 182 (we should not assume that this occurrence, so long as it is transitory, is in some way negative or harmful—as Moore is cited above, he prefers to deal with inflated people who “feel alive and important”) quickly becomes overwhelming for the ego and “if it has but a spark of self-knowledge, can only draw back and rapidly drop all preten ce of power and importance.” 183 Jung gives a brief review of the delusion that o ccurred between anima and ego: The conscious mind has not become master of the unconscious, and the anima has forfeited her ty rannical power only to the extent that the ego was able to come to terms with the unconscious. This accommodation, however, was not a vi ctory of the conscious over the unconscious, but the establis hment of a balance of power between two worlds. 184 The sole reason there existed imbalance in th e first place was that the ego “dreamed of victory over the anima.” 185 There are exceptions to this delusion though. If the ego remains strong and able to integrate unconscious material while differentiating itself from it one would have “the steadfastness of a superman of the sublimity of a perfect sage. Both figures are ideal images: Napoleon on the one hand, Lao-tzu on the other.” 186 Few of us can claim such heightened attainment and the best we can strive for is an ego which remains in a balanced state with the unconscious. Once the ego is differentiated from the mana-persona lity archetype it is then necessary to bring its specific traits to consci ousness, one must realise the archetype’s distinct and individual application. Jung indicates that for a man th is is the “second and real liberation from the father, and, for the woman, liberation from the mother, and with it   182 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 389. 183 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 381. 184 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 381. 185 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 381. 186 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 388."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 221 comes the first genuine sense of his or her true individuality”. 187 The liberation from the mana-personality also has implications for various religious traditions, especially the monotheistic traditions. It is possible, according to Jung, to project the psychic experience of the mana- personality “as an extra munda ne ‘Father in Heaven,’ comp lete with the attribute of absoluteness—something many people seem very prone to do.” 188 This elevation of the unconscious to the summum bonum can have the detrimental effect of generating, in psychological terms, an equally devilish figur e to compensate. Jung finds neither option desirable. With the projection of the mana-p ersonality comes the projection of individual values and non-values into both God and De vil which in turn influences the human condition. Jung calls for a re spectful attitude, not wors hip, toward the collective unconscious, in the same manner as we follow the laws of our society, that which is naturally more encompassing than our individu al perspectives. Now that a truce has been called between ego and anima, the questi on of the fate of the anima’s mana still remains. Neither consciousness nor the unconscious can claim the mana yet it must go somewhere. Jung looked to the universal und erstanding of the self. This summary from CW 7 presents a wonderful narrative of the course of the psychic mana: Thus the dissolution of the mana -personality through the conscious assimilation of its contents leads us, by a natural route, back to ourselves as an actual, living something, poised between two world-pictures and their darkly discerned potencies. This “something” is strange to us and yet so near, wholly ourselves and yet unknowable, a virtual centre of so mysterious a constitution that it can claim anything—kinship with beasts and gods, with crystals and with stars—without moving us to wonder, without   187 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par.392. 188 Jung, “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par.394."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 222 even exciting our disapprobation.

This formulation would not be unfitting, since the self has somewhat the character of a result, of a goal attained, something that has co me to pass very gradually and is experienced with much travail... our life’s goal, for it is the completest expression of that fateful combination we call individuality, the full flowering not only of the single individual, but of the group, in which each adds his portion to the whole. 190 The self, the “God within us” 191 is a superb representation of what the Esotericists call the Holy Guardian Angel, the process and resu lt known as “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel” and those co rrespondences that th ey attribute to the sefira Tiferet .

Over time this metaphorical materi al, which has been developed over centuries in an attempt to describe the abstract nature of reality, becomes familiar both on a conscious level, through the repeated training and initiatio n and on an unconscious level through the use of dream and fantasy material . If the unconscious does actually have the drive to become conscious in consciousne ss, then providing th e unconscious with a highly symbolic and loosely structured model through which the psyche can communicate should aid in the process of bringing unc onscious material into consciousness. The work of individuation, as underst ood by Jung, would occur within the realm of the lower seven sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. From Malkut we must come to understand that there is more to “reality” than s imply what is outside of our windows. There is a psychic world that can betray our most adamant volition if we do not enter into rapport with it.

From a clinical perspective the theories and models of analytical psychology are applied to help individuals understand their psychological dispositions and to take steps toward becoming psychologically whole, how ever that wholeness may be defined. Functioning in this world of potential ma laise (both physiologica l and psychological) requires, from a Jungian perspective, a str ong ego and an appreciati on and respect for the reality of the collectiv e unconscious. However, the Esoter icist looks toward the Supernal Abyss with the same sense of necessity and urgency as the analyst views the integration of unconscious psychic material. Severa l questions arise from an analytical psychological interpretation of the Western Es oteric Tree of Life including what is beyond the self as symbolised by Tiferet and what is the role of the second Abyss?

The development of the ego-self axis is presen ted by Jung as a natural part of individuation (more on this below); the ego/self-coll ective unconscious axis suggests that the individuation process includes an initiatory process of e ngaging with metaphors of a non- dual transpersonal nature. In other words, the ego/self-collective unconscious axis could be thought of as emphasising the self pole of Jung’s ego-self axis but also incorporating states of non-dual tran spersonal experience. Analytical psychology implies the depths of the psyche have some meaning or value and therefore it is in or der to realise a richer psycholo gical life that the journey on the Tree is undertaken and ultimately, the journey is to be taken for its own sake. The initiatory experience of the Supernal Abyss, the eventual dissolving of the subject/object dichotomy, would best reflect th e deeper nature of the ego/self-collective unconscious axis. The question is, of course, how much of that axis can the ego-complex actually perceive or re tain? Or how can the potentially enveloping tide of the collective unconscious be harnessed for use by the ego-self axis? Obviously in a thesis of this limited scope these questions cannot be assessed in a comprehensive manner. However, the following observations may aid in assessing some of these issues. While the Western Esoteric Tradition has made use of various degrees or levels of initiation there are, in fact, only two primary goals. The first is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the sec ond is the crossing of the Supernal Abyss.

Aleister Crowley is likely the most prolific Esoteric writer on the nature of the Abyss. Unfortunately, most of his writings that are concer ned with the nature of the Abyss are couched in his own Thelemic cosmology making him in many respects the least useful introductory source to the Abyss. We will turn to Crowley’s comprehension of the Abyss shortly but first we shall turn to his colleagues within the Esoteric Tradition. Israel Regardie states that the sefirot of the Supernal Triad above the Abyss are ideal 192 while the remainder of the sefirot are actual . The Abyss is the metaphysical gap between them. 193 The Abyss is conceived of as a “b arren desert of sand wherein die the thoughts and empirical egos of men, ‘birth-strangled babe s’ as the expression goes.” 194 The analogy of the Abyss being a desert is also amplified in Chapter 42, “Dust-Devils”, of Crowley’s The Book of Lies . This chapter was likely the inspiration of Regardie’s reference: In the Wind of the mind arises the turbulence called I. It breaks; down shower the barren thoughts. All life is choked. This desert is the Abyss wherin is the Universe. The Stars are thistles in that waste. Yet this desert is but one spot accursed in the world of   192 That is to say those sefirot above the Supernal Abyss are abstractions with the potential to manifest. Kether is taken to be the fourth Kabbalistic World, Atzilut and is also known as the Archetypal World or the Will of Deity (See Lon Milo DuQuette, The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed ben Clifford (York Beach, ME: Weiser Books, 2001), 139; Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (York Beach, ME: Weiser Books, 2000), 22 for example. Both Hokmah and Binah , while not part of the Archetypal world (they comprise the third world Briah ) form the purely abstract nature of Kether into the potential for actualisation. In this way the sefirot below the Supernal Abyss can be seen as archetypal images that provide form and detail. 193 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 44. 194 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 69."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 227 bliss.

The Great Sea is the Great Mother Binah , the first sefira beyond the Abyss. While Crowley, as V.V.V.V.V., claims to have crossed the Abyss what is interesting is that each person who attempts to cross the desert adds to the good of the whole. Fr om an analytical psychological context, each person who delves deeper into the Tree of Li fe and the unconscious does so not only for their own well-being but the well bei ng of humanity as a whole. On the surface it would appear that by Re gardie’s reckoning the Supernal Abyss indicates the destru ction of the ego-complex. Coming from a background which involved a fair bit of psychology, it seems rath er unlikely that he would be advocating the destruction of the ego-complex. The actual intent is summarised by Regardie as follows: What is actually being destroyed is simply the unconscious illusion of the separate self and the restrictions which that illusion formerly imposed upon the blazing star or monad within. It is but the shifting of the Point-of-View from that which has no real life of its own to a new and nobler centre of re integration which is vital, real, and eternal. 196 Rather than destroying the ego-complex th e Abyss represents a radical change in perception and perspective. It is a shift in focus from the individual and his or her subjective constructs to a perspective of inclusiveness and interconnectedness.   195 Aleister Crowley, The Book of Lies , 6 th ed.

He indicates that to cross the “Great Abyss” is to symbolically die: We must be prepared to ‘die’, or part from our own existing formulations of ideas which bind us to materialized beliefs, so that we may follow the path of pure power straight to its spiritual source beyond the confines of consciousness from which we would emerge into fresh fields of illumination. 197 Gray sees that there is a limit to what words or dogmatic beliefs can accomplish and that when that limit is reached one must be prepared to leave it behind. He states that when “an idea is taken so far in words the ‘word- body’ can be sacrificed for ‘sculpture-body’ or ‘music-body’ or ‘mathematical-body’ the ‘Soul’ is along the same idea but the reincarnation takes various forms.” 198 The death of the ‘word-body’, the body of description and mental analys is, makes it possible for the underlying meaning to surface in a myriad of other manifestations. There is an impression of conversion a nd transformation in Gray’s conception of the Abyss but that “turn around” while dr astic, does not guarantee a lofty spiritual status. 199 Gray informs us that such “a drastic ch ange, however, is not ‘i nstant evolution.’ We may become different beings from an expressional st and point, but we do not become immediately better or more highly evolved souls just because we have crossed into other conditions of consciousness.” 200 Dion Fortune also adds some important details to the nature of the Abyss.

Crowley was equally interested in employing terms of Eastern philosophy and religion and those of Western culture so it is not surprising that he uses concepts from both traditions in describing his understanding of the Abyss. Knight’s definition of the Abyss as the Dark Night of the Soul could be seen as reflecting the intrinsic Christian dichotomy and separation of matter and sp irit, heaven and earth, or humanity and divinity.

In Crowley’s view the Abyss is entirely concerned with personal mental pe rspective and psychologi cal processes. He states that any idea that is in itself: positive and negative, active and passive, male and female, is fit to exist above the Abyss; any idea not so equilibrated is below the Abyss, contains in itself an unmitigat ed duality or falsehood, and is to that extent qliphotic and dangerous. 205 The Adept must strive to equalise and negate thoughts so as to avoid giving predominance to one thought over another. According to Crowley there are two factors involved in passing through the Abyss. The first is the attraction of the sefira Binah . Binah compels the Adept to take the Oath of the Abyss and attempt to cross it. We could interpret this compulsion present in Binah as the ideal or potential of the drive for th e unconscious to become conscious that is first actualised and experienced in Tiferet and finally manifesting through Yesod into Malkut . “Love is the motive power which makes the Adeptus Exemptus take the plunge into the Abyss.” 206 Crowley’s use of the term “Love” usually denotes an impersonal union of opposites or the merging of subject and object, not an emotional state or response.

The Ad ept wilfully heeds that pull and makes what amounts to a leap of faith. The second factor that n eeds to be addressed in cr ossing the Abyss is the karma of the Adept. The term karma is generally misunderstood or simplified in popular culture. There seems to a trend to interpret karma , which means “deed” or “action,” from a purely physical perspective. 207 In other words, karma is relegated solely to physical acts. For example, if someone were to harm anot her individual the popular understanding of karma would have us believe that his or her action has karmic consequences. His or her actions would then lead to a reciproc ation of those actions upon themselves in some form at a later time. While karma does refer to physical actions it also refers to actions of a more subtle nature. Karma also, and more importantly, refers to mental actions or deeds. 208 More unsettling than harming someone are the mental processes that led to the action. If an individual harms another there is not some ethereal court waiting to exact justice on the perpetrator. Rather, the mental patterns he or she has laid in th e past contributed to them inflicting that harm. These patterns and the corresponding actions make it more likely that the habitual violence will continue and will eventually envelope the individual in a similar fashion. Those who assume that karma refers only to physical actions are missing a vital key to what Crowley is attempting to communicate.   207 The following is an example, taken from a popular book on Witchcraft (Wicca), of this emphasis on the physical definition of the term: “The simplest way to look at karma is as a kind of spiritual bank-balance of one’s good and evil deeds , and of the results of one’s wisdom and stupidity, over the totality of one’s life.” Janet and Stewart Farrar, The Witches’ Way: Principles, Ritual s and Beliefs of Modern Witchcraft , 5 th ed.

(Wheaton, Ill: Theosophical Publishing House, 1989), 53.

For Crow ley crossing the Abyss “is a permanent and fundamental revolution in the whole of one’s being.” 210 It is on this point that we must deviate from Crowley. The Aby ss experience, like that of one ’s initial experience of the shadow, is momentous and it may have a lasting impact on one’s psyche. However, as shadow work and the work of individuation is never finished and must be perpetually tended to, so it is, we may postulate, with the experience of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. We cannot assume, from an analy tical psychological pe rspective that the difficulties and problems symbolised by the Abyss, and we should remember that the Abyss is a symbol and metaphor not an actua l “place”, can be forgotten once the initial experience has been encountered. It is not a one-off experience but one that we could and likely would return to time and time again. From the perspective of an analytical psychological interpretation of the Tree of Life, Binah , as part of the Supernal Triad representing the transpersonal collective unconscious, draws the indivi dual into deeper investigations of the collective unconscious. The karma or mental tendencies of the individual will dictate the result and nature of the crossing of the Abyss. Should the individual be unprepared to leave behind entrenched views of creed, imposed social, professional or familiar personas, or the   209 Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba , 713. 210 Aleister Crowley, Magick Without Tears (Tempe, AZ: New Falcon, 1994), 112."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" 233 illusory separation of subject and object, then that individual will have a difficult time with the “denizen of the Abyss”, Choronzon. Crowley personified the chaos of the Abyss with a demon taken from the writings of the Elizabethan astrologer, spy, and diplomat, John Dee (1527-1608). However, Choronozon should not be taken to represent an actual being. Crowley emphasises that: The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an individual. The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equally inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the word—tha t is, meaningless but malignant, insofar as it craves to become real. These forms swirl senselessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils, and each such chance aggregation asserts itself to be an individual, and sh rieks “I am I!” though aware all the time that its elements have no true bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusion just as a horseman, meeting a dust devil, bri ngs it in showers of sand to the earth. 211 The confrontation with Choronzon is nothing less than the metaphorical confrontation with the pure potential of our mind’s need to analyse, label, relate and define. Da’at represents the height of human intellect an d knowledge at the hi ghest level of human understanding. Yet it is personified, at leas t by Crowley, as a demon thus reflecting a darker or shadow side. On an individual level Choronzon represents the boundary of our personal perceptions of the “ objective” world of form and th e “subjective” world of the psyche. Earlier we noted that L on Milo DuQuette equated Hesed with the demiurge. Hesed applies the initial form to the potentiality found with Da’at , a process which continues with even greater structure in Geburah . The demiurge possesses the ability to create, to differentiate and to give form to me ntal stimulus that allows us to experience and appreciate such things as art, music, poetry, and various other examples of human   211 Crowley, The Vision and the Voice , 24."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 234 creativity on a personal level. However, the movement to Geburah and down to Hod , can also take that ability to differentiate a nd mould it into rigid structures that can begin to destroy the initial experience by altering it and forcing it to conform to imposed mental tendencies. The demiurge can function in e ither context depending on the perspective of the individual at that moment. The Abyss is a breaking down of the mental truths, labels and constructs we perpetuate. It could be said that it is in some respects the inspiration of the postmodern perspective. 212 If we can identify and ac knowledge the structure we can begin to break it down into to smaller a ggregates thereby opening new avenues of investigation and meaning rather than bei ng a passive participant in imposed meaning and structure. If we look at how the Abyss functions on an individual level we see, as William Gray stated, that it insists on the death of “our own existing formul ations of ideas which bind us to materialized beliefs.” Only thr ough the shedding of the need, or perhaps the term compulsion is more illustrative, for defining and confining reality to the personal, subjective experience ca n the source of the experience, the unconscious, hope to express itself. Following the Hermetic axiom what is below (the individual) is like that which is above (the unified collective) we must also reflect on what the Abyss signifies on a larger scale. We can see the Abyss as the boundary between personal and transpersonal, non- dual experience. Obviously when discussing th e concept of transpersonal experience we are placing a value on that particular form of consciousness. Authors such as Jung, 213   212 I am grateful to my advisor, Dr. Roderick Main for initially making this observation. 213 For Jung transpersonal is equivalent with the coll ective unconscious (Jung, “On the Psychology of the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 150) but a collective unconscious that reaches back to our an imal ancestry (Jung, “On the Psychology of the Unconscious”, CW 7 , par. 159)."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 235 posit that the transpersonal e xperience is more desirable than a limited ego-centric perspective even though there may be varying definitions of what “transpersonal” implies. By taking the step into th e Abyss one metaphorically acknowledges the necessity of leaving behind the boundaries that were deve loped over years of social, psychological and spiritual conditioning and training. A view similar to the Abyss is also posited by Jung in relation to the gulf between consciousness and the unconscious. In “Transformation Symbolism in the Mass”, Jung expresses concern with the cost humans have paid for the establishment consciousness and Logos at the detriment of instinct and “a loss of reality to the degree the he remains in primitive dependence on mere words.” 214 For Jung an over emphasis on consciousness or rupture of the link with the unconscious, as reflected in our dependency on words as signifiers which we take to be the object, can have adverse consequences. Further in “Transformation Symbolism in the Mass” Jung states that: This rupture of the link with th e unconscious and our submission to the tyranny of words have one great disadvantage: the conscious mind becomes more and more the victim of its own discriminating activity, the picture we have of the world gets broken down into countless particulars, and the orig inal feeling of unity, which was integrally connected with the un ity of the unconscious psyche, is lost. 215 The more words and concepts are employed, and even more dangerous believed or literalised, the further one is isolated from the collective unconscious. This dichotomous situation is evident th roughout both our own psychic world a nd the world “outside” of it. Again Jung reflects on the ramifications of an overemphasis on the intellect: And just as the intellect subjugate d the psyche [in relation to the development of Christian doctrine] , so also it subjugated Nature   214 Jung, “Transformation Symbolism in the Mass”, CW 11 , par. 442. 215 Jung, “Transformation Symbolism in the Mass”, CW 11 , par. 443."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" 236 and begat her an age of scientific technology that left less and less room for the natural and irrationa l man. Thus the foundations were laid for an inner opposition which today threatens the world with chaos. 216 The concern regarding an overemphasis on rationality is an important part of Jung’s thought and can be seen as equally part of Crowley’s conceptualisation of the Supernal Abyss as representative of the mind’s capab ility and capacity to analyse and define, though in a hyperactive manner. We could say that it is a hyperactive state of defining through the use of concepts and words wh ere the individual takes literally their personal relationship with metaphor. 217 If the collective unconsci ous is drowned out by the ceaselessly turning conscious mind the result, at least in the thought of Jung and some individuals within the Western Esoteric Tradition, is separati on from an important part of the human psyche. Jung’s understanding of individuation require s that the individual delve into the recesses of their unconsciousness and conf ront and strive to understand what is uncovered. This process will inevitably lead the individual to see that we all share a common link and that link is our connection to the collective unconscious. However, Jung’s view still emphasises the personal experience of the unconscious; Jung did not, nor should he have been expected to, challenge the necessity of the ego or personal consciousness. He did emphasise limiting the ego’s inflated perspective as centre of the psyche but the personal perspective was not seen as a hurdle in individuation.

In other words, Hinman tells us, “[o]ur metaphors thereby acquire an independence and power insofar as they are no longe r taken as metaphors but rather as the measure of reality itself; in becoming dead metaphors, they come to rule us. ‘A language,’ as one recent writer on metaphor has suggested, ‘is nothing but a necropolis of dead metaphors.’” Lawrence M Hinman, “Nietzsche, Metaphor, and Truth” in Philosophy and Phenomenology Research , Vol. 43, No. 2, Dec., 1982."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 237 Western Esoteric Tree of Life requires that the personal perspective should be challenged for further psychological and spiritual growth.

The Golden Dawn and Esotericists such as Gareth Knight tell us that the grades beyond the Abyss are reserved for very few (if any) corporeal be ings, whereas Crowley’s more psychological approach insists that every person sha tter the boundaries of their perceptions of personality and individual identity by attemp ting to attain the experience of the non-dual transpersonal Supernal Triad. Though the Supe rnal Triad may have different meanings in various traditions, if the Supernal Abyss is experi enced by our conscious minds as a tumultuous whirlwind of thought, as with Crowley, then the Supernal Triad would represent a form of psychic primordial chao s in which our conscious minds could become enveloped and overwhelmed. Ho wever, to one trained and prepared for such chaos the transformation can be, at least according to some Esotericists, one of the most sublime experiences humanly possible. This chapter explores the traditional correspondences of the remaining three sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life. Following this review we will turn to how transpersonal experiences fit within Jung’s model of the psyche by analysing Jung’s use of the unus mundus and his theory of synchronicity. We will also review how Jung himself may be viewed as a “detradionalised my stic” as well as a scientist as indicated in an article by Leon Schlamm. Before we begi n an analysis of the Supernal Triad it would be advantageous for us to revi ew what Jung had to say about the possibility of coming to know, consciously, the collective unconscious.

When J ung spoke of the collective unconscious it was understood that there was no way for consciousness to directly experience this collective stratum of the psyche. Jung makes this poi nt very clear in th e Tavistock lectures: Consciousness is like a surface or skin upon a vast unconscious area of unknown extent. We do not know how far the unconscious rules because we simply know nothing of it. You cannot say anything about a thing of which you know nothing....We have only indirect proofs that there is a mental space which is subliminal. We have some scientific justification for our conclusions that it exists. 1 Rather than directly experiencing the collective unconscious we experience the archetypal symbols or metaphors of the collective unconscious. Jung’s Kantian approach to knowledge as experience has im portant implications. Although we may not directly experience the unconscious as concep tualised by Jung without mediating symbols and metaphors, Nagy points out when reviewing Jung’s use of Kant that “we must not be so full of pride as to limit our concept of reality to what is experienced as outer object.” 2 The Western Esoteric Tradition a nd its use of the Tree of Life can be taken as an example of the “indirect proofs” mentioned by Jung in the above citation. That is to say the Esoteric Tree of Life, when approached from the perspective of analytical psychology, can be seen as a co llection of symbols and metaphors of the collective unconscious and the process of individuation. The following interpretation of the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Traditi on maintains this psychological and metaphorical perspective.   1 Jung, “The Tavistock Lectures”, CW 18 , par. 11. 2 Marilyn Nagy, Philosophical Issues in the Psychology of C.G.

It would be incorrect to assume that Binah , Hokmah , and Kether are somehow more important, vital or sacred than the lower sefirot . Each of the sefirot are equal in that they are derived from the same, singular source. For th e Esotericists this source would be the Divine; for an analytical psychological interpretation of the Esoteric Tree of Life the source is the undifferentiated depths of the collective unc onscious. Though not actually separate from the remainder of the sefirot , the Supernal Triad does mark a significant change in perspective, one that when compared to the consciousness of the lower sefirot , warrants unique treatment. On the one hand, the sefirot below the Supernal Abyss are transpersonal but there is a dualistic or theistic “I/thou” relationship between the practitioner and the specific sefira . On the other hand, the sefirot of the Supernal Triad reflect more of a non-dual transpersonal mode. Binah was presented in Chapter One as an example of the types of correspondences commonly applied to the sefirot . 3 We shall now endeavour to unpack more of the nature of Binah and this sefira’s place within the Supernal Triad. First we shall look to Dion Fortune’s and Gareth Knight’s more traditional analysis of Binah . Following this, we shall briefly look at how Aleister Crowley describes Binah as the Whore of Babalon [sic].

The titles of Binah reflect the dual nature of this sefira . Binah is known as: Ama (dark sterile mother), Aima (bright fertile mother), Kursiya (Throne [stability]), and Marah (The Great Sea [fluidity]). Binah’s vision is the Vision of Sorrow and the virtue is Silence with the vice being Avar ice. The symbols assigned to Binah are the yoni , kteis , Vesica Piscis , cup/chalice, and the Robe of Outer Concealment. 5 As we can see from the metaphors of Binah this sefira represents “the female potency of the universe, even as Chokmah represents the male.” 6 The latter symbols listed above each reflect some aspect of this female potency. We see the yoni and kteis , both references to the vagina as is the Vesica Piscis . 7 The elemental weapon or tool, the cup, is receptive in nature (as opposed to the projective knife/sword and wand 8 ) as is the robe worn by the practitioner. The robe c ontains and envelops th e practitioner and as Crowley states, the robe “ is that which conceals, and protects the Magician from the elements; it is the silence a nd secrecy with which he works, the hiding of himself in the occult life of Magick and Meditation. ” 9 There is an overtly womb-like nature to the robe. Each of these symbols reflects an aspect of how the Esotericists view Binah ; however, perhaps more obviously than any of the sefirot “below” the Supernal Abyss, Binah is best defined in connection to the surrounding sefirot .   4 Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2000), 130-131. 5 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 129-130. 6 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 130. 7 For more on the vesica piscis (fish bladder), also known as the “New Jerusalem” see Lon Milo DuQuette’s Understanding Aleister Crowley’s Thoth Tarot (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2003), 155-160. 8 The ritual use of the chalice/cup and the wand/spear, as symbolic of male and female, can be found in Crowley’s Gnostic Mass (Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1997), 584- 597 as well as the Wiccan ritual of the Great Rite (See: Janet and Stewart Farrar A Witches Bible Complete (New York: Mgickal Childe Pub lishing, Inc., 1984), 48-54) 9 Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba , 106.

Hokmah is still highly abstract but represents a stirring or ac tivity of the energies of Kether , while Binah provides stability and focus to the primordial stirrings. Binah is both the “womb of manifestation”, as Binah gives rise to the potential for form, and it is consequently the constricting presence of death. 10 On the one hand, Binah represents the restriction of the potentiality of Hokmah and on the other hand “she” is the womb of manifestation and therefore she is also the gateway to finitude. It is this role of constriction/death that Fortune sees as underlying the equating of the feminine with negativity. Fortune states that Kether is understood to be the ultimate good and the source of all things. The nature of Kether , being kinetic, flows to the dynamic sefira Hokmah . In this case Hokmah appears to support or amplify the essence of Kether . On the other hand we have Binah . Fortune puts forward this interes ting theory which corresponds in many ways to Jung’s understanding of th e “missing fourth” of the Trinity 11 in that it ties together the feminine, the natural world and the demonic. This “missing fourth” is the balancing factor necessary for the overly be neficent and intangible Christian Trinity. Here we find Fortune state: Binah, the opposite of Chokmah, the perpetual opposer of the dynamic impulses, will be regarded as the enemy of God, the evil one. Saturn-Satan is an easy tr ansition; and so is Time-Death- Devil. Implicit in the ascetic religions such as Christianity and Buddhism is the idea that woman is the root of all evil, because she is the influence which holds men to a life of form by their desires. Matter is regarded by them as the antinomy of spirit in an eternal, unresolved duality. Christianity is ready enough to recognise the heretical nature of this belief when it is presented to it in the form of Antinomianism; but it does not realise that its own teaching and   10 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 130. 11 See Jung, “A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity”, CW 11 , pars. 243-285."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 244 practice are equally antinomian when it regards matter as the enemy of spirit, and as such to be abrogated and overcome. This unhappy belief has caused as much human suffering in Christian countries as war and pestilence. 12 Fortune brings to light a potential problem for each of the sefirot . If the sefirot are over simplified, or we could argue if they are st rictly defined, there is a possibility of distortion. By reducing the sefirot to definable (conscious) concep ts or definitions we lose the autonomous and unique nature of the sefirot . Binah is an important example of this fact. Fortune indicates that Binah and the Supernal Triad are not separate from the remainder of the Tree and that they are all interpenetrated; “[i]t is for this reason that a hard and fast attribution of the gods of other pantheons to the different Sephiroth is impracticable. Aspects of Isis are found in Binah, Netzach, Yesod, and Malkuth. Aspects of Osiris are found in Chokmah, Chesed, and Tifereth.” 13 We could also say that aspects of the anima can be found in Binah , Netzach , Yesod , and Malkut while aspects of the self can be found in Hokmah , Geburah , Hesed , Tiferet —we soon reach a point where dissecting the sefirot becomes an ineffectual and self-d efeating endeavour. By applying a concept such as the sefirot and the Tree of Life to these archetypes we can come to an alternative view of their nature and how it ma y be possible to further engage with them. To fully engage the sefirot , especially the highly abstract nature of the Supernal Triad, requires, according to Fortune, a sense of faith. Chapter Four began with a brief review of Jung’s understanding of what he termed a “religious attitude” which was also related to Hillman’s notion of a   12 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 133-134. 13 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 134."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 245 psychological sense of “faith”. 14 From the Esotericists we find that Fortune indicates, following the corresponding Yetsiratic text, that Binah is the seat of faith: A cynic defined faith as the pow er of believing what you know isn’t true; and this appears to be a fairly accurate definition for the manifestations of faith as they appear in uninstructed minds, the fruit of the discipline of s ects unenlightened by mystical consciousness. But in the light of that consciousness we may define faith as the conscious resu lt of superconscious experience which has not been translated into terms of brain consciousness, and of which, therefore, the norm al personality is not directly aware, though it nevert heless feels, possibly with great intensity, the effects, and its emotional reactions are fundamentally and permanently modified thereby. 15 Fortune’s definition of “faith” is one that is concerned not with the doctrine of exoteric traditions but with direct experience of “superconsciousness” which cannot be bound by rational discourse or dogmatic assu mptions. Knight’s treatment of Binah follows closely that of Fortune’s save for one important diffe rence, namely, his description of the grade that commonly corresponds to Binah . Knight’s description of the Magister Templi (Master of the Temple, 8=3) grade gives a human dimension (i.e. a microcosmic di mension in the Esoteric parlance) to the abstract nature of Binah . According to Knight, the term applies to: one who is absolute master of the arbitration and manipulation of force and form and who has complete under standing of the cosmic power and the creation of requisite forms in wh ich this power may manifest. Also, who has the ability to gauge conditions from day to day and to accept people as they are at any given moment, seeing the stage that they have reached and taking into account the diffe rence between a soul as it is and what it will become as a result of further training; and including in the assessment the effects of karma on the personality or physical vehicle. 16   14 Page 156ff. 15 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 135-136. 16 Gareth Knight, A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1993), v.

These are metaphysical and spiritual assumptions of the Western Esoteric Tradition and are difficult, if not impossible, to prove or disprove. However, the latter portion of the description does make an interesting claim. This grade would seem to correspond to one who is comp letely aware and in control of his or her being on every level. This awareness is so acute that it can then be applied to the understanding and awareness of all humanit y. Clearly the Magister Templi is an extraordinary figure and sy mbol. While Knight helps to elucidate what Binah may represent on a personal level, Crowley leads us even deeper into the human condition. Crowley attaches the title “Whore of Babalon” to the sefira Binah . 17 Rarely one to use a technical term without forethought, Crowley applied the term “whore” with specific intention. Lon Milo DuQuette simplifies the Binah /Babalon matter in The Magick of Thelema : The Third Sephirah, Binah represents the original reconciliation and balance of the Divine Self (Kether) and the reflected Not Self (Chokmah). She is viewed as th e all-receptive mate of Chokmah and when they are united the primal unity of Kether is realized. As Binah/Babalon resides just abov e the Abyss, She eventually received unto Herself the totality of the life of the evolving universe. This universal life is symbolized as the “blood of the Saints” which She gathers up into Her great cup (the Holy Graal [sic]). This She shares with the Beast [i.e., Hokmah ], and they unite in drunken ecstasy. Thus sh e is called the Great Whore for in her “shamelessness” she receives all and refuses none. 18   17 The peculiar spelling of Babalon has two likely s ources or influences. The first influence is the Book of the Law where Babalon was held by Crowley to be a secret name of Nuit, the symbol of the infinite universe. See Crowley, The Law is for All (Tempe, AZ: New Falcon Publications, 1996), 37. The second likely influence is from the Enochian language popularised by John Dee. The Enochian term babalond means harlot. See Donald C. Laycock, The Complete Enochian Dictionary (York Beach: Red Wheel/Weiser, LLC, 2001), 83. 18 Lon Milo DuQuette, The Magick of Thelema (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1993), 83."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 247 Crowley makes several contributions toward understandi ng the nature of Binah through the poetic e xpression of his Book of Lies .

The complexity of the Thelemic deity or symbol of Babalon is beyond the scope of this thesis. However, we should note that both Binah and Babalon represent a seemingly dichotomous state. It is a state that simultaneously reflects a sublime mystical union and universal Sorrow (the duhkha/dukkh ā of Buddhism) or th e lustful whore who denies no one and the Dark Mother who dest roys all in her wake while simultaneously giving birth to difference and di fferentiation. Knight has given us one definition of what it means to be a Magister Templi, the grade symbolising Binah . Crowley gives us another definition that we should consider before continuing on to Hokmah . In his “One Star in Sight” Crowley defines what each grade symbolises, at least from his perspective. The Master of the Temple includes: The essential Attainment that is the perfect annihilation of that personality which limits and oppresse s His true Self. The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that is, His Understanding is entirely free fr om internal contradiction or external obscurity; His Word is to comprehend the existing Universe in accordance with His ow n Mind. He is the Master of the Law of Sorrow ( dukkh ā ). 29 As we can see, Crowley adds a more psychologi cal interpretation of this grade. That is not to say that Knight, Fortune or other Esotericists were oblivious to possible psychological interp retation of the sefirot , only that their writings do not emphasise it. Again, we can see with Crowley that rather than the Supernal Triad symbolising the middoth or qualities of a transcendent God, they represent particular experiences or qualities that are of a psycho-spiritual nature.   29 Aleister Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1997), 492."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 249 Hokmah : Supernal Father, Chaos and the Beast Hokmah compliments Binah while at the same time Binah is the compliment of Hokmah .

The Supernal Triad imply, especially in the writings of Crowley, a divesting or shedding of the no tion of individuality and duality. In this way the Supernal Triad of the initiatory Wester n Esoteric Tradition Tree of Life is transpersonal in a non- dual capacity; it requires the dismantling of th e whole idea of individuality finally being entirely absorbed in Kether in a non-dual union. The sefirot below the Supernal Abyss have pe rsonal or subjective experiences and images applied to them. The abst ract and transpersonal nature of Hokmah and Binah , falling on the other side of the Abyss, cannot be directly experienced in any subjective or personal way; they are the primordial Yin ( Binah ) and Yang ( Hokmah ) of the Tao ( Kether and its source). They inform and influence the lower sefirot but they remain highly abstract if viewed independently from the remainder of the Tree. Fortune reveals that there is an inte resting connection between the “Supernal Father” ( Hokmah ) and the “Inferior Mother” ( Malkut ) through Binah . The Superior Mother ( Binah ) also known as “The Throne” is a dir ect link between “the most abstract"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 251 form of force” and the “densest form of matte r” which hints, “that each of this pair of extreme opposites is the supreme manifestation of its own type, and both are equally holy in their different ways.” 32 We shall now briefly step out of the Es oteric terminology and into the language of the analytical psychology; how ever, the following is the author’s interpretation and not Jung’s. The analytical psyc hological interpenetration of Binah and Hokmah represents the potential for non-dual transpersonal e xperience of the colle ctive unconscious (as represented by the pinnacle of th e Path of the Serpent/Arrow) that are directly linked with Malkut (ego-complex) and fully symbolised in Kether . The direct connection between these three sefirot (four if Kether is included) is represented by what we are labelling the ego/self-collective uncon scious axis. By loosening rigid egocentric persp ectives, brought about within the Western Esoteric perspec tive through various ritu als and practices, the ego-complex can appreciate and in some cases briefly identify with the archetypes as the patterns and images of the unconscious. Bo th shadow and self, for example, are experienced as unique to the i ndividual even though either can be experienced as “more” numinous, collective or transpers onal than that indivi dual perspective. Letting go of that personal perspective, symbolised by the cros sing of the Supernal Abyss, leads to the direct experience of the source of the self and every other archetypal image, in other words, the undifferentiated potentiality of the collective unconscious in what is generally labelled a mystical or transpersonal expe rience. This is, of course, a matter of speculation as all experience of the unconsci ous must be perceived and experienced through the ego-complex.   32 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah , 119."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 252 From the above it is obvious that the term self is not used in the sense of being the totality of the psyche. Rather, it represents the totality of an individual’s experience of their own psyche. Tiferet and the Holy Guardian Angel are understood as being both separate from the individual yet unique to the individual. In a way, the archetypal image and the experience of the self, is still connect ed to the individual w ho experiences it. We see from the Tree that the direct source of Tiferet’s energy or nature is Kether . We could call Kether the unmanifest, abstract or truly collective self, while Tiferet is, through its connection with the individual, the manifest experience of the self. Again both the experience of Tiferet and Kether (or in other words the self as archetypal image and the totality of the psyche) are transpersonal in that they are both greater than the ego-complex and more comprehensive in perspective. To speak of the self in any way that implies personal, dualistic expe rience would point to Tiferet , while discussing the collective processes or implications of the self inde pendent of personal experience refers to the Supernal Triad (and Kether specifically as the highest sefira ). This differentiation would be a matter of degree of impact on the ego- complex. An experience of the self of Tiferet would be like a powerful or transformative dream that compensates for an imbalance in the ego-complex. The self is experienced as other than oneself and therefore transpersonal. The self of the Supernal Triad would be more like the experience of sam ā dhi or a similar non-dual state where the bounda ry of the individual ego-complex is lost. By combining Jung’s model of the psyche with the Western Esoteric Tree of Life we find interesting parallels such as the multifaceted understanding of archetypes such as the self."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 253 Crowley equated Binah with the Whore of Babalon. We also find that he altered the name of Hokmah as well. For Crowley Hokmah is labelled both Chaos and Therion (The Beast). The Whore riding the Beast is a personification for the conjoining of force and form; the ecstatic joining of universal opposites. Hokmah , as the number two, is also the “chaotic despoiler of the perfect unity of the first Sephirah, Kether. Chaos is another title of Chokmah and in certain Thelemic ritual is identified with Therion.” 33 According to DuQuette, Therion and Babalon can be equated to Shiva and Shakti , further perpetuating the notion of unity and numinous ecstasy. 34 The grade corresponding to a sefira indicates what transformations or developments are to have occurred in the psyc ho-spiritual life of the initiate. The grade assigned to Hokmah (Magus 9=2) is even more “enlightened” and “perfect” than the grade corresponding to Binah . No vice is given to Hokmah indicating that no potential shadow exists for the Magus. From an analyt ical psychological perspective this state is a difficult one to accept as our human condition im plies that the potential for the shadow to appear always exists. The obvious underlying assumption of this th esis is that Jung’s theories can be compared with other theories, such as the th eories of Western Esot eric Kabbalah, in such a manner as to create new and alternative perspe ctives that may not be otherwise present. Jung’s concept of shadow is an excellent exam ple of this. Rather than simply accepting the Esoteric interpretation of Hokmah’s shadowless nature we can look at it from another perspective.

On a theological level this claim may be of little consequence, how ever symbolically and from the perspective of analytical psychology, it indicates that ev en at the highest levels of consciousness or spiritual attainment the shadow still exists in some manner; the brighter the light the darker the shadow that is cast. This approach to Hokmah (and by extension the same applies to Kether ) reveals that no matter how close we may come to know the divine we are still bound to the human condition. The Esotericists, operating from their own spiritual world-view, are able to make any metaphysical claim they like without neces sarily dealing with empirical suppositions or observations as Jung had attempted to do throughout his life. Knight informs us “if anyone claims to be of the esoteric grade of Magus or Ipsissimus, the grades assigned to Chokmah and Kether, he proclaims himself either as a Christ, a liar, or a fool.” 36 It would appear that the grades of the Supernal Triad have little literal personal or pragmatic meaning from an analytical psyc hological perspective. How can Jung’s model account for a person who lives w ithout a shadow? A person who, as an emissary of the dynamic creative force of the universe, can dire ct the unfolding of reality? The answer is, of course, it cannot nor should it as it is a method of sustained psychological introspection and therapy and cannot support such an assumption.

The corresponding spiritual experience is the Union with God 38 ; with the virtue being the completion of the Great Work (as with Hokmah there is no corresponding vice).

Fortune emphasised that in our stage of development Kether and its associated experiences 41 are the Great Unknown but it is no t the Great Unknowable . 42 While it may be “latency only one degree removed from non-existence” 43 , it still remains as a potential for human psycho-spiritual maturation.

It is “the intensest form of existence, pure being unlimited by form or reaction; but it is existence of anothe r type than that to which we are accustomed, and therefore it appears to us as non-existence because it conforms to none of the requirements we are accustomed to think of as determining existence.” 45 We can see that there are parallels between this description of Kether with the Buddhist notion of “mind- only” in citta-m ā tra and “Buddha Mind” 46 or the sam ā dhi ( Nirvikalpa-sam ā dhi ) of Vedantic philosophy; a state where there is no di scursive mind, duality, or subject-object relations. With such lofty reaches of human consciousness we can clearly see how the theories of transpersonal psychology will be helpful in better understanding what the Kether of the Esoteric Tree of Life is and what it means for Jung’s theories. Synchronicity, the Unus Mundus , and Transpersonal Psychology While Jung did devote an impressive portion of the Collected Works to subjects we could label “transpersonal” (for exampl e his work on synchronicity and mysticism), he remained concerned with terms such as “universal consciousness” he encountered in his studies of Eastern spiritual traditions: One hopes to control the unconscious, but the past masters in the art of self-control, the yogis, attain perfection in sam ā dhi , a state of ecstasy, which so far as we know is equivalent to a state of unconsciousness.

They do not realize that a “universal consciousness” is a contradiction in terms, since exclusion, selection, and discrimination are the root and es sence of everything that lays claim to the name “consciousness.” “Universal consciousness” is logically identical with the unconscious. 47 The above citation exposes the primary analytical psycholo gical argument facing our interpretation of the West ern Esoteric Tree of Life’s portrayal of psychological maturation and what amounts to the process of psychological initiation. If the Supernal Triad represents the transpersonal collective unconscious (again it is not the collective unconscious, it is a metaphor for what Jung labelled the colle ctive unconscious), how can we possibly know anything at all about it and what possible use does it hold? From the boundaries of a professional clinical perspec tive, the importance of the Supernal Triad may not be great. However, outside of the parameters of analytical practice, the experience of the archetypes of the collectiv e unconscious, especially when experienced within the context of a highly symbolic psycho-spiritual system, can hold spiritual meaning. When we reviewed Kether we noticed that Fortune states that the sefira is the Great Unknown but not the Great Unknowable. 48 The implication is that at some point in human development we may well co me to know (or at least know more of) the Unknown, the unconscious, in a more intimate and persona l manner. Jung states that “[e]ven today we know of primitive tribes whose levels of consciousness is not so far removed from the darkness of the primordial psyche, and numinous vestiges of this st ate can still be found among civilized people.

Today so-called “average people” can delve into the pe rsonal and the collective uncon scious with a modicum of guidance and a great deal of patience. Also mentioned above was that the experience of Kether is one that is not easily transferred to th e concrete language of “existence” or what we would label consciousness. Jung echoes a similar position when he discusses the psychic nature of the anima and animus: The anima and animus live in a world quite different from the world outside—in a world where the pulse of time beats infinitely slowly, where the birth and death of individuals count for little. No wonder their nature is strange, so strange that their irruption into consciousness often amount s to a psychosis. They undoubtedly belong to the material that comes to light in schizophrenia. 51 Another important area of J ung’s thought that should be re viewed in relation to the transpersonal facets of the psyche is the idea of the unus mundus or “One World”. The Unus Mundus as Transpersonal Experience Even though Jung questioned, at least on philosophical grounds, the idea of trans- egoic universal consciousness in his theories, he was certainly not averse to the idea of an underlying unity to reality that appears to resemble the characteristics of Kether . Drawing from the esoteric writings of the alchemists, Jung turned his attention to the unus mundus or the “One World”. In Chapter Two we briefly analysed how the unus   49 Jung, “Transformation Symbolism in the Mass”, CW 11, par. 442. 50 Page 168. 51 Jung, “Conscious, Unconscious, and Individuation”, CW 9i, par. 519."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 260 mundus was utilised in alchemy and, in turn, how the concept fit in Jung’s theories. 52 To reiterate, Edinger describes the unus mundus as representing “the union of the ego with the Self and with the world...” 53 This process would be the equivalent of the union of Malkut and Tiferet on the Esoteric Tree of Life along the ego-self axis. As an archetype, the self is transpersonal, that is to say it has the potential to be experienced by all people at any time. However, the sense of the unus mundus as a specific psychological factor occurs below the Supernal Abyss. A post-Supernal Abyss unus mundus would equate to what we are referring to as the ego/self-collective unconscious axis. The former (pre- Supernal Abyss) experience re sonates with Edinger’s statem ent that “once you are totally in it you are out of the ego world as we know it.” 54 The latter (post- Supernal Abyss) would imply that the “you” that is “totally in it” has been divested of any sense of a separate ego, “ego world” or self. Jung tells us that the unus mundus is “not a fusion of th e individual with his environment, or even his adaptation to it, but a unio mystica with the potential world.” 55 This would imply that rather than Tiferet (the self), it is Kether which best summarises the nature of the unus mundus . The pure potential of Kether is manifest in the psyche and proceeds past Da’at , through Tiferet , then through Yesod , finally to be experienced or concretised in Malkut (ego-complex). Again, it is a matte r of perspective and degree of experience. Hypothetically, the unus mundus is the equivalent of Kether —a unified field of transpersonal experience.

We are unable to diverge too far into synchronicity, as it is a subject worthy of volumes of work in and of itself but we will attempt to cover some of the more relevant points. 56 Synchronicity is the unifying factor of the unus mundus where the boundaries between time, matter and causality collapse. There are similar assumptions behind “Ipsissimus (10=1)”, the grade corresponding to Kether . On May 23 1921, Crowley took the initiation of Ipsissimus and record ed in his diary: “As God goes, I go.” 57 Regardless of the validity of Crowley’s claim to Ipsiss imus, we see that the grade corresponding to Kether and the potentiality of the unus mundus implies, through the merging of a human identity with “divinity” or th e numinous nature of the collective unconscious, a unity of cause and effect and a state of interpenet ration of microcosm and macrocosm where human individuality and divi nity become inseparable.

This whole process occu rs within the context of meaning . There is a prerequisite of meani ng necessary for synchronicity to be differentiated from coincidence. Accordi ng to Roderick Main, Jung suggests in his theory of synchronicity: a possible psychological dynamic to explain how an activated archetype might result in synchroni cities: the presence of the active archetype is accompanied by numinous effects, and this numinosity or affectivity results in a lowering of the mental level, a relaxing of the focus of consciousness. As the energy of consciousness is lowered, the energy of the unconscious is correspondingly heightened, so that a gradient from the unconscious to the conscious is established and unconscious contents flow into consciousness more readily than usual. Included among these unconscious contents are items of what Jung calls ‘absolute knowledge’, knowledge that transcends the space— time limitations of consciousness... 61 Aside from the numinous effect of synchronic ity and its potential to reveal ‘absolute knowledge’ what is of interest here is the view of synchronicity acting as a point of transcendence where space, time and, as synchroni city is ‘acausal’, causality collapse or implode upon themselves.

Mansfi eld has undertaken a difficult task in his writings on synchronicity. As a scientist, a physicis t and astronomer, and as one who is deeply committed to exploring various avenues of spirit uality, Mansfield attempts to bridge what he labels head and heart . One way of trying to accomplish this task is through Jung’s theory of synchronicity. As a theory, synchronicity participates on both a scientific level and a spiritual level. It participates on a sc ientific level through its relation to scientific disciplines such as quantum mechanics and its understanding of the intrinsic subjectivity evident in seemingly objective re ality. Synchronicity also br ings into light the problem of temporality and causality; another focus of the more theoretical reaches of physics. 62 There are also, of course, the experiment s into parapsychology and so-called “psi” research. 63 The “heart” facility of synchronicity can be best defined by paraphrasing the seven attributes of “Synchronicity as an expression of transformative self-knowledge” given in Mansfield’s Head and Heart . 64 Mansfield indicates that synchronicity represents self-knowledge as can be seen through the following se ven characteristics; synchronicity is intuitive, hol istic, unique to the individual, transforming, unrepeatable, teleological, and sacred:   62 For more detailed studies of the connection between physics and synchronicity see Mansfield, Head and Heart and Synchronicity, Science and Soul-Making and von Franz Number and Time .

Van Eenwyk, Archetypes and Strange Attractors: The Chaotic World of Symbols (Toronto, ON: Inner City Books, 1997). 63 However, we should keep in mind the differentiation Mansfield makes between paranormal researches and synchronicity.

Synchronicity experiences always involve an interior intuition from our “deepest subjectivity” which is applied to the external event which constitutes the synchronistic experience. 2. Synchronicity is holistic in that it influences our whole being, life and purpose and a synchronicity experience “gives us a personal expression of the unity underlying soul and matter.” 3. Synchronicity experiences are conditioned by collective archetypes; however, the meaning of the archetype is always unique to the individual and their individuation process. 4. The synchronicity experience occu rs within the context of an individual’s individuation proc ess and, if the person who experiences synchronicity attemp ts to understand its meaning, he/she has the potential for personal transformation. 5. One cannot repeat a synchronicity experience since the context which brought forth the compensatory occurrence in the first place will not be repeated; at least not in the same manner. 6. A teleological paradigm is already implied within the process of individuation and the compensato ry nature of the unconscious. The synchronicity experience seems to indicate that there is “a timeless ‘vision’ of what the self demands of us.” 7. A true synchronicity experien ce is always accompanied by a numinous experience and it therefor e takes the form of sacred knowledge. There is a sense of providence and superior knowledge not bound by our individual ego perspective. 65 Of particular interest for our current context is the idea that synchronicity is part of self- knowledge and the idea that it is a point where seemingly divergent concepts and constructs become blurred and, in essence, blen d with each other. We shall return to this idea below when we look at how the “pseudo- sefira ” Da’at can be interpreted as a metaphor of synchronicity and the underlying pa ttern of reality. This symbol links both the macrocosmic realms of the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life and the microcosmic world of causality.   65 For more on synchronicity as spiritual experience see Roderick Main, “Synchronicity as a Form of Spiritual Experience” (Ph.D. diss., Lancaster University, 1995)."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 265 The importance and impact of the theory of synchronicity on Jung’s thought, especially his later work, is no small issue. Main’s book The Rupture of Time systematically demonstrates the connection between the theory of synchronicity and many of the other facets of Jung’s theories and thought. Of specific importance to our current analysis is Main’s sy nthesis of Jung’s theory of sy nchronicity and the “spiritual revolution.” 66 Synchronicity, as an “a causal connecting principle” is an integral aspect of Jung’s thought due to the fact that it unifies the obj ective, external world and the subjective interiority of the psyche. A sync hronistic experience is an experience of the underlying unity of existence. This unity can be taken even further where “the sense of unity can be experienced as existing not ju st between the psychic and the physical but between the psychophysical as a whole and a tran scendent, spiritual, or divine aspect of reality.” 67 This unity is the unus mundus and, we can extrapolate, the experience symbolised by Kether as the highest point of the Supernal Triad. Main recounts Jung’s visi on of this type of unity, 68 though he emphasises that since it does not involve an ex ternal physical event it does not fall under Jung’s more common definition of synchronic ity. The vision occurred af ter Jung had broken his foot and suffered a heart attack in 1944. While the content of the vision is not important, at least for our current purposes, th e affect the visions had on Jung is important.

This is no t recounted as a person experiencing a union with another state of being but rather the realisation of the individual as being imbedded in a transpersonal unity. Main further focuses on the conn ection between Jung’s experience and synchronicity: In his fuller account of the vision, Jung characterises it in terms of ‘a quality of absolute objectivity’ and of ‘a non-temporal state in which present, past and future are one’. This characterisation clearly reflects the ‘absolute knowledge’ and ‘space-time relativity’ involved in synchroniciti es. Further, his sense of his visions as representing a kind of mystic marriage between self and world—the hierosgamos or mysterium coniunctionis —suggests that they may constitute an expe riential realisation of the unitary dimension of existence (the unus mundus ) towards which he considered the more familiar forms of synchronicity to be pointing. 70 This “unitary dimension” can be fu rther linked to the “realisation of Tao” 71 which parallels the unity implied with Kether and the Yin and Yang of Binah and Hokmah respectively. A central aspect of synchr onicity is that it unites th e individual with the world around them. Rather than living entirely “in the head” as a uniquely psychic occurrence, synchronicity reveals that an intricate tapestry of interconnectedness surrounds the individual on an exopsychic and endopsychic level.

Jung’s Psychology of Religion and Synchronicity : For Jung, as evidenced by his own writings on synchronicity and, perhaps more importantly, by the way he lived his own life, the individuation process extends be yond the psychological realm and assumes the character of a drama th at takes the whole of nature for its stage. What we normally regard as the discontinuous inner and outer worlds become enclosed within the same circle of wholeness. Inwardly and outwardly nature works, through the compensatory patterning of events, to further the movement of the individual towards wholeness. 72 Synchronicity not only blurs the boundari es between space and time and causality, potentially theoretical and recondite issues , it also makes a meaningful contribution towards blurring the boundaries between what is considered “I” and “not I”. Given our collective human tendency to discriminate the compensatory lessons present within a synchronicity experience are important ones indeed. Though the Western Esoteric Tradition do es not present the level of academic study on synchronicity as can be found within the literature of analytical psychology, the Tradition is not without some of its own insights as we shall now see. Da’at as “In-between” Thus far we have defined the sefirot as middoth or qualities. From traditional theistic perspectives they are qualities of God or gods and from a psychological perspective the sefirot can be seen as symbolic of th e qualities of the largely unconscious psyche. However, standing in a unique and rather bemusing position is the pseudo- sefira Da’at . Earlier we encountered Da’at in reference to the Supernal Abyss where,   72 Aziz, C.G.

Yet this view is only one possible interpretation of Da’at . This pseudo- sefira can be interpreted in other ways —ways that reflect its metaphoric neither/nor and transitional nature. The more ne gative-sounding interpretations of Da’at come from sources such as Crowley and Grant; while descriptions of Da’at which are less threatening and more beneficent can be found in sources such as Fortune and Knight. The primary difference between these two school s of thought, at leas t on this issue, is their specific views on the value of consciousness and thought. For Crowley individual egoi c consciousness was somethi ng to be overcome in a deliberate and diligent manner. Crowley wa s heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy and religion, though his interpretations can be idiosyncratic. 73 The Eastern influence is most obvious in his perspectiv e on knowledge, thought and mind. In general, we can see that Crowley viewed the seemingly defined rea lity of thought and personality as illusory. We find some relevant material from the Book of Lies . In “Dragons” the relationship of ego and the transpersonal state of Sam ā dhi are likened to the solar system: Thought is the shadow of the eclipse of Luna. Samadhi is the shadow of the eclipse of Sol. The moon and the earth are the non-ego and the ego: the Sun is THAT. Both eclipses are darkne ss; both are exceeding rare; the Universe itself is Light. 74   73 For examples of Crowley’s use of Eastern traditions of thought see: Crowley, Tao Te Ching (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1995), Eight Lectures on Yoga (2 nd edition, AZ: New Falcon Publications, 1991), Magick/Liber Aba , 7-44, and “Science and Buddhism” in Collected Works of Aleister Crowley, Vol.II (rpt. Des Plaines, IL: Yogi Publication Society, c.1974), 244-261. Alan Bennett (1872- 1923) was a friend, mentor and confidant of Crowley during his time with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

Only the Universe or the Universal (i.e. transpersonal) perspective, according to this poem, is the Light or substance. 75 Again in The Book of Lies we see Crowley’s view that personal consciousness (personal identity) is a hindrance to th e more “real” transpersonal forms of consciousness: Dreams are imperfections of sleep; even so is con- sciousness the imperfection of waking. Dreams are impurities in the circulation of the blood; even so is consciousness a disorder of life. Dreams are without proportion, without good sense, without truth; so also is consciousness. Awake from the dream, the truth is known: awake from waking, the Truth is—The Unknown. 76 This poem, “John-A-Dreams”, implies that pers onal ego consciousness is a flawed form of awareness and only by waking from the view that the sense of personal consciousness is “truth” can we come to experience the “T he Unknown” as “Truth”. This view of consciousness permeates many of Crowley’s spiritual assumpti ons. This, we can assume, is one of the reasons why the Supe rnal Abyss, the demon Choronzon and Da’at are given such negative connotations in Crowley’s cosmology.

However, his is not the only interpretation. Gareth Knight gives a different interpretation of Da’at from that of Crowley. In A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism Knight states that the “...Mysteries of Daath are profound and were little touched on in earlier writings on the Qabalah.” 77 Knight also indicates that while Da’at is translated as “Knowledge” it is “meant not so much what we understand by the word, but the word in its bi blical usage of sexual union, only here the meaning is a kind of Divine Union where the di ffering planes of being impact and there is a resultant change of state brought to birth—a transformation or transmutation of power.” 78 Further in A Practical Guide , Knight expounds on the nature of Da’at more fully: Daath is the highest point of awar eness of the huma n soul regarded as a soul for awareness of the s upernal levels can only be possible to the Spirit or Divine Spark itself....Before the grade of Daath the experience of a soul is devoted to bringing about a fusion of itself with the Spirit—to ‘becoming’. After the powers of Daath are fully operational in a soul there is no further process of ‘becoming’ for that soul ‘ is ’....Daath, then, is the sphere of Realisation in its supremest meaning, understanding united with knowledge...the human mind at this most abstract level attains to a complete awareness of All and in this comp lete awareness is absorbed by the Eternal Mind and made one with it, so that Daath, as a Sephirah, represents supreme Wisdom and supreme Power of Realisation. 79 In the above citation Da’at is far from demonic; it is a heightened state of spiritual awareness.

Yet Knight admits there is also a darker side to Da’at and the following citation has an overtly though unorthodox, psychoanalytic tone to it: There is also a dark side of Daath relating to what might be called the subconscious mind of God and this could have strange results on the soul. Contacts with the personal subconscious can be disturbing enough, so one can we ll imagine how much more explosive would be contacts w ith the Universal Subconscious, containing the whole past history and inner stresses of the Logos. 80 On the surface the major differe nce between Crowley’s view of Da’at and that of Knight is the use of Christocen tric terms such as Soul, Spirit, and Logos. For Crowley no matter how enlightened the individual pers pective is, to cling to the notion of individuality is still a limited perspective. Knight, on the other hand, sees that the Supernal experiences are not ones for human souls but they are reserved on the “inner planes” of pure spirit. Like the problem of applying the experiences of the Magus and Ipsissimus grades to “this worldly” consciousness, finding common ground between these two perspectives of the Esoteric Tr ee of Life is fraught with difficulties. Dion Fortune gives a description of Da’at that is similar to Knight’s perspective (or more precisely, Knight’s perspective re flects Fortune’s). Fortune states that Da’at : is that mind which is clear, simple and certain and which links and understands both sides of the Abyss . Daath represents the Unity which links the Principles (i.e. th e Supernal Triangle. ed. [sic]) with their manifestation—the mind of God working through Man and Evolution. We are here consid ering, as with all the Sephiroth, the Sephirah in Malkuth. 81 In Fortune’s description we find a common link between each of the descriptions of Da’at presented thus far. Da’at is a position or state of “in-between”. Da’at is the height   80 Knight, A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism , v.

It is the demon Choronzon and it is the “Supreme Power of Realis ation.” It is the link between divinity and humanity, yet it is neither. As a pseudo- sefira with no number, Da’at cannot be included as a middoth of God yet it is a central part of psycho-spiritual transformation and initiation. From the perspe ctive of analyt ical psychology, Da’at is the boundary between the process of individuation of the individual and the underlying unus mundus of the collective unconscious. Da’at is a symbol of the perpetual state of flux which we label psyche. Even though we employ terms such as ego-complex, shadow, anima or animus, or the self, there is, at the root, a st ate of flux, malleability and interpenetration. Da’at is the quality of the psyche that is not a quality, and it is the key to synchronicity, that link between the depths of our co llective psyches and the external world. 82 Kenneth Grant’s work Outside the Circles of Time 83 , while inundated with his own unique perspectives, reflects this aspect of Da’at . Interestingly, Grant opens Outside the Circles of Time with a reference to synchronicity. Grant begins Outside the Circles of Time with a discussion of Crowley’s Aeonic model of time. Crowley posited that there were three Aeons. 84 The first Aeon was matriarchic, agrarian and nature oriented and is symbolised by Crowley as the Egyptian goddess Isis. The second Aeon is symbolised by Osiris and was marked by the dominance of the dying and re surrecting god and patriarchy. Christianity would be the ultimate example of an Osirian tradition. The third and current Aeon, at least according to Crowley, is the Aeon of Horus; this is the Aeon of th e divine child inaugurated by   82 Or perhaps even more disturbing is that Da’at might be an insidious Deleuzian rhizome trying to dismantle every Tree of Life from within its own structure with synchronicity as its byproduct. 83 Kenneth Grant, Outside the Circles of Time (Great Britain: Frederick Muller, Ltd., 1980). 84 See Crowley, The Law is for All and Magick/Liber Aba for a more thorough treatment of the Aeons."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 273 Crowley with the reception of Liber AL vel Legis in 1904. Rather than concerning ourselves with Thelemic cosmology we need only understand that there is a linear motion to the Aeons; each being comprised of roughly two thousand years. It is this assumption of temporal linearity that Grant attempts to usurp from Crowley and which is most relevant for us. For exam ple we find Grant state: It is now known, however, that the apparently anomalous coincidence of two or more aeons occurring simultaneously is not an impossibility when time is considered to be, not a linear sequence of events or spaces, but a perichoresis , an intrusion into the present space of the past and future, which involves an implosion of synchronicity. 85 Unfortunately Grant does not elaborate on this use of sync hronicity. He only continues relating this issue and other Kabbalistic constructs instead to his ow n particular view of the Tree of Life. Following Grant, Da’at , then, can be seen as “the point both of ingress into the noumenon and of egress into phenomena ; in other words it is the gateway of the manifestation of non-manifestation.” 86 Both Da’at and synchronicity are examples of states or occurrences that exist outside the standard understandi ng of linearity, causality and subjectivity. They reflect a position of connectivity between seemingly unconnected realms of experience. Synchronicity points to a reality outside of the subjective psyche an d draws the individual into a connection not only with the external “objective” world but, as Jung indicates, with the potential world of the unus mundus .

For the Western Esot ericists it can either be seen as a refined form of consciousness or the last semblan ce of individuality before attaining the transpersonal realms of the Supernal Triad. The concept of unus mundus is a difficult one to expr ess without resorting to poetic language. It was a term used in al chemy and related esoteric traditions to communicate a non-dual transpersonal state of consciousne ss and of being. Edinger states that “the assumption is that the final, total translati on to unity is consummated only at death—at best, that is, because death doe sn’t automatically bring it about either.” 87 It is clear that the unus mundus is a potential psychological stat e wherein adjectives such as unity, transpersonal and synchr onicity prevail.

While it is true that Jung was a psychologi st and a scientist, he was also dedicated to exploring fields of interest that lay outside the general boundaries of science and psychology. 88 Jung was not satisfied with mainta ining a reductionistic outlook in his   87 Edinger, The Mysterium Lectures , 283-284. 88 Jung was interest in subjects such as extra-sensory perception (see “Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle”, CW 8 , pars. 838, 840, 848, 855, 863, 907, 913, 947, 954, 966, 994; “Fundamental Questions of Psychotherapy”, CW 16 , par. 254), parapsychology (“The Future of Pararpsychology”, CW 18 ) and spiritualism (see “On Spiritualistic Phenomenon”, CW 18 , pars. 697-640; “Psychology and Spiritualism”, CW 18 , pars. 746-756; and, of course, “On the Psychology of So-Called Occult Phenomena”, CW 1 , pars. 1-150)."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 275 model of the psyche. 89 Given Jung’s writings on subjects like synchronicity, alchemy and mysticism we could even go so far as, as has Leon Schlamm, to claim that Jung was a scientist as well as a detraditionalised mystic. 90 In his article “C .G. Jung’s Visionary Mysticism” Schlamm utilises a taxonomic mode l of mystical traditions developed by Andrew Rawlinson in his book The Book of Enlightened Ma sters: Western Teachers in Eastern Traditions . 91 This taxonomy is comprised of two sets of polarities: Hot / Cool and Structured / Unstructured . A mystical tradition can be categorised as Cool Structured / Cool Unstructured or Hot Structured / Hot Unstructured . Let us take a moment to review Rawlinson’s taxonomy. Rawlinson’s taxonomy is summarised as follows 92 : Hot That which is other than oneself; th at which has its own life. It is not something that one has access to as of right. It is powerful and breath-taking, and is associated with revelation and grace. It is very similar to Otto’s numinous. Cool The very essence of oneself; one need not go to another to find it. Hence one does have access to it as a right. It is quiet and still, and is associated with self-realisation. Structured There is an inherent order in the cosmos and therefore in the human condition. There is something to be discovered and there is a way of discovering it. A map is requi red to find the destination. Unstructured There is no gap between the starti ng point and the finishing post. Method and goal are identical. We are not separate from reality/truth/God and so no map is re quired. Everything is available now and always has been.   89 This is especially the case with Jung’s view of th e rigidity of Freud’s model.

Schlamm highlights an important issue in regards to Rawlinson’s view of the mystical traditions that fall within these quadrants. 93 He states that these “types of mystical traditions are for Rawlinson all tr ue because they provide equally effective vehicles for spiritual emancipation. This is the reason for Rawlin son’s attribution of equal value to competing soteriological tradi tions and for his refusal to countenance any privileging of any particul ar spiritual perspective.” 94 Related to this egalitarian approach to the various mystical traditions is Rawlin son’s insistence that these quadrants are not rigid and that individual teache rs and traditions have, in fact, been lo cated in several of the quadrants. According to Schlamm the valu e of Rawlinson’s model “is that it can be used to help differentiate among an am azing variety of spir itual perspectives.” 95 The Upper Left: Hot Structured traditions see the cosmos as being comprised of a myriad of powerful beings with spiritual advancement being atta ined through knowledge of arcane information. The teaching thr ough which one may come to know this information is initiatory and ne ver given or available all at once but is attained only when it is necessary and is presented in a cryptic form. This type of cosmology is typical for forms of esotericism and we can see obvious pa rallels to the Wester n Esoteric Tradition. These traditions are hierarchical and require the practitioner to apply volition to break through spiritual ba rriers. These Hot Structured traditions also employ magic or the manipulation of the cosmos in the service of self-transformation. In these traditions   93 Schlamm also uses Rawlinson’s taxonomy in his article “Ken Wilber’s Spectrum Model: Identifying Alternative Soteriological Perspectives”, Religion 31 (2001): 19-39.

The individual spiritual qualitie s are ecstatic and unpredictabl e and the social spiritual qualities are described as a whirlwind of projects.

The complimentary pole is the Lower Left: Cool Structured traditions. In these traditions liberation is found not in the objec tive universe but within oneself and can be accessed through dedicated practice. There is a dispassionate and restrained approach within the traditions with th eir practice being graduated an d gentle while the individual spiritual qualities are unpr etentious and simple.

The Upper Right: Hot Unstructured traditions include such traditions as Chaitanya , Pure Land Buddhism, Sufism, Christian my sticism (St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross). Here we have the notion of an obj ective divine power that both encloses the practitioner and is the source of liberation and that libe ration comes from love and submission to the divine power. Consciousness is seen as divine and universal and humans are nothing before G od. Individual spiritual qual ities are giving love and responding to the love of others, while the soci al spiritual qualities ar e serving the divine. In the Hot Unstructured traditions humans are always fa iling but they need only ask the divine for assistance since love is freely given to all that ask (and in some cases even to those who do not ask). 99 Finally we come to the Lower Right: Cool Unstructured traditions. These traditions include Advaita Vedanta , Ramana Maharshi, Dzogchen, Mahamudra , Zen, Taoism and Madhyamika Buddhism. In this case one’s own nature is liberation and all else is illusion including the universe and all thi ngs in it.

The first feature is “Jung’ s archetype of rebirt h, the experience of death (before you die) followed by rebirth is a common feature of Hot Structured and Unstructured traditions.” 103 The second feature is Jung’s expe rience as a wounded healer; another common feature found in both Hot traditions. 104 Schlamm anticipates the potential argument for placing Jung in a Cool Structured tradition.

The first is that “one might assume that because Hot is other than oneself, it is not an intrapsychic experience.” 105 Yet, as Schlamm reminds us, the experiences related by Rawlins on in his four quadrants are all intra-psychic with the difference lying in how “oneself” is defined. 106 For the Hot traditions “oneself” “means human consciousness, psyche, or soul, whereas in the Cool traditions it means the absolute impersonal spirit.” 107 One aspect of Jung’s thought that differentiates him from a Cool Structured tradition is his emphasis on “imagina ry/visionary experience as a tool for spiritual transformation” that put him at odds with the “finally tuned, spiritual technologies seeking to tr anscend all images, thoughts, impulses, and desires.” 108 Schlamm stresses that archetypal images are numinous and wholly other to the ego. 109 The confrontation with the collective unconscious, 110 as indicated in Jung’s writings, orients Jung in the Hot rather than the Cool spiritual traditions. 111 For Schlamm this is illustrated “in the theistic orientation of [Jung’s] writings and his rejection of non- dualism.” 112 The second reason Jung’s t hought might be mistaken as Cool Structured is because of his scientific claims made in his clinical work. 113 However, Schlamm reminds us that Jung was critical of his contemporary reductionistic science “as illustrated by the influence of Romantic Naturphilosophie on his work and his writings   105 Schlamm, “C.G.

This indi fference, if not hostility, to Cool Unstructured traditions is evinced in his writings on India, 116 as well as by his refusal, against th e advice Heinrich Zimmer and Paul Brunton, to meet Rama Maharshi, the Cool Unstructured Advaita Vedanta teacher, when in India in 1938.” 117 Schlamm has presented us with a constructive interpretation of Jung’s psychological model as an example of a secular or detraditionaised Hot Structured spiritual tradition. He indicates that while the mind-body dichotomy may not be prevalent in the East, it is still a component of Western culture. Schl amm states that “[i]t is for this reason that I believe the West today is in greater need of Hot Structured traditions, which focus attention on mind-body-spirit integration, than of Cool Structured soteriological paths.” 118 The sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life participate in a Hot Structured manner.

What follo ws is a description of the Negative Veils of Existence from various Western Esoteric sources as well as a proposal as to how these Veils relate to the theories of analytical psychology. Though the lower portions of the Tree of Li fe may appear to be its foundation, it is actually the upper extremities of the Tree that are its roots of the Tree and even Kether , the highest or deepest sefira has its roots in a still deeper source. The Western Esotericists, following Jewish Kabbalah, have labelled this three-tiered source Ain Sof Aur , Ain Sof and finally Ain . 1 These three “Negative Veils of Existence” are even more abstract than the sefirot or the Supernal Triad.

Ain Sof Aur , Ain Sof , Ain or The Real Collective Unconscious Although the Veils have the adjective “N egative” applied to them and despite their abstract nature, we should not assume that they are devoid of function or value. At the same time though, the Esotericists do not e xpend a great deal of energy in trying to describe the Veils. Their abstract nature is accessible only “in that region of consciousness which transcends thought” and wh ile the mystics of ma ny traditions will attempt to describe or detail these higher realms of consciousness, the Kabbalists, so   1 The spelling of these terms, like all the Hebrew wo rds used within the Western Esoteric Tradition varies from source to source."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 285 Fortune assumes, “content themselves with saying the Absolute is unknown to the state of consciousness which is normal to human beings.” 2 Ultimately the Esotericists seem to imply that the sefirot , including Kether , are somehow within the reach, spiritually or psychologically, of the human being. Somehow we can transf orm ourselves in order to become closer to God, Unity, or Totalit y. The Veils, on the other hand, are wholly beyond out capacity to comprehe nd or experience directly. Even though the Esotericists do not atte mpt to cultivate a complex system of metaphors and correspondences for the “Absolute” as they have for the sefirot , they do recognise some justification in engaging in at least a cursory form of symbolic discourse. Dion Fortune states that “[w]e must clearly r ealise that in these hi ghly abstract regions the mind can use nothing but symbols; but these symbols have the power to convey realisations to minds that know how to use them; these symbols ar e the seeds of thought whence understanding arises, even if we are not able to expand the symbol itself into a concrete realisation.” 3 Even though there may not be a conscious comprehension of the Veils, Fortune indicates that there should still be an attempt to engage with the symbols or metaphors which, however abstract, represent the Veils. In another citation, Fortune discus ses the Unknown/Unknowable issue that was discussed in the previous chapter. Fortune believes, following a standard Hot Structured and perennial outlook, that given enough time and development, these Veils may become more accessible to human consciousness: Little by little, like a rising tide, realisation is concreting [sic] the Abstract, assimilating and expressi ng in terms of its own nature things which belong to another sp here; and we shall make a great mistake if we try to prove with Herbert Spencer that because a   2 Dion Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah (Boston, MA: Weiser Books, 2000), 27 . 3 Fortune, The Mystical Qabalah, 32."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 286 thing is unknown by any capacity of the mind we at present possess, that it must for ever be Unknowable.

This may or may not be the ca se and it is not our place to attempt to prove or disprove this claim. The Negativ e Veils are metaphors or symbols for concepts of a vast and utterly non-dual nature. Fortune recounts that the Kabbalists state “Kether is the Malkuth of the Unmanifest” 6 indicating, at least on one level, that there is a graduation of transpersonal experience or consciousness which can occur beyond Kether though this may point more to a distant evolutional potential rather than something that can occur presently. The capacity to appreciate and appropriate the symbol of the Negative Veils would appear to be rather subjective and would likely vary from person to person. Fortune claims: [D]ifferent minds go back different distances, and that for some the Veil is drawn in one place, and for others in another. The ignorant [sic] goes no further back than th e concept of God as an old man with a long white beard who sa t on a golden throne and gave orders for creation.

Gareth Knight offers little additional de tail to the nature of the Negative Veils other than a general concurrence with Fort une’s view. Knight does posit, again through his particular Cosmic Christological reading of the Western Esoteric Tradition that the Veils correspond to a link with the forces outside our “Solar Logoidal” jurisdiction. 8 Knight also reinforces a description of the Negative Veils of Existence given by Fortune. Fortune writes that an adept once told her that “God is pressure” 9 and Knight claims that one useful speculative meditation is to use the idea that the Veils are “a vacuum of pressure.” 10 Kabbalistically, this idea resonates with notion of tzimtzum in Isaac Luria’s thought. Scholem tells us that “ Tsimtsum does not mean the concentration of God at a point, but his retreat away from a point. What does this mean? It means briefly that the existence of the universe is made possible by a process of shrinkage in God.” 11 There is a sense that the Negative Veils displace or in some way impose th emselves onto the sefirot of the Tree of Life in much the same way the archetypes of the collective unconscious can impose themselves on consciousness.

The lower sefirot participate in the process of developing the whole in dividual. Similarly, the process of individuation is an interplay between the ego-complex ( Malkut ) and the various archetypal images experienced along the psychological Path of the Serpent (such as the sefirot that comprise the self-mandala). At this level the transpersonal experience resembles, at least from the metaphorical descriptions of the Esotericists, as a theistic dialogue or a Hot Structured form of mysticism. The Supernal Triad, on th e other hand, is representative of those transpersonal realms of consciousness wher e the boundaries between individual and other are absent. This would be more akin to the Cool Structured traditions. This, of course, is not how many of the Esoteric ists would describe the pro cesses of the Tree; primarily this would be the case with Esotericists like Crowley who were influenced by Eastern traditions that fall under the Cool Structured heading.

Ultimately the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology are two diverse a nd independent systems or models of psycho-spiritual development. The former is a spiritual and/ or mystical tradition that is concerned with the initiatory progress of the individual th rough various psycho-spir itual experiences or markers while the latter is a recognised and accredited form of depth psychology with its own history and specific re quirements and assumptions. However different these traditions may be, they are both concerned with the systematic exploration of the metaphorical realms of the psyche in all it complexity and numinosity. Routes of Wholeness: A Summary The Western Esoteric Tradition claims and upholds certain presuppositions and many of these presuppositions are reflected in the sefirot of the Tree of Life. One claim made by the Tradition is that ultimate rea lity is beyond our “normal” human perception and consciousness. Despite this fact, the Esot ericists believe that it is possible to widen and to deepen how human consciousness is defined. They ac complish the feat, so they assert, through training in the use of medita tion, visualisation, ritual, and, as had been proposed throughout this thesis , through the vehicle that un ites all of these—metaphor. The further reaches of this widening consciousness flow into psycho-spiritual realms that move beyond the boundaries of individuality into transpersonal domains of increasing"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 290 non-dual abstraction. The sefirot and the Tree of Life are symbols that help define or give quality to that which is othe rwise unconscious to the initiate. Analytical psychology is also concer ned with avoiding a rigidly defined consciousness. While the development and di fferentiation of the ego-complex and the source of individuality are a central component of analytical psychology, there remains another goal and that goal is the cultivati on of wholeness where both the conscious self and the personal and collective unconscious pa rticipate in a dialogue . The language that is spoken during this dialogue is one of sy mbol and metaphor. This dialogue requires that the ego-complex must realise that it is not the centre of psyche. While the ego- complex may be the centre of consciousness, its identity and definition is not as central once the symbolic influence of the unconscious , not to mention the underlying unity of the unus mundus and the correlated theory of synchronicity, are taken into consideration. Both the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology attempt to define and engage with the development of human consciousness without attempting to reduce consciousness to the simple conste llation of molecules and cells. 15 Both find merit in the less tangible human realms of symbols and soul. By placing these two similar yet ultimately distinct traditions in relation to one another we can anticipate a meaningful and mutually informative dialogue. There are two general areas or themes through which the Western Esoteric Tree of Life has attempted to bring together the Western Esoteric Tradition and analytical psychology in comparison. These two areas could be simply labelled theory and   15 That is not to say that the materialist approach to consciousness is not important. Obviously a biological or biochemical understanding of the workings of the brain is essential for health and further human evolution. However, whereas analytical psychology can find meaning in both the materialist model and still appreciate the necessity of symbol and psyche, the materialist model is much less open to an equal appreciation."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 291 application. These two areas ar e offered to present potential areas of departure for further research. Theory If we take the Tree to be a symbol or metaphor for the psyche we see that the sefirot are both individual and unique while at the same time each is part of the larger whole. In this way it may be beneficial to see the psyche as polytheistic (allowing each archetypal image to exist on its own terms), as James Hillman prefers, and as a monotheistic unity (with a focus on the self as the whole psyche or the organising process within it), as Jung would have it. For the polytheistic approach, the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tradition can be approached and engaged via their traditional correspondences and symbols. Whether it is Mercury/ Hod , Venus/ Netzach , Mars/ Geburah or Saturn/ Binah , the sefirot represent archetypal and mythological patterns (though primarily Occidental in nature) and symbols th at have been present in the human psyche for millennia as has been reflected in re ligion, art and psychology. And as Jung has indicated, contact with the archetypal sources of myth “means an intensification and enhancement of life.” 16 It would be unfortunate if the vitality or value of these sefirot were viewed as inferior to an overarching uni ty within the psyche; however, that unity also brings with it importan t and necessary assumptions. We noted in Chapter Four that David Tacey observed that there seems to be a fear of unity, wholeness or ba lance within our culture. 17 On the one hand, if symbols of wholeness are a necessary and healthy component of our psyche it does us no good to   16 Jung, Letters , vol. 2, 19. 17 David Tacey, “Twisting and Turning with James Hillman” in Ann Casement, ed.

On the ot her hand, the complexity and multiplicity of existence can be eradicated through the zeal ous drive for unity. Unity and difference, balance and disparity, order and chaos are all essential components of the Tree of Life and of our psyches. Crowley’s Liber AL vel Legis reflects this when the goddess Nuit, as “Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof”, 18 speaks the words “For I am divided for love’s sake for th e chance of union.” 19 In other words, we cannot have unity, or by extension wholeness, without division. Pe rhaps it is better to view our psychic cosmology as simultaneously populated with va rious powers or quali ties of equal value with the quality of unity and balance being one of many patterns contained within it but one that is vital for the proce ss of initiation a nd individuation. The “polytheistic” approach to the psyche also encourages investigation into the connections between various archetypal images. In Chapter Four we discussed the relation between Gebura and Hesed . 20 Each sefira represents a unique type of power or quality. The symbols of Mars and Jupiter, wa rrior king and enlightened dictator, play off one another and while it is useful to know the correspondences of each sefira , the nuances of each come out in its comparison w ith the other. For example, this can be applied to the relation between anima and animus. Rather than simply assuming they are separate and gender specific constructs, we can bring them into dialogue with each other. What is it that Hod and Netzach have to offer each other in comparison and contrast? Is it viable or even reasonable that emotional and intellectual capacities be segregated from one another or emphasised in one biological sex over the other? Other questions might involve how the self or the central sefira Tiferet relates to the transpersonal Supernal   18 Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba , 306. 19 Crowley, Magick/Liber Aba , 306. 20 Page 213ff."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 293 Triad or the enigmatic Da’at ? While we will not attempt to engage with these questions presently, we can observe that such obvious qu estions surface as one begins to interact with the Tree and its patterns of connec tivity. Underlying, supporting and informing the processes of the sefirot and the Tree of Life is the ne ither/nor logic of the psyche. The sefirot are abstract middoth of an even more abstract source. We would be hard pressed to prove the sefirot exist in some objective way. However, if we concede that experiences with psychic symbols or figures, such as Jung’s experience with Philemon, are meaningful, or at least potentially so, then the symbolic nature of the Tree may prove to be useful. This is especially the case with the various figures encountered on the Paths of the Tree, which we will analyse in greater detail below under the “Application” heading. The metaphorical and symbolic beings of the Esoteric Tree of Life necessitate the cultivation of neither/nor la nguage in order to engage with them and reflect the complexity and nuances of human consciousness. This is useful in two ways. First, the Tree requires the cultivation of psychological faith. By gr anting these metaphorical and psychic symbols an autonomous position in our psychic reality, we are also granting ourselves the capacity to invoke the libidinous boon they hold. However, as the initiate and Jung were aware, it is easy for the ego-complex to misappropriate that mana . Yet despite the risks, the initia te and analysand dare to hol d fast on the path of self- development. The second useful theory that arises from th e neither/nor language of the Tree of Life is related to the psychological fa ith. While analytical psychology is first and foremost a form of clinical depth psychol ogy, it is also, as Schlamm has indicated supports a form of detraditionalised mysticism."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 294 As analytical psychology attempts to uphol d the scientific sta ndards necessary to legitimise its place as a valid form of clinical psychology, it naturally runs the risk of losing its emphasis on experi ence and development of re gions of the human psyche beyond that of the ego-complex. In Kabba listic terms, there is the risk that Hod will take precedence over Netzach . Of course, there is also th e problem of the converse occurring as can be seen in some New Age and Esoteric literature in which Jung is presented and/or misrepresented. While the clinical practitione rs of analytical psychology are not required to, and perhaps do not even care to, view Jung’s model of the psyche and individuation as a form of mysticism, theirs is not the only interpretation of Jung’s writings. Religion and, more specifically, mysticis m was a major interest and concern for Jung and although he claimed to be an em piricist, the foundation of his empirical perspective was one that was affable toward parts of the human ps ychic experience that other empiricists would have left alone. Perhaps it is useful to see two Jungs. There is the Jung who was concerned with the differe ntiation, development and maintenance of the ego-complex and the clinical applications an d practices that aid in that goal. There is also the Jung who immersed himself deep ly into Kabbalah, alchemy, Gnosticism, mystical Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, shamanic and tribal practices, and the I Ching . This is the same Jung who cultivated two personalities, one of which, the dark one, eventually grew in to a “ghostly guru”. 21 It is not difficult to place Jung’s analytical psychology under the Hot Structured heading of Rawlinson’s taxonomy. As the number two personality, that is the “second” Jung’s, writings fit under the aegis of a secular Hot Structured mysticism, the former Jung’s writings fall under scientific empiricism and in this way they both, when taken together, are also symbolic re presentations of Magick as   21 Jung, MDR , 184."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 295 they reflect both science and art. These two f aces of Jung bring together science and art, head and heart, under the will of individuation through the medi um of the unconscious, in other words, through symbol and metaphor. Application The theories elaborated above are areas that can be explored further and while theories are useful to challenge and change pe rspectives, it may be helpful also to present a few pragmatic applications of the Esoteric Tree of Life. Analytical psychology could benefit the most from a thorough study of the metaphors and practices of the Western Esoteric Tradition. The reason for this is that analytical psychology is, by its very nature , open and amiable to the processes and products of the human unconscious. The sym bols of Kabbalah, including the Tree of Life, have obvious resonances with Jung’s un derstanding of the psyche. Analytical psychology’s lack of spiritual dogma allows for foreign gods, as it were, to surface and to be taken in a critical light. 22 The Western Esoteric Tradi tion, on the other hand, tends to be less liberal in the sense that the entities encountered within the Tradition are generally assumed to be literal and objective beings. 23 Should the Esotericist take up a middle ground that incorporates the value and neces sity of the psyche, as have people like   22 This is not to imply that there are no assumptions made within analytical psychology in relation to how the psyche is viewed. There are differences in pers pectives that can be seen, as Andrew Samuels has demonstrated in his Jung and the Post-Jungians , when comparing Classical, Developmental, and Archetypal schools as well as differences in perspective between analysts trained in the Zurich school of thought and those trained in a more North American medical empirical perspective. Analytical psychology accepts that the unconscious produces images and that those images have meaning or value and can be experienced as autonomous from the eg o-complex that experiences them. 23 The Esotericists who have been cited throughout this thesis represent a rather so phisticated perspective. They tend to incorporate both psychological and spiritual perspectives in their particular outlook regarding the Western Esoteric Tradition. However, as is evident in other spiritual traditions, sometimes the perspective held by the elite in the tradition is not al ways identical to the average or lay practitioner."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" 296 Crowley, Fortune, Regardie, Knight, and DuQuette , then a study of an alytical psychology may help to flush out the psychological ri chness that is endemic to the archetypal symbols of the Tradition. The most obvious place where analytical ps ychology can find applications for the Esoteric Tree of Life is in the practice of pathworking. Let us ta ke a moment to place pathworking in an analytical psychological perspective. 24 Pathworking, within the Western Esoteric Tradition, would gene rally occur within the context of a complete course of intelle ctual and ritual training and practice. The intellectual training and study presents the meanings of the symbols employed in the pathworking, while the ritual practice helps to arrange and concretise them. The following summary of a pathworking is from the Ciceros’ addition to Regardie’s A Garden of Pomegranates . 25 The example summarised below spans the whole Middle Pillar though its focus is on the higher Path bridging Tiferet and Kether . In practice, a ritual such as the LBRP or a more advanced banishing ritual such as the Supreme Banishing Ritual of the Pentag ram (SBRP) and/or the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram (BRH) would precede the pathworking. 26 This would symbolically purify the surroundings and allow for the individual to feel secure and safe. The breathing techniques employed in these ri tuals would also facilitate a state of relaxation through the altering of brain and blood chemistry. Once these preliminary rituals are complete the practitioner begins his or he r guided visualisation.

The summary of this Path given by the Ciceros is as follows: “In this pathworking, the student travels from Malkut h to Yesod to Tiphare th, and continues on the Path of Gimel [the Hebrew letter corre sponding to the Path], where he experiences another ‘Dark Night of the Soul.’” 27 First the practitioner mentally formulates their temple of Malkut (this “temple” would have been developed in earlier training). Once in the Malkut temple the practitioner addresses the Archangel of Malkut , Sandalphon. After an exchange of passwords and symbols th e Archangel leads them to Yesod (the Temple for Yesod would also have been previously developed). The practitioner then arrives at the hexagonal Temple of Tiferet which is “draped in yellow and surrounded by six large candle sticks, with a large hexagram engraved in both ceiling and floor.” 28 After reciting the corresponding di vine names, the Archangel Raphael appears. After again displaying the corre sponding password and symbol, Raphael takes the practitioner to the east of the temple: and draws back a portion of the ye llow drapery to reveal a blue archway bearing a white letter Gimel on its keystone. Within the arch is a veil with the tarot image of The High Priestess painted on it. The archangel traces the symbol of Luna in the air before the archway and the veil evaporates. In its place is a door carved out of moonstone. 29 The practitioner then walks th rough the moonstone door and onto the Thirteenth Path. As the practitioner steps onto the Path the Archa ngel speaks: “It is written: ‘It is not from man to man that the great gifts are communicated, for that whic h he can give to another is   27 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 413. 28 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 413. 29 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 413."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 298 that only which a man can spare from himself.

Eventually thirst and exhaustion begin to take hold and the practitioner falls face first into the sand. Th en a camel, “equipped with an ornate saddle of blue and silver leather c overed in moonstones and pearls” 31 offers itself as a mount to carry the practitioner across th e desert. With the sun setting into darkness, the newly acquired mount ushers the practitioner across th e desert following a path that eventually ends at a great chasm. The camel lunges into the depth of the dark chasm abyss and as it does time seems to stand still and the only frame of continued reference for the practitioner is the mount belo w them. Eventually time con tinues and the camel reaches the other side and continues its pace. Above the rider and mount is a night sky illuminated by a bright full moon. As the camel gallops along the desert it gives way to rolling hills and forests. Ahead is a stream of water from which the rider partakes. The rider returns to the mount and continues to walk up the middle of the stream to its source. 32 At the end of the stream is a small temp le created in the Hellenic style though it is carved entirely from moonstone. The rider dismounts and walks up the stairs of the temple. The temple has no lighting save for the light of the full moon which enters through the open ceiling.

As the prac titioner gazes into the water he or she is gripped by a feeling of despair and doubt: Is this it you wonder? All this way for a temple, a moonlit pool and a drawing of a star? Shouldn’ t there be more? Where are the gods and goddesses, the knights and the prophets, the legends and the stories that illustrated the other paths?...The paths that you explored in the middle realms of the Tree never left you with such feelings of spiritual desolation. You are filled with self-doubt about why you are even attempting to scale the Tree of Life. You question all your motives, your accomplishments, and even your most strongly held spiritual beli efs. Never have you felt more empty or more alone. Overcome by sorrow, you bury your face in your hands and tears stream dow n your face, and your body is wracked with sobs. 33 The tears fall into the pool and turn to pearls. The practiti oner continues to cry until they “have exhausted all feelings of sadness and despair.” 34 As a sense of calm returns, the practitioner looks at the bottom of the pool to see that it is covered with pearls. The eastern wall of the temple is now transparent and opens to the stars on the horizon and where there was once a carving of a star there is now a cluste r of real stars; a galaxy slowly spinning. The voice of the m oon, Selene, speaks from the night sky, her face hidden by a veil.

Your love against all the sorrows of the world? The Path of Gimel passes through Daath, the higher arc of Yesod. It is written ‘In Daath the Depths are broken up and the clouds drop down dew.’ “This is the initiation which no mortal being can offer.

And t hough the practitioner is told they may not understand all that was said and revealed to them there is a sense that a spiritual clarity has been reached on some level. The practitioner climbs back on the camel and returns to the temple of Tiferet where he or she leaves the mount and is greeted by the Archangel Raphael. They then descend the Path of Samek to Yesod to return to Malkut and the Archangel Sandalphon. And with a final gestur e the ritual and pathworking is complete. As is obvious from this one example, the practice of pathworking is a detailed form of meditation and visualisation. Of course any claim to spiritual clarity that culminates from this practice is subjective. However, what we can note is that this type of practice gathers and concentrates the teac hings of the Western Esoteric Tradition, especially as they correspond to the correspondences of the sefirot of the Tree of Life, and organises them in a manner in which they can be engaged with on an imaginal and metaphoric level. The symbols that were or iginally two-dimensional representations of psycho-spiritual processes become ritually vivified and charged. From an analytical psychological perspec tive, exercises such as these could be applied to various archetypal images commonly found within the literature of analytical psychology. For example, a pathworking using details from The Grail Legend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz 36 could be further supported by an understanding of Tiferet . In this way the theori es and assumptions of analytical psychology are made   35 Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates , 417. 36 Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz.

Rather than pa ssively waiting for the unconscious to “send” symbols to consciousness, one can bring together the symbo lic language of the unconscious into a “neither/nor” or liminal portion of consciousness created by activities such as the Western Esoteric banishing rituals. However, on the one hand, by uniting the pre-existing symbol system of the Western Esoteric Tradition with the uniquely psychological interpre tation of the Grail myth and arranging this into a pragmatic activ ity such as pathworking, we have a practice which has more imposed structure than active imagination and is therefore, in a sense, less true to the individual’s psyche and unconscious. On the other hand, the pathworking is systematic, thorough and encourages disc iplined and prolonged wo rk with archetypal images and would ultimately relate to the individual. The same exercises could be applied to Jung’s or Edinger’s interpretation of alchemy or even a pathworking based on an analytical psychologi cal interpretation of the Splendor Solis as found in Henderson and Sherwood’s Transformation of the Psyche . 37 By approaching the Western Esoteric Tradition as Jung approached alchemy and G nosticism, we can begin to appreciate the depths to which archetypal images have permeated the teachings, rituals, and myths of the Tradition. While it is not necessary for an analyst or someone who is interested in the academic application of analytical psychology to understand the Tree of Life and the sefirot , it could prove to be a valuable struct ure or mould for pene trating, experiencing and analysing the numinosity and middoth of archetypal images. The above is but one example of how analytical psyc hology could benefit from the Western Esoteric Tradition.   37 Joseph L. Henderson and Dyane N. Sherwood.

Israel Regardie suggested that those who might be inte rested in studying within the Western Esoteric Tradition undergo ther apy of some type before beginning the training; there are two predicta ble and perhaps not mutually exclusive interpretations of this statement. The first interpretation is that Regardie was being facetious by remarking that all Esotericists should have their heads ex amined. The other interpretation is that as an experienced individual within the Tr adition, Regardie was all too aware of the potential pitfalls of its landscape. Regardie may have in fact meant both but it is the latter which is more relevant to us at the moment. Although a colloquial illustra tion of Regardie’s concern for the potential problem of psychological complications, one need only peruse the various public internet forums dedicated to occult or Esoteric topics to find instances of inflation, deflation, projection, narcissism, and a host of other psychological “issues”. 38 As this thesis is not a clinical work we shall not endeavour to offer a form of distance diagnosis for such people. However, for those who are participating within the Western Esoteric Tradition an analytical psychological interpretation of the Es oteric Tree of Life may be of some use. By utilising a recognisable symbol such as the sefirot and the Tree of Life and applying an interpretation informed by the theories of analytical psychology, the Tree of Life can offer alternative readings for common Esoteric experiences. For example, claims of possession could be buttressed with an understanding of archetypal constellation. Transformative communications fr om other worldly entities or sefirotic beings who seem   38 For example see the Occult Forums at www.occultforums.com, which had at the time of writing, in excess of 6,000 members.

Also, an analytical ps ychological interpretation of the Tree of Life emphasises the importance of connection with the world and our means to interact with it, the ego-complex. The sources from within the Wester n Esoteric Tradition do not generally emphasise how the psycho-spiritual experi ences can be applied in our everyday conscious life. Certainly ther e are some hints evident in the literature. Crowley, in nearly all his works, emphasises the development of the Law of Thelema wherein every man and every woman is to be respected as a unique, th ough not necessarily equal, individual. Fortune emphasises the need to reintroduce th e feminine and chthonic into the world as well as indicating that there are responsibilities for the Adept but little actual detail is presented as to how this should be accomplished. 39 Regardless of what hints are strewn about, there remains the possible risk that an individual can become lost in their own metaphorical world without moorings to keep them anchored and grounded. Crowley’s emphasis on the negative nature of ego consciousness or the Esoteric emphasis on spiritual worlds and astral entities could lead one to hide from or avoid the fundamental trials and tribulations of m undane, egoic life—in other words this world could be seen as less important or vital as the astral or metaphorical world. This could mean possible repression or social dissoci ation instead of an acceptance of and engagement with unconscious metaphorical “b eings” and the corresponding transpersonal   39 This is, of course, to be expected from a person who is part of an “occult” Tradition. Fortune does reveal much of her approach to the Western Esoteric Tradition throughout her technical works and her novels.

The ego-complex is not necessarily a fetter of psycho-sp iritual progress any more than it is the sole authority within th e psyche. The development of a middle ground is desirable wherein the demands of the world of the ego-co mplex and the demands of the unconscious can meet and congress. What ca nnot be forgotten though is that there are responsibilities th at accompany any such dialogue. In a lengthy letter to Father Victor White, Jung discusses the psychotherapeutic implications of psychedelic drugs. What is interesting is Jung’s statement on the result of the archetypal experiences opened by such substances: I only know there is no point in wishing to know more of the collective unconscious than one gets through dreams and intuition. The more you know of it, the greater and heavier becomes your moral burden, because the unconscious contents transform themselves into your individual ta sks and duties as soon as they become conscious. Do you want to increase loneliness and misunderstanding? Do you want more and more complications and increasing responsibilities? 40 Though Jung is discussing the psychological comp lications that could occur with drugs, the same concerns could be applied to the psychological fo rays that the Esotericists undertake. The experience of the unconsci ous has the capacity to complicate and displace our lives. Should the unconscious requ ire it, it may be necessary for us to alter and transform ourselves. This also implies we must have the courage to change the way we view ourselves and how we view others . The Esotericists demonstrate a fearless attitude toward delving into the depths of the unknown but are they prepared or equipped to reintegrate those experiences into the worl d of the ego-complex in such a fashion that each world retains value?   40 Jung, Letters , v.2, 172."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" 305 The Esotericists understand th at there are risks to their spiritual pa th but they also feel the rewards are worth the risks. Jung demonstrates the same fortitude. While Jung may have warned against unnecessarily opening the floodgates to the unconscious, his actions did not always reflect th e safest psychological route. For some there is a drive to make that which is occult conscious. In his seminar on Dream Analysis Jung comments: “When we are unconscious of a thing which is co nstellated, we are identified with it, and it moves us or activates us as if we were ma rionettes. We can only escape that effect by making it conscious and objectifying it, pulling it outside of ourselves, taking it out of the unconscious.” 41 Neither Jung nor the Esotericists wa nt human beings to live as puppets of the unconscious. Each has pr esented the world with their ve rsion of the blade that will cut through the fetters of the psyche. Each has their own merits but how many more strings could be cut if they we re to sit together and dialogue? Conclusion This thesis began by defining how the te rm metaphor is employed in analytical and archetypal psychology. In that cont ext, metaphor is equivalent to Jung’s understanding of archetypes as well as re presenting a realm wh ere a neither/nor perspective is pervasive. It is within this realm that we find the sefirot of the Western Esoteric Tradition. The sefirot have been interpreted in different ways through various spiritual traditions. The interpretations analys ed in the present work focused on Judaism, Christianity, Hermeticism, and the West ern Esoteric (Occult) Tradition. Each interpretation of the sefirot and the Tree, while as unique in application as the tradition   41 Jung, Dream Analysis: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1928-1930 by C.G. Jung , William McGuire, ed.

We could also interpret this in a manner such that we see each tradition as havi ng employed various symbols and metaphors in their endeavour to understand wh at Jung called the collective unconscious. We also saw that Jung was deeply interested in the alchemical traditions which, as scholars such as Drob have indicated, was itself heavil y influenced by Kabbalistic concepts. 42 Jung’s interest in Kabbala h can be found throughout the Collected Works though it is most prevalent in his writings on alchemy and, more specifically, the work of Knorr von Rosenroth. Jung focuses on the relationships between the various personifications of the sefirot and in the process we find that the sefirot reflect Jung’s model of the psyche. Jung found that the alchemical notion of th e Conjunction, with its conjoining of opposites best reflected his understanding of ps ychological maturation or individuation. The Western Esoteric Tradition can be seen as a psycho-spiritual tradition that employs Kabbalistic concepts and, as it developed alongside the discipline of psychology, newly developed psychological theo ries. As such, th e Western Esoteric Tradition presents itself as a viable subject for comparison with analytical psychology. With a restructured definition of Magick, being synonymous with the Western Esoteric Tradition, Chapter Three presen ted the Tradition as having a psycho-spiritual orientation that is concerned with the exploration of human consci ousness through the understanding and applications of symbol and metaphor. Chapter Four initiated a dialogue between the the Western Esoteric Tradition a nd analytical psychology through the sefirot of the Tree of Life where the sefirot symbolised the middoth of the archetype of initiation or in Jung’s terms, individuation.   42 Stanford Drob, Kabbalistic Metaphors (New Jersey: Jason Aronson Inc., 2000), 289-343."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" 307 The lower portions of the Tree of Life symbolise the individuation process or the movement towards a becoming a psychologically whole human being as understood by Jung. However, the standard Tree of Life, es pecially as utilised by the Western Esoteric Tradition and presented in Chapter Five, posits that there is more than the “individual” in the process of becoming whol e. The Supernal Abyss imp lies that there is a boundary between dualistic transpersonal and non-dual tran spersonal realms. Related to this notion of mysticism, Leon Schlamm indicates 43 that we can view anal ytical psychology as a form of secular or detraditionalised form of mysticism. In this way both analytical psychology and the Western Es oteric Tradition, as Hot Structured traditions can be compared on contrasted and while they may be different in many ways, they both have similar goals and means to reach those goals. Chapter Six expanded on the source or r oots of the Tree of Life. These Negative Veils of Existence confirm what Jung indicated, that the ultimate source of the psyche is indefinable and unknowable. However, it is the perspective of the Esotericists that some time in the distant future of human evoluti on more of the unknowable may reach the light of consciousness. The final por tion of Chapter Six presented a cursory interpretation of how the sustained study of the metaphors of th e Tree of Life could be nefit both analytical psychology and the Western Es oteric Tradition on the le vels of both theory and application. For the former the Tree can be a tool for active imagination and symbolic and metaphorical development. For the latter, an understanding of analytical psychology offers alternative, and in some ways more holistic, interpretations of common Esoteric experiences.   43 Leon Schlamm, “C.G. Jung’s Visionary Mysticism” in Harvest: International Journal for Jungian Studies , vol. 52, n. 1., 2006."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 308 Essentially, the Esoteric Tree of Life brings together opposites to facilitate tension both symbolically and litera lly. The Tree both presents the psyche as populated by unique and powerful archetypal energies and at the same time presents the centre of the psyche, especially from the pe rspective of initiation or i ndividuation, as residing in the wholeness of the self. The Tree emphasise s the need for unifying both science and spirituality or in the words of Mansfield, head and heart. Yet to do that one cannot lose sight of the necessary and impor tant role the ego plays in the maintenance of a healthy psyche; a point often lost on the Esotericists. Perhaps most importan tly, the Esoteric Tree of Life implies that the process of psycho-spiritual maturation is a long and arduous path filled with vibrant, numinous and even terr ifying metaphoric and symbolic beings that requires careful and methodical exploration. While not everyone may be suited for or desire to undertake the long and arduous jo urney along the psycho-spiritual paths symbolised by Tree of Life, there will always be those who are driv en by the four powers of the Sphinx: To Know, To Dare, To Will, To be Silent. For those who do feel that drive, an analytical psychological interpretatio n of the Western Esoteric Tree of Life is one more map that may help clarify the lands cape and terrain of me taphor and its relation to the collective unconscious and it may facilitate further reflection and discussion in the same way the Tree of Life has always done in whatever tradition it has taken root."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" 309 Bibliography of References Alister, Ian. “Popular Culture: K eeping Ourselves Together”, in Contemporary Jungian Analysis: Post-Jungian Perspectives from the Society of Analytical Psychology, Ian Alister and Christ opher Hauke, eds.

Individual versions of the ritual may vary from practitioner to practitioner. Purpose The LBRP is generally used in the Western Esot eric Tradition as a bani shing ritual that is thought to clear the area of unwanted influences as well as setting a boundary for sacred or liminal space. Psychologically, the ritual can be seen as a preliminary preparation for active imagination work or as a symbolic st ep into the world of symbol and metaphor. Setting The practitioner stands in the centre of th e Temple (which could be anything from a corner of a room to a full hall or a visualis ed structure) behind the altar. Upon the altar are the Four Elemental Weapons: Wand, Cup, Dagger, and Pentacle. The altar symbolises the centre of the universe, the Axis Mundi , while the Elemental Weapons symbolise a balance of Emotion, Intellect, Bo dy, and Will within the practitioner. The practitioner stands amongs t these symbols of balance and wholeness."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" 331 The Ritual The ritual is composed of two distinct sect ions: the Kabbalistic Cross and the Evocation of the Archangels. The former is also us ed independently as a form of prayer or meditation. Along with the physical movements th ere are also various visualisations that accompany them; only the most basic visualisations are recounted here. 1. Kabbalistic Cross The practitioner visualises a scintillating ball of white light above her head. This is a symbol of her divine spark or higher self. Jung’s notion of “the self” would resonate symbolically with this spark. The practitioner reaches above her head and draws the light down to her forehead. This can be accomplis hed by the use of the index finger of the right hand or by the use of a ritual dagger. Touching her forehead the practitioner intones: ATAH (For Thine/Unto Thee). The practitioner thrusts he r hand down her torso, covering the groin region. Th e light is visualised as ru shing down the body to the feet and below. The practitioner then intones: MALKUT (The Kingdom). The practitioner brings the light to the right s houlder, seeing an orb of light fo rming just to th e right of the shoulder. The practitioner intones: ve-G EBURAH (and the Power). The practitioner brings the light across to the left shoulder, visu alising a globe of light just to the left of the shoulder. She intones: ve-GEDULAH (and the Glory). Fi nally, the practitioner claps her hands over her breast and intones: le-OLAHM, AMEN (Unto the Ages, Amen— Amen being an acronym for: God is a faithful king.”)"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" 332 2. Formulation of the Pentagrams The practitioner moves clockwise from behind th e altar to the East of the Temple. The practitioner traces a flaming banishing pentagra m of Earth with either her finger or ritual knife (this is also amplified through visualis ation). She then visualises the God name YHVH (one pronunciation is simply: Yod He Vau He ) in flaming letters in front of her. The practitioner inhales the name into her body and as the name “touches” her feet the practitioner thrusts her hands out in front of her at the same time she loudly intones or vibrates the God name. Following this she pl aces her finger on her lips thus sealing the pentagram. The same process is repeated in the South with the G od name, Adonai; in the West with Eheiyeh and ending in the North with the God name AGLA (which is short for: “Thou art great forever, oh Lord”). Follo wing this the practitioner returns behind the altar. 3. Calling the Archangels. Standing behind the altar, facing East with arms out to the side of the body and feet together (forming and upright cross), the prac titioner visualises an angelic figure with yellow and purple robes (colours of the element of Air) and says: “Before me, Raphael”. She then visualises an angelic figure in bl ue and orange robes (c olours of Water) and says: “Behind me, Gabriel”. To her right the practitioner visualises an angelic figure with red and green robes (colours of Fire) and says: “On my right hand, Michael”. The practitioner then visualises an angelic figure with earth t oned green/brown robes (colours of Earth) and says “On my left hand stands Auriel”. The practitioner moves the left foot"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" 333 out to the side (forming a pentagram with the body) and says: “About me flames the pentagram and in the Column shines the six-rayed star.” Following this the Kabbalistic Cross is repeated. The ritual is then complete and any further work (more banishing rituals, prayer, meditation, practical magic, etc.) can begin. Essentially, the practitioner is symbo lically standing in the centre of a mandala that is sealed with various names of God and reinforc ed, as it were, with a quaternity of angelic beings. If taken symbolically and metaphoric ally, this ritu al can have obvious parallels with Jungian thought."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" 334 Appendix B: The Middle Pillar Ritual The following narrative description of the MPR is compiled from various sources and reflects a general version of the ritu al. Individual versions of the ritual may vary from practitioner to practitioner. The most thorough source regarding this ri tual is Regardie’s The Middle Pillar . Purpose The Middle Pillar ritual is thought to charge various ener gy centres of the body (similar to the notion of chakras ) that correspond to the sefirot of the Tree of Life. The ritual also moves and directs energy. The MPR also has me ditative applications that can be found in Regardie’s The Middle Pillar . Setting The practitioner stands in the centre of th e Temple (which could be anything from a corner of a room to a full hall or a visualis ed structure) behind the altar. Upon the altar are the Four Elemental Weapons: Wand, Cup, Dagger, and Pentacle. The altar symbolises the centre of the universe, the Axis Mundi , while the Elemental Weapons symbolise a balance of Emotion, Intellect, Bo dy, and Will within the practitioner. The practitioner stands amongs t these symbols of balance and wholeness."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 335 The Ritual The ritual is composed of two distinct sect ions: the intonation of the Divine names and the Circulation of the Body of Light. The former is the MPR proper and is used independently as a form of prayer or me ditation. Along with the physical movements there are also various visualisations th at accompany them; only the most basic visualisations are recounted here. 1. Vibration of the Divine Names The practitioner stands or lies with hands to her side and visualises a scintillating ball of white light above her head. This is a symbol of her divine spark or higher self. Jung’s notion of “the self” would reso nate well with this spark. Wh ile focusing on this light the practitioner intones or vibrates the God name Eheieh three or four times. She then visualises the light descending to the neck re gion and intones YHVH Elohim . The visualisation then focuses on the solar plexus where the practitioner vibrates YHVH Eloah va-Daath . Once this is complete the focus turn s to the genital regi on and the God name Shaddai El Chai . Finally, the visualisation moves to the feet where the final God name, Adonai ha-Aretz is intoned. A more advanced version of the ritual also includes the corresponding colours: white, lavender, yellow/ gold, violet and black respectively. In essence the practitioner is drawing down divine energy into various areas or sefirot of a microcosmic Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 336 2. Circulation of the Body of Light The circulation of the Body of Light is not technically part of the Middle Pillar Ritual but it is common to find the two exercises linked together. Once the MPR is complete the practitioner refocuses on the firs t ball of light. She then exhales and “pushes” the light in an arch to the left and down to her feet. She then inhales and “pulls” the energy up her right side in an arch to the head. This is repeated several times. The same is repeated again but this time moving from the front of the body (exhale) to the feet then from the feet up the back of the body (inha le) to return to the head. Finally, focus is moved to the feet. Energy is visualised as spiralling or wrapping itself up the body (inhale) and is exploded, visualised like a fireworks explos ion, out the top of the head (exhale) and allowed to settle at the feet again. In this way the energy centres that were activated or charged in the MPR are mobilised or utilised in the Circulation of the Body of Light. In essence, the practitioner has symbolically linked herself with the balanced state of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life at th e same time they charge the corresponding sefirot on a microcosmic level."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" 337 Glossary of Non-Jungian Terms The following definitions were compiled primarily from the following sources (some definitions were altered for brevity or relevance): Alan Axelrod, The International Encyclopedia of S ecret Societies & Fraternal Orders , (New York, NY: Facts On File, Inc., 1997). Dan Cohn-Sherbok, The Blackwell Dic tionary of Judaica , (Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers, 1992). Nevill Drury, The Dictionary of Mysticism and the Occult , (New York, NY: Harper & Row, 1985).

The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion , (Boston, MASS: Shambhala Publications, Inc., 1994). Abramelin Operation - Ritual which, in its classic form , requires six mont hs of increasing prayer and meditation. The culmination of the ritual has the practitioner contact their holy Guardian Angel and cause the fallen ange ls (which can be understood to symbolise one’s shadow or a transpersonal shadow) to become subservient to the practitioner. Abyss (Supernal Abyss, Great Abyss) - Boundary between the ideal world (symbolised by the first three sefirot ) and the actual world (symbolised by the remaining sefirot ). The Abyss can also be seen as the boundary be tween rational and tran s-rational thought and the separation of personal and transp ersonal psychological experience. Adam Kadmon - Anthropomorphic representation of the Tree of Life.
