[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter One We have already explained at length in a special pamphlet , 1 concerning the particula r manners in which one may be aroused in his mind and heart, and the thought which is born of contemplation ( hitbonenut ), according to the five levels of the soul NaRaN”ChaY 2 . We must now clearly explain the matter of contemplation itself, to understand w hat it essen tially is, and what one should contemplate. 3 In essence, contemplation ( hitbonenut ) is the matter of gazing strongly into the depths of a concept , keeping one ’ s mind upon it for long periods, until he understands it thoroughly in all of its pa rticular parts and details. This is the inner aspect of the faculty of Binah (Understanding) . In the terminology of the Talmud it is called by the term “ Iyun ” – עיון , ( in depth study ). This is as stated in tractate Sukka 4 , “There is Girsa – גירסא (surface study), and there is Iyun – עיון (in depth study ) ” . The explanation of surface study is that one understand s the subject matter only at first glance. That is, he flows quickly through the subject matter which he studies, without restraining himself and pausing at all, as is known 5 . For example , one may gaze upon a certain object without contemplating it at all, to understand the nature of how or what it is. He does not investigate all of its inner and oute r parts, except in a passing fashion . Certain ly, with the passage of time, he will forget about it altogether . Furthermore, he will only be able to relate the general matter 6 of what he saw to his fellowman. This is because his eyes on ly fell upon it in a passing fashion , without keeping his eyes upon it at all.   1 Referring to Kuntrus Ha’hitpa’alut – a tract on ecstasy, also authored by Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch. 2 This is an acronym for Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chay ah and Yechidah. These are (in ascending order) the five general levels of the human soul. In Kuntrus Ha’hitpa’alut , the Rebbe explains at length how through contemplation a person is capable of arousing and revealing the higher levels of his soul. Ther e, he explains the various resulting levels of arousal according to each level of both the animal and the Divine souls. 3 This book comes as a direct continuation of Kuntrus Ha’hitpa’alut . That is, in Kuntrus Ha’hitpa’alut the Rebbe explained that it is specifically through contemplation that one can arouse any emotions towards the Creator. Here though, the Rebbe informs the reader in regard to the methodology of contemplation itself, and the subject matter upon which one must contemplate in order to ach ieve the result of inspiration towards G -d. The first nine chapters of this book explain the methodology of contemplation itself, while chapters ten through fifty four explain the subject matter upon which one is to contemplate. 4 See tractate Sukka 28b. 5 This is a valid method of general study, generally used in Talmud study in order to gain a breadth of the knowledge of the Talmud, as opposed to a depth. 6 He will only be capable of explaining what he saw in the most general of terms, but he will be co mpletely incapable of explaining its details."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This is l ikewise the case when the mind ’s eye gazes upon a specific logic al construct in just a passing fashion . Because he understands the conce pt only at first glance without pausing and restraining himself to analyze and investigate it properly , he will not come to know the concept to its ultimate depth at all. Now, t here are three matters in ever y intellectual concept. These are; depth, lengt h and width. T he width is the explanation of the concept from all angles, with many particulars. This is analogous to the width of a wide river. In contrast, t he understanding of a concept simply , as it is 7 , is similar to a narrow river. The length of a concept is the tremendous descent of the concept, to invest it in to various different analogies so that it may even be brought within the reach of a small child. This is analogous to a flowing river which draws out to its length. 8 (This concept is expl ained at length in Chassidic manuscripts 9 in regard to the matter of the length of the hides. 10 ) The depth of a concept is analogous to the depth of a river. From its depth the river widens , but in and of itself it is not wide at all. However , it is the main essence of the river (which is called the “undercurrent”), fo r it is the main strength of its flow from its source. The waters which are above the depth, to its height or its sides and even its length, are secondary to the depth, for they only represe nt the spreading forth of its strength. 11 Likewise, the depth of the intellectual concept is the as pect of its essential point, as it is in and of itself. 12 This is what is called “The depth of that which is comprehended ” ( omek ha’moo sag ). Everything that spreads forth in the explanation of this concept, either the great width with many angles and details, and also the great descent of the length, and even the height above, to understand higher concepts through this concept 13 , are all drawn from the essenti al depth of the point of   7 In other words, “How it is” at first glance, it is only understood from a single angle, and even then not to its very depth. It is therefore “narrow”. This is like one who is “narrow - minded” and can only se e things in one way, and not from any other angle. 8 A river begins high up in the mountain peaks and is drawn out with great length until it reaches sea level. Likewise, the concept begins as a lofty or deep concept, in that it is removed from the unders tanding. Through the use of analogies, one brings the concept down from its loftiness and brings it close to his mind, so that it may easily be grasped. 9 See Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe), Pekudei & Noach. 10 This refers to the length of the hides u sed to cover the tabernacle. In general, it is explained there that the length of a concept refers to the fact that it undergoes many changes along its descent, yet remains essentially the same. An example of this is how the automobile has undergone many drastic changes from the first automobile until the automobile of today. Nonetheless, they are still essentially the same thing. Likewise, when a teacher takes the way he understands a concept and lowers it down to the comprehension of a child, although it has undergone various changes and descents, it is still essentially the very same concept which is conveyed. 11 The strength of the depth of the river is its undercurrent, the source of which is the strength of the flow of waters from the spring. Accor ding to the strength of this flow (i.e. its depth), will be the measure of its length, width, (and height). A river with a weak depth will be very shallow, narrow, and have a short length. In contrast, a river with a strong depth will be very deep, wide and have a great length. 12 How it is in and of itself, before it is limited and defined through the spreading forth of a length and width etc. 13 Footnote of the Rebbe: (Through the aspect of “height” one’s understanding may reach) all the way until the dep th of the heights, like the overpowering of the waters in the time of the flood (during the times of Noah). Likewise, there will be a spiritual flood (which refers to the spreading forth of the teachings of Chassidus) in the days of Moshiach, in the 600 th year of the life of Noah (5600 th year of the Jewish calendar which refers to 1840 of the common era). This is as stated in the Zohar that “the wellsprings of wisdom"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the concept 14 , which is how it spreads forth from Chochmah – Wisd om, which is called “ ein 15 - nothing” . This i s as stated, “A river goes out from Eden ”. Binah (understanding) is called a river, while Chochmah (insight ) is called a spring , as is known 16 . This , then , is the mode of study called Iyun (in depth study); that he keeps his mind on the concept 17 and analyzes it greatly. This is a slow in depth study which is the opposite of the quick surface level of study. The purpose of this is specifically to rea ch the depth of the concept, as it is in its innermost essential point. This is analogous to one who gazes his eyes upon a certain object, but not in a passing manner . Rather, he keeps his eyes upon it with great attention and scrutiny , taking his time until he knows it well, in all of its internal and innermost components . This type of study is called Hitbonenut – contemplation. The word Hitbonenut ( התבוננות ) is specifically spelled with two Nuns ( נ – N) 18 , to signify that one is to       will open”. These are the springs of the depths of wisdom, “which will overpower and ris e up and will cover all the mountains”. Then, “the reservoirs of the heavens shall open up”, and there shall be drawn down “the waters which are above the heavens”. This is called the depth of the height, which is dependant upon the depth below, because “the beginning is bound up with the end”, as in the verse, “Cast your questions to the depths or raise it on high” etc. 14 One who grasps the depth of the concept itself is certainly capable of explaining it from many angles (and even bringing forth new ang les). He is likewise capable of bringing the concept down in length to the understanding of one who is of lesser intellectual capacities than himself. An example for this can be taken from the study of mathematics. Once a person has grasped the very dep th and core of the concept of addition, he is now capable of adding any two numbers together, infinitely. This is true even though in school he was not given these particular two numbers to add together. Likewise, he is capable of explaining addition to someone else, and bringing the concept into allegories such as “one apple plus one apple equals two apples” etc. In contrast, one who has not grasped the depth will not possess this length and width. Rather, he will only be capable of regurgitating what he received in explanation, without a full understanding of its depth at all. We therefore observe that the width and length of the concept are dependant upon its depth. Another concept of “height” has also now been introduced. This means that once one has understood the depths of a concept, this concept may now be used as a building block to reach deeper depths, or “heights”. In the example given above, through first understanding the depth of arithmetic, one may then move on to “higher” mathematical concepts, such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus etc. Eventually he can reach great depths in mathematics, which would not have been possible had he not first grasped the depth of addition. One who cannot add can certainly not explain numbers theory. This is the explanation of the “height” of a concept. 15 See Tikkunei Zohar רתמ \" ב , and Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’I, Bereshit p.2 16 The river refers to the logical comprehension and grasp of a concept of Binah , whereas Chochmah is compared to a spring, from where there bubble forth flashes of insight and intuitive wisdom in the subject matter of one’s study. This verse states, “A river came forth from Eden ”. The word Eden means “pleasure”. It will be explained in chapter 26 that pleasure is associated with Chochmah . The main reason for this is that the seminal f lash of intuition which spreads forth into the river of comprehension of Binah is where the pleasure of understanding is located. Likewise, Chochmah is compared to water, while Binah is compared to fire. This is because it is the nature of water to desce nd, while it is the nature of fire to ascend. Likewise, it is the desire of Chochmah to descend into graspable comprehension, while it is the desire of Binah to ascend, with an upward yearning, to understand that which is not yet understood. This is appl icable in this explanation here, for the foundation of water is the source of all pleasure, i.e. Eden . (See Tanya Ch. 1) 17 In other words, one must study the known explanations and body of knowledge in such a manner in order to reach the depths of it. Onc e he has done this study and has reached the very essential depths, he may be capable of bringing out new explanations and insights, which were never previously explained. 18 It would have been just as proper for the word Hitbonenut ( התבוננות ) to be spelle d with only one Nun , i.e. Hitbonut ( התבונות ). The extra Nun signifies and emphasizes that one is to contemplate the material greatly, going over it many times in a way of contemplation, in order to understand its depth."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"contemplate it and analyze it greatly. This is in accordance with the explanation of Rashi 19 on the word Iyun 20 , “To stand upon the subject, to understand it clearly”. We find that this aspect of Iyun 21 is only an aspect of a receptacle for the delving of Binah 22 itself. For, at first glance, this aspect of Iyun is called “the delving of the concentration” 23 in common usage . In truth , this is not the case, for the delving of the concentration is only a vessel, which allows one to come to the actual depth of the concept. 24 A higher level tha n the level of the “delving of the concentration” ( Ha’amakat Ha’da’at ), is what is called “delving” ( Ma’amik ). This method of delving all ows one to reach higher than even Chochmah itself. 25 Now, seemingly, Chochmah is literally an aspect of the intangible “nothingness” of the concept, as it exists even before it comes into the category of being the essential depth or point of the concept in the comprehension of Binah 26 . As mentioned previously, it is like the waters of a spring in comparison to the waters of a river. Nonetheless, the aspect of delving in this source of the concept 27 , its source reaches into the very source of the flow of the waters of the spring, 28 which is called “the depths of   19 Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, one of th e foremost and most authoritative commentators on the Tanach and the Talmud. 20 See Rashi on tractate Sukka, 28b. 21 This refers to the keeping of one’s mind upon a subject matter. 22 This refers to the actual logical investigation into the particulars of the subject matter, which is “the inner aspect of Binah ”, as mentioned previously. 23 In the original Hebrew it is Ha’amakat Ha’da’at , which literally means “the delving of the knowledge”. Later on in this chapter, the Rebbe will explain that the faculty of D a’at is the faculty of concentration. 24 In other words, at first glance it would appear that what we have been describing is a faculty of Da’at , which is the faculty of concentration. It could be erroneously understood that through concentration alone one can arrive at the depth of the subject matter. Here, the Rebbe corrects an error which is prevalent amongst most methods of meditation. Many methods of meditation instruct one to activate his concentration on a single focal point or thought, while block ing out all other thoughts and shutting off the analytical and logical brain of Binah . They believe that through this one may attain a glimpse into the truth of reality. In contrast, what is explained here is that concentration alone is only a vessel for the analytical mind of Binah . That is to say, one who is incapable of concentrating on the subject matter will certainly be incapable of scrutinizing all its details. Nonetheless, concentration alone would be an empty vessel, and therefore not lead one to any truths. Therefore, although concentration is a necessary prerequisite, nonetheless, the main focus is on the analytical and logical investigation and study of the subject matter. This is more simply understood by the fact that if one meditates on the word “medicine”, even for ten years, he will still not be come a doctor. Furthermore, if this person thinks that he possesses any knowledge of medicine solely through this, we can be sure that he is delusional. Although he has concentrated very strong ly, he was lacking the subject matter upon which he should have been concentrating. His “vessel” of “knowledge” ( Da’at ) is therefore still empty. 25 One is only capable of this level called Ma’amik – Delving, once he has already learned the entire known body of knowledge (of this subject matter), and grasped its depth. In this level a person delves into the depth itself, to understand deeper and deeper depths, and bring out new insights. In contrast, in the first level of Ha’amakat Ha’da’at – the delving of the concentration, the person has not yet received any explanations at all. Through concentrating he becomes a fitting receptacle to receiving the explanations. 26 That is, it is like the waters of the spring of insight ( Chochmah ), before they have burs t through the ground to become the depth of the river of the comprehensive grasp of Binah . 27 The source of the concept referred to here is Chochmah . This is like the concealed waters of the spring which are the source of the waters of the river. 28 That is , the spring also has a source, which is the aquifer. Furthermore, there are different depths within the spring itself, some levels being closer to “ground level”, while others are closer to the ultimate depth of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Chochmah ” or “the hidden -ness of Chochmah ” 29 . For, just as there are depth, length and width in Binah which is called “ yesh 30 – something”, there is likewise a depth, length and width in the spring of Chochmah , which is called “ ein – nothing”. The depth of the spring is the beginning and source of its inception, at its very depth. From there its flow spreads upward until drops of water burst forth into revelation from their concealment with in the groun d. Its utmost concealment is in its ultimate depth below (in the aquifer), as in the verse, “the wellsprings of the abyss burst forth”. For, the earth is riddled with fissures 31 and veins of wat er, which have a primary depth 32 . About this it is stated 33 , “ Chochmah is found from nothing”, i.e. from the concealed depths of Chochmah . Now, Chochmah is the discovery of new insight which emerges like a bolt of lightning, as is known. The source of its inception in its hidden depths is its innermost essence. Th is is similar to the previous explanation of the matter of the depth of the comprehended concept ( omek ha’moo sag ) of Binah . However, that was only in regard to the depth of the comprehension of Binah which is felt in a tangible way, with revealed explanat ion s on a subject . The depth of this explanation of the concept 34 is only the aspect of the “ nothing of the something” of comprehension. Therefore, its depth, which is its essential point, is of no comparison to the “nothing” of Chochmah before it comes i nto the category of comprehension altogether 35 . Nevertheless , although the depth of the comprehension, which is called the 50 th gate of Binah , is drawn from the “nothing” of Chochmah to “something” 36 , its source also reaches into the depths of Chochmah itse lf. It is clearly observable that the delving specifically into the depth of the comprehension ( omek hamoo sag of Binah ) will bring one to the source and root of the concept, thus enabling him to bring new light of Chochmah (insight) into Binah       “the aquifer”. Likewise, in Chochmah itse lf, one is capable of delving into the depths, and is capable of even reaching the very source of Chochmah . 29 In the Hebrew it is Omkei Chochmah or Ta’alumot Chochmah . See also Job 11:6 30 This can also be understood as “the tangible”. Whereas, “ Ein – not hing”, can be understood as “the intangible”, as will now be explained. 31 Talmud Bavli, tractate Chagiga 22a 32 This refers to the aquifer. 33 Job 28:12 34 This refers to the tangible explanation of the concept in the comprehension of Binah . Its depth is cal led the omek ha’moo sag , which is the essential point of the concept, as it “flashes” or flows from the spring of Chochmah . 35 We now understand the progression of the concept from completely intangible to completely tangible. The concept begins in the “not hing of the nothing”, in the depths and source of Chochmah itself. There it is completely nondescript and intangible. From there it spreads forth to become the “something of the nothing”, where although it is still intangible, it takes on a certain form and tangibility. From there it spreads forth to “burst out of the spring”, and becomes the “nothing of the something”, the intangible source of the revealed and tangible concept. Here it already has a certain definite form, as pertaining to a certain fie ld of study or a particular explanation etc. From this depth of the comprehension, i.e. the “nothing of the something”, all the tangible explanations spread forth with a length and width. The length and width of the tangible explanations themselves is th e “something of the something”. 36 Footnote of the Rebbe: This is like, “A s pring will flow out of the chamber of the Holy of Holies; its beginning will be like the antennae of a grasshopper, and it will then widen into the expanse of a river”. See tractat e Yoma 77b. [This gives insight as to how the flash of Chochmah begins as a seminal point, and becomes developed into a full blown “river” in the comprehension of Binah .]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(tangible c omprehension). This , then , is what is called ma’amik – delving, which is an active verb, for he is activating the depths of Chochmah and Binah 37 . (According to what we have explained, we may understand the statement 38 , “ Understand with wisdom and be wise i n understanding”. I n Chassidic manuscripts it is explained that “wise in understanding” refers to A”b of Sa”G 39 ( Chochmah of Binah ). This is the ability to understand a new insight within the comprehension of Binah 40 . This only comes through the aspect of Iyun – the analysis mentioned earlier, which clarifies all of the particular parts until they are clear. This Iyun (analysis) is what is called Binah of Binah . After a person has done this he is capable of bringing new insight into understanding and com prehension, but only within the subject matter itself. This insight is what is called Chochmah of Binah . Now, Keter of Binah is the aforementioned depth of the comprehension (the omek hamoo sag ) whose source reaches into the depth of Chochmah , as explaine d above. Now, “understand with wisdom” refers to Sa”G of A”b ( Binah of Chochmah ). This is the power of explanation with in Chochmah itself, that he is capable of bringing it in to many different explanations and facets 41 . Nonetheless, it is still higher th an the comprehension of Binah . Th is type of understanding may be understood from the explanation of the statement 42 regarding Moshe, “He could not find ‘m en of understanding ’ ( Nevonim )”. 43 This ( Navon ) specifically refers to “one who understands one thing from another” . 44 The reason he is capable of this is because of the source of this power of “understand with wisdom” ( Binah of Chochmah ) which reaches into the depths of Chochmah , which was mentioned   37 We may once again clearly note the difference between the “delving of the concentr ation” mentioned earlier, and this aspect of “delving”. See footnotes 24 & 25. 38 See Sefer Yetzirah 1:4 39 The four letters of the Tetragrammaton ( Havayah ) correspond to the ten sefirot . The thorn of the letter Yud ( י ) corresponds to Keter . The body of the letter Yud ( י ) corresponds to Chochmah . The first letter Heh ( ה ) corresponds to how the seminal point of the Yud of Chochmah becomes expanded into the length and width of the Heh of Binah . The Vav ( ו ) which has a numerical value of six corresponds to the six emotional sefirot . The last Heh ( ה ) corresponds to Malchut . This will all be explained later in greater detail. What is relevant here is that the four letter name can be expanded. In other words, instead o f Y ( י ) the letter Yud would be spelled out as יוד . The same is done with the other three letters of the name. Now, when it is spelled out with Yud’s (i.e. יו \" ד ה \" י וי \" ו ה \" י ) it has a numerical value of 72 and corresponds to Chochmah , which is the name A ”b – ע \" ב (meaning 72). When it is spelled out with Yud’s and an Aleph ( יו \" ד ה \" י וא \" ו ה \" י ) its numerical value is 63 and corresponds to Binah . This is the name Sa”G – ס \" ג , which equals 63. We may now understand the above statement that, “be wise in unders tanding” refers to A”b of Sa”G . In other words, it refers to the sefirah ; Chochmah of Binah . Likewise, the aspect of Sa”G of A”b corresponds to Binah of Chochmah . The Rebbe will now explain this further. (The details of the expansions and names will be discussed later in the book.) 40 In other words, he only has insight into the specific subject matter which he studies. 41 Since Chochmah is the source of all wisdoms, and not just a particular field of study, the power of Binah within Chochmah is the abili ty to explain all wisdoms and their essential relationship with each other. In contrast, the power of Binah of Binah is the capability to explain only a particular wisdom. This will be understood as the Rebbe continues. 42 See tractate Eruvin 100b 43 The word used is Navon – A man of understanding. It is explained (Tractate Chagigah 14a) that this refers to one who understands one thing from another. In other words, it refers to one who can understand and have insight into one field of study, from anothe r field of study. This is because he has grasped the essence of both these wisdoms in Chochmah wh er e th e two fields ar e essen tially un ified. 44 See tractate Chagigah 14a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"previously 45 . For this reason, from one subject matter a nd wisdom he is capable of understanding a completely different wisdom 46 . This aspect of understanding is much greater in level than that of a Chacham 47 . That is, a Chacham only has insights from “nothing” into the particular subject matter of his investig ation, but he does not understand an entirely different wisdom from it. (Nonetheless, the source of the comprehension of a new insight within the field of his comprehension is also the matter of “understand with wisdom” ( Binah of Chochmah ). 48 In other wor ds, its source is in the ability to understand one thing from another. However , this remains concealed in the source of the intellect. This will suffice those of understanding.) We find tha t the order of levels is as follows ; first is the aspect of Iyun – analysis, mentioned earlier. That is, to keep one ’ s mind on the concept, and investigate its particulars, until it is completely clear. This is called Binah of Binah ; to clarify and distinguish between all the inner and outer specifics , with the utmos t precision. From this, it is also possible for there to be the aspect of a length, to lower the concept through many invest ments 49 , until it is made tangible to the comprehension of a child, as explained previously. Nonetheless, he does not yet have the aspect of a width , with various explanations of all its angles. Following this is the aspect of Chochmah of Binah , which is the ability to br ing forth insights, but only in the specific subject under his investigation, as previously explained. This is th e aspect of the width, from which the aspect of Binah of Binah creates a length 50 . Nonetheless, the extent of the length and width of Chochmah and Binah is dependant upon the aspect of the depth of the comprehension, which is called Keter of Binah . It is clearly observable with any comprehension of any subject matter that according to the measure of the depth will be the measures of the length and width 51 . This will suffice those of understanding.)   45 In other words, this power reaches into the essential depth and source of all wisdom s, which is their essential unifying truth. 46 Aside from the simple meaning of the above, this also has a deeper meaning. That is, one who truly possesses this power is capable of perceiving G -dliness (one thing), from within the physical (another thing). This indeed is the true purpose of Hitbonenut . 47 A Chacham is on the level of “be wise in understanding”, whereas a Navon is on the level of “understand with wisdom”. Therefore, a Chacham is only capable of bringing insights into the particular subject matter of his study, whereas a Navon is capable of understanding an entirely different wisdom from the subject matter of his study. 48 In other words, the source of the power of the particular insight of Chochmah of Binah is also in Binah of Chochmah . The only difference is that in relation to a Chacham , the Binah of Chochmah remains concealed, while for a Navon it is revealed. 49 Investments refers to analogies. 50 Although we previously said that he is capable of having a length even before there is a width , it is actually from this aspect of Chochmah of Binah that there can be a whole new length. In other words, at first he only understands the subject from a single particular angle, and can explain a length of explanation according to this angle. When he has a flash of insight into the subject matter, and understands a whole new angle, he is now capable of explaining the very same concept from a whole new angle. That is, there are now two lengths drawn from the same depth. This creates the dimension of width. The more lengths of explanation that there are, i.e. more angles, the more of a width there is. These are both dependant upon the depth, as was previously explained. 51 For example, a subject matter with a shallow depth, such as tic -tac -toe, will h ave a very short length, and not much of a width. There is a maximum of only one or two ways to explain it. In contrast, a deeper knowledge, such as medicine or mathematics, will have a great length of explanation (8 -10 years of study)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" According to what w e have explained, what is commonly cal led ha’amakat ha’da’at – the delving of the concentration (or meditation), is not the actual delving into the depth of the comprehension (the omek hamoo sag ) 52 . This is because the faculty of Da’at has no relation to it. Rather, the faculty of Da’at is the aspect of the strong connection of one ’ s feelings to a concept 53 . It is this type of concentration which brings one to the depth of the comprehended concept, but only after the aforementioned analysis ( Iyun ), which act s as a receptacle for the depth of th e comprehension 54 ( omek hamoo sag ), as previously explained. Now, Da’at – concentration, also possesses the three dimensions of length, width and depth. For example, there are those who have a short attention span, and those who have a long attention span. There are those who have a broad attention span, but not a long attention span 55 . There are those who possess strong concentration, and those of weak concentration, like “ women 56 who have a light Da’at ” 57 . That is, because they lack the depth of concentra tion, subsequently their concentration is short. The difference between a weak concentration and a deep concentration can be understood by the difference between a child and an adult , as is known. A child has a weak concentration. This is to say that he only possess es a very external connection or feelings to wards the object of his understanding or desire . For this reason, a child can be easily seduced into desiring the very opposite of his original desire. In contrast, an adult has a deep connection t o the object of his understanding and desire, which is called the depth of concentration (or interest) . Because he possesses this depth, this automatically draws out a length of concentrati on and a width of concentration, as we previously explained regard ing Binah 58 . The sign for this deep concentration is that because of the great depth of his connection to the intellectual concept 59 it appears as if he is contracting and focus ing the vessel of his brain 60 . It is       and many different facets and fields within it. An even deeper knowledge such as the Torah, which has an infinite depth, also has an infinite length and width. 52 In other words, concentration alone has no connection to the flash of insight or the depth of the concept, and it alone will not bring one to any insight. It is necessary to fill this vessel of concentration with the aspect of Iyun in order for any depth or insight to be reached. 53 Concentration and interest 54 What we have here is a sequence of receptacles. The first v essel which one must fashion in order to have insight into any subject matter is the aspect of concentration and interest. Now, this vessel is the receptacle for another type of vessel or tool, which is the actual analysis. If one has the concentr ation alone, he has an empty vessel, which will not lead him to insight. The analysis is the vessel and tool which leads one to the depth of the concept or subject matter. Only by having both of these two vessels (concentration and analysis) is insight p ossible. 55 In other words, they are capable of holding their concentration over a multitude of particulars and points, but only for a short period of time. This is an example of a wide but short concentration. In contrast, a long but wide concentration w ould be the ability to concentrate for a long period of time. Nonetheless, as soon as there are a few too many particular details, the concentration is broken and he becomes confused. 56 The Rebbe is not making a derogatory statement in regard to women, bu t is only pointing out a certain nature. While men have a stronger faculty of Da’at – concentration, women have an additional portion of Binah . They, therefore, have a greater capacity to notice many details, which a man may overlook. 57 See Tractate Shabbat 33b 58 It was previously explained that the measure of length and width is according to the depth. 59 That is, because of the great depth of his connection to the intellectual concept, to the exclusion of everything else . 60 For example , because of his deep concentration and mental investment in the concept, his face can appear to be contorted, like the wrinkling of the brows etc."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"specifically through this deep concentratio n that he can come to an essential and deep comprehension of the subject matter, through the aforementioned analysis of Bina h 61 . The aspect of analysis though, is the very opposite of contraction and focus (of all his mental capacities). Although , initial ly, the analysis of Binah begins with a focus and contraction, it nonetheless immediately spreads forth with great expansiveness , with the clarifica tion of all the particular components and details, as is known. This is not the case with the contraction and focus of the delving of the concentration. On the contrary, the concentration is only the contraction and f ocus, the aspect of gathering all of ones mental capacities to connect only to this specific matter. This is the very opposite of the spreading forth of the analysis with a great breadth into the subject matter. However, it is through the delving of the concentration that one can come to the depth of the intellectual concept, until its very source in the depths of Chochmah and Binah 62 . (Through t he above he is capable of reaching the aspect of the upper Da’at 63 which unites Chochmah and Binah 64 , as was explained previously regarding the matter of the depth of the comprehension ( omek hamoo sag ) of Binah 65 . This is the meaning of the statement 66 , “ Da’at is hidden in the mouth of Imma 67 ”. 68 It is likewise stated, “ Moshe , who corresponds to the faculty of Da’at merited Binah ” 69 , whi ch refers specifically to the fiftieth gate of Binah . These two faculties are interdependent 70 , as is explained in various writi ngs and Chassidic manuscripts. This will suffice those of understanding.) End of Chapter One   61 One who studies in only a superficial way, without a true and deep interest and concentration in the subje ct matter, will never reach its true depth. 62 In other words, it is specifically through deep concentration upon the subject matter which one is studying that he will come to properly and truly understand it. It is only through this great investment that he can reach any true depth. Without this concentration, if he understands the subject matter at all, it will be in a completely general and external way, with no depth whatsoever. 63 This refers to the aspect of Ma’amik – Delving, which was previously ex plained. 64 The upper aspect of delving ( ma’amik ) is what arouses the power of insight ( Chochmah ) to enter and become “unified” with the power of comprehension ( Binah ). 65 This refers to the aspect of the bubbling forth of insight from the hidden spring of Chochmah into the revealed river of the comprehension of Binah . 66 See Zohar (Idra D’Mishkena) Mishpatim 123, 1. 67 Imma – Mother, refers to Binah, while Abba – Father, refers to Chochmah . This will be discussed in much greater detail later in the book. 68 In other words, the two faculties of concentration and understanding are interdependent. That is, understanding a subject matter clearly creates an interest in it. Likewise, an interest in a subject matter leads to the analysis and understanding. 69 It is s pecifically because he had this faculty of Da’at (concentration and interest, and the aspect of “delving”) that he merited the depth of the comprehension, the 50 th gate of understanding, which was previously explained. 70 This is in accordance with the stat ement, “If there is no Da’at there is no Binah , if there is no Binah there is no Da’at ”. This can be understood as follows. There must be the initial aspect of concentration ( Da’at ) in order for one to be capable of receiving the explanations ( Binah ). F ollowing, there must be the analysis to understand all the fine details of the known explanations of the subject matter ( Binah ). Through this analysis and delving into the depths ( Binah ), he can grasp hold of the essential depth of the known explanations (upper Da’at ). When this takes place, Chochmah and Binah become united, and he has a flash of insight and depth into the subject matter."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"  Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Two Now, it is known that in Binah itself there are two levels; Binah and Tvunah . (This is as stated in the Zohar 1 , “The lower mother and father are Yisrael Saba and Tvunah ” 2 . Tvunah is called the lower mother.) The matter of Tvunah is the aspect of the spreading forth of the light of Binah . This co mes about b ecause the concept is grasped very well in the vessel of the comprehension of Binah 3 . Therefore, through this, it spreads forth to bring it into many matters, whi ch are separate from the essential comprehension of the concept itself 4 . One who is capable of this is called “a man of Tvunah ”, as in the verse 5 , “Deep waters... a man of Tvunah shall draw them out”. The “deep waters” re present the aspect of the depths of Binah which remain concealed in the essential self 6 . It is specifically the “man of Tvunah ” who draw s it out and brings it forth from its concealment, to bring it to sprea d forth in many different manners , in order to quench the thirst of the recipient s 7 . This is analogous to one who draws out deep waters to quench the thirst of the sheep 8 . We may cl early observe that when the reasoning of an intellectual concept is too deep to be retained in the comprehension of man, this is called “deep waters”, which is the aspect of the depth of the comprehension ( omek hamoo sag ), from which the l ength and width come , as previously explained 9 . It is specifically one who possesses the power of Tvunah who can “draw it out”. In other words, he brings to light the aspect of the hidden de pth of the concept, until it may be retained with in the comprehe nsion of man, as if it was not deep at all. Just a s in the   1 See Zohar Ha’azinu 290b and 291a. See also Etz Chaim (Shaar Av”I) Shaar 21, chapter 8. 2 Chochmah and Binah are called “father” and “mother”. Quite simply, this is because the father ( Chochmah ) provides the seminal drop, and the mother ( Binah ) develops it into a complete “child”. Yisrael Saba refers to the seven lower emotional sefirot of Chochmah , while Tvunah refers to the seven lower emotional sefirot of Binah . For this reason they are called the lo wer father and mother. This will now be explained. 3 In other words, he has done the hitbonenut (or Iyun ) and has a firm and thorough grasp of the concept, until its very depth. According to how well he grasps the concept will be the measure of his Tvuna h . That is, his capability to apply t his concept to many other matters is commensurate to his grasp of its depth, which comes through the analysis. 4 That is to say, he is capable of applying his understanding of t his concept to many other matters , which are not directly relevant to the concept itself. 5 Proverbs 20:5 6 In other words, a person is incapable of “handing” someone the essential depth of a concept itself, for it remains concealed. Rather, he must give someone a length and width of explanation, through which the other may also be capable of grasping its depth. 7 He is capable of bringing the very essential depth out of its concealment, with many different explanations and in many different ways according to the intellectual capacities of the rec ipients. 8 As opposed to bringing the sheep down to the depths, he brings the depths up to the sheep. 9 In chapter one"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"analogy of one who draws the deep waters out of the depths of the well, he brings the depth itself close. According to the above, we must say that the power of Tvunah is a power which spreads for th from the power of Binah , to bring its depth into revelation below to the recipients. This is not the case with one who is not “a man of Tvunah ”. Although he may be a man of comprehension in his mind of Binah 10 , it is possible that his comprehension rem ains as it is in the essence of his mind of Binah 11 . That is, he only possesses “the spirit of Binah ”, but there will not come from it any spreading down into separate matters, outside of the essential comprehension itself 12 . Furthermore, although his comp rehension is in the length, width an d depth, as explained above, it is all in the essential comprehension, as it is 13 . However, it w ill not be revealed below in separate matters, and c ertainly, the depth of the concept remains in its depth, concealed in it self. Likewise, the length and width all remain in the essential comprehension, as they are, in that state alone 14 . An example of all this can be seen in the depth of the logical debate of the Talmud, in which there are many reasons and explanations to ar gue one way or another way etc. Although one may come to the comprehension of Binah 15 , nonetheless , he is still incapable of bringing to light any actual verdict or ruling of “innocent” or “guilty” from the essential intellect. In other words, one is not capable of bringing out any “guilty” verdict from this reasoning, n or any “innocent” verdict from this reasoning. This is because , as of yet, these concepts and explanations are only completely theoretical abstractions. One will , therefore , not find any spreading forth in to matters which are separate from them . In other words, he will not be capable of applying these reasons and explanations in practice and state a “guilty” or an “innocent” verdict through them. 16 Rather, it is like a Heyulie 17 power, in w hich it is not yet known what will result from it or what could be done with it.   10 Footnote of the Rebbe: This is called a “ Tafsan –Grasper” in the terminology of the world. 11 In other words, he understands the explan ation of the concept itself, but he is not capable of apply ing this concept to other matters outside of the understanding of the concept itself . This is because although he grasps the externality of the explanations of the concept, he has not grasped its true depth and essence. Therefore, although he may even be able to explain the concept to someone else, he will only be able to explain it according to his own level of understanding, and will not be able to lower it down to the comprehension of one who i s of lesser intellectual standing. Furthermore, he will only be capable of explaining it the way he received it, but will not be capable of fashioning innovative explanations and allegories. 12 He will therefore also not be capable of making any practical applications from this concept. Rather, it remains theoretical and abstract. 13 In other words, he only understands the concept in the way it was explained to him. Therefore, there is a length of explanation that he knows, and a width of facets that he ma y know how to explain according to what he received, and a concealed depth and point to the concept. H e is , nonetheless , incapable of bringing anything out of the depth, for it is hidden from him, in itself. From this we see that although one may have a g reat length and width according to what he received or read on his own, it is quite possible that he actually could be lacking the essential depth of these concepts. The way to reach the d epth is specifically through Hitbonenut , as explained in chapter on e. 14 See previous footnote. 15 That is, he understands and comprehends the reasons and explanations of both sides of the arguments. 16 He only understands the case in the Talmud and its reasoning , as it is . But he cannot practically apply this logic to the case whic h is before him, whose verdict h as not been explicitly stated in the Talmud . 17 There are two types of potentialities . The first is called a “ Heyu li e” – “ability”, and the second is called a “ Ko ’ ach ” – “ potential” . The example usually given to e xplain the difference between the se two"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" It is therefore understood that the power of Tvunah which spreads forth from the mind of Binah is the ability to bring the essential comprehension , to an aspect of spread ing down from it, in all matters wh ich are separate from the concept itself. That is to say, he is capable of arriving at a verdict whether for “guilt ” or for “innocence ” etc. Likewise, the arousal of the emotions of the heart comes from this power 18 . Furthe rmore, he is capable of bringing it into thought in many various angles 19 . How ever , at first glance , we see that in Binah itself , there exists an aspect of emotions 20 , which are called the seven lower sefirot of Binah . These are also called the emotions of the intellect which lean s either towards merit, or the intellect which leans towards guilt, as is known. However, these are only as the emotions still are concealed with in the essen tial comprehension 21 . Nonetheless, t o bring these emotions out int o revela tion in a separate matter , such as to shed light upon a certain case according to this concept and reasoning, and to actually cause the judgment on this matter to lean either to kindness or sternness ,       potentialities is th e difference between how fire exists in a coal as opposed to how it exists in a flint. There is potential fire in a coal . This potential energy is measurable . One can calculate, by the size and density of the coal , exactly how mu ch energy may be extracted from it, how long it will burn, how much heat it will produce etc. The energ y in the coal is limited. As soon as it is burned up, it no longer contains any energy . In contrast, the fire in t he flint cannot be m easured. It is unlimited . As many times as one hits the flint, that is as many times as it wil l bring out fire. T here is no point when it can no longer produce fire, and yet, there is no potential fire in the flint . The coal is an ex ample of a Ko ’ ach – a potential. The flint is an example of a He yulie – ability. This is similar to the power of speech, which is also a Heyulie ability. As much as a person may speak, it does not at all reduce his ability to speak. It is not that a perso n is born with the potential for five million words and that, as he speaks, he depletes his power of speech, until he runs out of words and becomes mute. Rather, his ability to speak is infinite, and the only factor which limits it, is his limited life spa n. Furthermore, even when he is sleeping, and his power of speech is “resting”, he still possesses the ability to speak. This is so, even though during sleep he is unconscious, and has no intention to speak. This will all be discussed in chapter ten, in g reater detail. Here, it is understood that a Heyulie is th e power of ability, and as it exists in this state, it is unknown what will be brought forth from it. For example, from the ability for movement or speech, it is not yet known where one will move, or what one will speak. It is all included in the essential ability in a completely concealed way. 18 It is specifically this power of Tvunah which brings about an arousal of the emotions from the concept which is understood. Without Tvunah the concept re mains in his mind of Binah , as an abstract “theory”. It is the power of Tvunah , the lower mother, which gives “birth” to the emotions. It is this power of Tvunah which brings out the essential depth and point of the comprehension, either into the emotion s, or any other separate matter. 19 In other words, he can bring this essential depth out in many different explanations, and is not limited to any single explanation. As explained, it is like a heyulie essence. Therefore once he has grasped this essentia l depth he is capable of bringing all manner of things from it, in many different ways, and not just a single way. 20 Here, the Rebbe is asking a question. That is, we previously said that Tvunah constitutes the emotional sefirot of Binah . But, we can cle arly observe that in Binah itself there are emotions, such as a reasoning which leans towards merit or a reasoning which leans toward s guilt. Furthermore, we know these exist even before there is any Tvunah . In other words, even before he applies this re asoning to anything it particular, and it is all theoretical, nonetheless, these intellectual leanings already exist. 21 As expl ained previously, these are similar to the inte llectual reasons to pronounce a guilt y verdict, or the intellectual reasons to pr onounce an innocent verdict. Nonetheless, it is all in theory, within the boundaries of the concept itself."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"specifically requires a man of Tvunah . It is specifica lly a man of Tvunah who can bring out insight and light, from the emotional sefirot of Binah . The meaning of “a man of Tvunah ” is that he has a thorough grasp of the essential comprehension 22 . Because of this , the comprehension spreads forth in him, to do and to shed light upon many completely separate matters. He is even capable of bring ing the depth of Binah 23 itself in to revelation, as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding. 24 For this reason Tvunah is also called Ben U’Bat – Son and D aughter , as is known . This is because Tvunah likewise possesses the three dimensions of depth, length and width. Its depth is the essential strength of the power of Tvunah (insight) of this comprehension, as it is during the time which he grasps it 25 . Th rough this (grasp) he is capable of bringing the very depths of the concept out into revelation, as was previously explained on the verse, “a man of Tvunah shall draw them (the deep waters) out”. The length of Tvunah is the descent of the concept into a s eparate matter, to shed light upon it, or to accomplish many actions through it. Its width is the aspect of the spreading forth of his Tvunah 26 in the essential comprehension itself 27 , to expand it in hi s thought in many different manners , and n ot just (in the essential manner) that it is 28 .   22 As previously explained, this deep grasp of the essence of the concept comes through the aspect of Hitbonenut (or Iyun ) which was explained in the previous chapter. 23 This refers to the omek hamoo sag – the depth of the comprehension itself. 24 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: This then is the aspect of the lower father and mother, Yisrael Sabba and Tvunah . Yisrael Sabba is the aspect of the emotions of Chochmah , and Tvunah is the aspect of the emotions of Binah . However, these two are how these emotions come into revelation, to the outside. The aspect of Malchut of Tvunah is the aspect of the intellect which comes in thought, which is called the letter s of intellectual thought ( Machshevet Sechel ), with in which the intellect becomes invested . It is the external vessel for analytical thought ( Machshava Iyunit ), which is the revelation of the comprehension of Binah itself, from the aspect of the essence o f the concept and explanation. From the aspect of Malchut of Tvunah is drawn the source of the letters of thought themselves, which is called Leah . This ( Malchut of Tvunah ) is the aspect of the large Dalet ( ד ) of the word Echad ( אחד ). [All of the above will be explained later in chapter 40. What is important to understand here is that the Rebbe has answered the previous question (see footnote 20). That is, he explained that Tvunah is the aspect of the reve lation of the emotions of Binah , while the emotions of Binah themselves refers to how they are in and of themselves, without being revealed outside to be applied to anything external to them .] 25 As previously explained, the power of Tvunah comes because of one ’ s grasp of the depth of the concept ( omek hamoo sag ). Therefore, the depth of Tvunah , i.e. its strength and power is according to how deep and strong his grasp of the essence of the concept is, while it is in his mind. This grasp of the depth of the concept itself, is exact ly the same as the depth of his power of Tvunah . 26 That is, his grasp of the depth of the concept itself. 27 This refers to the concept which he understands and grasps, itself. 28 It has already been explained that the dimensions of l ength and width are according to the depth. Therefore, immediately upon his grasp of the depth of the concept, his mind will expand with explanations and understanding of the concept from many angles. Likewise, he will immediately notice the relevance and application of this concept to other areas and aspects, and be capable of explaining it to others. One who thinks that he has grasped the depth, but is lacking in length and width (or the length and width is not commensurate to the depth which he feels that he has grasped), has certainly not grasped any depth at all. This is quite clear, for the length and width are commensurate to his grasp of the depth. (Nonetheless, it is possible fo r one to possess explanations of a subject matter without having gr asped any dept h altogether. Such a person will only be capable of repeating what he has learned, but will be incapable of innovating new explanations or applications. Likewise, he will be incapable of bringing to light a ny new angle s or insights of how to understand the subject . He will , furthermore, be incapable of bringing any of the depth of the concept to ligh t, for he does not possess its depth.)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Now, the reason that Tvunah is called Ben U’Bat – Son and Daughter 29 , is because it is specifically Tvunah which gives birth to revealed emotions as matters in and of themselves 30 . For a lthough Binah is called the “mother of the sons” 31 , nonetheless, from Binah itself, there is no birth of the emotions ( s ince it is the “upper mother” 32 ). In contrast, Tvunah is called the “lower mother”, for it is she who gives birth to the emotions. These emotions are the aspects of “Son a nd Daughter” – love and fear, which specifically come about included in Tvunah . This is because Tvunah is the aspect of the spreading forth of the light of Binah downward 33 , as explained above . It is also for this reason that the aspect of the intellect o f the emotions 34 is drawn from the aspect of Tvunah . (This is as stated 35 , “G -d founded the earth with Chochmah , and established the heavens with Tvunah ”. The first part of this verse, “G -d founded the earth with Chochmah ”, refers to the fact that “the fat her founded the daughter” 36 . The second part of the verse states, “He established the heavens with Tvunah ”. As is known, t he “heavens - Shamayim ” refers to the aspect of the emotions, fire – Esh and water – Mayim 37 . Similarly, it is stated, “ They are esta blished with Tvunah ”. This refers to the establishment of the emotions because of the aspect of Tvunah which is in them, since the aspect of Tvunah is like an intermediary to bring the intellect from the aspect of the emotions of Binah into the emotions o f the heart. This is similar to the power to bring a concept into a separate matter, which is the principal aspect of Tvunah , as explained above .) Furthermore, as is known , in Binah there is a bent Nun ( נ ) and a straight Nun ( ן ) 38 . That is to say, the bent Nun ( נ ) is the width, while the straight Nun ( ן ) is the length. Furthermore, when expanded 39 , the Nun which fills it is the straight Nun 40 , which is not the case with the   29 These refer to the actual heartfelt emotions of love and fear, as will be explained. Likewise, Zeir An pin (which represents the emotional sefirot ) is called “son”, and Malchut (which represents speech or action) is called “daughter”. These are all born of the power of Tvunah which is the lower “mother”. 30 In other words, it is specifically the power of Tvunah (the grasp of the essential depth, the seminal drop of Chochmah ) which gives birth to emotions, while Binah itself (when it lacks Tvunah ) does not. 31 See Zohar parshat VaYechi 219a. 32 See Etz Chaim (Shaar Av”I) Shaar 14, chapter 8. 33 That is it spread s forth the light of the comprehension out of the abstract and theoretical, into the practical, real, and emotional. Therefore, it is specifically Tvunah which gives rise to emotions. Nonetheless, it is the “upper mother” – Binah , which gives birth to th e “lower mother” – Tvunah . 34 The intellect of the emotions will be discussed later at greater length . Here it is important to know that it is the emotions of the intellect which become the intellect of the emotions. However, it is specifically from the aspect of the revelation of the emotions of the intellect, downward . Therefore, it is specifically from the aspect of Tvunah that the emotions become aroused. 35 Proverbs 3:19 36 This is a reference to the fact that the “daughter” – Malchut (speech) comes s pecifically from the “father” – Chochmah . This is not really releva nt here and will be explained at great length and detail later . It is the second part of the verse , which will now be explained, which is important here. 37 See tractate Chagiga 12a. Ther e it states that the Hebrew word for “heaven – Shamayim שמים ( ” ) is a conglomeration of two words, Esh ( אש ) and Mayim ( מים ), which mean fire and water. Firstly, these two elements correspond to Chessed – kindness, and Gevurah – might. Secondly, as will be explained later, the actual makeup of the emotions is from these two elements . Thirdly, it is the emotions which influence the speech and action, and therefore, the emotions ( Zeir Anpin ) are called “heaven” while speech and action ( Malchut ) which receive s from the emotions, is called “earth”. 38 See the Magen David of the Radbaz on the letter Nun . Also see Pardes Rimonim of the Ramak, Shaar HaOtiyot (27,17). 39 As previously explained, the letters can all be expanded."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"expansion of any other letters. This is because the length is included in the width. This is likewise the case with Tvunah 41 . However, in regard to the double Nun in the matter which is called Hitbonenut , as in the verse 42 , “My nation does not contemplate – עמי לא התנונן ” ; 43 this is the inner aspect of Binah , which is called Iyun , to stand upon the subject etc 44 . This is called Binah of Binah and is an intermediary between Binah and Tvunah , through the aspect of the straight Nun . For this reason it is called Hitbonenut . T his will suffic e those of understanding. 45 End of Chapter Two       40 When one expands the letter Nun – נ (as opposed to just N ) it would be spelled out as - נו \" ן . I t then includes both the bent Nun and the straight Nun . The Rebbe’s point is therefore clear, that the length is included in the width. In other words, according to the depth is the width and according to the width is the length. This is true also regarding the power of Tvunah , that it is included in the power of Binah . The power of Binah itself can be seen as the width, while the power of Tvunah is the power to draw out this width , as a leng th. What the Rebbe is bringing out is that the power of Tvunah is according to the width of Binah . 41 See previous footnote. See also footnotes 25, 28 and 33. 42 Isaiah 1:3 43 In other words, the aspect of Hitbonenut – contemplation or analysis on the known body of knowledge, brings one both to the essential understanding ( Binah ), and the capability to explain this essential understanding ( Tvunah ). 44 As explained in chapter one, this is the aspect of the investigati on into all the particular components, aspe cts and angles of a subject matter. This is a width, which leads one to the depth and length. This width, of all the particulars o f the subject matter, and all its angles, is the intermediary between Binah – the essential understanding, and Tvunah – the ability to draw out new lengths from this essential understanding. 45 From all of the above it is clear that it is Hitbonenut which is the lynch pin that awakens all the other faculties. It is specifically analysis which awakens the power of insight ( Chochmah ), and it is the understanding which awakens the interest and desire ( Da’at or Keter ). Likewise, it is through Hitbonenut that the lower mother ( Tvunah ) is aroused. Once Tvunah is aroused, the lower heartfelt emotions ( Zeir Anpin ) are awakened and one is also motivated to act ( Malchut ). This then is the reason why Hitbonenut is the chief methodology of Chassidic and K abbalistic worship of G -d. It is specifically Hitbonenut which awakens and arouses one to serve G - d completely, with one’s entir e being, with desire and interest, intellect, the emotions of lov e and fear and, finally, practical deeds ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Three From all of the above we understand that in the matter of contemplation ( Hitbonenu t ) on the comprehension of G -dliness, there are two levels, Binah and Tvunah . Binah is the aspect of the essential comprehension of G -dliness, to understand every particular of the matter which he contemplates, to understand how and what it is. He keeps his mind upon the matter with a great analysis to unders tand all of its particular components, as explained above 1 . An example of this can be understood from the comprehension of the details of Memeleh Kol Almin 2 (The fact that G -d permea tes all worlds). This is the matter of the coming into being of something from nothing, and is termed “the G -dly power and effect upon the affected” 3 . This is the aspect of the name Adon”ay ( אדנ \" י ) or the name Elokim ( אלו \" הים ), which is a terminology of power 4 , as is known. In th e externality of this matter there are many various particular facets that one must understand, until he grasps the very inner aspect of the   1 See Chapter One 2 In general, in Kabbalah and Chassidus there are two main contemplations. One is called Sovev Kol Almin – The fact that G -d encompasses and transcends all worlds, while the other is called Memaleh Kol Almin – The fact that G -d permeates all worlds. C lear ly, the first deals with how G -d literally transcends all worlds and how the worlds a re literally as nothing before H im. The second deals with how even af ter the existence of the worlds, they do not exist in any way at all separate from G -d, for H e “permeates all worlds” and is their very life force and the source of their existence . Generally, the first contemplation deals with the aspect of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum , until the aspect of Malchut of the world of Atzilut , which is still considered totally one with G -d, and is still called the world of the Infinite. In contrast, the creation of something from nothing, of the second contemplation , refers to how , the aspect of the “speech” of the King, i.e. Malchut of Atzilut , brings forth into existence the three created worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah . All of this, including both of these aspects of contemplation, and all of their various details, will be discussed and explai ned in great detail later in this book. At this point, the Rebbe is speaking about the methodology of contemplation as opposed to the actual explanations of these particulars. 3 In Hebrew this is “ Koach HaPoel Ha”Elok i B’Haniphal ”. This refers to the creation of something from nothing, i.e. the G -dly speech vested in each created being, which brings it into existence constantly. Were this force to withdraw for a single moment, the existence of the being would withdra w back into its source and it would revert to nothingness. This will be explained later. 4 The name Adon”ay means “my L -rd ”, which is a terminology of force and strength. It is known that this name refers to how Malchut of Atzilut , the speech of the “Kin g”, descends to be the enlivening force of the created worlds of Briyah , Yetzirah and Asiyah . It is therefore called the “L -rd ” over the created realms. Likewise, the name Elokim is al so a name of strength and power. This is exactly the meaning of E”l . The name Elokim represents the creative force before it descends to enliven the created worlds. The reason it is in plural form is because it represents the power of the division of speech (and of thought), to enliven each particular creation individually .

We previously explained that the aspect of Iyun - analysis 7 is the aspect of the vessel which brings one to the aspect of the depth. Th e length is the aspect of bringing the concept close to one ’ s intellect through the us e of the various known alleg ories. He does this until the matter becomes very close to his mind, by investing it in physical (analogies), to the point where even a child can grasp it , 8 as explained above. The width is to expand and explain how the matter is manifest in many different ways, as opposed to just a single way. For example, an allegory for this matter 9 may be understood from how the life force of th e soul is manifest ed in the body. Now, this is only the aspect of a spreading forth from the essence 10 , as is known. There are a multitude of other ways to understand the concept of a spreading forth from the essence . Or, regarding the concept of the revelation of that which is hidden 11 , it may be understood from the allegory of the movement of an ani mal, or from letters of speech etc. Another allegory i s the flash of insight from the essential Chochmah , or the revelation of the power of sight in the eye. A furthe r example is the revelation of the flame from the coal. All of the above allegories are examples of the concept of the revelation of that which is hidden.   5 That is to say, that there are an immense amount of facets and explanations to this concept. Nonetheless, there is an incredible difference between the grasp of these external explanations themselves, a nd the grasp of the very essence of this concept itself. That is to say, one who grasps the very essence of this concept itself literally recognizes the creation of something from nothing at every moment, continuously. There is no comparison between this type of recognition and understanding, and the comprehension of the external explanations. 6 That is, the recognition of this truth, that G - d literally permeates all worlds, is called “the depth” of this concept. 7 Or, in the terminology of Chassidus this is “ Hitbonenut ”, as previously stated. 8 For example, mathematics deals in abstractions. Rather than explaining 1 + 1 = 2 to a child, one would explain to him 1 apple + 1 apple = 2 apples. Through this he is capable of grasping the concept itself, which is invest ed within the allegory. He is then capable of separating the allegory from the analogue and understanding the original intent of addition. This is the entire purpose of allegories. Although the allegory is something separate from the true inte nt of the concept, it can contain and convey it. One must be careful though, to make the distinction between the allegory and what is contain within it. This will be explained later at great length . 9 The concept referred to here is the concept mentioned previously of Memaleh Kol Almin – How G -d permeates all worlds. 10 This allegory of the life force of the soul is only a revelation of the hidden essence of the soul, but is not the essence of the soul itself. For example, when a person does a kind act, t his is only a revelation that , in essence , he is kind, but it is not his essential kindness itself, and there is no diminishment in his essence from doing this kind act. Likewise, from this allegory it is understood in the analogue that just as the life force of the soul spreads forth to enliven the body, so does the revelation of G -d spread forth to enliven the created worlds. However, it is only a revelation of the essence, and not the actual essence of G -d Himself. This will be discussed later. The m ain point here , though , is that this is only one angle of looking at it, for there are other allegories for this concept, each of which conveys a certain facet of the concept. Through understanding each facet of each angle, and the point which each allego ry conveys, one can reach the true depth and essential point of the concept of Memaleh Kol Almin . 11 These two matters and all their allegories will be explained in chapter 19. The Rebbe’s main point in bringing these concepts here is not to explain the co ncept of Memaleh Kol Almin itself, but rather, to explain how each allegory and concept is multifaceted, and has many different angles. For the explanations of each facet of the allegories presented here, see Hillel Paritcher’s explanations to Shaar HaYic hud, chapter 3."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" In contrast, the allegories of the ray of the sun, or the light of a candle, or an applied force of energy 12 and the like, are allegories for the concept of a spreading forth from the essence. All of the above is the expansion on the essential matter 13 . The opposite of this would be the short summation and explanation of the co ncept in only one way. Mo reover , in the summation the explanation itself is in a short way, only glanced upon by the mind, without any spreading forth to expand his thoughts upon it at all 14 . In contrast, the way this concept is grasped to its essential depth after the abundant explanation and comparative analogies is called the depth and essence of this concept , as explained above . It is specifically after the length and width of the many allegories and abundant analysis that he will come to the aspect of the depth which i s under stood through them. This is to say that [he will only reach the depth], through the external enclothements 15 and abundant analysis. This will suffice those of understanding. (Everything that was previously explained regarding the particulars of Keter, Ch ochmah and Binah of Binah 16 may be found in a particular concept such as this 17 , and , likewise, in every other particular concept in the c omprehension of G -dliness, as will be explained.) Now, the aspect of Da’at is th e aspect of the recognition and feeling , i.e. the connection to the intellectual concept, as explained above . About this it is stated 18 , “ V’yadata – You shall know etc”, and “ Da et Elokei Avicha 19 – Know the G - d of your father”, which refers specifically to the comprehension of how it is that G -d permeates all worlds, as is known. It is specifically this that brings one to the aspect of the “depth of everything”, that is , the depth of Chochmah “which is found from nothing 20 ”, as explained above . In other words, this is the depth of the sight of the intellect , into this comprehension of how G -d permeates all worlds , which is higher than the actual grasp of the intellect, as is known. (This is as stated in Ra’aya Mehemnah 21 , “with the eye of the intellect, for the hea rt sees all ” 22 . This is   12 For example if one were to throw a stone, his strength and energy is contained by the stone for the duration of its flight. 13 Each of these various analogies explains the same essential concept of Memaleh Kol Almin – how G -d permeates all worlds. Each allegory provides another facet and angle of understanding of this same essential concept. That is, this concept is essential to all of these allegories. The multitude of these allegories and facets expands the essential concept and shed s light and insight to all of its various angles. 14 In other words, the understanding is in a completely general and external manner. 15 In other words, it is only through the analysis in the abundant allegories which make the concept tangible and close to his mind, that he will ever be capable of reaching the intangible depth of the concept . 16 As explained in chapter one, these three aspects refer to the depth, width and length of any concept. What the Rebbe is pointing out in this parenthesis is that this me thodology of Hitbonenut is universal to grasping the depth of any concept. 17 Referring to the concept of Memaleh Kol Almin – How G -d permeates all worlds. 18 Deuteronomy , V’etchanan, 4:39 19 Chronicles 1, 28:9 20 This refers to the ultimate depth and source o f Chochmah itself, which is Keter . The difference i s understood through the allegory of the difference in comparison between the spring and its source in the aquifer. 21 See Zohar (Ra’aya Mehemnah) Mishpatim, 116b 22 That is to say, although t his percepti on does not become invested within the logical thought of Binah , it is still possible for one to have an intuitive perception of it. Just as a person is physically incapable of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"also ca lled 23 , “Gazing at t he preciousness of the King”. Now, i n this too there is an aspect of depth, as explained above at length 24 .) Now, the aspect of Tvunah is to draw forth from this concealed depth, into revelation in the comprehension of how G -d permeates all worlds. For, since he grasps the essence of this concept very well, he is , therefore, capable of bring ing it into many separate matters 25 . For example, he can understand many details in the existence of the created w orlds , how they come into being fr om nothing to something 26 . He understands this [and draws this out] in a particular manner from the general concept of Memaleh Kol Almin , in which these particulars were concealed. Without this power of Tvunah in this comprehension of Memaleh Kol Almin , his comprehension of it would remain in his brain of understanding alone . 27 He would not know what to do with this concept, or how to bring this Hitbonenut to comprehend how his very own existence is brought about something from nothing. He would not be capable of do ing this at a ll, as is understood from all the above. This will suffice for those of understanding. (From the above we may now understand the reason for the lacking which may be found in beginners or even in those wh o are experienced , but are lacking in Tvunah . Although they       “handing” someone the essential point of a concept, and can only give the othe r person external explanations. Through these external explanations the other person is capa ble of grasping the depth of the teacher’s original intent. Likewise, here he grasps the essential depth of the concept in its undefined intangible state, and may draw explanations from there. Now, this grasp of the essence of the concept is still limited in that it is defined and confined to being an essence for this particular concept or subject matter. This would be like the depth of Binah (which is Chochmah ). Now, through delving into this itself, one can reach its depth, which is the totally undefined and intangible essence, the source of the Chochmah itself, which is the “depth of everything”, for everything originates from it. This is the grasp of the ess ential G - dliness of the concept, and it is this level which is called, “Gazing at the preciousness of the King”, (see Kuntrus HaHitpa’alut). From this we can understand the three subsequent levels of Hitbonenut - contemplation mentioned in HaYom Yom (20 Tam uz). The first is the grasp of the external explanations, and the analysis into them, with a length and width, bringing them close to one ’ s mind. Through this one reaches the second level of Hitbonenut , which is the grasp of the depth of the concepts, wh ich is the essence of this particular c oncept (and is therefore somewhat defined and limited). The third level of Hitbonenut is the delving in to the depth itself, to grasp the G -dliness of the concept. These are three subsequent levels of contemplation a nd meditation, which must follow one another, as explained. (For lengthier explanations see R’ Hillel Paritcher’s explanations to Kuntrus HaHitpa’alut.) 23 See Zohar Miketz 199a, Bereshit 38a -b, Pikudei 247b, Trumah 134a 24 The grasp of the essential depth of the concept, i.e. the essential truth of it, is this aspect of the “sight” of the intellect, which is called “Gazing at the preciousness of the King”. In this too there are different levels of depths, infinitely, as explained previously. The delving i nto the depths itself is what is called Ma’amik – Delving. See chapter 1, and also see Kuntrus HaHitpa’ alut . 25 He will recognize how G -d permeates all things particularly, as opposed to just a general understanding of the concept. 26 He will understand how each general existence of each of the worlds and each particular being of the general worlds is individually created and receives its existence from the G -dly nothing which creates it. This is as opposed to only a general understanding that “G -d creates all things from nothing”. Rather, he “sees” this in a particular fashion . Ultimately it is this power of Tvunah which relates this “abstract” concept to his own self, realizing that his very own existence is entirely dependant upon G -d, from every angle . It is specifically this type of application, which comes from the power of Tvunah , which awakens great love and awe of G -d, as explained above . 27 His comprehension of this would be abstr act and theoretical, and he would not grasp the true reality of this concept, that G -d literally permeates everything, himself included."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"grasp the explanations of the concepts well , when they hear or read them, they are incapable of bringing the matter of the coming into being of the worlds out of nothing, into contemplation during their prayer s. 28 Because of this they may reach the point where they ask themselv es, “What am I to do with all this?” and “Of what benefit is this to me ”. This is because in his mind these are two separate things, because the understanding remain s in his mind as an abstract conce pt, tot ally removed from all matter s. This will suffice those of understanding.)   28 That is, they are incapable of relating concepts such as creation ex -nihilo, back to themselves. In other words, these concepts remain theoretical to them, and they do not recognize th e true reality of these concepts, that G -d literally brings them into existence at every moment , continually. Because of this, they are not inspired with love and awe of G -d during prayer, which is the purpose of contemplation during prayer. This is simp ly because they are lacking the power of Tvunah . Because all these concepts remain as abstract theories complet ely separate from everything, a person will come to ask himself of wh at benefit is contemplating these matters altogether etc. This is only bec ause he does not relate these concepts to himself or anything else outside of the theoretic al understanding .

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Four We must now explain how one should contemplate ( Hitbonenut ), whether it should spec ifically be done in a general way, or a particular way. 1 For example, this may be understood in regard to the G -dly comprehension into the aspect of how G -d permeates all worlds ( Memaleh Kol Almin ). In the general comprehension [of how G -d permeates] the three [created] worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah , all the allegories of the ray [emanating from the luminary] , or of the spreading forth [of Divine influence] , or of the letters of speech etc, are all rooted in one general matter , that of “the revel ation of that which is the hidden” 2 . Likewise , in the general comprehension of the great difference between a created, limited being, relative to [G -d] the unlimited Being ; although there are many particular way s to understand this and although there are many details (as will be explained 3 ), nonetheless, it is all understood in a general manner . Or, on the other hand, should one contemplate in a particular manner, analyzing each world, each creature and each of the various particular levels in the entire chaining down of the worlds , from cause to [subsequent] cause, [analyzing] each one , specifically in and of itself 4 ? This, likewise , this is the question in regard to the contempl ation of the “Upper U nity”, of the lights and vessels of the world of Atzilu t , including all the details of the ten sefirot , until the essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoo t Ohr Ein Sof) . Should one contemplate this in a general mann er, i.e. the matter of the light of Atzilut , how it comes about from the e ssence   1 Should one contemplate on the matter of how G -d permeates all worlds in a general manner? This is to say that through contemplation in a general manner his understanding o f it will encompass all of created existence generally. Or, on the other hand, should one contemplate the particulars of each creation in a specific manner, to understand all the inner and out aspects of that particular world or that particular being. In such a case, it is possible for him to forget the general matter of what he is truly trying to understand, mainly, how this particular world or being is totally sublimated to G -d. The Rebbe will explain how both of these methods are necessary. He will e xplain that it is the contemplation in a general mann er of how G-d permeates all worlds (through the known allegories) that one will reach the general depth of the matter. He will also explain that it is specifically through contemplation in a particula r manner that the depth of the general matter will be brought close to one’s mind. However, one must be very careful throughout, not to forget the primary intent, which is to understand how G -d permeates all worlds. 2 This refers to the concept of Giluy H aHe’elem (revelation of the hidden). This concept and all of its analogies will be explained later in chapter 19. 3 As previously mentioned, the first part of this book (1 -9) comes to explain the methodology of Hitbonenut . All the concepts mentioned in t his section of the book will be explained in great detail in the second section (10 -54), which explains the entire chaining down of the worlds. 4 That is, should he contemplate on the particular details of the properties and facets of the created world or the specific being itself?"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"of G-d through Tzimtzum 5 and how it is in compar able to the essence of the Emanator ? Likewise [in regard to the general contemplat ion of] how “He and His life force are one” (although there are many particulars in this, as will be explained, nonetheless, it still is a gene ral contemplation). He can understand this matter, generally, through various analogies, such as the analogy mentioned in Sefer Yetzirah of a flame whi ch is bound to the coal, or such as a general understanding of the revelation of the faculties of the so ul from their concealment in the essence of the soul. Through this analysis he will come to comprehend the depth of the concept of how G -d permeate s all worlds, which is called , “The Lower U nity”. Now, in truth, the two 6 are dissimilar to each other. [On the one hand] t here is a n advantage to general contemplat ion, that through it one will be able to come to the general depth of the matter, which is the general aspect of the ess ence of the G -dly light. [However] he will reach this only in a general way, w hether in regard to t he comprehension of the “Upper Un ity”, or the “Lower U nity” 7 . This revelation of G -dliness in his sou l is the ultimate purpose of contemplation. [On the other hand] t here is also a n advantage to contemplating in a particular way, spec ifically, since [through it] the revelation of the G -dly light in his soul will be incredibly close r to him. For, through contemplat ion in a general way it is possible for one to delude one self, so that it a ppears to him that this matter is very close to him . In truth , though, when he only contem plates in a general manner, G -d appears to him from afar . This is not the case when one contemplates in a particular manner, to comprehend all the details of each particular . When he does this, it become s embedde d in his soul in a very close way . From this, he will come to comprehend a higher particular, on a higher level 8 , until he comes to the general comprehension of the general matter 9 . In this way the comprehension is truer, without deluding himself at all. For example, when he starts contemplating the matter of how G -d permeates all worlds, in a particular manner, he begins by contemplating how the root of the spiritual influence of the orbits and constellations come into actuality, ou t of nothing, from the waste matter of the Ophanim angels. 10 Afterwards , he contemplate s the Ophanim angels, and Chayot angels in a   5 This will be explained in chapters 12, 13 and 14. 6 “The two” refers to “general contemplation” and “particular contemplation”. 7 As mentioned previously, these two aspects, the “Upper Unity” and the “Lower Unity” refer to the two aspects of how G -d encompasses and transcends all worlds, and how he permeates all worlds. 8 In other words, he analyzes and investigates the particular details of a particular matter, until it is completely clear and close to his mind. He then moves on to a higher particular matter, contemplating all of its particular details. An example of this will be given momentarily. In any case, after having gone through each particular of the order of creation, piece by piece, particular by particular, when he then grasps the general matter of how G -d permeates all worlds, all of these particulars become unified in this general understanding. The result is an incredibly greater understanding which is far closer to his mind than if he would only contemplate in a general manner. 9 This refers to the general comprehension of how G -d permeates all worlds ( Memaleh Kol Almin ). 10 The first thing that he should contemplate is something that is very close to him. That is, the physical world. In our physical world he should begin by contemplating how ever ything on our planet receives its sustenance and influence from the sun and the other planets and constellations. For example, all vegetables and plant matter basically take sunlight and convert it into plant life. W hether these particular vegetables will be in season is also determined by the influence of the planets and constellations. Furthermore, how"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"particular manner etc. This contemplation continues until he reaches the aspect of Malchut of the world of Asiyah , which is the general G -dly ligh t that brings the world of Asiyah into being . He continue s in this way, contemplating the details of the ten sefirot of the world of Asiyah until he reaches the aspect of Malchut of Yetzirah , which becomes the Keter for the world of Asiyah . In this manne r he contemplate s the particulars of the world of Yetzirah , and [then] the particulars of the world of Briyah . He continues in this way until he reaches the aspect of Malchut of Atzilut , which is the totality of everything, and is generally called by the name Elokim , as is known. In this way, after thorough analysis , he realizes the truth of the matter , in a way of great closeness. For, although , in and of itself, each particular of his contemplation is generally not a matter of G -dliness and is only a particular which is of secondary importance, nonetheless, when his whole analysis of all the particulars , comes together and become s bound to the general principle, then the general principle will become       much money one will have to purchase these fruits or vegetables is also determined by these forces. (For example, in the winter he will have to pay for heating, and in the summer, he will have to pay for cooling, etc. Whether it will rain and his crops will grow with great abundance, or whether there will be drought and famine, is also determined by these forces.) It has even been discovered that sunspots have an actual effect on our mood and well being, even though the sun is 93,000,000 miles from the earth. (These matters have been known in Kabbalah for thousands of years.) In any case, all influence on our plan et is drawn from the sun and other planetary forces. This is the first thing to contemplate in detail, to understand the particulars of this. Following this, he contemplates how great the energy of the sun is. For example, if energy = money, then if he would be capable of harnessing the energy of even a fraction of the sun, his wealth would be mind boggling. As we just explained, all the energy of this planet is derived from the sun. Furthermore, what could be achieved with this much energy also stagge rs the mind. Once he understands this clearly, and all the particulars of it, he continues his contemplation, by going up one level. He now contemplates how the energy of the sun is literally as nothing compared to the energy of our entire galaxy. The s un is not even like a grain of sand in the Sahara desert compared to the many millions upon millions of stars in our galaxy alone and the galaxy is as nothing compared to all the galaxies in the universe. By contemplating this, and understanding it, speci fically and thoroughly, the incredible amount of energy in our universe will stagger his mind. After he thoroughly comprehends this, he should go up another level and contemplate how the entire universe, with all its incredible energy, is merely induced by the waste matter of the lowest order of angels, which are called the Ophanim . The entire universe does not actually come from these angels themselves, but is only induced by a tiny speck of their waste matter. This means that our entire universe is lite rally, absolutely nothing in comparison to a speck of waste matter of the lowest order of angels. Their waste matter is immeasurably greater than our entire universe and its energy totally boggles the human mind. Now, here we are only talking about a spe ck of their waste matter, but, obviously, the Ophanim angels themselves are infinitely greater than this. The energy of a single Ophan angel is absolutely beyond human comprehension. A single Ophan angel could destroy our entire physical universe and it would not even be an infinitesimal fraction of a fraction of its true strength. However, all this is as nothing, for there are one million Ophan angels per troop. This too is as nothing, for, as it states, “ Ligdudav Ein Mispar – His troops are innumerable ”. This is to say that there are infinite troops. At this point one contemplates the particular details of the Ophanim angels, to understand exactly what they are in a detailed manner, until this too comes close to his mind. He the n continues to a highe r level , contemplating how the Ophanim angels only receive their influence from the order of angels above them, which are called the Chayot . This is as stated, “ Umekablin Dein Min Dein – They receive, one from the other etc”. This type of contemplation c ontinues in a particular manner, understanding the details of each level until one reaches the level of Malchut of the world of Asiyah from which all of the lower levels derive their very existence. In this manner one will come to appreciate and truly fee l the truth of these levels, and how they are all literally totally sublimated and as nothing relative to G -d, and that their entire existence is totally and absolutely dependent on Him. However, one is only capable of doing this type of contemplation aft er he has first received the explanations of the entire chaining down of the worlds from the top to the bottom, which will be explained in the second part of this book (chapters 10 -54)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"embedded in his soul in a greater degree.

(For , through this, it is possible f or him to fall into false delusions, as do fools and those who lack Da’at .

However, the focusing and delving of one ’ s concentrati on into each detail is the opposite o f error and distance [from G -d].

In truth, they have invested themselves greatly in acquiring this general comprehension of how G -d permeates everything. The problem stems from the fact that they err in themse lves, thinking that they have a mastery of these concepts and that they are very close to G -d. This is itself a delusional misunderstanding which comes about only because they have not contemplated in the particular manner described above.

That is t o say, this is the depth of the comprehension as it flashes from the “nothingness” of the spring of Chochmah , into the “somethingness” of the river of Binah . As previously mentioned, the aspect of Binah , or analysis, is the aspect of “dissecting and takin g the concept apart”. The flash of the depth of the concept is what unifies all the parts back together, so that all the particulars of the concept come together as a whole. This is what a Yichud - unification is. 14 There are two aspects in this. Firstl y, the actual point of the contemplation is to grasp how the “something” is literally sublimated to its source in the “nothing”. This is the purpose of contemplation in both the upper unity and in the lower unity. Secondly, when he grasps this depth, in effect, what is happening is that the “something” of his Binah comprehension becomes sublimated before the “nothing” of his Chochmah - insight . 15 That is to say, the point is to understand the depth of these two concepts, how G -d encompasses and transcends a ll worlds, and how he permeates all worlds.

The above is an example of a particular Yichud . 18 In other words, one should strive to understand how G -d transcends and permeates each particular creation of all the worlds in a particular mann er as opposed to only a general understanding, which will now be explained. 19 That is, these two verses indicate in a general way how G - d transcends all worlds, how “He is the place of the world, while the world is not His place” etc. 20 That is, the entire existence of the created worlds is barely an infinitesimal fraction of revelation of the infinite potential of Malchut of Atzilut to create. Moreover, Malchut of Atzilut itself is only a particular and finite revelation in comparison to its essence in th e desire, just as a human being’s speech and expression is incomparably limited relative to his power of desire. 21 That is, the sublimation of the entire line of limited revelation of our existence to its source in the essence of the Living G -d. All the p articulars mentioned in this chapter will be explained at length in Part two of this book (chapters 10 -54). 22 In this case, his understanding and realization of the general matter of how G -d permeates and transcends all worlds will be true and deeply embed ded in his soul. This is because he brings this general matter close to his understanding by the thorough study of its particulars. In contrast, if one skips the particulars and only contemplates on the general concept, his understanding of it will be ex ternal and general, and he will be incapable of truly relating it to himself."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"This , then , is the meaning of “ the particular requires the general and the general requires the particular” 23 , for no general concept can exist without particulars 24 . (This matter has already been debated by many of the foremost Rishonim, such as Maimonides and the Tur . That is, whether durin g prayer one ’ s intentions should be focused on the particular meanings of the words, [such as] contemplating the greatness of G -d [in a particular way ]? Or, should one ’s intent rather be to re alize , in a general way , before whom he is standing and praying? This matter is discussed in Chassidic manuscripts) . Now, although [as a rule] a general thou ght and a particular thought cannot coexist , nonetheless, he who delves with all of his heart and with all his desire, specifically to contemplate the essence of G -dliness, ev en though his analysis is into the particulars, he will specifically direct everything to the general thought of G-d ’s essence . He will not fall from the general intention at all, as a result of focusing on the particulars. This is becaus e all the particulars are drawn to and follow the general principle , as is known to all those who travel upon the “Path of T ruth ” , [who direct themselves ] specifically only to G -d. Likewise, this is as stated by t he Sages, “[pray to Him] rather than to His attributes”. This is to say that the main intent of the matter of conte mplating the particulars is solely for the specific purpose of coming to the Essential S elf and being of G -d Himself . In o ther words, one should never consider the particulars to be the main thing, such as study ing a subject in and of itself [rather than to know G -d] 25 . Likewise, one’s analysis of the Zohar and the writings of the Ari ’zal must be specifically in this manner. This will suffice those of understanding. (My father, our master, mentor and teacher [the Alter Rebbe] of blessed memory, whose soul rests in Eden , received this teaching from the mouth of the Rav , the Maggid [of Mezeritch] of blessed memory, with a full explanation, and this is how I heard it from hi s mouth .) Through all of the above we have answered the question of those who inquire regarding the specific [kabbalistic] meaning s of the words of the prayers. H ow is it that those who know them do not beco me confuse d [and distracted] from the general intent ? Rather, on the contrary, the intent of the meaning of the words of prayer , as explained by Kabbalah , 26 serves to strengthen the depth of one ’ s general grasp of the essence of G -d, as is known to those w ho have tasted [the contemplation of the words of the prayers ] in a particular manner. However, for those who are novices, 27 it is best that at first they should delve in a general w ay, until they become accustomed , little by little, to particular contempl ation [during prayer] , specifically. This will s uffice those of understanding. 28   23 See Zohar Shmot 3a, Terumah 161b, V’Etchanan 264a. 24 In other words, if a general rule is lacking particulars, then it is not a general rule. The opposite is likewise true, if a particular is lacking a general, then it is not a particular of anything. The both are necessary to any concept. What is understood here, however, is that both the particular contemplation and the general concept are necessary to any understanding. O ne who understands a multitude of particulars, but is lacking the general concept which unifies them, cannot understand their depth or true point whatsoever. The reverse is likewise true. One who understands the general concept, but is lacking its partic ulars will only achieve a very shallow understanding, with no true depth at all. 25 Rather, even when he is studying the particulars, his entire intent and focus is to know G -d through them. 26 That is, particular contemplation. 27 This refers to those who ar e new to the methodology of Kabbalah and Chassidus, i.e. Hitbonenut contemplation during prayer. 28 In conclusion, it is clear that both general and particular contemplation are required. That is, the particular contemplation should be completely directed towards the general point. In other words, one"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Five After having explained the need to contemplate specifically in a particular manner , it follows , of necessity, that one must know all the particular levels in all the details of the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder HaHishtalshelut ) of Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah , so that one may contemplate them. These particulars can not be u nderstood by everyone through the general teachings [of Kabbalah and Chassidus]. Therefore, whatever needs explanation in each detail , will all be explained in a special pamphlet 1 , so that a person of understanding 2 will automatically under stand them and w ill know many other details 3 . However, it is first necess ary to introduce one more point (which also will be explained in detail) of how Hitbonenut contemplation should be d one. This is extremely necessary for all those who truly desire close ness to G -d and do not merely seek to fulfill their obligations, and deceive themselves [that they are thereby truly serving G -d] etc. As known , every contemplation upon the G -dly matter of the creation of something from nothing, each contemplation according to its p lace [in the order of things], includes two matters; The first is the aspect of the sublimation of the “something” to the “nothing”. This begins with the comprehension of the relativity of limited beings 4 , by understanding how their existence is derived from th e “nothingness”. This is brought close to the intellect through various explanations and analogies and the like, until the truth of it becomes well settled in his mind .   1 This refers to the second part of this book from chapter 10 -54, where the Rebbe explains all the details upon which one should contemp late. 2 In the original Hebrew “a person of understanding” is called by the term “ Mayvin ”. This means a person who actively engages in analyzing a subject until he understands it, i.e. Hitbonenut. These two words are different conjugations of the same thr ee letter root. Hitbonenut (Analysis) is the act of understanding and a mayvin is the person who understands. 3 In other words, the Rebbe will explain all of the principles and particulars of the entire Seder Hishtalshelut (Chaining down of the worlds) . (This is as stated in the Rebbe’s introduction, that he “will explain a summation of everything that is possible for a human being to bring close to his mind and heart...Including all the particulars of the entire Seder Hishtalshelut ”.) One who properly c ontemplates and understands the second part of this book (in a way of Tvunah ) will also come to understand things that were not said outright. (He will even be capable of understanding particulars up to the 5 th power (and more), as the Rebbe promises in t he beginning of chapter 10.) It is for this reason that this book is called “the Key to Chassidus” (see HaYom Yom). 4 That is, one is to understand the properties and limitations of created beings, and understand how they derive their existence and are to tally dependent on the G - dly “nothingness”. More importantly, one must realize that this relates specifically to himself. These are not merely abstract concepts, but relate to him personally, for he is not outside of the equation."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" The second matter is the aspect of the G - dly “nothingness” which creates him, and how He [G -d] is totally separate, relative [to created beings], since He has no limitations. This matter is concealed from the eyes of the intellect and cannot be grasp ed completely . However, the truth of it will , nonetheless , flash like lightning in his brain, so that he will glimpse it, as it is. However, although it is in an aspect of concealment, it will be as true for him as if he saw it with physical sight 5 . Th is is the difference between the aspect of the “ sight ” of Chochmah , [and the aspec t of the “hearing” of Binah ]. The sight of Chochmah , the Koach Ma”h 6 (the power of “what”), is the sight of the s oul which sees, but not with ta ngible sight. Rather, it is a flash of intellectual sight which is beyond complete comprehension. Therefore, the arousal which results from it is nothing but the aspect of sublima tion, which is the complete absence of awareness of self. The aspect of the “hearing” of Binah , on the other hand, come s with complete comprehension, literally. This is to say that he comprehends how the “something” comes into existence f rom the “nothing”, as explained above . The resulting arousal is a tangible feeling of joy and good -heartedness. The more he grasps, the better he feels and the more he delves into it , the more he gras ps. In con trast, the aspect of the “sight” of Chochmah is the opposite. The more he delves into it, the more the G - dly “nothingness” which creates , becomes removed and astounding to him. This astonishment over the awesome gap and absence of any comparis on [between G-d, who is beyond all limit, and himself ], grows and grows, until he is bewildered and consternated over it etc 7 . According to the above , all those who contemplate in a particular manner [rather than a general manner] will become [aware of] these two aspects through their contemplation; the concealed 8 aspect and the revealed 9 aspect. Accordi ngly, the arousa l which is born of it [is comprised of ] two opposites; “His heart is worried within him” 10 because he comprehends the astounding greatness of the G - dly “nothing” which creates, but he is [simultaneously] joyful because of his thorough grasp of how all that exists comes into being . This may be understood by example of one who contemplates in a particular manner into the coming into being of the planetary orbits from the G - dly “nothing”, which comes about from the aspect of the external vessels of Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah . In other words, he comprehends how it is only from the external vessels and is merely a glimmer of a glimmer,   5 G- d’s existence is tru e for him as if he saw it, literally. However he cannot comprehend what it is that he saw, since that remains concealed. 6 The letters of Chochmah ( חכמה ) can be rearranged to spell Koach Mah ( כח מה ), meaning “the power of ‘what’”. This represents the aspe ct of the sublimation to G -d of Chochmah , as in the verse, “ V’Nachnu Mah – and what are we”. 7 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (as it is written in Chassidic Manuscripts). 8 This is the delving into the G - dly “nothingness” which is concealed, as explained above . 9 This is the delving into the created, and how they are created “something from nothing”, which is revealed. 10 See Tractate Chagigah 13a"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"which r adiates within the soul of the planet as it grasps that which gives it its existence. Likewise, he understands how the angels of the world of Briyah, (“I n which Imma ( Binah of Atzilut ) resides” ), comprehend the G -dly power of Malchut of Malchut of Atzilut which brings them into existence. He grasps these concepts in a w ay of comprehension, and he become s aroused by the greatness of the Crea tor, and how they [the angels and planets ] are constantly sublimated [to Him] , as stated, “And the hosts of the heaven s bow down to You”, in their orbits etc. However, the aspect of the G - dly “nothingness”, the essential creative force of Malchut of Asiyah , is conc ealed from his grasp. However, it is automatically forced into his com prehension, because the understanding of how the “something” comes into existence has become true for him . 11 Furthermore, it is only comprehended in a c oncealed way, specifically because of the astonish ment over the total absence of comparison . This is likewise so in the contemplation of the particulars of the world of Atzilut , in its lights and vessels. For example, the contemplation on the light of Chessed of Malchut of Atzilut , or the contemplation on the light of Chessed of Chochmah of Atzilut , to understand how they were emanated. This can be comprehende d by way of analogy from how light is emanated into revelation from its concealment in the essence 12 , here below [in the physical world] . This is also similar to how Moshe, “emanated from his spirit” 13 , and the like. Furthermore, although the emotive attributes ( Midot ) of the world of Atzilut are only in the aspect of sources , 14 and are separate from the G -dly influence as it is within C reation 15 , he will , nonetheless, compreh end how they come into being . However, the aspect of the true “not hing ness ” which shines upon them from the light of the essence [of G -d], which emanates them , cannot be grasped even through intellec tual comparisons. Rather, it may only be [grasped] in a concealed fashion, which is the aspect of the intellectual sight, which is higher than actual comprehension and grasp. This is like the saying, “No thought can grasp You”, which refers to the thought of Binah . In other words, this is the opposite of comprehension 16 , for the more he delves [into it] , the more astounding will the esse ntial light   11 See chapter 4, footnote 10. After comprehending how our entire universe is brought into existence by only a glimm er of a glimmer of waste -matter from the lowest order of angels of the world of Asiyah , by logical necessity, one is forced to say that our entire universe is as nothing compared to it. Nonetheless, the existence of these beings, and the G -dly creative fo rce itself, remains concealed. 12 The analogies for this will be given later in chapter 19. In general though, through understanding the allegory, like the revelation of the light of the soul to enliven the body etc, one can then understand how things are above. 13 Moshe “emanated” a spirit of prophecy to the elders. However, this was only an emanation and revelation, rather than the essence of the spirit of prophecy of Moshe himself. This will also be explained later at length, in the explanation of the “ emanation” and revelation of the concealed. 14 That is to say, the sefirot of the world of Atzilut are still totally unlimited and undefined. They are called by Sefer Yetzirah , “Ten sefirot without whatness”. That is, the sefirot of Atzilut are themselves undefined, and are only the sources for what will later come into defined created existence. However, he will comprehend the nature of this as well, as will later be explained. 15 That is, they are the source of the divine influence, but they, themselves, transcend Creation. Rather, it is the light of Malchut of Atzilut which becomes invested within creation. The source of the light of Malchut of Atzilut , are these emotive attributes of Atzilut ( Zeir Anpin ). The light of Zeir Anpin itself does not becom e invested within creation, and is completely removed from it, remaining only as “the source”. This will be explained at length in the second part of the book. 16 That is, comprehension means a total “something”, which is a completely concrete and tangible description. The “Undefinable” is therefore clearly ungraspable in a way of comprehension. Rather, the more one delves into it, the more astonished he will become."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of the Emanator be for him. The indication of this [type of arousal] is that a very great aspect of sublimation is born [in him] 17 . [From all the above] we find, that of necessity the [opposite] aspects of sublimation and jo y whic h branch out and are born of the Chochmah and Binah [i.e. contemplation] o f each particular, specifically come together, as one. This is true of all Hitbonenut - contemplation of each particular detail , specifically. These two aspects 18 are interdependent. If he has no joy from the thorough comprehension of the “something”, then he will also not come to the astonish ment and sense of distance in his inability to grasp t he “nothing ness ”. T he degree of his joy is , literally, commensurate to the degree of his sublimation , for his comprehension of the created is commensurate to his astonish ment at the separation of the Creator. This is an important principle [which applies to] every Hitbonenut -contemplation, whether general or particular. (In contrast, if it a ppears to someone that he thoroughly grasps the aspect of creation, but he is lacking in sublimation to the Creator, then, without a doubt , it is a certain ty that he has not grasped anything. Likewise, if some one imagines that he possesses the aspect of s ublimation through the realization of the wondrousness of the Creator, but he does not thoroughly comprehend the manner of how [everything] has come into being , it is a false imagination and he has no sublimation whatsoever. T hese two are interdependent a nd commensurate to each other, for the above mentioned reason. This is known to all those who have tasted true Hitbonenut , and do not at all delude themselves. This is likewise understood by those who are accustomed to the teachings of Chassidut from thei r youth. However, a great many pe ople delude themselves in all this, in many different ways etc.) End of Chapter Five   17 In other words, according to the depth of his delving into this aspect of the sight of Chochmah , the more astounding and removed the essence of G -d will be for him. The more astonishing it is, the more sublimated will he be to the essence of G -d, as explained previously. 18 This refers to the aspect of the sublimation and the joy, which are born of the particular contemplation. These two aspects, the Chochmah and the Binah , are interdependent, and therefore the sublimation and the joy are also interdependent."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"  Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Six The statement 1 , “ Weep ing is affixed in my h eart on this side and joy on that side” , is well known . This is to say that one must prepare his soul for the general knowledge of the chaining down ( Hishtalshelut ) of the Infinite Light in the worlds of ABY”A 2 , until his soul becomes a fitting recept acle for this. This can only come about through these two matters of weeping and rejoicing . For, although they are two opposites, nonetheless, they come together , literally as one, specifically from the same contemplation . It is specifically through this th at his soul become s well prepared, so that the comprehension of the particulars of the Infinite Light in the worlds of ABY”A become embedded in the essence [of his soul] . If either of these 3 is missing , in other words, if there is one without the other, [then it is certain that nothing has become embedded in his soul]. E ven if it appea rs to him that both are in his heart , but they are not within his soul truly and deep ly, but only in an external, passing way , this is a sure sign that nothing has become em bedded in his soul, except from a very great distance 4 . With the slightest opposition, such as being greatly occupied 5 or from an increased sense of self and ego, it 6 will be completely up rooted from his heart . As is known, t he explanation of these matte rs is that pleasure and joy are in Chochmah and Binah . Pleasure is in Chochmah (insight), and joy is in Binah (comprehension) 7 . (As is known,   1 See Zoh ar II, page 255a, Zohar III, page75a, also see Tanya, end of chapter 34. 2 This is an acronym for the worlds of Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 3 Joy and weeping (love and fear) 4 That is to say, without both of these aspects, it is certain that his perception of G -dliness was only from a very great distance, if at all. It is necessary for both of these aspects, Joy and weeping (or love and fear) to be present, in order to come close to G - d. These two, love and fear, are called, “ Trayn Gadfin D’Parc hin L’Eiylah – The two wings which fly upward”. That is, these are the two wings which bring one close to G-d. However, just as the two wings of a bird must be equal in proportion to each other for flight to occur, so too, these two must likewise be pro portionate to each other. Furthermore, the strength of the wings is what determines the heights to which the bird may soar. Likewise here, it is the strength and depth of these two aspects which will determine how close one may come to G -d. 5 Such as, in matters of securing a livelihood... 6 That is, with the slightest opposition, the little bit of love and fear that he possessed will be completely uprooted from his heart. This is because they were not embedded into the very depths and essence of his being in the first place. Because of this, it is possible for him to forget about the Creator. 7 As explained previously, Chochmah is the seminal flash of insight and understanding into a subject matter. However, the seminal flash of insight itself (the Omek Hamoosag ) is beyond concrete grasp and comprehension. Nonetheless, the “grasp” of this depth produces the effect of sublimation to the depth of the concept being studied. In other words, his self is so involved in the grasp of the concept that he is unaw are of himself. When he grasps this depth, the effect is a totally sublime pleasure and bliss. In contrast, Binah is the aspect of concrete comprehension, in the way of a “something”, which is felt. The"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"this is the difference between Shabbat and Yom Tov . 8 ) The comprehension of the intellect gives rise to joy, that is, the joy of the soul. This is as stated 9 , “The mother 10 of the children rejoices ”. More over, as is known , the primary so urce of joy is specifically in G -dliness, as stated 11 , “ They will rejoice in You” , specifically. No w, we explained previously in reg ard to the comprehension [of Binah ], th at “no thought can grasp Him”. Quite the contrary, H e is astounding in the great degree of His separation . 12 This is the aspect of the Koach Ma”h (the power of “what”) of Chochmah , [ in which the per ception] is conceal ed, as explained above. T his being the case , it should be the opposite ; 13 that joy is not into G - d’s essence. For, as soon as he comprehends it, it can no longer be His [G - d’s] true essence, but rather only an aspect of how He restrains 14 Himself in order t o bring the created into being. Accordingly, Chochmah , which is the aspect of “nothingness” , as previ ously explained, is where it would be fitting for the joy of “we will rejoice in You” to exist . However, this is not the case , for as is known, sublimati on , which is the opposite of joy, is specifically in Chochmah , while joy is in Binah . Rather, as is known, the ex planation of this is that everything contains its opposite. Moreover , althou gh it is revealed as its actual opposite, from this [fact] itself we see that its whole force is only due to the opposing force . 15 Furthermore, th e strength of the opposing force is [always] commensurate to the strength of its opposite, literally. If so, they are literally as one .       effect of this concrete comprehension is Joy which is different from the peaceful bliss of pleasure. As opposed to pleasure, which is an internal, inward feeling, joy is an outpouring of happiness, which spreads out into other matters. 8 Generally, Shabbat is called Kodesh – Holy and Separate. That is, it is a thing unto itself. On Shabbat one does not interact with the world, but rather, it is a day of interaction with G -d. Furthermore, it says, “You shall call Shabbat pleasure”. This then is the relationship between Shabbat , Chochmah , and pleasure. In contrast, in regard to Yom Tov (the Holidays) it is stated, “You shall be joyful on your holidays”. Furthermore, on the holidays one is permitted to do various types of labor and interaction with the world, such as cooking etc. We therefore understa nd the relationship between Binah , which is the aspect of Joy, and Yom Tov. This will all be explained in greater detail in chapter 26. 9 Psalms 113:9 10 Chochmah is called Father, and Binah is called Mother. This is because it is Chochmah which provides the seminal flash of insight and intuition, while it is the brain of Binah which develops that seminal flash into a full blown concept. Furthermore, as explained, it is from Binah that the “children”, i.e. the emotions, are born. 11 See the Amidah prayer f or the holidays. 12 In other words, we previously explained that regarding G - d’s essence, the thought of Binah can have no grasp of it. It is only the perception and “sight” of (the Koach Ma”h of) Chochmah which can have a glimpse of the truth of G - d’s ess ence, but only in a concealed way. How, then, can we say, “We will rejoice in You”, signifying a comprehension of the aspect of Binah into G - d’s essence? 13 It should be the opposite, i.e. that joy is from the aspect of Chochmah , which has a glimpse into t he essence of G -d. In Binah , as soon as he has a comprehension of it, it can no longer be the essence of G -d, since comprehension is absolutely defined and limited. The above statement, “we will rejoice in You”, which refers to the comprehension of Binah , is therefore not understood. 14 Tzimtzum. This will be explained in chapters 12 and 13. 15 For example, pleasure and pain are two opposites, but they are the very same power, as will be explained momentarily. For example, the pleasure one has in a certain thing will be the pain at his separation from it. They are literally commensurate to each other. Therefore, it is specifically from the opposite of pleasure, which is pain, that we can actually gauge how much pleasure a person has in something."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"An example of this is pleasure and pa in. Commensurate to the degree of a person’s pleasure in some thing, will be the degree of the ar ousal of pain, which is the absence of the pleasure which opposes [the pain]. This takes place should somethi ng stand in opposition, to negate that pleasure , since that is its opposite 16 . The opposite is true as well. The degr ee of his pleasure in something cannot be recognized except through the degree of pain he has when that thing is missing 17 . We see that this is literally one force, except that it divides into two equal lines which are literally in equal balance to e ach other. The o ne side will not be stronger than the second, even to the amount of “the thorn of a Yud ” 18 . The same [principle] applies to joy and weeping 19 . To t he degree of his joy, which i s a felt and rev ealed pleasure when G -dliness is revealed in his grasp, as explained above , so will be the degree of the second side , 20 which specifically comes out of it and from its power. Th is [second side] is the weeping over the lack of revealed light in his soul , because G -dliness is concealed [from him], until he literally despises his life. The more one has tasted the flavor of Divine pleasure with rejoicing , the more embittered will he be in his soul from its opposite. Likewise, the opposite is [also] true. From the degree of the depth of his bitterness and weeping, that he despises his physical life , is the strength of his pleasure and joy in G -dliness recognized. This is the gauge for the measure of its strength. This is because these two lines are counterbalanced with absolute equilibrium , as explained above. This , then , is the meaning of “ Weeping is affixed in my heart on this sid e and joy on that side”, with equal measure , literally. 21 Likewise, even higher than this is the aspect of the con cealed pleasure of Chochmah . It is from this, ( the depth of his pleasure which is concealed in his essence, 22 ) that the aspect of a   16 Commen surate to one’s pleasure in any given thing will be his pain at the lack of this pleasure. The lack of the pleasure comes about because of some kind of opposing force. So, for example, one’s pleasure in living is not revealed until an “opposing force” co mes to bring his life to an end (G -d forbid). It is specifically then that his pleasure in living will become revealed through the revelation of his pain in its opposite. For example, one does not realize how much he appreciates and enjoys breathing unti l he can no longer breathe. This is not to say that he did not appreciate and delight in breathing before, only that usually he is unaware of it. What reveals it, is its opposite, the opposing force. From this we see that the pleasure in something and t he pain when it is lacking are literally commensurate to each other. According to how much pleasure he takes in any given thing that will be the amount of pain at the lack of it. 17 See the previous footnote, and the example of how one’s appreciation of li fe becomes revealed only when there is some opposing force threatening to remove his life (G -d forbid). 18 That is, the two sides of the “scale” are absolutely equal, and one side will not “outweigh” the other, even the slightest amount. 19 This refers to t he statement quoted at the beginning of this chapter, “Weeping is affixed in my heart on this side and joy on that side”. These two sides are literally commensurate to each other, as will now be explained. 20 This refers to the pain at the absence of reve lation of G -dliness. 21 All of the above refers to the joy and pain which are born of Binah comprehension. The Rebbe will now discuss the aspects which are born from the pleasure of Chochmah . 22 Just as with any other great pleasure, one’s entire being is c ompletely invested into it, i.e. he is sublimated to it, to the point where he is aware of nothing but it. Here too, when one is having a flash of insight, and specifically a flash of the Truth of G -d, although the pleasure itself in this is a concealed pleasure, he is totally unaware of himself but rather only of the object of his pleasure, in this case G -d. This is the sublimation which is borne of the concealed pleasure of Chochmah (which is called Eden – pleasure)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"total and complete sublimation of him self comes . Theref ore, its opposite , which is born of its streng th, is the matter of c asting his soul 23 against anything which opposes this . For, this is included in the aspect of his ego 24 .

My flesh and my heart fail: but G -d is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.” For, these two lines are [literally ] o n equal balance, as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding. Now , there is [an aspect of] weeping which is even higher than this 26 . This comes about out of the lack of comprehension [into G -dliness] because [G -d] is so absolute ly and awesomely beyond any relativity [to him] since the vessel of his brain cannot contain it 27 . This is like how, “The eyes of Rabbi Akiva flowed with tears” 28 because of the deep secrets which the vessel [of his brain] could not contain . This i s the aspect of the astonishment at the “conceal ed of all concealments”, i.e. literally the Essence o f the Infin ite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), which is beyond comprehension whatsoever. On the contrary, the more one delves into it , the mo re astonished he becomes, as previously mentioned. S pecifically from this his heart becomes [filled] with consternation and he w eeps . This only comes because of his immense pleasure and des ire to comprehend, which he is in capable of doing . 29   23 With complete self -sacrifice. 24 This is to say, his very ego and self is invested in this to the point that this itself is his ego. Therefore, anything which opposes it brings out his essential self and ego in opposition. Just as when a person’s ego or sense of self is threatened, it c omes out full force against this opposition, here too, when his “ego”, i.e. his total sublimation, awareness and pleasure in G -d, is threatened, his entire self comes out in opposition to it. Another explanation of this can be understood from an entirely different angle. That is, his ego and sense of self itself is in opposition to this total sublimation to G -d. Therefore, because of his total sublimation and pleasure in G -d, he will be pained by any awareness and sense of self, to the point where he wil l literally despise anything aside from G -d, including himself. This is to say, he will be pained at his very existence and awareness of self. His sole refuge and desire is awareness of G -d, which is its opposite. 25 This is to say, his entire self and “e go” is invested in G -d and the revelation and awareness of G -d, to the point where he will do anything for G -d, even to the point of death. His entire life will be invested in revealing G -d everywhere and in everything, for he will despise anything and an ywhere where this revelation is lacking. To him, G -d is everything and without G -d everything is clearly worthless and purposeless, as portrayed by the verses which the Rebbe quotes. 26 That is, it is higher than both of the two levels mentioned above. 27 This is to say, because he is a limited creation, by the very definition of his existence the vessel of his brain cannot contain thoughts of the essence of G -d. As soon as he does comprehend, it is certain that this is not the essence of the Creator, abou t whom it states, “No thoughts can grasp Him, whatsoever”. Because of this his weeping is immense and is caused by his very existence. In the previous level, these tears are lacking and instead there is only a total sublimation of himself to the G -dlines s vested in the concepts which he grasps. There, his tears come about from anything which separates him from this awareness. However, on this higher level, his tears are the result of his very existence. That is, in the previous level, his grasp is of t he “something of the nothing” which is the external aspect of Chochmah . Here thou gh, his grasp is of the inner aspect of Chochmah , the “nothing of the nothing”, which only arouses absolute astonishment and sublimation. 28 See Zohar Vayera 98b 29 In other w ords, his tears come about because of his limitations and his limited existence, and he weeps over the fact that he cannot grasp the essence of G -d. These tears prove that the other side of the coin is an absolute and total pleasure in G - d’s essence. It is for this reason that he cries. According to the depth of his tears is the depth of his pleasure into the essence of G -d. They are commensurate to each other, as explained above."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" As is known , this 30 is the princip al receptacle for the aspect of insight into the secrets of the Torah. This is a s explained elsewhere regar ding the statement , “T he secrets of the Torah are only given over to a person whose heart is worried within him” 31 . However, were he to comprehend the actual Essence of the Infinite Light, then there would be a matter of joy into His (G - d’s) essence . 32 No w, although the revelation of this G -dly pleasure comes in a completely felt way 33 , nonetheless, its source is in the essential pleasure which is concealed from him 34 . It is from this [pleasure] that the opposite comes forth, which are the tears at the wond erment and separation of G -d and the la ck [of comprehension of Him], as mentioned previously. For, these two poles are also i n equal balance, literally. That is to say, according to the degree and strength of the great and immense pleasure he would have in the Essence of G -d were he to actually comprehend Him, accordingly , it’s opposite will be present , which is the deep weeping when the vessel s of his brain cannot comprehend [Him], as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding. We , there fore, find that the order of the levels of “a thing and its opposite” is as follows: [First is ] the joy and happiness from a revelation of G -dly light which is actually comprehended 35 . The o pposite which comes from it, is the weeping over the concealment or opposition to this. Higher than this , is the aspect of the concealed pleasure and joy, which is in the Koach Ma”h of Chochmah into the essence of the G -dliness which brings [everything] into being 36 . I ts   30 This refers to the worry and pain at the lack of comprehension of G - d’s essence specifically. 31 See tractate Chagigah 13a 32 As in the verse stated previously, “We will rejoice in You”, literally. 33 This refers to the tears, which result from the same power of pleasure. These tears come in a completely felt way. That is, he truly feels himself and the limitations of his existence. He feels himself to be a totally defined and limited “something”. It is specifically because he is aware of his own limited existence that he is aroused to tears. For how can a limited being cont ain and comprehend the Unlimited Being? Furthermore, the more he comprehends, the more he realizes the extent of his limitations, which arouses even greater tears because of his great pleasure in the essence of G -d, which he is incapable of comprehending. However, it is specifically this which will cause an arousal from Above, to bestow this comprehension upon him. This is as explained that the Yesh Ha’Amiti – the True Something (G -d) only dwells within the Yesh Gamur – The complete something (a person such as this ). 34 That is, the tears into the Essence of G -d are totally felt and revealed, however, its source is the pleasure into G - d’s essence which is totally concealed. 35 As explained in Kuntrus HaHitapa’alut, this is the aspect of the emotions which result from the comprehension of the external explanations, such as the order of Creation ( Seder Hishtalshelut ). Here, he comprehends with a complete grasp , the aspect of how Creation is created, and how it is conducted etc. This understanding arouses h is emotions of joy, in a revealed fashion, as explained above. When there is opposition to this revelation, he is pained, which is the opposite of the joy and comes out of it. (This is the arousal of the Neshamah level of the soul . ) 36 This is the aspect of Ma’amik in which he delves into the depths of the concept, grasping one depth after another. (This is when he grasps the Omek Hamoosag , mentioned previously.) Here, the arousal is because he senses and perceives the essence of the G -dly light which is enclothed in the general point of the concept. In other words, with the eye of his mind he perceives the essence of the G -dly light which creates the entire chaining down of the worlds. This causes a total sublimation, i.e. the investment of his entire self into this depth. This comes because of the concealed pleasure which is invested in this comprehension. Its opposite, which is born of its strength, is that he will despise his life and sense of self, and everything aside from G -d. (This is the arou sal of the Chayah level of the soul )"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"opposite power is that he despise s his own life, an d the life of anything other than G -d, as in the verse, “Who have I in the heaven s ...” Even higher than this is the aspect of the essential pleasure and joy specifically into the Essence of G -d. 37 This is like the statement, “They will rejoice in You” , literally, in a revealed way 38 . Its opposite power comes forth when the vessel s of his br ain cannot contain this. This causes him to weep . (This is like the weeping of one who is separated from someone he truly loves with his soul. For example, [regarding the love of] David and Yehonatan, [it st ates,] “He loved him as one loves his own soul”. [Therefore, when they were forced to separate ] it is wr itten, “They kissed one another and they wept ”. This [weeping] comes as a result of the strength of the abund ant lov e and great pleasure they have whe n they are together as one. There are many more examples of this .) All the above , an swers the previous matter concerning the fact that joy is in Binah and pleasure is in Chochmah 39 . Although the comprehension itsel f is into a restrained revelation ( Tzimtzum ) of G -dly light, which he [is capable of] comprehend ing , nonetheless, the source of the joy 40 reaches into the essence of G -d, specifically, just as the souls in Gan Eden literally derive pleasure from the ray of the Divine presence ( Zeev HaShechina ) 41 . [Even though] t heir comprehension too, come s in a restrained , limited fashion 42 , as is known. Th is then is the meaning of “We sha ll rejoice in You” , specifically. That is, “Joy on this side”, and it s opposite which results from its force is the “weeping” , as in the three above mentioned levels 43 . These two poles are exactly equ ally balance d, as mentioned above. This also is the meaning of the verse 44 , “[Becau se thou wouldst not serve the L -rd thy G -d] with joyfulnes s and gladness of the heart, because of the abundance of all things”, i.e. with comprehension into He who brings [everything] into being . 45 Similarly, [it will thus be 46 ] in   37 This is the arousal of the Yechidah level of the soul , and is specifically into the Essence of G -d, in how G-d Himself is. 38 That is, this is the joy into G - d’s essence from the actual revelation of Himself, as explai ned above. 39 The question asked previously was as follows: We said that joy is in Binah while pleasure is in Chochmah . However, the verse states, “We will rejoice in You”, referring to a joy into G - d’s very essence. How is this possible in the comprehen sion of Binah about which it states, “No thought shall grasp you”? 40 That is, the joy which results from his comprehension is specifically into the essence of G -d. This is evidenced by its opposite power which becomes revealed, which is the outburst of we eping from the fact that the vessel of his brain cannot contain a true grasp of G -d. 41 See tractate Brachot 17a 42 Which explains how there can be different levels of Gan Eden . 43 This is to say, as the world is now, the revelation of G -d is in a limited con strained fashion, therefore the side of these two poles which becomes revealed in him , is the weeping. This revealed side is equal to the concealed side, which is the joy into G - d’s essence. However, in the future, when G -d will be revealed, then this jo y will become revealed and the we eping will become concealed. N onetheless, they are commensurate. 44 Deuteronomy , Ki Tavo 28:47 45 The Hebrew text of this verse is, “ תחת אשר לא עבדת את ה ' אלוקיך בשמחה ובטוב לבב מרוב כל ”. The simple explanation of this verse is that it is a rebuke for not serving G -d in times of abundance. However, it can also be understood that one’s joy in serving G -d should surpass everything – Kol . The numerical value of the word Kol – כל , is 50. This refers to the 50 th gate of Binah which is the comprehension of the depth of everything in creation (the entire seder hishtalshelut ) and is the highest level of understanding. However, this verse is teaching that one’s understanding must surpass even this, and reach deeper than the depth of created existence, to understand the Creator Himself."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the future, as is written 47 , “ We will behold G -d eye to eye ” and , 48 “On that day it w ill be said, this is our G - d”, in the second person 49 . Then, [on that day] “We will rejoice and be glad in Him” specifically, as is known. This will suffice those of understanding. However, [in the state of the world as it exists] now , 50 all of this burst s forth and comes out specifically through its opposition . [Therefore, what becomes revealed is] specifically the opposite, which is the “weeping on this side”. [This is revealed] all the way to the highest levels 51 , as stated 52 , “They shall come with weep ing” , specifically 53 . Likewise it states 54 , “He who goes weeping on his way, [bearing a bag of seed, shall come back with a joyful shout, carrying his sheaves]” 55 . However, in time to come there will be laughter 56 , as stated 57 , “Then shall our mouths be fille d with laughter” , and as explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the joust [ kenigya ] 58 . This is likewise the explanation of the verse 59 , “ Thou art our father”, that 60 “ this refers to Yitzchak ”, that this Tzchok (laughter ) will come about in the future 61 .       46 That is, in the coming redemption the very essence of G -d will be openly revealed. 47 Numbers , Shlach 14:1 4 48 Isaiah 25:9 49 This word “ Zeh – this” is only used in the second person, i.e. when something is revealed and immediately perceivable. 50 This is referring to the time of exile ( Galut ), in which G - d’s essence is concealed from us... 51 Right now during exile , when the essence of G -d is concealed, what actually is revealed are limitations. These limitations are the opposite, and therefore bring forth the opposite power of the joy. That is to say, while the joy in G - d’s essence is concealed, its opposite, the tears at its concealment is revealed. Furthermore, this is true on all levels of created existence. For, all created existence is equally distant from G- d’s essence. For example, two objects, one of which is thousands of miles wide, and the other of wh ich is one millimeter wide, are both literally equal in relation to an absolutely Infinite being. 52 Jeremiah 31:8 53 However, as mentioned previously it is specifically these tears which prepare one, making him into a fitting receptacle for the actual reve lation of G - d’s essence. 54 Psalms 126:6 55 This verse also indicates how it is specifically the tears during exile over the concealment of G - d’s essence which will bring about the redemption, in which G - d’s essence will be revealed. For, as explained above , they are completely commensurate to each other. 56 i.e. Joy 57 Psalms 126:2 58 See Vayikra Rabba 13, 3. It is stated that in the future there will be a “joust” between the Shor Ha’bar – the Giant Ox, and the Leviathan, and that this joust will bring the ri ghteous much pleasure. The Shor Ha’bar will gore the Leviathon with his horns, while the leviathan will slaughter the Shor Ha’bar with its fins. It is explained that this refers to the “battle” which will take place between the animal soul and the Divine soul, i.e. the physical and the spiritual. The two will “slaughter” each other. The Hebrew word for slaughter can also mean to “uplift”. That is, the two will cause each other to be uplifted to a higher level than they are at the moment. That is, righ t now the spiritual (revelation of G -d) and the physical (concealment of G - d) are opposites and do not dwell together. Through this “battle” they will both be uplifted so that they do not contradict one another. Then, at that point, G -dliness will be rev ealed, in the physical world. This is the also the explanation of how the lights of Tohu will enter the vessels of Tikkun . 59 Isaiah 63:16 60 See tractate Shabbat 89b 61 The word Yitzchak (the name of the second forefather) means, “I will laugh” in the futur e tense. This refers to the laughter in the time of revelation which follows the tears of the time of concealment during exile. Specifically at that time, we will address Yitzchak as “our father”."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"That is , it will come out from its opposite, which is the weeping that there was during the time of exile , 62 as is known. Based on all this we may understand the true reason why the midnight prayer s of Tikkun Chatzot 63 are specifically done through tears . This is advantageous for the soul, allowing one to pray [the morning service] with a revelation of an essential pleasure [in G -d], as in the verse , “We sha ll rejoice in You” etc. and a lthough the weeping during the midnight prayer of Tikkun Chatzot are si mple tears shed over “the sins of one ’s youth” 64 and the like, nonetheless, about this it states 65 , “My tears were my bread day and night”. [“Day and night”] refers to the recital of the Shema 66 and the [ Amida ] prayers of the morning and evening 67 . This is b ecause his tears over his distance, which are caused by his sins and transgressions, rectify the aspect of the source of the sin [itself] 68 . This [source of sin] is specifically the casting off of the yoke of Heaven , 69 and the aspect of the exile of the Div ine Presence, which comes in a particular manner in each G -dly spark 70 . These tears rectify and remove the ble mish completely, and awaken above the aspect of the weeping which oppose s 71 and which come s out of its opposite power , which is the essential joy , mentioned above. This [joy] will radiate with in his G -dly soul during the Shema recital and the prayers etc. and will , literally , become as bread f or his soul 72 .   62 In other words, commensurate to the tears during the ti me of exile and concealment will be the joy during the time of redemption and revelation. They are equal. Furthermore, it is specifically the tears of exile which will bring about the joy of the redemption. Just as one who is not pained at the absence o f something does not have pleasure in its revelation, one who is not pained by the concealment of G -dliness during exile will not be joyful at the revelation of redemption. 63 This prayer bemoans the exile and the destruction of the holy temple in Jerusalem . This prayer is specifically said tearfully. It is explained that it is specifically these tears over the exile which enable one to pray the morning prayers with joy and G -dly pleasure. (The morning prayers should specifically be recited with joy.) 64 This generally refers to all sins, but more particularly to the sin of wasteful emission. However, the reason he weeps is because through his sins he separated himself from G -d and G -dly revelation, as stated, “Your transgressions are what separates you”. 65 Psalms 42:4 66 “ Hear ‘o Israel , the L -rd our G -d, the L - rd is One” 67 This is to say, the tears during the midnight prayer of Tikkun Chatzot are “my bread” during the morning and evening prayers. 68 This is also as explained elsewhere that, “One who washes his face with his tears rectifies the image of G- d which he blemished”. 69 This is to say, the source and root of all of one’s transgressions is the fact that he has essentially cast off the yoke of Heaven, (as explained in Derech Chayim , also authored by R abbi DovBer of Lubavitch ). The subsequent transgressions are only a byproduct of this underlying problem. His tears over this, and over the fact that he has totally separated himself from G -d because of his sins, and his acceptance of the yoke of Heaven upon himself, will rectify all of his sins at their source. That is, he now places upon himself the yoke of Heaven, and truly repents. 70 i.e. In each G -dly s oul 71 That is, these are the tears about his own personal limitations and separation from G -d, whi ch were mentioned above. These higher tears come out of his essential joy and pleasure in G - d’s essence. 72 The simple explanation of this is that because of his great bitterness, his tears were considered to be like bread for him, to fill his soul. In ot her words, the nature of one who is greatly pained over t he lack of the revelation of the love of his so ul, like a son towards his father or a father towards his son, is that tears of weeping are beneficial to him and act as a catharsis. These tears bring his concealed pain out into revelation, and they satiate him, like bread. The deeper explanation is that this “bread” refe rs to “the bread of Torah”, which he studies day and night . (Similarly, this includes the “the Shma recital morning and evening”, t hat is, day and night.) This is understood from the explanation of the verse, “This is my comfort"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" [O n the other hand] the casting off of the yoke of Heaven is its opposite , which is the oppos ite of tears. This is like the verse 73 , “He blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart” 74 . This is like a servant who rebels. His rebelliousness and [the fact] that he has cast off the yoke [of his Master] is the main problem and is the source of anything that he will do against the will of his master 75 . About this it states 76 , “ The foolish afflict themselves on account of their sinful ways 77 and their iniquities.” “ [Now, the iniquitous are those who are rebellious” , 78 who cast off the yoke of Heaven. Although they afflict themselves for their sins, and the sins of their you th, how will it help , 79 because , 80 “ Their so ul abhors all manner of food” [which refers to the bread] of Chochmah, as mentioned above 81 . [This is] the opposite of the pl easure which surely enlivens one’s soul 82 . The verse then continues 83 , “They reached the gates of death”, as in the verse 84 ,       in my poverty, for Your word has revived me”. The explanation i s as follows. He is comforted in his pain and anguish, which is the bitterness of his soul b ecause of his poverty. Now, “there is no poverty except the poverty in G - dly knowledge”, i.e. the know ledge and recognition of his Creator. He is lacking in this because his soul is completely empty from any G -dly light and life, like a poor person whose soul is completely empty of physical life, as is known that “the impoverished is considered like a dead person”, literally. This then is his comfort in his poverty, “for Your word has revived me”. This is to say that the words of G - d which are in the “T orah of L ight ” enliven his soul with a Divine life force, literally. For , commensurate to his anguish of the p hysical world , will be his pleasure in the words of the Torah. 73 Deuteronomy , Netzavim 29:18 74 This is to say that even after hearing the “curse” mentioned in the first part of the verse, he is defiant and insists on straying after his own heart ’ s desires, against the will of his Master. H e casts off the yoke of Heaven completely, thinking that nothing will happen to him. (The fo llowing verse con tinues, “The L -rd will not spare him, but then the anger of t he L -rd and His jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this boo k shall lie upon him, and the L -rd shall blot his name from under heaven.”) 75 This is analog ous to a slave who rebels against his master by displaying impudence and gall before him, as if he is not his master at all. In the eyes of the master, this is wor se than any transgression of a command that the slave may fail to do. This is the general r eason why the servant removes himself from the rule of the master. Although, as of yet, he may not have done so, nonetheless, his soul is prepared to cast off the yoke of his master completely , at any opportunity. Furthermore, it is this rebelliousness w hich is the foundation and underlying cause of any and all of the particular transgressions that the servant may do. 76 Psalms 107:17 77 The “sinful way”, is the casting off of the yoke of heaven, which is the path which leads to sin. One who is on this pat h will sin as a result of being on this path. Therefore, the Rebbe explains that this verse (both in our text and in Derech Chayim) is referring to this type of fool. These are people who fast and are full of remorse over individual sins, but who have no t yet rectified the foundational source of their sins, which is the casting off of the yoke of Heaven. This remorse and self affliction is, therefore, not effective in helping them. 78 See tractate Yomah 36b 79 That is, the self affliction for the particula r transgressions will not help them unless they rectify the root of the problem which is the casting off of the yoke of Heaven. 80 Psalms 107:14 81 See footnote 70. In other words, because their tears are not over the casting off of the yoke of Heaven, and they are not pained over their separation from G -d, it is clear that this is not their true desire. If it was their true desire, they would take pleasure in the toil of Torah study, for the reason mentioned above. 82 In other words, although they may regre t their sins, because their sins have become “a whip with which to smite them”, they do not truly desire to come close to G -d. They therefore do not take pleasure in the toil of Torah study, the “bread” of Chochmah , which satiates and enlivens the soul. In other words, their tears cannot be rectified through Torah study and closeness to G -d, for this is not what they are pained about. The main point is that one’s desire must be to come close to G -d, and his pain should be at his separation from G -d. Any ulterior desires will not lead one to G -d, and will not help him at all."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"“[See I have set before you this day] life and good” which is th e joy and good heartedness, from the aforementioned essential pleasure. Its opposite is “the death and evil” through casting off the heavenly yoke 85 . Now, it is specifically the tears during the midnight prayer of Tikkun Chatzot which is the foremost preparation for one ’ s soul to s tand in prayer with all of the aforementioned matters of the three of levels of “weeping from this side... etc. ” 86 [However] i f not 87 , he will delude himself in one of these ways. Either he will have weeping alone, or joy alone, or [he will have both but] the y will not be true, to their depths. This is the sign that the G -dly light has not touched his soul except from a great distance. This is like the Sod 88 of the exile of the Divine Presence in the collective souls of Israel 89 . (This , then, 90 is the main sou rce and general reason for those who constantly fall from their levels of Divine pleasure and joy, without it being established whatsoever. With the slightest resis tance and opposition the “Ropes that bind ” [him to G -d] become completely uprooted from his heart . 91 This is as mentioned above regarding the verses, “The foolish afflict themselves...Their soul abhorred all manner of food... etc. ” 92 Therefore, who ever truly desires close ness to G -d should constantly make a great preparation with in his soul during th e midnight prayer of Tikkun Chatzot, and with the aforementioned matter of “weeping is affixed in my heart on this side and joy on that side”. He sho uld not delude himself, thus literally freely destroying his soul 93 . This will suffice those of understand ing 94 .)       83 Psalms, 107:18. The entire verse is, “Their soul abhorred all manner of food; for they came near the gates of death.” 84 Deuteronomy , Netzavim 30:15. The entire verse is, “See I h ave placed before you this day the life and the good and death and evil”. 85 This is to say that a person has two options. When one casts off the yoke of Heaven, the automatic result is that he will be lead down a path to spiritual death, literally. The o pposite is true when one places the yoke of Heaven upon himself. He is then choosing the “life and good”. 86 As mentioned in the beginning of the chapter, these two aspects, the “weeping” and “joy” are interdependent. However, here the Rebbe states the pr erequisite for achieving this. That is, one must first accept upon himself the yoke of Heaven. If he has not accepted the yoke of heaven upon himself, then he will not have this love and fear during prayer. 87 That is, if he is lacking the acceptance of t he heavenly yoke, then he will either delude himself that he is “perceiving” G - dliness, or he will have only one side of the coin, without the other etc... 88 “Mystery” or “Secret” 89 In other words, during the exile G - dliness is only perceived from “afar” in an external encompassing manner. One’s faith does not permeate his being and although he does believe in G -d, it is external to his actual conduct and immediate perception. The ultimate intent is to bring these encompassing lights of G-dliness so th at they permeate one’s being, in a revealed and inner manner. 90 This lack of preparation... 91 This is to say that with the slightest opposition to his elevated spiritual level, such as involvement in his livelihood or a greater sense of self (due to receivin g honor etc.), his connection to G -d will become uprooted from his heart, and he will fall from his elevated level of awareness. This is only because of a lack in the aforementioned preparation. 92 As mentioned before, because they are lacking the acceptan ce of the yoke of Heaven, all their toil and efforts are futile, since they will surely fall and return to their previous ruined state. 93 Another explanation for the Rebbe’s usage of “freely” here can be as follows. “He should not delude himself allowing his soul to be destroyed, by freeing himself [of the yoke of Heaven]”. 94 It is therefore clear that this is a prerequisite to revelation of G -dliness and closeness to G -d. It is necessary for one to accept the yoke of Heaven, and to do this on a constant basis, specifically during the midnight prayer of Tikkun Chatzot ."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"(From all of the above we also may understand the reason for the great principle, [which was said] in the name of the Maggid of Mezritch of blessed memory. [That to] natural ly [have a dominance of the] “black gall” 95 is a preparatory receptacle to the attainment of true pleasure through self - sacrifice in “one” 96 , and for the reception of al l the secrets [of the Torah]. All this is explained in Kuntrus [ HaHitpa’alut ] at length. This will suffice those of understanding.) End of Chapter Six   95 The nature of the “black gall – Marah Shchora ” is that, by nature, one feels lowly and humble. Such people tend to be serious and studious by nature. In contrast, when the “white gall – Marah Levana ” is dominant, a person tends to be lighthearted by nature, which is the opposite of the serious, lowly person. It is explained in Derech Chayim that the nature of the “white gall” is equal to one who casts off the yoke of heaven, and that thi s is almost as bad as those who intentionally rebel against G -d ( apikorsim ). This is because, due to his lighthearted nature, he does not at all take G -d into consideration in his thoughts, speech and actions, and does not set the fear of Heaven before h is eyes. He acts in a “bubbly” gregarious manner without considering “before whom he stands”. This nature is what is c alled, “the seat of scoffers”. In contrast, one who has the nature of the “black gall” is lowly and “accepting of the yoke” by his very nature. Therefore, one who has the nature of the “black gall” is a fitting receptacle for the yoke of Heaven, and subs equently, the revelation of G -dliness. 96 This refers to the recitation of the Shma.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Seven Now, before we proceed to [explain] the detailed knowledge of the Chaining Down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ), we must precede with a matter which was mentioned previously (in chapter fo ur). This specifically refers to the connection of the particulars to th e general principle . As is known to those who delve into the Zohar and o ther authentic texts of Kabbalah, in the [study of the] Hishtalshelut and the investment of the Partzufim 1 , it is necessary for each person to know the [explanation of the Seder Hishtalshelut ] in short form. Beginning with the Simple Unity at the beginnin g of all things, until the end of all things, which is at the end of our lowly world, it all is literally bound with one “knot” 2 . This is similar to a chain which goes from beginning to end and chains down from cause to cause etc. The first light of the simple unity which is known as “the cause of all causes” 3 is also called “First” or “Preceding” 4 , as stated 5 , “I am first and I am last”. “I am first” refers to Malchut of Ain Sof (The Infinite) after the first Tzimtzum which is known as “the empty place” 6 . “I am last” at the end of everything, is the aspect of Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah , which is the source of existence of this lowly worl d. “The beginning is bound to the end and the end to the beginning” . 7 They are literally as one, like a chain whos e lowest link is bound to its   1 Partzuf literally translates as “face” or “stature”. However, this refers to the various categories of Sefirot which form a particular “stature”. For example, the sefirah of Chochmah forms the stature of Abba – father. It may have a “union” with the sefirah of Binah which forms the stature of Imma – mother. This is to say that there is a unification of these two “statures” and the “seminal” flash of insight enters into the comprehensive intellect of Binah . The reason each of them forms an entire “stature” is because each stature represents its own general “mode of conduct”, which itself contains many particulars, and may “unite” with other “statures” to produce different effects down here on earth. Although at this point, all this sounds very “m echanical”, everything will be explained and fully understood later, in the second part of the book (Chapters 10 -54). 2 This is to say, it is one continuum, like one entity. In other words, “He is the cause of all causes” and the entire chaining down of t he worlds from beginning to end, are all affected by Him, and do not act on their own, or even exist on their own. There is no interruption from beginning to end. Rather, it is like a “chain” of cause and effects, where each link is connected to the link above it. 3 See Zohar Bereshit 22b 4 This is to say, He is the first, and is the primal causer of everything which follows in the chaining down of the worlds. 5 Isaiah 44:6 6 See Etz Chaim ( Drush Igullim V’Yosher ) Shaar 1, Anaf 2 7 See Sefer Yetzirah , Ch apter 1, Mishnah 7"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"highest link 8 . This is the meaning of the verse 9 , “ See now that I, I am He”, without any change at all from beginning to end. Now, although it is known that there are a multitude of particular details in the chaining down fr om beginning to end, the entire purpose of man is the contemplation of all the particular details from beginning to end, to bind them all into one general unity with the Simple Unity, which is called “first”. This is as stated, “See now that I, I am He” , literally, and as stated 10 , “I HaShem have not change d ” . This is the pivotal point upon which the contempl ation of the particulars must be founded, so that all [the particulars] are drawn to this general principle, as previously explained. Now, the explan ation of this matter for beginners [is as follows]: The order of the multitude of [details] of the chaining down of the line and thread 11 ( Kav V’Chut ) which is drawn out after the first Tzimtzum , is known briefly as follows: At first, before the first Tzi mtzum 12 there was “ He and His Name alone” 13 . This refers to the Essence of the Unlimited One blessed be He ( Atzmoot Ein Sof ), and His light and r ay which is called “His Name” 14 . It was all in the aspect of His essence, li terally in an aspect of Infinity, an d He filled all “empty space” 15 . Afterwards, He made a Tzimtzum 16 within Himself, and there remained an aspect of an Impression ( Reshimu ) of what was withdrawn, within this “empty space”. From this impression ( Reshimu ) He drew out the line and thread ( Kav V’Chut ), in an aspect of both   8 The first way to understand this is like a chain, in the literal sense. When one shakes the top link, because the bottom link is totally bound to it through the intermediary links, it too will shake. This is to say, even the lowest l ink, our lowly world, is totally affected and controlled by G -d. Furthermore, the ultimate desire is specifically for what will come out down here, in this world. In other words, “the first” desire, and “the end” action, are equal. Everything in between only exists to facilitate what will come out at the end. The middle is therefore transparent in relation to it. For example, when two people are speaking to each other over a telephone, there are a multitude of particular intermediary processes that take place. Even without the telephone, when two people speak to each other, there are a multitude of processes which take place, as will be explained. Nonetheless, the entire chain of processes is instantaneous and transparent, and the speech at the end is literally bound with his initial intent and desire, without a single iota of change at all. A deeper explanation of this statement is that it is specifically in the “lowest link” where the revelation of “the highest link” is possible. This is to say that this chain may be compared to a “necklace”. It is specifically the last link which binds directly to the first link of the chain. Similarly, we are taught that it is specifically down here in this world where the revelation of “ Ein Od Milvado – There is nothing besides Him” is possible (see Derech Chayim), so much so, that even the soul of Moshe had to descend to this world, specifically, in order to attain this higher level of awareness. However, the main point here is the first explanation that G -d ca uses everything, from beginning to end. 9 Deuteronomy, Ha’azinu 32:39 10 Malachi 3:6 11 This will be explained later in greater detail. In general, this refers to the limited ray of revelation of the entire chaining down of the worlds. 12 Tzimtzum refers to the act of the withdrawal of revelation of the Infinite Light, i.e. the Infinite revelation of G -d. 13 Pirke D’Rabbi Elazar, Chapter 3 14 As will be explained later, a name draws out the essence of the one named. So for example, when someone calls someone b y name, it draws out the attention of his essential identity, i.e. the person himself. Furthermore, a name is a description which reveals that which it describes. Therefore, the Infinite Light, the Infinite revelation of G - d, is called “His Name”. 15 See Etz Chaim, the terminology there is “He filled all existence”. 16 He restrained the revelation of the Infinite Light and “withdrew it”."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"encompassing and pervading [lights] 17 . The Infinite Light before the withdrawal ( Tzimtzum ) is called “The upper purity” , 18 while the general encompassing light of this line ( Kav ), at its beginning , 19 is called “The lower purity” , 20 as is known. Afterwards, through a Tzimtzum (withdrawal), Malchut of the Infinite was drawn down to become Keter of Adam Kadmon. [Then,] from Malchut of Adam Kadmon there came Keter of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin . From Malchut of Arich Anpin there cam e Keter of Abba and Imma . From Malchut of Abba and Imma there came Keter of Zeir Anpin , and [likewise] from Zeir Anpin to Nukvah , until from Malchut of Atzilut there came Keter of Briyah . In this manner [there chained down] from Briyah to Yetzirah , and f rom Yetzirah to Asiyah , until the aspect of Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah , which is the end of everything. We find that the “end of everything”, which is Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah is bound with the “beginning of everything”, which is the aspect of Malch ut of the Infinite ( Ain Sof ) which contracted to become Keter of Adam Kadmon . This is as stated in the beginning of Etz Chaim 21 , in the Shaar HaKla llim , and is the meaning of “I am first, and I am last” 22 , as previously explained. (In contrast, the aspe ct of the Essence of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum cannot yet be called by the terms “beginning” or “end” since it is still an aspect of the light of His Essence as it is before being drawn down to influence below. This is as stated, “You are hol y and Your Name is holy” 23 , as is known.) Now, after [one contemplates the particulars] is the unification. Through the thorough contemplation ( Hitbonenut ) of all the particulars of the chaining down ( Hishtalshelut ), from the beginning of all things, whic h is Malchut of the Infinite until Malchut of Asiyah specifically, they should then all be drawn to the First Source, which is the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum . This is the general intent ion of the first verse of the She ma 24 recital, [which is] the “Upper Unity” 25 . [In other words, Hear ‘o Israel , the L -rd our G-d] the L - rd is One” refers to His simple unity before the first Tzimtzum . About this it states in Sefer Yetzirah 26 , “ Before One what can you count?” [This is to s ay, G -d is] higher   17 This refers to Igullim and Yosher , which will be explained later. 18 Tihiru Ila’ah – The Upper Purity 19 This limited ban d of revelation is drawn from the Reshimu – Impression, at its beginning and ends down here at our lowly world ( Olam HaShafel ). Therefore, only its beginning, which is the general encompassing light of the entire chaining down of all the worlds, is called the “lower purity”. 20 Tihiru Tata’a – The Lower Purity 21 Etz Chaim – The Tree of Life, from the Holy Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (the Arizal). 22 This is to say, “I am first” with the first Tzimtzum of Malchut of Ain Sof , and “I am last” with the last Tzimtzum of Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah . In other words, what will come out in the end action is according to what came up in the beginning desire, and I am the cause of it all. 23 This is to say, He is Holy and removed from Creation, and His Name, the Infinite Ligh t, is Holy and removed from Creation. 24 Deuteronomy, V’Etchanan 6:4 25 See Zohar Bereshit 18b. The first verse of the Shema is the “Upper Unity”, while the second statement of the prayer is the “Lower Unity”. 26 See Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"than the ten sefirot 27 . This is as state d 28 , “You are One but not in enumeration 29 ” of the ten sefirot , as is known. How ever , the general intent of “Blessed be the glorious name of His kingship forever” 30 , which is the “lower unity” 31 , is th e aspect of Malchut of the Infinite after the Tzimtzum . About this it states 32 , “ Your kingdom is the kingdom of all the worlds”, until Malchut (Kingdom) of Asiyah . This is the aforementioned matter of “I am first and I am last”. Now, this entire unificat ion and “binding” from the beginning to the end, which follows the contemplation of the multitude of intermediary particulars, is only like a single detail in comparison to the general principle which includes them all 33 . This general principle is the asp ect of the general encompassing of the Circle ( Igul ) which encompasses the Line ( Kav ) 34 . [M ore over,] it too is considered to only be a detail in comparison to the Essence of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum , 35 which is called the “Upper Purity”. [This “Upper   27 The original Hebrew of the Sefer Yetzirah is “ Lifnei Echad mah attah sopher? ” The word “ sopher ” shares the same etymological root as the “ sefirot ”. Furthermore, it means “to count”. The indication of this Mishnah is that the Infinite Light of G -d before the Tzimtzum , is “one, but not in a way of enumeration”, since it is higher than being a “first” to a “second”. Furthermore, we learn that it is higher than the ten sefirot and is not made up of them. That is to say, He has no beginning or end. 28 See I ntroduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a 29 This is to say, he is One, but not a numerical one. This again signifies that G -d is beyond the enumeration of the ten sefirot , and is absolutely singular. He creates them, but is beyond them, and cannot be counted by them or amongst them. Let us return to the originally quoted verse of the Shema , “Hear ‘o Israel...the L - rd is One”. What has been brought out of this verse is not just that there is “only one G - d” as opposed to two etc, but rather, that only G -d exists. He is an absolute, singular being. In other words, this “one” is not a numerical “1”, but rather signifies G - d’s absolute singularity. 30 In the daily Shema prayer, this is the statement which immediately follows the first statement of “Hear ‘o Israel”. 31 See tractate Psachim 56a, and Zohar Bereshit 18b 32 Psalms 145:13, “ Malchutcha Malchut Kol Olamim ”. The literal translation is “Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom”. However, it can also be translated as, “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all the worlds ”. ( Malchut is Kingdom ). This signifies how G -d not only brings all worlds into existence, but that He is the ruler of them all. 33 In other words, the entire chaining down of a particular line of revelation is literally as nothing in comparison to the g eneral encompassing power which includes the entire chaining down within it. This may be understood through the following analogy of a human being who desires a dwelling place. This desire for a dwelling place includes every kind of dwelling place within it. The revelation of a particular desire for a “brick house” is literally like nothing compared to the potential of the original desire for a dwelling place, and is only a particular of this general desire. Furthermore, the particular desires for the brick house, such as a kitchen and a bedroom are only particulars of the general desire for the brick house. Furthermore, the desire for a sink in the kitchen is only a particular of the general desire for the kitchen, which is a particular desire of the g eneral desire for the house, which is a particular desire of the general desire for the dwelling place. Furthermore, even the entire desire for a dwelling place is only a glimmer of revelation of this person’s capacity for desire. Likewise, the revelatio n and actualization of our lowly world is only like the most particular detail of revelation of inherent potential of the lowest order of angels of the lowest world of Asiyah . Furthermore, the lowest order of angels of the world of Asiyah is similarly, only the most finite fraction of revelation of the potential of the world above them etc. This continues to the point where the entire chaining down, of all of the worlds, are all only a limited ray of revelation and are literally not even a detail in compa rison to the potential of G - d’s Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum . Nonetheless, the original desire and intent is seen down here in this lowly world, specifically, because “the end is bound with the beginning”, as will be explained. 34 This is the general encompassing light, which encompasses the entire band of limited revelation. These two aspects, Igullim – Circles and the Kav Yashar – the Straight Line, will be explained later at great length. 35 See footnote 33."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Purity”] is even higher than being an aspect of a “general principle” for “particular details”, since we have already stated that “He is Holy” and removed in the aspect of His Essence 36 . This is the explanation of the statement 37 , “the Singular One, Life of the world. ” From this aspect of “ Yachid – Singular”, [influence] is drawn down by means of the aforementioned first Tzimtzum, to become what is called “the life of the worlds” of ABY”A, 38 which are within the Kav 39 in an encompassing and pervading manner, as is known. This will suffice those of understanding. It is necessary for a person to know and implant in his soul all the explanations of the chaining down of the worlds . A fter the explanations of all the particular details in th e order of the chaining down ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) have been explained to a person, then he should constantly accustom himse lf throughout his life [to contemplate them ] in his mind and heart , so that he will be proficient in all the details , specifically. [Through this ,] he will [be capable of] making a summation of the entire length, including [the entirety of it ] from beginning to end as one . This [should be done] to such a degree that in a single moment of contemplation within his soul, [when he contemplates] “the e nd of everything”, which is the comprehension of physical creation of “something out of nothing”, [i.e. the creation] of the physical planets and the four physical foundations, and all the other particulars of this lowly world , [he will see that there rest s upon them the aspect of Malchut of the Infinite, literally] 40 . This is as stated 41 , “ Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these”. “Lift up your eyes on high” with an actual physical sight, “and behold who has created these” into a compl etely physical something, through the most final Tzimtzum concealment. It is literally in this [“end of everything”] where Malchut of the Infinite which is the “beginning of everything”, and is even higher than the source of Atzilut , [it is specifically here that it ] rests , in an infinite aspect, specifically 42 . For this reason the book of Psalms only mentions the greatness of G -d in a simple manner, [as it is pertinent to] the greatness and wondrousness of the acts of G -d in the [physical] heavens and the earth, and its physical hosts , specifically. It makes no menti on or praise of His greatness [as it is pertinent to] the upper spiritual worlds and the highest heights which   36 This is to say, the Essence of the Inf inite Light before Tzimtzum can in no way be considered a “general principle” which includes “particular parts and details”, since then He would not be an absolute Infinite Singularity. Rather, we have already stated that he is “Holy” and removed from the entire Creation, since creation is a limited finite band of revelation, while He is an absolutely Infinite Singularity. Since He is not a composite being, like any created entities, this cannot be considered a “general principle” that includes “particula rs”. Rather, He is an absolutely simple singularity. This will be explained in greater detail in chapter 10. 37 See the Baruch She’amar and Yishtabach prayers of the morning prayers, “ Yachid Chay HaOlamim ” 38 This is an acronym for the worlds Atzilut, Bri yah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. 39 This is the general finite line of revelation. 40 In other words, when he looks around at existence, he will immediately recognize that he is being brought into existence at every moment by G -d Himself. The entire chaining down of the worlds will become transparent to him. As in the example given previously with the telephone, although there are a multitude of intermediaries between one person and the other, nonetheless, they are talking to each other, essence to essence, litera lly. Furthermore, although there are a multitude of intermediaries, the intermediaries are totally transparent to them. 41 Isaiah 40:26 42 This is to say that one is then capable of “gazing heavenward” and immediately recognizing how all of Creation is lite rally an act of the Infinite G -d. Moreover, he recognizes this immediately."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"precede even the world of Atzilut . This is because, as previously mention ed, “th e beginning is specifically bound to the end . ” This is [also ] as stated, “See now that I, I am He” 43 , and that the Essence of the Infinite Light is what encompasses [all of ex istence]. This will suffice for those of understanding. This , then , is the true intent in the contemplation of the particulars , as previously explained 44 . (Even though according to the calculation of the [multitude of] details in the chaining down of the worlds, there is a very vast distance between the beginning and the end, nonethe less, in truth , it is very c lose, without any interrupti on and concealment in between . This is as stated, “See now that I, I am He” and 45 “There is no other besides me as an intermediary”. This will suffice for those of understanding.) (This is likewise as stated 46 , “ [Lo, this only I have found,] that G -d has made man upright; but they have sought out many calculations ”. “That G -d has made ma n upright” [refers to the] Primordia l Man ( Adam Kadmon ), from the beginning of the line ( Kav ) until the “heel” of the Prim ordi al Man ( Adam Kadmon ), which concludes at the end of the world of Asiyah 47 . It is all one complete [matter] from beginning to end. [However,] “They have sought out many calculations ” [referring to] the aspect of Circles ( Igullim ), with separation s and division s, one above the other 48 .) All of the above may be understoo d, in a very brief way , from the aspect of the Ketarim 49 of each world. In the aspect of the Ketarim there is no aspect of “chaining down” from cause to effect in a way of distance in level s, at all 50 . For example, the aspect of the simple desire in the Essence of the Infinite Light, as stated 51 , “When it arose in His simple desire”, that is, the aspect of Malchut of the Infinite itself is what arose in his simple thought , [as in the   43 This is to say, “I am He with the first Tzimtzum , and I am He with the last Tzimtzum ” . 44 As explained in chapter four, the particular contemplation of the details should always be brought back to this general intent. 45 See Tikkunei Zohar 120a 46 Kohelet 7:29 47 This refers to the aspect of Yosher – Straight Line, and Tikkun – Rectification, which will be explained later. This is to say, it is one continuum from beginning to end, w ithout any interruption or cessation. 48 As opposed to the aspect of Yosher and Tikkun in which all the sefirot are included one with the other and are bound to one another from beginning to end, the aspect of Igullim is like concentric circles, in which on e is a bove the other, and they are dis connected. This leads to the aspect of Tohu – Chaos, where there is division and separation as opposed to a unified system. All this will be explained later in great detail . 49 This word is the plural of Keter . Th e sefirah of Keter corresponds to the faculty of “pleasure” and “desire”, as will be explained at great length later. 50 That is to say, there is no distance from the Essence of G -d in the sefirah of Keter. In this, the sefirah of Keter is different than a ll the other sefirot . This can be understood by analogy from the desires of human beings. This is to say that all desires that a person has is because he desires them in his essence. If he would not desire them in his essence, then they would not arise at all into his thoughts, emotions or actions etc. Furthermore, the final action is what arises in his desire first. This is, likewise, the case in the aspect of the Ketarim of everything in existence, as will be explained. In contrast, in the aspect of “cause and effect” there is a distance between the cause and the effect, in that the effect can never grasp its cause, as is known. 51 See introduction of Etz Chaim, and Shaar 1, Anaf 2"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"st atement] “I sha ll rule”, 52 which is much higher than the desire to Emanate ( Atzilut ) or to Create ( Briyah ) etc. Those [desires] are still only an aspect of a Heyuli e 53 . From this first [simple desire] , there is a Tzimtzum – lessening to the “Primal Desire” , which is called Keter of Adam Kadmon 54 . Afterwards, [there came] the desire to Emanate which in general is the aspect of Keter of Atzilut . Afterwards was the desire to Create, which is Keter of Malchut of Briyah 55 , following which [there came] Keter of Malchut of Yetzirah , 56 until the aspect of Keter Malchut of Asiyah , which is the desire to actualize. This is as stated 57 , “ Whatever HaShem desires he did ...” [Similarly,] below in man, what difference is there between the aspect of his desire and essential heyulie in which there were included four desires. For example, the desire for his essential self and his most final desire to actualize, all came from and are rooted in one source 58 . Likewise, there is no difference between His [G - d’s] simple desire which was drawn down to become the desire for emanation, and His simple desire which was drawn down to become [t he aspect of] “Whatever HaShem desires he did ” at the end of our world of action. This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Seve n   52 As stated in the Zohar on “ VaYimloch ”. These words, “I will rule – Ana Emloch ” is the original simple desire which arose in His simple thought. 53 See chapter 2, footnote 17 54 This is the desire for Adam Kadmon – Primal Man, which will be explained later. 55 Keter – corresponds to desire, while Malchut corresponds to action . This then is the desire to actualize the world of Creation - Briyah . 56 This is the desire to actualize the world of Formation - Yetzirah . 57 Psalms 135:6 58 This is to say, his innermost desires and outermost desires are all rooted in his very essence, an d there is no difference between them. Likewise, G - d’s highest desire for emanation etc, and the lowest desire for actualization of this physical world are literally equal."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Eight Now, ju st as in the aspect of Keter , there is a unification of all the particula rs to the general principle, reaching, literally, all the way to the aspect of the simple desire [as it is] in the Essence of the Inf inite Light, in this same way, a person may contemplate the aspect of the Chochmah of each world, from beginning to end 1 . This then is the meaning of what is written 2 , “ Bereshit Barah – In the beginning (G -d) created etc”. “ Bereshit ” is translated by Targum Yonatan as “ B’C hochmeta - with W isdom”. Onkelos translates it as “ BeK admin – Primordially”. This is the aspect of Ket er, which is called Kadmon – Primordial, since it is the aspect of the essence as it precedes Chochmah . This is because 3 , “Wisdom is found from “nothing” but it [itse lf] is not an actual “nothing” , which is not the case in regard to d esire 4 . 5 However, ju st as desire is [brought about] from the Essence by means of Tzimtzum , until it [finally] becomes invested in action , thus fulfill ing the above mentioned verse, “Whatever HaShem desires He did”, so is it with the aspect of Chochmah . [In other words, Choch mah too is brought about] by means of Tzimtzum from the Essence. [The Essential Chochmah ] is what is called “the Primal Chochmah ” or “the Simple Chochmah ” as it exists within [G - d’s] Simple Unity. From there it is drawn down into each particular world of ABY”A , until [it reaches] the aspect of Chochmah of Malchut of Malchut of the world of Asiyah 6 . About this [last level] it states 7 , “ In wisdom hast thou made them all”. For, just as it   1 This is to say that in the previous chapter the Rebbe displayed the chaining down of the aspect of Keter and explained how it is literally bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light. This type of contemplation can be done in regard to all the other particulars, such as the Chochmah or Binah of each world etc. This means that a person can trace back the wisdom which there is in this world to see how it is literally bound with G - d’s wisdom, blessed be He. 2 Genesis 1:1 3 Job 28:12. The Hebrew reads, “ VeHaChochmah M’Ayin Timatze ”. The literal translation of this is “But where shall wisdom be found?” However, this can also be understood to mean, “ Chochmah is found from Ayin – “nothingness”. If it is “found” from noth ingness, it itself cannot be true “nothingness”. 4 This is to say that while Chochmah – Wisdom (insight) is only found from “nothing”, it is not nothing itself. However, Keter, which corresponds to the faculty of desire is actually “nothing”, and is the “nothing” from which Chochmah is found, as explained in chapter one. 5 The Rebbe will now begin to explain the relevance of these words. This is to say that just as “He created with desire”, He also “created with wisdom”, all the way to the final action. 6 This is to say that in the same manner as the chaining down of Malchut or of Keter, as mentioned in the previous chapter , there is also a chaining down of Chochmah , from the “beginning of everything” until “the end of everything” at the end of the world o f Asiyah ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"states “ Bereshit ”, that “He created” with wisdom, 8 in the same way , he likewise “formed” and “actualized” with wisdom 9 . This is similar to how it is that the desire to create, form, and actualize are all [rooted] in a single [primary] desire 10 . However , it chained down from the world of Creation to the world of Formation , and from the world of formation to the world of Actualization, with a lowering of levels from cause to effect 11 . For example, from Malchut of Keter of the world of Briyah there came Keter of the world of Yetzirah . Likewise, H e created, formed and actual ized [everything] with as single wisdom. However, [here too, in regard to Chochmah ] it chained down from Briyah to Yetzirah etc. In other words, from the aspect of Malchut of Chochmah of Briyah [influence] is drawn down to Chochmah of Malchut of Yetzirah . Likewise, in this manner [influence chains down] from Yetzirah to Asiyah , until [it reaches] the aspect of Chochmah of Malchut of Asiyah about which it states, “In wisdom hast thou made them all”. Similarly, it states 12 , “HaShem by wisdom founded the ea rth”, and other such verses. (More particularly the chaining down is that Keter of Yetzirah comes from the aspect of Malchut of Malchut of Briyah , and Chochmah of Yetzirah comes from Malchut of Keter of Yetzirah . Nevertheless, generally, all aspects of c ause and effect from one world to the next are drawn one from the other without being diminished by the multitude of intermediaries which are between them. For example it states 13 , “And HaShem gave Shlomo wisdom”. [Now, Shlomo] was in the world of Asiyah . This influence was drawn down from Chochmah [as it exists] in the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ), to Chochmah of Adam Kadmon . From Chochmah of Adam Kadmon [it wa s drawn down] to the Concealed Chochmah 14 of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin . From t here [it descended] to become the light of Abba 15 of Atzilut . [From there it descended ] until [it reached] the aspect of Chochmah of Malchut of Atzilut . From there [it descended further] to Chochmah of Malchut of Briyah . In this manner it [descended] fro m Briyah to Yetzirah , and from Yetzirah to Asiyah , until from Chochmah of Malchut of Asiyah this light and influence of G -dly wisdom entered the soul of Shlomo 16 . [This was] likewise [the case], in the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the Temple. There radiated from Keter and Chochmah of the Essence [of the Infinite Light] until [it reached] the       7 Psalms 104:24 8 As per Targum Yonatan, mentioned above. 9 This refers the the three worlds of Briyah – Creation, Yetzirah – Formation and Asiyah – Actualization. Just as we learn out of the first verse of the Torah, that “with wisdom He create d”, so too, with wisdom he “formed” and “actualized”. 10 See the end of chapter 7. 11 This can be understood through the analogy of one who desires something to eat. Included in this desire is his desire to take his wallet, his desire to get into his car, a nd his desire to go to the store and purchase food. All these subsequent desires are included in his original desire to eat and do not exist independently of it. If, as he is about to leave his house to go to the store, his friend brings over some food, all the subsequent desires which “chained down” from the original desire dissipate. Moreover, it is he himself who desires all of them, equally. 12 Proverbs 3:19 13 Kings I, 5:26 14 Chochmah Stima’a – The Concealed Wisdom of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin , as wi ll later be explained. 15 Abba – Father, refers to Chochmah of Atzilut as will later be explained. 16 This applies not only to Shlomo , but to everyone."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"aspect of Keter and Chochmah of the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the world of Asiyah – Actualization. [This is to say that ] the spiritual [light] of Keter an d Chochmah of Asiyah rested upon the physical Tablets and the Holy Ark, which stood in the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the physical Temple below. (Similarly, [in our daily prayers] we request 17 , “ You grace man with knowledge” and , “Grace us from You ” , specifically 18 . This will suffice for those of understanding.) (By way of example this may be understood from human beings below. For instance, a person’s essential Heyulie wisdom includes [within itself] all that spreads forth and branches out of the l ight of his wisdom, even co mpletely outs ide of his essence, i.e. even [to the point of] intellect that is invested in a physical act, which is separate [from his essence] . For him there is no difference between the spreading of his essential insight ( Choch mah ) within the essence of his intellect, in which he conceptualizes [in a way of] intellectual analysis, and the spreading forth [of the intellect] into a [physical] act which is separate [and apart from his essence]. 19 It is all considered to be a single insight 20 , except that this [level] is more spiritual and essential to him, while in action it [the wisdom ] becomes [in vested] in to a separate thing. This is so much so , that in relation to the aspect of his actual essence it is but a single wisdom, excep t that it spreads forth from his intellectual analysis into his emotions and thoughts, until, ultimately, he actually puts this insight into action. An example of this is [when someone has] an [innovative] insight in business matters etc. 21 Similarly, [thi s may be understood] in regard to the speech [of G - d], as in the verse, “And G- d said, let there be light” which then came into action , as in the verse , “ And there was light”. Of course, this originated from the aspect of His Essential Wisdom as it is in the essence of the Emanator. [This is to say,] that He e manated ( Atzilut ) the light, and afterwards he c reated ( Briyah ), f ormed ( Yetzirah ) and made ( Asiyah ). This is likewise the case   17 See the beginning of the Amida prayer. 18 This is to say, from the Essence of G -d, specifically. In othe r words, when we pray, our prayers should be directed to the Essence of G -d Himself. Since, as we see from the examples of various particular chaining downs, everything comes from Him. He is “the Cause of all Causes”. 19 For example, the intellectual thou ght process and conceptualization for the theory of an automobile, and the actual building of the automobile. These two are the same to him, and are both called “his wisdom”. Furthermore, if when he builds the automobile it is flawed and does not functio n properly, there is certainly a flaw in the wisdom in his head as well. For, they are really the same exact thing. Only, at first it is expressed in his intellect and afterwards it is expressed in his action, but they are the same. 20 See the previous an d following footnotes. 21 For example, a person will have an inspiration flash of innovative insight in business. He will then analyze it and contemplate all of its advantages or disadvantages etc. Then, when he thinks about how great a plan it is, his em otions will become aroused by it, and he will become excited. Then, he actually implements the plan and brings it into actuality. All of these are just different expressions of the same wisdom. First it is revealed and expressed into his intellect, then into the emotions and thoughts of his heart, and finally into action, but they are all one and the same thing. The end is in no way disconnected from its beginning, and it did not diminish along the way. This is more clearly understood from the followin g: If someone were to say, “I know someone who is a genius in chess”, we obviously expect this person to be capable of playing chess. In other words, if he is a genius in this subject intellectually, certainly, in his actions as well, he must be a genius in it. Moreover, the reason we expect him to be able to play chess is because the original desire and intellect and the final action, are not two different things. If he says “I am a genius in chess, but I cannot play chess”, then there is certainly a f law to his “genius”, and he is not the “genius” he believes himself to be."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"in regard to all the specifics of the coming into being of the emanat ed, created, formed and actualized, from th e Essence of Ein Sof . All the particulars of thes e [worlds] are unified and bound with the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), which is [vested] in ABY”A . Moreover, from [the perspective of] His essence, there is absolutely no difference between the first and the last. This being the case, the statement , “I am f irst and I am last” likewise applies to the aspect of Chochmah at the beginning of the e manation – Atzilut, until Chochmah at the end of the Actualization - Asiyah . Furthermore, in this way , the aspect of the general unification of the emotions, thought, speech and action of each of the four worlds of ABY”A , may also be unde rstood in a particular manner. [This is to say] that the emotions 22 of Atzilut become invested within the emotions of Briyah , and the emotions of Briyah become invested within the emotions of Yetzirah . The emotions of Yetzirah [then] become invested within the emotions of Asiyah, so that ultimately the six directions 23 of Asiyah are bound up wit h the beginning of everything, i.e. with His [G - d’s] Essent ial emotions, which precede the world of Atzilut . 24 About these [emotions] it states 25 , “[The King who is exalted and alone,] who is exalted above the days of the world” 26 . T his refers to the aspect of the seven lower sefirot of Atik Yomin , [which receive] from the seven lower sefirot of Adam Kadmon , [which receive] from the emotions of the Infinite Light itself, which are concealed within His Essential Self, literally. An ex ample [of the above] is the aspect of Chessed – Kindness of the Infinite Light. About this [Kindness] it states 27 , “ HaShem ’s kindness es have not ceased”, since it, literally , is in an aspect of Limitlessness. [Regarding this Kindness ] we say 28 , “Let Your K indness...be upon us” , literally. [This is to say that it should radiate] w ithin the kindness of the diminished emotions of Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah , which radiates in this world. Likewise, from the aspect of His essential thought, [influence] is drawn down until [it reaches] the aspect of the thoughts of Malchut of Asiyah , in that He thinks to do it , in actu ality. The same [principle] applies to speech and action, because j ust as “everything that   22 The emotions refers to the six emotive attributes ( sefirot ) of Chessed – Kindness, Gevurah – Might, Tiferet – Mercy, Netzach – Conquest, Hod – Majesty, Yesod – Foundation. 23 This refers to the six emotional sefirot , and will later be explained. 24 For example, when a person sees a poor child who looks like he hasn’t eaten a square meal for a while, this will arouse emotions of pity and sympathy in him. The arousal of pity towards someone outside of himself is because, in essence, he is a merciful person. Now, although this appears instantaneous, there is an entire process involving a multitude of particulars. Nonetheless, all of the particulars, thoughout, are literally bound up with his essential mercifulness, and are only aroused because of it. If the essential mercifulness would be lacking, then the external emotions or actions which come out of it would not be. It is a direct chain, and essentially, from his perspective, the y are all the same. Furthermore, there is no diminishment throughout the entire chaining down. In other words, the emotions of his heart are exactly like the emotions of his brain, which are exactly like the emotions of his desire, which are exactly like the emotions of his essence. If in his essence the emotion of mercy is aroused, similarly, his desire will be aroused to mercy, his intellect will think in merciful terms, and his emotions will be aroused with sympathy and mercy, and he will speak words of mercy and act with mercy. 25 See the morning prayers, blessing of Yotzer . 26 That is, the seven lower sefirot (the emotions) are called “days” (as in the seven days of the week). These emotional sefirot transcend the “days” (emotions) of the worlds of AB Y”A . 27 Lamentations 3:22 28 Psalms 33:22, and Shabbat Prayers"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the HaShem d esires” in His Essential desire, “He does”, so too, “everything that HaShem de sires” [to think], He thinks. [The] o nly [difference between this and the desire as it exists in His essence is] that it descends and is drawn into the [order of the] chaining down [of the worlds from cause to effect] un til His desire, intellect and thought is to actually do . However, [t he entire chaining down process ] of the desire, intellect, emotions, thought and action are all considered to, literally , be one [thing] relative to the aspect of His actual Essence 29 . Th is is understood from all the above, and will suffice for those of understanding. Now , after [contemplating] all this , a person should conceptualize and contemplate “Who created these” , physically , how it is that even the last particular is not separate f rom the first general source 30 . [He should contemplate this in regard to] each particular of Creation, such as the creation of heavens and the earth, or all the particulars in the categories of Inanimate, Vegetati on, Animal, and Speaking Beings. [H e should contemplat e] how their spiritual source in Malchut of Asiyah is bound up and connected to the highest heights , like a chain 31 . This is so, j ust as the aspects of Keter and Chochmah of ABY”A are unified [with their source], as stated, “In the beginning He c reated” [which was translated as] “Primordially – Keter 32 ” , and, “With Wisdom – Chochmah ” . S o too , with the particulars which branch out from them, i.e. the emotions, thought, speech and action of each world . 33 [This continues ] until the aspect of Action – Asiyah of Malchut of the world of Asiyah. The end [of everything] is bound with the beginning of everything. For, just as He emanated with Kadmon (Desire), so too, with this very same Kadmon (Desire) H e created, formed and made 34 .   29 In other words, the entire of Seder Hishtalshelut is like one line of action or expression. This means that the multitudes of particulars are considered to be a single expression which include s them all. Although they are expressed in a continuum, nonetheless, the source of them all, equally, is from the essence of G -d. 30 An example of this kind of understanding can be seen when a person throws a stone through a window. We do not say that the stone broke the window, because, really, it was his hand which threw the stone. However, we do not say that his hand broke the window, because his hand is connected to his heart etc. We do not say his heart broke the window, because his heart only recei ves from his head, and is totally connected to it. Furthermore, we don’t even say his head broke the window, because his head is connected to his desire. Likewise, we cannot say that his desire broke the window, for his desire does not exist independent of him. Rather, we immediately say that he broke the window. Although there is this complete chaining down, even into a totally separate entity, such as a stone, nonetheless, it is all totally bound to the essence of the thrower of the stone. This is wh y we require him to rectify the wrong, rather than the stone to rectify it. 31 That is, he should contemplate how each particular creation is literally bound up with the Creator. This is called a “ Yichud – Unification”. 32 Desire 33 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (This is the general inclusion of the ten sefirot of each world. That is, Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin, Abba and Imma , Zeir Anpin and Nukvah of [each of] the four worlds of ABY”A .) 34 Allegorically, this can be understood by one who desires to build a home . First he has the general desire for the kind of home he would like. Then he contemplates and analyzes all the particulars which he desires. Then he “forms” the blue print. Then he builds the actual house. Even though there is a chaining down from ca use to effect, and to an outsider they may appear as separate things, they are literally all part and parcel of one desire. Furthermore, the final desire to actually build the home and dwell in it, is greater than all the desires which preceded it while i t was still in the thought and planning stage etc."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Likewise, the emotions, the six directions, are sublimated [to G - d], as in “Behold, the place is with M e” . 35 [For example,] “Yours, G -d, is the greatness” [represents the sublimation of Chessed ] in each world, according to what it is. [This continues upward] until the aspect of His Essential Space. This is called “His Place”, as in the dictum of the Sages 36 , “H e is the place of the world but the world is not His place”. This is similar to the well known adage 37 , “He grasps all worlds, but there are none who grasp Him”. Even the Primal Thought and Desire 38 [cannot grasp Him]. From a ll this, the matter of the unification and connection of the particulars to the general principle by way of the totality of everything in the essence of the Infinite light [a s it is drawn down] into AB Y’’A, may be understood. This is besides the aspect of the unity [as it relates to] each world, in a particular way, in regard to the ten Sefirot [of each world] . Now, although a person may know the explanations for the entire chaining down of ABY”A [with all its] specifics , he should [nonetheless] draw his soul to [contemplate and] unify the particulars to the general totality, in the aforementioned manner, unt il [they are] literally [one ] with the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ). This is asid e from [his contemplation in] unifying and sublimating each particular world to the Essence. [He should do this] until his vast contemplation in the particulars of this matter become en capsulated in a wondrously brief summary 39 . An example of this [can be understood from the verse ] 40 “ Your kingdom is the k ingdom of all the worlds”. This is the aspect of Malchut of Ein Sof [as it is in vested] within Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah , as previously exp lained regarding the Desire, Wisdom and Emotions. This is in accordance with the verse, “See now that I, I am He”, literally. Similarly, [regarding the verse 41 ,] “I HaShem have not change d”. “I – Ani ” , which is the aspect of Malchut , is the [same] “nothingness” as 42 Keter , since “the beginning is bound up with the end”. [This is true] both particularly in each particular world, and in the general totality of everything. For this reason it states, “I HaShem have not change d ”. [That is, there is no difference] whatsoever between Malchut of the Infinite, and Malchut of Asiyah . This , then , is the meaning of, “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all the worlds”, i.e. even   35 The six emotional sefirot correspond to the six directions. Chessed corresponds to South, Gevurah to North, Tiferet – East, Netzach – Up, Hod – Down, - Yesod – West. They therefore represent the aspect of place or space. 36 See Bereshit Rabba, chapter 68, 9. 37 See Zohar (Raya Mehemnah) Pinchas 225a 38 In Hebrew this is Machshava V’Ratzon HaKadoom . This aspect will be explained later, in chapters 17 and 18. 39 That is, just as in the previously mentioned ex ample of a person who throws a stone (footnote 29) we immediately recognize that it is he who threw the stone. We immediately see the entire chaining down of the act of throwing a stone through the window, from beginning to end, as one thing. It is total ly bound with the thrower of the stone, without any cessation or separation at all. It is his act, and only he is culpable. Similarly, when one thoroughly grasps the Seder Hishtalshelut – The Chaining down of the worlds, he must grasp it to the point wher e he sees the entire matter as one act, from beginning to end, immediately. That is, he sees how G -d Himself is literally acting, down here in this world. 40 Psalms 145:13 41 Malachi 3:6 42 This is to say that relative to G - d’s Essence, both the desire and the action are literally the same. There is absolutely no difference between them. Just as it is He who desires, it is He who actualizes. (We previously explained that Keter is the aspect of “ Ain – nothingness”.) Furthermore, the final action (of what comes out in this world) and the original desire are literally the same. What G -d desires He does, in actuality."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"until Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah . [It is all] because of the reason explained above 43 . This will suffice for those of understanding 44 .     43 This is to say that a King is as much a King in his capital as he is at most remote the borders of his kingdom. Moreover, the real display o f his Kingship is at his borders. For this reason the Megilah of Esther does not say that Achashverosh was the King in Shushan, which was the capital. Rather it says, “He was the King from Hodu to Kush” which were the furthest reaches of his kingdom, at the borders. If He desires to enlarge his kingdom, he makes his borders bigger, through conquest etc. 44 In summary and conclusion of this chapter: The point of all of the above, and the point of the knowledge of the chaining down of the worlds, is to recognize and be aware that everything that occurs, even down here in this physical world, is literally an act of G -d Himself. For example, we previously mentioned a verse, “Yours, G - d is the greatness”, which refers to Chessed . This does not just repres ent an abstraction of some kind of “spiritual” kindness, but rather is stating that ALL kindnesses that occur are themselves G - d’s Infinite kindness, since they cannot exist independently of Him. Therefore, when a person is having an emotion of kindness, it is literally G - d’s own kindness being expressed through the vehicle of this person. The person’s kindness cannot exist otherwise. This is true in the opposite sense as well, as in, “Yours, G -d, is the might”, which represents the attribute of Gevurah . All acts of Gevurah – Might (which includes even evil acts, as will shortly be explained), are literally acts of G -d Himself, and cannot exist independently of Him. To return to the analogy above, with the thrown stone, we see an entire process of chain ing down. That is, first he desire’s to throw the stone, then he thinks about it, has heartfelt emotions, then gut emotions, and then is moved to act. Then the act affects a separate object, the stone, which is propelled through the air until it hits and breaks the window. This entire chaining down from cause to effect is one continuum, which is totally bound with the essence of the thrower. This matter may be applied to the Seder Hishtalshelut as well. The desire is in Atzilut , the thoughts about it ar e in Briyah , the emotions in Yetzirah, and the actions in Asiyah , and, finally, even in a separate thing like the “stone” which corresponds to the Kelipot . There is a direct chaining down from beginning to end, and G - d Himself is the one who “threw the st one”, so to speak. One may then ask, “Do we have free choice?” The answer to this can be understood from the Talmudic story of Caesar Nero. Caesar Nero set out to attack Jerusalem. As he approached he shot an arrow to the east (away from Jerusalem) and i t fell in Jerusalem. He then shot one to the west, and it fell in Jerusalem. He shot an arrow in each of the four directions and each one fell in Jerusalem. He then asked a young boy, “What verse did you learn today?” The boy replied, “I shall take my reve nge against Edom (Rome) through the agency of my people Israel.” (Ezekiel 25:14) Nero said to himself, “The Holy One, blessed be He, wants to destroy His house, and He wants to wipe His hands on that man ”, (referring to himself) . He ran away and converted to Judaism and Rabbi Meir was his descendant. As is clearly understood from this story, G -d Himself is the perpetrator of all actions. However, from this story we also see that our free choice lies in what we choose to be a vehicle for. When we choose to fulfill the desires of G -d by fulfilling His commandments, G -d Himself is actually fulfilling the commandments and His desire. When we choose to violate His commandments, we are literally dragging G -d into violating the commandments, as i t says in Tanya, that it is as if we grab the king’s head and force it into vile refuse. In other words, by transgressing His commandments we force G -d to act in a way which is against His will. Now, we are capable of this is only because He allows us be. However, ther e are incidents, such as the incident of Bilaam, in which G -d took away his free choice and did not allow him to act according to his desire. Thus, he was incapable of cursing the Jewish people. The point of contemplating the Seder Hishtalshelut in a way of particulars is to see thi s reality in a true and inner manner. In other words, through the particular contemplation in the aforementioned manner, one comes to clearly understand how the end is totally and completely bound up with the beginning, and th at everything that occurs is literally from G -d Himself. This is to say, he becomes totally aware of G - d’s presence, in an inner way. (It is also understood from al l of the above that there are actually only ten sefirot . These are G - d’s ten sefirot . They are manifest in many different ways, but it is all G - d’s. That is to say, my kindness and someone else’s kindness are just different manifestations of the same Simple Essential Kindness of G -d. It is also clear from all of the above that it is only fitting to pray to G -d Himself. That is, if one were to pray to any “intermediary” in any of the worlds, it would be no different than thanking the hand for doing an act"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Nine At first glance, the verse, “I HaShem have not change d”, is not understood. Now , [ this verse] is speaki ng in regard to Malchut of Ein Sof (The Infinite ) Himself. However , if in Malchut of Asiyah (Actua lization) there is a change between judgment and kindness , which is [only] an aspect of a reaction , then it must be that in Malchut of Ein Sof (T he Infinite ) this change also takes place 1 . After all, it states, “See now that I, I am He” . It likewise states, “Your k ingdom is the kingdom of all worlds”, literally equally , 2 as explained previously . In other words, when the desire for kindn ess arises in His simple essential desire, this very same essential de sire for kindness descends until the very end, to the desire for kindness of Malchut of Asiyah , literally 3 . According to all the above mentioned , it is likewise understood that the oppo site is true as well 4 . Furthermore, we recite [daily] , 5 “He renews every day... the act of creation ” here below [in our physical world]. In other words, [“he renews”] in “ Kadmin – Desire” and “ Chochmeta – Wisdom”, [which are the translations] of “In the b eginning He created”. [These are “renewed”] all the way until the highest heights, literal ly in His Essential Self. This being the case, then [it seems ] that there is a renewal even in the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof) .   1 In the previous chapter we explained how the entire chaining d own from beginning to end is literally an act of G -d, and that he is the perpetrator of everything that occurs. This was the explanation of the verse, “See now that I, I am He”. If this is the case, then certainly if there is any change at the end action , there must also be a change in the beginning, in His essence. How then can we understand the aforementioned verse, “I HaShem have not changed?” 2 As explained in the previous chapter, a King is as much King in his capital as he is in the farthest reach es of his Kingdom. This is to say that he rules there as much as he does in his capital. Likewise, from Malchut of the Infinite to Malchut of Actualization ( Asiyah ), G -d is equally King. This is analogous to how a person’s innermost thoughts and end act ions are all equally him, as previously explained. 3 For example, when a very wise person takes a pen and writes down his wisdom, we do not say “If I could get my hands on such a pen I too would be wise”. Likewise, we do not say, “It is not the wisdom of the pen. Rather it is the wisdom of the hand, because it is the hand which moved the pen in such a wise way.” Rather, we immediately recognize that the person himself is wise, and that this is a revelation of his wisdom, not the pen’s wisdom and not the h and’s wisdom. 4 This is to say that this is not true only with the desire for kindness, but, it’s opposite desire also reaches to the very essence. The opposite of Kindness ( Chessed ) , is Sternness ( Gevurah ). Additionally, this may be understood differentl y. In other words, that the opposite is true as well. Not only is the beginning bound up with the end, but from the end action we may deduce the initial desire, which is at the beginning. 5 See the blessings before the Shema recital."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"How then ca n it state, “I HaShem have not change d”, [implying that there is no change] whatsoever? Similarly, we say 6 , “You are He befor e the creation of the world; You are He after the creation of the world”. This [principle] likewise applies “before He emana ted 7 ”, as is known. Moreover, in the analogy of man below, there is change from a desire for judgment to a desire for kindness, even in the essential desire, as is known. Lik ewise, how can we [pray and] request , “May it be desirable before Y ou”, [requesting of G -d to have] a new desire; that a desire for judgment should be overturned into a desire for kindness? [This question is further strengthened by the fact that] we see multitudes of changes every day, and every hour, in “everything that G - d desires” an d constantly does in the heavens and the earth 8 . Now, the resolution for all this is the matter of Tzimtzum 9 , as is known. For, if the influence was in a ma nner of cause and effect, then the matter of change and reaction would fall upon it. However, sin ce the aspect of the drawing down [of influence] is only in an aspect of a light and ray, and this too is by means of Tzimtzum , there is therefore no change at all in the Essence of G -dliness, even in Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah . 10 Such is the case , al l t he way to the highest level . After Tzimtzum [however] there is an aspect of change, but only from the perspective of the recipients, as is known 11 .   6 See the morning pr ayers. 7 See Avodat HaKodesh (R’ Meir ben Gabay) Chelek HaYichud, chapter 2. 8 The question is quite clear. We previously explained that the very end action is bound with the essence, literally. Since we see changes down here in the final reaction, certa inly in the original action there must be a change. How, then, can the verse state, “I HaShem have not changed” and other such verses? Furthermore, how is it possible for us to pray, asking G -d to overturn one desire for another desire, to bring about a different end action? 9 This will be explained momentarily. 10 In order to understand this paragraph, we must first understand the difference between a “light and ray” and an “influence” of cause and effect. An example of an influence of light is when a te acher expresses an intellectual thought into speech. Here, there is no change in his intellect at all, and it remains completely whole, as it was before he spoke. His intellect did not diminish whatsoever. Likewise, his speech itself did not diminish, i n that he does not run out of words. Furthermore, the recipient of this “light” did not receive the actual light of the intellect itself, but only a glimmer of it in the speech. The intellect remains where it was the entire time, in the mind of the teach er. This is an example of a “light and ray”. In contrast, an example of the “influence of cause and effect” is when one lifts a heavy object. Here, his strength will diminish slowly, and he will not be able to hold it indefinitely. There is a diminishm ent from the time he picked it up to later, and, therefore, there is a change. Furthermore, there is cause and effect here. Therefore if there is a difference in the effect it is because there is a difference in the cause. However, the chaining down of th e worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) is in the way of a “light and ray”. 11 This is to say that there is no diminishment or change whatsoever in the Essence. The appearance of change only comes about through the aspect of Tzimtzum , and then too it is only from the perspective of the recipients. This may be understood from the example of a slide projector. The slide projector emanates light. When, one puts a slide of film over the projector the image on the screen changes. However, clearly, no change has tak en place in the light itself and certainly not in the projector. Rather, the slide of film conceals some of the light to the recipients, so they only see the image of the slide. As explained above, the chaining down of the worlds is in a way of a “light and ray”. The allegory is therefore understood as follows: The light source is analogous to the Essence of G -d, while the light emanating from the projector is analogous to the Infinite Light. The slide is analogous to the aspect of Tzimtzum , which conc eals the light, but only from the perspective of the recipients. From the perspective of the light source no change has taken place. Therefore, since to begin with, the influence is entirely in the way of “light”, rather than “influence”, and furthermore, it is brought about through the aspect of Tzimtzum, in which there is no change, even to the light, it is quite clear that the Essence of G -d, Himself, has not changed at all."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The explanation of the difference between “ Or (Light ) and Shefa (Influence ) is known to all 12 . However, eve n in the aspect of the light it was necessary for [its revelation] to be by means of Tzimtzum . It is therefore incumbent upon every in dividual to know the matter of Tzimtzum and to contemplate it [relative] to each w orld according its value . This is becaus e it is the main principle in t he general matter of the unity od G -d, and [in understanding] ho w there is no change relative to the Essential Self [of G -d]. [This is to say ] that before Him, “ the darkn ess and the light are equal ” , 13 the spiritual and the p hysical are equivalent , so much so that the world of Atzilut and the world of Asiyah are equal [ before Him], as is known. Now, the [above] is only in relation to the encompassing light, which is called Sovev Kol Almin (The light that encompasses or transc ends all worlds) both generally and particularly . This [light] is higher than the level of light which is in an aspect of Memale Kol Almin (Permeating all worlds), as is known. However, even in the aspect of the pervading inner light of Memale , both gen erally and particularly, the re is no change. [Here too] its upper and lower [levels] are equivalent . This is as stated, “I HaShem have not changed”, and “I – Ani ” refers to the aspect of Memale [the pervading light] , as is known. Likewise it states 14 , “D o I not fill the he aven and the earth?” He, specifically , fills them equally . This too [refers to] the aspect of the inner per vading light, as in the dictum 15 , “There is no place de void of Him” , as is known . The reason for this is because even in the aspec t of [the pervading light of] Memale , the light and influence descends specifically by means of Tzimtzumim . 16 As is known even the aspect of the line and thread ( Kav V’Chut ) which is drawn from the Esse nce of the Infinite Light and is generally called the pervading light 17 of the worlds of ABY”A 18 , is , likewise, initially drawn by means of Tzimtzum in the Essence. This is the first Tzimtzum which is called the “empty place” and the “empty void”, as stated in Etz Chayim 19 . This is l ikewise the case in the des cent of the Kav 20 down , in to the aspects of Igullim and Yosher 21 , until it beco me s the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon , [this too] is by means of Tzimtzum . The same [principle] applies [in the descent] from Adam Kadmon to Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin . [It too i s by way of Tzimtzum ]. Even in the world of Atzilut itself, generally, there is a Masach 22 (screen) between Keter and Chochmah . This is the meaning of the verse 23 ,   12 See footnote 10. 13 Psalms 139:12 14 Jeremiah 23:24 15 See Tikkunei Zohar, 457 ( 91b) and 470 (122b) and other sources. 16 This is the plural of Tzimtzum . 17 Memale Kol Almin . 18 This is an acronym for the four worlds, Atzilut, Briyah , Yetzirah and Asiyah . 19 See Etz Chayim , Shaar 1, Anaf 2 ( Drush Igullim V’Yosher ) 20 The Kav is the thin ba nd of limited revelation. 21 This will all be explained later. The main point here is that since the revelation is only by way of a “light and ray”, and this revelation is by means of Tzimtzum , there is no change at all. There is no change in the Essence of G -d Himself. Furthermore, since the light is also restricted by means of Tzimtzum , there is no change even in the light. In order to truly appreciate and comprehend this, one must truly understand the manner of Tzimtzum , and how it is applied througho ut the chaining down. This will be explained later. 22 This may be understood as follows. The world of Atzilut corresponds to the general sefirah of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"“The curtain shall be for you as a division between the holy and the holy of holies”, as exp lained in the Zohar . Similarly, [there is a screen] between Abba and Imma to Zeir Anpin , and between Zeir Anpin and Nukva , as is known. [Furthermore] , between Malchut of Atzilut and Briyah , there is a Masach (screen) and Malchut penetrates the screen and becomes Keter of Briyah . In this manner, there is a Masach (screen) between Briyah and Yetzirah , and Malchut of Briyah penetrates the screen and becomes Keter of Yetzirah . Similarly, Malchut of Yetzirah penetrates the screen and becomes Keter of Asiyah . [This continues] until Malchut of Asiyah , which is called “ The King who is exalted and alone”. This is also like the statement of the Sages 24 , “Like the creation of the world: At f irst there was dark ness , and then the light returned” 25 . Similarly, the Sa ges stated 26 , “Initially it arose in His thought to create with the attribute of Judgment”. This [attribute of Judgment] is the aspect of Tzimtzum , [which is] the name Elokim of Malchut of Asiyah . This is as stated, “ Bereshit Bara Elokim – In the beginnin g G-d ( Elokim ) created etc” 27 . [“ Bereshit – In the beginning” i s translated as] “ Bechochmeta – With Wisdom”, and “ BeKadmin – With Desire”, which is the desire and wisdom of Malchut of Asiyah . This will suffice for those of understanding. According [to al l of the above ] everything is resolved [in regard to] the verse, “I HaShem have not change d”. [This is to say that there is no change] between a desire for kindness or for judgment in all of the worlds of ABY”A . In other words, [this refers to] how He is before the Tzimtzum or Masach (screen) through which [the light] penetrates and becomes the Keter of the lower world. It is, specifically, t o this aspect, [i.e. the Essence of G -d, that we       Chochmah . However, it is only from the last level of Chochmah that a flash of intuition comes into Binah . Furthermore, it is only through the intermediary medium of letters of description, that the light of the concept can be understood in Binah (Comprehension and grasp). The actual light of the Chochmah itself is altogether beyond the grasp of Binah . When a person has an intuitive flash, he does not perceive the light of Chochmah directly. The “light” which he “sees” is actually only the letters, which contain the light of intuition. Nonetheless, through the secondary “light” of the letters of the Chochmah as they come into Binah, the primary “essential light” of Chochmah is recognized. It is only viewed through the screen and partition of the letters, which is called a Masach . This may be understood by how a television works. Behind the television screen t here is a “ray gun” which emits a ray onto the back of the screen. When the ray hits the phosphorus points on the screen, they light up. What the viewer sees on the television screen is not the original light of the “ray gun”, but the secondary light of th e phosphorus. There is no change at all in the original light emanating from the ray gun. Furthermore, the secondary light is only an induced light. Similarly, in the world of Atzilut itself, there is no change. It is only in the Masach and Tzimtzum wh ere there is change. Likewise, in the Essence of the Infinite Light, and even in the Infinite Light before Tzimtzum , there is no change. It is only after Tzimtzum, to the recipients, where there is change. This should suffice for now, as this will all b e explained later at great length. 23 Terumah 26:33 24 See Tractate Shabbat 77b 25 The explanation of this is that first there was the concealment of the Tzimtzum and then afterwards there was the secondary induced light of the screen ( Masach ). In other word s, in the original Infinite Light, and in the Essence of G -d Himself, there is no change. This is like the aforementioned allegory of the television. 26 See Rashi on Bereshit 1:1 27 In other words, the creation of the world is specifically through the aspec t of Tzimtzum . This is signified by the Torah’s usage of the name Elokim in verses pertaining to creation. The name Elokim signifies the concealment of the name Havayah, which signifies revelation. This is understood from the verse, “A sun and a shield is Havayah Elokim .” In other words, the Tzimtzum of the name Elokim is like a “shield” or “screen” that covers over the revelation of the name Havaya ."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"pray and] say, “May it be desirable , specifically, before You ”. [Relative to th e Essen ce of G- d] all aspects of “higher” and “lower” in the world, are literally equivalent. However, after the Tzimtzum , the desire is drawn into the intellect and emotions with changes, until the aspect of Malchut of Asiyah [about whic h] we say , “May it be desirable before You” , [meaning that G -d should cause ] a change in actual ac tion, from judgment to kindness and the like. This will suffice those of understanding 28 .   28 An allegory used to explain this is a husband’s desire to please his wife. Because of this desire, he purchases a beautiful diamond ring. However, when he presents it to his wife, she does not like this particular ring, and is unhappy with it. Her husband returns to the store, exchanges the ring for a different one which is even more splendid and opulen t than the first one. Again, his wife is displeased with it. Again he returns to the store. This time he purchases a sapphire necklace. He brings it home and now his wife is pleased. Now, throughout, there was never a change, whatsoever, in the essentia l desire of the husband. It was only in the expression of this desire to the recipient (his wife) where change occurred. Here too, in regard to G -d, in the Inner essential light, which is analogous to the inner desire of the husband to please his wife, n o change occurs at all. It is only in the restriction of revealing this desire, i.e. in selecting a specific emanation to express this desire, where change occurs. Similarly, this is why we are capable of praying to G -d, and requesting of Him to change a revelation of judgment to a revelation of kindness. In G- d’s essential desire there is no change. It is only in the specific expression of this desire where there is the appearance of change. However, even in this constricted expression of the Essence, it is still G -d Himself who is absolutely in control, as explained in the previous chapter. This may be understood from the story of Esther. When the wicked Haman, may his name and memory be blotted out, came to antagonize and attack the Jewish people, Mordechai did not bow down or appeal either to Haman or King Achashverosh. Rather, he immediately recognized that G -d is the source of everything, including Haman. He therefore gathered all the Jewish people to repent and appeal to G -d Himself to avert t he evil decree. It is for this same reason that when we read the story of Esther on the festival of Purim, the written names of Mordechai and Haman are literally equal to each other. When the Megillah is read, just as if the reader were to miss the word “ Mordechai” we would not have fulfilled our obligation, so too, if he were to miss the word “Haman” we, equally, would not have fulfilled our obligation. This is because the inner light of both Mordechai and Haman, is G -d Himself. He is the active cause o f them both. This principle is true of everything in all of existence. Now, these three chapters, seven, eight and nine, cannot not be fully understood to the beginner. However, from chapters 10 to 54 the entire explanations of the entire chaining down ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) will be given. Afterwards, one should return to these chapters and study them over again."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Ten We must now understand all the particulars of the four worlds of ABY”A 1 in a specifi c manner. In other words, we must understand all the specifics in the matter of the ten sefirot of ABY”A , their lights and vessels, and their vestments , one within the other. Moreover , we must understand all their particulars, even how each sefirah divid es into its particular specifics. For example, [we must understand] even the aspect of Chessed of Malchut of Chochmah of Malchut of Chessed , and the like. [Furthermore, we must understand] the matter of the unifications and inclusions [of the sefirot ] in the aspect of the Keter of each world. [ Keter ] is the aspect of the intermediary between the upper world and the world which is below it . Briefly, t his general principle is known , that from the aspect of Malchut of the upper [world ], there comes about the Keter of the lower [world ]. This [principle] applies even to the highest levels 2 . However, all those who contemp late should first contemplate upon the primal source, which is called 3 “the source of everything” ( Mekora D’Koola ). That is, [he should co ntemplate] the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), [even] before the aforementioned first Tzimtzum which is called “the empty place” ( Makom Panooy ). There too [he should contemplate] in a particular manner , specifically. This [contemplat ion] is known as the “elongation of the אחד – One” 4 , [signifying that one is to contemplate] upon the Simple Unity ( אחדות הפשוטה ), specifically.   1 This is an acronym for the fo ur worlds, Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 2 This paragraph is like an introduction to this second part of the book. The Mittler Rebbe will now begin to explain the entire order of the chaining down of the worlds, from their very beginning to their very end. This will be done in a manner of particulars. That is, the particulars of each stage and sefirah of the entire chaining down will all be explained. In this way, a person who toils to understand the given explanations will be capable of underst anding and applying the principles he has learned even to the fifth power, and further, as mentioned above. As explained in preceding chapters, the purpose of knowing the explanations and order of the chaining down in a manner of particulars is so that th e depth of it will be brought close to a person in an inner way. The general explanation and essential point has already been explained in chapters seven, eight and nine. Although the Mittler Rebbe will not explain every single particular detail, since s uch a book would have to be infinite, he nonetheless sets forth the entire knowledge necessary for one to understand all the particulars. This is as he states in the beginning of chapter five. 3 See Zohar Bereshit 33a. ( Mekora D’Koola ) 4 In the Shema reci tal, when reciting the verse, “Hear ‘o Israel, the L -rd our G -d, the L - rd is one”, Jewish law dictates that one is to lengthen the word “One – אחד”. During this time, he is to contemplate G - d’s absolute unity. This is learned out from the word “On e – אחד ” itself. The first letter א‘ – Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and has a numerical value of 1. Furthermore, it represents the “ Alupho Shel Olam – The Master of the universe”, who is absolutely singular. The next letter, ‘ ח – Chet , has a numerical value of Eight, and corresponds to the seven heavens (or firmaments ) and the earth . The next letter ד‘ – Dalet , has a numerical v alue of four, and corresponds to the four directions. We are taught that one is to"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" In general, this [Simple Unity] is divided i nto three levels, each of which includes ten sefirot 5 . These [thr ee levels are called] Yachid - Singular , Echad – One, and Kadmon – Primordial. All of this is still within the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) before the aforementioned first Tzimtzum . The aspect of Yachid – Singular, co nnotes that He is literally alone 6 . This is higher than the unity of parts which is called Echad – One, as is known. Accordingly, in the aspect of the actual Essence of the Infinite Light it is not yet fitting to discuss the matter of the ten sefirot at all. For example, [to say] “ Malchut of the Infinite ” would automatically imply an understanding that it was preceded by the aspect of Keter and Chochmah etc. Now, in truth, even the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light which is called “Alone” incl udes ten sefirot within itself . However, they are called 7 , “He is wise, but not with a knowable wisdom etc”, to the point where we say, “He is not of an y of these attributes at all ”, as is known. The explanation of the matter is that in truth, just as th e Essence of the Infinite ( Atzmoot Ein Sof ) is an absolutely simple light , so is this [the case] with His light and ray which is called the Infinite Light 8 ( Ohr Ein Sof ). As mentioned previously, this is the meaning of “Before the cre ation of the world th ere was He and His name alone 9 ”. This [level] is what is called the “upper purity” . 10 This is the matter of the revelation of th e light of His Essence, specifically as it is . This [level] is called Yachid – Singular. Tha t is, there is nothing besides Him that the t erminology of “unity” or “singularity ” may be applied to . This is the meaning of 11 “He is one, but not in enumeration ” of ten. However, from the fact that they stated, “He is wise, but not with a knowable wisdom etc”, it is , nonetheless , [appar ent] that there are various categories and levels [such as] wise,       contemplate how G - d’s absolute unity and singularity (‘ א ) remains the same in the seven heavens and the earth ( ח‘ ) and in all the four directions ( ד‘ ). The word אחד also s ignifies the unity of the ten sefirot . The first letter ‘ א represents the first sefirah of Keter , to which all the other sefirot are bound . The second letter ח‘ represents the next eight sefirot , from Chochmah through Yesod . The last letter ד‘ represent s the sefirah of Malchut . The reason for this is because the root of the word Dalet is Dal which means poor. Malchut is called poor for it is a receptacle which has nothing of its own, only what it receives from the 9 sefirot which are above it. (Anothe r reason the ד‘ corresponds to Malchut is because of the numerical value of ד‘ , which is four. Malchut transmits the four sefirot, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod to the next world, as will later be explained.) Here though, the main point of the Rebbe is t hat one is to contemplate how G - d’s unity is before the Tzimtzum , and before any creation at all. This level is called Achdoot HaPshoota – the Simple Unity. The Rebbe will now continue and explain the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light before th e Tzimtzum . 5 The obvious question here is, “Did we not just say that this level is an Absolute Singularity? How then can it be divided into three levels, each of which includes ten sefirot , thus totaling thirty levels?” This will soon be explained and u nderstood. 6 This is to say that only He, the Essence of His being, exists. 7 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar. 8 In other words, just as He is absolutely simple and removed from all complexity of description and particular parts, i.e. He is absolutely s ingular, so too his light and ray, the revelation of Himself, is absolutely simple etc. 9 In other words, just as He is “alone”, so His name, the revelation of Himself, is “alone”. This is also the meaning of “You are holy, and Your Name is holy”. In oth er words, just as He, in Essence, is “holy and removed”, so is His Name, the Infinite Light, “holy and removed”. 10 Tehiroo Ila’a 11 Tikkunei Zohar 17a"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"understanding, merci ful etc. [Nevertheless,] all of this is not [stated] in regard to His Essence, but only in regard to what He estimate d within Himself in potential , that which is destine d to be in actuality after the aforementioned first Tzimtzum 12 (As written in Mikdash Melech 13 , quoting the Arizal himself, and as explained elsewhere at length.) This is also the meaning of the first general teaching of the Zohar 14 , “In the beginning of the rule of the King, He engraved an engraving in the upper purity”. The explanation of this is that in the aforementioned Essence of the revelation of His simple light, which is called the upper purity, “He en graved an engraving”, which is the matter of eng raving letters. “The beginning of the rule [of the King]” , refers to when it arose in His simple desire. This is the aspect of Keter 15 , whereas t he aspect of the letters which He engraved is the aspect of Malchut 16 of the Infinite Light. If this is the ca se, then there is a beginning and end, a Keter and Malchut , even in the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light. The explanation of this is that it arose in His simple thought and desire, “ Ana Emloch – I sha ll rule” . All of this is still totally wit hin His Essence. [That is, it ] still precedes the matter of the estimation within himself , in potent iality , of what his revealed desire for Kingship will be , after the first Tzimtzum, which is called the “empty place” 17 . The allegory for this , as is known, is from the powers of the soul, as they come into revelation from desire until action. All of these [powers] and their specifics exist in the concealed light of the essence of the soul, which is called the aspect of Yechidah 18 . For example, when a person [who ] desires kindness and goodness, [desires ] to do a particular act of goodness, this comes about because he possesses this attribute of kindness and goodness in the aspect of the essence of his soul, which is called Yechidah . It is for this reason tha t this   12 The explanation of this is that although the ten sefirot do exist within the Essence of the Infinite Lig ht before the Tzimtzum , they cannot be considered as descriptive qualities. That is to say, since they do not exist as entities separate from the Essence itself, they therefore cannot be described as anything separate from the Essence. Since the Essence is indescribable, its qualities are likewise indescribable. When it states that these qualities exist, as in “He is wise etc”, this is not a statement of description at all. Rather, it is only an informative statement that the Creator of these qualities is Himself not lacking them. For, otherwise, from where did these qualities originate? This is further supported by the statement, “Shall He who formed the eye not see etc?” However, if he does possess these qualities, how can we say that there is no di vision? The above statement of the Tikkunim therefore continues and informs us, “He is not of any of these attributes altogether”. The Rebbe will soon explain how the sefirot do exist, yet at the very same time there is no existence apart from the Singul ar Essence of the Infinite Light. 13 See Mikdash Melech, Zohar volume one, 15a. 14 See Zohar Bereshit, 15a 15 As mentioned previously, and as will be expounded on later, Keter is the faculty of pleasure and desire. 16 Malchut is the aspect of the letters, i.e. the receptacles for the light of the desire and the other attributes which precede it. This will be explained in great detail later on. Furthermore, the “letters” which were “engraved” are “ Ana Emloch – I will be King”. 17 This is to say that G -d, even in His Essence, possessed within Himself the ability for all of these attributes and all the particulars thereof. This is true even before any estimation of the potential of His Kingship in Creation, such as “who He will rule over etc.” Rather, even before any estimation at all, G -d possessed and continues to possess this ability. Nonetheless, these Essential attributes do not describe Him in any way whatsoever, for they are not separate from Him. This will now be explained. 18 Yechidah means Singular. Th is level of the soul is its very essence, which is bound and connected to the Singular Essence of G -d. It is for this reason that it is called Yechidah (fem.), for in it is vested the Singular – Yachid (masc.)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"desire for kindness comes into revelation from its concealment 19 . Furthermor e, we must say that , certainly , this desire for kindness in the essence of his soul exists in a way of an essential Heyulie 20 power. [That is to say] it includes within it self everythin g that he may come to desire of kindness and goodness, in every particular specific that may be asked of him. If this is the case, we must say that prior to his revealed arousal of desire and will to express his kindness in this particular dee d, it was included in the essential Heyulie desire for kindness. It then came out of the Heyulie state to become revealed in this particular act. Furthermore, we observe that in the [revealed] desire for kindness, there is intellect, wisdom, emotions, th ought, speech and action 21 . It is therefore certain that in the source of this desire for kindness, while it was concealed in the essential Heyulie desire for kindness, there too , it included these divisions of intellect, emotions, thought, speech and acti on which it possesses. However, in the aspect of the essential Heyulie desire for kindness, as it exists prior to being expressed into a particular thing, even though there too there are divisions of intellect and emotions etc, nevertheless, they a re incl uded and unified with an ultimate [unity]. This likewi se applies to any othe r particular essential qualities , such as the quality of Gevurah - Judgment , Tiferet – Beauty (or Mercy) , or Netzach – Conquest , and the like 22 . [This is so,] until the attribute o f Malchut, which is the quality of leadership . Certainly, it too includes ten [qualities , such as ] the desire and will for kingship, the wisdom [for kingship], emotions, thoughts, [speech and action] etc. However, before it comes to a n aspect of revelati on in a particular thing, such as ruling over a specific country etc, they were absolutely included and unified in the aspect of the essential Heyulie desire for kingship. [This is] similar to [what was explained] regarding the aforementioned essential He yulie desire for kindness. If so, it is automatically understood [ in regard to ] the essential Heyulie attributes of Keter, Chochmah, Binah, Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malchut , [all of] which are in the essence of the soul , that i t is not fitting to speak of them using a terminology of   19 This is to say that it is because in essen ce he is a kind person that any kindness comes out into revelation through his kind deeds. The evidence for this essential kindness is from the fact that he constantly does acts of kindness. His emotions are emotions of kindness, and his thoughts are kin d thoughts. If he was not kind in essence, then where did the kindness come out from? 20 See Chapter Two, footnote 17. A Heyulie power is an ability, as opposed to a potential. This will now be explained in greater detail with many more analogies. 21 Th is is to say that in the revealed desire for kindness, there is the desire for kindness, the intellectual kindness of thinking kind thoughts in kind terms, there is the wisdom of what type of kindness is necessary, there are the emotions of kindness, there is kind speech, and finally the kind act. For example, when a kind person encounters a poor person, first there is the desire of kindness towards this individual. Then, he thinks, “I should help this person out”. He then contemplates the best manner in which to help this person, such as whether to give him money, or to give him food, for, if he gives him money he may go and purchase alcohol etc. There are the kind emotions of pity and mercy, and then the gut emotions which move him to act upon it and r each into his pocket and act upon this desire. There is also the kind speech, that he speaks kind and uplifting words to this impoverished individual. Certainly, all of these particulars exist in the essence of the soul of the kind person, in the Heyulie desire for kindness. For, otherwise, where did they come from? 22 In other words, just as the essential Heyulie desire for kindness includes its particular divisions within itself, similarly, the essential Heyulie desire for judgment includes its particul ar divisions within itself. For example, there is the desire for judgment, intellect of judgment, emotions, thought, speech and action of judgment etc."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"“unification” or “inclusio n”, [stating that they are “unifi ed”] in the essence of the soul which is called Yechidah . This is because they ar e not separate from the essence , whatsoever. For example, with the aforementioned attribute of the Heyulie desire for kindness which is embedded in the essential nature [of the kind person, it cannot be spoken of as separate from his essence] 23 . The essence of the soul itself is even higher than being [called] an “essential desire for kindness” , since this [kindness] is only a particular par t of the actual essential being which is ultimate ly simple. However, a lthough [this desire for kindness] is only a single particular which is drawn from the essence, it is no netheless impossible to say about it that it “unifies” with the Heyulie attribute of Netzach – Conquest, which is [also ] embedded in the essence of the soul. This is because the two are both absolutely united with the essence, and are not at all separate from the self. By way of analogy, the powe r of movement which is actually included in the essence of an animal even before it moves , altogether, is not at all separate from the essence of the animal. Now , in the revelation of this [ Heyulie ] power of move ment, [ that is, when the animal] makes a particular movement, it divides into many particular ways [to move]. It is [nonetheless] impossible to state that all the particular movements were “ included ” and “ unified ” while the power of movement was included in the essence of the animal. This is because at that point it wa s not within the category or definition of a “movement” at all, not general ly and not particularly. This is likewise [the case ] with the aspect of the revelation and spreading forth of the life force to enliven the entire body, while it is still completely included in the essential spirit of life. [This life force] di vides into [various powers, such as ] sight to the eye, and hearing to the ear etc. Certainly, even before it came forth to materialize in the eye and ear in actua lity, there was included [in this life force] a spiritual power and life force of sight for itself, and a spiritual power and life force of hearing for itself etc . Nonetheless, bef ore the essence of the soul came to the category of the spreading forth of life force , even though it was included in it, nonetheless, it is in the same way that the aforementioned power of movement is included in the essence of the animal 24 . It is only applicable to [use a terminology of] inclusion and unification of “sight” and “hearing” when [these forces] are destined and prepared to come into revelation in actuality, to enliven [the body]. However, while they were still completely included in the essence of the soul, it was as if this [aspect of] “spreading forth of life force” was completely nonexistent. This is because the essence of the soul itself is much higher than the asp ect of “spreading forth”, except that it includes within itself this [ ability ] to spre ad forth [and enliven] as well, just as the essence of the animal includes within itself the power of movement, as explained above.   23 In other words, we do not say that he is in possession of the power of kindness, but rather, we s ay that he himself is a kind person. 24 In other words, all that exists is the singular essence of the soul. This power of spreading forth to enliven a body is not separate from the essence in any way whatsoever. Furthermore, just as the power of movement of the essence can not at all be considered “movement”, so too, this power to spread forth and enliven a body cannot be considered anything at all, more than an ability of the essence itself. This is to say that it has no actual existence separate from t he essence of the soul itself, and can therefore not be considered as anything unto itself. All that exists at this point is the singular essence of the soul itself."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" If so, then how is it fitting or proper [to use terminologies] such as the aspects of “unification” and “inclusion” of the particular light and l ife force? [Rather,] it is only fitting in regard to the particular divisions of life force which are destined and prepared to spread forth into revelation. From this we are forced to say that all these particulars which spre ad forth [into revelation], [ exist] completely included with in the essence, for if this was n ot the case, then where did these particulars in the spreading forth of revelation come from? 25 This is like the light and rays which are included in the essence of the sun. [In other words,] concealed within [the sun] are all the particular ways of the spreading forth of the rays etc. Th is will suffice for those of understanding. We find that there are three levels, one following the next, which are drawn from the actual essence of the soul , which is called Yechidah . The first [level] is the ten essential Heyulie powers, like the essential Heyulie desire for kindness, and the like. They are absolutely and totally included in [the essence]. [This is] like the inclusion of the power of mov ement in the essence of the animal, or like the inclusion of the [power] to “spread forth life force” which is included in the essence [of the soul] , as explained above. In regard to these [ Heyulie powers] it is not fitting to use a terminology of “unific ation of separate parts together”. This is because they are completely included in the essence, and it is as if they have no existence at all 26 , as explained above. The second [level] is the aspect of the spreading forth of the ten powers, as they are pre pared to come into revelation. This is like when the essential Heyulie desire for kindness comes to do a particular act of kindness. [However, this is] still before it is drawn out into actuality. It is only destined and prepared to come out to this par ticular [act of kindness]. Here, [in this level , ] the matter of “unification” of the many particulars which are within it , is applicable. For example, [included within this is ] the intellect and the emotions of t his desire for kindness which are drawn fr om their concealment in the general Heyulie . The third [level] is when it is drawn to that particular [act of kindness], only it did not yet come out into [actual revelation] due to some lacking or obstacle. However, the preparation itself is already com plete. The only thing that is missing is for it to come out and be revealed in actuality. In other words, he already estimated within himsel f in a particular manner, [everything that is necessary to bring] this thing into actuality. This is to say that he estimated within himself in potential 27 what is necessary [for him] to bring [this revelation] into actuality. In the aforementioned allegory of the power of movement , [this can be seen ] when it is prepared and destined to come into revelation in a pa rticular [movement]. In the example of the spreading forth of life force to enliven the body, [this can be seen ] when it is prepared to   25 In other words, from the fact that we observe these particulars once they are revealed from their source, we must say that they exist in their source, for otherwise, where did they originate from? 26 In other words, they have no existence apart from the essence of the soul at all. It is therefore not proper to say that they are “united” in t he essence, since they are not separate to begin with. Furthermore, it is as if they have no actual existence at all, as in the aforementioned example of the power of movement. There is no “movement” in the essence, not in a general way, nor in a particu lar way. 27 “ Shi’er B’Koach” can also be translated as; He estimated in his strength or power, how much is necessary to bring this action into actuality. This will be understood from the Rebbe’s following analogy."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"come out [of the essence]. At this point, all the particular life forces [like sight and hearing] are completely inclu ded in a general unity. After this, he estimates within himself and prepares within his power of movement, how to m ove in a particular way . Similarly, [regarding the example of the influx of life force], there is the estimation of the revelation and spre ading forth of the spirit of life, as he prepares within himself to enliven [a body] in actuality. Another example is the power of growth, as it is prepared to grow in actuality. Here too , there are these three levels. Furthermore, [all three of these l evels] are before anything came out into actuality. For example, in the [power of] movement [this entire estimation] is before any actual physical movement. Or, in the spiritual life force, [this preparation] is before it actually comes into a physical b ody. Then, there is a change from a spiritual existence to a physical existence, such as a physical movement and physical life force. The same is true in the example of the physical growth. For this [change of existence] it is nec essary for there to be an initial Tzimtzum - contraction and restraint in the revelation of this spiritual [ Heyulie ]. This is so that there may be [a transition] from spiritual to physical (as will be explained in chapter 12).

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Eleven Now, the analogue for all that was mentioned above 1 about the soul [of man] may be understood by [a person who conceptualizes [how it is] above in the Essence of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum , which is called Yachid - Singular. Included [in the level of Yachid ] there are also ten sefirot . These are called “the ten sefirot which are concealed . ” 2 [T hey are] hidden in the Essence, literally. For example, the simple desire for the entire chai ning down, which is a specific [line of revelation], arose because of the desire for kindness included in the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light. This is as stated in the introduction of Etz Cha im 3 , “When it arose in His simple desire”. Cer tainly the reason for this arousal of the simple desire of His Essence is only because “He desires kindness” with in His Essential self. It the refore arose in His desire to bestow H is goodness and kindness, to be a source for the source of the chaining down of the line and thread ( Kav V’Chut ). This is like the aforementioned analogy, where, because of the essential attribute of the [ Heyulie ] des ire for kindness which is included in the aspect of the Yechidah [of the soul] , it arises in [a person’s] desir e to do goodness and kindness through a specific act, as explained previously. [That is,] it becomes revealed from its concealment in the Heyuli e for the desire of kindness, to include every particular that will ever arise in his desire to bestow goodness. Everything [that becomes revealed] comes because of [this Heyulie ], and because of its strength. Furthermore, the revelation of the desire wh ich comes because of this [ Heyulie ] desire for kindness includes ten [ sefirot ]; Ch aBa”D 4 , emotions etc. From this we must conclude that also the aspect of the Heyulie desire for kindness which is literally included in the Essence, likewise includes ten [ sefirot ]; intellect and emotions etc. However, it is not   1 In chapter ten the Rebbe explained the concept of Heyulie , and how everything which comes from the essence of the soul must be included there in the way of a Heyulie . He gave various allegories, such as the act of kindness, the power of movement, and the spreading forth of life force to enliven the body etc. Furthermore, he explained the three levels in the essence of t he soul, before any revelation in a defined line of action. He now will relate these analogies to the three aforementioned levels and the ten sefirot as they exist within the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ) before the Tzimtzum . 2 In Hebrew thi s is “ Eser Sefirot Hagnoozot BeHelem Ha’Atzmoot ”. 3 See Etz Chaim, Shaar 1, Anaf 2. Also see, Etz Chaim Shaar HaKlallim, chapter 1. There it states, “When it arose in His desire to create the world, blessed be His name, in order to bestow goodness unto H is creatures...” This indicates that the desire for creation comes from a desire to bestow kindness and goodness. 4 This is an acronym for the three intellectual sefirot , Chochmah , Binah and Da’at ."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"fitting to speak of them using a terminology of “inclusion” or “unification”, since they are still included in the Essence in the way of a Heyulie 5 . This is likewise the case in regard to the other qualities such as the qualities of Gevurah , Netzach or Tiferet etc. They are all included in the Essence of the Infinite Light which is called the “Upper Purity”. It is this [level ] which is called Yachid – Singular, and is higher then Echad Pashut – Si mple One ness [or Unity] 6 . This [inclusion] is so, until the quality of Kingship in the Essence of the Infinite Light, which is called Malchut of the Infinite. I t too is included in the aspect of the essential Heyulie of the essence of the Infinite Light. [Furthermore,] it is literally unlimited. Just as the desire for kindness of the Essence is completely unlimited, and [just as] there is no limit to His wisdom, likewise, the attribute of “ruling over” ( Malchut ) which is included in the Essence of the In finite Light, is unlimited. Moreover, in the concealment of the Essence it [too] includes ten [ sefirot ]. Th ese are the desire , pleasure, wisdom and emotions of the quality of Kingship – Malchut . However, the matter of “I shall rule” which arose in H is s imple desire and thought , repres ents [the essential Heyulie desire for kingship] as it co me s out of the concealment of the Heyulie 7 , to be revealed in a particular thing; [namely,] the entire chaining down of the worlds 8 . This is similar to what was exp lained above in regard to the quality of the desire for kindness in a human being bel ow , and as explained in the analogy of the ten powers which are included in the aspect of the Yechidah [of the soul] , [that they are there] in a way of an essential Heyuli e . [That is,] they are not at all separate from the essence. Similarly, [analogies were given of] the power of movement which i s included in the essence of an animal, and the Heyulie ability to spread forth life force [and enliven] , which is included in the essence of the soul, literally, as previously explained. Lower than this [level] is the aspect of the Infinite Light which radiates and spreads forth 9 . However, this is all still in the aspect of His Essence, before the Tzimtzum 10 . This [level] is wh at is called “ Achdut HaPshuta – Simple Oneness [or Unity]”. Here it is possible [to speak of the] “inclusion” and “unification” of the ten sefirot , [however,] they too are called 11 “ten   5 That is, they have no actual existence separate from the Essence itself, and can therefore not be said to be “included” or “unified” with the essence. 6 Yachid – Singular connotes an aspect of aloneness and absolute singularity of existence. In contrast, as mentioned previously, Echad – One, connotes a unity of parts to form a single whole. This level of existence, the very Essence of the Infinite Light, is the level called Yachid – Singular. That is, only G -d exists, as a simple singularity, and there is nothing besides Him. 7 That is, this is lower than t he above mentioned level of Yachid , which only includes within it the Heyulie ability for this revelation etc. 8 That is, the entire chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) is like a single line of action or revelation. As in the aforementioned example of “movement”, it is like a single line of movement and revelation from the concealed Heyulie power of movement. 9 That is, there is a spreading forth and revelation from these “ten concealed Heyulie sefirot ” of the Essence of the Infinite Light. 10 In other words, this “light” and revelation is not outside of Him. Rather, it is a revelation, to Himself, of what will be revealed after the Tzimtzum . This means that it is the revelation of what will be revealed, however, it is before any actual reve lation to a recipient. 11 See Sefer Yetzirah Chapter 1, Mishnah 2"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"sefirot without ‘what ness ’” 12 , because , nonetheless, they are still bey ond the aspect of preparing to influence below, in [actual] revelation . However, it is ready to come out of the Heyulie state [into revelation] in a particular matter . For example, in the aforementioned analogy of the Heyulie desire for kindness, [this is ] when it comes to the realm of will and desire [to be expressed in actuality] in the chaining down of a line [of action]. Although , even within Himself , this has not yet come out into complete revelation, nonetheless, here the aspects of “uni ty ” and “inc lusio n” are applicable . However, it is called a “Simple Unity” because it is still with in the light of the Essence, which is of the ultimate simplicity. For example, in the [ Heyulie ] desire for kindness there are the aspects of division of intellect and emotions etc , even before it comes into any [actual] revelation whatsoever. [It is] because of [these concealed qualities] that it arose in His [revealed] desire and wisdom to bestow goodness, as was previously explained in regard to the second level in the soul of man 13 . Now, the third [level] is when from the aspect o f this desire for kindness, it already arose in the desire and intellect etc. A n entire estimation is ready in “letters” , 14 which He estimates within Himself of how the influence will actu ally be drawn outside of His Essence. For example, in the analogy of the power of movement, [this is when he] prepares how to move 15 . [This may also be compared] to the power of t he life force of the soul , as it is ready to enliven. [This is to say that ] they are a lready ready and estimated in a limited way, as previously explained in regard to the third level in the soul [of man]. Similarly, [in regard to G -d] above, this [level] is what He estimated within the Essence of the Infinite Light, which is called the “Upper Purity” . [That is, He makes] an estimation of how everything that he desires in the entire chaining down [will be revealed] , as an actual line of revelation, all the way until the end of world of Asiyah 16 . This , then , is [the meaning of] the statement, “He engraved an engraving in the Upper Purity” , as mentioned previou sly.   12 That is, they are still totally beyond description. This is because, until the first Tzimtzum , the essence of G-d is totally revealed and, therefore, their existence is not at all separate from Him. Therefore, because His Essence is beyond description, the revelation of His Essence is also beyond description. As mentioned above, these sefirot still precede any actual revelation. Furthermore, as will now be explained, this revelation stil l precedes the aspect of the aforementioned “estimation”. 13 That is, if the particulars did not exist in this concealed Heyulie desire of the essence, which is the source, then where did these particulars come from when they are revealed? We must therefo re say that they certainly are included there, only that they are concealed in the Heyulie of the desire for kindness of the essence. 14 As previously mentioned and as will later be explained at great length, “letters” refers to a definition or “containment ” of something. Here, these particular “letters” refer to the “letters” of the simple essential desire which arose in the Essence. That is, this is an actual estimation, in potential, of everything that will be revealed after the Tzimtzum , as an actual r evelation of the entire chaining down of the “line” of influence to the recipient. The Rebbe will now compare this to the aforementioned allegory of movement. The previous level to this is called “ Ratzon HaPashut – The Simple Desire”, which does not yet have any definite form of how it will come to be expressed. In contrast, this level is called “ Ratzon HaMuchlat – The Determined Desire”. That is, He has already determined, estimated and prepared within Himself how the influence will be expressed. 15 For example, when one reaches for something, like a glass of water, he estimates within himself the entire line of action, (i.e. how much energy to apply, in which direction to move etc...) before he makes any actual movement at all. 16 The world of Actualizatio n."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"This level is called Kadmon – Primordial [or Preceding]. In other words, this is the desire for the manner of the influence, which precedes any actual revealed influ ence. [A ll] this is still prior to the first Tzimtzum , which is called the “Void” or “Empty Place” , 17 as mentioned previously. This will suffice for those of understanding. Now, the fourth level 18 is how after the Tzimtzum (withdrawal) , there remained an aspect of an impression ( Reshimu ), from which the line [of limited revelation] was drawn. This is generally [called] the “Lower Purity”, which is the general encompassing [light] for the entire chaining down of the line 19 . [The line] comes as an aspect of influence low er than the Essence, as in the analogy of the life force which spreads forth in revelation, to enliven [the body]. It is also similar to the power of movement which spreads forth to actually move [the body], in a revealed way. [Here ], there is a change from spiritual existence to physical existence, as previously mentioned. This is [also] similar to the physical growth [of a plant, which comes] from the spiritual [power] of growth. Likewise , this is the difference between the light which f ollows Tzimtzum compared to the Es sential Light which precedes Tzimtzum 20 . Because of this [infinite difference], the matter of Tzimtzum was necessary . It was specifically so that there could be a [limited] ray and line of light 21 , the purpose of which is t o be the source of the worlds of ABY”A 22 , as is known . Nevertheless 23 , all the particular specifics of the ten sefirot of ABY”A were originally included in the Essence of the Infi nite Light, in the aspect of an Essential Heyulie . Afterwards, by means of th e Tzimtzum , it changes [to be revealed] in a limited fashion, according to the   17 The first Tzimtzum is called the Challal – Void, and Makom Panooy – Empty Space. 18 The Rebbe has now completed explaining the three levels in the Upper Purity before the Tzimtzum . He will now begin to explain the following levels in the chaining down , which is the Tzimtzum itself, and the Reshimu – Impression which remains etc. Analogies and broader explanations will be given in the following chapters. 19 In other words, this desire encompasses the entire chaining down of the line of revelation, equa lly. Were this desire to be removed, the entire chaining down would cease to be. One’s desire encompasses all of one’s actions, and is the cause and source of them all. This concept will be explained further in chapters 17 and 18. 20 In the analogy of mo vement there is an absolute difference between the light of the Infinite ability to move and an actual single line of movement. This is likewise the difference between the Infinite Light which precedes the Tzimtzum in comparison to the single ray of limit ed revelation which follows Tzimtzum . This is to say that the entire chaining down of the worlds is comparable to a single line of action, and is literally like nothing in comparison the Essential Heyulie ability of the Essence of the Infinite Light. 21 Fo r example, in order for one to bring forth a single limited line of movement from his essential infinite ability for movement, he must restrain himself to a single line of movement. This can be seen by a situation in which a person is attacked (G -d forbid ) by a wild animal. Because he is so frightened, he freezes and is incapable of moving. This is because his desire is to run in all directions at once. However, because at this point he is not in control of his senses, he cannot focus and restrain himse lf to a single line of movement. He, therefore, cannot move at all (because of the limitations of his body which force him to do a single action at a time.) This may also be observed in people who stutter. It comes about because of a difficulty in decidi ng upon a single line of speech. Likewise above, in order for there to be a limited line of revelation, it is necessary for there to be this aspect of Tzimtzum – restraint. 22 This is an acronym for the worlds Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 23 This m eans to say; although there is such an awesome difference between the light which precedes Tzimtzum and that which follows it..."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"general influence of the line 24 , which is the aspect of the [general] encompassing [light]. This is similar to the spiritual life force of the soul when it comes to enliven the body. Included in the spiritual [life force] are all the particular specifics of the physical life force, such as the physical sight and hearing etc, as explained previously 25 . (The matter of the Tzimtzum and the Impression – Reshimu which remained, will be explained in the next chapter.) (This , 26 then , is the general explanation for t hat which is written 27 , “ Blessed is He who said and the world came into being ”. The explanation is that “He said 28 ” in concealment , in His simple desire in Malchut of Ein Sof (The Infinite ), as it still is included with in the aforementioned essential [ Heyulie ] desire for kindness. Afterwards, “ [and the world] came into being ”, [refers to] the revelation of light which s preads forth for a specific matter to chain down, to becom e the source of all the worlds. The explanation of “the world came to be” , is [that it came to be] specifically from t hat which He estimated within Himself in potential etc. For, this is the source for what comes into existence afterwards, i.e. the gener al world which is drawn from the Kav - Line, as mentioned above. This will suffice for those of understanding. [The prayer then continues,] “Blessed is He”. [The word “He”] is in the third person. This refers to the aspect of the Predecessor of the wor ld – Kadmono Shel Olam 29 . In other words, this is the aspect of [ Kadmon , which is] the estimatio n within Himself in potential . This is as stated 30 , “ He declares the end from the beginning ”, i.e. from the “beginning” of the Kav - Line , to its end. The verse then continues, “ Umikedem Asher Lo Na’aseh – And from antiquity, 31 [He declares] that which has yet to been done ” . This [too] means, from the Predecessor of the world – Kadmono Shel Olam . [This] is also called 32 , “ Yemei Kedem – The days of antiquity ”. That is, it precedes that which is drawn in the Kav [the limited line of revelation]. This refers to the fact that H e preceded [and prepared ] within himself in potential, t hat which is destined to come out in actuality. This will su ffice for those of underst anding. [The prayer] then states, “Blessed is He who says and does”. This refers to what is actually drawn into the Kav . [The prayer continues,] “Blessed is He who makes the Beginning”. This   24 In other words, by means of Tzimtzum there is a change from infinite revelation to a finite band of revelation, as in the afore mentioned analogy of the power of movement and an actual line of movement. 25 If these particulars were not included in the original estimation for the line of revelation and higher, then it would be impossible for them to be revealed from there. Rather, i t is through the restraint of the whole of the power of movement that revelation of a specific limited movement is possible. 26 This parenthesis may be skipped by the beginner, since many of the concepts mentioned within it will only be explained later in t he book.) 27 See the beginning of the daily prayers, “ Baruch She’amar ”. 28 In Kabbalah, the Hebrew word “ Amar - Said” refers to one’s thoughts to himself, whereas “ Dibur – Speech” refers to actual speech, as will later be explained. 29 The usage of the third person “He” indicates that the one spoken of is not present. Rather, He is concealed. This refers to the estimation, in potential, for the entire creation as it is before any creation is revealed. In contrast, the usage of “You” indicates the G -dliness which is immediate and vested within Creation. 30 Isaiah 46:10 31 The Hebrew word used here is Kedem , which refers to the aspect of Kadmon . 32 Micha 7:20"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"refers to the entire measure of the stature of Adam Kadmon 33 (Primordial Man) etc. [The prayer continues,] “Blessed is He who decrees and fulfills” – in the beginning .

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twelve We 1 must now understand the explanation of the aforementioned concept of the firs t Tzimtzum , and the aspect of the Reshimu (Impression) which remained. Although it is known to those who are familiar [with these concepts] , nonetheless, there are many particular details in it . One must delve very deeply in to this [m atter], for it is pi votal to true union with the Essence of the Infinite Light. [That is, the understanding of this is pivotal to the realization of] how everything, even the entirety of the chaining down of the Kav , is literally as nothing before Him. [This should be conte mplated] to the point that a person is capable of focusing his desire, with self sacrifice, upon the Essence of the Infinite Light alone 2 . This is as stated 3 , “You are He, G - d, Alone etc”. This is [also] the meaning of, “ The King who is exalted, alone”, [which refers to] the aspect of Malchut of the Infinite before the Tzimtzum . That is, “He is exalted” even “over the days of the world” of Adam Kadmon , w hich are called “the days of antiquity ”, as previously mentioned. This is [als o] the explanation of t he verse, “The heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, cannot contain You” 4 ]. “The heavens” refers to the aspect of the general encompassing [light] which follows the Tzimtzum . “The heavens of the heavens” refers to [the Infinite Light] before the Tzimt zum . “ They cannot contain Y ou” even in the way of a “vessel for a vessel”, as in “He engraved an engraving in the upper purity” 5 . This will suffice for those of understanding.   1 This first paragraph serves as an introduction to the next several chapters. 2 In other words, when a person contemplates and truly r ealizes that everything in existence is literally nothing, while G -d alone is the only true something, he loses all interest and value in limited created entities, and only desires G -d. 3 Nechemia 9:6 4 Kings I, 8:27 5 That is, no limited entity can possib ly contain the essence of G -d, not even in an indirect manner, such as being a “vessel for a vessel”. The doubled terminology of “ Glif Glifu – He engraved an engraving” indicates that the letters which were “engraved” in Kadmon , are not the “letters” of t he Essence of G -d Himself”, but only an engraving of the letters of the Infinite Light which spreads forth from the Essence, called Echad . However, the Essence of the Infinite Light itself, Yachid , which is one with the Essence of G-d, cannot be contained whatsoever. (The concept of a “vessel for a vessel” will be explained later in the book.) This verse was stated by King Solomon at the completion of the erection of the Holy Temple. He said, “The heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain yo u, but this house will?” As explained previously, all created existence is literally equal and nothing before G -d. Furthermore, no effect can ever describe its cause. It is only G - d, the “cause of all causes” who can choose to reveal the Essence of Hims elf in whatever way He desires. It is only because G -d chose to reveal His Essence in the Holy Temple and in the Torah and the Commandments that it is at all possible. This is because He is not limited by the limitations of limited beings. Therefore, al though it is impossible to grasp G - d’s essence through our own efforts, no matter how great those efforts are, nonetheless, it is quite possible and not at all difficult for G -d to reveal His Essence to anyone and anything, should He desire to do so."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" This [concept 6 ] is further [emphasized by] the verse , “ Who have I in the h eaven s but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside You ” 7 . “Who have I in the heaven s ” refers to the general encompassing [light] before the Tzimtzum , which is cal led “the heaven s of the heavens.” “There is none upon earth that I desire bes ide You” , refers to the aspect of the Kav V’Chut (Line and Thread), which is the aspect of the general pervading [light] 8 . Now, as is known to those who have done the analysis , there are various different analogies and ways to explain the matter of the Tzimtzum which is called “the empty place”. [However,] they all arrive at one general point; that in order for the Infinite Light to be expressed in a limited way, in the aspect of a line 9 , it was necessary for Him to restrain His essential light, so that i t w ould remain concealed in His Essence. [Th is is necessary , so that ] not all of it would shine forth, but only a n infinitesimal amount. This is in order that the light could afterwards be drawn down [into revelation] in [a way of] a qualitative leap of [diminished] value 10 . This is analogous to the brilliance of a deep and broad concept [as it exists in the] essence of the teacher. In order for him to draw [this concept] to the student , who is not [intellectually] comparable to him, the teacher must con ceal the entire depth of his comprehension within himself , so that all that is left is but an a spect of an impression , which is like a single point from all the depth and breadth. This is not to say that [his understanding] was com pletely withdrawn and co ncealed. R ather , it is like one who relates a teaching in a brief way . He has the entire depth and breadth of the logic al arguments in his intellect, o nly that during the time that he states his ruling briefly , they are temporarily included and concealed in his essence. However, as soon as he i s questioned [about it] he can expand on the subject . Only that in order for the student to understand , through this short [ruling], he conceals [the depth and breadth of it] within himself temporarily, as explaine d elsewhere at length 11 . Now, the impression , which remained like a point , is not a complete and true Tzimtzum (withdrawal). [A true and complete Tzimtzum ] would be like one who completely withdraws [revelation] and completely conceals, [in which case] th e s tudent lacks all [revelation]. Rather, [the explanation of] the matter is that included in this short [ruling ] is the entire length. N ot a single thing missing , not even half a thing . This is similar to how the short rulings of the Mishnah included th e entire length of the logical debate of the Talmud . This is [likewise] similar to how the entire logical debate is not concealed from one who kno ws it,   6 Tha t is, the concept of a person realizing the nothingness of all of Creation, and focusing on the Essence of G -d with singular desire and self sacrifice. 7 Psalms 73:25 8 After having addressed the fact that the comprehension of the matter of Tzimtzum is pi votal to the realization of G - d’s True reality and the arousal of desire towards the Essence of G -d alone, the Rebbe will now begin to actually explain the concept of Tzimtzum itself. 9 In other words, in order for there to be a revelation of a single limi ted line of revelation, it was necessary to bring about the matter Tzimtzum . That is, there must be a restraint of the infinite revelation, in order to bring about a finite revelation. This was explained in the previous chapter through the allegory of on e who is attacked by a wild animal (G -d forbid), and will now be explained further. 10 That is, in order for there to be a revelation of finite and limited, it is necessary for there to be a withdrawal of the revelation of the Infinite and Unlimited. 11 See Likutei Torah, Vayikra (in the additions) p.52, c.3 and on. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’I, Vayikra, book 2, page תתקכא and on."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"even while he revi ews it to himself briefly . We find that his knowledge of the length encompasses th e entire revelation of the brief [teaching] , in a concealed way. [However,] it is not completely withdrawn, as [in the case of] forgetfulness or the like, as is explained elsewhere at length 12 . The second type of analogy, which is the life of t he soul [as it is invested] in the body, also brings ou t the same point as above. This is that in order for there to be a change from the essential spiritual life of the soul, to a [physical] life of flesh, it is necessary for there to be an initial concealment and c ontraction of the light of the soul. This is because there is no comparison between them. Nonetheless, the soul is affected by the occurrences of the body. Therefore, even the light of the physical life [force] is connected and bound with the spiritual light of the essence. This is similar to [how the aforementioned] physical growth is bound to the spiritual power of growth. However, when one’s [physical] limb becomes severed [G -d forbid,] this does not cause a loss to the spiritual light and life forc e of that limb. The proof of this is from [the fact that] a blind person can give bi rth to a whole person, as is known. This [shows that] the spiritual [life force] is merely concealed, but it still exists, hovering over the physical life force of the bo dy. This is called “ Tzelem Ish – The form of man”. This is similar to how the aforementioned [breadth and length of] knowledge which is concealed , [encompasses the brief teaching ] etc. (All of this is explained elsewhere at length.) Likewise, when the s piritual power of movement comes into an [ actual] physical movement, it becomes constrained within itself. Nonetheless, the physical move ment is connected and bound to the spiritual [power of] movement. There are many other examples of this as well, suc h as the matter of having insight into a particular concept , which comes from the power of conceptualization [of his soul], which rests upon him in a concealed [fashion] 13 . However, [we must now] understand the aspect of the Reshimu – Impression, which indi cates the withdrawal of everything into concealment, so that only an impression of everything remains. This is better understood by other analogies and matters. For example, it is like the blueprint 14 that the architect drafts . He is capable of construc ting the [entire] building from the small l ines of the blueprint. T he entire length of the construction is included briefly in the blueprint. Another example [of a Reshimu – impression] is like some one who makes a sign [for himself] as a memory aide. The sign [or mnemonic] has no [actual] relation to the es sence of the matter, but is merely a memory aide, as stated 15 , “ Make signs for yourself ”. This is a much greater concealment than the [aforementioned allegory of one who] teaches the summary of the law, which includes the entire [ logic] within it . [For, in that example] there is at least some relationship between the short summary and the lengthy [explanations].   12 See Likutei Torah, Vayikra (in the additions) p.53, c.3. Also see Sefer HaMa’amarim תרמ \" ז , p.48 13 This means that in order for there to be a particular flash of insight into a particular field of knowledge, it is necessary for there to be a Tzimtzum in his essential power of conceptualization ( Koach HaMaskil ). 14 The Hebrew word for “Impression” is “ Reshimu ”. It is worthy to note that this shares the same root as “Blueprint – Roshem ”. 15 Jeremiah 31:20"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"There is another analogy for this Reshimu – Impression, which implies an even greater Tzimt zum – Restraint and concealment. It is like a person who throws a stone. T he power which propels it is separate from the essence [of the thrower] . Nonetheless, the entire power of movement is invested within [the stone] in a concealed fashion. However, there is a great distance of separation from the essential power [of movement] which is in the hand. In contrast, this is not the case with the power of movement itself, whe n he physically moves him self 16 . [In this case] it is vested within the physical i n a more revealed [manner], as mentioned previously. There is an [analogy of] even greater concealment than this [example of the thrown object], which is similar to the concept of the impression which [one makes] only as a rem inder . This is like when one hints with his hand to a very deep concept or idea. The physical movement is totally separat e from the spiritual thought, bu t nonetheless, the concept is understood through [the movement] . 17 An even greater concealment is how the light of an intellect ual [concept] is [ invested] within the [phy sical ] movements of one ’ s fingers when he writes it down , as explained elsewhere at length. Now, a ll of the above bring out the same point, as mentioned above. This is that the aspect of the essence remains concea led and included within this impression and point. This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Twelve   16 That is, when a person moves his own hand, or if he moves an object in his hand, the aforementioned distance and separateness is absent. In other words, it is directly observable that it he, himself, is moving the object. However, in the case of a thrown object, it is not readily observable who originally propelled the object. Nonetheless, although it is not readily observable, nonetheless, it was thrown by someone. Furthermore, should the thrown object inflict some sort of damage, the thrower of the object whose power of movement was inve sted within it, will be held accountable. So, in the case of a stone that is thrown, he is directly responsible for it, although, to someone who did not witness the original throw, it appears to be propelled independently of the thrower. 17 This is like th e V for victory. This gesture is very meaningful to all who understand its symbolism, especially during times of adversity, but by itself it is nothing more than two fingers held up in the form of a V. It has no real co -relation to the concept being convey ed. Nonetheless, when this gesture was popularized by Sir Winston Churchill during the Second World War, it became a source of great hope and encouragement to millions of people thr oughout the world. This is similar to an analogy of someone who ties a string around his finger as a reminder of something. This little string might bring to mind very deep and profound concepts, but only to one who knows its meaning. The string itself is not at all related to the concepts, for after all, it is only a string."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirteen Now, from all t hat was said before, we can understand the analogue, as it is ab ove [in G-dliness]. This is the general matter of the Tzimtzum which is called the “empty place” and is the aspect of the withdrawal and concealm ent [of His revelation] within Himself, so that afterwards there could be the aspect of an influence of light [in a limited fashion], as mentioned previously. Now, [this revelation] was not completely removed or concealed. Rather, it is like the aforementioned analogy [that when a teacher ] conveys [a teaching] in a brief manner, his knowledge of all the d epth and length becomes concealed within himself. If so, according to this, even after the entire chaining down of the worlds of ABY”A 1 which occupy this “empty place”, the aspect of the concealed light of the essence encompasses and surrounds the entire chaining down of the Kav 2 . Furthermore, just as before the Tzimtzum the light of the Essence filled this entire void and empty space, as stated in Etz Chayim , so too , after Tzimtzum the light of the Essence is present, as it is, in an infinite aspect , lit erally , 3 except that it is not revealed below, relative to the influence [which reaches] the recipients. However, in regard to His Ess ence, there is no change here, whatso ever. This is like the   1 This is an acronym for the worlds Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 2 This refers to the line of limited revelation, as will soon be explained. 3 In other words, just as before the Tzimtzum the Infinite Light filled the entire “void” and “empty” place, so too it fills the “void” and “empty” place after Tzimtzum . The change is only in respect to the recipients. This is like the aforementioned allegory of the teacher. Even when the teacher is teaching in a short and summarized manner, nonetheless, his entire l ength, breadth and depth of knowledge is not concealed from himself, but only concealed to the students, who are the recipients. Likewise above, the Infinite Light is only concealed from us, the recipients, but to G -d it is fully revealed, just as before the Tzimtzum . However, there is a difference between the analogy and the analogue. With regard to a human teacher who is limited, there is a certain change in him, due to the fact that he can only think one thing at a time. In other words, when he is te aching with brevity, his mind must be focused on the short teachings and not on the entire length and breadth of his knowledge. Therefore, there is a certain change in the teacher, from totally revealed to somewhat concealed. That is, there is a certain amount of concealment to himself as well. So even though his knowledge was not actually, totally removed, it did change from a revealed state to a concealed state. However, this is not the case in the analogue, i.e. in G -d, who is infinite. Because He is not limited as man is, there is no concealment at all in relation to him. It is only in relation to us, the recipients, that there is concealment. To G -d, there is no concealment whatsoever. Just as the light of His Essence filled the entire “empty sp ace” before the Tzimtzum , so too, it fills the entire “empty space” after Tzimtzum ."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"analogy of a person who knows the entire length [of a concep t], [so that] even while he is teaching his student in a brief way, if questioned, he can immediately respond [at length] . 4 How ever , the verse 5 , “He sets darkness as his hiding place ”, and the statement of the Sages 6 , “ At first there was darkness [and the n light returned]”, is only speak ing in rega rd to [Creation ] below. This is because [C reation] is drawn only from the aspect of the Reshimu (Impression) that remained after the aforementioned concealment . 7 This then is the meaning of 8 “You are holy, and Y our name”, i.e. the essential light, “is Holy” and remo ved [from C reation] . 9 Similarly, [it states 10 ,] “You are He before [the creation of the world, and You are He after the creation of the world]” , 11 and as stated, “I HaShem have not changed” 12 . This is b ecause, that which He afterwards “reveals deep things out of [the ] darkness” 13 and concealment , through the radiance of the Kav , 14 specifically [comes] from the same Essential Light which precedes the Tzimtzum . 15 This is the meaning of “You are He”, as is k nown . 16   4 See previous footnote for the difference between the allegory and the analogue. 5 Psalms 18:12 6 See (Rashi) Tractate Shabbat 77b. 7 That is, the recipients and all of Cr eation, only receive from the impression which remains after the Tzimtzum . Therefore, in relation to created entities, the Infinite Light is concealed. However, in regard to the essence of G -d which precedes the Tzimtzum , there is no concealment whatsoev er. Therefore, this verse and the statement of the Sages, do not speak in reference to the Essence of G -d, but rather they speak only from the angle of created entities. However, in regard to the Essence of G -d, which precedes the Tzimtzum , it states, “I HaShem have not changed”. 8 See the Amidah prayer. 9 In other words, it is completely concealed from the perspective of the recipients. 10 See the morning prayers. 11 This statement clearly indicates the fact that the Essence of G -d, and His Essential Light , remain totally unaffected by the creation of the worlds. As explained above, the effected changes are only from the angle of the recipient. 12 This verse once again indicates that the Essence of G -d and His Infinite Essential Light are unaffected by crea tion. 13 Job 12:22. The “darkness” refers to the Tzimtzum – Withdrawal (of revelation to the recipients) and the Reshimu – Impression. The “revelation” is the revelation of the Kav – the Line of the entire chaining down of the worlds (which will soon be e xplained). 14 This refers to the line of revelation which follows the Tzimtzum , including the entire chaining down ( Hishtalshelut ). 15 In other words, the existence of the entirety of Creation does not pose a contradiction to His absolute unity, and perfecti on, for it is not something new which was not included there. This is because, what follows the Tzimtzum in revelation, comes from the same essential light which preceded the Tzimtzum . For example, when a teacher desires to teach a student, whose compreh ension is not equal to his own, he must make a Tzimtzum . That is, he must first gather the entire length and breadth of his understanding of the subject in his mind, arriving at the essential point which he desires to give over. This is a Tzimtzum , and the point which remains is a Reshimu . When he then begins to explain the teachings according to the capacity of the student , he is in truth drawing from the essential light of his intellect before his Tzimtzum . However , now, it is drawn out in a limited f ashion according to the capacity of the student. Nonetheless , in the mind of the teacher there was no diminishment whatsoever, and it is literally the same essential light as before the Tzimtzum . The explanations which he draws from there were included t here all along in a Heyulie fashion. The limitation and lack of revelation or awareness is only with respect to the recipient, who receives and perceives only the short explanations. See also footnote 3. 16 The word “You” is spoken in the second person an d indicates that the person being spoken about is present.

This is because it is not yet within the definition or category of an influencing light altogether , so much so , that it cannot even be [considered] an aspect of “encompassing [light]” 17 . Rather, it is the li ght of the Essence , which is the aspect of His [G - d’s] revelation, as He essentially is. 18 For this reason we say 19 , “ He endures and His name endures” . 20 Likewise, [the statement ,] “ Blessed is He and B lessed is His name ”, and the like , refer only to the “ letters” which He “engraved” in the “upper purity”, which is what H e estimated w ithin Himself in potenti al. 21 Moreover, [after Tzimtzum ] t his [impression ] too, remain s in a way of slig ht concealment and withdrawal.

This is used to refer to the Essence of G -d and the Infinite Light, as it precedes the Tzimtzum which is not presently revealed . However, the meaning of the statement, “You are He”, is that even after Tzimtzum there is still o nly one existence. In other words, the “You” that is revealed after Tzimtzum is the same as the “He” which precedes the Tzimtzum , for there is nothing outside of G -d. 17 This is to say that the light of the Essence cannot be considered to be an “encompass ing” light, which “encompasses” and “surrounds” something internal (or external) to it. For, the reality of the light of G - d’s Essence is the reality of G -d Himself, i.e. his absolutely singular existence (as previously explained in ch.10 -11). So, althou gh it encompasses all of C reation, it does not encompass it like a “ Makif L’Pnimi – An encompassing light which encompasses an inner light.” 18 This is to say that it is the revelation of the absolute singularity of G -d, as He is in His Essence. As explain ed in the previous footnote, this negates the concept of “ Makif L’Pnimi ”, something which encompasses something internal (like one circle within another). Rather, there is only one existence. 19 See morning prayers, Emet VeYatziv... 20 This statement again i ndicates that He and “His Name” – The Essential Light – remain completely unaffected by Creation. For example when a person makes a movement, this does not diminish his essential power of movement in any way, nor does it affect any change there whatsoever . Furthermore, as explained previously, the essential power of movement cannot be called “movement” at all, since firstly, it is not separate from the essential self, and secondly, it is not at all in the category of “movement”. Nonetheless, we must stil l say that the movement came from there, for otherwise, where did it come from ? 21 The Hebrew word “ Baruch – Blessed” also means to draw down, as in, “ Hamavrich Et HaGefen – to draw down the vine”. Therefore, the statement, “He is blessed and His name is b lessed” indicates that G -d does indeed lower Himself into Creation. This seems to contradict what we stated above, that “He is holy and His name is holy” and removed from Creation. However, the Rebbe here explains that the revelation within Creation is o nly drawn from the aforementioned “letters” which were “engraved” in the “upper purity”. In other words, this is not a revelation of the Essence of G -d to the recipients, but rather, they only receive what He estimated within Himself in potential. That i s, the influence is limited to what is necessary for the chaining down of the worlds, and not according to G - d’s infinite ability to create. 22 To understand this, let us return to the analogy of the teacher and student. When the teacher proceeds to teach the student, the first thing he must do is withdraw the entire length and breadth of his knowledge, leaving only the point which he desires to convey to the student. Now, even this point does not remain in his mind according to his own capability and und erstanding of it, but rather, it is specifically according to what is necessar y for the student. However, this in no way detracts from the essential understanding of the teacher, and is only a concealment relative to the recipients. Likewise above, altho ugh the impression includes the entire Infinite Light, it is in a state of concealment to the recipients. All that is revealed is an impression of the “letters” of estimation within the Essence, of that which is necessary for the chaining down of the worl ds. However, this does not at all cause change or detract from the Essence or the Light of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" Likewise, [this may be understood] according to the second analogy mentioned above, of the life force of the so ul in the bo dy, in that it change s from spiritual existence to physical existence.

[This is true] even though [after Tzimtzum ] it is [revealed] only according to the capacity of the chaining down [of the worlds] . For, [although] there is a connection and bond between them , 25 nonethe less, according to this analogy 26 the Tzimtzum of the light into a [finite] line [of revelation] does not cause any change at all in the light of the Essence. This is , likewise , the case according to the third analogy of the physical [movement ] which com es from the [spiritual] power of movement ( Koach HaTnoo ’ah ), 27 or [similarly ], according to the afor ementioned analogy of the insight ( Chochmah ) which comes from the power to       the Essence itself, as in the analogy above. It is from this impression that the line of limited revelation is drawn forth to create the worlds (as will soon be ex plained). 23 That is, there is no change in the essence of the soul and its essential light. 24 For example, although a blind person may be physically lacking the faculty of sight, his soul is not lacking in this. This is evident from the fact that he can f ather a child who does possess the faculty of sight. 25 This is to say, the limited ray of revelation which follows Tzimtzum is bound and connected to its source, which is the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum . It is like a finite revelation of a particul ar, from an infinite Heyulie power. The essential Heyulie power is unaffected and undiminished by particular revelation. So, although the particular revelation is totally bound with the Heyulie ability which is its source, it does not affect it in any wa y whatsoever. This is may be understood from the above example of a blind person who fathers a seeing child. 26 Referring to the analogy of the life of the spiritual soul as it is vested in the physical body. 27 In other words, when one draws out a limited physical movement from his spiritual and essential Heyulie ability for movement, the limited physical movement is completely bound with the essential Heyulie ability for movement. Furthermore, it is exactly according to his estimation for the entire act, which he made within himself before he actually moved. Nonetheless, there is no change or diminishment whatsoever in his essential Heyulie ability for movement itself, and therefore no change in his essence. Likewise above, the entire chaining down of t he worlds is like a single line of movement, and is according to the “letters” of the estimation which G -d made within Himself. Nonetheless, this limited revelation in no way affects or causes any change in His Essence, or in His Essential Light, and does not diminish it in any way whatsoever. See also footnote 20 of this chapter."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskil ). 28 All these [analogies] arrive at the same point , 29 as explained before at length. This will suffice for those of understanding. 30 Now, it was explained above that the aspect of the Impression ( Reshimu ) is like a summary which includes the entire length within it . From this it is understood that above , [ in G- dliness], this is the “Power to Limit” ( Koach HaHagbalah ) which exists in the Infinite Light, which is essentially unlimited 31 . In other words, [He has the ability] to bring the entire radiance of the Essential Limitless Light , into an aspec t of limitation. This is the matter of the Impression ( Reshimu ), within which the entire Essence of the Infinite Light is includ ed in a limited fashion, similar to the analogy of the brief summ ary which includes the whole [concept] within it . This is pos sible because G -d, blessed be He, is all powerful , and [therefore] also includes the power to limit ( Koach HaMagbil ). [He can therefore] limit and include the entire Essential Light in a single impression, as explained elsewhere at length. However, actua lly, [the above] is not an accurate analogy for the aspect of the Impression ( Reshimu ) that remained in the aforementioned “void” and “empty place”. This is b ecause this [ impression] indicates that ever ything was withdrawn from there . [It does not indicat e] that some light remained , albeit, in a brief and limited fashion . 32 Rather, [in truth], only an impression remained. This being the case, a truer analogy [for the Reshimu – Impression] is [the analogy] of the short lines an d signs of the blueprint that architects draft, which includes the entire length of   28 When one has a flash of insight into a particular subject from his essential Heyulie ability to conceptualize concepts, although this particular flash of insight is bound with this power of the intellect, it in no way affects it or causes any change in it. Rather, it is like a specific movement from the spiritual power of movement, and the other examples above. The analogue is understood, that the Tzimtzum does not affect any changes in the essence of the Infinite Light whatsoever. 29 That is, the Tzimtzum only conceals from the angle of the recipient, but causes no actual change in the Essence of G -d, or in His Essential Light. Therefore, just as prior to Creation He was one and alone, so too, from His angle, after creation He is still one and alone. Furthermore, just as His Essential Light radiated before Tzimtzum , it likewise radiates without any change at all, after Tzimtzum . The purpose of man is to truly grasp this matt er, as mentioned previously. 30 Now that the Rebbe has given the explanations of the analogies of the previous chapter concerning the Tzimtzum , he will continue with the explanations of the analogies for the matter of the Reshimu – impression which remained . 31 It is explained here and elsewhere that G -d, who is truly unlimited, having no limitations whatsoever, also possesses the power and ability to limit and reveal Himself in a limited fashion. Furthermore, this itself gives greater insight into G - d’s o mnipotence. That is, He is not limited to the “unlimited”, but to Him the infinite and the finite are literally equal, and He is beyond them both. However, it is specifically the expression of His Self in a limited fashion, which informs us of this, shed ding light upon the greatness of G- d’s omnipotence. 32 The analogy above for an “Impression” which is like the brief teachings of the Mishnah which contain the entire length and breadth of the logical debate of the Talmud, is not a good analogy for the conc ept of Reshimu – Impression. This is because although the Mishnah is like a summary which includes the entire length, there is , nonetheless , some light in the teachings of the Mishnah itself. In other words, the Mishnah isn’t a total concealment, but act ually retains some light in a revealed way. However, the Reshimu – Impression indicates a complete withdrawal of all light and revelation so that only an “impression” remains. As was explained in the previous chapter, this is better understood through ot her analogies, such as the analogy of a blueprint, or of one who makes a “sign” or “mnemonic” for a certain concept etc. In these examples (which will shortly be explained) there is actually a complete concealment of the entire light. Nonetheless, it is all included there in a concealed way."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"the construction of the building . 33 An even greater [ example of concealment ], is [the analogy of a person who makes ] a sign for remembrance, as previously explained .

An even greater [example of] concealment and withdrawal is like the aforementioned anal ogy of one who throws a stone. Similarly , it states in Sefer HaBahir 36 , “It is as if it was thrown” etc. This is because the aspect of the Reshimu – Impression remains separate and distant from the essential light 37 . This powe r which is concealed within the impression ( Reshimu ) is call ed the aspect of the “concealed light ” , which is separate from the concealed Essen tial Light of the Infinite. This is similar to the separate force concealed in a thrown stone . [The force which propels the stone ] comes from the power [of movement] of the hand, which already become s concealed within the self [once the stone leaves his hand] . (This is comparable to all the stars and planets whose orbit is [c ause d] by the hidden G-dly power of movement which comes about in an aspect of a “throw ” from the li ght and G -dly force of the nine external vessels of Malchut of Asiyah . Th is [G-dly force which propels them] is a “separate force”, and is called the aspect of Malchut of Malchut , which comes out as separate and distant [from its source].

These are [examples of] a revelation of the essential power in [a way of] closeness and is called the aspect of Malchut , as explained elsewhere at length. 38 )   33 In this analogy, there is no actual “light” or “building” in the blueprint. One cannot reside within a blueprint. Nonetheless, to a person who knows how to read it, and certainly to the one who drew it, the entire length and breadth of the building, down to the finest detail, is known. 34 Psalms 145:7 35 As will later be explained the Infinite Light is compared to the attribute of Kindness - Chessed , whose nature is to spread forth in revelation. (This is in contras t the aspect of Tzimtzum , which represents the attribute of Might – Gevurah , and restraint.) This verse, therefore, indicates that only a “remembrance” of this “kindness” (the Infinite Light) remained after the Tzimtzum . This is an even better analogy fo r the aspect of the Reshimu – Impression, which indicates a complete concealment of the Essential Light of G -d, with only an “impression” or “remembrance” of this “kindness” remaining. 36 Sefer HaBahir – The Book of Brilliance is one of the earliest Kabbala h texts, written by the great Sage, Rabbi Nechunia Ben HaKana. See also Shmot Rabba, ch. 13. 37 In other words, a stone which is thrown is separate from the thrower of the stone, yet nonetheless contains within it the strength of the thrower, and even more than this, it contains his very essence. This is so much so that he himself is directly responsible for any damage incurred by the stone. Similarly, from the angle of the recipients, the physical universe appears to have been “thrown” and separate from its “thrower”. That is, from the angle of the recipients, this type of Reshimu – Impression leaves room for the recipients to perceive themselves as separate entities from the “thrower”. (However, even with this type of Reshimu – Impression, it is certai nly perceivable that there is a “thrower”, and that the universe did not bring itself into being. However, one may erroneously think that the universe exists on its own, like the stone which is separate from the “thrower”.) Nonetheless , this is only from the perspective of the recipients. I n truth, the universe does not exist outside of G - d, and all “apparent” changes are only in the perception of the recipients, rather than the influencer. This was previously explained in regard to the Tzimtzum . 38 The contents of this parenthesis will be discussed and explained later at great length, in the explanations of Malchut and Malchut of Malchut . However, for the sake of clarity it must be pointed out that this perception of “separateness” and “distance” is onl y from the angle of the recipients, as explained previously."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"An analogy which is even closer to this [aspect of Impression - Reshimu ] is like how an intellectual concept is concealed and hinted at th rough a physical motion [of the hand ]. 39 This is call ed the aspect of “investment ” o r “containment” within a separate matter 40 . This is, likewise , the case when a person writes , [so that] the intellect and wisdom [are invested in] the movements of his fingers , as mentioned previously.

That is , though it comes in an aspect of complete wit hdrawal, so that all that remains in it is [just] an aspect of total brevity 42 and “hint ing ” 43 or [something] like a separate power 44 , in a way of great brevity, nonetheles s, all the particulars in the [entire] chaining down of the Kav – line [of limited revelation] come out of, and are drawn from this Reshimu – Impression itself. This is because of [the fact] that this Reshimu – Impression includes everything within it, al beit in a concealed manner. It is for this reason that [afterwards] everything can come into revelation, through the aspect of the Kav – Line, until the end of Asiyah (the world of Actualization) 45 . This is like the statement, 46 “ All of creation is not con cealed from You”. I t say s “You” , specifically 47 . This is [to indicate] that everything   39 This is like the aforementioned analogy of Sir Winston Churchill’s famous “V” sign for “Victory” etc. 40 This is also similar to the investing of a deep intellectual concept into an allegory. I n truth, the allegory itself has nothing to do with the concept, and is merely like a “separate garment” to it. However, when it “fits” properly, one is capable of grasping the deep concept by means of the analogy which “enclothes” it. Therefore, althoug h all the “light” of the concept itself is withdrawn, it is still there, concealed within the “separate garment” of the allegory. 41 In other words, a single one of these allegories itself is not sufficient to convey every aspect of the matter of the Reshim u – Impression. Nonetheless, each analogy presents a certain facet, and through all of the analogies together one may come to understand the matter of the Reshimu – Impression. (The usage of more than one analogy to convey each facet of a whole concept h as already been explained in chapter three. Also see R’ Hillel Paritcher’s explanations of chapter three.) 42 This is like the allegory of the blueprint, within which the entire length of the construction is included in a short and summarized manner. This analogy brings out the point that in the Reshimu – Impression, the entire infinite light is included there, albeit in an absolute “summary” and concealed fashion. Nonetheless, it is all there. 43 This is like the allegory of one who makes a mnemonic or hi nts with his hands at a much deeper intellectual concept. In this allegory, it is as if the deep concept becomes vested within the hint, which itself has no actual relation to the concept. Another similar analogy for this can be drawn from a person who t ies a string to his finger to remind him of something. The entire concept is contained within the string, even though the string is a completely separate matter from the concept, so that when he glances at the string it immediately brings the concept to m ind etc. This analogy brings out the point that the Reshimu – Impression itself, bears no resemblance to the Infinite Light of the Essence itself, bu t nonetheless contains the entirety of it. 44 This is like the allegory of one who throws a stone or any ot her object. From this allegory we can see how the Reshimu – Impression, and what follows it, can appear to be “separate” from the “thrower”. (However with regard to the actual Reshim u, in truth it only appears separate from our angle, but not from G- d’s a ngle, as explained above). 45 In other words, every particular that was ever created or ever will be created, in the highest spiritual realms, or in our physical world, was included in this Reshimu – Impression. As will soon be explained, it is from this Reshimu that the band of limited revelation ( Kav ) is drawn. 46 See Zichronot blessing of the Musaf prayer of Rosh HaShanah . 47 In other words, although this Reshimu – Impression contains everything in a completely concealed way, this concealment is only in re gard to the recipients. For example, when one ties a string to his finger as a reminder, although its meaning is completely concealed to everyone else, to himself it is not concealed at"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"is done [by] and drawn into revelation according to how it arose in His simple desire, in the essential light which preceded the Tzimtzum . [That is, according to] how H e estimated within Himself. For, with this primal thought which He estimates within Himself, “ He sees and gazes at everything in one glance ” 48 . That is, [He sees] that which is hidde n and concealed in the brevity and “hint” of the Reshimu 49 . This is analo gous to the architect’s blueprint. It is specifically from this [blueprint], that he will know [how] to make all the particular details of the entire length of the actual construction, from beginning to end. However, in order that he will not forget his [original] reasoni ng and considerations due to the length iness of the subject, he drafts a blueprint as a reminder. In this way he will not veer from [his original intent] and he will not have to rethink [the matter] within himself , anew. This is , likewis e, the case in the matter of making mnemonics for a deep study within himself . These are beneficial to him, in [the fact] that through them, he [is reminded and] knows the entir e length of the analysis of the depth within himself, so that he will not stra y from [his reasoning] etc. Likewise, this aspect of the Reshimu – Impression , within which the entire light of the Essence is concealed and included in the way of a “summary” or “hint”, is itself the source for the drawing down of the Kav V’Chut 50 . [It i s the sou rce both] of the aspects of the encompassing [lights] and the pervading [lights, of the entire C reation,] from beginning to end 51 . This is so that everything should be [created exactly] as it arose in His simple desire and wisdom, in the Essence o f the Infinite Light, literally. This is the meaning of t hat which is stated elsewhere, that a point contains two opposites, conc ealment and revelation. It is concealment relative to everything above it, [but, on the other hand] all revel ation to the rec ipi ents comes about specifically from it. This [revelation] is the aspect of the Kav – Line, which is drawn from the Reshimu – Impression 52 . [The Kav – Line] is in the shape of [the letter] Vav ( ו ), which begins as a Yud ( י ) and is drawn down , as explained elsewhere at length 53 .       all. Likewise, although to us (the recipients) this Reshimu is a tot al concealment (even though it contains everything), to the Essence of G -d there is no concealment whatsoever. 48 See tractate Rosh Hashanah 18a. 49 In other words, He sees everything. 50 This is the term for the limited line of revelation which is drawn fro m the Reshimu , as will be explained in the following chapter. 51 This will be explained later on, in chapter sixteen. 52 As mentioned before, the Reshimu is like a point which remains after Tzimtzum . The reason it is compared specifically to a point is be cause a point indicates complete withdrawal into itself, as opposed to a line which indicates downward revelation. As will be explained, although a point and a line are two opposites; concealment and revelation, nonetheless, a line is drawn specifically f rom a point. 53 In other words, the Reshimu – Impression is like the letter Yud ( י ) which is a point. The Kav – Line of limited revelation is like the Vav ( ו ), whose beginning is a Yud ( י ). The fact that a line is drawn from a point gives insight into how the Kav is drawn from the Reshimu . Therefore, this Reshimu contains two opposites. It is conceals everything above it, but nonetheless, is the source of revelation to that which is below it."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Through all of the above , the general matter of the Tzimtzum [which is called] the “empty place”, and the aspect s of the Reshimu and the Kav , may be understood.

This then is the meaning of [the verse], “With You is the source of life, [in Your light is seen light”. That is,] from Your essential light there is s een a [secondary] “offspring” light, which is the aspect of the Kav , as will be explained with the help of G -d. Now , the entire purpose of man is the deep contemplation of this matter, and the like. It is specifically through this , that he will come to True Unity, binding his soul to the supernal life of all li ves , which is ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) the Essence of the Infinite Light, literally, for the above mentioned reason 55 . This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Thirteen   54 This is like the aforementioned analogy of the teacher stude nt relationship. For example, a great teacher who is teaching young children does not teach the subject matter in the way he understands it. Rather, he limits himself, so that he only reveals in a very restricted form. Nonetheless, his entire purpose in teaching is not for “constriction” but actually for revelation. Furthermore, ultimately, his desire is not that the student s should understand only the “con stricted” teaching, but that their grasp should be equal to his own etc. Li kewise, the ultimate i ntent in C reation is for the revelation of G -dliness, as opposed to its concealment. This is true even though it appears that “concealment” is in effect. In the example above, were the great teacher to teach the children accor ding to the way he understands the subject , it would be beyond the capacity of the students, and would actually be total concealment. Likewise, if G -d revealed everything at once, it would be absolutely beyond us, and would actually be the ultimate concea lment. 55 This is a reference to the beginning of chapter twelve."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Fourteen We must now understand the aspect of the Line and Thread ( Kav V’Chut ), which is drawn from the aspect of the aforementioned Reshimu , in a particular manner . Firstly, we must understand the general matter of [the Kav – Line]; that it is the literal opposite of the aspect of the aforementioned Reshimu – Impression. This is because a point 1 indicates the concealment and withdrawal of everything, so that only a single point remains. Moreover, this point or impression specific ally indicates an aspect of the absence of spreading forth below. In other words, the matter [of a point] is th e absence of extension and revelation to a length and width. This is like the form of the letter Yud 2 ( י ) which has no inner space , as is known. Now, regarding the matter of the tzimtzum of [the Reshimu ] from above, in other w ords, that [everything] remains in the aspect of a point alone, it is possible that its opposite 3 can come from this. This is bec ause, the result of the [ Tzimtzim ] is that everything becomes included in the [ Reshimu ] in a brief and “hinted” manner, and the like. On the contrary, this is the main cause of all revelation of influence [from the Reshimu ], as mentioned previously . 4 Howev er, at first glance, the fact that this point indicates a complet e absence of spreading forth below , certainly could be considered to be a complete and true Tzimtzum . [That is,] it completely hid es and conceals, making it impossible for light to come and [be revealed] below. This being the case, how is it possible that the opposite [of this point], which is the draw ing down and spreading forth of the Kav – li ne, can be drawn from it ?   1 As mentioned in the previous chapters, the Reshimu – Impression is compared to a point, in which there is a complete withdrawal, with no extension or revelation outward. In contrast, the Kav is a thin band of limited revelation which is drawn from the Reshimu . At first glance, these seem to be opposites. A point represents total withdrawal, while a line signifies revelation. 2 The Reshimu – Impression is compared to the letter Yud ( י ) which is the shape of a point. In contrast, the Kav is compared to the letter Vav ( ו ) whose beginning is a Yud ( י ). 3 i.e. revelation, which is the opposite of concealment. 4 The Rebbe begin by posing a question. How is it that the revelation of the Kav can come out of its opposite, which is the total conc ealment of the Reshimu . However, the fact that the Reshimu contains the entire Infinite Light within it in the form of a short, “hinted” summary, resolves the difficulty. On the contrary, it is specifically because of this that revelation can take place . This is the main point of this paragraph. However, in the next paragraph the Rebbe points out the fact that this Reshimu indicates a complete concealment, like a point, which does not extend into revelation, whatsoever. How, then, is it possible that a line ( Kav ) of revelation should be drawn from the complete concealment of a point ( Reshimu )?"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" Rather, as is known, the [expl anation of the] matter is that , in truth , a point and a line are not two opposites, for a line is drawn from a point, and by the joinin g of many points , a line is made . Rather, th e [explanation of the] matter, as is known, is that a point is like a Heyulie 5 relative to a line ( Kav ). It [therefor e] is similar to every [type] of Heyulie or s imple substance. [This is to say that] though it [itself] is specifically the absence of spreading forth , nonetheless, this is not a necessary imperative altogether , 6 but is , rather, only because the essential n ature of a Heyulie is that, as of yet, it is higher than [being in] an aspect o f spreading forth. Therefore, it has not [yet] descended from its essential state . [For example, ] this is like the Heyulie – ability [of the soul] of an animal to enliven [the body] in a reve aled fashion, as this [ability] is still included within its essence, and has yet to spread forth to enliven [the body] . Similarly, it is like the Heyulie power of movement as it is in the essence, before it spreads forth to [actually] move . This is likewise like the [essential] power of growth before it spreads forth to [ cause actual] growth . The same [is true of the essen tial] power of the intellect before it spreads forth to [actually ] conceptualize, and there are many other matters sim ilar to this. It is , therefore , understood that this absence of spreading forth , can not be called a true Tzimtzu m, in and of itself 7 . On the contrary, all [subsequent] revelations and spreadi ng forth [of the line] , exist from this essential Heyulie . 8 In this manner we may understand the aspect of a point relative to a line . [That is ], the lack of spreading forth is only because it is a n essential aspect that, as of yet, is higher than the aspect of “spreading forth”. Now, although [the Reshimu ] comes about through the Tzimtzum of everything, so that nothing remains except for a single point, as mentioned above, however, this itself indicates   5 A Heyulie is a potentiality which is an ability. That is, it does not have to spread forth into revelation, but if the possessor of the ability so desires, he can bring forth his ability. (This was explained earlier in chapters 2, 10 and 11.) Likewise here, as will be explained, a point is a potential for a line (and likewise, a line is a potential for a plane). 6 For example, when one observes a flint stone, he does not see fire at all. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the flint lacks the ability to bring out fire. In other words, just because, at the moment, the flint is not bringing out fire, it still has the Heyulie ability to do so. 7 In other words , in a point, the lack of spreading forth alone cannot be called a true and complete Tzimtzum . Rather, it is a Heyulie which has not yet come into revelation. This is in accordance with the analogies given by the Rebbe in the previous paragraph. 8 As me ntioned previously, the Kav – Line of revelation of the chaining down (of the worlds) is drawn from the point of the Reshimu . Just because the “point” of the Reshimu has not yet spread forth, we are not forced to say that this is a true and complete Tzimt zum . Rather the point of the Reshimu is only a Heyulie and just like all Heyulie powers, the fact that they are not necessarily spreading forth into revelation does not mean that they are lacking this ability and cannot spread forth. Rather, it is from t he essential Heyulie itself that all revelation comes. For example, just because one is not moving, we do not say that he lacks the power of movement. He does indeed possess the power of movement, but for the time being his power of movement is completel y within its Heyulie potential, and is not spreading forth into revelation. Moreover, when he finally does move, it is from this same essential Heyulie which was withdrawn into itself that this movement comes into revelation."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" that the entire aspect of the essence is included in it. Since this is the case, it therefore does not spread f orth downward . 9 This is analogous to a student who i s in the presence of his teacher. As long as he is preoccupied with absorbing [the teachings] and is [focused], similar to a point, with a concentration ( Tzimtzum ) of his whole essence, he cannot “give out” by influencing his fellow [student, with explanations of the teachings] . However, after he has received [the teachings], the opposite is true. [Then,] it is from this very Tzimtzum , in which he was [focused in ] the aspect of a point, that influence to his fellow [student] 10 spreads forth and is drawn out , as explained elsewhere. From all this we understand that the line which is extends from the point is just like the aspect of spreading forth from an essential Heyulie . However, [in regard to ] the fact that it is drawn out in an aspect of a “short line ” , it is explained elsewhere that just as a point is the aspect of a Heyulie relative to a line, likewise, a line is the aspect of a Heyulie relative to the aspects of the length and breadth of a plane . 11 As is known , although the Kav comes with a drawing down and spreading forth from ab ove downward , nonethele ss, it is not [yet] a specific manner of drawing down [or revelation] whatsoever. Rather, it is only that the light has been drawn down from abov e to below . 12 It is through this that the aspects of “above” and “below”, from influe ncer to recipient, comes about. This is not the case in regard to the Heyulie of a point, in which there is no up or down , beginning, middle, or end, as known. (This i s the [meaning] of the statement in Etz Chaim, 13 that the whole essential [purpose of the] radiance of the Kav is solely to b ring about the aspects of “up” and “down ” 14 , as will be explained.) This [ Kav ] is analogous to a “Builder’s R od ”, which is not [coun ted] in to the measurements of the length and width of the area of the building , itself . 15 Nonetheless, with [the builder’s   9 The example for this will n ow be given by the Rebbe. It is like a student who is receiving from his teacher. During this time he must be completely focused like a point, and cannot be thinking any other thoughts or even analyze the teachings. Likewise, during that time he cannot be relating the teachings to his fellow student. Rather, his entire being must be completely focused on the teacher. Furthermore, complete focus indicates that his whole being is invested into this. However, it is specifically because of this focus that he is capable of relating the teachings to his fellow student, afterwards. If he was not entirely focused like a “point”, while he was receiving the teachings, he will not be capable of relating them to his fellow student etc. 10 In other words, it is onl y because he was completel y invested into the subject, like a point, that he is afterwards capable of drawing out explanations to his fellow student. If he was not invested like a point, then he would be incapable of drawing forth influence etc. We see t hen that the revelation of the line, which follows the point, comes specifically because of the focus of the point. 11 In other words, as soon as there are two points there is already a line. This is the case even though the line is very short. This shor t line already represents an expression from the essential Heyulie of a point, and is no longer a point. Nonetheless, this short line is not yet a specific revelation to the recipient. Rather, all it does is create the dimensions of “up” and “down”, and makes the relationship of an “Influencer” and a “Recipient” possible. The Rebbe will now begin to explain the aspect of this short line, which is the Heyulie for all subsequent revelations, and is called the Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line. 12 This is t o say that it is only the first extension of expression from the point of the Reshimu. 13 See Etz Chaim , Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1, Anaf 2. 14 Clearly, this statement of the Etz Chaim refers to this primal aspect of the Kav – Line of Revelation, which is known as the Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" rod, the builder] measures all the measurement s of the length and width [of the building]. [However, the builder’s rod] itself is on ly like a short line, but it includes all possible measurements of length and width . 16 Likewise, the form of the Kav – Line is an aspect of a Heyulie relative to the expanse of the letters and gives them their length and width, such as the lines of the let ter Beit ( ב ), as stated elsewhere . 17 According to this, even the beginning of the extension of the line from the point, although it come s in an aspect of spreading forth and drawing down, nonetheless, it is still an aspect of a Heyulie , which i ncludes many different ways that a length and width may be drawn out within measure. This is why it is called the Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line, as is known. This is indicated by i ts form, which is essentially short, and merely issues forth from above to below. N onetheless, included within this issuance is everything which was concealed in the Heyulie of the point, except that it [now] comes in a way of being drawn down . This [ability] comes from the power of the essential light which is concealed in the essen ce of the influencer, before being concentrated ( Tzimtzum ) into a single point . 18 However, now it comes [into revelation] solely by way of a line, and not as it [originally] was i n the essence of the influencer, where it was with the great expanse of the actu al essence. In this Kav – line, the light of the essence only comes according to the capacity of the recipients . 19 However, it nonetheless possesses a likeness t o the light of the essence that is concealed in       15 For example, a ruler or yardstick is not the size of a building. Nonetheless, one is capable of measuring the dimensions of any building with this measuring rod. 16 Similarly, this Kav HaMidah – Measurin g Linemay be understood through the teacher/student relationship. The Kav HaMidah represents the teacher’s ability to “measure” the student. This is to say that before he can begin an actual line of explanation, he must first “measure” exactly how “long” or “broad” the line must be. If he is speaking to his intellectual equal, the line need not be very long, and he does not have to bring the concept down so far. In contrast, if he was teaching young children, the line must be be much longer in order to bring the concept down to their intellectual capacity. It is clear that this “short line” precedes the actual line of explanation and revelation to the recipients, and is only a “measuring line” to “size up” the recipient and assess what he is capable of receiving. 17 That is, one is capable of writing any letter with this line, but it itself does not constitute any of the letters. It is merely a Heyulie – a potential ability to bring about the dimensions of the length and width of a plane. (On another not e, this short line is the potentiality for tangible “letters” of explanation and expression, while it itself is higher and more essential than the “letters” of tangible explanations and expressions.) 18 This ability to bring forth a length of expression and explanation comes specifically from the essential knowledge of the influencer and is totally unified with him. It is not something separate from him, but is an essential ability like any other ability. That is, if he so wishes, he can choose to express himself in the limited revelation of a line. Furthermore, he is capable of bringing this depth down, even to the comprehension of a child. This is specifically because he comprehends the concept essentially, as explained in chapter two. Likewise here, r egarding the Kav HaMidah , it is an essential ability of G -d, that since He is all -capable and possesses an essential knowledge of Himself, He is therefore capable of expressing Himself in a limited fashion. 19 As in the analogies given previously, were the teacher to express his knowledge according to his own understanding of the subject, he would not be revealing anything to a recipient who is not on his level of knowledge or intellectual capabilities. On the contrary, it would actually be concealing knowl edge, since it would be totally above the “head” of the student. It is specifically this “line of measurement” which allows one to “assess” and “measure” the recipient and formulate a line of expression or explanation that is tailored to the capabilities of any recipient, each student according to his level and capabilities."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" the point , 20 except that it [now] comes [into revelation] in a manner of being drawn down. It therefore comes in the form of a Kav – line. This [ Kav – line] is an aspect of a Heyulie for all the light and influence [given] to the recipients . 21 This will suffice for those of understanding. End of C hapter Fourteen   20 Continuing the previous example, although this is like a lessened explanation, such as an allegory given to a student in order to convey a deep concept, it nevertheless has a similar ity to the essential light of the concept, which it comes to explain. Otherwise the allegory would not “fit” with the concept. Furthermore, it is through this “lessened explanation” and “secondary light” that the student will come to grasp the essential l ight of the essence of the concept itself. 21 Because of the fact that this Kav HaMidah - Line of Measurement, represents the ability to express and reveal influence to any recipient on any level, it itself cannot actually be consid ered to be limited at all. This is to say that, this too, is the same infinite ability of G -d. For, with this line he can reveal Himself on any level, whether it is the highest spiritual level in the highest worlds, or even to us lowly, insignificant and limited creatures. Therefore, this “line” is the Heyulie ability to assess and measure any line of revelation to any recipient. As will be explained in the following chapter, the three aspects spoken about up to this point; the Infinite Light, Tzimtzum & Reshimu , and the Measuring Line, represent three equal abilities in G - d’s essence (although they do follow one from the other). The Infinite Light indicates G - d’s ability to reveal Himself Infinitely, as He is in His essence, the Tzimtzum and Reshimu in dicate G - d’s infinite ability to conceal Himself infinitely and withdraw all revelation completely and the Kav HaMidah – Measuring Line indicates G - d’s infinite ability to reveal Himself on any level between the two extremes of absolute revelation and abso lute concealment, to any recipient on any level."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Fifteen Now, the analogue of all of the above may be understood regarding the aspect of the impression ( Reshimu ) which remained in the aforementioned “void” and “empty space” . 1 This is the aspect of the Heyulie which includes everything that will [afterwards] branch out from it [into revelation] by means of the Kav V’Chut – Line and Thr ead. Now, although all of the Essential Light was concealed until only the aspect of an impression remained, nonetheless, as mentioned above, specifically through this Tzimtzum , everything is certainly included in it in short form. 2 Furthermore, although [ the point of the Reshimu ] indicates the absence of spreading do wn, [nonetheless] this is not a n aspect of total Tzimtzum . 3 It is only because it is an [essential] Heyulie powe r [that it does not spread down ], as explained above. 4 Rather, since it is a power that restrains the entire original light, therefore it does not spread forth except by way of a line, accord ing to the manner [necessary] for in fluence, as mention before . 5 Nevertheless, from the above it is understood that this Kav posses ses the power o f t he original [Infinite] Light which preceded the Tzimtzum . 6 [Furthermore, th is light] is [still] literally in an aspect of Infinity, except that it comes by way of a line, according to the   1 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (This is the Yud of Sa”G of the Upper Purity, as stated in the book Emek HaMelech ). See Emek HaMelech – Shaar: Yud of the name of Sa”G . 2 See chapters 12 and 13, with the explanation of the analogy of the blueprint, and the other analogies given there etc. 3 This is as explained in chapter 14, with the analogy of the stu dent whose entire being is concentrated on receiving the teachings of his teacher. It is because he was entirely focused, like a point, that he can afterwards relate these teachings to his fellow students etc. 4 See chapter 2, 10, 11 & 14, for the explana tion of the nature of a Heyulie power. One of the examples given was the Heyulie ability for movement, before it spreads forth in actual movement. Although at first it was completely withdrawn into itself and totally concealed, this cannot be called a co mplete Tzimtzum , for in truth, it is from this Heyulie power itself that all movement comes into revelation. 5 In other words, as previously explained, the Tzimtzum and Reshimu conceal the revelation of the Infinite Light from the recipients in order to al low for the possibility of limited creations. Therefore, the infinite light which is concealed within the subsequent revelation of the Kav only becomes revealed according to the capacities of the recipients, and not according to G - d’s ability to reveal. Nonetheless, the ability to reveal is still completely infinite, and this Kav is therefore infinite as well. It represents G - d’s infinite ability to reveal Himself to any recipient, on any level. This is like the aforementioned teacher/student analogy. When the teacher restrains and concentrates his broad and lengthy knowledge, it is not a true Tzimtzum , for his entire purpose in doing this is to bring out a limited line of explanation which will be understandable to the student. However, in truth, the teacher’s goal is not that the student should only understand this limited line of explanation, but that through this he will ultimately receive and understand the entire knowledge. 6 See chapter 13, footnote 15."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"manner [in which] the recipients [are capable of receiving]. Th rough th is we may understand the statement 7 , “In Your light is light seen ”. [This is a secondary light,] a radiance of a radiance, which is called an “offspring light” . 8 For, [although] after the Tzimtzum the light breaks through 9 by way of a mere line, it never theles s comes from “Your” essential light, since everything is included within the Reshimu , and it is from [the Reshimu ] that the Kav – Line is drawn. [T he Kav ] is an aspect of a Heyulie for all the influence [of the chaining down of the worlds ], and [it ] bring s about the dimensions of “up” and “down ” 10 , as stated in Etz Chaim . 11 For this reason , 12 we may [now] understand the answer to two [seemingly paradoxical] opposites which are found in this Kav - Line. The first [aspect of the Kav ] is that i t has the power to “include the left in the right etc” . 13 This is the aspect of the inter -inclusions and unifications of all the lights which branch out, from Keter of Adam Kadmon until Malchut of Atzilut . 14 It is specifically through [the Kav ] that [it is possible for] a light t o be exchanged into a ves sel which is not its own, such as the light of Chessed – Kindness [being invested in] the vessel of Gevurah – Sternness . 15 This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere at length in regard to the ma tter of the letter Vav ( ו ) of the word VeHanora ( ו הנורא ). 16   7 Psalms 186:2, “With You is the source of life, in Your light is seen light”. 8 This is to say that Infinite Light is not actually seen, but only a secondary “offspring” light which is born of the first Infinite Light is seen. Nonetheless, as will be explained, this secondary light of the Kav is completely bound to the Essence of the Infinite Light, and comes from there. For this reason, the light of the Kav also possesses a certain likeness to the original Infinite Light which precedes the Tzimtzum . 9 The concept of light “breaking through” a barrier ( Masach ) will be explained later on in the book. However, in general it is analogous to one who writes down an intellectual concept on a piece of paper. There is absolutely no actual intellect on the paper, but only a bunch of squiggles of ink on paper. The actual light of the intellect remains concealed in the mind of the author. However, vested within the ink on the paper is a “secondary light” which may be expanded again into actual intellectual light, in the mind of the reader. 10 This is to say that the first extension of the Kav, although it is not yet a particular line of revelation, it creates the dimensions of “above” and “below”, influencer and recipient. Therefore, as explained in the previous chapter, it is a Heyulie for all revelati on, to any recipient on any level. 11 See Etz Chaim , Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1, Anaf 2. 12 That is, because of the fact that this Kav comes from the Essence of the Infinite Light which is concealed within the Reshimu ... 13 See Zohar, beginning of Parshat Korach . 14 This is a reference to the various Partzufim – Statures which are formed through the inter - inclusion’s and unifications of the ten sefirot . These Partzufim (which literally means faces) represent different modes of conducts which are not pure e ssential conducts, but rather, composite conducts. This will be explained at great length later on. 15 An example of the inner light being Chessed – Kindness, but the vehicle and vessel of expression being Gevurah – Sternness may be understood from a fathe r punishing his child in order to prevent him from coming into harms way. For example, if a child runs out into a busy street and the father restrains and punishes him, speaking harsh words, this is an example of the father’s love for his child but it is expressed through its opposite vessel, which is Gevurah - Sternness. The inner light is Chessed – Kindness, while the vessel of expression is Gevurah – Sternness. These two sefirot are diametric opposites. Their unification is only possible because, in t he essence of the soul, they are an absolute inseparable unity (as explained in chapters ten and eleven). Therefore, as explained, this power of the Kav to unify and inter -include the sefirot is only because of the power of the Essence of the Infinite Lig ht which it contains and to which it is bound. 16 This refers to the beginning of the Amida prayer where we say, “ The Great, the Mighty and the Awesome ( הגדול הגבור והנורא )”. It is explained that “The Great – HaGadol ( ) הגדול” is the essential attribute of Chessed , which represents G - d’s ability to spread forth and reveal infinitely. This refers to the Heyulie of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" The second [aspect of the Kav ] is that it is specifically called the “ Measuring Line ”, in that it gives measure to all lights and vessels . 17 This is as we previously explained regarding the matter of the Kav , that it is called “the builders rod”. [Now], a t first glance, this seems to be the opposite of inter -inclusion [and unification] etc. However, [the explanation of] the matter is th at both [ these aspects of the Kav ] are true. Quite the contrary, the [two ] are inter dependent. This i s because the root of this Kav comes from the original power of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ) which preceded the Tzimzum . This is as explained above regarding the matter that “In Your light” , specifically , “light is see n ” , [referring to the light] of th is Kav . Certai nly, it is within the power of the essenti al light of Ein Sof (T he Unlimited One ) to make inter -inclusions and unifications of all opposites throughout the entire chaining down [of the worlds], from the “top ” of Adam Kadmon , 18 until Malchut of Atzilut . This is in accordance with the statement 19 , “ You are He who unifies them and binds them... You are He , inside and out ” . 20 This is also the [explanation of the] matter of “the name of 45 ( Ma”H – מ \" ה ) within, which is the path of the entire Atzilut ” 21 , and there ar e other such statements. All th is [inter -inclusion and unification] is [possible] because of the radiance of the essential light of Ein Sof (The Unlimited One ) which is within this Kav and goes and extends down until Malchut, the end of all the levels [of the world of Atzilut ].       the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ). In cont rast, “The Mighty – HaGibor ( ) הגבור” is the essential attribute of Gevurah , which represents G - d’s ability to restrain all revelation and conceal, absolutely. This refers to the aspect of the Tzimtzum and Reshimu . Now, the third aspect is “The Awesome – VeHaNorah ( .”) והנורא This is a reference to G - d’s infinite ability to reveal in a limited fashion, on every level between the two opposite extremes of absolute Chessed and absolute Gevurah . This is similar to the median conduct of Tiferet , which is a synt hesis of these two opposites: revelation ( Chessed ) and concealment ( Gevurah ). This is the aspect of the Kav - Line, as is indicated by the letter Vav ( ו ) of the word VeHanora ( ו הנורא ). As previously mentioned, the shape of the letter Vav ( ו ) is in the shap e of a Kav – Line. 17 This is to say that it measures all lights and vessels, thus giving them their limits and borders. Clearly, it is this ability which separates one sefirah from the other, by creating borders and definitions. Seemingly, this appears t o be an opposite power from the above power of unification and inter -inclusion, which unifies one sefirah with the other, thus seemingly defying their borders and definitions etc. The Rebbe will now explain this. 18 The concept of Adam Kadmon will be expla ined later, in chapter s 17 and 18. In short, it refers to the first Partzuf – Stature which was emanated. 19 See introduction to Tikkunei Zohar , 17a. 20 G -d is essentially absolutely singular. In the Essence of the Infinite Light the sefirot are totally an d absolutely bound with the singular essence, and are therefore inseparable and indistinguishable from it , as explained in chapters 10 and 11. Furthermore, they are so totally one in essence, that they cannot even be said to be “unified” or “included” wit h each other or even with G - d’s essense . This i s because they are one and the same with the singular Essence of G -d. Because the secondary light of the Kav contains a radiance of this Essential light, and is totally bound to G - d’s Essence, it therefore p ossesses the ability to unify and inter -include the sefirot , thus creating composite modes of conducts ( Partzufim ). This is the meaning of “You are He who unifies them, and binds them...” 21 As previously mentioned, the name of 45 – Ma”H ( מ \" ה ) represents the aspect of the Koach Mah – The power of “what” ( כח מ \" ה ) – which is the aspect of sublimation ( Bitool ) to the Essence of G - d (as in Moshe’s statement, “ V’Nachnu Mah – What are we etc”. It is this sublimation to the Essence of G -d which a llows for inter -inclusion and unity. This is because in G - d’s essence the sefirot are an absolute unity and singularity. Therefore, it is because of the radiance of the Essential Light of G -d within the Kav that there can be inter -inclusion and unificati on of opposite sefirot within the entire C reation."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"It is for this very same reason that it is within the power [of the Kav ] to measure every measurement and limitation. [That is, it measures] all lights and vessel s, and all unifications of “influencer and recipient”, [determining exactly] how much the “masculine waters” and “feminine waters” 22 will be. This [aspect of measurement comes] from the aspect of the Reshimu , which limits all the light of the Essence in va rious manners, according to His estimation within the Ohr Ein Sof (The Essence of the Infinite Light ) before the Tzimtzum . We find that from the angle of the Essential Light in the Kav – Line, it is considered to be an aspect of a Heyulie [the function o f which is] to inter -include and unify everything , [whereas] from the angle of the limiting power of the Reshimu in it, it limit s and gives measure to everything , according to the aspect of the first assessment [and estimation ] which wa s included in this Reshimu . 23 By wa y of analogy, this is similar to an architect who drafts a blueprint, which defines the manner in which the [building will be] built , so that everything should be preci sely according to how he decided within himself of how the measure ments [should be]. [This is done ] so that he should neither stray to the left nor to the right [from his original plan ]. 24 Now, although at times i t is possible for there to be additional radiance in the emanate d [ sefirot ], more so than the dictates of the “measu ring line” ( Kav HaMidah ), this specifically comes about from the power of the Essential Light . At times it will radiate in one way, and at times in another way . 25 For this reason, any aspect of new light [found] within ABY”A 26 comes specifically from Atzmo ot Ohr Ein Sof (The Essence of the Infinite Light ) which precedes the Tzimtzum . This is because it is from His essential li ght , that light is seen within this Kav . At times there is additional [r adiance] and at times there is diminished [radiance]. This also [accounts ] for the changes [which take place] in the unifications of all the Partzufim (Statures) , from [the top of]   22 Masculine waters – Mayin D’churin , represents an arousal and flow of influence from above to below, from influencer to recipient. Feminine waters – Mayin Nukvin , represents an arousal and flow of influ ence from below to above, from recipient to influencer. 23 In other words, the Kav is like a median conduct between the two extremes of the complete revelation of the Infinite Light of the Essence, and the complete concealment of the Tzimtzum & Reshimu . 24 In other words , the limitations and measurements of the Kav are exactly according to the “blueprint” of the Reshimu , which was already estimated and determined within Him, as explained in chapter s 11 and 12. 25 An analogy for this may be drawn from a science teacher wh o creates a lesson plan of exactly what he will teach his students throughout the school year. This lesson plan is a “blueprint” of exactly what will be “revealed” throughout the year. Nonetheless, one day the teacher may decide to break the l esson plan and take his students to NASA. Now, the things that they will see at NASA are completely beyond their young minds and they can neither understand them nor comprehend them, besides the fact that they will not learn what they were supposed to hav e learned that day according to the lesson plan . Nonetheless, by taking the to NASA and revealing these things to them, even though they are above their heads, their interest will become aroused, and they will be excited to learn the subjects that he teac hes them during the rest of the school year. Through going to NASA they mat even be inspired to aspire to become scientists one day, themselves. On a different day, the teacher may decide not to teach his students anything because they we re misbehaving. Instead, the class will have to sit silently and not receive any new lessons from their teacher. Of course, this certainly was not in the original lesson plan. It is nothing but the withholding of all influence. In the same way, it is possible that there may be additional influence in the Kav, over and above the original blueprint of the Reshimu dictated . At other times it is possible for there to be a withholding of influence and revelation, less than the Reshimu originally dictated . 26 This is an acronym for the worlds, Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah ."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Adam Kadmon to the “heel” of Adam Kadmon , at the end of [the world of] Asiyah . 27 An example of this is the change between the time of the Holy Temple to the time of the exile, and the like 28 . More over , we generally [pray and] say, “May it be desirable before Yo u”. [This to say ,] literally before Your Essence, which is even higher than the ten essential sefirot . [We requ est that G -d] sh ould change “T he simple essential desire ” which has already been drawn forth within Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof (The Essential Infinite Light ). [That is, we request that it should be drawn forth] and come into the estimation which He estimated within Himself [for the entire chaining down of the worlds ] until the end of the Kav , in an entirely d ifferent way , such as from Judg ment ( Din ) to Kindness ( Chessed ), and the like 29 . This is as previously explained (at the end of chapter nine) regarding the matter of “I HaSh em have not changed” . [That is,] in the original light which precedes the Tzimtzum there is no change between a desire for kindness or [ a desire for] judgment . 30 [This is] because of the reason mentioned above (in chapter ten) , regarding the matter of th e essential Heyulie desire for kindness, which is completely included in the Essence . 31 [It was previously explained ] that there are three levels unti l it comes to a particular matter , (as explained at length in chapter eleven) . 32 When the Sages stated, “[ Pray] to Him and not to His attributes” this even refers to His essential attributes, which are [one] with the Essential Light. This is because Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof (The Essence of the Infinite Light ) “I s not of any of these attributes altogether” 33 . This will suffice for those of understanding.   27 This means that changes in the Partzufim – “Faces” (Statur es or Personages) which are revealed to us, and the changes in the unifications of these Statures (which will be explained later on in this bo ok) are a direct effect of the radiance of the Essential Light which radiates within the Kav in a limited fashion. 28 In the time of the Holy Temple , G-dliness was openly revealed, while in exile the opposite is true. This is the primary difference between exile and redemption, while all other differences are only side effects of this primary cause. 29 That is, we make our request s directly to G -d, as He is, essentially . This is because, as explained, it is the radiance of His Essence within the Kav in diff erent measures which causes all changes throughout the chaining down of the worlds ( Hishtalshelut ). This is possible for the reason which was explained previously (in chapters 9, 10 & 11), that in His Essence there is no difference between Chessed and Gev urah , for they are essentially one with the Essence itself, which is an absolute singularity and unity. 30 This means that they a re indistinguishable from each other, so that a change in the expression of these attributes and qualities do es not effect a cha nge in His Essence whatsoever. This is because, as previously explained, the Tzimtzum only affects the recipients. Therefore, this Kav which follows the Tzimtzum , also only appears to change from the angle of the recipient. (See chapters 9 and 13). 31 I t was explained in chapter ten that “it is impossible to say about [the Heyulie attribute of Kindness ( Chessed )] that it “unifies” with the Heyulie attribute of Netzach – Conquest, which is [also] embedded in the essence of the soul. This is because the t wo are both absolutely united with the essence, and are not at all separate from the self.” 32 This is a reference to the three levels explained previously, Yachid, Echad and Kadmon . The light undergoes these three stages before it can be expressed as a pa rticular expression. 33 This is to say that although He includes all of these attributes within Him, in essence, He is above and beyond any of these qualities and is not defined by them. Rather, it is He who defines them and brings them forth, out of His e ssen ce and into expression through the revelation of the Kav . The reason that He is “not of any of these attributes whatsoever” is because of His absolute unity and singularity, that He is absolutely unlimited. It is therefore clear that it is He who defines and limits, thus bringing forth and defining and limiti ng the different sefirot . However, for this same reason, He is certainly capable of unifying the “opposites” which He Himself brought forth, (since in essence , in Him they do not c onflict, and are not opposites)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" This , then , is the meaning of , “You are He who unifies them etc”. It specifically states, “You [are He] ” , referring to “He” who “is One, but not in [a way of] an enumeration” 34 of ten sefirot . 35 Similarly, the powe r of the Reshimu and the Kav to limit and measure, (which is why it is called “T he Measuring Line ” ( Kav HaMidah )), comes specifically from the Essence of the Infinite Light 36 . M ore over , [these two powers] are interdependent . 37 (This is in accordance with w hat is stated elsewhere 38 regarding the general matter of Chessed (Kindness) and Gevurah (Might) within Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof (T he Essence of the Infinite Light ). [It explains there] t hat [the Gevurah of the Essence] is the power of limitation, to limit and conceal , [thus withdrawing into] Himself [in a way of] ele vation after elevation, end lessly and without measurement. This is the meaning of the statement 39 , “The Infinite Light is above with out end” . [ In contrast, Chessed of the Essence] is t he aspect of the spreading down of the light , “down below with out conclusion”, by means of the Kav which extends from the Reshimu . These are two equally balanced lines , and [are both] unlimited . Therefore, even in the lowering of the Infinite Light within this Kav , t hese two powers, i.e. the power to restrain and limit, and the power to bind and unify, are equal. Likewise, regarding the matter of changes in the light and its expression, whether [it will be] with additional or diminished [revelation], such as [the dif ference] between the weekday s and Sh abbat or Holidays, or the [difference between the] time of the Holy Temple and the time of exile, it all comes from one power. [This one power] divides into the two lines of Chessed and Gevurah , which are equally balanc ed. This c omes from the power of the original light, i.e. [the Light] of Atzmoot Ein Sof (The Essence of the Unlimited One ), from the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah , as He is, in and of Himself. This will suffice for those of understanding.) This is in accordance with what was explained above (in chapter fourteen), that a line is a Heyulie relative to a plane. [This is to say,] it includes the essential power and light of the essence of the influencer , 40 except that in the E ssence it is [revea led] with a great expanse, whereas in this line , the very same power comes [revealed] in an aspect of restricted influence and expression [according to the capacities] of the recipients . 41 This being the case,   34 See introduction to Tikkunei Zohar , 17a. 35 This is as explained in chapter 7 - footnote 29. That is, His absolute singularity is beyond the enumeration of the ten sefirot . He creates them, but is beyond them, and cannot be counted by them or amongst the m. It is specifically from His Essential Singularity that all unity comes afterwards, in the revelation of the Kav . 36 This is as explained in footnote 33 of this chapter. 37 For, in essence , they are really one power, which is the Infinite power of the Essence of G -d. 38 See Shaarei Teshuva 87a. 39 See Zohar Chadash , Yitro 34, 3. See also Tikkunei Zohar, 40b. See also Torat Chayim , Noach 69b, and footnote 11 there. The entire statement is, “The Infinite Light is above without end, and below without conclusion”. 40 This is to say that the Kav – Line has the ability to expand back into the plane, the “length and breadth” of the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum . This is like the limited teaching of the teacher which can again become expanded in the mind of the student, so much so that through his to il, t he student is capable of reconstituting the same depth of understanding of the teacher. This is only because the essential light of the teacher is invested within his short teachings. 41 This means that although it contains the light of the Essence wi thin it, it contains it in the “short” form of the line ( Kav ), which has not yet been expanded into a “pla ne”. This lessening takes place so that the influence may come within the grasp of the recipients , as in the analogy of the teacher/student relations hip ."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"even the aspect of the restrain t and expression of [the Kav ], comes specifically from [ Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof (The Essence of the Infinite Light) .

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Sixteen We must now understand the specifics of the matter of this Line and Thread ( Kav V’Chut ), [and] how it has [both] the aspects of encompassing [lights] and pervading [lights] . 1 This is as stated in Etz Chaim 2 , “It circles, and returns, and re- encircles” , (as explained elsewhere at length) . 3 [It is] this aspect of the f irst encompassin g circle which is called “the Lower Purity” . 4 This is the aspect of the general encompassing [light], which encompasses the four worlds of ABY”A 5 equally, as stated in [the beginning of ] Etz Chaim . However, let us first precede with [the explanation] of the general matter of the Line ( Kav ), [to understand] how it is the aspect of a general Heyulie for all the many particular influence s which “branch out” from it, until the end of the [world of] Asiyah , as mentioned previously. This may be understood by w ay of the well known analogy regarding the matter of a general thought. With this general thought, “He gazes and sees to the end of all generations...with one glance” . 6 (As Maimonides 7 expresses it , this is the [meaning of the his] statement , “With the kn owledge of Himself, He knows all creatures ”, as explained elsewhere at length.) As is known, the explanation of these things is that there are two types of desire . The first is the simple [essential ] desire of the Essence, which is literally included in His Essence. This cannot yet be termed a “general thought or desire”, for it still is totally one with His Essence, literally . 8   1 Encompassing lights are called Makifim , and Pervading lights are called Pnimim . 2 See Etz Chaim , Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1 , Anaf 2. 3 There are two ways that the aforement ioned Kav – Line manifests. The first is called Igullim – Circles, while the second is called Yosher – Upright. In this chapter and the next, the Rebbe will explain both, and the differences between them. In general, Igullim – Circles, refers to the de scent of the all of the particular desires in all of Creation. In contrast, Yosher – Upright, refers to the manifestation and actualization of the desire. This will now be explained in greater detail. 4 Tihiroo Tata’a – The Lower Purity 5 This is an acro nym for the worlds, Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 6 See Tractate Rosh HaShana 18a. 7 See Hilchot Yesodot HaTorah , Chapter 8:9, 10. Also see Tanya , Chapter 42 and 48. 8 This is as explained in chapters 10 and 11. The analogy was given there of the power of movement as it is in the essence. It cannot be called movement at all, for it is not at all separate from the Essence. Moreover, it was explained that in the Essence it is impossible to say that one quality becomes “unified” with another essent ial quality, since they are both literally one with the essence, and therefore inseparable and distinguishable from it. This then also explains the statement of the Zohar , “He who separates one [quality] from the other, it is as if he has separated You”. Likewise here, the simple essential desire of the Essence cannot be termed a “general thought or desire” which encompasses particulars. This is because, as"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" For example, even if this desire has already been determined within Himself, [that is,] how to do a particular act of kindness , or how to speak or think it, or how to conceptualize a particular concept, or how to have desire or pleasure in a particular thing , nonetheless , even though this [essential] determined desire is connected to the extension of the desire to a particular ma tter, ho wever, it [itself] remains included in His hidden e ssence . 9 It, Therefore, does not yet have aspects of “general” and “particular”. It is only afterwards, when the desire which He determined [in Himself] arises to come [out] into act uality 10 tha t it becomes revealed out of its hidden ness . [Only] then does this desire come to an aspect of “general” and “particular ”. In other words, [now it may be defined as a] general thought which includes the entire [concept of ] the act, from beginning to end, in on e glance. Afterwards, it divides into particular desires, each of which possess intellect and emotions etc . 11 [Each of these desires] come in succession to one a nother in a chaining down, in which the upper [desire] encompasses the lower 12 [desire] , “like a circle within a circle” . 13 This [type of desire] is called a “com posite” desire, for it [is made up of] a general [desire] and particular [desires] . 14 This may be understood through the well known analogy of a person who desires to build a large bu ilding, according to his predetermined desire that it should specifically be [built] in a special manner . 15 Now, even though t his predetermined desire come s in a way of a       explained, it is absolutely one with the Essence, which cannot be described as desire, but only th e source of desire. 9 This is like a human being’s essential taste for something. That is, it is determined in the very essence of his soul that he will like some things and despise others, in a particular way. However, this is before he has any revealed desire for it altogether. This called “ Ratzon HaMoochlat – the Determined Desire”, and it corresponds to the aforementioned aspect of the “engraving” which “was engraved” in the Upper Purity. Because it precedes the first Tzimtzum it is still totally on e with the essence, and indistinguishable from it. For this reason it cannot be called a “general” to a “particular”, since all that exists is the quintessential Singularity of G -d. (The difference between the analogy and the analogue is that a human bei ng is born with his tastes and essential desires. In contrast, in G -d, the essential desire is completely according to His absolute free will.) 10 This is to say, only beginning with the limited revelation of the Kav, after the first Tzimtzum , is it possib le for there to be “general” and “particular”. This is because the quintessential Singularity has already been concealed, and there is now an “above” and “below” due to the issuance of the Kav HaMidah – Line of Measurement. 11 For example, the intellect of the desire is “why he desires this”, and the emotions of the desire is similar to the love which propels one to fulfill the desire or the “hate” which inspires him to stand against anything that opposes it. 12 In other words, there is the most primal desire for the whole of Creation. This desire is called the “ Machshava HaK’dooma – the Primal Thought”, which views Creation, from beginning to end, as a whole with a single glance.” However, each particular of this general desire is subdivided into smaller pa rticulars, and each of those contains its particulars etc. Each desire is only a particular relative to the general desire which encompasses it, but is a general desire relative to the particulars included within it. In this sense, the desires are like c oncentric circles. The most general desire is the most all encompassing, for it encompasses all of the particular desires within it. Each of the subsequent desires is encompassed by the desires above it, but encompasses the desires below it. This is com pared to the layers of an onion. 13 Ezekiel 1:16, 10:10 14 This is to say, it is “composed” of parts: general parts and particular parts. 15 That is, according to his essential taste, or “ Ratzon HaMoochlat – Determined Desire” (which as mentioned previously, refers to the “letters” which were “engraved” in the Upper Purity)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"meas ured, specific pleasure, that it should [specifically] be thus, and it obviously [follows that ] the intellect and emotions [of this desire] come with [certain define d] proportions and measurements, nevertheless , all of this is the estimati on and predetermination as it still [exists] with in his essence. [As of yet] i t is [totally] incl uded in his essence, and it is as if it is nonexistent . 16 O nly with the passage of time , when this thought comes to be acted upon, is it that the actual divisions of all the se predetermined particulars and various specifications become recognized. However , at first , this desi re comes in a general manner , i.e. that he should have a build ing with a particular form . Afterwards, it divides into particular de sires for each particular detail . It [thus] descends with order and levels, [beginning with the first general [desire] which in cludes everything in one glance, to a particular of this desire. [Now, the par ticular desire] is [also] considered to be a general [desire] relative to the [part icular] desires which branch from it. [This process continues] until t he very final desire and concept which is the final action, at the conclusion of everything 17 . This will suffice for those of understanding. The analogue of all of this may be understood [in regard to how it is] above, as far as the difference between the aspect s of the Upper Purity an d the Lower Purity which follows the Tzimtzum . That which He estim ated within Himself in potential within the Upper Purity, is similar to the aforementioned determination as it is with in the simple de sire of the essence. As of yet it has not come to an aspect of sprea ding forth from the Essence altogether . More over, even though this essential determined desir e connects to the extended desire that follows after , nonetheless, it remains in cluded in the hidden e ssence of the Inf inite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) 18 . It is therefore above [and beyond ] the aspect of a general [desire ], to be considered as “[a general desire] which for esees and gazes [at everything ] in a single glance”.   16 It is as if it does not exist, for all that exists at this point is the very essence itself, and this desire is in no way separate from the essence. Therefore, it is as if it does not e xist at all, except in Heyulie potential, as described in chapters 10 & 11. 17 For example, in the above analogy, his original primal desire is for a particular dwelling place. This is the most general desire. However, the desire for the dwelling place is comprised of particular desires for its various rooms, such as a living room, bath room, kitchen etc. Here, the desire for the dwelling place is the general desire, whereas the desire for a kitchen is only a particular of the general desire for the house . Likewise, the desire for a kitchen is general relative to its particulars, such as the desire for a refrigerator, an oven, a toaster and a sink etc. The desire for an oven, likewise, is general, relative to its particulars. In the same way, the genera l desire for all of Creation includes within itself all the particular desires for all the levels of existence which result from it. Each of these levels is a general desire relative to the levels that follow it, but a particular desire relative to the le vels that precede it. This primal desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), is the all encompassing “circle”, which contains all subsequent desires. Each subsequent desire encompasses all the particular desires that follow it, and is contained by the desires that preced e it. 18 This is to say that the revealed desire is “bound” with the essential “taste” or “predetermined desire” of the Essence. It is like a carbon copy of the “engraved letters” of the essential desire, and is exactly according to the estimation which to ok place in the Essence. Nonetheless, the simple essential desire itself, does not spread forth into revelation, but rather, it remains concealed within the essence. This is because it is totally and absolutely one with the Essence and, therefore, on thi s level, all that exists is the Essence. It is totally concealed in this absolute unity. Therefore, this essential desire cannot be called a “general” desire to “particular” desires etc. This is as previously explained (in chapter 13) that the light of the Essence cannot be considered like an encompassing light which encompasses and surrounds something internal to it ( Makif L’Pnimi ). It is only after Tzimtzum , when the quintessential singularity of the Essence of the Infinite Light is concealed, that th ere is now a revelation of a defined general desire for Creation, and all its particulars."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" However, the second desire, which follows the a forementioned Tzimtzum , is when the simple determined desire of the essence comes to the aspect of spreading forth. This is the aspect of the Heyulie Line and Thread ( Kav V’Chut ), which includes every particular issuance from the beginning [of the chainin g down] to its end, as previously mentioned . The first encompassing [light of this Kav ] is called “the Lower Purity”. This is analogous to the general desire for a large building 19 . [This gen eral desire] includes all its particulars from beginning to end, at once. Afterwards it divides with order and levels [descending] from the general to the particular , as in the aforementioned analogy. In other words, as it arose in His simple Heyulie desire, to specifically come out into revelation, it incl uded all the particular desires. This is the desire which incl udes [and encompasses] them all, and is called, “T he Primal Desire” ( Ratzon HaKadoom ) relative to everything that follows it. A fterwards, this desire comes by way of particular s, such as the desire to emana te ( Atzilut ), within which is included [the desire for the] ten sefirot [of the world of Atzilut ] in all of their particulars. However, all of this is still concealed, until it comes into an aspect of revelation, when the light is emanated in an aspect of [actual] emanation ( Atzilut ) 20 . Foll owing this is the desire to create ( Briyah ) something from nothing etc. This [desire] includes [the ten sefirot of] intellect and emotions etc. [This descent of desires continues] until the final d esire, which is, “Eve rything that G -d desired , He did” [and brought out into actuality]. [This is] the final conclusion of everything 21 . Now, all these particulars were included in the Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), which comes in an aspect of influence after the [original] Tzimtzum . This , then , is the aspect of the beginning of the Line ( Kav ). This is to say, it is the first “circle” which follows the drawing down of the beginning of the aforementioned Heyulie Line ( The Kav HaMidah ). [This first “circle”] is considered to be the general encompassin g [light] of the four worlds of ABY”A , 22 and encompasses them [all] equally. It is [also] ca lled the “general thought” that foresees and “gazes” upon [all of Creation] , from beginning to end, in a single glance . This , then , is th e explanation of th e general matter of the whole of this Line – Kav . All the particular ways that it , “circles and returns and re- encircles...” may be understood according to the aforementioned analogy, as will be explained in the following chapter , G -d wil ling . This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Cha pter Sixteen   19 See footnote 17 of this chapter. 20 One explanation of this is as follows: The particular desire for the world of Atzilut has not yet been revealed as a particula r desire, out of this general desire for the Creation as a whole. It is included there as part of the “whole”. Another explanation of this is that this is only the desire for the world of Atzilut , which encompasses it. However, we have not yet discussed the actual emanation of the sefirot of the world of Atzilut etc, which is the actualization of the desire. The actualization of desires will be explained later, in regard to the sefirot of “Yosher – Upright”. 21 This is to say that this scheme of “ Igullim – Circles” represents the desires for everything in all of Creation, from the uppermost realm, until the most particular subatomic particle of this physical world. All of these desires are included in the general desire, the Ratzon HaKadoom – the Primal Desire, which is the most encompassing circle, and is the first issuance of the Kav - Line. 22 This is an acronym for the worlds, Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah ."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Seventeen We must now understand the particulars of the matter of the Kav - Line, as it is in an aspect of “ Igullim - Circles” [and “ Yosher - Upright”] etc. 1 However, we must preface with [an explanation] of the aspect of the beginning of this Kav - Line, which comes in an aspect of a pervading , inner light ( Ohr Pnimi ), and then encircles and [once again] is drawn down as a pervading , inner light. T hen it once again encircles etc. It is explained in Etz Chaim 2 that in the aspect of the ten sefirot of Igullim – The c ircles of desire , the uppermost is the most superior, while the innermost is the [mos t] inferior, whereas in the aspect of the ten sefirot of Yosher - The u pright sefirot , the opposite is true. [This is to say that ] the uppermost is the [most ] inferior, while the innermost is the [most ] superior. Now, the explanation of these matters is as follows: It is known, that although in relation to the aspect of the simple determined desire of the Essence 3 ( Atzmoot ), the aspect of this Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ) is called a spreading forth of the desire. However, it too is still concealed, and not at all revealed . This is because [the Ratzon HaKadoom - the Primal Desire] is only the influence and expression of the Simple Desire for kindness, which has already been determined in the Essence ( Atzmoot ) that it should come into actuality in a partic ular way. Immediately, when it arises in though how everything should be , it is called the “Primal Thought and Desire” ( Machshava V’Ratzon Kadoom ). [This thought] includes within it self every particular desire [of the entire chaining down of the worlds ], as explained prev iously in the analogy of a building. 4 If this is the case, this   1 As explained in the previous chapter, the scheme of Igullim - Ci rcles, refers to the “circles” of desire, in which the most general desire encompasses all the particular desires within it. In contrast, the scheme of Yosher - Upright, refers to the actualization of the desire for Creation. The difference will soon be explained. 2 See Etz Chaim ( Drush Igullim V’Yosher ), Shaar 1, Anaf 2, 3 . 3 Ratzon HaPashoot HaMoochlat Ba’Atzmoot. This refers to the simple Essential desire which was explained in chapters ten and eleven. 4 As explained in the previous chapter, the first g eneral “Primal Desire” for the building includes within it all the particular desires for all of the specific details of the building. However, in truth, the first primal desire for the building is not actually for the building altogether. In truth, the first primal thought and desire for the building is that of his own pleasure residing in it. This is to say that, at this point, the desire is not yet for anything external to himself, but is rather actually for the self. It is for this reason that the R ebbe continues His next sentence and states, “If this is the case, this entire primal desire is still within himself, without being revealed outside.” In other words, the desire is the thought of the pleasure he will derive through its actualization. The refore, although it is an expression of the self, it is still entirely focused on the self, and, therefore, cannot be considered to be outside of it. This is in contrast to the desire for the building itself. For example, in the desire for a chair there are really two desires, one more essential"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"entire Primal Desire is s till within Himself, without being reve aled outside [of Himself] . Nonetheless , afterwards, everything is actualized from [this Primal Desire]. 5 Th is, then , is the meaning of [the verse ] 6 , “ For He spoke”, with in the Primal Thought, “and it was”. 7 This [Primal Thought] is called “ T he life of all the worlds”, from the “head” of Adam Kadmon to the “ heel ” of Adam Kadmon [which is] at the end of the worl d of Asiyah (Actualization). 8 This is the meaning of [the statement], “All of creation is not concealed from You”. [This means that ] there is [not a single particular detail ], even the most final of details , which did not originally exist with in this [Pr imal] Desire and Thought. On the contrary, [ as it states 9 , “T he end action ar ose first in thought”]. [Thi s is to say that ] “The end action”, such as the end of the seventh millennium 10 , “arose” with in the Primal Thought “first”, as explained elsewhere at length. 11       than the other. The first and most primal desire is the desire to sit, and the pleasure which will be derived from that. The second, more external desire is the desire for the chair itself. The desire for the c hair only follows from the desire and pleasure derived from sitting. Likewise, in Creation, this first Primal Desire is not yet the desire for Creation itself, but for the pleasure which will ultimately be derived from it. All subsequent desires follow f rom this Primal Desire. (In other words, in the above example of the desire for a building or a house, the desire is not really for a house, but rather, it is for a home etc.) 5 In other words, it is from this Primal Desire and pleasure of Self, from whi ch all the specific desires are drawn out of afterwards, such as the desire for the building itself, and all its details. 6 Psalms 33:9 7 In Hebrew the verse reads, “ Ki Hoo Amar VaYehee – For He spoke, and it was”. The word used for “Spoke” is “ Amar ”. A s will be explained later in the book, generally, when the word “Amar ” is used, it refers to thought. When the word “ Daber ” (which also means “to speak”) is used, it refers to actual speech, which is the actualization. All of this will be explained later at great length. 8 The reason it is called “the life of all the worlds” is because it is this thought of pleasure of the self, which is the essential motivation of all the subsequent desires for all the particulars in Creation, from the “head” of Adam Ka dmon , until the “heel” of Adam Kadmon , which is at the end of the world of Actualization - Asiyah . 9 See Lecha Dodee prayer of Friday night. 10 It is explained that corresponding to the days of the week and the days of creation, there are six millenniums in C reation in which the world has not yet reached its absolute perfection. These are the six “work days”, so to speak. Then, the seventh day, or millennium, is when the world reaches its perfection, and is called Shabbat -the day of rest. It is at the end o f the seventh millennium when Creation reaches its ultimate fulfillment and purpose, and becomes a dwelling place for the Holy One Blessed Be He. This corresponds to the holiest time of the day of Shabbat, which is at the end of Shabbat. This time period of the Shabbat is called “a foretaste of the world to come” ( M’Ein Olam HaBa ). It is for this reason that in some Chassidic groups it is customary not to eat during this period, but, instead, to learn the teachings of Chassidut, which is the “Knowledge o f G - d”. This is because at that time, when the world becomes a perfect receptacle for G - dliness, “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of G -d, like the waters cover the ocean floor etc.” This is the pleasure that G - d derives from, “dwelling below” which is what originally arose in His Primal Thought. 11 This means that the final action, which is the realization of G - d’s pleasure in dwelling in the world , arose first in thought. This is the Primal Thought ( Ratzon Kadoom ), which is the first all e ncompassing “circle” for all of Creation. It is this Primal Thought which is the inner motivation for all the particular desires which follow. In the analogy of the house or building, the first things that arise in one’s mind are actually the most final details, such as the wallpaper, the color of the paint, the furniture etc. Moreover, what one is thinking of when the desire for a house first arises, is the thought of himself in the house, and the pleasure he will derive from it. He is not thinking of the building of the house, and the plywood or cement and insulation or wires in the walls, but is really thinking about the most external and final details, like the chandeliers or the color of the paint etc. Most essentially though, he is thinking of hi s own pleasure. This is the meaning of “the end action arose first in thought”. At this stage the particular desires for the materials and tools to build the house are totally concealed within this thought and primal desire for his own pleasure, which, r eally, is the main consideration."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" (In 12 the terminology of the Zohar this [Primal Thought] is called “ Ateeka D’Ateekin -The Ancient of the Ancients” 13 or 14 “ Ateeka Stima’ah -The Concealed Ancient One ” . 15 This is the aspect of, “The Supernal Desire of all Desires , which is revealed in the forehead of the Holy Ancient One ( Atika Kadisha ) ” . 16 This is because pleasure is invested within desire, so that they are literally as one. 17 Likewise, the simple [essential] heyulie desire of the heyulie desire for kindness (which was mentioned previo usly in chapters 10 and 11) , included the simple pleasure of the Essence ( Atzmoot ). This is called, “ the delight of the King in Hims elf ( Sha’ashoo’aiy HaMelech B’Atzmooto ) ”. This is also [the case] in regard to the three levels of [ Yachid, Echad and Kadm on 18 ], until [the Essential de sire] came to the particular matter of “ Ana Emloch - I shall rule ”. This is the aspect of Malchut (Kingdom) of The Infinite ( Ayn Sof ), which preceded the Tzimtzum , as explained there. 19 All [these levels] are the aspect of “ The delight of the King in Hims elf, with in the Upper Purity. 20 However, “ Ateeka D’Ateekin – The Ancient of the Ancients”, which is the source of all pleasures, and [is also known as] “The Supernal Desire of all Desires ”, refers to the aspect of the Line - Kav whi ch follows Tzimtzum . It includes [all] the variou s desires and pleasures that are destined to be reve aled . “ Atika Stima’ah -The Concealed Ancient One ” is the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon [and] is the concealed desire and pleasure, a s it still relates to Himself, except that [now, after the   12 This parenthesis may be difficult for a beginner who is going over the material for the first time. It may be skipped for the time being, until one has studied the book thoroughly. 13 This is the terminology of the Zohar in various places. See Troomah 165b, Naso ( Idra Rabba ) 128a -b, and other places. 14 See Zohar , Naso ( Idra Rabba ) 129a, 132a, and other places. 15 As will be explained in chapter 23, Atik refers to pleasure, while Arich refers to desire. It is explained the re that these two facets of the sefirah of Keter are truly inseparable. It is impossible to have a desire without a pleasure, or a pleasure without a desire. (This will be explained later on at great length.) Here though, the aspect of Atika D’Atikin – The Ancient of the Ancient, refers to the Primal Thought, which is the thought of the pleasure of G -d Himself, which will be derived from all of Creation, as this arises in thought as a whole. It is this “Supernal Desire of all Desires ( Ra’ava D’Kol Ra’av in Ila’in )” which is the source of any particular pleasure and desire in the rest of the chaining down of the worlds. (It is also worthy to note that the word Atik - Ancient, may also be translated as “Copy”. This Primal Desire for all of Creation is like a carbon copy of the “letters” which were “engraved” in the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), and is essentially the same desire, except that now, it comes out as a desire, while in the Essential Light of the Self of G - d there was no “de sire”, but only G -d Himself, as previously explained.) 16 See Zohar, Naso ( Idra Rabba ) 129a, 136b. “ Rayva D’Kol Rayvin Ila’een, D’Itgalyn B’Metzcha D’Atika Kadisha. ” The Metzcha – Forehead, refers to Da’at . As mentioned previously (chapter 1), the facult y of Da’at is focus and concentration. Therefore, the explanation of the above statement can be understood as follows: Even when the actual particular desire for the external “object” becomes revealed, his focus the entire time is on the “Supernal Desire of all Desires”, which is the desire for the pleasure of the Self. 17 This will be explained later, in chapter 23. 18 These three levels were explained in chapters 10 and 11. 19 That is, as explained in chapters 10 and 11. 20 This is to say that all these le vels are still within the Upper Purity, within the Light of the Essential Self of G -d. They are therefore indistinguishable from His Essential Singularity, for only He exists. Therefore, they cannot actually be defined as being “general” or “particulars”. Only after Tzimtzum, when the Kav is revealed can this general desire and pleasure for the all of Creation become apparent and revealed. However, even in this revelation, it is still considered to be completely within Himself, as the entire thought is t otally focused towards the Self of G -d. This is to say that this desire or thought is not yet a thought or desire for the particular creatures themselves, but is only the thought of the pleasure that G -d will derive from all of Creation. It is only after wards that the particular pleasures and desires for each and ever y specific in Creation become revealed from this general desire."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Tzimtzum , ] He thinks [and considers ] to bring this [desire] into actual revelation. [For example,] this is like [the desire] that there should be a revelation of the desire and pleasure to emanate the ten sefirot [of t he world of Atzilut - Emanation ], 21 or that there should be the desire and pleasure to create [the world of Briyah ] etc. 22 [The aspect of] “ Atika Kadisha - The Holy Ancient One” is the pleasure which [ becomes invested ] within Chochmah (Insight ). This is the as pect of Atik Yomin ( “ The Ancient of Days ” ) and Arich Anpin ( “ The Long Face ” ) [which are the Keter (pleasure and desire )] of [the world of] Atzilut (Emanation). 23 [This is when] the pleasure and desire become reve aled, all of which will be e xplained in a specific manner .) Now, the [explanation of the ] aspect of the ten sefirot of Igullim -Circles of desire , one within the other, is, as known, that every cause encompasses its effect , “like a circle within a circle” 24 , and that the effect can never grasp its ca use, except in a way of distance from it . This may be understood from a desire which becomes complete ly revealed . 25 Although this [revealed desire] includes ten [ sefirot within it , such as] intellect and emotions etc, nonetheless, it initially comes about as a single decision , with out any apparent divisions [into ten sefirot ]. 26 This is called, “T he G eneral Circle of D esire ” which encompasses [and] contains all [the particulars which will become revealed ], within it. [Every subsequent “circle of desire ” ] comes about specifically from its power. However, [it encompasses the se subsequent “circles of desire ”] from a distance. An example is the reasoning and intellect for this desir e, which is called its effect. It is impossible for it to be close [in a way o f] comparison, to its cause , which is the desire,   21 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (It is for this reason that “ Atika Stima’ah – The Concealed Ancient One” is considered to be an a spect of “concealment which is at least subject to revelation”. This is not the case with the beginning of the Kav, which is called “The Concealment of all Concealments – Steema D’Kol Steemeen ”, for even the thought of Adam Kadmon cannot grasp Him.) 22 The desire for the worlds of Atzilut or Briyah etc, are not yet revealed out of this general desire. This is similar to the aforementioned analogy of one who has a pleasure and desire to sit, before the desire for the chair arises in his thoughts. The diffe rence between these two desires is profound. The first most primal desire is for his pleasure, while the second more external desire that follows it is for the external object, the chair. Likewise above, the Primal Desire is for the pleasure of G -d Himse lf, and not yet for the worlds of ABY”A . It is only afterwards (with the revelation of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin ) that the desire for the worlds themselves comes forth into revelation from this Primal Desire. 23 This will soon be explained, in chapters 23 and 24. 24 Ezekiel 1:16, 10:10 25 That is to say, by understanding how it is in the revealed desire, such as the desire for the world of Atzilut or any other revealed desire, we will be able to understand how these “circles of desire” exist in the conceal ed desire, the Primal Desire. This is because all desires are included in the aspect of Igullim – Circles. 26 At first all that is revealed is the desire, such as, “I want a house” etc. Only afterwards, does the wisdom or conceptualization of how to build the house become revealed from this desire for the house. In other words, the “circle of the desire” encompasses the circle of wisdom or insight etc. The desire to conceptualize how to build the house only follows the desire for the house etc. Furtherm ore, “circle” of desire only empowers the “circle” of wisdom or insight from afar. This means that the “reasoning of the intellect” can never fully capture the desire or the essential truth of it, for “desire is altogether beyond reason”."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"because, as is known , “desire is altogether beyond reason ” , 27 [and , therefore ] it can never be comprehended [through reasoning] . Never theless, it is from the power of desire that the “circle” of Chochmah - Insight comes about, though, i t too has no recognizable divisions into ten [ sefirot ]. 28 This is similar to the analogy of [a ju dge] who, [because he] has been bribed, will find a rationalization for the desire. 29 Although this [desire for] reasoning also inc ludes ten [ sefirot ], i.e. desire, intellect, and e motions, nonetheless, it is comes about in a general fashion etc. 30 Likewise, the “circle” of Binah -Comprehension , which comes about from the power [of the “circle” of Chochmah ], can never grasp [ its cause] . In this manner, t he [“circles of the desire” for the ] emotions [ are also drawn forth ,] one within the other. [This continues] until the [“circle of the desire” for the ] end action , which is the final circle [of desire] . All of this is included in the de sire for Himself, until the end action which is the in nermost [circle of desire] etc. Likewise this is how it is in the aforementioned concealed desire, which is called the Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), the source of all the desires [for the entire cha ining down of the worlds ]. 31 It includes ten sefirot , one circle [of desire] within the other circle [of desire] , until the circle [of the desire] for the end action. This is the desire for the end action, since “everything that He desires, He does” in act uality. The aforementioned Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ) is the uppermost circle [of desire], which includes [and encompasses] everything [that is desired in the entire chaining down of the worlds. ] 32 [Now, all this is in the aspect of desire], however, when this desire for Himself comes to be actualize d , it is the other way around. [This is to say that ] the desire becomes concealed and   27 See Shney Luch ot HaBrit , Beit HaShem 4b. See footnote in the name of Rabbi Yosef Al Kastilia. See also Yonat Elem (of Rabbi Menachem Azaria from Pano ) Chapter 2. See also Torat Chayim 63a, footnote 7. 28 This is to say that it is the desire to conceptualize a reasonin g etc. However, it too, is just a simple desire for reasoning, which has not yet divided into ten sefirot of actual reasoning. 29 Because he has received a bribe he has a desire to exonerate the defendant. Now, because of his desire to exonerate the defen dant, this brings up a secondary desire to come up with an intellectual line of reasoning through which to exonerate him. Nonetheless, this secondary desire is not the totality of his desire, but is only a secondary, subsequent circle of desire, the sole purpose of which is to bring about his true desire. However, his true desire is not even to exonerate the defendant. Rather, it is the desire for the pleasure which he derives from the bribe money. 30 That is to say, its particulars have not yet been revea led from the desire. As of yet, it is not an actual intellectual line of reasoning altogether, but only the simple and general desire for reason. 31 In contrast to the revealed desire for something, the Primal Desire is the most essential and all encompass ing of all desires. As explained previously, the Primal Desire is not yet the desire for Creation itself, but is rather the desire and thought of the pleasure which will be derived at the end action. Likewise, the subsequent circles of the Primal Desire, i.e. its ten sefirot , are also Primal Desires still completely focused towards Himself. So, in contrast to the revealed desire for wisdom, for a particular reasoning, the Primal Desire of Wisdom, the circle of Chochmah , is the Primal Desire and Pleasure in being wise etc. This is likewise the case with the other ten sefirot of the Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ). (Nevertheless, all desires, both concealed and revealed, are from the aspect of Igullim – Circles, and all desires function in such a manner. I n contrast, the actualization of the desire functions in an entirely different manner, which is called Yosher – Upright. This is the system of investments, in which the upper sefirah or realm becomes invested within the lower one, as will be explained.) 32 That is, the uppermost circle is the most all encompassing desire for His own pleasure, while the innermost desire which f ollows is the desire for the external action itself, which brings His pleasure to fruition . Therefore, the statement of the Etz Cha im that , “ in the aspect of the ten sefirot of Igullim – Circles, the uppermost is the most superior, while the innermost is the [most] inferior ” , is now understood."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"invested in the intellect, and the intellect encompasses it. Then the intellect becomes concealed and invested in the em otions, one within the other, until the end action , which is the uppermost . 33 In other words, invested within the actual power of the action ar e the thoughts. Invested within the thoug hts are the emotions. I nvested within the emotions are Chochmah -Insight and Binah - Comprehension, and invested within Chochma h is the desire ( Arich ) and pleasure ( Atik ). [Here] we find that the innermost of them all is the desire and pleasure, while the most exte rnal of them all is the action [which is the most] inferior one . This is the aspect of Yosher - Upright, which comes in an aspect of the upper being invested in the lower. However, in the aspect of the aforementioned Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ), because it is still within Himself, it is therefore drawn forth in an aspe ct of Igullim - Circles, in which the uppermost is this concealed all encompassing desire. 34 The first circle [in the scheme of Igullim – Circles] is the desire and pleasure for the whole chaining down [of the worlds] which is within it. This circle is the general encompassing [light] of the [four worlds of] ABY”A , as mentioned previously. The beginning of the Kav - Line is the aspect of a Heyulie drawing down [of influence] , like a short line which diminishes (by way of Tzimtzum ) from cause to affect, such a s from Ratzon - Desire to Chochmah -Insight, and the like. 35 Likewise, from the aspect of the aforementioned Reshimu - Impression, a Kav – Line is drawn with very great diminishment. 36 For, although the Reshimu - Impression comes about in [a way of] limitation [of the Infinite Light], as explained previously, nonetheless, it is still from the aspect of the Infinite World , 37 except that it is the   33 In other words, in the actualization of the desire the most external and revealed of all them all is the action itself. Contained within the action is the thought, which contains the emotions. The emotions contain the intellect, and the intellect contains the desire. We find that in the case of the actualization of the desire, the final act ion contains everything within it and is “uppermost”, while the desire does not contain the action, but is most internal to it. This is the explanation for the statement in the beginning of the chapter that, “I n the aspect of the ten sefirot of Yosher – U pright, it is the opposite , the uppermost is the [most] inferior, while the innermost is the [most] superior ”. 34 In other words, the aspect of the Primal Desire is still within the realm of desire, and has not yet come into the realm of actualization. T herefore, because it is still within the realm of desire it functions according to the scheme of Igullim – Circles, in which the uppermost is the most all encompassing, general desire and the innermost is the most specific. 35 We previously explained that t he issuance of the short Kav - Line creates the “dimensions” of “above” and “below”. This creates the possibility of cause and effect. That is to say, the line of measurement ( Kav HaMidah ) creates a diminishment between one attribute and the next, so that one is “above” and one is “below”. (As will later be explained, the lower level receives only from the external letters ( Malchut ) of the higher level. This is analogous to the speech of a King, in which the servants receive only the speech of the command , but not the reasoning or emotions or any of the inner light etc.) For example, if there was no diminishment between Keter - the Desire and Chochmah -Insight, there would be no such thing as insight, but only desire. It is this limitation of the line which creates the dimension of above and below, thereby creating the possibility for “general” and “particular”. 36 This is to say that while the Reshimu - Impression is still totally infinite, the Kav - Line is already a limited line of revelation, outside of the Es sential Self. Therefore, the issuance of the Kav - Line is incomparably diminished relative even to the Reshimu - Impression, which is still totally infinite. 37 As explained previously, the Reshimu - Impression is like a point, where there is no “above” or “bel ow”. Furthermore, as explained before, and as the Rebbe states in the next sentence, the Reshimu -Impression contains the whole of the Infinite Light within it. It, therefore, cannot be considered a “general” to a “particular” whatsoever, for it is still an absolute Heyulie , and there is no above or below."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"last aspec t [of the Infinite], which come about with brevity. This is not the case with the Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoo m ) which comes into the category of [expressing ] influence outside of the Infinite World. However, [because] it [still] is an all encompassing Heyulie [for the entire chaining down of the worlds], therefore it is drawn out by way of a short line. 38 This will suffice for those of understanding. 39 (This is [in accordance with] the statement in Etz Chaim ; that the essential purpose of the radiance of the Kav -Line, is solely to bring about the aspects of “above” and “below” such as the ten Igullim - Circles, [w hich follow a progression of higher and lower] until the end action. 40 In contrast, in the Infinite World , even the aspects of “above” or “below” do not exist . Rather, there is only absolute ly simple singularity , as previously explained . Furthermore, even though [in potential] He estimat ed within Himself that which is destine d to be, it all is actually still within Himself and is literally in an aspect of being infinite. Because of this it states in Etz Chaim 41 that it is forbidden to speak even in regard t o the aspect of Malchut of the Infinite ( Malchut D’Ein Sof ). 42 Rather, we are permitted to speak in regard to the aspect of the Kav - Line and the aspect of Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man). [Since] this is the aspect of the first source of the entire chaining down [of the worlds] , it may, therefore, be comprehended in [relation to] the many descents [that take place] until [the comprehension of how] the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut become [invested] within BY”A . 43 This is because they [the kav and part icularly Adam Kadmon ] are called by the name, “the Cause of all Causes” ( Eelot Kol HaEelot ) 44 and 45 “the Primordial of all the Primordials”   38 That is to say, in order for the Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ) to be considered a “general desire” for all the “particular desires” in the chaining down, it is necessary for it to come out of the issua nce of the Kav – Line, in order for there to be the aspects of “above” and “below”. This is not the case with the point of the Reshimu – Impression, where there is no “above” or “below”. 39 In this paragraph the Rebbe brings out the fact that there needs to be additional Tzimtzum lessening, from the Reshimu which is still completely infinite and the Primal Desire. As explained in Shaar HaEmunah (in the explanation of the difference between the word Yachid - Singular and the word Kadmon – Primordial), the wo rd “Primordial - Kadoom ” (or Kadmon ) denotes that it is “primordial” to everything which comes from it. This denotes a “general” and “particulars” which come out of the “general”. This necessitates a second Tzimtzum lessening between the Reshimu and the Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ). This is because, as explained, the Reshimu contains the whole of the Infinite Light within it, and therefore possesses the potential for infinite revelation. Furthermore, it is a point, and as previously explained, a point has no “above” or “below” or “beginning”, “middle” or “end”. Therefore, although the Primal Desire is the same desire as before Tzimtzum , that is, the desire for the pleasure of G -d Himself at the fulfillment of the desire of, “I shall rule”, which was in itially predetermined in the Essence, nonetheless, there is an incomparably qualitative difference between the desire as it exists before Tzimtzum , where it is literally one with the Self of G -d, and as it exists after Tzimtzum , where it is already defined as the general desire which includes the whole of Creation “In one glance”. This will now be further explained in the parenthesis of the Rebbe. 40 In other words, it is the Kav - Line which allows the sefirot to progress from one to the next, where one is “above” and the other is “below”. 41 See Etz Chaim , ( Drush Igullim V’Yosher ) Shaar 1, Anaf 5, and the end of Anaf 2. 42 This is because it is inseparable from the Essential Self of G -d, as stated in the Zohar , “Anyone who separates one [ sefirah ] from another, it is as if he separated You”. Therefore, it is impossible to speak of any of the sefirot of the Essence as anything separate from the Essential Self of G -d, since they are one with Him. This was explained in previous chapters. 43 This is an acronym for the worlds, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 44 See Zohar Bereshit 22b, and Pardes, Shaar 3, Chapter 1. 45 See Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 19 (42a)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"( Kadmon L’Kol HaKedoomin ). 46 However, [ in regard to ] the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) [it stat es, 47 ] “N o thought that can grasp Him”, [which includes] even the aforementioned Primal Thought ( Machshava HaKedooma ). This is because the Infinit e World is qualitatively beyond and is called “Totally Holy” [and transcendant ], as a result of the aforementio ned Tzimtzum . [In contrast ], the aforementioned aspect of the Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ) is called “His Great Name”. “His Name - Shmo ( שמו ) ” i s the s ame numerical value as “Desire - Ratzon ( רצון ) ”. 48 This is the [explanation] of the matter of [the verse in the Kaddish prayer 49 ], “May His Great Name be blessed etc”. 50 ) (Furthermore, as is known, the aspect of Adam Kadmon is called “ Adam D’Bri yah -Man of Creation”, as will be explain ed [in the following chapter].

Therefore, what we are praying for when we say this prayer is that the Primal Desire for the culmination of the entirety of Creation should be drawn down in to actuality and become fully realized. 51 In other words, Adam Kadmon – Primordial Man is called “Man” (or “Man of Creation – Adam D’Briyah ), as will be explained in the following chapter. It therefore possesses some relationship to man below, and may be comprehended. However, regarding the absolutely singular and unlimited Essence of G- d it states, “For He is not a man”, and possesses no relationship whatsoever to limited beings who have form, and therefore, “no thought can grasp Him”. 52 This is to say t hat Adam Kadmon is considered to be the soul of all living beings, because beginning with Adam Kadmon there is a relation to Creation. This is the reason that it is called “Man of Creation – Adam D’Briyah ”, to signify that it is like a completely new crea tion relative to the Ohr Ein Sof , as will be explained in the next chapter. 53 It is understood from this chapter that although the Primal Desire is already an external expression relative to the Self, it is still entirely focused towards the self.

The “end action” which arose in this Primal De sire is the last aspect within it. 2 Now, the Keter of the lower [world] comes about from the a spect of Malchut of the upper [world]. 3 This is the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man ). 4 Moreover, as is known, in [regard to] the general manner 5 [of the chaining down of the worlds ], the aspect of Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man) is called “ Ad am D’Briyah -Man of Creation ” , which is the aspect of Thought ( Machshavah ). Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin of [the world of] Atzilut (Emanation) are called “ Adam D’Yetzirah - Man of Formation ” . Zeir Anpin and Nukvah [of the world of Atzilut ] are called “ Adam D’A siyah -Man of Action ” . Just as the [particular] world of Briyah - Creation is, literally , a creation of “ something from nothing ” , as is known, so too, the aspect of Keter   1 As explained in the previous chapter, this Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ) is the desire and thought of the pleasure of the Self, before any particular desire for anything external to the self becomes revealed at all. It is for t his reason that it is called “the Primal Desire for the Self – Ratzon Kadoom L’Atzmo ”. 2 In other words, the desire to actualize ( Malchut ) the Primal Desire is the most final and innermost circle of desire of the ten sefirot of the Primal Desire. This is the desire to actualize the pleasure of the Self. 3 This was mentioned in previous chapters. The gener al analogy for this is that the speech of the King, which is his most external level, bec omes the inner motivation of his servants. 4 This is to say th at the last level ( Malchut ) of the Ratzon Kadoom - Primal Desire, which is the desire to actualize His pleasure, becomes the first and highest level ( Keter ) of Adam Kadmon - Primordial Man (which will soon be explained). 5 The chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) is a system wh ich repeats itself , both in general and in particular. For example, the ten sefirot of every world also subdivide into ten sefirot, which further subdivide into ten sefirot , ad infinitum. This creates an infinite worlds and realms, e ach different from the other , in that it is either more particular or more general. Likewise, the chaining down of the worlds repeats itself, so that there are general worlds and particular worlds, wh ich although are different, possess similarit ies and likenesses t o the qualities they correspond to. In the “General Worlds - Olamot D’Klalloot ”, there is also a scheme of the four worlds ; Atzilut - Emanation , Briyah - Creation , Yetzirah - Formation and Asiyah -Actualization. The Essence of the Infinite Ligh t which radiates within the Kav - Line and Ratzon HaKadoom - the Primal Desire (which , as explained previously , is a “duplicate ” of the Ratzon HaPashoot HaMoochlat BaAtzmoot - “ The Simple Determined Desire of the Essence”) is compared to the world of Atzilut -Ema nation, which is not yet considered to be a creation of “something from nothing”, but is, rather, an emanation of the Essential Light of G -d. In contrast, Adam Kadmon - Primordial Man is considered to be the general world of Briyah -Creation, and is thus cal led “Man of Creation – Adam D’Briyah ”, and corresponds to the garment of “thought” (as will later be explained ). This is because, as will be explained in this chapter, the existence of Adam Kadmon comes about as a creation of something out of nothing. Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin which are the two aspects of Keter of Atzilut (as will be explained in later chapters) are called “Man of Formation - Adam D’Yetzirah ”, which corresponds to the garment of “speech”. Zeir Anpin and Nukvah of Atzilut (which also will be explained later) are called “Man of Actualization - Adam D’Asiyah ”, and correspond to the garment of “action”."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of Adam Kadmon is considered to be a creation o f something from nothing. [This is to s ay that it is created] from the true “ Ain - N othing” of the Light of the Unlimited One Himself, which is in the aforementioned Kav - Line, which is called the Primal Desire for Himself ( Ratzon Kadoom L’Atzmo ). Now, as is known , the explanation for this is [as follows]: It was explained above that the aforementioned Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ) is called “the source of all desires”. It is the aspect of the Heyulie desire which is the source from which all “desires for desires” 6 find [their existence] . This can be understood by way of analogy from the aspect of the Yechidah of the soul of ma n. The essential Heyulie desire for kindness which is included in it 7 in the aspect of a Heyulie , includes every particular desire for kindness that he is destined to des ire. When [this Heulie desire for kindness] comes to be drawn forth in a particu lar manner for a specific   6 The term “desire for desire – Ratzon L’Ratzon ” must be thoroughly comprehended in order to understand the rest of this chapter. In order to understand the existence of the “desire for the desire”, let us return to the concept of the Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ). It was previously explained that the Primal Desire is like the primordial thought of the pleasure tha t He will derive at the end of C reation. This was compared to one who has a desire for the pleasure in sitting as opposed to the desire for a chair, which is a particular desire which comes out later. Or, another analogy of this is like when one desires to eat a particular food at a particular restaurant. His original , most “primal” thought of this is not of the food itself, nor is he thinking of the getting his keys and wallet and driving to the restaurant. Rather, his first thought is of himself, deriving pleasure from this etc. The last circle of his Ratzon HaKadoom - “Primal desire ” is the desire to actualize ( Malchut ) his pleasure. The ten genera l circles of the Primal Desire can be understood as follows: The first circle is the thought of the pleasure itself, the second circl e is the t hought of the pleasure of “Insight” - Chochmah , the third circle is the primal desir e and thought of the pleasure of “ Understanding ” - Binah etc. Now , what comes ou t of the last “circle” of the “Primal D esire” , which is the thought of the pleasure i n actualization or communication ( Malchut ), is not yet a particular desire for something outside of him self . Rather, once a person’s primal desire comes to the final primal desire to bring his pleasure into actuality , he form ulates a “desire for a desire - Ratzon L’Ratzon ”, which is a new desire based on how the primal desire will relate out, to others. This s econdary desire may be seen as “self - perception”. This is how he perceives himself as being for the entire duration of his life span. For instance, because of his primal desire for honor ( Hod ), he may perceive himself as being a very wise person. This desire is “created”, so to speak, to facilitate the primal desire to be honored. Now, this “self - perception”, likewise, is a general desire which enco mpasses many particular desires. This is to say that because he perceives himself as a wise person, he has particular desires, such as the desire to study profound books on many important subjects. He will want to be well versed in all the arts and scien ces, as well as history, philosophy, law, great literature etc. On the other hand, if he would be offered a pulp romance or a comic book to read, he would reject it with disdain, since it does not fit in with his self -perception. Another example of this is a person who sees himself as a kind person. This self -perception includes every kind act he will ever do. Because he sees himself as kind, he will despise cruelty and callous behavior. This is what is called a “desire for a desire”. That is, it is t he general desire for his entire life span, which includes every particular desire that will ever come out into actual revelation. Similarly, Adam Kadmon is often referred t o as the “seventy years” of life span. This is because it is the self -perception, the general desire for the whole, which is the source of all of one ’s particular desires. However, although this “desire for a desire” is a creation of something from nothing and is therefore subject to being changed, this desire usually remains concealed , in one ’ s subconscious, as opposed to the actual specific desires for various particular things which actually become revealed , out of this “desire for a desire”. For this reason, Adam Kadmon (the “desire for the desire”) is referred to as the “concealme nt of the ten sefirot of the world of Atzilut (the specific revealed desire ). The Rebbe will now explain this further, and He will explain how the “desire for the desire” is created as “something from nothing”. 7 The Yechidah of the soul."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"matter, it comes out of the aspect of the essence [of his soul] so that he will have an essential and concealed desire, which is the aspect of the af orementioned Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ). 8 However, [this Primal D esire] has not yet become invested within that thing [which he desires at all ], but is rather still [completely ] for himself, as mentioned previously. 9 How ever , when [the Primal Desire] becomes invested [within] and affects a “desire for a d esire” for this particular matter, such as becoming invested within the intellect and thought , to cause a “desire for a desire” for this particular thing, the existence of this desire for this thing wi thin the intellect and thought is like an entire ly new creation from its source. 10 This is because the aforementioned aspect of the Primal Desire is the source for the creation of this “desire for the desire” of the intellect, and this “desire for the desi re” is called a [new ] creation. For, we observe that it is not at all times that a person has a desire for a specific desire, such as the desire for business or for study. 11 It is [therefore] necessary [to state] that there is a sour ce which creates thi s specific desire. 12 [This source] is called “the desire for this [specific ] desire”. 13 It automatically [follows] and is understood , that since the desire for this [specific ] desire is not drawn forth at all times, and furthermore, at times it will radiat e with great strength and light, while at other times it will radiate in a diminished and weak [fashion], therefore, it must be that even the source which makes and brings about this [specific ] desire, this [source] being called the “ desire for the desire ”, also comes about in   8 That is to say , he will have a primal pleasure and desire in kindness (and a distaste in its opposite). 9 In other words, this primal thought is for the pleasure that he will derive, and is not yet a thought of anything outside of the self, whatsoever. An analogy to un derstand this can be seen from a newborn infant. When a child is born, he does not ye t know what food is, and when he cries, he is not actual ly crying for food. Rather, he simply cries out of the pangs of hunger, and the desire and pleasure of being sat ed. We see from this that the primal desire of the child has not yet become invested in an y actual desire for the food itself, but rather , he only desires the pleasure of being sated (the equal opposite of which is the pain of hunger). 10 In other words, w hen a person has a primal pleasure and desire for honor, his “self - perception” of what he thinks will bring him honor is an entirely new creation. That is, how he will perceive himself to be or how he will relate to th e world in order to achieve honor is like a new creation. Now, in human beings, this is not really an entirely new creation, but is rather shaped by the outside influences of the world. For example, if he lives in a society where money and riches are honored, he will form a self perception of himself as wealthy. If he lives in a society where wisdom is honored, he will form a self perception of himself as wise, and have particular desires for wisdom etc. If he moves to a different society where something else is respected, his self -percep tion may change to conform to that. We see that the existence of this secondary desire is not truly intrinsic to the essence of his soul, but rather, it is an entirely new creation which is subject to change. Now, the fact that below , in man , there is an “outside influence” which helps to form this self -perception does not effect the essential point that the self -perception itself does not have intrinsic value, but derives its existence only because the Primal Desire is invested within it and vitalizes it . However, above, in relation to G -d, there are no “outside influence s”. Rather, the opposite is true. B ecause G - d desired to create the world to be something that has the appearance of being “outside” of Himself, He therefore created the “desire for a d esire” for the world. 11 This is to say that the existence of the particular desires is not intrinsic or essential, for if this was the case, they would be constantly desirable and pleasurable. 12 In other words, since they are not intrinsic or essential, th ey obviously are created. 13 It is the “desire for the desire” , the “self - perception” , from which the particular desires come forth into revelation. As mentioned previously, one who perceives himself as “wise” will have particular desires for the study of particular fields of wisdom, while he will have no desire for “u nwise” or “shallow” things, such as comic books. This is true even though his Primal Desire may not be for wisdom at all, but rather for honor."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"an aspect of “something” coming into being from “nothing”. 14 This is co mparable to a bribe, which brings about a co nstant “desire for a desire” to merit [ the briber]. T his is because the bribe touches 15 the essence of his soul. B eca use of this it is constantly drawn out, bringing into being a “desire for a desire” of kindness and merit [towards the briber]. The opposite [is true] in regard to his enemy. A constant “desire for a desire” of judgment wi ll be brought about [towards him] , and the like. This will suffice for those of understanding. 16 Now, as is known, every revealed desire includes ten [ sefirot ]. This being the case, this “desire for the desire” also includes ten [ sefirot within it] . Moreover, [being that] there are ten powers, it automatically follows that that there are ten types o f “desire for desire”, all of which come into being in an aspect of “something” from “nothing”. All this 17 is an example, in order to understand the aspect of the ten sefirot of Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man), which is entirely just the matter of “ a desire for a desire”. 18 This is because the y 19 are the aspect of the concealment of the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut (Emanation) [whereas the ten sefirot of Atzilut ] are revealed [desires], as is known . 20 For example, Keter (desire) of Chochmah (insight) of Atzilut is the desire for intellect. Its source is in Keter (desire) of Chochmah (wisdom ) of Adam Kadmon , which is called “the [hidden] desire for this [revealed] desire”. Likewise, [the r evealed] Keter (desire) of Chessed (kindness) of Atzilut comes from [the concealed] Keter (desire) of Chessed (kindness) of Adam Kadmon etc. 21 However, the coming into being of the ten sefirot of Adam Kadmon , itself , is all drawn from the aspect of the Kav- Line 22 , which is called “The Source of the Coming into being of all   14 In other words his “self perception” and ambi tions do not always shine with the same strength. This is because they are not intrinsic or essential, but are rather the result of constant creation, and are therefore subject to change and exchange. 15 The literal translation here is “reaches”. 16 In trut h, all “desires for desires” (or self -perceptions , if you will , ) are created by a “bribe”. That is to say, they are created by the essential Primal Desires, which are the primal desires for his own pleasures and self interests. It is the primal desire fo r the self which creates and animates one ’ s ge neral self -perception and all his particular desires. This , then , is the explanation of the statement that “a bribe reaches the essence of the soul, thereby constantly drawing forth a desire for a d esire towar ds the briber”. This is to say that the “bribe” is “what is in the self interest and pleasure of his Primal Desire” and therefore constantly brings forth a “desire for a desire” according to that. The opposite is true of things that are not in his self i nterest or pleasure. In such a case, a “desire for a desire” will be constantly drawn forth as well, but in opposition to the object of his displeasure. We see from all of the above that the “desire for the desire” (or self - perception) is like a complete ly new creation which does not “exist” intrinsi cally, but must be constantly brought forth from the Essential Primal Desire. (This is why Adam Kadmon , which is the “desire for the desire”, is called Adam D’Briyah -Man of Creation, because it, literally , is created from the “Nothing” of the Essential Light of the Kav - Line and of the Essential Primal Desire for Himself). 17 The above example of how it is in a human being. 18 In other words , the entire concept of Adam Kadmon is the “self - perception” and “desire for the desire” for the whole of Creation . It includes , albeit in a concealed manner, every particular desire that will come out in th e rest of Creation , from the beginning of creation, until the very end of creation at the end of the world of Asiyah -Actu alization. 19 The “desires for desires” of Adam Kadmon (Primordial Man). 20 For example, one ’s revealed desires are a revelation of how he perceives himself subconscious ly. 21 In other words, the source of the pa rticular desire for a specific intellectual wis dom is in his “desire of the desire/self - perception” of himself as a wise person . Likewise, the desire to d o a particular kindness comes from his self -perception of himself as being a kind person . 22 This actually refers to the Primal Desire - Ratzon HaKadoo m , as mentioned previously (in chapter 17)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Desires for D esires”. This is because it is the essential simple desire , which originated within Himself that it s hould be thus 23 , as mentioned previously. 24 It therefore causes and makes the “desire for desire” [to be] in a particular way. [This principle applies] from the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon until the aspect of Malchut [of Adam Kadmon ], which is the aspect of the “desire for the desire” for Kingship. 25 How ever , the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon only comes about from the last level of the aforementioned Heyulie Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom HaHeyulie ). 26 [ Keter of Adam Kadmon ] is the “desire for the concealed desire” which is higher than the aspect of Chochmah - Wisdom of the “de sire for the concealed desire”. In this manner, all the ten sefirot of Adam Kadmon are in an aspect of concealment. [The sefirot of Adam Kadmon ] are all the [hidden] “desire s for the desire s ” for all the ten sefirot of Atzilut which [themselves] come in an aspect of revelation, as will be explained. 27 This will suffice for those of understanding. This then is the [reason why] the aspect of Adam Kadmon is called “ Adam D’Briyah -Man of Creation”, [for ] it [comes into being] similar to the aspect of the comi ng into being of “ something ” fr om “ nothing ” . We clea rly observe that a “desire for desire” comes into being at specific times , similar to how all other created entities come into being . 28 This is similar to the coming into being of thought, which is a cre ation of “some thing” from “nothing” in comparison to th e essential desire in [a person’s] soul. 29 W e [also] clearly observe that [in   23 In this particular way. 24 In other words, the Primal Desire for the Self is essential and comes from the simple predetermined desire of His Essence, as it radiates with in the light of the Kav -Line (which is dra wn from the Light of the Essence, as explained before). 25 In this paragraph the Rebbe brings out the difference between the analogy of the human being below, and G- d above. That is, by a human being his “self - perception” and “desire for desire” is a ffecte d by outside influences. However, a bove, the “desire for desire” of Adam Kadmon is created according to how G -d, in His Essence, desired to create the w orld. In regard to a human being below, he must formulate a “ desire for a desire ”, because there are ob structions to the immediate fulfillment of his Primal Desire for his Pleasure. However, in regard to G-d, above, there is no such obstruction. Rather, it is necessary to say that He created the “d esire for the desire” because, in Essence , He desired that the world should be created in such a way, i.e. that there should be obstacles to overcome in fulfilling our essential desires. 26 Refer to footnotes 2 & 6 of this chapter. 27 In other words, the sefirot of Adam Kadmon are the “self - perception” for the enti rety of Creation from which all particul ar revealed desires throughout C reation are drawn. Now, in comparison to the revealed desire (the sefirot of Atzilut - Emanation), which is for the external “object” of the desire itself, the desires of Adam Kadmon are still for the Self, i.e. “ self - perception”. Nonetheless, the “self - perception” is the perception of how the self will relate outward, to the external world. Therefore, in comparison to what is above it, the Primal Desire and Pleasure which is entirel y for the self, it is considered to be a completely new creation, as explained above. The concept of “ the revelation of the concealment” will be explained in the next chapter. 28 As explained above, the existence of the “self - perception” is not essential o r intrinsic, but is subject to circumstances and social influences. An analogy for this is like the difference between the desire to live and the desire to work and spend money in order to live and eat. The difference in comparison between them is clearl y understood. The desire to eat and live is intrinsic, essential and constant in comparison to the desire to work. The desire to work is only created by the desire to eat and live, and is entirely dependant upon this desire for its existence. 29 The compa rison to thought is that thoughts are fluid and constantly changing. They are not essential and intrinsic but are rather created , by the desire, as “something” (the tangible) from “nothing” (the intangible). This is likewise the relationship between the Primal Desire for the Self ( Ratzon Kadoom L’Atzmo ) and Adam Kadmon – the “self perception” or “desire fo r desire”. (Moreover, it is specifically thought , which"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"regard to] the “desire for the desire” which comes into an aspect of being, the beginning of its coming into being is specif ically in thought . 30 This is because thought is an aspect of a vessel for the desire , since the desire becomes invested in the thought, as in the verse 31 , “ As I have thought to do”. 32 Similarly, the first existence of the “desire for the desire” is [also] w ithin thought, and is called “the desire which is within thought”. This is the general [explanation] for the matter of Keter (Desire) , Chochmah (Insight) and Binah (Comprehension) of Adam Kadmon . [That is to say,] th is is the aspect of the coming into bei ng and actualization of the light of the “desire for the desire” in a specific manner , as it comes in the “hidden thought” 33 [of Adam Kadmon ]. In contrast, the aspect of the Kav - Line 34 is higher than the actualization of the existence of a “desire for desi re” for a parti cular thing, even in the “hidden thought” . Rather, the thought of everything th at will be , is still entirely for Himself. 35 This is to say that it still includes [everything] in the thought for Himself, and is not an existence of a desire w ithin a thought for anything outside of Himself whatsoever. 36 This will suffice for those of understanding. (In the words of Maimonides 37 , this is “ the knowledge of Himself, rather than a knowledge which is outside of Him self etc ” , as explained elsewhere.) End of Chapter Eighteen       limit s, define s and contain s the desire, thus giving it form etc. Likewise here, it is specifi cally the intellectual Sefirot of Adam Kadmon which define and create the “ image ” of the self, i.e. the self -perception etc. albeit, according to how G -d in Essence desires it .) 30 In other words, it is the first intellectual sefirot of Adam Kadmon which gi ve definition and limitations to the light of the desire , to create and form a self -image and self -perception. 31 Jeremiah 26:3, 36:3 32 This will be explained at great length in chapter 40. 33 The “hidden thought” is to make a distinction between actual reve aled intellectual thought, and the hidden “ subconscious ” thoughts of Adam Kadmon (as will be explained later on in great detail). 34 This refers to the Primal Desire ( Ratzon Kadoom ), as mentioned previously, in chapter seventeen. 35 The analogy for this was given previously as the difference between the desire and pleasure to sit, (for the self) and the desire for a chair, (something external to the self). 36 Because h e knows what his self pleasure is, he also k nows what the external desire for it is . So, as in the above analogy, the person who desires to sit, also desires a chair, and will even know which type of chair will bring him the most pleasure , as well. Nonetheless, the desire for the external chair is , thus far , totally concealed with in the desire o f the self, to sit. Likewise, the Primal Desire and Thought is the Self Knowledge of G -d, of what His E ssential Desire and Pleasure is. It includes everything that will come into revelation, albeit , as of yet it is totally concealed . 37 See Rambam, Hilchot Yesodot HaTorah , Chapter 2, Halachah 9 and 10."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Nineteen We must now understand the source of the ten emanated sefirot [of the world of Atzilut – Emanation]. Their source is from the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon . 1 This is as stated in Etz Chaim Shaar HaKlallim, 2 that Keter of Atik Yomin 3 comes about from the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon. Now, we must first proceed with [ an expl anation of ] the matter of how the ten hidden sefirot which are concealed 4 , come out into revelation. This is the meaning of the verse 5 , “He [who] calls out the generations from the beginning ” , i.e. from the “ head ” 6 of Adam Kadmon etc. 7 Sefer Yetzirah stat es 8 that [the revelation of the conceal ed ] is like “the flame which is bound with the coal” 9 , and there are many similar analogies to this. However, this [concept] may be better understood from the [revelation] of the ten powers of the soul. 10   1 In other words, the source of the sefirot of the world of Atzilut – Emanation is from the end of the “desire for the desire” of Adam Kadmon . As is known, the sefirah of Malch ut – Kingdom is the last sefirah , and corresponds to the faculty of speech or “revelation”. This will be explained later on in great detail. 2 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Seder Atzilut ) Shaar 3, Chapter 1. 3 “ Atik Yomin – The Ancient of Days” is the inner aspec t of Keter of the world of Atzilut and refers to the aspect of “pleasure”, while “ Arich Anpin – The Long Face” is the external aspect of Keter , and refers to the aspect of “desire”. This will all be explained in great detail in chapters 23 & 24. 4 In Hebr ew this is called “ Esser Sefirot HaGnoozot B’He’elem – The Ten Hidden Sefirot which are concealed”. Now, it must be pointed out that this does not refer to the ten concealed sefirot which were mentioned earlier (in chapter 11). Those hidden sefirot are c alled the “ Esser Sefirot HaGnoozot B’He’elem Atzmooto – The Ten Hidden Sefirot which are concealed in the hidden - ness of His Essence”, and refer to the sefirot as they are in the Essence of the Infinite Light. This was explained in chapters 10 and 11. Th e “Ten Hidden Sefirot ” mentioned here do not refer to that, but instead refer to the sefirot as they are in Adam Kadmon . The world of Atzilut – Emanation, is called “the revelation of the concealed” sefirot of Adam Kadmon . In other words, in relation to the world of Atzilut , the sefirot of Adam Kadmon are considered essential and concealed. This will now be explained further. 5 Isaiah 41:4 6 The Hebrew word for “beginning” is “ Rosh – ראש”, which also means “head”. 7 The meaning of this verse will be exp lained later on in the chapter and will become clearly understood. In general though, the difference between Adam Kadmon and the world of Atzilut is the difference between concealment and revelation. Therefore, the general meaning of this verse is that G - d “calls out” the generations from their concealment in Adam Kadmon into revelation in the world of Atzilut – Emanation. 8 See Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7. 9 In other words, when one blows on a lit coal, its flame radiates and becomes reveals tha t the coal is on fire."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" As is know n , the matter of “concealment and revelation ” 11 is unlike the spreading forth of a power from the Essence, such as the power of action wh ich spreads forth in the action, since [in such a case] it is the power of the essence itself [which spreads forth], and is called , “cause and effect”. 12 Rather, it is similar to the aspect of a ray and light 13 of the Essence . This is like the radiance of the rays of light of the sun, 14 or like the life and light of the soul as it is within the vessel of the body , 15 or, it lik e the flash of insight [ as it comes] from the power of conceptualization , 16 and the like. However, a truer analogy for the concept of “ the revelation of the concealed” is like the revelation of movement from a living animal, 17 or like the letters of though t and the letters of speech 18 , and the like. Al l the above are better       10 By understanding how the powers of the soul come out of their concealment into revelation, we will understand how the sefirot of the world of Atzilut – Emanation come into revelation from their concealment in Adam Kadmon . 11 i.e. th e revelation of the concealed. 12 This type of influence is what is called “ Shefa – Influence” and was explained previously, in chapter 9, footnote 10. (Here is the footnote from chapter 9: In order to understand this paragraph, we must first understand th e difference between a “light and ray” and an “influence” of cause and effect. An example of an influence of light is when a person expresses an intellectual thought into speech. Here, there is no change in his intellect at all, and it remains completely whole, as it was before he spoke. His intellect did not diminish whatsoever. Likewise, his speech itself did not diminish, in that he does not run out of words. Furthermore, the recipient of this “light” did not receive the actual light of the intellec t itself, but only its radiance in the speech. The intellect remains where it was the entire time, in the head of the influencer. This is an example of a “light and ray”, which is only a revelation of the essential power, but is not the essential power i tself. In contrast, an example of “influence” of cause and effect is like when one lifts a heavy object. Here, his strength will diminish slowly, and he will not be able to hold it constantly. There is a diminishment from when he picked it up to afterwa rds, and therefore a change. Furthermore, there is a cause and effect here, and therefore when there is a difference in the effect it is due to the difference in the cause etc.) Similarly, the concealed desire of Adam Kadmon , i.e. the “self - perception” i tself does not come forth. (Rather, it is only a revelation and “radiance” of this “self - perception” which becomes revealed in the particular desires of the world of Atzilut .) 13 See previous footnote. 14 That is to say, the light is only a revelation of the luminary, but is not the luminary itself. 15 The fact that the body is alive is only a revelation and indication that the soul is in essence alive. However, the soul as it is vested in the body is not the essence of the soul at all, which is a complet e singularity called the Yechidah – Singular. Rather, it is only a light and ray of the soul, which reveals and indicates upon the essence of the soul, that it is essentially alive. 16 The flash of insight from the power of conceptualization is not a revel ation of the intellect and power of conceptualization itself. Rather it is only a ray of “light” indicating and “shedding light” on the soul’s essential power to conceptualize concepts. 17 The movement of the animal is an indication that it is essentially alive. The reason this analogy and the following analogies are better than the previous analogies is because they bring out the point that the revelation of the essence takes place within something totally separate from the essence itself. For example, t he movement of the animal really has nothing to do with the essential life of the animal but is only an indication and revelation of the fact that the animal is alive. (Likewise, the revelation of the essential desire is in something separate and “outside ” of the essence. This is to say that the essential desire and even the “desire for the desire”, is still a desire which is entirely for the self, while the revealed particular desires are for something separate and “outside” of the self, and are only an indication and revelation of the essential desire for the self.) 18 In other words, when one conveys an intellectual concept in his speech, this is not his intellect at all, but is only a revelation that he possesses intellect. His intellect itself was not revealed whatsoever. Likewise, when one thinks a concept, it is only a revelation of his essential power to conceptualize concepts, but is"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"[analogies ] than the analogy of the flame which is bound up, in a hidden fashion , with the coal. For although the flame was indee d in the coal in a hidden fashion , nonetheless, the flam e came out of the essential heat of the coal, and this is thus not a true comparison to the concept of “revelation”. 19 [This is because , “the revelat ion of the hidden”] is merely like the aspect of an appearance or a color, such as the color of an apple wh ich is not essential to the apple [itself] , as is known. 20 This is likewise the case with the revelation of the concealed essential powers of the soul , such as the power of the quality of Chessed - Kindness, as it is in the essence. Its revelation is when a desire and intellect for kindness a nd goodness is constantly brought into being bec ause of this essential quality of the essence of the soul. 21 The opposite is true of s omeone whose essential quality is cruelty. [In such a person] a desire and intellec t for judgment and punish ment is brought into being . Now, the coming into being of the source of this desire 22 for [either] kindness or judgment is still considered to be [ part and parcel] of the essential quality, and is altogether not separate from it . 23 However, the revealed desires for judgment or its opposite, which are born [of the “desire for the desire” ], are merely like a revealed indication of the essence. This may be compared to the revealed movement [which comes] from the [power of movement in the] essence of the animal, or to the revealed life force [of the soul as it exists] in a separate thing, i.e. the [physical] body. This is to say that because he is essentially alive, he reveals his life force in [physical] movement. Moreover, because he is essentially a living being , he [therefor e] also enlivens the inanimate body. [The physical life] is called “ Chayei Ba ssar - the       not a revelation of this essential power itself. Rather, it is only its radiance and light, as it is revealed in h is thoughts. That is, these thoughts are only an indication of his essential power of conceptualization, but not the power of conceptualization itself. Moreover, the letters of thought and the letters of speech are incidental to the concept and are not es sential to it. That is to say, one person may explain a certain concept using certain words, while another person will explain the very same concept, and even convey the very same explanation, using entirely different words. 19 Here, the Rebbe is not negat ing the analogy of Sefer Yetzirah , but is only clarifying it. In other words, at first glance the analogy may be misunderstood, and one may come to think that the revelation of the ten sefirot of Atzilut from the concealment of Adam Kadmon is in the way o f a “ Shefa - Influence” (which was explained in footnote 11 and chapter 9). When the analogy is explained, its proper intent is understood, as will be seen later in this chapter. 20 This is to say that the color is incidental to the apple and is not essentia l to it, nor does it affect the flavor. Nonetheless, the color of the apple is an indication and revelation of its sweetness and ripeness. 21 In other words, when a person constantly does acts of kindness etc, this is an indication that in essence he is ki nd. That is, his revealed desires indicate his essential characteristics and qualities. Likewise, when a person constantly does acts of cruelty, this is an indication that in essence he is cruel. 22 This refers to the “desire for the desire”, the self -perc eption, which comes from the essential qualities. 23 This is because even the self -perception is still entirely for the self . This is to say that it is not yet focused out of the self, to be expressed in something external. Therefore, it too is considered to be one with the essential desire from which it comes. This is in contrast to the revealed desires, which are the desires for something “outside” the self. (For example, there is the (essential) primal desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), which is the desire for his pleasure. Then there is the “desire for the desire”/the self -perception of Adam Kadmon, which is like the desire and thought of himself sitting. Then there is the revealed desire of Atzilut , which is like the desire for the chair. The differences b etween these three levels, is self evident.)"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"life of the flesh” etc . [Similarly ,] the revelation of desire comes into a separat e thing, which is this [above mentioned ] matter of [either] kindness or judgment. 24 However, the source 25 that gives rise to this des ire comes from the power of the essential quality alone. 26 [We] automatically understand [from this] that since there are many different types of things, a specifi c desire will be born for each of them from a single source , which at all times is depend ant upon the essential quality . Similarly, [when one ’ s] inte llect constantly leans towards a desir e [for] kindness, this is only beca use of [his] essential quality of kindness, which constantly gives rise , specifically, to a desire and int ellect for kindness . Because there are many different separate things [through which this kindness may be expressed, therefore,] an individual desire and intellect is born [from the same essential source] for each one [in and of] itself. This will suffice for those of understanding. 27 We [therefore] find that the general “desire for the desire” for kindness can bring forth many different particular desires for kindness, in many very different matters and ways. [Nonetheless,] they all are from one source , this being the concealed desire, which is called , “T he essential desire for kindness ” , [which comes about] because of the essential Heyulie quality [of kindn ess in the essence of the soul]. However, [this essential Heyulie quality] comes [to be expressed] in a specific way, to be this [specific] “desire for the desire” for this specific thing. This will suffice for those of understanding. However, it is nevertheless understood that there is a great difference between [the concealed desire of Adam Kadmon and] the revelation of the desire for kindness [of Atzilut ] which is merely the aspect of a “ revelation of the concealment” of th e essential desire, which arouses this [specific ] desi re. [In contrast, the concealed desire of Adam Kadmon ] comes from the power of the essential quality [of the Self], and is not an aspect of a “separate thing”. 28 This will suffice for those of understanding.   24 Just as in the above analogies, the revelation is merely an indication of the essence and is actually something “separate” from the essence itself, so too, the revealed desire is not the essential or concealed desire itself, but rather, it actually is invested within something “separate” from the essential desire. Nonetheless, it is a “revelation” and indication of the essential desire etc. 25 This refers to the “desire for the desire”/self -perception of Adam K admon . 26 This is to say that although in comparison to the essential primal desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), the “desire for the desire” ( Adam Kadmon ) is considered to be like a new creation. Nonetheless, in truth, it is still entirely focused on the self (i.e. self -perception) and is not yet a desire for something external to the self. 27 Because there are many different external matters through which the “desire for the desire”/self - perception may be expressed, a specific desire will be born for each of these sp ecific matters. Nonetheless, all the revealed desires come from one source, which is the “desire for the desire”/self -perception. An example of this is someone who is essentially kind. His essential kindness can be expressed in any number of different w ays. He may give food to a poor person, he may give him money, or he may speak kind words to him etc. All of these different desires and external acts of kindness, come from the same source, which is his “desire for the desire”/self -perception of kindnes s, which, in turn, is bound up with his essential quality of being kind. 28 This is to say that in Adam Kadmon the desire is firstly for the self, and it is secondly a holistic desire of the whole, from which the external particulars have not yet been revea led. In contrast, Atzilut is the revelation of the external particulars of that whole. The analogy of the difference between the two was given in footnote 22 of this chapter. (Moreover, the “desire for the desire”/self -perception of Adam Kadmon is creat ed by the Essence of G -d, exactly according to how He estimated would be necessary within His Essence, and is the general desire for all of Creation, as a whole.)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Now, the matter of “He calls out the generatio ns from the head of Adam Kadmon etc” may be understood according to the above analogies. This is analogous to one who calls out to something to come out from its concealment to be reve aled outside. Likewise, the main matter of the aspect of the ten sefir ot of [the world of] Atzilut - Emanation, is only that they come out from being concealed and become reve aled . 29 This is why they are called by the term s, “Lights - Orot ” or “Emanations - Sefirot ”, [in that they are] similar to a ray and a light . 30 This is simila r to any aspect of the “revelation of the concealed” in that it is only an aspect of light, or only like the aspect of an indication [of the Essence] , [such as the ] color [of an apple] . [In other words,] it is like the movement of an animal [which is mere ly an indication that in essence, it is alive] etc. Moreover, t his is the meaning [of the word Atzilut - Emanation ,] as in [the verse] 31 , “And He emanated from the spirit” , which was not the [actual] spirit of Moshe [itself] . 32 Rather, it was only a n aspect of a revelation of his light and ray , which spread f orth and emanated, similar to a flame [ which emanates] from a coal 33 , and the like. All this may be understood according to the aforementioned analogy regarding the matter of [how] the desire becomes reve aled in a separat e thing. That is, it emerges from the concealment o f the essential desire, according to [his ] es sence, as mentioned previously. Likewise, the aspect of the Ketarim 34 (Crowns) of [the world of] Atzilut -Emanation, is only the aspect of the revelation of the desire, in comparison to the concealed essential desire [itself], which is called “the desire for the desire”, this being the aspect of Adam Kadmon , as previously explained. For example, the revealed desire for kindness of Atzilut which is called Keter of Chessed , is drawn from the aspect of the concealed desire for kindness of Adam Kadmon . 35 Likewise, [the revealed desire for wisdom ( Chochmah ) of Atzilut is drawn ] from the aspect of the concealed desire of Chochmah [of Adam Kadmon ]. 36 However, just as it is understood from the aforementioned analogy that the existence of what is called “the desire for the desire” comes as an aspect of a “general [desire]” , which “gives birth” to many d ifferent [particular] desires and many different matt ers and ways,   29 In other words, in Adam Kadmon the particular desires are concealed in the general desire f or the whole of Creation. In Atzilut the particulars desires themselves come into revelation. 30 That is, it is not the “general” whole desire of Adam Kadmon itself which comes out into revelation, but rather, it is only a “revelation” and indication of th e concealed desire of Adam Kadmon , which becomes revealed in Atzilut . (See also footnote 11 of this chapter.) 31 Beha’alotcha 11:25. 32 This is referring to when G - d emanated a spirit of prophecy upon the seventy elders, from Moshe’s spirit of prophecy. Th ey did not receive Moshe’s own spirit of prophecy but only an “emanation” thereof. Moreover, this is attested to by the fact that Moshe’s spirit of prophecy was not diminished in any way whatsoever as a result of this revelation and emanation. This is be cause the emanation of his spirit of prophecy was only in the way of a “light and ray”, which was explained previously. Likewise, the revelation of Atzilut from the concealment of Adam Kadmon is only in the way of a “light and ray”, and it is for this rea son that the world of Atzilut -Emanation is called this name. 33 When one lights something else from the flame of the coal, the flame of the coal is in no way diminished. 34 This is plural for the sefirah of Keter – Crown, and as previously mentioned, the sef irah of Keter corresponds to the faculty of desire. 35 The desire to do a particular act of kindness is drawn into revelation from the hidden desire to be kind. 36 The desire to study a particular wisdom is drawn into revelation from the concealed desire to be wise."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"likewise, many different types of revealed desires for kindness of [the world of] Atzilut are “b orn ” from the aspect of the “desire for the desire of kindness” of Adam Kadmon . The [explanation of the] matter is that from the aspect of the Ma lchut 37 of a [particula r] quality of Adam Kadmon , comes about the aspect of the Keter of that quality of Atzilut . Ho wever, [when speaking] of the ten sefirot generally , it is only from the [general] aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon that the [general] Keter of [the world of] Atzilut is made. This is to say that it is only from the “letters” and revelation of the concealed essential desire that the essential light of the revealed desire is made. 38 (This bears a similar ity to what was explained in chapter eig hteen, that the “ desire for the desire”, i.e. the sefirot of Adam Kadmon , is only made from the aspect of the “end action” of the “E ssential [Primal] Desire ” -[ Ratzon HaKadoom ].) (By way of analogy, [this is like] the revelation of the desire in the speech 39 of the influencer, which becomes the essential de sire of the recipient. Similarly , i t is like how the letters that reveal the intellect in the speech of the influencer , become the essential intellectual light of the recipient. Likewise, the light of the desire for k indness in the recipient, only comes about from the letters and revelation of kindness in the speech of the influencer. As is known regarding every [type of] cause and effect, the root and beginning of the effect is made from the last level of the cause. Similarly, Keter of Atik Yomin 40 [of Atzilut ] is made from the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon . In other words, the source of revelation of the desire which results from pleasure , which is called Atik Yomin , as will be explained, is made onl y from the revelation of the “desire for the desire” in “speech”. ) This is the general [explanation] of the matter of the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut , which came out of the concealment of the ten sefirot of Adam Kadmon , as stated, “He calls out the generations from the head” [of Adam Kadmon ] etc. End of Chapter Nineteen   37 The sefirah of Malchut (Kingdom) will be ex plained in great detail later in the book. However, i n general , it represents the “letters” of revelation of any particular sefirah or world (and is therefore generally compared to speech). For exampl e, Malchut of Chessed of Adam Kadmon represents the tangible “letters” of the desire to be kind as it is in the self perception. It is the letters of the “desire to be kind”, which becomes the inner light of Keter of Chessed of Atzilut , which is the desir e to do a particular kind act. 38 When speaking in general terms , the Keter of the lower world comes from the Malchut of the upper world. Therefore, it is not incorrect to say that Malchut of Adam Kadmon becomes Keter of the world of Atzilut. However, more particularly speaking , the general sefirah of Malchut of any world is made up from the Malchut of each particular sefirah of that world. For example, Malchut of Chessed of Adam Kadmon becomes Chessed of Malchut of Adam Kadmon . Likewise, Malchut of Choch mah of Adam Kadmon becomes Chochmah of Malchut of Adam Kadmon . Then, the particular sefirot of Malchut (which are all the particular Malchut’s of the sefirot of that world) become the Keter of the lower world. So for example, from the Chochmah of Malchu t of Adam Kadmon is drawn the Keter of Chochmah of Atzilut . Likewise, from the Chessed of Malchut of Adam Kadmon is drawn the Keter of Chessed of Atzilut . Therefore, when speaking particularly, it is from the Malchut of an quality of Adam Kadmon which be comes the Keter of that attribute of Atzilut . (In simpler terms, particularly speaking, it is from the desire to be kind of the “self - perception” that there comes the desire to do a particular kind act etc.) The sefirah of Malchut will be explained later in the book. 39 As mentioned previously, the sefirah of Malchut is compared to the revelation of speech. 40 As was mentioned previously and as will soon be explained, Atik Yomin is the inner aspect of Keter of the world of Atzilut -Emanation (and corresponds to the pleasure of the desire)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Now, before the details of the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut can be expla ined, we must preface [by explain ing ] the matter of Nekudah -Point, Sefirah - Emanation, and Partzuf - Stature. 1 As is known, the general difference between the aspect of Tohu (Chaos) and the aspect of Tikkun (Rectification) is that the ten sefirot of Tohu (Ch aos) are only in an aspect of “points” , which are the aspects of the Ketarim 2 (Desires ). 3 [In contrast,] in the world of Tikkun - Rectification , the [ sefirot ] come in an aspect of division in which each sefirah [is divided] into ten, and therefore, the aspe ct of “Rectificati on” automatically comes about . 4 This is the inter -inclusion [of the sefirot ] by means of the name of 45 ( Ma”H – מ \" ה ). 5 Now, the explanation of these matters is known , that the aspect of Nekudot -Points is the aspect of an es sence before it spreads forth. This is similar to a point , which does not spread forth. An example [of this] is the light of the quality of Ch essed - Kindness . The aspect of the essen tial quality of kindness is the aspect of its Keter (Desire). 6 However, what is meant here is not the aspect of the essential quality of Chessed - Kindness as it is embedded and rooted with in the essence of the soul, which is called the Yechidah (Singular) , as mentioned previously , s ince [the way it exists embedded in the essence of the soul] is [still] totally in an aspect of a Heyulie, (as mentioned previously in chapters 10 and 11). Rather, what is meant here is in regard to the aspect of the revelation of the desire for a particular [act of]   1 In Kabbalistic texts these three aspects are often referred to as Akoodim , Nekoodim and Beroodim , as will be explained shortly. 2 Ketarim is pl ural for Keter – Crown, which is the aspect of pleasure and desire. 3 That is to say, the aspect of Tohu – Chaos is the revelation of the essential desire, as it is in essence. As will be explained, since they are absolutes, one essential desire cannot co mpromise and become coexist with its opposite. 4 This is because each particular sefirah contains something of its opposite within it and therefore strikes a sympathetic chord with it. For example Chessed – Kindness contains ten sefirot , including Gevurah - Might, and can therefore be joined with it etc. 5 As previously explained, the name of Ma”H (45) represents the aspect of sublimation to G -dliness, as in the verse, “ V’Nachnu Mah – And what are we”. As mentioned previously, the “inner” name of 45 ( Ma”H ) is the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light - Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof as it is revealed in the Kav -Line. It is through the sublimation of the qualities of Tikkun to G -d that they do not oppose and negate each other. This is because, in their true esse ntial source, in the Essence of G -d, they are not in conflict and are actually, literally as one (as explained in chapters 10 and 11). This is also, as is explained elsewhere, the reason why the angels of kindness (the camp of Michael ) and the angels of j udgment (the camp of Gavriel ) do not clash and destroy each other. It is solely because of their sublimation to their common and essential source in G -d. 6 The desire for kindness is the essential light and motivation of all that follows after it."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"kindness, [ as it becomes revealed] from its concealment in the essential Heyulie of kindness. [Now], e ven this [revealed] desire has not yet spread forth [ from its essential s tate ]. Rather, it [exists] as it is, beyond 7 reason whatsoever for this desire, [such as the reason for ] why he desires to reveal kindness etc. Certainly, [as of yet], there are no divisions into the various differe nt ways [that this kindness may be expre ssed]. Even if his intellect leans specifically to Chessed - kindness, [nonetheless] it is not divided into different ways [of how the kindness will come out]. [This is because ] although the [aspect] of intellect which leans essentially towards kindness an d merit is the aspect of the Chochmah (Insight ) of the essential Chessed (Kindness), nonetheless, it too , is only in an aspect of a Nekudah -Point. 8 Likewise, [the aspect of] the Netzach (Conquest) of this Chessed (Kindness) [also] comes in the way of a Ne kudah -Point. 9 We [therefore] find that though the aspect of the essential kindness which comes into revelation , includes ten [ sefirot within it , i.e.] desire, intellect and emotions, n onetheless, there are no recognizable divisions with in them . Rather , t hey are all [included] in an aspect of a single point. This is the aspect of Akudim -Boun d 10 , wherein [the sefirot ] were all bound up in a single vessel. It is because of this that the aspect of the ten sefirot of Tohu -Chaos can not unite or become inter -inc luded with one another. Rather, they are [ disjointed points,] one beneath the other , as stated, “He r eigned and he died etc” . 11   7 The t ext reads “without reason”. Nonetheless, it is without reason because at this point it is “beyond” reason. 8 This is to say that although the desire possesses ten sefirot , they are all completely bound up with the desire, and are “enslaved” and controlled by it. Therefore, the intellect of the desire is not really a rational objective intellect, but is, rather, driven to support and facilitate the desire. The same holds true of all of the other qualities and faculties of Tohu – Chaos. They are all bound up with the desire and enslaved by it. 9 The same holds true of all the particular sefirot of the essential desires of Tohu - Chaos. They are all bound up with the desire and are completely enslaved to it. 10 The two levels of the world of Tohu , plus the l evel of the world of Tikkun correspond to the three worlds of Akudim, Nekudim and Brudim . These terms, which mean “bound”, “speckled” and “splotched”, have their source in the Torah account of how Lavan (Leah and Rachel’s father) tried to swindle Yaakov ou t of the wages due him for tending Lavan’s flock. After working without pay for fourteen years in return for marrying his daughters, Lavan agreed that Yaakov would rece ive his payment with those goats that were born with “bands” around their ankles ( Akudim ), small speckles ( Nekudim ) or large splotches ( Brudim ). These Torah terms hint at the three above mentioned levels of Nekudah, Sefirah and Partzuf. The term Akudim (bands) represents the level of Nekudah, in which the sefirot are all “bound” up in a sin gle vessel and are thus indistinguishable from each other. They are all expressed in the essential desire, such as the essential desire for kindness, for example, similar to a band which is circular, representing that it is bound up within itself. The smal l speckles ( Nekudim ) represent the level of sefirah , in which the particular divisions of each sefirah are recognizable, but nonetheless, remain disjointed and do not interconnect to work in conjunction as a unified system. The large splotches ( Brudim ) rep resent the level of Partzuf, in which the sefirot are recognizable as distinct qualities, but nonetheless, unite and connect to work in conjunction as a unified system. This is comparable to the merging of many specks into one large splotch. 11 This verse r efers to the eight Kings of Edom, who were the descendants of Esav, the brother of Yaakov. Esav and Yaakov represent the two worlds of Tohu – Chaos, and Tikkun – Rectification. In Kabbalah, these eight Kings are referred to as the “Kings of Tohu ”. Becau se these are the “Kings of Tohu ”, the one must die before the other can reign. This is because the essential points of the world of Tohu are incompatible with each other, and cannot coexist. For example, in Tohu the essential desire for kindness, though i t is compos ed of intellect and emotions, cannot join with the essential desire for sternness. This is so even though sternness too, is composed of intellect and emotions. The reason for this is because the intellect and emotions of the desire to be kind ar e absolute kindness and exist solely to justify the kindness,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" An example of this is an essential desire for kindness which comes into revelation. Alth ough it includes intellect etc, noneth eless, it cannot join with an essential desire which is its opposite , [such as an essential desire] that comes in an aspect of judgment . [This is the case ] even though it too includes intellect, [albeit, one] which essentially leans towards judgment. Thi s is because they do not have a vessel within which two [essential] opposites , such as these , can become inter -included. We can tangibly observe that a person whose intellect essentially leans towards kindness cannot , in any way , tolerate his opponent, wh o is a person whose intellect essentially leans towards judgment. (This is analogous to the debates between the academies of Shammai and Hillel, and the like. 12 Even if his opponent pose s difficult questions [on his views], which he is unable to logical ly answer , he will remain silent , but he will [find it] impossible to ack nowledge [the correct ness of his opponent’s opinion]. [Neither will he be able] to retract [his opinion] and align himself with the opposite view , whatsoever. 13 ) However, the aspect of Tikkun - Rectification is when a quality comes to spread forth from its [essential] point ( Nekudah ), outside of its essential desire and intellect. In other words, this is like when the attribute of Chessed - Kindness gives rise to a desire and intellect to have a kind disposition towa rd his fellowman , [specifically] because he did him a favor . [This is to say that ] it is not because his [own] essential goodness and kindness becomes reve aled, as a necessary consequence of the natural goodness in the essence of his soul. On the contrar y, he may be cruel by nature . However, he will desire to do [acts of] goodness to someone who was gracious to him and who saved him from death, or the like . [Moreover,] his intellectu al disposition towards him will always lean towards [thoughts of] kindness and merit , and the like . This is called composite kindness a nd goodness. It is not at all the simple ess ential kindness which stems from his [essential] nature. The same [principle] is true of the opposite [quality] , whic h is the composite quality of judgment. Towards his enemy , who has done him much harm , his desire and in tellect will lean towards [judging him as being ] guilt y, eve n though he [himself] may be a kind and merciful person in his essential nature . Accordingl y, it is understood that there are many different ways in which the composition [of one’ s desire s] are formed, according to the composition of his emotions towards [any given] thing. This is like love or hate which are dependent upon something, as mention ed       whereas the intellect and emotions of the desire to be stern are absolutely stern and exist solely to justify the sternness. Because they are absolute opposites, they are incompatible with each other and cannot coexist simultaneously. The one must be destroyed before the other can be revealed. This brin gs about chaos, and is called “T he death of the kings of Tohu ”. The breakdown of the sefirot of Tohu is referred to as the “ Shevirat HaKelim – T he Shattering of the Vessels” , and will be discussed later in the book. 12 Now, it must be pointed out that the example of the disputes between the academies of Shammai and Hillel is not a true example of the breakdown in Tohu – Chaos. This is because altho ugh their views essentially differed from each other, even in regard to the practical application of certain commandments, nonetheless, when it came to actual the fulfillment of the commandments , they followed the view of the majority, as Jewish Law ( Halac ha ) prescribes. However, this is not the case in regard to the “Kings of Tohu”, in which there is no possibility of compromise and cooperation. The one essential desire must “die” before the other one can “reign”. 13 This shows that the intellect is not a true intellect but is completely bound up with the point of the essential d esire."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"above. It is therefore possible to find something that , from one angle , he loves, and his desire and intellect are entirely for goodness and kindness [towards that thing] , while from another angle of the very same thing itself, he hates it. [This is t o say that ] his desire and intellect is turned towards harm ing and punishing [the very same thing]. [Because of this,] it is possible for there to be an intermediary [comp osite ] aspect, which includes Chessed - Kindness and Gevurah -Judgment together as one . This is in accordance with the statement 14 , “[In the same matter] where His judgment is, [there He en umerates good deeds]”, in regard to King Saul who killed the Gibeonites. [Simultaneously, King David was reprimanded] for not properly eulogizing [King S aul]. [This is an example of] two opposites at once. 15 Similarly, regarding King Solomon’s marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh it states 16 , “My anger has been aroused etc”. However, Song of Songs was said in reference to [G - d’s] joy over the building of t he Holy Temple, as stated, 17 “On the day of the joy of His heart”. [This is an example of] joy and anger, one thing and its opposite, as one. 18 Similarly, [regarding the flood] it states 19 , “[I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake;] for the impulse of man’s heart is evil from his youth.” However, previously it wa s stated, 20 “ And G -d saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, [and that all the impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.] And G -d repented [fo r having made man on earth] etc.” 21 As is ex plained elsewhere, all of this comes about from the aspect of the qualities of Tikkun - Recti fication, which are composite aspects . In other words, they spread fort h [outside of their essence ] and do not result fr om the essential [nature] alone. 22 Therefore , it is possible for there to be an inter -inclusion of one thing with its opposite. In contrast, [regarding] the Nekudah -Point of Tohu -Chaos; even when it is made into a division of ten [ sefirot ], [nonetheless] it is only [ in the aspect of] a Sefirah -Emanation. 23   14 See Tractate Yevamot 78b, Rashi there. Also see Tzefanya 2:3. 15 In other words, both judgment and kindness were shown toward a single individual, King Saul. 16 Jeremiah 32 :31, also see Tractate Nidda 70b. 17 See Zohar, Terumah 143a. 18 The verse regarding G - d’s anger actually states, “My anger and my fury has been aroused from the day that they built it etc.” The Talmudic Sages stated that this refers to King Solomon’s marri age to the daughter of Pharaoh. However, it was King Solomon who built the Temple, and about that G -d was joyous. These are two opposites towards a single individual. 19 Genesis 8:21 20 Genesis 6:5,6 21 In other words, G -d desired to destroy the earth and br ought about the flood because “man is evil” etc. However it was for this very same reason that G - d said he will never again destroy the earth, because “m an is evil” etc. Here, we see two opposites results from the very same matter . 22 Because of this the qualities of Tikkun are objective and rational, as opposed to the qualities of Tohu, which are subjective and irrational. 23 See footnote 8. The difference between the Nekudah and Sefirah can be understood in the following manner. Because the Nekudah (Poi nt) is an essential, undiluted desire, it becomes completely irrational , often bringing about the opposite of the desired effect. As a result, each desire must be completely eradicated before it can be replaced by a different one. An example of this princi ple is the case of a very narrow minded person who is incapable of compromise. When such a person is kind, his kindness knows no restraint. He will be indiscriminately kind to everyone and he will be excessive in this kindness. Eventually, though, his kind ness will, of necessity, break down because he will find himself being severely taken advantage of, and will become completely drained, both monetarily and emotionally. Such a person might then swing to the opposite extreme, becoming overly suspicious of o thers, excessively callous of"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"[However,] it is not a Partzuf Adam -Stature of Man, wherein there is the aspect of the inter - inclusion of all opposites. 24 Rather, it is specifically in the aspect of Tikkun -Rectification, in which each point spread s forth , out of its essence, that they can become inter -included through the abundance of many different vessels , within which they are composed. 25 This will suffice for those of understanding. This , then , is [the meaning of] the statement in Sefer Yetzirah , “He took fire an d water and mixed them one with the other”. In other words, [this is] the aspect of the composition of fire and water [together], specifically not [as they are ] their essential state, 26 as explained elsewhere at length.         their needs and extremely unkind. This approach too, will eventually break down, when people begin disliking and avoiding him because of his mean spirit. The above principle applies when the desire comes in the form of an ess ential point, in which the intellect and emotions are “slaves” that are “driven” to fulfill it in an absolute manner in which there are no compromises. This may be compared to the uncompromising fanaticism of a Moslem fundamentalist terrorist who is hell bent on pushing his agenda no matter what the outcome. This level of Tohu is called Nekudah (Point). Besides the Nekudah (Point) there is another level in Tohu, called Sefirah . This is when the point divides into ten recognizable traits. Because of this , there is the appearance of rational behavior. It appears to be an objective, reasonable intellect which is open to compromise. In truth , however , here too the intellect, emotions and actions exist merely to facilitate the desire that drives them. An ex ample of this is a Christian missionary. He talks and acts as if he is an objective, reasonable person, but in reality he is neither reasonable nor objective. In reality he is completely bent on converting you to his religion and his speech and actions a re there merely to facilitate this. This is why he knocked on your door in the first place. Though it appears that a reasonable conversation is taking place, if he is refuted in debate, he will automatically revert back to the essential point of the irra tional desire in which there is no compromise and no recognizable intellect at all, such as saying, “It is true because I know it in my heart”, etc. In summary, Tohu is when the light (revelation) of the desire is too strong for the vessels and overpowers them, so that they can no longer be objective but rather become completely unrestrained and driven by the desire. 24 Tikkun (rectification) is also called by the term Partzuf , which means “face” or “personality” . This is because in Tikkun there are recogn izable divisions of the sefirot into ten, each of which is divided into subsequent divisions of ten etc . The concept of a partzuf is the inclusion of all opposites , like a human being, who has many facets to his personality, all of which join to make him who and what he is. Besides this, his physical body too is made up of many parts with different and even opposite natures and functions, and yet, not only do they not contradict each other, but they work in conjunction as a unified system. Each organ perfo rms the function it is suited for while allowing the others to perform their function. Furthermore, in order to perform properly, every organ depends on the others for its health and vitality, for example, if a person has nagging foot pains, this will affe ct his brain and he will have difficulty concentrating on his studies. This mutual coexistence and symbiosis is not possible in Tohu , where the sefirot exist as pure essences and are therefore incompatible with their counterparts. It is specifically in tikkun that mutual coexistence and symbiosis can exist, since in tikkun each point comes about as an extension outside of its essence. It is specifically then that they can be included one with the other through the many various types of vessels for expressi on, of which they are composed etc. The vessel integrates something of each sefirah (as will be explained later) . This being the case, they all find expression in it. 25 See previous footnote. This will be understood more clearly later in the book, with a thorough explanation of the inter -inclusion of the vessels. 26 As they exist essentially, it is impossible for these two opposites to coexist. However, the physical water which we have in our world is a composite which possesses something of the element o f fire within it. Likewise, physical fire possesses something of the element of water within it. In truth, it would be impossible for a physical world to exist, altogether, from the essential desires of Tohu – Chaos. (This is as explained by the Ari’zal and the Alter Rebbe that the statement that “G -d created worlds and destroyed them” refers not to the physical world, which is a composite world, the source of which is Tikkun -"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"   End of Chapter Twenty       Rectification, but rather, it refers to the worlds of Tohu – Chaos, in which on e sefirah cannot coexist with the other and therefore each sefirah must “die” before the next one can “reign”, as previously explained.) Rather, our physical world is a composite world, in which all the sefirot are interr elated and interdependent and, therefore, one sefirah and its opposite can join."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty One With all of the above [in mind ], the general matter of the inter -inclusions o f the three emanated lines may be understood. [The sefirot of] Chochmah, Chessed and Netzach are to the right, Binah, Gevurah and Hod are to the left, and Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod are in the middle. 1 [Now,] it is stated in Pardes 2 that the inner aspect o f Keter , which is called Keter of Keter , is not divided into three lines. [It is only from] the external aspect of [ Keter ] that the three lines separate. [In other words, it is] from the aspect of Chochmah of Keter [that a distinction of three lines begi ns] , as is known regarding the [Kabbalistic] intentions of [the words] “The Great, The Mighty and The Awesome” 3 etc. The explanation of these matters is that the aspect of the inter -inclusions of the right and left lines [one with the other] is specifical ly by means of the middle line. The [explanation of the] matter is that in the right line of ChaCha”N, 4 Chessed – Kindness is an offshoot of Chochmah – Insight , but is [nonetheless] separate from it. 5 This may be [understood by] the fact that Chessed – Kindness, is an offshoot of [ Chochmah , which is the] intellect a nd reasoning which leans to kindness to ward something separate 6 , as mentioned previously. Similarly,   1 These three lines are known in Kabbalah and Chassidut by their abbreviations. Chochmah, Chessed and Netzach are called ChaCha”N . Binah, Gevurah and Hod are called BoGa”H . Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod are known as DaTi”Y . (It is this configuration of the sefirot into three lines, right, left and middle, which is usually depicted as “The Tree of Life”. This configuration of the thre e lines of the sefirot as they are inter - included, is generally called the ten sefirot of Yosher .) 2 See Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, Shaar HaTzinorot . 3 See the beginning of Amidah prayer. As mentioned previously, “The Great – HaGadol ” repres ents Chessed (Kindness) to the right, “The Mighty – HaGibor ” represents Gevurah (Might/Judgment) to the left, and “The Awesome” represents the median conduct, the middle line which synthesizes the right and the left, which is Tiferet (Beauty/Mercy). 4 This is an acronym for Chochmah, Chessed and Netzach . See footnote 1. 5 This is to say that although Chessed – Kindness is an offshoot of the holistic perception of Chochmah – Insight, nonetheless, Chessed, which is the emotion of Kindness, is an entirely dif ferent matter than Chochmah . 6 The literal translation of “something separate” is “a composite”. This is in contrast to the simple essential desire mentioned in the previous chapter. In that case, it is not the “separate” object which forms the emotions and desire towards it, but rather, the simple essential desire forms the emotions and desire towards it. However, here, this is a composite desire, that is, his emotions are born out of his connection to the separate object itself, rather than from his es sential desire. In other words, he is objective rather than subjective. Now, because Chochmah , which is the intuitive flash of insight, views things in a holistic fashion, it will therefore tend to lean toward kindness. For instance, in judging someone in a court case, if we look at the whole person, such as his upbringing, social status and environment etc., rather than only scrutinizing the details of the crime, in the majority of cases, we will tend to view him more kindly and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Netzach – Conquest is an offshoot of Chessed , but is [nonetheless] separate from it. This is to say that the quality of kindness necessitates the aspect of triumph, in order to bring the kindness to actualization etc . 7 [On the other hand] t he left line [of BoGa”H 8 ] is the opposite [of the above]. For ex ample, the [emotional] quality of judgme nt branches out from an intellect which leans towards judgment. In this manner Binah [gives rise to] Gevurah , as stated, 9 “I am Binah , Gevurah is mine”. 10 [For, as is known,] Chochmah leans towards kindness, while judgments are aroused from Binah . 11 (This accords with the statement in Etz Chaim that Abba (Father) is the source of the kindnesses and Imma (Mother) is the source of the judg ments, as is known. 12 ) Now, the aspect of the inter -inclusion of these two [opposite] lines, so that they come to be conn ected [and synthesized] as one, is by means of the middle line of DaTi”Y . 13 For example, Da’at 14 is the aspect of the median [conduct] which tips [the mind] from intellectual kindness to intellectual sternness , and is [therefore] called “ The L eaning Da’at ”. 15 (For example, [the verse , 16 “I will not continue to curse the earth because of mankind, ] because the inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth, [I will, therefore, not continue to punish any living thing, as I had done etc ” ] becomes an intell ectu al reasoning for merit, though at first, this very same i ntellectual [reasoning] leaned toward judgment, as stated, 17 “And G -d saw that the wickedness of man was great [in the earth, and that all the impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil contin ually. And G -d repented that he had made man on       favorably. From this we se e that Chessed is an offshoot of the holistic perception of Chochmah . Nonetheless, as mentioned above, Chessed is an entirely different matter than Chochmah . 7 Ches sed (Kindness) is the quality of expansive and abundant spreading forth of influence. Sinc e Netzach is the quality of Conquest, which is the matter of spreading forth by expanding the borders of his influence, we see that it is an offshoot of Ches sed . But, on the other hand, it is an altogether separate matter from Che ssed , just as Che ssed is an altogether separate matter from Chochmah , though it is an offshoot from it, for Netzach is not a form of Chessed at all. Nonetheless, when there is a desire to do a Chessed , all obstacles to its fulfillment must be overcome for it to come to its fruiti on. This is a function of Netzach , which is the quality of perseverance , and the overcoming of obstacles. 8 This is an acronym of Binah, Gevurah and Hod . See footnote 1. 9 Proverbs 8:14 10 It is specifically from Binah that the heartfelt quality of being j udgmental branches out . This is because Binah constitutes a close scrutiny and analyses into the finest details of a subject (as discussed in chapter 1). Therefore, it is specifically in Binah , that faults will begin to be noticed, eventually bringing abo ut a judgment to withhold influence ( Gevurah ). (However, although Gevurah is an offshoot of Binah , it is nonetheless an entirely separate matter from it.) 11 Zohar VaYikra 10b, 11a 12 Chochmah is called “Father”, for it is Chochmah which provides the semina l “drop”, the flash of intuition, which is then developed by Binah – “Mother”, into a fully comprehended and developed concept, which then affects and gives “birth” to the arousal of emotions. 13 This is an acronym of Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod , as stated in footnote 1. 14 As mentioned in chapter one, the faculty of Da’at is the intellectual interest, feeling and connection to the subject matter. 15 That is, the thoughts towards any given matter are according to the intellectual connection and feeling towards i t. Moreover, it is the faculty of Da’at which makes the actual intellectual “decision” towards anything. 16 Genesis 8:21 17 Genesis 6:5,6"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"earth] etc.” 18 T here are [many] other cases similar to this, as is explained elsewhere. ) We find that [specifically] in Da’at that the two conceptual opposites of Chessed (Kindness) and Gevurah (Judgme nt) b ecome connected. That is, it may lean toward kindness in on e manner and toward judgment in another manner, and the like, even in [regard to] the same case. Similarly, the attribute of Tiferet mediates between [the heartfelt emotion of] Chessed and [the heartfelt emotion of] Gevurah , 19 An example of this is the [quality of] mercy, which can only take place subsequent to the quality of judgment . [T his is to say that ] although [he is found guilty], mercy releases him. 20 This is the quality of Yaakov , as is known. 21 Likewise, the aspect of Yesod is a mediator which inter -includes the two opposites [gut emotions] of Netzach and Hod . This i s the matter of, “The kidneys which council” [either] yes or no” 22 , before the [actual] influence of the influenc er [is ex pressed ]. [This takes place] whenever it is necessary to express the essential [ heartfelt emotional] qualities of Chessed and Gevurah . For example, in every deliberation of Da’at , [the final decision] comes about through the tipping of the [intellectual] balan ce. Then, after the verdict [has been reached], it is weighed upon “The Righteous S cales”, which are Netzach and Hod , [to determine exactly] how to bring the influence out to the recipient. 23   18 These verses were said by G -d, both as the reason for bringing about the flood which took place during the time of N oah and also the reason for pledging never to destroy the world with a flood again. However, the very same reason is given for both. This difference in decision, even in the same matter, comes about because of the quality of Da’at , which is the intellect ual connection and feeling towards anything. It acts as an intellectual “scale”, so to speak, and can lean either to the right or to the left, for it includes both. 19 See Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, ( Shaar HaMachri’in ) Shaar 9; Chapter 3. 20 Me rcy is a composite of both kindness and severity. It acts as the “scale” for the heartfelt emotions. This is because it is the emotional feeling and connection to something which mediates between either kindness or severity, thus producing a composite em otion. The resulting composite emotion is neither entirely kindness nor is it entirely severity, but is, rather, a median conduct which is a synthesis of the two. 21 See Zohar Lech Lecha 87b. As will be explained later on, Avraham represents the attribute of Chessed (Kindness), Yitzchak represents the attribute of Gevurah (Might), and Yaakov represents the synthesis of the two, which is the quality of Tiferet (Beau ty). 22 The sefirot of Netzach and Hod are the gut emotions and correspond to the Kidneys. Ma ny times the sefirot are allegorically referred to by various organs in the human anatomy to which they correspond. This will be explained later in great detail, in the explanation of the “vessels”. 23 The concept of the three lower sefirot of Netzach (Con quest) , Hod (Majesty) and Yesod (Foundation) is the matter of how the influence will be expressed to the recipient. As mentioned above, Netzach (Conquest) is an offshoot of Chessed (Kindness), while Hod (Majesty) is an offshoot of Gevurah (Might). The ex planation of the difference between these two, and how they are synthesized and inter -included in the aspect of Yesod – Foundation, can be understood by the following example. When a parent wants to influence his child in a way of Netzach , he explains to him why he should think or act in a certain way until he has “won him over” to his way of thinking or acting. This is the aspect of Netzach (Co nquest), where he brings out influence to “win over” the opposition etc. In contrast, the word Hod also mean , “submission”, as in the word “ Hoda’ah ”. Therefo re, in the parent/child relationship, when the parent demands that the child should act or desist from acting in a certain way, not because he has “won him over” to his way of thinking, as with Netzach , but by force of authority alone , this is an influence of Hod . This is when he says to the child, “You must do it because I say so. I don’t owe you explanations.” In the case of a citizen of a country, this is the fact that a person must submit to the laws of the land, whether he agrees with them or not. When he is stopped for a traffic violation, for instance, he cannot argue the merits or demerits of the law with the police officer. He must submit, and if he does not, he will be arrested and restrained. This is to say that the quality of Gevurah necessitates the submission to authority of Hod in order to bring about the actualization of Gevurah. Now, Yesod represents the “scales” of the gut emotions which determines how"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" This , then , is the general matter of the middle line of D aTi”Y, 24 which connects the two lines [to its] right and [to its] left. [Now,] as is known, the particulars of how [the sefirot ] are inter - included are called 25 “The Twelve Diagonal Lines – Yood Beit G’voolei Alachson ” 26 , whereas the middle line is called 27 “The Inner Beam”, for it runs through from one end [to the other]. 28 In other words, it reaches up to the internal aspect of Keter , which itself is higher than the       the actual issuance of influence from the influencer to the recipient should come out . That is, should the influence be in a way of Netzach, should it be in a way of Hod, or should it be a synthesis of both. 24 This is an acronym for Da’at, Tiferet, Yesod , as stated in footnote 1. 25 See Sefer Yet zirah , Chapter 5, Mishna 1. 26 In the configuration of the sefirot of Tikun there are three horizontal pipes, seven vertical pipes and twelve diagonal pipes. These pipes represent how the sefirot interconnect and influence each other. They correspond to the twenty -two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The three horizontal lines correspond to the letters Aleph, Mem and Shin. These are called the three mothers and represent the connections between Chochmah and Binah , which are intellectual sefirot , the connectio n between Chesed and Gevurah which are heartfelt emotional sefirot, and the connections between Netzach and Hod which are gut emotional sefirot . The seven vertical pipes correspond to the seven letters of the Hebrew alphabet which may be pronounced either hard or soft. They represent how influence is drawn down through the three modes of conduct, Chessed, Din, Rachamim - Kindness, Judgment and Mercy. There are vertical two pipes on the right side which represent the mode of Kindness. The upper pipe connects Chochmah - Insight to Chessed - Kindness. The lower pipe connects Chessed - Kindness to Netzach - Victory. There are also two vertical pipes on the left side which represent the mode of Judgment. The upper pipe connects Binah - Comprehension to Gevurah - Sternness. The lower pipe connects Gevurah - Sternness to Hod -Authority. There are four pipes in the middle pipe which represent the mode of Mercy. The highest pipe connects Keter -Desire to Da’at - Interest. The next pipe connects Da’at - Interest to Tiferet - Mercy. The next p ipe connects Tiferet - Mercy to Yesod - foundation. The lowest pipe connects Yesod - Foundation to Malchut -Kingship. The twelve diagonal pipes correspond to the twelve simple letters of the Hebrew alphabet and represent how the middle pipe connects the two oppos ing sides to its right and to its left. The diagonal lines, in a descending order, beginning with the uppermost ones are as follows. The first pipe connects Keter - Desire to Chochmah - Insight. The second pipe connects Keter - Desire to Binah - Comprehension. The third pipe connects Chochmah - Insight to Da’at - Interest. The fourth pipe connects Binah - Comprehension to Da’at - Interest. The fifth pipe connects Da’at - Interest to Chessed - Kindness. The sixth pipe connect Da’at - Interest to Gevurah - Sternness. The seventh pip e connects Chessed - Kindness to Tiferet - Mercy. The eighth pipe connects Gevurah - Sternness to Tiferet - Mercy. The ninth pipe connects Tiferet - Mercy to Netzach - Victory. The tenth pipe connects Tiferet - Mercy to Hod - Authority. The eleventh pipe connects Netzach - Victory to Yesod - Foundation. The twelfth pipe connects Hod -Authority to Yesod - Foundation.

Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, in his monumental book Pardes Rimmonim, Gives a different order of connections, according to a more general overview. For a clearer understanding of all the above, see Appendix One to Chapter 21. 27 See Zohar Terumah 175b. 28 The “Inner Beam” is called the “ Breeyach HaTichon ”. This refers to construction the Tabernacle ( Mishkan ) which was portable Temple used by the Jewish People during the forty year sojourn in the desert until the building of Mishkan Shiloh. Its walls were constructed of cedar beams which stood side by side and were held together by a long beam, the “ Breeyach HaTichon – Inner Beam” which ran within all the beams, connecting them together. Everything in the construction of the Tabernacle (and the Holy Temple in Jerusalem) corresponded to something in the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ). This inner beam corresponds to the middle line of Keter ( Da’at ), Tiferet, Yesod and Malchut which connects all the other sefirot together."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"division into lines. 29 It is for this reason that [the middle line] possesses the power to un ify and synthesize the two [opposite] lines [to its right and left] . 30 Now [for] the explanation of the matter of the inner Keter of the Emanated ( Atzilut ), which is called Keter of Keter, (and is the aspect of Keter of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin etc 31 ).

[However] t he aspect of Chochmah of Keter is the reasoning for the desire, and is called “Th e Hidden Reason of the D esire” 34 . Similarly, [ Keter ] contains a Chessed and a Netzach [etc] , until the aspect of Malchut of Keter . 35 All this is within the aspect of desire, which is [still] unlimited, 36 even though it becomes   29 The middle line of sefirot ( Keter (or Da’at ), Tiferet, Yesod and Malchut ) is different than all of the other int erconnected lines in that it goes from one end to the other without any diminishment whatsoever (as will be explained later at great length). This middle line “runs through”, directly from the internal aspect of Keter , until the final end action of the ac tual influence of Malchut . Moreover, all the sefirot of the middle line actually represent the same aspect, that of a “connection” between the influencer and recipient. Keter represents the connection of the desire to the object of the desire, Da’at is t he intellectual connection of the mind, Tiferet is the heartfelt connection, and Yesod is the actual or gut connection between the influencer and the recipient. Furthermore, all the sefirot of the middle line are literally bound up with each other, as a single entity. For example, regarding the physical connection between Adam and Chava it states, “And Adam knew ( Yada ) Eve”. This knowledge ( Da’at ) does not merely refer to an intellectual connection, for the verse tells us that through this “knowledge” th ey gave birth to a child. Rather, the Zohar states that the sefirah of Yesod corresponds to the male reproductive organ, (whereas Malchut corresponds to the female recipient of the seminal drop of life force). The Talmud states, “A man is incapable of ha ving an erection without Da’at (i.e. without mental interest and focus”). Rather, the verse mentioned above about Adam and Chava teaches us that the sefirot of the middle line are literally bound up with each other, as one. This is to say that the erectio n ( Yesod ) occurs simultaneous to the arousal of desire ( Keter ), the mental interest and focus ( Da’at ) and the heartfelt emotional connection ( Tiferet ). They act, literally, as one. This will be explained in greater detail in chapter 35. 30 This is to say th at because in the inner aspect of Keter (Desire) the sefirot are bound up as a singular essence which is altogether above division into three lines, Keter (Desire) therefore, has the power to inter - include the sefirot one with the other. This is because i n the inner aspect of Keter , they are not opposites at all. (As will now be explained, it is only beginning with the external aspect of Keter (i.e. Chochmah of Keter ) that the sefirot begin to divide into the three lines of Chessed (Kindness), Gevurah (Ju dgment), and the median conduct of Tiferet (Mercy). 31 As mentioned previously, Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin are the two aspects of Keter, and correspond to pleasure and desire, respectively. These two aspects will be explained in great detail in chapters 23 and 24. 32 As opposed to the concealed desire of Adam Kadmon which was previously explained. On the other hand, in comparison to Adam Kadmon, Keter of Atzilut is the revealed desire for the external object of desire and pleasure. 33 As mentioned previously, Keter , i.e. the pleasure and desire in something, is referred to as the “Light” which “enlivens” and “motivates” all the other sefirot . Similarly, Keter of Keter is the light of Keter which “enliven” and “motivates” all the other sefirot of Keter itself, such as Chochmah of Keter, Binah of Keter etc. 34 In the original Hebrew this is called, “ Ta’am HaKamoos LaRatzon”. 35 Since the general sefirah here is Keter – Desire, all of its sub - sefirot are also sefirot of the Desire. Therefore, Chochmah of Keter doe s not refer to actual intellect (which will be explained later). Rather, it refers to the Insight of the Desire. This principle is true of all the other sefirot of Keter as well. For example, Chessed of Keter does not refer to the actual emotional qualit y of Kindness, but rather, to kindness as it exists within the Desire. 36 All the sefirot of the desire are still unlimited, since they have not yet come within the constraints of rational intellect. (For example, a person’s desire for money and wealth is infinite. It is only in the intellect that it takes on the constraints of being reasonable in his expectations.) It is for this reason that the desire"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"reve aled from the “Hidden Ess ential D esire ” [of Adam Kadmon ], as previously explained. It is for this reason that the emotional [ sefirot ] of the desire and pleasure (i.e. Keter itself ) are called “the days of old” 37 in comparison to the emotional [ sefirot ] of [the levels of] Chochmah (Insight) and Binah (Comprehension) [themselves], which come about in a limited fashion , [that is], only acc ording to the limitations of revealed intellect, as will be explained. It is [only] from the external aspect of Keter that there comes about a divi sion into three lines. This is because in the “Hidden Reason for the D esire” , the desire is [already] regarded as being divided into Chessed , Gevurah and the intermediary [quality of Tiferet ]. 38 However, in Keter of Keter , which is beyond the “Hidden R eas on for the D esire”, it is still only a simple essential desire, altogether beyond 39 reason . This is because a desire is altogether beyond reason, even a hidden reason. 40 This is similar to the matter of, 41 “Be silent! Thus it arose in thought etc” , as is e xplained elsewhere. 42 Therefore, although [this level of Keter of Keter ]       ( Keter ) is referred to as “ Arich Anpin – the Long Face”, in contrast to the emotions which follow the int ellect, which are referred to as “ Zeir Anpin – the small Face”. 37 This may also be translated as “The preceding days”. In general, the seven emotional sefirot ( Chessed though Malchut ) correspond to the seven days of the week. Therefore, “The preceding d ays” refers to the “days” (the emotional sefirot ) which “precede” and are beyond the limitations of the intellect. This refers to the emotional sefirot of the desire before they become limited within the bounds of the intellect. 38 This refers to Chochmah of Keter , which is external relative to Keter of Keter . As will be explained in chapter 24, Chochmah of Keter (Insight of Desire) is the desire which comes about according to the dictates of the intellect that something should be in a specific manner, as opposed to any other manner. This is in contrast to Keter of Keter, which is the simple essential pleasure and desire. Because Chochmah of Keter (Insight of Desire) is a desire which is compelled because of the hidden reasoning of the intellect, it is ev ident that here there is a division of three lines. In other words, there is an aspect of something which he takes pleasure in and desires, there is an aspect of something which pains him and which he does not desire, and there is the aspect of a compromi se between the two extremes. 39 The original text is “no reason”. However, here it means that it is super -rational rather than sub -rational. 40 This is to say that the internal aspect of Keter (which is Keter of Keter ) is the simple essential desire for some thing, which is not according to any intellect or reasoning, or even a hidden reasoning, whatsoever. This is like the aforementioned aspect of the essential desires of Tohu . For example, the simple essential desire for kindness does not differentiate be tween one who is worthy of kindness and one who is not. There is not yet any division into three lines, but there is only a simple essential undivided “point” of desire. 41 See Menachot 29b. 42 When Moshe was receiving the Torah on Mt. Sinai, he could not u nderstand the meaning of the crownlets on top of the letters of the Torah. When he asked if there will ever be a person who could understand them, he was shown a vision of Rabbi Akiva expounding mounds and mounds of Halachot – Jewish Laws, from the crownl ets of the Torah etc. Moshe asked what the reward of such a great sage would be. He was then shown a vision of Rabbi Akiva’s brutal death at the hands of the Romans who flayed off his skin. He then asked, “Is this the Torah, and is this its reward?” He was answered by G -d, “ Shtok, Kach Alla BaMachshava - Quiet! Thus it arose in thought.” This is to say that this was G - d’s essential desire which is above and beyond reason. However, it must be understood that, as Rabbi Akiva stated himself, his own perso nal essential desire was to have the opportunity give up his life, with total self - sacrifice, for the sake of sanctifying G - d’s name. This, then, was actually his reward. Moreover, the above statement by G - d, “ Shtok kach alla BaMachshava” also translates as, “Quiet, Thus he arose in thought.” This may be understood to be an answer to Moshe’s question. That is, through the self sacrifice of Rabbi Akiva, in his service of G -d, in which he gave himself over totally to G - d’s will, literally to the point of dea th, he “arose” to the level of G - d’s essential desire. Later, in chapter 40, on the statement of the Zohar, “ Eet machshava v’eet machshavah – There is thought and there is thought ” the Rebbe explains that there are two levels of thought - machshava, one of w hich actually is desire. This is because a “desire” becomes"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"com es into revelation from the lowest aspect of the concealed desire of the aspect of Adam Kadmon , (as explained at the end of chapter 19), it is [nonetheless] above divisions of righ t and left. 43 About this it states, 44 “And the curtain shall be for you as a separation between the holy and the holy of holies”. [This refers to] the aspect of the space ( Parsa ) seperating Keter of Keter from Chochmah [of Keter ]. 45 This is the aspect of t he Krooma D’Aveera 46 (“ Airy Membrane”), as explained elsewhere at length. For this reason we say [in our prayers 47 ], “May it be desirable before you”, [that is,] before the Parsa – Space. [Since it is above division , it can therefore ] change from a desire of judgment to a desire of kindness, and the like. 48 This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Twenty One       immediately enclothed within thought, as mentioned previously. The thought spoken of here, in the case of Rabbi Akiva, is referring to this level of thought which is beyond reason and is actually a desire. 43 One may think that since Keter of Keter of Atzilut only comes out of the external “letters” of Malchut of Adam Kadmon, it is no longer a simple essential light, but is, rather, already defined. Here, the Rebbe informs us that this is not t he case. This is because although the “letters” of Malchut of Adam Kadmon is a limited definition of “self - perception” and “desire for desire” relative to the Primal Desire ( Ratzon HaKadoom ), nonetheless, it still is unlimited. For example, the concealed n ature of a person to desire a dwelling place, is still completely unlimited, and is not yet defined to any specific type of shelter. When this desire becomes revealed as Keter of Atzilut , as a desire for a house, although in a sense, it is limited to bein g the desire for a house, nonetheless it is still entirely unlimited. This is because, as mentioned above in note 36, in the essential desire of Keter of Keter , the desire for the house is a desire for an infinite house, with infinite rooms etc. Moreover, in the essential desire of Keter of Keter , there is not yet any compromise or composite desire. It is only when the desire descends from Keter of Keter to Chochmah of Keter (the intellect of the desire) that there is a division of three lines according to the “hidden reasoning”, and there can, therefore , be compromise. 44 Parshat Terumah , 26:33 45 The word Parsa mean s a space or separation , as in the verse, “ Kol maphreset parsa - Every [animal] that has separated hooves etc” (Leviticus 11:3) . That is to say, there is a jump ( a Dilug ) and gap of a “ Parsa - seperation ” between the essential desire of Keter of Keter ( Tohu ) and the composite desire of Chochmah of Keter ( Tikkun ), f or, as previously mentioned, there is no reason at all for a desire . There is , theref ore , a “gap” between Keter of Keter (the simple point of the desire), and Chochmah of Keter (the desire to rationalize the des ire, or a desire which is compelled by intellect etc). 46 See Zohar ( Idra Rabba ) Naso 128b. The skull ( Galg ulta ) corresponds to Ke ter (desire), while the brain ( Mocha ) corresponds to the intellect, namely, Chochmah (insight). Just as above, there is a “space” between Keter and Chochmah , so too, there is an airy membrane ( Krooma D’Aveera ) which exists between the physical skull ( Kete r ) and the brain ( Chochmah ). (Many times throughout Kabbalah and Chassidut, certain aspects of the sefirot are referred to by their physical counterparts in man. As is known, man is called an “ Olam Katan – A little worl d”, in that he is a microcosm that corresponds to the entire chaining down of the worlds. Everything found below in man is an indication of how it is in the Seder Hishtalshelut - The chaining down of the worlds .) 47 See the morning blessings and other places. 48 As will be explained later , th e source of the Torah and all its specific commandments is from the aspect of Chochmah of Keter (Insight of Desire) . We therefore appeal to G - d and say, “Although according to the dictates of Your Divine wisdom and intellect (the Torah) we have transgress ed your commandments ( Mitzvot ) and are, therefore, guilty and worthy of punishment , nonetheless, may it be that Your essential desire ( Keter of Keter ) of love and kindness be revealed, thus superceding Chochmah of Keter , and may You deal with us kindly, beyond the letter of the law, i.e. from beyond the Parsa .”"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Appendix to Chapter Twenty One The Inter -inclusions of the Twelve Diagonal Lines In the diagram below, two of the horizontal lines which were mentioned in our chapter are missing, between Chochmah and Binah , and between Gedulah ( Chessed ) and Gevurah . The Twelve Diagonal Lines according to the RaMaK Also, we notice that the RaMaK makes diagonal lines, i.e. inter -inclusion, between Chochmah and Gevurah and Binah and Chessed , not by way of the middle line, but directly. The reason for this is because he does not include the Sefirah of Da’at . Therefore, although the above depiction is correct, it is only correct in a general fashion . Later in Shaar HaYichud (as well as in many other places in Kabbalah and Chassidut ) it is explained that the intellect ual sefirot divide into three, i.e. Chochmah , Binah and Da’at . However, it is explained that the sefirah of Da’at splits up into two, Chessed and Gevurah . Therefore, as will later be explained, the “brain” (i.e. the intellectual sefirot ) has four main ch ambers. These are Chochmah , Binah , Chessed of Da’at and Gevurah of Da’at . Therefore, a depiction of the twelve diagonal lines in a more particular manner , which would includ e Da’at , is as follows: The Twelve Diagonal Lines i Here, the sefirah of Da’at is included , and all inter -inclusions of the right and left lines are by way of the middle line, as explained in our chapter. In truth, these two diagrams are not in conflict, except that one is more general and one is more particular. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"This diagram is i n accordance with what is explained in Shaar HaYichud, that all the inter -inclusions are specifically by way of the middle line of Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod . Clearly, the Mittler Rebbe does indeed count Da’at . The inter -inclusions of the sefirot may also b e understood in a three dimensional manner: When one is standing in a square room, there are six directions (i.e. right, left, front and back, up and down ). The re are twelve edges interconn ect ing one wall with the other . The six directions and the ce nter of the room correspond to the seven emotional sefirot as follows: Chessed – Right Gevurah – Left Tiferet – Front Netzach – Up Hod – Down Malchut – Back Yesod – Center The twelve edges represent the particular inter -incl usions between all of the abo ve, thus connecting all the walls, and forming a three dimensional space. The reason that they are called “diagonal lines” is because all of these edges a re at a diagonal from one who stands in the center. (See Imrei Binah 3, 3.) The reason for this expl anation is that it is only in Tikkun , in which there is an inter - inclusion of all the sefirot , that dimensions are possible. In Tohu , the sefirot do not become inter -includ ed, but rather, are dimensionless essential points. Now, it must be understood tha t all the above diagrams and explanations are only meant to be aids to remember all the particular inter -inclusions of the sefirot . However, the essential concep t of the inter - inclusions of the sefirot of Yosher ( Tikkun ) must be understood according to th e explanation of Shaar HaYichud itself. That is, in Tikkun the sefirot are no longer simple essential points of desire, but are now composites of all the various qualities together. For example, the diagonal lines between Kete r, Chochmah and Binah indica te the possib ility of a composite between desire and intellect. In other words, it is possible for there to be a n inter -inclusion and composi te between desire and intellect , so that t here could be a desire which is tempered by intellect or intellect tempe red by desire. This i s likewise the case with all other inter -inclusions of the sefirot , which may be understood through all the qualities in man, and their compositions. They no longer are in their essential stat es, but are composites which divide and inter -include each other, as will be explained further in following chapters.   i The significance of the various letters on this diagram of the ten sefirot is as follows: Sefer Yetzirah categorizes the letters of the Hebrew alphabet into three categories. The first category is comprised of the letters Aleph ( א ) Mem ( מ ) and Shin ( ש ). These are called \"The three Mothers\" and represent the horizontal lines connecting the Sefirot.

Though Rai sh ( ר ) is not written with a Dagesh , it is nonetheless pronounced hard or soft, and although Gimmel ( ג ) and Dalet ( ד ) may posses a Dagesh , their proper pronunciation has been lost.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Two We must now understand the particular inter -inclusions of the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut (Emanation). However, we must first explain the specifics of the matter of the sub - division of the sefirot into ten, and ten into ten etc. For example, Chessed of Chochmah (Kindness of Inisight ) also divides into ten, and likewis e, Gevurah of Chochmah (Sternness of Insight) divides into ten etc . For, [as is known], Chochmah (Insight) includes ten [ sefirot ] in it. An example is Chessed and Gevurah of Chochmah (Kindness and Sternness of Insight) , which are the [intellectual] leanin gs, either towards merit or towards judgment. Now, Chessed of Chochmah , which is the intellectual leaning towards merit, also includes ten [ sefirot ] within it . This is like Chessed and Gevurah as they are within [ Chessed of Chochmah , so that there is an intellectual] leaning toward merit i n a specific manner, and also an [intellectual] imperative toward judgment in a specific manner. 1 (For, although merit will be overturned to culpability within [the quality of] Judgment of Chochmah , and culpability will be over turned to merit with in Kindness of Chochmah , this is [onl y so ] as the quality is in its essence, [wherein] there are no sub -divisions. 2 However, [as it is in a state of] sub -division s, [of the ten sub -dividing into ten etc .], it is possible for th e aspect of Judgment to even be with in Kindness of Insight ( Chessed of Chochmah ), and for the aspect of Kindness to be within the Judgement of In sight ( Din of Chochmah ), as is known. 3 )   1 This is to say that the intellect which leans towards kindnes s does not lean towards absolute kindness, but is also a composite of the ten sefirot . Therefore, although it generally leans towards kindness, nonetheless, it is not the pure essential quality of kindness, but is, rather, a “diluted” kindness which is te mpered by Gevurah of Chessed of Chochmah , which itself leans towards judgment. 2 As explained previously, regarding the essential points of the sefirot of Tohu (i.e. the expressions of the essential desires), although they have ten sefirot included in the m, nonetheless, these sefirot are not at all recognizable in them. This is because they all are “bound - up” ( Akudim ) within a single sefirah , and are, therefore, “bribed” or “enslaved” to that sefirah . Therefore, although the essential point of Chessed includes Gevurah in it, nonetheless, its Gevurah is not at all a true Gevurah , since it is totally “enslaved” to the essential Chessed. This is so much so, that it is as if it does not actually exist. Therefore, within the essential sefirah of Chessed of To hu, judgments are “overturned” to kindnesses. However, this does not represent true inter - inclusion at all. For example, one who’s essential desire for kindness is in a revealed state, will perceive everything in kind terms, while one who’s essential des ire for judgment is revealed will perceive everything judgmentally. Two such individuals will be completely incompatible with each other. They will be incapable of tolerating each other, i.e. there can be no compromise or cooperation between them. This i s because their qualities are essential qualities that do not subdivide. 3 In Tikkun, where the sefirot extend outside of their essential qualities, and become “objective”, rather than the “subjective” way that they are in Tohu, they subdivide into ten, a nd those into ten etc. In such a case, the aspect of Gevurah of Chessed (Sterness of Kindness) is an actual judgment, rather than a kindness."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" Similarly, the [actual ] emotional [ sefirot ] of Chessed and Gevurah the mselves are also divided into the ten [ sefirot ], Keter, Chochmah, Binah , and the Midot 4 etc. For, although [it was state d 5 ], “We do not [exercise] mercifulness during judgm ent”, this was [said was in regard to ] the essential Judgment. 6 Similarly, there i s no Judgment in the essential [attribute] of Kindness. However, as they spread forth from the essence [to become composites] , there is Kindness in Judgment and Judgment in Kindness, as mentioned above. 7 Now, there is a [type of] inter -inclusion called, “T he nullification of a thing to its opposite, which opposes it”, in which it becomes just like its opposite. This is like the [concept of the] “sweetening” of the Judgments ( Gevurot ) with in Kindnesses ( Chassadim ). 8 For example, this is like when the pro secutor transforms to be come a defender, or the oppos ite, when the defender transforms to be come a prosecutor. 9 Similarly , it is like the sweetening of bitter waters in sweet [waters], or the opposite. 10 Likewise, [it is like] the nullification of an inte llectual [reasoning] for merit into an intellectual [reasoning] for culpability, or the like. These are [all examples of] true inter -inclusion , which is only possible because the opposition itself [latently] possesses its [opposite] power. If this was no t the case, it would be impossible for it to become nullified to it. 11 For exam ple, sweetness possesses a [latent]       Likewise, the aspect of Chessed of Gevurah (Kindness of Sternness) is an actual kindness, rather than a judgment . Because of this, it has the ability to counterbalance and temper its opposite quality, thus producing a composite quality, which is made up of a compromise between the two. This is possible due to the three lines of Tikkun , wherein the general sefirot subdivide into more and more specific particulars and yet retain their identities. 4 Midot means “the emotions”, and refers to the six emotional sefirot (and sometimes Malchut as well). 5 See Tractate Ketubot 84a. 6 The simple meaning of this statement is that a judge is not allowed to bend his decision out of mercy for one of the legal parties. However, here the Rebbe explains this on a deeper level as meaning that there is no mercy within the essential attribute of judgment, and, likewise, there is no j udgment in the essential attribute of kindness or mercy etc. 7 This was explained in chapters 20 and 21, and in footnotes 2 and 3 of this chapter. 8 In Kabbalah and Chassidut this is called, “ Meetook HaGevoorot BaChassadim – The Sweetening of the Judgment s within the Kindnesses”. This will now be explained. 9 This analogy is to be understood as follows: It is like when a defending attorney presents such a strong case that the prosecuting attorney must admit to the innocence of the defendant , or visa vers a. That is, he becomes “sublimated” to the stronger arguments of the defense. This is simi lar to the analogy several sentences later in which the intellectual reasoning for culpability b ecomes sublimated and acknowledges the intellectual reasoning for me rit, or vice versa. 10 For example, cocoa is one of the most bitter substances in the world . However, when mixed with a proper proportion of sugar, it produces chocolate, which is a composite taste and is one of the most delightful and popular confections in the world. This admixture is only possible in our physical world of Tikkun, because cocoa latently possesses a concealed quality of s weetness and sugar latently possesses a concealed quality of b itterness . If this were not the case, the two flavors w ould clash, even when mix ed. The essential quality of bitterness and the essential quality of sweetness , as they exist in Tohu, are t wo opposites which are incompatible with each other and cannot coexist. (As mentioned previously regarding the “Kings of Tohu ”, one must “die” before the next can “reign”.) 11 I other words, it is impossible for a person whose essential desire for kindness is in a revealed state to view any thing from a different perspective. I t is certainly impossible for him to agree with a differing view. Moreover, as previously explained, his intellectual reasoning is n ot true intellect, but is actually merely enslaved to his desire for kindness. Therefore, under no circumstances will he be able perceive things in a different light, or ag ree to an opposite vi ew. This is because the vantage point of the “points” of desire of Tohu are totally subjective . However, being that Tikkun is objective, the aspect of kindness is not an essential absolute kindness, but rather, also contains judgment , and is tem pered by it. Although"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"bitterness and bitterness possesses a [latent] sweetness. 12 By way of an alogy, an example of this is a [dish called] Merkachat , [whic h is mad e] from honey cooked with radishes. This creates a delightful taste, which includes s harpness and sweetness together as one , as is known. 13 Similarly, there is [something of ] the nature of fire in water, and [something of the ] nature of water in fire. 14 B ecause of this , there can be an inter -inclusion of fire with water, or water with fire, as stated 15 , “He took water from fire and fire from water etc”. This [principle] likewise [applies to] the emotions of Chessed (Kindness) and Gevurah (Judgment). Beca use there is Judgment in Kindness and Kindness in Judgment, as mentione d above, therefore, Judgment may be nullified with in Kindness, or visa versa , Kindne ss [may be nullified] with in Judg ment. If this were not so, there c ould never be an inter -inclusion of one thing with its opposite. 16 However, there is [another type of] inter -inclusion of Judgment with Kindness [which comes about specifically ] because it is essentially similar to it , rather than being negated by it . On the contrary, [in such a case] , it [actually] gives [additional] strength and force [to its opposite] . N onetheless , it is called Gevurah of Chessed (Sternness of Kindness) or the reverse, Chessed of Gevurah (Kindness of Judgment) in that it strength ens the sternness and judgment. 17       kindness is the dominant revealed characteristic, it nonetheless possesses judgment as well , as a recessive characteristic . Therefore, it is possible for it to compromise and become inter -include d with judgment and even become s ublimated to judgment under some circumstance s, similar to the examples above, in which the judgment is stronger than the kindness, and therefore causes the kindness to lean towards judgment. 12 See footnote 10. 13 This is the chief principle of the Chinese culinary arts and cooking in general. The delightful taste of the food is dependent on the proper proportions and compos itions of opposite flavors, such as “sweet & sour” etc. 14 As previously mentioned our physical world (and all the worlds above i t until the world of Tohu which precedes Atzilut ) is a composite world of Tikkun – Rectification. Therefore, even the quality of fire latently possesses its opposite, which is the quality of water, and vice versa. If this were not the ca se, they could not co -exist in the world. (F or example the essential quality of fire as it is in Tohu, is infinitely hot. However, the composite quality of fire as it is in Tikkun, may run the gamut of the varying temperatures between infinite heat and infinite cold . Lik ewise, the essential quality of water as it is in Tohu, is infinitely cold. However, the composite quality of water as it is in Tikkun, may, likewise, run the gamut of the varying temperatures between infinite cold and infinite heat etc. This is because o f the sub -divisions and inter -inclusions of fire and water, wherein each lat ently possesses something of its opposite .) 15 This is brought down in various places in the name of Sefer Yetzirah . 16 That is, if Chessed and Gevurah did not latently possess somet hing of each other , there could never be tolerance or compromise between the two. An ex ample of this is when one side of an argument bends to the other side of the argument. This is because he can relate and see the view of the opposing side, since he lat ently possesses this quality as well. It is only because of this that compromise is possible. In contrast, in the essential qualities of Tohu – Chaos, the essential quality of Chessed can in no way relate to the essential quality of Gevurah. Compromise i s therefore impossible. 17 In the previous type of inter -inclusion, o ne power becomes sublimated to the opposing power and weakened by it. This produces an intermediary median quality which po ssesses a measure of both, in which one dominates and the other is sublimated to it . For example, in the example of the arg umentative conflict above, in which one side acknowledges the other. This is because his ar gument is weaker than the other argument. His argument is therefore “nullified” by it, and he submits to it. However, it is a reluctant submission. He would have preferred for his arguments to have dominated. In this type of inter -inclusion, it is even possible that they both become weakened by the other, thus producing a compromise which is a composite of the two . For example, when one takes bitter lemon juice and mixes it with sweet water, they"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" As is known, t his matter is comparable to [the verse 18 ], “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; [and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.] For [in doing so] you shall heap coals [of fire upon his head etc ] ”. This is to say that with this kindnes s and goodness , he perpetrates complete malevolence and judgment upon hi s [enemy] , by destroying his soul . 19 Similarly, [it states , 20 ] “He (G - d) pays His enemies up front, in order to destroy them”. 21 This is likewise the case in any a spect of judgment and retribution which is done throught the aspect of kindness. This [kindness] gives much greater strength and force to the judgment, and is called Chessed of Gevurah (Kindness of Judgment). This is like [the verse, 22 ] “And G -d shall cause His glorious voice to b e heard” in the camp of Sancheri v. 23 Similarly, the opposite is true of the aspect of Gevurah of Chessed (Sternness of Kindness). [That is,] there will be a much greater strength and force in an act of ki ndness which is perpetrated through the quality of judgment. An example of this is the Gevurot G’shamim - “The strength of the rains” , 24 which comes in a constricted fashion. This is in order that they should come forth with abundance. 25 This is similar to the Tzimtzum - constriction of any light of infl uence, so that it may be received by the recipient. 26 This [principle] also applies to the d ivisions of the “72 bridges” 27 and like wise to the “af flictions of love”, [as stated, 28       both become weakened to produce lemonade, which is a composite of both. Depending upon the proportions of the composition , either the bitterness will dominate ove r sweetness or the sweetness will dominate over the bitterness. Nonetheless, they are both weakened. However, in this second type of inter - inclusion, this is not at all the case . In the second type of composition, the “opposite” actually gives greater st rength to its opposing power, as will now be explained. 18 Proverbs 25:21,22 19 One of the most shameful things, if not the most shameful thing is being the recipient of charity , because the recipient feels that he has not earned it. Certainly, the shame is all that much greater when a person must receive charity from his e nemy. Therefore, although, in action , the giver is doing a n act of kindness , in truth, this kindness is a very harsh sternness, because it brings great shame upon the recipient and litera lly destroys his very soul . 20 According to V’Etchanan 7:10 21 Even wicked people pos sess some good deeds. For the little good they possess, G -d pays them their reward up front, in this world, so that He can destroy them later, in the world to come . Theref ore, although the action comes in a way of kindness, in actuality it is the strongest form of judgment. 22 Isaiah 30:31,32 23 Although usually a revelation of G - d and “the glory of His voice” would be considered a great kindness and revelation, this prophecy speaks of the destruction of the Assyrians (Sancherev was the king of Assyria), who , because of their wickedness, could not withstanding this revelation. Therefore, in this case, this expression of k indness and revelation is actually a matter of judgment and destruction. 24 See Mishnah at the beginning of Tractate Ta’anit . 25 That is, the rains come with strength in small constricted drops which is a function of Gevurah . Nonetheless, rain itself is a kindness. However, were the entire body of rains (i.e. k indness) to come down without any “constriction” into drops and without being spread th roughout the year, they would cause tremendous flood ing , which would be the opposite of kindness. 26 For example, when a teacher limits his explanations to the capacity o f the student, this is a great Tzimtzum - lessening and an act of Gevurah – Sternness . However, although it appears to be a limitation and an act of Gevurah , in truth it is an act of Chessed – Kin dness, so that the light and influence of the teaching may be within the capacity of the recipient to receive. (This was previously explained in regard to the Tzimtzum of the Infinite Light.) 27 See Pardes Rimonim , Shaar 21 ( Shaar Pratey HaShemot ), Chapter 5. Rabbi Nechunia Ben HaKanah ( Sefer HaBahir ) calls G - d’s n ame of 72 by the term “the 72 Bridges”. The name of 72 spoken of here does not refer to the name of 72 mentioned earlier, which is an expansion of the tetragramaton and has the numercal value of seventy two . Rather, it refers to the name which is made up of the thr ee verses that"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"“For the L -rd reproves him whom he loves,] even as a father [disciplines 29 ] the son, in whom he delights”. That is, the kindness is specifically actualized through a garment of the quality of judgment . It is specifically this [type of expression of kindness] which [brings out] the [strength and] force of the kindness, even more tha n the [expression of] the essential kindness . 30 This is similar to [the statement, 31 ] “He precedes the cure to the infliction”, and as stated, 32 “For He has torn, and He will heal us; He has smitten, and He will bind us up”. 33 Now, at first glance, why i s th e infliction necessary altogether ? However , through the healing , one becomes healthier and strong er [than at first ]. 34 This is because sickness is the aspect of harsh judgment. It is remedied by means of the quality of the Judgment in the K indness, i.e. medicine, which [made up] from harsh [substances ]. 35 This [principle] applies to the sweetening of every judgment . [It takes place] specifically in its [essential] source. That is , it is specifically [by means] of the Judgment in the Kindness ( Din SheBe Ches sed ). Because it is the strength of the Kindness, [this is what is required] to ove rpower the Judgment and sweet en it. This will suffice for those of understanding. Through all of the above, the inter -inclusions of Chessed and Gevurah , and the particula r way s of how [they inter -include] may be understood, in that even Gevurah of Chessed [may be inter - included] with Chessed of Gevurah . [This holds true] even though they may be two extreme       begin with the words, “ VaYisa, VaYavo, VaYeit ” (Exodus 14:19 -21). It is called the name of 72 because it is made up of 72 three letter combinations, made up of the letters of these three verses. (The first verse is in forward or der, the second in backward order, and the third, again in forward order.) Now this name is a name of Kindness, as indicated by the fact that the numerical value of 72 is Chessed – Kindness ( חסד ). However , it is expressed thro ugh the vehicle and vessels of Gevurah - Sternness , as indicated by the fact that the numerical value of 216 (3x72=216) is Gevurah – Judgment ( גבורה ). As explained above, this type of expression brings out the strength of the kindnesses. 28 Proverbs 3:12 29 The Mittler Rebbe placed this word at the end o f the sentence, after the quote. We have placed it here , although it is not part of the verse, so that it will fit with the sentence. 30 For example, wh en a father sees his child placing himself i n danger, he will discipline the child and rebuke him. Although this is an expression of Gevurah , in truth, it is actually the greatest act of kindness – Chessed . Were he to not to discipline his child and show him his displeasure in this dangerous behavior, the child would continue to endanger h imself, and will end up coming to some harm , G -d forbid. Actually, this is a greater kindness, even than the expression of essential kindness. This is because the expression of essential kindness does not take the external situation into account. Therefo re, an expression of the essential kindness would be if the father would just allow his child to do whatever he wanted, danger or not. Surely, this type of kindness leads to great harm and destruction, as in the above example. Therefore, this inter -inclu sion, in which the kindness is expressed through the quality of Gevurah – Sternness , is actually an even stronger expression of love and kindness than the expression of the essential kindness. 31 See Tractate Megillah 13b. 32 Hoshea 6:1 33 In other words, “H e precedes the cure to the infliction” is an indication that the inner light which precedes the actualization and expression , is that of Chessed – Kindness, while the externa l vehicle and expression of the kindness , is a vessel of its opposite, Gevurah – Sternness . 34 For e xample, when a person exercises his muscles in order to become stronger, what he is actually doing is destroying his muscles. It is for this r eason that his muscles are worn and ache after a good “workout”. However, when they heal they be come much stronger than they previously were. 35 For example, most medicines are actually poisons and their intake must be carefully regulated. Moreover, surgery itself, is an act of Gevurah – Sternness . However, it is an act of Gevurah of Chessed – Stern ness of Kindness, which removes and alleviates actual “Sternness” such as a terrible disease ."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"opposites, [such as in a case] in which one is potent Kindness ( Ch essed ) and one is potent Judgment ( Gevurah ). Moreover, they are certainly [opposites] in that they are expressed within exchanged [and opposing] garments, [in which ] one actualizes a judgment and one actualizes a kindness. Nonetheless, since each one is specifically an actualization for something wh ich is its opposite , i.e. Gevurah of Chessed actualiz es judgment but its inner [motivation ] is kindness, and Chessed of Gevurah actualiz es kindness but its inner [motivation ] is j udgment, therefore, specifically [because of this] they can to come together as one, since each one [includes and] , at the very least , indicates these two opposites. This may be illustrated [by the fact that it was the angel] “Gavriel who [offered to] save Avraham”, 36 and similarly, [by the fact that it was Gavriel ] who 37 “cooled the coals”. 38 This [comes] from the aspect of the Gevurah in the Chessed . S imilar ly, a good [heavy] sweat eliminates the illness of [high] fever, like [ the above mentioned fact that harsh] medications   36 See Tractate Pesachim 118a. When the wicked Nimrod ca st our forefather Avraham into the fiery furnace, the angel Gavriel said before the Holy One blessed be He , “Master of the universe, I will go down and cool the flames, and save the Righteous Tzaddik from the flaming furnace”. The Holy One blessed be He said to him, “I am singular in My world, and he is singula r in his world. It is better that the Singular One saves the singular one ”. However, since the Holy One blessed be He never withhold s the reward of any creature, He said, “You will merit to save three of his descendents”. When the wicked Nebuchadnezzar cast Chana nel, Misha’el and Azariah into the fier y furnace, Yorkemoo, the angel of hail , stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said to Him, “Master of the universe, I will go down and cool the fires and save these Righteous Tzaddikim from the fiery furnace”. Gavriel replied to him, “This does not reveal the migh t of the Holy One blessed is He, for you are the angel of hail, and everyone knows that water puts out fire. Rather, I, the angel of fire, shall go down. I will make it cool on the inside, but burn hot on the outside, thus bringing about a miracle within a miracle.” The Holy One blessed be He sent him (Gavriel) down. From this story we observe that it was specifically the angel of fire who cooled the fires of the furnace. This is possible only because of the inter -inclusions, because the angel of fire possesses something of the angel of water and vice versa. 37 See Tractate Yoma 77a. 38 The Talmud in tractate Yoma 77a discusses a vision of Ezekiel. It states (Ezekiel 8:16), “He brought me to the inner court of the house of HaShem, and beho ld, at the door of the temple of HaShem, between the Ulam (porch) and the Altar there were about twenty five men. Their backs were towards the temple of HaShem, and they faced east, and they bowed down eastward, to the sun.” The Talmud continues, “ From t he fact that it states that they faced east don’t we know that their backs were towards the temple of HaShem? Rat her, what do we learn from the fact that their backs were turned towards the temple of HaShem? This teaches us that they were revealing thems elves, and defecating (towards the Shechinah ). The Holy One blessed be He said to (the angel) Michael, “Michael, your people have sinned”. Michael answered, “Master of the Universe, isn’t it enough that there are good people amongst them?” The Holy One blessed be He answered him, “I will burn them, including the good ones that are amongst them (because they did not rebuked the sinners).” Then (Ezekiel 10:2) “G -d spoke to the man who was clothed in linen (referring to Gavriel) and said, “Go in between the wheels (referring to the Ophanim angels), under the cherub (referring to the Chayot HaKodesh angels), and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw them upon the city”. And he went in, in my (Ezekiel’s) sight.” It then conti nues and says (Ezekiel 10:7) “And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and he took thereof and gave it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen (Gavriel), who took it and went out .” Rav Channa Bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Chasidah, “Had the coals not cooled from the hands of the cherub to the hands of Gavriel, there would not remain even a remnant or a refugee from the enemies of Israel”. (Note: The term “The enemies of Israel” is a euphemism for Israel themselves. The Talmud did not wish to express a curse in regard to the Jweish people so it turned it around against their enemies.) We see from this story that the coals cool ed in the hands of Gavriel, the angel of fire . Now, s eemingly, they should have gotten hotter in his hands. However, because he possesses the quality of Chessed as well, he is actually capable of cooling the coals."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"heal afflic tions. [Furthermore] , it was he [Gavriel ] who smote the camp of Sancheriv, in an aspect of Chessed which is in Gevurah , as stated, 39 “ The angel of the HaShem 40 went out and smote in the camp of Ashur etc”, as is known. 41 This will suffice for those of unde rstanding. This then is [the meaning of the statement, 42 ] “ To include the left in the right and the right in the left”. This is similar to light of Chessed in a vessel of Gevurah , wherein the vessel actualizes the opposite of its light. That is, the vess el of Gevurah actualizes judgment, which is the opposite of the light of kindness which is in it. 43 The reverse is also true. A vessel of Chessed may actualize kindness, which is the opposite of the light of Gevurah which is in it. 44 However, this is not at all a contradict ion, since this [phenomenon] is the aspect of light s and vessel s, 45 which is related to the matter of “form” and “ substance ” (as will be explained later ). 46 This is in accordance to t hat which is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the inter -inclusions of the name of seventy -two and the name of forty -two, which are the [first] two paragraphs of the Shema recital. 47 Another example [of this principle] is [the fact that ] the binding of Y itzchak was [done] by Avraham, the [epitomal] man of kindness. 48 [This is] likewise the case in regard to the “waving” 49 of the Levites, who became included   39 See Tractate Sanhedrin 95b, The Second Book of Kings 19:35 and Isaiah 37:36. 40 Scripture specifically uses the term the Angel of “ HaShem ”. The word HaShem (l iterally, “The Name”) refers to G- d’s four letter proper name Y -H-V-H, which indicates the quality of Chessed. Here, the angel Gavriel, who is generally the angel of fire and st ernness, is referred to as the angel of HaShem, thus associating him with kindness. 41 We learn that this was a kindness of judgment – Chessed of Gevurah from the fact that the angel which smote was called “ Malach HaVayah – The Angel of HaShem”. The name u sed in this verse is the tetragrammaton, which is a name of kindness. That is, this was an expression of the strongest judgments, which is specifically from Chessed (kindness) of Gevurah (judgment), as explained above. 42 See Zohar beginning of Parshat Ko rach. 43 For example, when a father disciplines his child, the external vessel and vehicle of expression is that of Gevurah – Sternness . However, the inner light and motivation for this is a light of love and kindness – Chessed . 44 This is like the aforeme ntioned example where one gives charity to his enemy. This act of kindness is really a v ehicle for the light of sternness which is within it, to cause great shame and anguish to his enemy, destroying his very soul. 45 That is to say, the vessel is only a m eans to an end, and the light is the desire for the end goal. 46 This will be explained later in chapters 27 through 31. 47 See Sefer HaLikutim , Ot Mem, page 5. In short, the first paragraph of the Shema recital has 42 words, beginning with the word “ V’Ahav ta – And you shall love” until the end of the paragraph. This paragraph corresponds to the name of 42. It is explained in the writings of the Arizal that the name of 42 (of Ana B’Koach ) is a name of Sterness - Gevurah . In contrast, the second paragraph of the Shema recital has 72 words, beginning with “ V’Hayah – And it shall come to pass” until the word “ V’Samtem – And you shall place them”. The name of 72 is a name of kindness (as is indicated by its numerical value, which is equal to the word Chessed , a s mentioned previously). Now, the first paragraph speaks of great love for G -d ( Chessed ), while the second paragraph speaks of the retribution which will ensue when one strays from G -d ( Gevurah ). So although the first paragraph represents Gevurah , it is expressed through vessels (i.e. letters) of Chessed . In contrast, the second paragraph represents Chessed , but is expressed through vessels of Gevurah . 48 That is to say, Avraham who was the embodiment of kindness (as it states “ Chessed L’Avraham ”) was cap able of acting with sternness during the binding of Yitzchak etc. This was possible only because he included something of the a spect of sternness within himself. 49 See Numbers 8:5 through 8:21. G -d commanded that the Levites should be inaugurated and con secrated for the service of Priests in the Temple (or Tabernacle) by being offered as “wave offerings” before G -d. They were given as “gifts” by G -d to Aaron and his descendants (the Priests) to serve them in the holy temple. However, it is explained in Kabbalah that the Levites are rooted in the side of Gevurah while the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"with in the Kindnesses of the Priests. 50 This is as stated, 51 “[Bring your brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,] bring them near to you, [so that they may join to you , and minister to you]”. This is why is it possible for them to serve their opposites? There are many other examples of this [as well] . Now, all of this is possible only because of the aspect of the sub -divisio ns which exist in each [ sefirah ]. Therefore, “a kind find s its kind and become awakened”, 52 even when the two are literal ly opposites. This is simila r to the matter of the differences between Michael and Gavriel , the angels of fire and water. [Nonetheles s] t hey do not extinguish each other, as it states 53 , “He makes peace in His high places”. This is specifically because each one [latently] possesses something of its opposite. 54 However, in [regard to] the completely simple [essential] lights, such as the aspect of Nekudot – Points 55 , which are called Ketarim – Crown s, it is impossible for them to become inter - include whatsoever. This is because each one is completely different from the other , and nothing of its opp osite can be found in it altogether . 56 An example [of this] is the essential aspect of good ness which is in the essence of the soul of a good person, and is cal led “T he depth of good ness”. [I n no way can it compromise] with the essential evil, which is called “the depth of evil”. Only in true p enitents – Ba’alei T’shoova, do we find that even the essence of evil has been transformed into good ness, so much so that , 57 “ their transgressions themselves become counted as merits” . This is because they give themselves over with [complete] self -sacrific e to the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), which itself is beyond even the essential differences between Chessed (Kindness) and Gevurah (Judgment). 58 Therefore, it is specifically through giving ourselves over [to G -d] with [complete] se lf-sacrifice , we are capable of pray ing and say ing , “M ay it be desirable”, in [G - d’s] essence , [i.e.] “ before You ” etc. 59 Similarly, [regarding the thirteen attributes of mercy it states, 60 ] “And the HaShem       Priests ( Kohanim ) are rooted on the side of Chessed . The Rebbe then asks, “How is it possible for them to serve their opposites?” The answer is that because each side contains somethin g of its opposite, and is not a simple absolute essence, but rather a composite, therefore, they can inter -include with each other, and do not negate each other. 50 It is explained that the Levites are rooted on the side of Gevurah, while the Priests ( Kohan im ) are rooted on the side of Chessed . 51 Numbers 18:3 52 See Tractate Eruvin 9a. 53 Job 25:2 54 This latent commonality allows for inter -inclusio n and relationship between the opposites. 55 This refers to the essential desires of Tohu which were previously exp lained. 56 See footnotes 2, 11, 14 and 16 of this chapter, and see the previous chapter. 57 See Tractate Yoma 86b. 58 As explained previously in chapters 10 and 11, the Essence of the Infinite Light is higher than any divisions at all. In the Essence, these two sefirot are literally one essential heyulie power of G -d, and are not separate from each other since they are not separate from Him. 59 That is, we are capable of praying that even the very depth of absolute evil should be turned to the very depth of ab solute go od. Only G -d Himself possesses the ability to do this . It is through self -sacrifice that the essence of one ’ s being becomes revealed. This essence is the Yechida h , which is bound up with the Essence of G -d. It is for this reason that overturnin g the depth of evil into the d epth of good requires self - sacri fice and the revelation of the Yechidah . When a person breaks through all his limitations with"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"passed b efore him [and proclaimed, HaShem, HaShem, ] Benevolent and Gracious G-d etc”, [thus] transforming even essential judgment into kindn ess, as will be explained concerning the matter of the “T hirteen Fixtures of the Beard ” . 61 This will suffice for those of understanding. (This [ sub -division and int er-inclusion ] comes about by means of the aspect of the Kav V’Chut – Line and T hread, which possesses [something] of the power of the Essence of the Infinite Light, literally. 62 This in accordance to the statement of our Sages , 63 “[One must pray] to Him [a lone], and not to His qualities”, not even to His essential qualities . 64 All of this will, G -d willing, be explained. This will suffice for those of understanding.) End of Chapter Twenty Two       complete self -sacrifice in his service of G -d, then G -d will also “break through” and transcend al l the limitations He created. 60 Exodus 34:6 61 The concept of the “The Thirteen Fixtures of the Beard – Yud Gimel Tikkunei Dikna ” will be explained later, G -d willing. 62 It has already been explained at great length in chapter 15 that all sub -division and inter -inclusion throughout the entire chaining down is only possible by means of Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - the Essence of the Infinite Light, as it radiates within the Kav . 63 See Pardes Rimonim of the RaMaK, Shaar 32 ( Shaar HaKavanah ), Chapter 2. 64 This is to sa y that although He includes all of these qualities within Him, nonetheless, in essence, He is above and beyond any of these qualities and is not defined by them. Rather, it is He who defines them and brings them forth, out of His essence and into expressi on through the revelation of the Kav . As mentioned previously, He is “not of any of these qualities whatsoever” since He is an absolute unity and singularity which is absolutely unlimited. It is therefore clear that it is He who defines and limits, thus bringing forth and def ining and limiting the various sefirot . However, for this same reason, He is certainly capable of unifying the “opposites”, even the essential opposites, which He Himself brought forth, (since in essence, in Him they do not conflict, and are not opposites). From all of the above it is clear that it is improper to pray to anything aside from the very essence of G -d Himself.

This is [the meaning of the statement, 6 ] “[The King who alone is exalted...] who transcends the days of the world” . 7 Because of this it is called “ Atik Yomin – The Ancient of Days ” . [ Atik ] shares the same etymological root as “ HaMa’atik Hareem – W ho removes Mountains” . 8 [In other words, Atik Yomin ] is removed from the days of the world. 9 Now, all this is well known. Now, we must understand this in a manner of particulars , since Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin are considered to be one , 10 except that in general , the aspect of Atik Yomin is considered to be the end of the Infinite World, whereas the aspect of Arich Anpin is the root and beginning of the Emanated [worlds], as stated 11 in Etz Chaim . 12 As is known, the explanation of these matters is that these [two levels of Keter ] are the aspects of pleasure and desire. 13 Now, we observe that within every desire there is a   1 This refers to the aspect of Adam Kadmon , as explained in chapter nineteen. 2 This refers to the world of Atzilut – Emanation. 3 See Etz Chaim, Shaar 42 ( Shaar Drushei A BY”A ), Chapter 1. 4 In other words, Keter is like a link in a chain, the top of which is connected to the link above it, and the bottom of which is connected to the link below it. 5 In Hebrew these are called the, “ Gimmel Reishin – Three Heads”, and refer to the three upper sefirot of Keter. These are Keter, Chochmah and Binah of Keter. 6 See Yotzer blessing. 7 The particulars of the investment of Atik Yomin within Arich Anpin and the world of Atzilut – Emanation, will be explained in the next chapter. How ever, generally speaking, the meaning of the verse is as follows: The name Atik Yomin – Ancient of Days really has two parts, “Ancient”, which means “Removed” and “Days”. As mentioned previously, “days” always refers to the seven lower emotional sefirot, which correspond to the days of the world. Therefore, it is understood that the seven lower sefirot of Atik Yomin have some relationship with the “days” of the worlds, while the upper three sefirot remain “Removed” and transcend all Creation. They are un limited, i.e. above “time” and “days”. This then is the meaning of the reference to the statement, “Who transcends the days of the worlds etc”. 8 Job 9:5 9 That is, it is still completely unlimited, and above “days” and time etc. 10 That is, they are two a spects of the single entity of Keter . 11 See Etz Chaim, Shaar 42 ( Shaar Drushei ABY”A ), Chapter 1. 12 See footnote four, and the analogy of a chain. 13 That is to say, Atik Yomin corresponds to pleasure, while Arich Anpin corresponds to desire."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"pleasure, and if not for the pleas ure there would be no desire for the thing at all.

That is, he will derive no pleasur e whatsoever from something he has no desire for. If so, then desire is internal to pleasure. What we see is that the one cannot exist without the other , because desire cannot exist without pleasure, and pleasure cannot exist without desire. According t o this, we must say that the two are o ne, because it is only by means of their being bound together as one, that [ Keter ] exist s.

However, the principle [proof for this ] is from t he fact that it 19 will flee and become withdraw n due to pain. This is a   14 In other wor ds, it appears that pleasure is the cause of desire, and therefore the more inner of the two. 15 This means that the two are interdependent and necessary to each other, whether it is a simple essential pleasure and desire, like the desire and pleasure to li ve, or whether it is a composite desire and pleasure, such as the desire for wealth, which is not an essential desire. 16 Or... love and hate etc. 17 This has already been explained at great length in chapter six. 18 Commensurate to a person’s pleasure in any g iven thing, to that degree will be his pain in the absence of this pleasure. The lack of the pleasure comes about because of an opposing force, so, for example, one’s pleasure in being alive is not revealed until an “opposing force” comes to bring his life to an end (G -d forbid). It is specifically then, that his pleasure in being alive becomes revealed as a consequence of the agony he feels in its opposite. For example, a person does not realize or appreciate how much he enjoys breathing until he no long er can breathe. Of course, this is not to say that he did not appreciate and delight in breathing prior to this. However, usually a person is not conscious of the pleasure of breathing. What reveals this pleasure is the opposing force, when he cannot bre ath. From this we see that the pleasure in something and the agony experienced when it is missing, are literally commensurate to each other. According to how much pleasure he has in any given thing, will be how much agony he will have when he does not ha ve it. 19 The soul..."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"greater proof [of this phenomenon ]. 20 It is for this reason that the early Kabbalists decreed and stated that pleasure is considered to be of the essence of the soul, and they stated 21 that “There is nothing loftier than pleasure”. However, t his is not [entirely ] true. Rather, the essence of the soul becomes filled with great pleasure, and its entire essence is drawn aft er it, to the point that it may expire when it is almost entirely d rawn into it. 22 This is like [the verse, 23 ] “my soul expire s etc”. The reverse is likewise true, that it will expire and its light will be completel y and absolutely diminished by the intensity of extreme pain [or anguish] , as is known. 24 Now, an even clear er proof [of this] is from what we observe regarding even the particular powers of the soul ; that it is mainly the pleasure in a particular power which establish es its existence at all times. For example, [regar ding] the power of the quality of kindness; although it is essential and natural in the nature of [one who is] good to bestow goodness, [nonetheless,] its principal existence [comes about from] the pleasure, in that he takes pleasure in influencing goodness. The true existence of his good nature is that by nature he take s great pleasure from [bestowing] goodness, to the point that the main vitality of his soul comes about through the pleasure [that he derives by doing acts of] goodness and kindness. 25 The reverse is true of someone who is cruel by na ture. This only means that his entire vitality is the pleasure [that he derives] from perpetrating evil and cruelty, as is known. Likewise, the pr imary existence of the quality of Victory is the immense pleasure [which he derives], to the point that the entire vitality of his soul is drawn into being triumphant over his fellow. 26 Shou ld he not be victorious, he may [actually] become ill. 27 S imilarly , this is the case with eac h and every particular quality, including Insight ( Chochmah ) and D esire ( Ratzon ). Their principal existence and source is the pleasure [of them] , as is clearly observable that without the pleasure in conceptualization a person will not have the power to innovate any insight . 28 This is in accordance with the statement, 29 “ Were it not ... for the pleasure in   20 The proof from the fact that the soul flees and withdraws from pain is greater than the proof from pleasure. This is because, usually, matters that give us the greatest pleasure are not consciously felt. For example, the essential pl easure of being alive is usually not felt or appreciated until one’s very life is at stake, G -d forbid. It is specifically pain, which is the opposite of pleasure, which is the great indicator of where one’s pleasure lies. 21 See Sefer Yetzirah, Chaper 2, Mishna 4. 22 The very essence of the soul itself cannot be described as “pleasure”, for it is a quintessential singularity which is beyond any description or definition, whatsoever. Rather, the essence of the soul is only drawn after pleasure and finds it s expression by means of pleasure, nonetheless, it itself is beyond pleasure, and does not require pleasure to exist. Rather, it is specifically pleasure which draws the light of the soul into the body, thus enlivening it with great vitality. On the other hand, pain and anguish causes the light of the soul to withdraw, into itself. 23 Psalms 84:3 24 This is because, as mentioned above (and in chapter 6), pleasure and pain are two sides of the same coin. 25 In other words, “the nature of kindness and goodness” is the same as saying “the nature to enjoy kindness and goodness”. The same principle holds true in regard to any other qualities and characteristics. 26 His competitor... 27 An example of this can be seen in athletes, whose entire life is invested in “winnin g” the Olympic gold medal etc. 28 It is clearly observable that specifically those who derive pleasure from the subject of their studies will have new insights in that subject. This is because it is, specifically, pleasure which arouses the faculty of Choc hmah - Insight (or any other faculty or quality). One who does not take pleasure in his studies will certainly not have insights in the subject."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"[Torah] study etc ” . 30 [Moreover ], as is known regarding the matter of, 31 “A man’s wisdom illuminates his face” , 32 that it is the “ Lachloochit – Moisture” within which is the Heyulie for pleasure , which is the source for the conceptualizati on of any concept. 33 However , it is only in regard to des ire that we observe that without desire there can no t be pleasure. 34 We fi nd this [phenomenon ] even in all the particular qualities. For example, if [a person] does no t desire kindness or judgment, h e will have no pleasure in them at all. 35 Similarly, if he does no t desire to become intelligent, he will find no ple asure in [intellectual pursuits ] at all. 36 Likewise, if he does not at all desire victory , he will have no pleasure in victory. [T he same is true of] self aggrandizement or all other worldl y pleasures, such as wealth or hon or and the like. Without desire, there is no pleasure in them , whatsoever. In other words, beca use this entire matter is that since the whole essence of the soul is draw n after the pleasure and desire, 37 therefore, all its particular powers also [derive ] their principal existence from the pleasure and the desire. 38 The absence of [pleasure and desire in a ny particular matter] is the pain of the matter, this being the opp osite of pleasure. If something [stands in] opposition to [his] desire, although , [in and of itself], it is not [necessarily] a painful thing, he will automatically be agonized by it.       29 See Zohar , Toldot 138a. 30 The Zohar relates: Rabbi Yitzchak the son of Rabbi Yossi was traveling from Kaputki a to Lud. He encountered Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yitzchak said to him, “Say that our associates, the Sages of the Mishnah, should be awaken to this matter; that the Yetzer Hara (lust) should be banished from the world, except during the time of marital relat ions.” [Rabbi Yehuda] answered him, “By your life! The Yetzer Hara (lust) is necessary for the world, just as rain [is necessary] for the world. If not for the Yetzer Hara (lust), there would be no pleasure in learning [Torah].” In other words, the ple asure in study (to the point that he lusts for it) is its most necessary component. 31 Ecclesiastes 8:1 32 He derives great pleasure from his studies. Therefore “it illuminates his face”. If he did not truly enjoy it, he would not study. 33 It is explained ( Tanya, chapter 1) that the foundation of water is the source of all pleasures. Moreover, it was explained previously, that in order to have a flash of insight one must be “sublimated” to the subject. This sublimation was called “The hidden pleasure”. Th at is, he is so engrossed in the subject that he becomes totally unaware of himself. All he is aware of is the subject in which he is occupied. Moreover, he is so totally engrossed in it, that he is not even aware of the pleasure of it. This is why it i s referred to as “ hidden ” pleasure. As soon as he becomes conscious of himself and of the pleasure, he actually loses the deep concentration of being engrossed in the subject and he will lose the pleasure. It is this “sublimation” and “hidden pleasure” o f the entire self to the subject matter which is the source of all insights. 34 That is, all the other qualities require pleasure in order for them to exist. However, the quality of desire is equal to that of pleasure, and can actually be the cause for ple asure, as will be explained. In contrast, all other qualities are the effects of these two, pleasure and desire, which are actually one, as mentioned above. 35 An example of this is a parent who must discipline his child, even though he really does not des ire to be stern. Therefore, he certainly derives no pleasure from this. 36 This is true even though he may usually derive pleasure from intellectualization, if he is involved in something else which is important to him, during that time he will have no desi re for intellectualization, and will therefore derive no pleasure from it. 37 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (For, [just as with pleasure,] the desire also draws forth the entire soul, to the point where it can expire because of its desire for something, as is k nown.) 38 In other words, just as generally the two are interdependent, so too particularly, the two are interdependent. This is true even of the tiniest particular in all existence. In order for it to have any existence at all, G -d must have a particular desire and pleasure for it specifically, from which it receives its vitality.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Four Now, to one who con templates [how things are] above , the ana logue for all th at has been previously stated will be understood. [That is, he will understand ] how the aspect of the essence of the simple pleasure of the Essence of the Infinite Light, as it is before Tzimtzum, which is called , 1 “the Delight of the K ing in Himself”, is literally an infinite aspect . Moreover, [he will understand that] even the ten essential sefirot , from Keter to Malchut of Ein Sof , all [derive their existence ] from the simple pleasure in His Essence. By way of analogy, even the essential kindness of t he [human] soul , [derives] its existence primarily from the pleasure [of it] . 2 Nonetheless, in truth, the Essence of the Infinite Light is even beyond the aspect of simple pleasure. 3 However, it is drawn after and radiates within t he aspect of pleasure, just as the essence of the [human] soul is drawn after pleasure. It is for this reason that it was stated, 4 “T here is nothing loftier than pleasure”. 5 For example, [vested ] within the aspect of the desire for kindness of [G - d’s] Essence is the simple [ essential] pleasure. 6 It is drawn forth and radiates greatly, until it descends and even comes into a separate matter . 7 This [separate matter ] is the aforementioned aspect of the   1 See Emek HaMelech, Shaar Sha’ashuey HaMelech B’Atzmooto . 2 As explained in the previous chapter, the “nature of kindness” of the essence of the soul of a human being derives its existence from the simple pleasure that this person derives from matters of kindness and goodness. Likewise above, in the Essence of the Infinite Light, all the essential qu alities (which were explained in chapters 10 and 11) derive their existence from the simple pleasure of His Essence. (This principle applies throughout the entire chaining down of the worlds, that everything derives its existence from it Keter - the desir e, and more specifically from the pleasure for it.) 3 As in the analogy of the pleasure of the human being given previously, the essence of his soul cannot be described as “pleasure”. It is only that it is drawn towards pleasure, and it is pleasure which draws out the essence of the soul to become invest within the object of ones pleasure. Similarly, the Essence of the Infinite Light can in no way be described as “pleasure”. Rather, it is only drawn forth and expressed through pleasure, to radiate within the object of His pleasure. 4 See Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 2, Mishnah 4. 5 Pleasure is the most primal expression of the Essence of G -d. However, it itself is not the essence of G -d. Rather, as explained, just as in a human being, it is what draws the e ssence of the soul out. 6 For, as explained previously, the two (pleasure and desire) are inseparable. There can be no desire without pleasure, and there can be no pleasure without desire. Therefore, vested within G - d’s simple essential desire for kindne ss is His simple essential pleasure for it. 7 This is to say that this simple pleasure and desire draws the Essence out, even into a separate (composite) thing. As explained in the previous chapter, even the most external mundane thing can draw out practi cally the entire human soul if he derives great pleasure from it. Moreover, it is this pleasure which draws his essential self towards this thing which gives it its “existence” for him. Otherwise, he would not even have any thoughts of this thing at all, if he had no pleasure in it. However, in the analogy of man, he does not actually create the object of his desire, but is only drawn towards it. Now, in the analogue, which is G -d"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Primal Pleasure and Desire ( Ta’anoog V’Raton HaKadoom ), which follows the Tzimtzum , to become the source for the [entire] chaining down of the worlds of 8 ABY”A . 9 It descends [further], to the point where it is drawn down at the very end of everything, such as even the most final particular of the ten sefirot of [the world of] At zilut – Emanation . 10 This is [understood] by way of the aforementioned analogy of the pleasure which is found to give existence to the [emotional] quality of Victory ( Netzach ), and the like. 11 This , then , is the [meaning] of the statement in Etz Chaim , tha t Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin, which are the pleasure and the desire, are one entity , 12 and that the one cannot be without the other. [ Keter, which is the pleasure and desire , is ] invested within each and every sefirah , [even] in the most particular of spec ific s, for without it, it can have no existence at all, as previously explained at length. 13 Moreover, it [also] encompasses them all. 14       above, his desire and pleasure for something is what gives it its very ex istence, even the most mundane of “separate” things. 8 This is an acronym for the worlds Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 9 Although in comparison to the pleasure and desire of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin the Primal Desire is still considered to be par t of the Essence, in comparison to the simple essential desire of the Essence of the Infinite Light, it is already considered to be a separate thing. That is, it is the desire for the entirety of creation, which is a “separate thing”. So, although it is not yet a specific pleasure and desire for the particulars of Creation, but is rather the desire for the entirety of creation as a whole, nonetheless it relates to Creation and in this context is therefore considered a “separate” thing. However, the point here is that it is the essential pleasure and desire which is what gives existence to all of Creation as a whole. 10 That is to say, it is this very same essential pleasure which gives existence even to the most final particulars at the very end of creatio n. For, if there was no pleasure or desire in it, it would not exist. 11 That is, his entire essence is drawn forth into this single particular matter, and is what enlivens this quality. Were it not for his essential pleasure and desire for this matter, h is essential self and life force would not be invested in it, giving it existence. 12 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (They are called the “three heads which are engraved, one within the other. Sometimes one [pleasure] is internal [and sometimes desire is inter nal] etc, as mentioned previously.) See Zohar ( Idra Zuta ) Ha’azinu 288a. Also see Etz Chaim ( Shaar Arich Anpin ) Shaar 13, Chapter 2. [Now, up to this point, we have only spoken of two “heads”, i.e. the revealed pleasure and the revealed desire. However , there is also a third “head” which is called “ Reisha D’lo Ityada – The Head which is not known”, which refers to the concealed pleasure (referring to the three upper sefirot of Atik Yomin (pleasure) which do vest within Arich Anpin, as will soon be expla ined). This is similar to the pleasure in living, which is not a consciously felt pleasure at all. Rather, it is only felt when one’s life is threatened, as previously explained. In contrast, the other two “heads” refer to the revealed pleasure and desi re, which are consciously felt.] 13 That is, in the sefirotic scheme of Yosher , the pleasure and desire is the most internal force, and is the inner vitality of all subsequent levels, all the way until the most final action. It is the pleasure and desire vested within the action that gives it its vitality, and its very existence. Moreover, it is also all encompassing, as in the scheme of Igullim , where it is the pleasure and desire of the self which encompasses all the particular desires that a person will come to want. 14 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere with the analogy of the ten pits which are dug in succession. The [water in the] first is drawn into each [subsequent] pit etc. Likewise, it states in the Zohar , “He made a big vessel, [like a person who makes a big excavation, which becomes filled with the water that comes out of a spring... He then made a small vessel, which is the letter Yud, which became filled with it from the source ( Keter ), and He cal led it a spring flowing with Chochmah - Insight.] Through it, He called Himself, ‘ Chacham – Wise’, [and the vessel He called Chochmah - Insight.]” Similarly it states, “You brought out ten ‘ Tikkunim – Vessels’ and called them ten sefirot etc”.) [In othe r words, although the first “pit” and the last “pit” are two different “pits”, nonetheless, the inner vitality of them all is the same. This is similarly the case with the analogy of the “vessels”. Vested within all of these vessels, is the essential ple asure of the self, and it is what enlivens and animates the vessels. When the essential pleasure of G -d is vested within the vessel of Chochmah, He is called “wise”. When"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" Now, the aspect of Atik Yomin is considered to still be a part of the Infinite World. 15 This is bec ause the Infinite Wo rld is considered to continue until the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon , which is the aspect of the “letters” of the end action which arose in the aforementioned Primal Thought and Desire ( Machshava V’Ratzon HaKadoom ). 16 It is [these “letters”, which are] the last level of the Essence, that become the Keter of Atik Yomin , which is the aspect of the revelation of the light of the pleasure from the aforementioned concealed pleasure and Primal Desire ( He’elem Ha’Oneg V’Ratzon HaKadoom ). Therefore, even Keter of Atik Yomin , and the [ sefirot ] of Chochmah, Binah and the emotions which are within it, are all considered to be of the end of the Infinite World. 17 However, [this is not the case] with Arich Anpin , which is the aspect of the revelation of the desire wh ich comes because of the pleasure. Because [the desire] is drawn to spread forth below, it is called the beginning and root of the Emanations, which refers to the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut , both generally and particularly. 18 It is for this rea son that the aspect of Keter is generally called an intermediary aspect , which possesses something of the last level of the Essence, but is the beginning of the Emanated. Because the lights of the Emanated are in an aspect of “the revela tion of the concea led”,       this same essential pleasure of the Self of G -d is vested within the vessel of Ches sed , He is called “kind” etc. The inner life force and vitality of them all though, is the pleasure which draws the essence of G -d forth, to be vested within these “vessels”. (The very same passage of Zohar states, “He called Keter (i.e. pleasure and des ire) ‘the Source’.) This is analogous to the qualities of a human being. When a human being has an essential pleasure and desire for kindness, (which gives existence and vitality to the kind acts that he will subsequently do), then he is called “kind” etc . See Ma’amirei Admor HaZaken, HaKtzarim , page 492. See also, Zohar ( Ra’ayah Mehemnah ) Bo 42b, and introduction of Tikkunei Zohar 17a. 15 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Drushei ABY”A ) Shaar 42, Chapter 1. See also Shaarei Teshuvah of Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch, page 104. 16 As previously explained, the end action which arose in thought first is the thought of the pleasure of the self. (The analogy given previously was the desire and thought of oneself sitting as opposed to the desire for a chair). This Primal Thou ght and Desire is still focused entirely towards the essence, and the essential pleasure mentioned above. 17 This is because, although the pleasure is already a pleasure in an external thing (like the aforementioned chair), nonetheless, the aspect of the pl easure for this desire is still entirely focused towards the self, and is literally bound with the self. This is the case with the pleasure behind every desire. Although the desire already relates outwards, towards the external object of the desire, none theless, the pleasure is still entirely for the self and is still entirely bound with the essential pleasure of the self. For example, even in the desire for the chair, the pleasure aspect of this desire is still entirely for him. He, in his essence is d rawn after the pleasure he will derive from the fulfillment of this desire, as mentioned previously. Therefore, Atik Yomin , which is the pleasure aspect of Keter , is still considered to be part of the Infinite World, and literally connected to the essence of G -d. (This is true even of the pleasure which is vested within the desire for the most final particular specific in the entire chaining down.) 18 In other words, in contrast to the pleasure which is still focused on the self, the desire is focused on t he external object of one’s desire. Therefore, the revealed desire is already considered to be “the beginning and head of the emanations”. (Now, it is only relative to the pleasure that it is considered “separate” and relating to the external “object”. However, in truth, even the desire is entirely bound with the self. For, although the desire, “I want such and such ”, relates to the external thing “such and such”, nonetheless, really the main part of the desire is the “ I want ”. However, relative to the pleasure, the desire is considered to relate entirely to the “external” object of desire.)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"they therefore are in an aspect of separateness from the Essence, as previously explained (in chapter nineteen 19 ). 20 By way of analogy, this is like the emotions of Chessed or Gevurah for a separate thing which come from the power of the qualities of Chessed and Gevurah of the Essence. Nevertheless, it is the aspect of the pleasure and desire which comes from the Essence, which vests within everything in order to constantly give them existence, as mentioned previously. This is because , the source of this pleasure and desire is in the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) , and is called “the Delight of the King in Himself” ( Sha’ashoo’ei HaMelech B’Atzmo ). This is similar to the [aforementioned] analogy of the soul which is drawn after ev ery pleasure, which is proof that the pleasure fills its light. If so, then this itself is the reason that it is from the particular pleasure with in each of the particular [emanations of ] lights that they primarily [derive] their existence. [This is true ] even until the aspect of Malchut, which is the [quality of] Dominion. Were it not for the pleasure in it, it would have no existence. The absence of the light of the pleasure [f or something] equals the absence of the light of its existence. This will suffice for those of understanding. Now, all of the above is only in a general manner. In a particular manner, however, it is only the aspect of the first three [ sefirot ] of Atik Yomin which are considered to be [part] of the Essence. On the other hand, the seven lower sefirot of [ Atik Yomin ] become invested within the “ Gulgulta – Skull” 21 of Arich Anpin . Chessed (Kindness) of Atik Yomin [vests] within the “ Gulgulta – Skull” [of Arich Anpin] , Gevurah [of Atik Yomin vests] within “ Mocha Stima’ah – the Hidd en Brain” 22 [of Arich Anpin ] etc. 23 This , then , is the meaning of [the statement, 24 “The King who alone is exalted] , who transcends the days of the world”. 25 This is because the coming into being of the desire from the pleasure is primarily from the aspect of the emotions of the pleasure , as is known . 26 For example, Chessed (kindness) of the pleasure [vests within Keter of the desire]. 27 By way of analogy, when a person is in a state of pleasure during the joy of his son ’s wedding, or the like, he will then b estow goodness and   19 In the Hebrew text it says (chapter 12), but it is a typo which should say (chapter 19), as corrected above. 20 This has already been explained at length in chapte r 19. 21 The “ Gulgulta – Skull” is another name for Keter of Arich Anpin , i.e. the desire. 22 “ Mocha Stima’ah – The Hidden Brain” refers to Chochmah of Arich Anpin (which was mentioned previously, and is called “the hidden reason for the desire”). 23 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Arich Anpin ), Shaar 13, Chapters 6 & 7. 24 See Yotzer blessing. 25 As explained in footnote 7 of chapter 23, “days” always refers to the seven lower emotional sefirot, which correspond to the days of the world. Therefore, it is understood that the seven lower sefirot of Atik Yomin have some relationship to the “days” of the worlds, while the upper three sefirot remain “Removed” and transcend all Creation. They are unlimited, i.e. above “time” and “days”. This then is the meaning of the referen ce to the statement, “Who transcends the days of the worlds etc”. The investment of the emotional sefirot of Atik Yomin (pleasure) within the sefirot of Arich Anpin (desire) will now be explained. 26 This is to say that the desire is born specifically of t he expression of the felt and revealed pleasure. 27 The attribute of Chessed is the expression and spreading forth of something with abundance (as opposed to Gevurah which is the restraint). Therefore, Chessed of Atik Yomin represents the abundance of felt pleasure in something. The abundance of pleasure in something is what enlivens and arouses the power of desire. It is clearly observable that the more pleasure there is in any given thing, the more desire there is for it. This then is the explanation o f how Chessed of Atik Yomin (pleasure) vests within Keter of Arich Anpin (desire)."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"abundant kindness upon everyone. [This is ] because of the pleasure which uplifts his soul (for the aforementioned reason 28 ). D uring this time he may be aroused to grant every desire. In other words , even a desire for judgment may be ove rturned to kindness. 29 This [overturning of the desire from Chessed to Gevurah ] is dependant upon the aspect of the [essential] point of desire, which is higher than the “hidden reason for the desire” ( Ta’am Kamoos LaRatzon ), which divides into Chessed and Gevurah – kindness and judgment. This , then , is an analogy through which one may understand how the aspect of Chessed of Atik Yomin vests within the “ Gulgulta – Skull” [of Arich Anpin ]. Now, the aspect of Gevurah , which is judgment, the opposite of plea sure , is what vests within “ Chochmah Stima’ah – the Hidden Wisdom ” of Arich Anpin , which is the “hidden reason for the desire” ( Ta’am Kamoos LaRatzon ). This is the precision of the desire, that it should be in one particular way, and not in any other way. 30 This is in accordance with what is written in the books of Kabbalah, 31 that the early [Kabbalists] dec reed a statement that Chochmah is an aspect of judgment. This is because, when desire comes according to the dictates of Chochmah , it comes with precisi on and restriction that it should by one [specific ] way and no other. For this reason, there are many judgments in the laws of the Torah, since the Torah comes out of [G - d’s] upper Chochmah . 32 In contrast, the radiance of the thirteen attributes of mercy is from [a level] higher than the Chochmah of the desire, and can [therefore] “ pardon iniquity ” . 33 Certainly [th is is the case in regard to ] the aspect of the first three sefirot of Atik Yomin which are not invest within the Emanated. This is the aspect o f the pleasure as it is within Himself . As of yet, n o desire has been born of it whatsoever , except that all desires are destined to come from it. It is considered to be part of the general essence of the simple pleasure ( HaTa’anoog HaPashoot ). That is, it is from the aspect of the source of all pleasures in the Essence of the Infinite Light   28 That is, it is the pleasure which draws the essential light of his soul out into expression. (Therefore, when a person is happy he will be very giving and generous, while when he is sad or depressed he is withdrawn etc.) 29 In other words, the pleasure of a person actually reaches the very essence of his soul, which can change from a desire of sternness to kindness, as explained. (Similarly, the pleasure one gives to G -d ( through the fulfillment of Torah and Mitzvot) actually reaches the very Essence of G -d, and can cause a change from a desire for sternness to a desire for kindness. More profoundly, the fulfillment of the Torah and Mitzvot actually causes the Essential Li ght of G - d’s Essence to be drawn forth into Creation. This is because the pleasure, even from a completely external thing, reaches to the very essence of one’s being and draws its light forth, as previously explained. Similarly, when one sins it also reac hes the very essence of G -d, and is the opposite of pleasure. This can affect a change from kindness to sternness, for the very same reason. Moreover, it causes the Essential Light of G -d to be withdrawn from Creation.) 30 In other words, Gevurah of Atik Yomin is the revelation of displeasure. That is, it is the revelation of a precise pleasure, in a certain thing, in a certain way. This becomes invested in Chochmah of Arich Anpin , the wisdom of the desire. That is, it is what dictates that the desire s hould be in a specific manner, and not in any other manner. 31 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Arich Anpin ) Shaar 13, Chapter 6. 32 See Zohar ; BeShalach 62a, Yitro 85a, ( Ra’aya Mehemna ) Mishpatim 121a, Kedoshim 81a, Chukat 182a and Ve’Etchanan 261a. 33 That is, the thi rteen attributes of mercy are rooted in Keter of Arich Anpin (and higher). It is for this reason that they have the ability to “pardon iniquity”. For, although according to Chochmah of Keter one may be guilty and liable, when G -d has desire and pleasure in this person ( Keter of Arich ), he will overlook his faults. This is similar to how one will overlook and pardon the faults of a person he loves and desires. (Whereas, he will not overlook these same faults in someone he does not love or have desire for .)"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). This is as stated, 34 “With you is the source of life”, 35 i.e. the source of all the pleasures [within] the Primal Desire [for Creation] ( Ratzon HaKadoom ). 36 In the general 37 totality [of the chaining down] it this called 38 “ Atika D’Atikin – The Ancient of the Ancients”. 39 [However, more particularly ] it is called “ Atik Yomin – The Ancient of Days”, as stated in Daniel, 40 “And Atik Yomin sat etc”. [ Atik – Ancient] is a terminology of antiquity, which [indicates] the aspect of the eternity of the Essence of the Infinite Light as He comes to radiate within the chaining down of the line and thread. However, in regard to His actual Essence [it states, 41 ] “Is there old age before the Holy One blessed be He ! ?” 42 This is in accordance with what is stated elsewhere 43 regarding the matter of the word “ Va’ed – Forever” ( ועד ), which thr ough a permutation of letters equals “ Echad – One” ( אחד ), referring to the simple [oneness] Himself. 44 For, when the Essence of the Infinite Light , which transcends [even] the time of “ Yemei Kedem – the Days of o ld” , radiates within time, th en time too becomes eternal and is then called “ Atik Yomin – the Ancient of Days”. This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Twenty Four   34 Psalms 36:10 35 Note how the verse states, “ With you is the source of life ” (i.e. the pleasure and desire). However, it does not say “ You are the source of life”. This is because, although the Essence is drawn after pleasure, it cannot itself be des cribed as pleasure, as previously explained. 36 That is to say, it is G - d’s pleasure and desire for the entirety of Creation which gives it it’s “life” and very existence. 37 See footnote 5 of chapter 18 for the explanation of the “general chaining down” and the “particular chaining down”. 38 See Zohar ( Idra Rabba ) Naso 128a. 39 As previously explained, Atika D’Atikin is the pleasure for all of Creation as a whole, while Atik Yomin is the revelation of the particular pleasures for particular creations within th is whole. (See large parenthesis in chapter 17, and footnotes there.) 40 Daniel 7:9 41 See Tractate Yevamot 16b. 42 That is to say, the concept of the eternity of time is applicable only as the Infinite Light radiates within Creation, thus causing Creation to be Eternal in time. However, the Essence of G -d Himself is beyond even being termed “eternal”, for He is entirely beyond any concept of “time”. 43 See Zohar Terumah 134a. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Dvarim , volume 1, page 224. See also, Ma’a marei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Nevi’im V’Ktuvim, page 226. 44 The word “ Echad – One” ( אחד ) is the last word of the verse, “ Shma Yisrael HaShem Elokeinu HaShem Echad – Hear ‘O Israel, the L -rd our G -d, the L - rd is One”. The word “ Va’ed – Forever” ( ועד ) is the last word of the statement which follows the above verse in the Shma prayer, “ Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto L’Olam Va’ed – Blessed is the Name of His Glorious Kingdom forever and ever.” As mentioned previously, the first verse refers to the “Upper Unity” of G -d, which is the absolute singularity and oneness of His Essence (in the Upper Purity), and how only He exists. The second statement refers to the “Lower Unity”, i.e. how the created worlds are also totally one with G -d, and how His Light radiates and vests within the created realms. Therefore, when the absolute singularity of the Infinite Light (i.e. Echad – One) radiates within Creation, then Creation too becomes eternal (i.e. Va’ed – Forever). (This of course is only because G -d can bring entities into e xistence infinitely and eternally.)

The letters Chet and Ayin fall into the category of “guttural letters” ( Otiot Groniot ), and may likewise be interchanged. Hence “ Echad ” is the equivalent of “ Va’ed ”.

The reason they are called “Father” and “Mother” is because it is Chochmah , the “Father”, which provides the seminal flash of insight, which is subsequently developed in Binah , the “Mother”. (This unification gives birth to offspring, i.e. the emotions and actions, as will be explained later.) 4 See Likkutei Biurim (R’ Hillel Paritcher), chapter 25. 5 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Abba V’Imma ) Shaar 14, Chapter 1.

[In contrast,] Binah - Comprehension is called “Something – Yesh ”. 13 The light and influence of the “Nothingness” of Chochmah – Insight , radiates and is drawn into the aspect of the comprehension of Binah . T hat is, [there is a transition ] from “nothing” to “something” . 14 Moreover, [ Chochmah and Binah – Insight and Comprehension] are called , 15 “The two lovers who never separate” [about which it states, 16 ] “T hey dwell as one”. 17 This is the aspect of the “point” of Chochmah – Insig ht, which flashes like a lightning bolt from that which is above the intellect. (In common ter minology [this is called] “understanding”. 18 ) In other words , [ it flashes] from the potential pow er to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ), which is called “The Hidden Insight ” – Chochmah Steema’a of Arich Anpin . [This potential to conceptualize ] is called “the Concealed Insight – Chochmah HaNe’elama ”. It is the source that brings forth all intellect fr om “nothingness”, and is called “ Maskeel ” , as is known. 19 This , then , is the explanation of the statement that the light of Abba suckles from the eig hth “ Mazal ” [which is] “ Notzer ”. The letters [of the word “ Notzer ” may be rearranged to spell] “ Tzinor – P ipe”. [That is,] it is like a thin pipe. Similarly, the aspect of the “ Sa’arot – Hairs” of the eighth “ Mazal ” is the growth aspect of the aforementioned potential power to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ). That is, it sprouts forth all kinds of concepts from “nothingness” . 20       13. V'Nakeh - and He Cleanses. These “thirteen attributes of mercy” are often referred to as “the thirteen fixtures of the beard of Arich Anpin ”. The eighth and thirteenth attributes, “ Notzer ” and “ V’Nak eh ”, are referred to as “ Mazalot ”. The root of the word “ Mazal ” is “ Nozel ” which means “to flow down”. These two are called “the upper Mazal and the lower Mazal ”, because influence flows down from them to the intellectual sefirot of Chochmah and Binah , a s will be explained. (They are also referred to as the “Hairs – Sa’arot ” of the beard of Arich Anpin . This is because a hair is a narrow tube, which indicates an issuance of constricted influence down, just as the hairs of the beard grow downward etc.) The Rebbe will now explain these matters further. 10 The word Chochmah ( חכמה ) can be spelled as “the power of what” ( כח מה ), which is a reference to the aspect of the sublimation and “hidden pleasure” which gives rise to Chochmah – Insight. 11 See Zohar ( R a’aya Mehemnah ) Tzav, 28a, 34a. 12 Job 28:12 13 This is to say that Chochmah is the intangible intellect, while Binah is the concrete and tangible comprehension. (As mentioned in chapter one, Chochmah is only called “Nothingness” relative to Binah , however, relative to its source in Keter it too is called “Something”, as in the verse, “ Chochmah is found from nothing”, implying that it itself is a something.) 14 In other words, there is a transition and a “flash” of insight, from the intangible source of insig ht into tangible comprehension. 15 See Zohar Beshalach 56a, VaYikra 4a. 16 See Zohar ( Idra Zuta ) Ha’azinu , 290b. 17 This is because the one cannot function without the other. In order for the mind to comprehend, there must be a seminal concept to grasp throu gh analysis. On the other hand, the concept cannot exist in a vacuum. There must be a vessel to contain it and develop it. This vessel is the comprehension of Binah. For this reason these two sefirot are always found together. When one is thinking, h e must think about something. 18 For example, a person will have a flash of intuition or insight and say, “Oh, now I understand...” 19 This means that the Koach HaMaskeel – The Potential Power to Conceptualize, is the Heyulie ability and desire to bring forth new insights, and to conceive of all concepts. 20 See footnote 9. In other words, there is a constricted issuance of influence to the intellectual sefirah of Chochmah , which is expressed as the flash of insight and intuition in a subject matter. The sourc e of this"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" Now, the development (suckling) [of this seminal flash], that is, the growth of the brain of Abba (Insight) and the growth of the brain of Imma (Comprehension) , comes from the thirteenth “ Mazal ”, which is “ VeNakeh ”. 21 These two “ Mazal ot ” 22 , the upper “ Mazal ” and the lower “ Mazal ”, are the roots of the [intellectual] brains of Abba and Imma . This is to say that in the potential power to conceptualize itself, there is a root for the development of the brain of understanding ( Chochmah ), a nd a root for the development of the brain of grasp and comprehension ( Binah ). These [two , Chochmah and Binah ] are called “the brain of Abba ” and “the brain of Imma ”, as is known. Now, just as the aspect of the brain of Binah, which is the brain of grasp and comprehension , receives from the aspect of the “nothingness” of the brain of Chochmah, 23 so too , in their source there is a unification of the two “ Mazalot ” of “ VeNotzer ” and “ VeNakeh ” . 24 It is known that although the “ Mazalot ” are called “ Sa’arot – Ha irs”, which only break forth and come out from the aspect of the excess 25 of the “Hidden Brain” of Arich Anpin , nonetheless, their [true] source is from the essence of the “ Gulgulta – Skull”. 26 [This is to say that their source] is higher than the innerness of the “Hidden Brain” itself. It is for this       influence is the potential power to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ) of Arich Anpin - the desire. (In a way of analogy, hair is similar to a plant, which has roots and grows etc. Similarly, the flash of insight and intellect is rooted in the pote ntial power to conceptualize, and develops through the influence it receives from there.) 21 The Hebrew word “ VeNakeh – And Cleanse”, is related to the word “ Yenikah ”, which means “to suckle”. This is analogous to a child who suckles his mother’s milk, whi ch causes him to develop and grow. Similarly, the thirteenth Mazal, “ VeNakeh ”, is the source for the development of the insight so that it “matures and grows” into a fully developed idea. 22 This is the plural of the word “ Mazal ”. 23 This has already been e xplained at length in the beginning chapters of this book (and refers to the unification of Chochmah with Binah – Insight with Comprehension, which is brought about through Hitbonenut - contemplation and analysis. 24 In other words, in order for there to be conceptualization and comprehension, just as there must be a unification of the mind powers of Chochmah and Binah , there must likewise be a unification of these two matters in Keter - Desire, which is their source. ( If the potential power to bring out new insights a lone exists, but not the potential power to grasp and develop them, new insight cannot come about. The reverse is also tr ue. If there is only the potential power to develop the insight , but there is no insight to develop, the potential power to grasp and comprehend remains barren. The unification of both of these powers of Arich (desire ) is no less essential than the unification of Chochmah and Binah themselves .) 25 The flash of insight which comes forth from Chochmah - Insight into Binah - Compre hension is like an excess and “overflow” from the potential power to conceptualize. (This is another reason why they are called hairs, since hairs are an excess, so to speak, that come out from the brain and skull.) 26 In other words, although the influenc e comes through Chochmah of Arich Anpin (the desire), which is the potential power to conceptualize, nonetheless, the true source of this influence is actually in Keter of Arich Anpin (and even higher, within Atik Yomin ). This is to say that although the source of the insight is from the potential power to conceptualize, in truth it is the pleasure of it, which activates the potential power to conceptualize and spawns new insights. This refers to the aforementioned “hidden pleasure” and sublimation of Cho chmah , wherein one is totally invested in the subject to the point that he is not aware of himself (See chapter 5). It is called “hidden” pleasure, because he derives so much pleasure from it that he loses all awareness of self. It is this hidden pleasur e which is the true source of all insight. As is clearly apparent, it is impossible to have any new insights if this sublimation and “hidden pleasure” is absent."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"reason that they burst forth in an aspect of excess. This is analogous to the bursting forth of steam from the [pressure] of a tightly sealed [pot]. For example, when the potential power for intellect greatl y overwhelms the [power of] Chochmah, there is a fallout of excess [insight] from Chochmah [into Binah , i.e. from insight into comprehension]. 27 The source of thi s excess is higher than the actual light of the intellect itself. 28 It is for this reason that it states, “ The excess of the Upper Chochmah is Torah”, specifically in pr aise [of the Torah] , as explained elsewhere. 29 Likewise, this is the reason for the greatness of the thirteen attributes of mercy, which are called “the thirteen fixtures of the bea rd [of Arich Anpin ]” that come out of the excess of the “Hidden Brain - Mocha Steema’a ”. 30 This is as stated, “ And HaShem passed before him and proclaimed, ‘HaShem HaShem’” 31 . This is higher than the “Hidden Brain - Mocha Steema’a ”, which is called the “hidden reasoning and wisdom for the concealed desire” and is also called “The intellect which is hidden from all contemplation ” or “the wonders of Chochmah ”. 32   27 When a person truly grasps the intangible depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ), he is in a state of total sublimation to it, and is completely unaware of himself. As mentioned previously, this is called “the hidden pleasure” of Chochmah , or the Koach Mah – Power of What (i.e. sublimation) of Chochmah . Now, the flashes of insight and intuition, which come about because of this grasp of the depth, are not actually revelations of the depth itself. Rather, when one has a flash of insight into the depth of a subject, it is only the “excess fallout” which overflows from the Heyulie of the depth, int o his comprehension. It is for this reason that the flashes of insight and intuition into any subject are always only very short and terse insights which must be developed afterwards. The intangible depth itself, however, is concealed within these short flashes of insight. (These short flashes of insight are compared to an essence - Tamtzeet , from which many beverages may be mixed etc.) Similarly, it is stated in a way of praise, that the Torah is the “excess fallout” from the upper Chochmah . Although th e teachings of the Torah may appear to be short and external “stories”, nonetheless, it is the excess of the Upper Wisdom. Therefore, contained within the terse teachings of the Torah is the whole of the Infinite Light, which is the revelation of the Trut h of G - d’s Singular existence. (This is as stated that the inner aspect of Abba ( Chochmah ) is the inner aspect of Atik Yomin ). Therefore, when one contemplates the teachings of the Torah, his “hidden pleasure” (i.e. sublimation) and the “Sight of his min d’s eye” is specifically into G -d. The insights and explanations, which are the “fallout” of this perception, are insights and explanations into the true reality of G - d’s singular existence, and may be brought out infinitely, like an ever flowing spring. (This is known as the Choosh HaChassidut – The Sense of the Chassidut or the sense of the G -dliness of the concept. See Kuntres HaHitpa’alut by Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch.) 28 That is, the source of the excess is the “hidden pleasure” (i.e. Keter of Arich Anpin and even higher in Atik Yomin ), which is higher than the light of the intellect itself (i.e. Chochmah of Arich ). 29 See Imrei Binah (of Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch), Shaar HaKri’at Shma, page 57a. See also previous footnote for explanation of this st atement about the Torah. 30 This is to say that the source of these “excess hairs of the beard” is from the overflow of the essential pleasure ( Atik Yomin ). It is for this reason that they can “pardon iniquity” and are called the “thirteen attributes of me rcy”. (As mentioned previously, when one derives pleasure and desire from someone who he dearly loves, he will have mercy upon them, even when they have offended him. This is not the case with Chochmah of Arich Anpin , which is the “hidden reasoning of th e desire”, from which all of the specific laws of the Torah are derived, as explained at length in the previous chapter. See there.) 31 Exodus 34:6 32 In other words, this is from Keter of Arich Anpin (and higher), which is higher than the aspect of Chochmah of Arich Anpin , as previously explained at length."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"According to this, when it states that the light of Abba suckles from the [eighth] “ Mazal ”, this is a ctually [from] higher than the “Hidden Chochmah ” itself. 33 It is for this reason that it states, 34 “Everything is dependent upon Mazal , even the Sefer Torah (Torah Scroll) in the Heichal chamber”, which refers to the unification of Abba and Imma below. 35 [T his is ] the [flash of the] “point” of Chochmah in the chamber of Binah , from “nothing to something”, as mentioned above. 36 The [flash of insight from Chochmah to Binah ] is what is meant by, 37 “ Sefer – Book” and “ Seepoor – Story”, which is called “the Sefer Torah (Torah Scroll) in the Heichal chamber” , as is known . Now, this is much higher than the statement that Abba and Imma enclothe the “Arms” of Arich Anpin . 38 Moreover, this is certainly [higher] than the aspect of NeHi”Y of Arich Anpin as they are veste d within Abba and Imma . 39 [This is so] because, as is known, the aspect of the seven lower [ sefirot ] of Arich Anpin, are only the aspects of the emotional [ sefirot of] ChaGa”T 40 etc. 41 These are called, 42 “the Great Hand and the Mighty Hand”, and in the Zoha r they are also called by the term , 43 “The Mountains of Darkness”. 44 These are like mountains that are [so] high that the light of the sun does not shine upon them . 45 In other words, this is the aspect of the emotions of the   33 This means that although the overflow of the flash of insight is from Chochmah of Arich Anpin , its true source, from which it is aroused, is the “hidden pleasure” and sublimation to the concept, which i s from Keter of Arich Anpin and higher (in Atik Yomin – the pleasure). 34 See Zohar ( Idra Rabba ) Naso 134a. 35 See footnote 27 of this chapter. In other words, the Torah is compared to the seminal flash of insight from the intangible Chochmah, wh ich is con t ained within the “chamber” of Binah – comprehension, within which it is developed and its depth is brought out into revelation. This flash of insight is dependant upon the “ Mazal ”, i.e. the pleasure in it and the sublimation to it. 36 See Introduction of Zohar 6a. Also see Zohar Tetzaveh 180a. 37 See Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishnah 1. 38 This refers to how Chessed and Gevurah of Arich Anpin (Desire) become vested within Abba ( Chochmah of Atzilut ) and Imma ( Binah of Atzilut ), as will be explained. 39 This w ill soon be explained. 40 This is an acronym for Chessed, Gevurah and Tiferet . 41 That is to say, these are the emotional leanings of the desire. 42 Exodus 14:31, 13:9. ( “HaYad HaGedolah – The Great Hand” is Chessed and “ HaYad HaChazakah – The Mighty Hand” i s Gevurah .) 43 See Zohar Pinchas 249b. (“ Toorey D’Chashoocha – Mountains of Darkeness” and “ Toorey D’Nehorah – Mountains of Light”) 44 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (This is in accordance with what is known, regarding the teaching, “This gazelle goes to the mou ntains of darkness and gathers her food from there.” This refers to how Malchut goes up to ChaGa”T of Arich Anpin , as it states, “The ark was uplifted... in the seventh month” which refers to Rosh HaShanah , during which Malchut goes up to “ Harei Ararat ” whi ch is [translated by the Targum as] ‘the mountains of darkness’”.) [According to my understanding this can be understood as follows: On the holiday of Rosh HaShanah the Jewish people are judged for their actions of the past year. Now, although in truth “the sins are many” and we are guilty, nonetheless, because of G - d’s great love and desire for the Jewish people, He irrationally exonerates His beloved people, not based on any reasoning or intellect. This is the meaning of Malchut goes up to Chessed, Ge vurah and Tiferet of Arich Anpin, and “gathers food from there”. That is to say, the emotional aspect of G - d’s desire and love for the Jewish people is revealed, and they receive their sustenance and life from there.] 45 That is, these are the emotional sefirot of the desire, which cause the desire to lean towards either Chessed or Gevurah . Since these are the emotions of the desire, they are higher than the “radiance” of the intellect, which is called “light”. Therefore, these emotions do not follow the guidelines of rationale and reason, for as explained previously, “There is no reasoning for desire”. Rather, the contrary is true. It is"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"desire which are higher than rev ealed intellect and reasoning. In contrast, the emotions which are according to intellect and reasoning are called, “the Mountains of Light”, since Chochmah is called “Light”. However, the emotions of the desire are called “the Mountains of Darkness” , [for they are ] emotions hidden in the desire. [Now,] their source is from the aforementioned aspect of the “Hidden Wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ”, whi ch is called “The Concealed Insight - Ta’aloomot Chochmah ”. This is the matter of the “Hidden Reasoning for the Desire”, 46 from which the two lines of Chessed and Gevurah (Kindness and Judgment) of the desire divide . 47 This then is [the meaning of] the statement that the “Arms” of Arich Anpin vest within Abba and Imma . This is as we clearly obs erve that the root fo r intellectual reasoning [leaning] tow ards kindness and merit exists because of the quality of Chessed (Kindness) and the great love with in one ’ s desire. 48 This is similar to “a bribe, which blinds [the eyes of the wise ] etc”. 49 Because of the bribe, he ha s a love in [his] desire [towards this person]. He will therefore find justification and his intellectual powers will be caused to lean from [ a judgment of] guilt to merit. This is similar to [the Talmudic 50 account of] Rabbi Yishmael, who “took a basket of fruits... and said [to himself], ‘If he wishes he may justify [himself ] like this etc’. ” 51 [From the above] we find that the emotions [of Arich Anpin ] vest within the innerness of Abba and Imma , and that Abba and Imma are “worn” on the outside [like a gar ment] . 52 This is as stated, 53 “I am Binah , Gevurah ” of Arich Anpin , “is mine”, as explained in Etz Chaim . 54 This will suffice for those of understanding. Now, as the levels descend further, the intellectual [ sefirot ] of Chochmah and Binah of Atzilut , only receive from the aspects of Netzach and Hod of Arich Anpin . 55 That is, [these sefirot ]       these emotions of the desire which vest within the intellect, causing the intellect to conform to the desire and lean towards either Chessed or Gevurah , as will now be further explained. 46 This is the aspect of the “reasoning” of the desire, which dictates that the desire should be in one particular way, and not any other way, as previously explained. 47 This has already been explained at great length in chapter 21 and in the previous chapter. 48 This is to say that it is these emotions of the desire ( ChaGa”T of Arich Anpin ) which cause the intellect to lean towards either Chessed – Kindness or Gevurah – Severity. 49 Deutero nomy 16:19, also see Exodus 23:8 50 See Tractate Ketubot 105b. 51 When a judge accept s a bribe from the defendant, he can no longer be unbiased in judgment. His desire is to treat the defendant with kindness. Because of this, his intellect will also lean tow ard kindness in regard to the defendant and he will come up with logical justifications to exonerate the defendant. This illustrates how the i ntellect conforms to the desire, that is, how Chessed and Gevurah of Arich Anpin (the desire), become vested with in Abba and Imma (the intellect). 52 When these sefirot become vested within Chochmah – Insight ( Abba ) and Binah - Comprehension ( Imma ) , the intellect becomes like a garment that covers over them. The intellect conforms to the leanings of the desire, just a s a garment takes on the movements of the person who is wearing it. If the person moves to the left, his clothing will move along with him and if he moves to the right, his clothing will move along with him. 53 Proverbs 8:14. 54 See Etz Chaim , ( Shaar Abba V ’Imma ) Shaar 14, Chapter 2. 55 However, the actual influence is issued through the aspect of Yesod , which is a composite of Netzach and Hod , as previously explained."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"bring the influence of Chessed and Gevurah below. Similarly, in various places [the sefirot of] Netzach and Hod are called 56 “the Righteous Scales”, even in reference to the lower emotions which go according to the light of the intellect. 57 However , the emotions of the desire, which is called “ Arich Anpin – the Long Countenance ”, are unlimited, like the desire itself, which is unlimited. Therefore, even the aspects of Ne tzach and Hod are in an unlimited aspect. 58 This is as known regarding the explanation of the verse, “T he remembrance of Your abounding goodness 59 ”, that it refers to the aspect of Yesod of Arich Anpin . 60 This is likewise the case in the verses , “In Your gr eat goodness” 61 and “If he will redeem you, good” 62 and “G reat goodness for the house of Israel” 63 , and the like. 64 In contrast, the aspect of Yesod of “ Zeir Anpin – the Small Countenance ” 65 is th e aspect of the emotions which are born of Binah – Comprehensio n. They are in an aspect of great immaturity. 66 This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of 67 “The righteous [shall flourish] like the palm tree” , [that this ] refers to the aspect of Yesod of Zeir Anpin . 68 [In contrast, t he continuation of the verse is,] “He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon”, which refers to the aspect of Yesod of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin , which is in an   56 See Introduction of Tikkunei Zohar . 57 As explained previously (Chapter 21, footnote 23), the concept of the three lower sefirot of Netzach (Victory ) , Hod (Majesty) and Yesod (Foundation) is the matter of how the influence will be expressed to the recipient. The analogy given previously is as follows: W hen a parent wants to influence his chil d in a way of Netzach , he explains to him why he should think or act in a certain way until he has “won him over” to his way of thinking or acting. This is the aspect of Netzach (Victory), where he brings out influence to “win over” the opposition etc. I n contrast, the word “ Hod ” also mean s, “submission”, as in the word “ Hoda’ah ”. Therefo re, in the parent/child relationship, when the parent demands that the child should act or desist from acting in a certain way, not because he has “won him over” to his way of thinking, as with Netzach , but by force of authority alone , this is an influence of Hod . Yesod represents the “scales” of the gut emotions which determines how the actual issuance of influence from the influencer to the recipient should come out . That is, should the influence be in a way of Netzach, should it be in a way of Hod, or should it be a synthesis of the two. In Arich Anpin , these three sefirot represent the determination within the desire of how the desire should be expressed and brought out into fruition and actuality. 58 For example, the desire to actualize a “house” as it is within Netzach, Hod and Yesod of the desire ( Arich Anpin ) is the desire to actualize an infinite house. It is only in the intellect that this desire becomes limite d according to the circumstances etc. 59 Psalms 145: 60 As will be explained later in chapter 36, the aspect of Yesod is called “good”. Therefore, “abounding goodness” refers to the infinite aspect of Yesod of Arich Anpin . 61 Siddur, Morning prayers 62 Ruth 3:13 63 Isaiah 63:16 64 See footnote 60 above. All these verses are referring specifically to Yesod of Arich Anpin . 65 As will later be explained, Zeir Anpin – the Small Countenance, refers to the limited heartfelt emotions which follow and receive from the intellectual sefirot of Abba and Imma . 66 That is, they are not as unlimited as the desire, and are of a far lesser quality. (Nonetheless, as will later be explained (in chapters 32 and 33), the heartfelt emotions of Zeir Anpin are still completely bound u p with the Essence of the Infinite Light - Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof .) 67 Psalms 92:13 68 As will be explained later, (Chapter 36), Yesod of Zeir Anpin is called “ Tzaddik – the Righteous” since all influence comes into the world through the merit of the Righteous, a s stated, “ Tzaddik Yesod Olam – the Righteous is the foundation of the world”."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"infinite aspect . 69 Similarly, it states 70 regarding King Solomon , “He spoke [of trees,] from the ced ar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop [that springs out of the wall ] ”. [The hyssop] refers the aspect of the smallness of Yesod of Zeir Anpin as it is in Malchut , which is called 71 “a wall”. 72 End of Chapter Twenty Five   69 The Hebrew word “ Levanon – Lebanon” shares the same root as the term “ Loven HaElyon – The Supernal Whiteness (i.e. purity)”, which refers to Keter of the world of Atzilut (i.e. Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin ). Therefore, this second part of the verse refers to Yesod of Keter . 70 Kings I 5:13 71 See Zohar VaYechi 228b and Terumah 133a. 72 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (As is known in the [Kabbalistic] intentions of [the prayer], “Amen , May His Great Name be blessed”, that “His Name” ( Shmo – שמו ) has the same numerical value as “Desire” ( Ratzon – רצון ). [Moreover,] “His Great Name” refers to the aspect of Yesod and Malchut of Arich Anpin , in that they should be “drawn down” into Abba, Imma , Zeir Anpin, and Nukvah, so that the “right” overpowe rs the “left”. This is like [the statement,] “In Your great goodness, let your fierce anger turn away from Your people etc”.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Six We must now understand the further descent of the light [as it is] within the ten sefirot of Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension) themselves. 1 [That is, we must understand] how the inner aspect of the brains of Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension) receive [influence] from Chessed and Gevurah of Arich Anpin (Kindness and Sternness of Desire) . 2 Moreover, [we must] certainly [understand] as they ascend to receive from the Mazalot of Arich Anpin , as mentioned previously. [Finally, we must understand] the external aspect of NeHi”Y 3 of Abba and Imma (The Gut emotions of Insight and Comprehension) which vest within the “brains” of Zeir Anpin (Intellect of the Emotions) , as stated 4 in Etz Chaim . 5 Now, the [expla nation of this ] matter is known, that the inner aspects of the brains of Abb a and Imma are likened to Shabbat and Yom Tov . 6 This is because Shabbat , which is referred to as 7 “ Kodesh – Holy”, is [observed] through the pleasure of “ Chochmah which is a thing unto itself”. 8 This is the aspect of the inner light of Abba - Insight (whic h is the innerness of Atik   1 As previously explained, Abba and Imma corres pond to the Partzufim (Statures) of the intellectual qualities of Chochmah and Binah (Insight and Comprehension) of the world of Atzilut . In this chapter the Rebbe will explain how the intellectual sefirot of Atzilut function according to the various ways that influence is received from Arich Anpin (Desire). (The three general ways that the intellectual Partzufim of Abba and Imma receive their influence from Arich Anpin was explained at length in the previous chapter. Also, as mentioned at the beginning of the previous chapter, it is assumed that the reader has a fine grasp of everything that has been explained up to this point, specifically the first few chapters of the book which explained the workings of the intellect.) 2 In the previous chapter, Chess ed and Gevurah of Arich Anpin were referred to as the “Arms” of Arich Anpin which vest within Abba and Imma etc. 3 This is an acronym for the sefirot of Netzach, Hod and Yesod . 4 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar Drushei HaNekudot ) Shaar 8 Chapter 2. See also Shaar 16 ( Shaar Holadat Av”I V’Zu”N ) Chapter 7. 5 This is to say that we must understand how the intellect influences the emotions and actions which follow from the intellect and are below it. (These are called Zeir Anpin and Nukvah ). 6 Shabbat refers to the seven th day of rest, the Sabbath , while Yom Tov refers to the Jewish Holidays in which work it prohibited, such as Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot and Rosh HaShana. Nonetheless certain types of labor are permitted on these holidays, even though they are forbidden on Shabbat, such as cooking and carrying in a public domain. From this we understand that the holiness of a Yom Tov is an intermediate level, between the holiness of Shabbat and a regular week day. 7 See Exodus 31:14, 15. See Zohar Emor 95a. See also Pri Etz Chaim ( Shaar Mikra Kodesh ) Shaar 20, Chapter 1. 8 As mentioned in chapter 6, Shabbat is called Kodesh , which means “Holy” and “Separate”. That is, just like the quality of Chochmah, it is a thing unto itself, and is removed from the mundane. On Shabb at one does not interact with the world, but rather, it is a day for interaction with G -d. Furthermore, it says in regard to Shabbat , “You shall call Shabbat pleasure”. This is to say that the inner light of Shabbat is the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Yomin (Pleasure) . 9 T his is the reason for the statement , 10 “ And y ou shall call the Shabbat pleasure ” , 11 as explained elsewhere 12 at length regarding the matter of the three meals of Shabbat .) Yom Tov, however, is referred to as , 13 “ Mikra Kodesh – It is called Holy ”, 14 [which is] an aspect of joy, as stated, 15 “ The mother of the children rejoice s ”. 16 [The “mother”] refers to the aspect of the brains of Imma [Comprehension ] which receives from Abba [Insight ], 17 because the cessation 18 [fr om work] of Shabbat is also with in Chochmah . That is to say, it is the inner       pleasure ( Atik ) into G -dliness. Likewise, as explained in the previous chapter, the inner light of the faculty of Chochmah – Insight, is the hidden pleasure and sublimation which one derives from understanding of the subject of one’s pursuit. As explained in the previous chapter, it i s specifically the pleasure and sublimation to the subject, which is the source of insight into it. If this pleasure and sublimation is lacking, there can be no Chochmah - Insight. This, then, is the relationship between the sublimation and pleasure of Shabbat and that of Chochmah , as will soon be further explained. (In contrast, in regard to Yom Tov – the Holidays, it states, “You shall be joyful on your holidays”. Furthermore, on Yom Tov one is permitted to do various types of labor and interaction wi th the world, such as cooking etc. We therefore understand the relationship between Binah , which (as explained in chapter 6) is the aspect of Joy, and Yom Tov .) 9 As explained at length in the previous chapter (and in the previous footnote), the inner lig ht of Chochmah – Insight, is the “hidden pleasure”, wherein one is so invested into the concept that he loses all awareness of himself. This is to say that the inner light and source of insight is specifically the pleasure, which is Atik Yomin , to which Chochmah is sublimated. This, then, is the meaning of the statement that “the inner light of Abba (Insight) is the innerness of Atik Yomin (pleasure).” 10 Isaiah 58:13 11 This is to say that although Shabbat (or Chochmah ) is not the actual “delight” and “pl easure” of Atik Yomin itself, nonetheless, since Atik Yomin is it’s inner light to which it is sublimated, it is called after it. 12 See commentary in the Siddur by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (The Alter Rebbe) , Seder Seudah Shelishit , page 204c. 13 Exodus 12:16; Leviticus 23:4 14 In other words, just as Chochmah is only called “pleasure” because it receives and is sublimated to the “pleasure” of Atik Yomin , so too, Binah ( Yom Tov ) is only called “Holy”, because it receives and is sublimated to the “Holiness” of Chochmah ( Shabbat ). 15 Psalms 113:9 16 That is, as opposed to the pleasure of Chochmah which is an inner bliss and sublimation that is not tangibly felt, Binah is the spreading forth of this pleasure in a way of a felt and expressed joy. As explained in chapter 6 at length, this joy comes about as a result of the comprehension of Binah . 17 The inner aspect of Binah is the depth of the comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ). This is the intangible flash of inspiration and insight which flashes from Chochmah into th e comprehending mind of Binah . Th e grasp of this essential point and depth of the comprehension is the sublimation of the mind of Binah – Comprehension, to the intangible point and flash from the mind of Chochmah – Insight . It is here, in the depth of th e comprehending mind of Binah , where the “something ness ” of Binah becomes sublimated to the “nothing ness ” of Chochmah . This means that th e aspect of the “sublimation” ( Koach Mah ) of Chochmah is also found in Binah . This is because in order for the compreh ending mind of Binah to be able to receive insight, it must be sublimated to the mind of Chochmah . (This sublimation is called, “the sublimation of the “something ness ” to the “nothing ness ”.) Now, it is specifically the “cessation from work” of the day of Shabbat ( Chochmah ) which makes it “Holy” by separating it and removing it from the “days of the week”. This cessation is the aspect of the sublimation of Chochmah to that which is above it (i.e. the pleasure of Atik Yomin ). Likewise, because the inner a spect of Binah (which is the depth and point of the comprehension) is sublimated to Chochmah , which is above it, therefore Yom Tov (i.e. Binah ) is also called “ Kodesh - Holy” , even though the actual holiness itself is in Chochmah ( Shabbat ). 18 As explained in the previous footnote, the cessation from work on Shabbat represents the aspect of the sublimation ( Bitul ) of Chochmah to Atik Yomin ."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"aspect of Abba , which is the aspect of the “ Koach Mah – The Potential Power of What” . 19 [This is] the “[intangible] nothingness” of Chochmah , before it spreads forth to become a “[tangible] something” with in the comprehension of Binah . Similarly, Binah, in its inner aspect, is the depth of the comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ), 20 for, as is known, there is the “nothingness” of Chochmah within Binah , and there is [the somethingness of] Binah within Chochmah . 21 This is the meaning of [the statement], 22 “Be unde rstanding in wisdom and wise in understanding” , which [refers to] the aspect of the inner unification of Abba and Imma . 23 This is not the case, 24 however, with the external flow of the influence of Chochmah and Binah , i.e. their ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y etc , such as the emotional [ sefirot ] of Chochmah which are called the aspect of the six directions of Abba 25 . For example [this is] the [quality of] Chessed of Chochmah (Kindness of Insight) , which is the intellectual power t hat leans towards   19 As mentioned previously, the “ Koach Mah – The Potential Power of What” is a rearrangement of the letters of the word Chochmah . This Koach Mah represents the aspect of sublimation ( Bitul ), as in Moshe’s statement, “ V’Nachnoo Mah - and what are we?” 20 That is to say, just as the inner aspect of Chochmah is the aspect of the sublimation to “the potential power to conceptual ize” ( Koach HaMaskeel ) and the “hidden pleasure”, so too the inner aspect of Binah is the “ Omek HaMoosag – the intangible depth of comprehension” which is the sublimation to Chochmah – Insight. 21 In other words, Chochmah is termed “nothing” while Binah is termed “something”. However, Chochmah also possesses the aspect of “something”, and similarly, Binah also possesses the aspect of “nothing”. It is the “something of the nothing” of Chochmah which flashes into Binah to become the “nothing of the something ”. In other words, it is the tangible aspect of Chochmah which becomes the depth and the intangible point of Binah comprehension. This is the flash of insight from the “something of the nothing” to become the “nothing of the something” where the two inte llectual powers of Chochmah and Binah meet, and become united. (This inner unification is caused specifically through Hitbonenut – contemplation and analysis, for this is the only way to reach the Omek HaMoosag - “ The intangible depth of the comprehension”, as explained at length in chapter one. It should also be noted that the process of Hitbonenut – Contemplation, which is analysis with the desire to understand, is termed “ Ha’ala’at Mayim Nukvin – The rising of the feminine waters”. That is, it is an arou sal from below, which brings about an arousal and spreading forth of influence from above, which is termed, “ Hamshachat Mayim D’churin – The drawing down of the masculine waters”.) 22 Sefer Yetzirah chapter one, mishnah 4. 23 In other words, through Hitbonen ut- Contemplation a person causes a unification of the “something of the nothing” with the “nothing of the something”. This is to say that he causes a unification of the “tangible of the intangible” with the “intangible of the tangible”. This is the innerm ost unification of the faculties of Chochmah and Binah (Insight and Comprehension), and their sublimation to that which is above them, to the very essence (i.e. the inner aspect of Atik Yomin – the pleasure). Similarly, when this inner unification of Abba and Imma of Atzilut takes place, all the worlds, both the upper worlds and the lower worlds, become completely sublimated to and one with the very essence of Atik Yomin , which, in turn, is literally bound up with the Essence of G -d ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), as previously explained. 24 All of the above was an explanation regarding the inner unification of Chochmah and Binah , which is caused through the act of trying to understand the essential truth of G -d and his relationship to His world. That is, he has a g reat desire to comprehend “what it is” and “how it is” etc. For example, in the inner unification of Abba and Imma, one is simply trying to understand the nature of the “Truth of reality”. This is not the case, however, in regard to the external unificat ion of Abba and Imma , i.e. in their lower emotional sefirot . There, in the external level, one is not investigating the simple “Truth of reality”, but rather, he accepts certain “truths” as being axiomatic and takes them for granted. Rather, his contempla tion is only into “how to feel” or “how to act” in accordance to his preconceived notions of “reality”. The external unifications of the emotional sefirot of Chochmah and Binah will now be discussed at greater length. 25 The six directions of Abba ( Vav Ki tzvin D’Abba ) refers to the three emotions, Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet and the three gut emotions, Netzach, Hod Yesod, of Insight."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"kindness, or the different intellectual power [of Gevurah ] which leans towards judgment. These [in turn ] radiate within Chessed and Gevurah of Binah (Kindness and Sternness o f Comprehension). That is, it comes into comprehension, with sound reasoning and explanation either for merit or liability . These are called the emotions of the comprehended intellect, before the y are born as actual [heartfelt emotions] in and of themselves (as will be explained). 26 Now, when a person cannot find a reason in a [way of] comprehendible explanation [for his position], but is , nonetheless , incapable of conceding to the opposite [position], because of his intellectual leaning s, this is an aspect of Chessed and Gevurah of Abba (Kindness and Sternness of Insight) , [as it is] before it radiates from the “ nothing ness ” [of Chochmah - Insight] into the “something ness ” of Binah – Comprehension . 27 (An Example of this is the matter of [the Talmudic 28 incident in which] “Rav kept silent etc”. 29 ) ([However, the statements, 30 ] “Silence is a protective fence for wisdom” or 31 “[ If speech is worth one Selah 32 , then] silence is worth two”, refer to the sublimation of the “ Koach Mah – The Potential Power of What” of Chochmah which ascends to the s ource from which all wisdom comes , and brings out new insights from there. 33 This [source] is called “ Chochmah Stima’ah – The Hidden Wisdom”, as previously explained.)   26 As will be explained in a moment, the emotions of Chessed and Gevurah of Chochmah are the emotional leanings towards eit her kindness or sternness before they have spread forth into the comprehension and reasoning of Binah . That is, he cannot yet explain why this is his leaning and opinion, but, nonetheless, this is how he sees things. These emotions of Chessed and Gevurah of Chochmah then radiate into the emotional sefirot of Chessed and Gevurah of Binah , which produces the tangible reasoning and explanations for why this is his intellectual position. However, all of the above is still totally within the intellect, and is not at all a heartfelt arousal of emotion. This level of the intellect, relative to the previous level, may be compared to the difference between the intellectual debates of the Talmud (i.e. positive and negative intellectual positions in regard to what t he emotional leaning should be towards any given issue), as opposed to the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut, which are called, Chochmat HaEmet - “The Wisdom of True Reality”. In Kabbalah and Chassidut the intellect is involved in understanding the true nature of reality, as opposed to how to act or how to feel about it. 27 That is, he has an intellectual Chochmah leaning towards kindness or sternness, but as of yet, it is still higher than the comprehending mind of Binah . He can therefore not explain his r easoning for this position. Rather, he intuitively “sees” or “senses” that it is this way. (It is clear that as opposed to the previous inner level of the intellect which receives influence from the Mazalot of Arich Anpin (and higher), this level of inte llect receives its influence from the “Arms”, i.e. Chessed and Gevurah of Arich Anpin .) 28 See Tractate Betza 6a. 29 This refers to a Talmudic incident in which Rav was challenged on the logic of his position and remained silent. He did not concede to the o pposing position, but neither did he argue against it. Instead he remained silent. This is because he intuitively “knew” that he was correct in a way of Chochmah rather than in a way of Binah . On the level of Chochmah – Insight, he “sensed” that his posit ion was correct, but he hadn’t yet brought it down to a comprehendible explanation on the Binah level. 30 See Avot , Chapter 3, Mishnah 13. 31 See Tractate Megilla 18a. 32 A Selah was an ancient monetary currency used during Talmudic times. 33 In this parenthes is, the Rebbe is pointing out the difference between the inner silence and sublimation that relates to the inner unification of Chochmah and Binah , as opposed to the “silence of Rav” which was mentioned immediately before this parenthesis. The silence ref erred to here may be understood as follows: When a person is involved in the contemplation of a subject, in trying to understand it clearly to its very depth, obviously there is something which he does not yet understand. This is specifically why he is contemplating and analyzing the matter. When he contemplates it deeply, until he literally reaches the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" Now, the aspect of NeHi”Y of Chochmah (The gut emotions of Insight) is the aspect of th e “ scales ” of intellect and insight , as to how this intellectual matter should come to be expressed . This is the aspect of “the kidneys which give counsel”. 34 (This is the matter of the strength of the intellect, which is called , “Strong M inded ness”. Just as the legs have the strength to uphold the entire body, so too, the aspect s of Netzach and Hod 35 of Abba uphold the “ body ” of the mind. The reverse is true if he is not strong m inded . H e will easily fall [and retreat ] from his logical reasoning, [and chan ge his stan ce] from [judging something as be ing ] liable to [being] meritorious , or from impure to pure etc. The same principle applies to Netzach and Hod of Imma .) 36 In general, the brains of Zeir Anpin , which are [heartfelt] emotions that are below intel lect (as will be explained), come about from th e en clothement of the aspect of the NeHi”Y of Abba into the NeHi”Y of Imma . 37       “ceiling” of his intellect, then immediately before any flash of insight comes into his mind, there is an inner “silence” in his mind. This “silence” is the same sublimation ( Bitul ) and “hidden pleasure” of the inner aspect of Chochmah and Binah which was explained previously. It is this “silence of the mind” which precedes any flash of insight or intuition into the subject. However, the inner silence o f the mind mentioned here is different than the silence mentioned in the previous example of Rav being silent. In that example, that was only an external silence, which stemmed from the intellectual leaning of the emotional sefirot of Chochmah , as opposed to the inner sublimation of the Koach Mah - The Potential Power of What. He was silent simply because he did not know how to respond to the challenge rather that because of trying to understand the inner truth of the matter. This is because he had already determined his position on the matter. 34 The matter of the “kidneys which council” has already been mentioned in chapter 21. Also see next footnote. 35 Netzach and Hod have two general functions. In their function of deciding whether the influence will come out positively or negatively, Netzach and Hod are referred to as the kidneys and in their function of upholding that decision through strong mindedness, they are referred to as the legs (or thighs). 36 As explained in previous chapters, the aspect of Net zach, Hod and Yesod is the intellectual scale, which measures how the predetermined influence of Chessed and Gevurah (and above) should be brought out, either to the recipient or to the heartfelt emotions which are below the intellect etc. Since these are the intellectual sefirot of NeHi”Y , this can be seen as the intellectual determination of how one should act in any given situation based upon the predetermined intellectual leanings of Chessed and Gevurah of the intellect. That is to say, when one encou nters any circumstance, it is not necessary for him to go through the entire logic of his position each time the matter comes up. Rather, he has already determined his position on the subject, and all he must do now is adapt it to this particular situatio n. Netzach and Hod are sometimes also referred to as the “two legs” (see Patach Eliyahu ). Likewise, the aspects of Netzach and Hod of the intellect are the “legs” which uphold the “body” of the intellect. In other words, this is the strength of mind in one’s intellectual position. We find that there are two aspects in the matter of NeHi”Y of the intellect. There is the matter of the spreading forth of the influence below, and there is the matter of the strength of mind in one’s intellectual position. Now, these two explanations of the aspect of Netzach and Hod are not in conflict, but rather, they are interdependent. It is because of his strength of mind in his position that he will be able to bring this influence forth, into heartfelt emotions, actio n, or to a recipient. For example, if he does not have a strong position in a certain matter, it is certain that his emotions will not become aroused towards an opposing opinion. On the contrary, his position will falter and he will retreat in the face o f any opposition. From this we see that these two matters are interdependent, and are part and parcel of the same faculty. (This will be understood even more clearly from the next paragraph of the text, and its explanation.) 37 In other words, usually, on e’s emotions become aroused only by the most external level of his intellect, which is the unification NeHi”Y of Abba and Imma . Moreover, even one’s actions are generally only from this most external level of the intellect. Most of the time a person is n ot contemplating the “Truth of"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" Now, the particular matters of the unifications of Abba and Imma are well known. [This refers to] whether [the ir unification] is i n th eir inner aspect, for their own purpose, which is the [unification] of their first three [ sefirot ] before they spread forth into the emotional [ sefirot ], or whether they unify to bring about new “brains” for Zeir Anpin and Nukvah , which is only [the external unification of ] NeHi” Y . The [difference between these two unifications] is the [same as the] difference between Shabbat and the weekdays. 38       Reality” or attempting to understand what is really going on, i.e. how or why we are here etc. Rather, he already holds strong opinions which he feels are self evident ( NeHi”Y of Abba and Imma ) regarding the nature of his e xistence (which usually did not originate with him, but are rather learned opinions which he accepted from others), and he conducts himself accordingly. However, because the influence to the emotions and actions comes about only from the most external le vel of the intellect, it therefore lacks the vitality of the pleasure, sublimation, and complete self -investment which do take place when he invests the inner levels of the intellect (as explained above). Because of this lack of sublimation and self -inves tment, most people go through life by rote. It is as if they are just “going through the motions”, completely on automatic, with almost no inner life and vitality. Because man below usually conducts himself in this fashion, even when studying Torah or ful filling the commandments of G -d, so too, G -d responds in kind, and therefore, generally, all the worlds, both the upper and the lower worlds, are created only through this type of influence, from a unification of the externality of NeHi”Y of Abba and Imma . This is to say that there is a constant unification the NeHi”Y of Abba with the NeHi”Y of Imma, which gives vitality to the world, but only in an external way, like a person who does something by rote, but whose mind and self is really invested elsewhere . (This is explains the statement that Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension) are “Two lovers who never separate”. On this external level they are constantly unified, for otherwise all the worlds would not continue to exist. At least this level of unif ication of Chochmah and Binah is necessary to maintain the existence of the world. However, this is a most external issuance of vitality, as explained above. In the inner levels of Abba and Imma , however, it is possible for them to be separated. This typ e of external unification and influence is referred to as “ Chol – the weekday”, in contrast to the inner unification and influence of Shabbat and Yom Tov , as explained above.) The above will now be further explained. 38 The difference between these two ty pes of unification, the inner and the external, was explained in the previous footnote, and may be further understood as follows: The inner unification of Chochmah with Binah is considered to be a unification “for themselves”, because, here the desire is solely to understand the “Truth of Reality”, which is the reality of G -d. As explained before, this unification is brought about specifically through Hitbonenut – Contemplation and Analysis, and even more specifically, this is the study and intellectual t oil of Chassidut and Kabbalah. Now, this analysis and contemplation is what causes a unification of Chochmah and Binah , thus instigating a flash of insight into “Reality”, and a glimpse into the truth of G - d’s existence. As mentioned previously (in chapt er 5), this “vision” with the mind’s eye is what is called, L’Eestakla B’Yeekra D’Malka - “Gazing at the preciousness of the King”. The only way this intellectual seeing may be attained is through Hitbonenut - Contemplation of Torah, (since Torah is the Divine body of knowledge), and specifically through Hitbonenut – Contemplation into the inner aspect of the Torah (which is Kabbalah and Chassidut). However, the actual source and cause of this flash of insight into the reality of G -d, is specifically the “hidden pleasure” and the complete sublimation and investment of himself, to the point where he is not even aware of himself. The reason he is not aware of himself is because he is so completely invested into his perception and awareness of G -d, and altho ugh he will have a powerful arousal of emotions of love and awe of G -d, he will, nonetheless, be totally unaware of it. This is because his emotions are totally bound up with, and completely sublimated to the flash of insight into reality and awareness of G-d. Moreover, because of his awareness of the reality of G - d’s presence, he will be greatly motivated with great enthusiasm and vitality to fulfill G - d’s commandments (The Mitzvot ) . This level of unification with G -d is called Shabbat . This is because Shabbat is a day which is “Holy” and separated from all mundane matters, as explained above, and is totally bound up to G -d. Now, when man, below, activates this inner unification and sublimation of Chochmah and Binah through Hitbonenut - contemplation, t his causes an inner unification of Abba and Imma of Atzilut , the sublimation to G -d and the awareness of His presence in all the worlds, both the upper worlds and the lower worlds. The ultimate"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" (In the Shma recital, the [inner] intention of [the words ] “ Ha shem Elokeinu - HaShem our G -d ” is the inner [un ification] of Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension) , from which [it follows that] “ Hashem is One”, [which refers to] the unification of Zeir Anpin and Nukvah (Emotions and Speech [or actions]) as they receive an aspect of additional influe nce of new intellect so that they may be able to give birth etc. 39 This is [brought about] by giving       realization of this will take place with the revelation of Mo shiach and finally, in HaOlam HaBah - “The World to Come”, which is called, Yom SheKoolo Shabbat - “A day which is all Shabbat ”. This will come about in the seventh millennium. The above explains the inner unification of Abba and Imma , in their upper thre e sefirot . In contrast, the external unification of Abba and Imma is only in the aspect of NeHi”Y . Here, the person is not contemplating the truth of reality, and is not necessarily contemplating anything at all. Rather, he has certain preconceived noti ons of reality (which he did not necessarily arrive at through his own contemplation and understanding), and he conducts his life according to these preconceived notions. Although these notions may also include “G - d” in them, nonetheless, since there is n o sublimation to G -d or self - investment and “hidden pleasure” into Him, all of which come about through Hitbonenut - contemplation, the person therefore conducts himself in an external fashion, with very little vitality or true enthusiasm, even when he is serving G - d. This is because he has no “insight” or “perception” of G -d presence or the truth of G - d’s reality. He will therefore have little to no sublimation to G -d, and if he does have any, it will only be external. Because of this, even if he does pe rform G - d’s commandments, he will lack the self -investment and sublimation to G -d, and therefore, he will be entirely aware of himself, and will certainly not be bound up with G - d or aware of His absolute singularity. (Even if he “hypes” himself up in ord er to induce an arousal of emotions toward G -d, this will actually only create a more heightened awareness of himself. This is because, as explained in chapter 5, if there is a lacking in the contemplation and comprehension, then there certainly will be a lacking in the sublimation, as well.) It follows, that when man below conducts himself in this fashion, with only an external unification of Chochmah and Binah , then likewise above, the worlds will be conducted and created by G -d in a similar fashion, me asure for measure. In other words, there will only be an external unification of NeHi”Y of Abba and Imma of Atzilut , just to maintain the existence of the world. However, because the sublimation of all the worlds to the Essence of G-d ( Atzmoot Ein Sof ) i s lacking, and G -d only investments Himself into all the worlds in an external fashion, therefore, the worlds and all the entities therein, perceive themselves as separate entities, separate and apart from G - d. This type of reality is referred to as “ Chol – the weekday”. (These are the six millennia of the world, which precede the aforementioned seventh millennium of Shabbat and are also called HaOlam HaZeh – This World. ) 39 In the Shema recital, the words “ Havayah Elokeinu – HaShem our G - d” refers to the unification of Chochmah and Binah , i.e. the inner contemplation of the reality of G - d’s existence. If one contemplates this in a manner in which he gives himself over to G -d with complete self -sacrifice and self investment, then he will grasp its inner de pth and point. As previously explained, this grasp is called, L’Eestakla B’Yeekra D’Malka - “Gazing at the preciousness of the King”. As explained in the beginning chapters of the book, the automatic outcome of this is that his entire being, including hi s emotions and actions, become sublimated and included in the Oneness of G -d. (This refers to the various levels of love of G -d and awe of G-d which are aroused through Hitbonenut – Contemplation into G - d’s unity.) This, then, is the meaning of the conti nuation of the verse, “ Havayah Echad – HaShem is One”. That is, his entire being (and the being all of the worlds) becomes bound up and sublimated to G - d’s Essential singularity and unity. This also is the meaning of the statement said in our prayers, “F or the sake of unifying the Yud -Heh (of G - d’s name) with the Vav -Heh (of His name) etc.” On a more general level, as explained in previous footnotes, this contemplation causes the presence of G -d to be revealed in all worlds, both the upper worlds and the lower worlds, thereby bringing about the complete sublimation of all the worlds to G -d. Also, the Rebbe points out here that this is specifically due to giving ourselves over to G -d with complete self -sacrifice, i.e. the complete self -investment into the comprehension of G - d’s unity. Without this self -investment, which is the “hidden pleasure” in G - d, with great desire, to the point where one’s entire being is involved in it, there can be no insight into this reality. It is therefore specifically due to complete self -sacrifice and self - investment that one can attain a true realization and awareness of the unity of G - d. (The emotions of “You shall love HaShem etc.”, which is this verse which immediately follows, come about as an automatic result of the above contemplation and realization.)"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"ourselves over to G -d with complete self -sacrifice during the Shma recital. In contrast, when [one studies] Torah and [performs] the commandments without self -sacrific e, then Zeir Anpin and Nukvah (Emotions and Speech [or Action]) only [receive] from an external unification of Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension), as explained elsewhere. 40 An example [of the inner unification] is the matter of the ten martyrs 41 wh o brought about an ascent of the “Feminine W aters - Mayim Nukvin ” to the inner aspect of Abba and Imma, specifically through giving their [actual] lives over to G -d with complete self -sacrifice. 42 ) (This [also] is the matter of the unification of the “upper Ab ba and Imma ”, and the unification of the “lower Abba and Imma ”, which is Yisrael Saba and Tvunah , as was explained at length before in regard to the matter of Binah and Tvunah . 43 The aspect of Yisrael Saba is the six directions of Abba 44 , and Tvunah is the six directions of Imma . 45 46 These [two] are called “T he lower Abba and Imma ”. [H ow ever] , there is another Yisrael Saba which is even higher than the “upper Abba and Imma ”. This is the six directions of the “Hidden Chochmah ” of Arich Anpin and [the higher] Tvunah is the six directions of Binah of Arich Anpin . 47 The source for the inner unification of the “upper Abba and Imma ”, in volving their first three [ sefirot , as explained above ], is drawn from the [ unification of the higher Yisrael Saba and Tvunah of Arich Anpin ]. 48 )   40 This has already been explained at length in footnotes 37 and 38 of this chapter. 41 This refers to the ten great Sages who were cruelly tortured and murdered at the hands of the Romans because they continued to teac h Torah even after the Romans had outlawed it. 42 As mentioned in chapter 15, the feminine waters – Mayim Nukvin , represent an arousal and flow of influence from below to above, from the recipient to the Giver of Divine influence. As noted in footnote 21, the process of Hitbonenut – Contemplation, which is analysis with a great desire to understand, is termed “ Ha’ala’at Mayim Nukvin – The rising up of the feminine waters”. In other words, this is an arousal from below, which causes an arousal and spreading forth of influence from G -d above, which is called, “ Hamshachat Mayim D’churin –The drawing down of the masculine waters”. However, as explained, this “arousal from below” must be done with complete self - investment and “hidden pleasure” in order for the reciprocal influence from above to below to come about. All the above is true not only in the contemplative sense, but in the practical sense as well, in regard to the complete self -investment and self - sacrifice in the fulfillment of the G - d’s commandment s. It is explained in Kabbalah and Chassidut that through giving themselves over to G -d with complete self -sacrifice, to the point of death, these ten Martyrs caused enough influence to be drawn down into the world to sustain it until the time of the fina l redemption, with the coming of Moshiach, may it be speedily in our days, Amen. 43 This has been explained at length in chapter two (and three). 44 This is referring to the three emotions ( Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet ) and the three gut emotions ( Netzach, Ho d, Yesod ) of the insight - Chochmah. 45 This is referring to the three emotions ( Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet ) and the three gut emotions ( Netzach, Hod, Yesod ) of the comprehension - Binah. 46 Tvunah is the spreading forth of the light of Binah , while Yisrael Saba is the spreading forth of the light of Chochmah, in order to bring out the depth of the light of the intellect to that which is below the intellect, either to the heartfelt emotions, or into practical application. 47 See HaGahot Tzemach on Etz Chaim , ( Drush Igullim V’Yosher ) Shaar 1, Anaf 5. This will also be discussed later on in chapter 34. 48 This refers to the spreading forth of the light of the Mazalot of Arich Anpin , which was previously explained. The upper Yisrael Saba is the spreading forth of the light of Chochmah of Arich Anpin , while the upper Tvunah is the spreading forth of the light of Binah of Arich Anpin . As explained in the previous chapter, the inner unification of Abba and Imma is caused by the unification of the two Mazalot in their source."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Now, when intellect is drawn down from Abba and Imma to Zeir Anpin and Nukvah in order to give birth to souls, it is then necessary for the unification of Abba and Imma to be in the inner intellect, in their root with in the two Mazalot of Arich Anpin . 49 (This, then, is the meaning of [the statement 50 ], “C hildren, [health, and livelihood] are dependant upon Mazal ”) . 51 This is a s explained elsewhere, that this is the [inner] meaning of [the prayer, 52 “ The Supernal G-d, who bestows good kindnes ses, the possessor of all , who remembers the kindness es of the fathers and brings a redeemer to their children’s children etc. ”] The “Super nal G - d” refers to the ascent of the inner light of Abba (Insight) as it receives from the Mazal of “ Notzer ” 53 . Then, [the result of this is that ] “He bestows good kindnesses” through the aspect of Yesod , 54 which is called “T he Possessor of all ”, 55 to give birth to offspring through [the resulting unification of] Zeir Anpin and Nukvah . 56 This, then, is the meaning of the   49 In other words, new souls are brought forth into the worlds through the unification of Abba and Imma of Atzilut . However, in order to bring forth a new soul, it is necessary that there be an inner unification of Abba and Imma , with the sublimation and pleasure of Arich Anpin and Atik Yomin . This is because the souls are a “ Chelek Eloka MeeMa’al Mamash – Literally a Part of G - d from above”, and are literally from the Essence of G -d Himself. They must therefore issue forth from the Essence ( Atzmoot ). As explained in chapter twenty four, it is the pleasure ( Atik Yomin ) which draws out the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). Therefore, in order for there to be an issuance of influence from the Essence, it is necessary for there to be additional influence of pleasure and desire, as explained previously. This may be clearly understood from the conception of a new human being in this world. In order for a child (i.e. a new soul) to be born, it is necessary for there to be an inner unif ication of Abba (Father) and Imma (Mother). Moreover, in order for the seminal drop to issue forth, the essential self of the person must be invested into it. This is drawn out through the great pleasure. This, then, is the meaning of the above statement that in order to give birth to souls, it is necessary for there to be a unification of Abba and Imma in the inner intellect, in their root within the two Mazalot of Arich Anpin . (Another way that this may be understood is that in order for there to be “S oul” in one’s Divine service, or in order to bring forth and reveal deeper levels of one’s soul in an inner way, there must be an inner unification of Abba and Imma (Insight and Comprehension), which is brought about through Hitbonenut – Contemplation.) F rom all of the above it is apparent that although the actual influence and birth of souls in the world comes about through the aspects of Netzach, Hod and specifically Yesod , nonetheless the real source of this influence is actually from a higher level. It s real source is from the inner unification of Abba and Imma , which draws out influence from the very Essence of G -d Himself ( Atzmoot Ein Sof ). 50 See Tractate Moed Katan 28a. 51 That is, they are dependant upon the inner unification of Abba and Imma as they receive from their source in the Mazalot of Arich Anpin – the desire, (and even higher, in Atik Yomin – the pleasure). 52 See beginning of Amidah prayer. See also Pri Etz Chaim ( Shaar Ha’Amidah ), Shaar 9, Chapter 3. 53 The name E-L is an appellation for Ch ochmah. Therefore E-L Elyon (The Supernal G -d) refers to the inner light of Chochmah -Insight as it ascends to receive from the Mazal of Notzer of Arich -Desire. 54 As mentioned in the previous chapter, and as will be explained later, Yesod is called “good” a nd is an aspect of kindness, since it is the aspect of the bestowal of influence to the recipient. 55 As will be explained later, Yesod is also called “ Kol – All”, since everything (i.e. all the preceding lights) gather in Yesod in order to spread forth as influence to the recipient. 56 That is to say, the birth of souls physically (and spiritually in one’s Divine service) must be spawned through the inner unification of the intellectual sefirot of Chochmah and Binah , and their sublimation to their source, wh ich are the Mazalot of Arich Anpin . This is the perceptual awareness and revelation of the presence of the “Supernal G - d”. It is only then that this essential light may be drawn forth through the influence of Yesod, to bring out new G -dly light into the created worlds."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"continuation of the verse, “He remembers the kindness es of the fathers and brings the redeemer to their children’s children”. 57 The analogy for this is well known. It is similar a person who is particularly outstanding in his [deep] insight [and wi sdom] . Si nce he knows the concept to its depth, specifically to the very source of its inception , he is therefore capable of [bringing out] influence from it to some one who is of a much lesser [intellectual capacity than himself ], even to a small child. [This is t o say that ] he can make new combinations [to explain ] how to conceptualize this concept, specifically not merely [ explain ing it] as it [already] is [in his own mind] . Furthermore, he is capable of formulating and giving rise to entirely new and different concepts , through this concept . 58 However, such is not the case in regard to one who is not so exceptionally wise and who grasps the concept and wisdom merely as it is . 59 It is [difficult] enough for him to make the “ break through ” and grasp it him self. H owever, he will be incapable of “giving birth” to new insights from it, altogether. C ertain ly, he will be incapable of lowering it and “bringing down ” the explanation of the concept so that [even] a child could understand it. 60 [From all the above] we find that the aspect of NeHi”Y of Chochmah (The gut emotions of Insight) , which is the aspect of Yesod , i.e. the power to influence a recipient, is specifically   57 The “Fathers” refers to Abba ( Chochmah ) and to its sublimation and perception of the inner light of the Essence of the “Supernal G - d”, (i.e. the Mazalot of Arich Anpin (desire) and Atik Yomin (pleasure) within which Atmoot Ohr Ein Sof – The Essence of the Infinite Light of G -d is vested. It is only through this level of self -sacrifice (i.e. self -investment) and pleasure into the Divine service that there can be awareness of the “Supernal G - d”. It is specifically through the toil of Hitbo nenut - contemplation (in Chassidus and Kabbalah) that this inner sublimation to G -d is aroused, thereby eliciting an arousal from above, which brings about a flash of insightful revelation of G - d’s presence in the world. This, then, is the meaning of the continuation of the prayer, “and brings the redeemer to their children’s children”. In other words, the redemption is entirely dependant on everything that was explained above. This is because the entire matter of the redemption is specifically the reve lation of G -d within the world , and, as explained, this revelation is dependant upon the toil of Hitbonenut - contemplation in Chassidus and Kabbalah. 58 As explained in chapter two, all of the above is only possible because of his firm grasp and “sight” in to the intangible essential truth of the concept ( Omek Hamoosag ), and his sublimation to it. It is because he grasps the essential depth and the Heyulie point of it, that he is capable of drawing out all manner of different explanations and insights from this depth. Similarly, when one has a good grasp and “sight” of the essential G -dliness of the concepts of Chassidut and Kabbalah in his mind, he will be capable of bringing it out into his emotions, his actions, and into the world at large. That is, he will be a man of Tvunah who is capable of drawing out the very depths themselves into revelation, as explained in chapter two. (As mentioned previously, this sublimation to the essential G -dliness in the Divine body of knowledge is called the “ Choosh HaCh assidut – The Sense of the Chassidut”, i.e. the perceptual sight of the intangible essence of G -d.) 59 In other words, he does not grasp the depth and essential point of the concept, but only the external explanations of it, rather than its inner light. He will therefore only be capable of repeating the explanations as he received them, but he will not be capable of drawing out new light from the Heyulie depth of the concept. Moreover, as explained in chapters two and three, because he does not have this inner sublimation and perception of the intangible essence, his emotions will not become aroused in his Divine Service, and he will be incapable of bringing the concepts out into revelation. (On the contrary, as mentioned previously, he will question the n eed of this type of study altogether etc, because it all remains completely abstract to him.) 60 Refer back to chapters two and three."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"dependant upon the potential power to conceptualize ( Ko’ach HaMaskeel ), which is the source from wh ich all concept s are “ hewn ” from “nothing” to “something”. 61 This is likewise so in regard to the birth of souls from the aspect of NeHi”Y . [The aspect of NeHi”Y ] cannot give birth [to new souls] unless there is additional [influence of] strength in the s ource of its intellect, from a much higher level than intellect. T his the reason that for there to be a birth of souls through the unification of Abba and Imma , there must be [influence] from higher than the source of the intellect of Abba and Imma . This is the aspect of the Mazalot of the “Hidden Wisdom” ( Chochmah Steema’a ) which is even higher than Chochmah and Binah of Arich Anpin itself, as previously explained. 62 This is also the reason for the inner unification of Abba and Imma during the night of t he “Holy Shabbat ( Shabbat Kodesh )”. T his is because [this unification] is to give birth to s ouls. This is, therefore, specifically the time for the “ marital relations of the Sages”. 63 This is because they are Torah Scholars who are called “ Kodesh – Holy” and the source of Shabbat is in the “upper Kodesh –Holiness”, which is the inner aspect of the light of Abba , as previously explained. This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Twenty Six   61 This is to say that in order to draw out an entirely new issuance of influence to the recipient (or into the worlds), it is necessary for there to be an inner unification of Abba and Imma , in which the intellect becomes bound up to the potential power of conceptualize of Arich Anpin itself. In other words, it is necessary for there to be a flash of insight and perception o f the essential Heyulie depth of the concept. This only happens when there is sublimation and complete self - investment, in the way of a “hidden pleasure” into the subject. Without this, it is impossible to draw out new insights or explanations. Similarly , above in G -dliness, for there to be an entirely new influence, which is the perception and revelation of G -dliness in the worlds, there must be an inner unification of Abba and Imma , wherein the worlds become sublimated and bound to the essential G -dline ss which continuously creates and vitalizes them, and although this influence is actually revealed through the lower aspect of Yesod, nonetheless, its source is from much higher level, within the very essence of Arich Anpin and Atik Yomin , and ultimately w ithin the very Essence of the Infinite Light itself. 62 All of this has already been explained in the previous footnotes of this chapter. 63 See Introduction of Zohar 14a.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Seven Now, after having explained in a somewhat particular manner about the matte r of the lights of Abba and Imma and their internal and external unifications, as previously explained, we must now explain the specifics of the matter of the lights of Zeir Anpin , which are called Yisrael and Yaakov . 1 [Moreover, we must explain] all the particulars of the unifications of Zeir Anpin , which are [either] called a union of Yisrael and Leah or a union of Yaakov and Rachel etc, as is known. However, we must first have an introductory understand ing regarding the matter of Lights and Vessels ( Or ot V’ Kelim ), both general ly and particularly. 2 Now, the explanation of the statement, 3 [“H e and His life force are one, H e and His organs are one”], is known. [That is,] “He and His life force are one” refers to the lights ( Orot ), while “He and His organ s are one” refers to the aspect of the vessels ( Kelim ). 4 Now, both generally and particularly speaking , the aspect of the lights of the ten sefirot is called, 5 “T en sefirot without what” , i.e. without “what ness”. This is as stated, 6 “He i s not of any of these qualities altogether”. 7 It is solely because of the aspect of the vessels that they are in an aspect of a tangible existence. This is the [meaning of the] statement, 8 “He b rought forth ten vessels which we call ten sefirot ... to show... and to conduct the worlds with them etc”. 9   1 See Etz Chaim , ( Shaar HaKelipot ) Shaar 48, Chapters 2 & 3. 2 All of th e above will be explained later at great length, a fter the explanation o f Lights and Vessels ( Orot V’ Kelim ). This chapter i s an introductory chapter, in which many concepts will be introd uced, but not fully explained with their details . However, the main point of this chapter, which is to explain the general difference s betw een Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim ), will be fully explained here . 3 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b. 4 In other words , both the Lights ( Orot ) and the Vessels ( Kelim ) are totally bound with Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - the Essence of the Infinite Light, and are one with G -d. This matter will be explained in f ull in the next few chapters. However, before this may be understood , we must fully understand the explanation of Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim ). 5 See Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishnah 2. 6 See In troduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17b. 7 This is to say that the Light ( Ohr ), i.e. the essential vitality of the ten sefirot, is completely intangible. This refers to the Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - The Essence of the Infinite Light , which radiates within the Kav - Line . As explained previously, since this li ght is still entirely bound to Atzmoot Ein Sof - The Essential Singularity of G -d, it is therefore an ab solute singularity and completly intangible and indefinable. 8 See Tikkunei Zohar 17a and 17b. 9 In other words, it is specifically the Vessels ( Kelim ) which bring the Light ( Ohr ) in to a tangible state. This is to say that all tangibility comes about from th e aspect of the vessels, rather than from the aspect of the Light, which is an intangible Essence. Because of this, we cannot actually speak of sefirot in regard to"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" Likewise, the fact that, in general, the ten sefirot of Atzilut are called by four names, 10 A”V (72) , Sa”G (63) , Ma”H (45) and Ba”N (52) , [is only in regard to the aspect of the vessels]. 11 [The name] A”V 12 is an expansion [of the four letter name of G -d] with Yud’s , and refers to Chochmah . 13 [The name ] Sa”G 14 is [an expansion] with Yud’s and an Aleph , and refers to Binah . 15 [The name ] Ma”H 16 is [an expansion] with Aleph’s and refers to Zeir Anpin , 17 [and the name] Ba”N 18 is [an expans ion] with Heh’s , and refers to Malchut , as is known. 19 As is known, in the terminolog y of the Zohar , the ten general sefirot are only called, 20 “ The secret of the Holy Name”. 21 All this is specifically only in respect to the aspect of the vessels ( Kelim ), a s is known. 22       the Essential Light. Rather, e ven the mention of a definition such as “ sefirot ”, is in reference to the Vessels ( Kelim ) within which the Essential Light vests. This is the meaning of the statement o f the Zohar mentioned above, that “He bro ught forth ten vessels which we call ten sefirot ”. That is, the term “ sefirot ” may only be applied to the vessels. The Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim ) and their relationship will now be further explained. 10 The Divine names may be expanded by spelling out their individual letters as follows; Alef ( אל \" ף ), Beit ( בי \" ת ), Gimmel ( גימ \" ל ) etc. The letters Hey ( ה ) and Vav ( ו ) each have three possible spellings : HY ( ה \" י ), HA ( ה \" א ), HH ( ה \" ה ), VYV ( וי \" ו ), VAV ( וא \" ו ), VV ( ו \" ו ). The four letter name of G -d (Y-H-V-H י - ה - ו - ה ) may therefore be expanded into sever al possible spellings depending on the variant spellings of the letters Hey ( ה ) and Vav ( ו ). 11 As will soon be explained , the ten sefirot are called by certain names. These names are the vessels for the sefirot . The reason for this is because a name draw s out the essence and spreads it forth into revelation. This is understood by the fact that when one’s name is ca lled out, it draws his essential identity and attention toward the caller. Furthermore, a name is what gives description to something. This i s to say that a description is a name. Now, a name is not the actual thing itself. Rather, it brings the essence of the thing to light and defines its specific form. If someone were to go to a craftsman and tell him, “make it for me”, without defining it by name, such as make a chair for me or make a table for me, or at least describing it, the craftsman would surely not know what to make. He would simply not know what is wanted of him. Even if the person who placed the order has a clear picture in his o wn mind of what he wants, nonetheless, since no description was given, the object will never be made. It is the description of this thing, i.e. its name, which reveals it to the craftsman, and makes it possible for the object to come into actuality. Likew ise above, the names of the sefirot etc. are the descriptions which contain and bring the G -dly light into revelation and tangibility . Without the se vessels of names , descriptions and limitations , the G -dly lights could never materialize and would remain completely beyond tangibl e comprehension and definition. Now, a lthough the se names are mentioned in this chapter, their explanation will only come later in the book. 12 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar RaPa”Ch Nitzotzin ) Shaar 18, Chapter 2. 13 That is, YOD -HY -VYV -HY ( יו \" ד ה \" י וי \" ו ה \" י ), expanded with Yods .

The first Heh ( ה ) corresponds to Binah , wherein the point of Chochmah ( י ) is expanded into a"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" Now, t he explanation of the matter is known, that in regard to the statement, 23 “T here are three rulers above, the brain , the heart and the liver”, these are the three vessels for the Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshamah . 24 The Neshamah [vests] within the brain, the Ruach [vests] within the heart , and the Nefesh [vests] within the liver. 25 However, the aspects of the Chayah and Yechidah [of the soul] transcend the limitations of vessels. 26 Now, the aspect of the vessels ( Kelim ) is composed of a beginnin g, middle and end. [This is to say that] there is the inner [part] of the vessels, the middle [part ] of the vessels, and the external [part] of the vessels. [This is in accordance to] what is known regarding the matter of the “248 limbs of the King” whic h are the nine sefirot of Zeir Anpin . [That is,] nine times nine equals eighty -one . Then, three times eighty -one, corresponding to the three levels in the vessels – the beginning, middle, and end – equals two hundred and forty three. [Now, with the addi tion of] the five Kindnesses ( Chassadim ) which spawn growth, it equals two       length and width as depicted by the letter Heh ( ה ). The Vav ) ו ( whose numerical value is six corresponds to the six emotional sefirot of Zeir Anpin . The last Heh ( ה ) corresponds to the spreading forth of all of the above into action, Malchut . 22 In truth, a lthough the vessels are what give tangibility and “something ness” to the sefirot , nonetheless, tangibility and “something ness” is not actually applicable in t he e manated world o f Atzilut which is still totally infinite and intan gible. Rather, “something ness” is only applicable in the created worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . In other words , in the world of Atzilut – Emanation, even the vessels are in an aspect of intangibi lity and essential G-dliness and are in a way of “Nothingness” ( Ein ), rather than “Something ness” ( Yesh ). This, is one of the explanations of the statement , “He and His organs are one”. However, the fact that we do call them “some thing” (relative to the lights of Atzilut ) is because the vessels of Atzilut are the heyulie source for the expression and influence of actual tangibility and “something ness ”. It is therefore fitting to call them “something” in reference to the influence which issues fro m them. For example, the G -dly power and source from which the aspect of Chochmah of the world of Briyah is drawn , is fitting to be called Chakim – Wise. This is in accordance with what is known regarding the matter of “You have called them all by names”. There fore, this concept of “Names” does indeed speak of the vessels of the ten sefirot of the world of Atzilut . (That is to say, the sefirot of Atzilut are named according to the influence which is destined to issue forth from them etc. This will be more clea rly understood at the end of this chapter and the next , where it is explained that the Vessels ( Kelim ) come from the lowest level of the Light ( Ohr or Form – Tzurah ). 23 See Zohar Terumah 153a, and Toldot 138a. See also, Zohar Chadash, Ruth 80a. 24 At first, three genera l Vessels ( Kelim ) are created. These are called the three “Rulers” ( Shleetin ). This is comparable to a King who is the Ruler and representative of all the people in his land. These three “Rulers” are the Brain ( Mocha ), the Heart ( Leeba ), and the Liver ( Ka vved ). However, more particularly speaking, they are divided into nine sefirot , i.e. three level s, each of which has three levels . These are ChaBa”D – which are the intellectual sefirot of the “Brain”, ChaGa”T – which are the heartfelt emotional sefiro t of the “Heart”, and NeHi”Y – which are the gut emotional sefirot of the “Liver”. As will soon be explained , each of these sefirot also possesses nine sefirot . ( Malchut, which is the tenth sefirah is not counted with in Zeir Anpin , since it forms its own Partzuf - Stature which is called Nukvah -The Female , as will later be expla ined .) 25 The explanations of the particulars of the vessels will only be mentioned generally in this chapter, since they will be ex plained at great length later in chapter 30. The m ain point of this chapter is to explain the general difference between Lights ( Ohr ) and Vessels ( Kelim ). 26 The Chayah and Yechidah levels of the soul are called “ Ohr Makif – The Encompassing Light” of the soul, which do not vest within the Vessels ( Kelim ) of the Brain, the Heart, and the Liver. In contrast, the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah are called “ Ohr Pni mee – The Pervading Lights” of the soul which do vest within the vessels. The differences between these two will be explained in later footnotes."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"hundred and forty eight. This is the general matter of the vessels of Zeir Anpin , which are called “T he body of the King”. 27 In addit ion [to the “organs”], “He prepared garments fo r them, from which souls for human beings issue forth ”. 28 [These “garments”] are the garments of thought, [speech and action], as will all be explained. 29   27 Thi s will be explained at length in chapter 30, and will therefore only be explained in short here. The innerness of the vessels is the aspect of the containment and restriction of the light of ChaBa”D (the intellect) of that particular vessel and sefirah . The middle part of the vessel is the containment and restriction of the light of ChaGa”T (the emotions) of that particular sefirah and the external part of the vessel is the containment and restriction of light of NeHi”Y (the gut emotion) of that particula r sefirah . As mentioned in footnote 24, there are three general “ levels ” of the vessels. The first is the three intellectual sefirot of ChaBa”D – the Brain. The second is the three heartfelt emotional sefirot of ChaGa”T – the Heart. The third is the gu t emotional sefirot of NeHi”Y – the Liver. Each of these nine sefirot also possesses nine sefirot , as explained previously regarding the subdivisions of the sefirot of Tikkun . Therefore, nine times nine equals eighty one (9 x 9 = 81). Now, each of these eighty -one sefirot (and sub - sefirot ), has three parts, inner, middle and outer ( ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y ). Therefore, three times eighty -one equals two -hundred and forty -three (3 x 81 = 243). When the five kindness es , which cause these “Limbs” to gro w, are added, there are two hundred and forty eight (243 + 5 = 248). (In th e analogy of a huma n being, these correspond to all the various sub -organs of the three main systems of the body, the nervous system, the cardiac system (which includes the respira tory system ) and the digestive system. However, above in G -dliness , these 248 limbs correspond to the 248 positive commandments of the Torah, which are the “Vessels” and vehicles which draw out the Essential Light of G -d. Moreover, it should be noted tha t there are also 365 veins and arteries in a human being which correspond to the 365 negative commandments of the Torah.) (Obviously, Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - the Essence of the Infinite Light of G -d has no body or form , whatsoever, and as explained, the Light is “ Bli Mah – Without What ness”. Rather, this “form” is only in regard to the vessels, of how the Essential Light of G -d ve sts within the vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut and, ultimately, with Creation as a whole. Moreover, as explained in footnote 22, even the vessels of the world of Atzilut are completely intangible, and are only the source from which actual creation issues forth, as will be explained later.) 28 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a. The aspect of garments - Levushin , and the differen ce between them and Vessels – Kelim , will be explained later. (This parenthesis may be skipped by the beginner who is reading this chapter for the first time. However, i t should be returned to later. Parenthetically, a lthough we previously said that the essential light of the soul is an essential light which is completely intangible ( Bli Mah – Without What) , in truth, generally speaking, the souls of the Jewi sh people are from the “gar ments” of Thought, Speech and Action, which correspond to the worlds o f Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . Therefore, because of this , some Jewish souls will become more greatly aroused by G -dliness than other souls , as explained at length in Kuntres HaHitpa’alut . This is because the souls of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah already do have some kind of definition s and limitations . However, this is all in regard to the pervading light of the soul. However, the true essence of the Jewish soul is in the Essential Lights of the world of Atzilut and higher . Nonetheless, this generally remains concealed , for it is only in a n encompassing fashion , and is only revealed in the greatest Tzaddikim – Righteous People. ) 29 Now, the particular explanations of all of the above will come later on in the book. However, f rom all of the above we find that although there are many particular divisions of levels, in general, all of the above can be divided into three general levels or aspects. There is the aspect of the Essential Lights of the soul which transcend and are higher than the limitations of the vessels, i.e. the Chaya and Yechidah . These are called “ Ohr Makif – Encompassing Light”. Then ther e is the aspect of the three general vessels of the Brain ( Neshamah ), the Heart ( Ruach ) and the Liver ( Nefesh ), (which includes all of their particular subdivisions) . These are called “ Ohr Pnimee – Pervading Light” or “ Kelim – Vessels”. Then there is the aspect of the Garments - Levushin (of Thought, Speech and Action), as will later be explained. Let us now continue to understand the general matter of Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim )."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"However, [regarding] the genera l explanation of the matter of light s and vessel s, although there are many very different ways [to explain it] , it may , nonetheless, general ly [be understood as follows]: It is like the spiritual light and vitality ( Ohr V’ Chayoot ) of the spiritual [power o f] sight, as it vests and integrates in [a way of] physicality , in th e physical substance of the eye, [thus creating] the aspect of physical sight. 30   30 The difference between Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim ) is like the difference between spiritual Light ( Ohr ) and Vitality ( Chayoot ). The aspect of Light ( Ohr ) radiates in a transcendent manner, in a way of separatene ss. This is comparable to the light of the sun, as it radiates within a vessel such as a house. There i s no actual rela tion or comparison between the light of the sun and the house at all, and the light does not “contribute” anything to the house, except that it brightens it . However, the house remains a house, exactly as it was before the sunlight radiated into it. This is evidenced by the fact that no profound change comes about as a result of th e unification of the light and the house . However, the a spect of Vitality ( Chayoot ) is comparable to the vitality and the life force of the soul as it merges and integrates wit h the vessel of the body. The life force is drawn down in a way of descent , to the point that there is actually some kind of relationsh ip and co mparison between the two. Moreo ver, from the influx and merging o f the life force of the soul with the physical vessel of the body , a profoundly new entity comes into being . For example , from the influx of the V itality ( Chayoot ) of the soul into the vessel of the Br ain, a radical change takes place in that active physical intellect comes about, or if there is an influx of vitality to the eye, physical sight takes place etc. However , it must be pointed out that in the life force of the soul there also is an asp ect of influence in the way of Light ( Ohr ). This is the aspect of the vitality and life force of the soul, which rest s upon the entirety and totality of the body equally . This aspect of the soul does not come in a way of “closeness” or qual itative comparison to the vessel of the body. Rather, it is similar to the aforementioned analogy of the light of the sun. It rests upon the body in a conc ealed fashion and does not integrate within the particular organs of the body whatsoever. This is the aspect of a Light ( Ohr ) as opposed to the aspect of Vitality ( Chayoot ). This is as explained (in chapters 9 and 19) , that the concept of an Ohr – Light, is that it is a revelation of influence, but with out change at all. Similarly, although the genera l life force of the soul is considered a descent in comparison to the essence of the soul as it is prior to its being invested in the body, nevertheless, even after it becomes invested in the body, the soul also dwells upon it in a concealed manner and rem ains essentially spiritual and apart. That is, it remains in its essential state, just as it was prior to being invested in the body, with no change whatsoever. (The proof for this is from the fact t hat a blind person or a handicapped person can give bir th to a person who is complete and whole in all his faculties .) This is not the case in regard to the vitality ( Chayoot ) of the soul which merges and integrates with in the vessels of the body. In the issuance of vitality ( Chayoot ) there indeed is a chang e in its radia nce from how it was prior to being invested in the body , as compared to how it is after being invested in the body. This matter is so much so that the vitality ( Chayoot ) can actually be called by the name of its corresponding vessel. (It is because of this that it may be called a Vessel ( Keli ) altogether, because when the term “vessel” ( Keli ) is used, it does not refer to a vessel which is empty of light. I f this was the case , it c ould not be called a vessel at all, but would just be called “substance” or “matter” ( Chomer ). Rather, it is called by the term “Vessel” ( Keli ) specifically when it is merged with the issuance of life force and vitality of the soul. It is specifically the integration of the two together which is called a “ Keli – Vessel”.) This may be understood by a comparison to the light of the [power] of sight as it is within the vessel of the eye. Although it dwells within the vessel of the eye, it nonetheless is in an aspect of transcendence and separateness. For this reas on one cannot see in the dark. It is only when the vessel of the eye receives in the way of a rebounding light ( Ohr Chozer ), i.e. when it receives the radiance of the light of the sun (or any other light) , that it becomes prepared to receive the spiritual light of the power of sight. Th at is , the light of the power of sight is then automatically drawn forth in to the eye in a way of closeness , to the point that it becomes bound with the vessel of the eye in an in ner way. (A t first, in the darkness, this p ower of sight only dwelt upon the vessel of the eye in an external encompassing manner. It is only when it was aroused from below (i.e. by the light of the sun) that it was drawn forth into the vessel of the eye to create physical vision). We find that w hen these two merge together (i.e. the spiritual power of sight and the physical vessel of the eye), physical vision is born. This is similarly the case with the aspect of the light of the intellect. Although this light dwells upon the brain of an adult, nonetheless, it only dwells there in an encompassing manner ( Ohr Makif ). However, through the intermediary of Hitbonenut (Intellectual T oil ), the intellectual power and light of the soul is drawn forth in a way of closeness, into the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" Now, two aspect s are [involved] in this : 31 The first is a change of existence, from spiritual to physical. [This is to say that ] physical sight grasps physicality , which is n ot the case with the spiritual light of [the power of] sight. This is similarly the case with the light of the spiritual potential power of intelligence which integrates with the physicality of the vessel of the brain, to the point that it is called , Hitc hachmoot - “ Active I ntellect”. Likewise, [there is a change of existence] from the [spiritual] potential power to move as it [vests] within actual physical movement. So too, [there is a change of existence] from the spiritual potential power of growth as i t becomes integrated and vested in the actual physical growth of a physical plant. 32 The second [aspect ] is the matter o f the limitation and measure of the substance of the vessel. [This is to say that ] it is limi ted and quantified with [specific ] measure . An example [of this is that] physical sight [is only clear] up to sixty miles. Similarly, [both] the matter of active [physical] intellect or physical movement s, spread forth specifically with con straint s and limitation s, unti l their limited strength expires . For example, the strength of the physical comprehension of the vessel of the brain diminish es and expire s due to the limited capacity of the vessel. Similarly, the physical power of movement of the strength of the arm will diminish and expire due to [strenuous] activity, or when lifting a heavy load and the like. This is because of the limitation of the [physical] power to move . (This is not the case with       substance of the ves sel of the brain ( Ohr Pnimee ). When these two are found together, intellect is born. This is likewise so with the power of movement of the hand. Although this power of movement dwells upon the hand in a concealed fashion, his hand will not move. It is the intermediary of the desire to move, which forces the power of movement to descend in a way of “closeness” within the vessel of the physical hand, to the point that when these two are found together , physical movement is born . We observe this in the ma tter of the spiritua l power of growth as well. This is to say that although this power dwells upon the earth in a concealed manner, it will not cause anything to grow until it is aroused thro ugh the intermediary of a seed being planted in the earth . When one sows a seed in to the ground there is an “arousal of the feminine waters” ( Ha’al aat Mayin Nukvin ) from below, which causes this power to descend from above ( Hamshachat Mayin Dchurin ) and be drawn forth, to vest and merge within the physicality of the e arth in an internal way, thus causing the seed to grow in actuality. 31 From all of the analogies in the previous footnote, we find that there are two main differences between the Light ( Ohr ) which radiates in an encompassing manner ( Ohr Makif ), and the asp ect of the Vessels ( Kelim ) which is the aspect of the merging of the light within the vessel in an internal and pervading manner ( Ohr Pnimee ). 32 The first difference between the encompassing Light ( Ohr Makif ) and the pervading light ( Ohr Pnimee ) of the ve ssels ( Kelim ) is that there is a change of existence, from spiritual and transcendent to physical and pervading. In the essential Light ( Ohr ) itself, there is no change or difference from before it vests within the vessels and after it vests within the m, because even after it vests within the vessels it remains transcendent and s eparate. (The proof that there is no change in the essential encompassing light of the soul was explained previously, in the fact that a blind person can give birth to a seeing pe rson. Likewise, one who is missing a limb can indeed give birth to a complete child. This is because there is no change or difference in the transcendent encompassing light of the soul, which encompasses the “Vessels” of the body.) Moreover, as explaine d in chapter ten, the essential powers of the s oul are completely beyond definition. In other words , the essential light of the power of movement of the soul cannot be called “movement” at all, since there is no movement there whatsoever . The same is tru e of the power of sight, and all the other essential soul powers. However, in the aspect of the Vitality ( Chayoot ) which is called a Vessel ( Keli ) (i.e. the inner pervading light) there is a descent of the light to the point that its essential spirituali ty is changed , making it possible for it to be the source of physical influence. In this pervading light of the soul, there are the divisions of the powers of sight and hearing etc. Moreover, there is a change from spiritual to physical."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"the essential spiritual potential power of movement , which has no limitation or cessation . This is evidenced by [the fact that] in a sudden panic, one may lift something which [under normal circumstances] is much heav ier than his ability [to lift ]. This comes from the aspect of the encompassing [lights of the soul], as is known.) 33 Now, this i s [the general principle] in every matter of “ Substance and Form ” ( Chomer V’ Tzurah ). 34 This is to say that aside from the fact that the “substance” comes in [a way of] a change of existence, it also limits the “form”. N onetheless, the “substance” has a si milar ity and likeness to the “form” , such as the “substance” of the vessel of the eye [which is specifically suited] for sight or the “substance” of the vessel of the brain [ which is specifically suited] for thought, and the like. 35   33 The second di fference between the encompassing Light ( Ohr Makif ) and the pervading Light ( Ohr Pnimee ) of the vessels ( Kelim ) is the aspect of the limitation of the vessels, because the essential encompassing Light ( Ohr Makif ) is still completely infinite. The proof fo r this is from the fac t that in a sudden panic, one will be able to lift much more than his physical “vessels” and limbs are normally capable of liftin g, or he will be able to run much fast er and further than his legs would normally be capable of carrying him etc. This is because there is an additional radiance from the encompassing light ( Ohr Makif ) of his soul, which is infinite. (This is the basis for various forms of martial arts which use various practices to induce the encompassing light of the anim al soul to perform feats which would normally be impossible, such as breaking a concrete block with the bare hand .) In contrast, the radiance of light which merges within the vessels is indeed limited according to the capacity of the vessels. This is lik e the examples given above regarding the limits of the intellectual power of the brain, or the power of movement as it is in the hand, or the limitation of the power of sight as it is in the eye. These limitation s are specifically imposed by the vessels . A further proof of this is from the fact that in order t o expand these limitations, such as the power of movement (i.e. physical strength), or the intellectual powers of the brain, one must strengthen the vessels specifically. That is, in order for the p owe r of movement as it is invested in the hand to be strengthened, it must be developed through a regimen of exercise. In other words , the capacity of the vessel must be expanded to accommodate and draw forth more light from the essential power of movemen t in a n inner manner ( Ohr Pnimee ). The same is true of the intellectual power of the brain. In order for it to be able to co ntain and accommodate greater intellectual light, the vessel of the brain must be strengthened through Hitbonenut - intellectual toil and study. 34 Substance ( Chomer ) and Form ( Tzurah ) is another way of saying Vessel ( Keli ) and Light ( Ohr ). 35 From all of the previous explanations we find that the aspect of the Light ( Ohr ) completely transcends and is separate from the Vessels ( Kelim ), to the point where there is literally no comparison between the Light ( Ohr ) and the Vessels ( Kelim ). However, at first glance there is a contradiction to this from the fact that the Rebbe explains above that the Substance ( Chomer ) of the Vessel ( Keli ) is si milar to the Form ( Tzurah ) of the Light ( Ohr ). Moreover, t here are several proofs for the similarity between the two. The first is from the fact that these two (the Light - Ohr and the Vessels – Kelim ) become bound wit h one another to the point that they form a single e ssential entity, as explained above . A second proof is from the fact that a Light ( Ohr ) will only become bound with a Substance ( Chomer ) i.e. Vessel ( Keli ), which is suited and prepared speci fically for that particular kind of light. For example, the spiritual light of sight will vest specifically in the v essel of the eye. However, if the spiritual power of sight were to radiate in the foot, its radiance could not b e accepted by the foot, but would rather be rejected, and the foot would n ot see . Likewise, the opposite is also true. The power to walk will specifically vest within the feet, but will be rejected by the vessel of the eye. A third proof is from the fact that we observe that the growth of the Form ( Tzurah ) specifically comes simultaneous to and in conjunction with the growth of the Substance ( Chomer ), as will soon be expl ained in this chapter . Rather, the explanation of the matter is that the Form ( Tzurah ), i.e. the Light ( Ohr ), as it is in its essential state , is comp letely and utterly removed even from the aspect of spreading forth to influen ce and vest within the vessels ( Kelim ), i.e. the Substance ( Chomer ). The fact that the Substance ( Chomer ) in relation to the Form ( Tzurah ) is called a Vessel ( Keli ) for the Light ( Ohr ), and that the Vessel is similar to the Form as mentioned above, is only in relation to the last and lowest level of the Form ( Tzurah ). However, the actual essence of the Form ( Tzurah ) so completely transcends the aspect of “influence” to become “merged” w ithin the Vessels, that it ca nnot be grasped and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" How ever, the “substance ” is made from th e thickening and condensation 36 of the spiritual “form”, from its lowest 37 level . 38 For example, the power of physical growth comes about from the last level of the spiritual [power] of growth. Similarly, the last level of the spiritual life force of the soul becomes vested within the [physical] blood, as stated, 39 “For, the blood is the soul”. Likewise , the l ast level of the light o f the spiritual intellect integrates with the “substance” of the v essel of the brain and the l ast level of the condensation of the s piritual [power] of sight integrates with the “substance” of the vessel of the eye. Because of this [phenomenon] we observe that the growth of the [physical] “substance” often comes simultaneous to the growth of the [spiritual] “form ”, literally as one. For example, the developmental growth of the “substance” of the [ph ysical] body is simultaneous to the developmental growth of the spiritual l ight and vitality of the “form”, such as [the fact that] the dev elopmental growth and abili ty of the “substance” of the [physical] brain comes in proportion to the development of the light and fo rm of the [spiritual] intellect, so that when a child matures and the light of his intellect develops spiritually, then automatically, the ability of th e vessel of his brain develop s [as well]. This is as stated, 40 “Days speak and many years teach wisdom ” . That is to say , the vessel becomes developed in proportion to the light , each and every day until the age of seventy , at which time a person reaches i ntellectual maturity, as is known. 41 This will suffice for those of understanding. End of Chapter Twenty Seven       contained in vessels altogether . Rather, it only dwells upon the vessels , so to speak, in an encompassing fashion , and is therefore called an Encompassing Light ( Ohr Makif ). 36 The three letter root of the word Hagshamah is Geshem which means condensation or materialization. Because of this the Hebrew word for rain is Geshem. 37 The text reads, “from its last level”. 38 This is similar to the explanation in the previous chapter o f how the “something of the nothing” descends to become the “nothing of the something”. That is, although the “something of the nothing” is also still an intangible essence, like the aforementioned Omek Hamoosag – Depth of the comprehended concept, noneth eless, it is the source for actual tangibility and “something – Yesh ” of actual comprehension . It therefore becomes the “nothing of the something”, the intangible source for the tangible comprehension. The same is true regarding every matter of the “thic kening of the intangible Lights”. Moreover, just as in the example, in order for this “thickening” of the essential intangible light of the intellect to occur, it is necessary for there to be an arousal from above (through Hitbonenut – Contemplation and s tudy), so too, with every “thickening” of the intangible Lights of the soul it is necessary for there to be an a rousal from below, as explained above in footnote 30. 39 Deuteronomy 12:23 40 Job 32:7 41 This spiritual growth of intellectual maturity is accompl ished specifically through the development of a person’s intellect through Torah study. When he studies and draws forth intellectual light from his soul, his brain will develop in conjunction with this spiri tual growth, to accommodate the new influx of th e inner light of the intellect . In this way, after years of daily Torah study, he will reach a level of true intellectual maturity and wisdom. However, if he does not develop the spiritual light of his intellect through Torah study , his brain will also re main developed."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Eight Now, the analogue from all of the above analogies regarding the aspects of the three vessels of the brain, the heart and the liver, can be generally understood as follows: The light of Chochmah of [the world of] Atzilut as it is emanated from the Essential Light of the Emanator, is comparable to the light of the spiritual intell ect itself, as it is drawn from the essential potential Chochmah power of the aspect of the essence of the soul. It still is literally one with the source from whence it was hewn . [This is] is similar to 1 “ The flame [which is bound to the coal]” , or like the aforementioned revelation of the desi re from the essential [hidden ] desire of the aspect of Adam Kadmon . 2   1 See Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishnah 7. Also see c hapter nineteen of this book where this was explained at length. 2 In order to properly understand this chapter, we must take into account several matters which were previously discussed. That is, we must understand the descent and chaining down from the Essence of the soul until it finally radiates within the body. As explained in chapters 10 and 11, the essence of the soul is an absolute simplicity, and is beyond any limitations or divisions into specific powers. Nonetheless, all the specific powers of the soul are there in an essential state in such a way that they are not separate from the essence altogether. As explained, they are so absolutely embedded in the essence of the soul that it is not possible to say that in the soul they are “united”. Th is is because their inclusion in the essence of the soul is totally in the way of Heyulie abilities. For example, the potential power to conceptualize is the fact that it is within the ability of the essence of the soul to conceptualize all concepts. How ever, this power cannot be called an intellectual power, since, in this state, it is not within the category of intellect altogether, but is rather, totally a Heyulie ability. The same is true of all the other powers of the soul, such as the power of kind ness or the power of sternness etc. Now, when the soul is aroused to enliven the body, initially, there is a general drawing forth of the soul. This general drawing forth includes all the particulars of the vitality for the specific powers of the soul, as they will be in the body. Moreover, every particular in their development throughout a person’s life is included in this general drawing forth. This was called “The desire for the desire”. Within this general issuance, all the powers of the soul are dr awn from their concealed Heyulie state as they are in the essence of the soul, into revelation. This may be seen in the fact that there is a “desire for a desire” (or a “self perception”) for each particular that actually does come into revelation. An ex ample of this is a person who has intellectual talent. His “desire for a desire” constantly vests within and creates a desire for Chochmah - Insight, even before he has any particular subject to contemplate. This is likewise the case in regard to a person who is naturally kind. His “desire for a desire”, which is his self perception as a kind person, vests within and constantly creates a desire for kindness, even when there is no one to bestow a kindness to. As previously explained, the “desire for the de sire” (or self perception) for any specific matter (such as for Chochmah or Chessed ) is the general source for every particular desire that will ever come into revelation from it. For example, the “desire for the desire” for wisdom ( Chochmah ) is the gener al source for every revealed particular desire for any particular wisdoms throughout his life. (This “desire for the desire” of Chochmah is called Chochmah K’Dooma – The Primal Wisdom or Kedmat Sechel – The Primordial Intellect.) Now, when a particular d esire is drawn forth from this general desire, that is, when he encounters a particular intellectual subject matter which interests him, then an entirely new desire is aroused within him, i.e the desire to conceptualize this"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" Now, although this is merely like an indicator or a color , 3 non etheless, they are called the “T en sefirot without what ness ”, because they still are intangible. This is because a color is also essential, since it is impossible to have an oppo site color to the essence of a thing. [An example of t his is when] the color of [the inside of] an apple is white, which indicates its essential sweetness. Likewise, although it is [coming forth] into a separate matter, nonetheless, the light of the intellect or desire which leans t owards kindness, indicates the essence. 4       particular concept. This desir e is called “A desire which is relevant to action ( Ratzon HaShayach L’Asiyah )”. Now, the actual intellectual involvement in the matter itself is called the “Action ( Asiyah )”. That is, when there is actual intellectual toil which causes the vitality of hi s soul ( Chayoot ) to merge with the vessel of his brain, thus creating actual intellect, this is called “the Action – Asiyah ”, and is called “ Sof – the end or culmination”. However, the particular desire for that particular intellectual matter is the aspec t of Tchilah –“The beginning” of this “ Sof – End”, since it precedes it. That is, this particular desire is not yet in an aspect of a Light within a Vessel ( Ohr B’Keli ), since that only occurs when the intellectual light of the soul actually merges with t he vessel of the brain, creating actual intellect. Nevertheless, this particular desire is the beginning which leads to the end action, because it is the main source, power and beginning of the existence of actual intellect (which constitutes the integrat ion of the spiritual intellectual light with the physical vessel of the brain). Moreover, once this particular desire is aroused, it will come to fruition, i.e. it is the beginning to an end. This is not the case, however, in regard to the “desire for th e desire”. It is possible for the “desire for the desire” to never come into actual revelation or fulfillment. For this reason, the “desire for the desire” is not called a “beginning to an end”, but rather, it includes both the beginning and the end lite rally as one, “In one glance”, so to speak, as previously explained. Now, from all of the above it is understood that there are three levels which are drawn forth in succession from the essence of the soul. The first is the aspect of the ten essential po wers which are embedded in the essence of the soul. This is the revelation of the essence of the soul, and since these powers exist in an essential state, they therefore transcend and are beyond even being called a “general” or “encompassing light” for a “particular” or “inner light”, as explained in chapter thirteen. The second level is the matter of the ten concealed powers, which are the aspect of the “desire for the desire” or the “self perception”. This is the spreading forth of the soul outside of its essential state (as previously explained regarding the matter of Adam D’Briyah – Man of Creation). Nonetheless, this spreading forth is only in a general manner, i.e. the “desire for the desire” and “self - perception” of the entirety of one’s life in a holistic general manner, as previously explained. The third level is the revelation of the ten powers of the soul in a particular manner, such as the revelation of a particular desire from the general “desire for the desire”. However, the revelation of the particular desire on this level is still beyond the category of a Light within a Vessel ( Ohr B’Keli ), and is still only Light ( Ohr ). (Only afterwards, from Chochmah down does the light merge and become integrated within vessels, as will soon be explai ned.) 3 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (This is as explained before at the end of chapter nineteen regarding the matter of “He calls o ut the generations from the beginning ”, that this refers to the ten sefirot of Atzilut which came out of the concealment of Ad am Kadmon , which is the revelation of the [general] desire in a separate thing. ) 4 Now, continuing the explanation in footnote two, the revelation of the general desire, which is generally called “the desire for the desire”, is the aspect of a simple essen tial revelation of the essence of the soul. Since it is the revelation of the essence of the soul, therefore it is similar to it and there is no profound change of existence (similar to a change from spiritual existence to physical existence. In contrast, the revelation of the particular desires (from this general desire) could come in a way of a profound change of existence. This is because it is a particular revelation and is therefore like a completely new creation, which was not in the simple essence of the soul except in a way of a Heyulie ability, in that the soul is able to bring it out. (An example of this was given in chapter nineteen, regarding a person who is essentially kind. His essential kindness may be expressed in any number of ways. He may give food to a poor person, or he may give him money, or speak kind words to him etc. All these are particular desires for external acts of kindness, which are separate matters from the essential kindness itself, as it is in his soul. As explained in chapter nineteen at length, these desires are only indicative of his essential kindness and reveal that he is"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" Therefore, [it is understood that ] the existence of the lights of the ten sefirot [of Atzilut ] comes from the aspect of the essential letters of the Emanator, [i.e. Adam Kadmon ]. 5 An       a kind person in his essence. Nonetheless, as explained there, they all come from the same source, which is his “desire for the desire” or “self - perception” of being a kind person, which is bound up to the essential characteristic of kindness in the very essence of his soul.) However, in truth, even this particular revelation of desire is still a completely simple revelation which is completely b ound up to the essence of the soul, literally. This is evidenced from the fact that it is impossible for a person to have a desire which differs, even in the slightest way, from the essential nature of his soul. For example, if he is a naturally kind per son, the revelation of his particular desires will always be for kindness, and he will not desire or derive any pleasure from cruelty, which is the opposite of kindness. The same is true of a person who is cruel by nature. (However, this is not the case in regard to the aspect of Chochmah and below, wherein there is a profound change in the nature of the expression of the soul, to the point that it is possible for his intellect to cause him to act in a way which is the opposite of his essential nature. In other words, he can act this way even if he does not desire it.) If this is the case, then it is clear that even the revelation of the particular desires are the aspect of a revelation of the essence of the soul, and are totally bound to it. The example for this was given above, regarding the matter of revelation in the manner of an indicator, like the desire for a particular act of kindness which is an indication of his essential kindness, or like the whiteness of an apple which, in and of itself, is no t connected or relevant to the essential sweetness of the apple etc. However, these are revelations (or indicators) bring to light the essential kindness of a person or the essential sweetness of an apple etc. This is evidenced by the fact that it is imp ossible for there to be a revelation which is the opposite of the essence, as explained above. That is, it is impossible for a green apple to be sweet. The same is true of the revelation of particular desires from the general “desire for the desire” or “self perception”. From all of the above, the first two paragraphs of this chapter are clearly understood. That is, although the revelation of the light of Atzilut (which relative to Adam Kadmon is a particular desire) is only an indication of the essenti al desire of Adam Kadmon (which is the general desire) and of essential nature of the Essence ( Atzmoot ), it is nevertheless similar to the Light of the Essence ( Ohr HaAtzmee ), and totally bound up with it. Therefore, it is still considered to be an essent ial revelation and indication of the Essence of the concealment of Adam Kadmon and of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). 5 This is to say that although the revelation of the particular desire is still an essential revelation, nonethel ess, because it comes forth into a particular matter, it only comes from the external “letters” of the essential general holistic desire. (In other words, Keter of Atzilut comes only from the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon , i.e. the “letters” of the Ema nator, as explained at the end of chapter nineteen.) These “letters” are what limit and conceal the whole of the general desire so that a particular desire can come forth into existence. Nonetheless, since these are the letters of the essential desire, th ey too are completely essential, and are not separate from the essential light. This may be understood by how a particular desire comes forth from the “desire for the desire” and self -perception. As explained above, the self perception of a person is an intangible and essential general desire, which does not actually come forth into existence. Rather, as mentioned above, the particular desires are drawn forth from the general desire only in the way of a revelation and indication of the essential desire. Therefore, it is only from the end of the essential “letters” of description of oneself, within his perception of himself as a whole, that the light of the particular desires is drawn forth into revelation. For example, from the letters of description in the self perception of a person who perceives himself as being wise, the desire for particular wisdoms will be drawn forth etc. In other words, from Malchut of Chochmah of Adam Kadmon comes Keter of Chochmah of Atzilut . Similarly, Malchut of Chessed of Adam Kadmon is the tangible “letters” of the desire to be kind as they exist in the self perception. It is specifically the letters of the “desire to be kind”, which becomes the inner light of Keter of Chessed of Atzilut , which is the desire to do a partic ular act of kindness. Therefore, it is understood, that from the essential “letters” of the “Name” A”V (of Chochmah ) of Adam Kadmon , (i.e. the letters of the intangible “desire for the desire” for wisdon) the light of Chochmah of the world of Atzilut (the desire for a particular wisdom) comes forth. The same is true of all the names mentioned above. However, it must be understood that even these letters are still intangible and essential. This may be understood by understanding the difference in between the “letters” of the intangible and essential depth of a concept ( Omek HaMoosag ) compared to the tangible “letters” of the explanations"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"example of this is the name A”V from which the aspect of the Light of Chochmah of Atzilut comes i nto revelation. This name indicates the essential Chochmah of Adam Kadmon . Likewise, the name Sa”G indicates the essential light of Binah of Adam Kadmon . T his is [true of all the names ] A”v, Sa”G, [ Ma”H and Ba”N ] which precede the ten sefirot of Atzilut . They are [therefore] called , “T he names of the Emanator”. 6 This is similar to how the last aspect of the spiritual Form ( Tzurah ) becomes bound to the beginning of the existence of the light and form within the substance of the vessel ( Keli ). 7 This is in accordance to what was previously explained regarding the , “blood which is the soul”, and [regarding] the spiritual power of growth, and [regarding] the eye and the brain etc. 8       which come from it. In other words, when a person has a flash of insight, he has an intellectual perception of the “le tters” of the intangible and essential depth of the subject matter. Nonetheless, the fact that these “letters” of the depth are still entirely intangible is evidenced from the fact that he cannot convey the actual depth itself to a recipient, such as a st udent. Rather, he can only draw forth the “letters” of explanation surrounding the depth, through which the recipient will be able to perceive the intangible depth as well. (Now, in truth, this analogy of the difference between the essential letters of t he intangible depth of the concept and the tangible letters of explanation is actually an analogy which belongs later on in the scheme of things, in regard to how the world of Atzilut is the source for the actual “somethingness” and tangibility of the worl d of Briyah . This is because, as mentioned in the previous chapter, even the external vessels of Atzilut are still “nothing – Ein ” and are only the source for actual tangibility and “somethingness - Yesh ”. Nonetheless, the analogy here, in regard to the relationship between Adam Kadmon and the world of Atzilut, brings to light the difference between the essential and intangible “letters” of the source of emanation - Atzilut , i.e. Adam Kadmon which is called HaMa’atzeel - The Emanator, and the “letters” of Atz ilut which follow from it and are already considered to be an emanation of light from the Emanator which indicates and reveals His essence but is not actually essential to Him.) 6 To avoid confusion, it must be pointed out that the above paragraph refers t o the four names ( A”v, Sa”G, Ma”H and Ba”N ) of Adam Kadmon , as opposed to the four names of the world of Atzilut which were mentioned at the beginning of the previous chapter. Rather, this paragraph explains how the inner lights ( Keter ) of the world of Atzilut come out of the “names” and “letters” (i.e. Malchut ) of Adam Kadmon , as explained in the previous footnotes. The names of the world of Atzilut , and how they are difference than these names of Adam Kadmon , will be explained later in the chapter. 7 Th is was explained at length in the previous chapter, especially in footnotes 35 and 38. 8 As explained previously, the Form ( Tzurah ), i.e. the Light ( Ohr ), as it is in its essential state, is completely and utterly removed even from the aspect of spreading forth to influence and vest within the vessels ( Kelim ), i.e. the Substance ( Chomer ). This is like the “desire for the desire” which is a singular essence which includes the whole of one’s life (or of Creation) in “one glance” and encompasses the whole of Creation equally. Similarly, as the soul powers exist in this first essential revelation, they are still in a state of singularity and unity, and cannot even be called “particular powers”. Rather, this is the general power of the soul, which encompasses the entire life of the soul equally. In this state, for example, the essential light of the power of movement of the soul cannot be called “movement” altogether, since no movement exists there whatsoever. Rather, it is only the potential power and abilit y for movement, as it essentially bound up in a way of singularity with the general encompassing life force of the soul. The same is true of the power of sight, and all the other essential soul powers. This general life force only dwells upon the vessels , so to speak, in an encompassing fashion, and is therefore called the general encompassing light ( Ohr Makif ) of the soul. This is to say that the actual essential being of the Form ( Tzurah ) of the soul completely transcends the aspect of particular influ ence and revelation, since it is a general revelation of the powers of the soul, as they are in a “single” general “glance”. Nevertheless, this is only in reference to the essence of the Form ( Tzurah ) or the essence of the Desire for the Desire ( Ratzon L’ Ratzon ). However, from the external “letters” of this general Form ( Tzurah ), comes the light of the particular revelations. This is because, as explained previously, from the external letters and description of one’s self, in one’s self - perception of him self as a whole, his particular desires are drawn forth. In the same way, from the external letters of the general encompassing life force of the soul comes the revelation of the light of the particular"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" However, the aspect of the Vessel ( Keli ) which limits the light of Chochmah of Atzilut is like the light of the intellect as it is alread y merged withi n the substance of the brain. [In this case] t he substance of the brain only receives from the “thickening” of the end of the light of the intellect. Therefore, aside from the fact that there is a [profound] change of existence, it limits [ the light] . 9 This is similar to the light of Chochmah as it vests within the brain, which is [then] called “ Chochmah Mocha – Insight is the Brain”. 10 It is t hen that because of the aspect of the vessel of Chochmah , it comes into the aspect of a tangible e xistence of intellect, which is called , “T he conceptua lization of a certain specific concept ” . The same [principle applies] to the spiritual emotions in the “Heart” and the spiritual Nefesh in the “Liver”. 11       powers. In the same way, from the letters of Malchu t of Adam Kadmon (i.e. the four names mentioned above), the revelation of the ten sefirot of Keter of Atzilut are drawn forth. However, as previously explained, this is only the revelation of a particular Light and desire, which is only an indication of t he general encompassing light ( Ohr Makif ). This particular light and life force or particular desire is only the very beginning of particular revelation, and has not yet merged within a vessel. For example, this is like the desire for a particular wisdom which has not yet actually merged within the vessel of the brain to create actual thought (i.e. a light integrated within a vessel). Similarly, it is like the revelation of the life force and vitality ( Chayoot ) of the particular power of intellect and co nceptualization. It is still only the light ( Ohr ) of the potential power to conceptualize itself. However, as explained in a previous footnote, this particular light is already considered to be the beginning to the end action, and is thus called “The des ire which is relevant to the action – Ratzon HaShayach L’Asiyah ”. This is because it is already a particular light for a particular action, which is not the case in regard the general desire or life force, as previously explained. The Rebbe will now cont inue, and explain the actual merging of this particular light and life force ( Chayoot ) with the vessels. 9 As explained in previous footnotes, the Light (i.e. Keter ) of Chochmah of Atzilut is comparable to the revelation of the particular power and vitalit y for conceptualization from the general power and encompassing life force of the soul. Now, even this particular power to conceptualize is still entirely intangible, and is not actual thought whatsoever. Rather, it is only the Light ( Ohr ) and Vitality ( Chayoot ), i.e. the particular potential power to conceptualize, from which actual insight and intellect later comes about. That is to say, it is still a Heyulie ability of the soul, which, although it is already a particular power, is nonetheless still a Heyulie ability and not actual conceptualization or thought at all. Now, this particular potential power also has “letters”. These “letters” are its limiting and defining vessels. This is similar to the “letters” of the flash of intellectual insight, whi ch becomes revealed from the particular potential power to conceptualize (which in turn receives from the general potential power and encompassing life force of the soul). That is to say, the actual flash of intellectual insight only receives from the end “letters” of the particular power to conceptualize, and not the whole of the particular power to conceptualize at all. Now, in this actual flash of intellectual insight, we observe that there is a limitation of even the particular power to conceptualize, which is still completely intangible. Moreover, in the flash of insight we observe an actual profound change of existence from a potential Heyulie ability to conceptualize, to an actual intellectual insight. 10 See Zohar ( Ra’ayah Mehemnah ) Pinchas 235b, a nd Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a. 11 This is to say that when the particular intellectual Heylie ability (i.e. the Light – Ohr ) merges with the Substance ( Chomer ) of the brain ( Mocha ), it creates actual Chochmah – Insight. Before this, however, it was only the intangible Light and potential Heyulie ability of Chochmah , but not actual Chochmah . When these two unite, (the intangible Light and the actual Substance ( Ohr V’Chomer ), the vessel ( Keli ) of actual Chochmah – Insight is formed. It is the mergin g of these two which creates the vessel ( Keli ) of actual Chochmah – Insight which is called by the term “brain ( Mocha )”. However, this vessel of actual insight ( Chochmah ) is also still intangible, and is only the source for actual tangible intellectual th ought and explanations. This is comparable to how the abundant tangible explanations of a concept come out of the intangible depth of the concept, the Omek Hamoosag . However, as previously explained, the Omek Hamoosag itself, is still an intangible depth , which is only the source for actual tangibility and “somethingness”. As will be stated at the end of the next paragraph, “This is called the somethingness of the Light, as it appears to be the aspect of a ‘something’ with a tangible existence”. However , it is not an"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Thi s, then, is the matter of the “T hree rulers above”. These are the three general vessels for the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . The Neshamah , which is the aspect of the intellectual sefirot of Chochmah and Binah of Zeir Anpin , [vests] within the “Brain”, the Ruach [vests] with in the “Heart”, [and the Nefesh vests within the “Liver”]. 12 These [vessels] are the “letters” of the Lights of Atzilut , which [refers to] the matter of the four names, A”v, Sa”G, [ Ma”H and Ba”N ] of Atzilut . 13 These [four names] are called the vessels for the [light of the] ten sefirot of Atzilut , which limit the light and restrain it , because the vessels are made from the “thickening” of the lights, as stated in Etz Chaim . 14 As is known, this is called, “The something ness of the Li ght”, as it is appears in an aspect of a “something”, with tangible existence. 15 This will suffice for those of understanding. (We find that there are two types of names of A”V, Sa”G etc. The first [set of names] is before [the world of] Atzilut [with in Adam Kadmon ]. 16 The secon d [set of nam es], which are the vessels that limit, is after [the world of] Atzilut . 17 According to thi s, when a person       actual “something”, but is only the “something” of the “nothing” of the intangible Light. The same is true of all the other vessels of the world of Atzilut , such as the “Heart” and the “Liver”. (In other words, even though there are actual vessels in the world of Atzilut, and therefore limitations of the light and a profound change of existence etc, nevertheless, even the vessels of the world of Atzilut are still intangible. For example, even in the flash of insight, it is apparent that th ere is a change of existence and limitation in comparison to the particular potential Heyulie power of conceptualization itself. Nevertheless, the “letters” of the flash of insight are still an intangible depth, and only the source for tangible explanatio ns etc.) 12 This is to say that the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah of the world of Atzilut are the intangible Lights ( Orot ) which become merged and integrated within the Substance ( Chomer ) of the Vessels ( Kelim ) of the world of Atzilut . In other words, the Nes hamah is the intangible lights of the intellectual sefirot ( ChaBa”D ) of the world of Atzilut . These intangible lights merge with the substance of the vessel of the “brain” of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut, in the manner explained above. Likewise, the Ruach is th e intangible Lights of the emotional sefirot ( ChaGa”T ) of Atzilut , which merges within the substance of the vessel of the “heart” of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . The same is true of the Nefesh which is the intangible Lights of the gut -emotional sefirot ( NeHi”Y ) of Atzilut . These vessels are what bring the intangible Light of the world of Atzilut out into revelation. This is analogous to how it is, specifically, the vessel of the flash of insight from Chochmah which reveals the essential light of a concept to t he actual comprehending intellect of Binah . Moreover, as explained, it is from this vessel of actual insight that actual tangible explanations are created in the comprehension and thought of Binah. Likewise, it is from the “thickening” of the intangible Light of the emotional powers that actual felt emotions may be brought forth etc. 13 In contrast to the names mentioned previously, which are the “letters” and Names which limit the light of Adam Kadmon , the “letters” and Names of Atzilut are the vessels wh ich bring the intangible Light of Atzilut into revelation. The name A”V of Atzilut is the vessel for the particular Light of Chochmah of Atzilut . Sa”G is the vessel for the Light of Binah of Atzilut , Ma”H is the vessel for the Light of the Emotional sefi rot of Atzilut , and Ba”N is the vessel for the Light of Malchut of Atzilut . We find that there are two sets of names. The first set of names is before Atzilut from which the Light of Atzilut comes into revelation from Adam Kadmon , while the second set is the names which follow the world of Atzilut , and bring the Light of the Atzilut into revelation below (to Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah ). The relationship between these two will be explained in the next paragraph. 14 See Etz Chaim, ( Shaar Ha’Akoodim ) Shaar 6, Chapter 3. 15 This has already been explained in footnote number 9 of this chapter. 16 These names are the vessels which bring forth the ten particular Lights and Heyulie powers from their concealment in the singular general life force of Adam Kadmon . Th is was previously compared to how the particular desires come into revelation from the “letters” of the general “desire for the desire” and self - perception, wherein they are all included in a singular general “glance”. 17 These names are the vessels which b ring the particular lights and powers forth to become the actual source of tangibility in the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah (which will be explained later). This was"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"directs his attention to the [external] names, his [actual] intention is [ really ] to the source of the lights. 18 For example, a person w ho directs his attention to the aspect of the name A”V , the source of the light of Chochmah etc. , automatically is [also] directing his attention to the vessel of Chochmah , causing it to be drawn down. This will suffice for those of       compared to how the flash of intellectual insight brings forth actual tangible in tellectual comprehension, or tangible emotions and actions etc. 18 This is to say that when one comprehends the external name of the world of Atzilut , what he really comprehends is the essential light of Adam Kadmon , (all the way up to the very Essence of t he Infinite Light - Atzmut Ohr Ein Sof ). This may be understood through the following analogies: When a person has a flash of insight and grasps the intangible depth of a concept ( Omek HaMoosag ), this “Sight of the mind’s eye” of the intangible depth, sees all the way to the essential light of the matter, as it is as a whole. This is true even though the flash of insight is only the most external “somethingness” of the Light, and even though it comes about through a profound change of existence. An exampl e of this is that if someone were to announce, “There is a lion loose!” people would immediately become fearful. Now, how is it that from the word “lion”, people go into a panic? After all, the word “lion” is only a composition of a few measly letters an d sounds. However, from these external “letters” and “vessels” one can see to the very essence of the matter. That is, they grasp the very essence of what a lion is, i.e. the whole, of not just this particular lion, but literally of all lions. This perc eption includes all the desires, thoughts, feelings and actions etc, of the essence of all lions. However, it must be pointed out that, in truth, the word “Lion” is only a garment ( Levush ), and not actually the vessel ( Keli ). The vessel for the light of the essence is the intellectual sight and grasp of the intangible (but somewhat tangible) depth (the Omek Hamoosag ) of the matter of lions. This is to say that the actual vessel for this light is the intangible thought and intellectual sight which is what people think and perceive when the word “Lion” is mentioned. (The proof that the external word “Lion” is only a garment for this vessel of the Omek Hamoosag is from the fact that firstly, it can be said in any language, and secondly, no effect will be br ought forth in a person who does not recognize a Lion by this name. That is to say, the word itself is not essentially bound to the essence of the matter. However, in contrast, the perception of the intangible depth of the concept of “Lion” is equal even in people who speak different languages. This is because, in contrast to the garment , which is the letters of the word “Lion”, the intangible depth of the concept is bound to the very essential light of what a Lion is.) Moreover, when one grasps this ex ternal vessel of the depth of the concept, the essential light of the matter is drawn forth, and automatically radiates within this vessel. Similarly, as will be stated momentarily, when true Kabbalists devote their intention ( Kavanot ) during their prayer s to the various Names of the external vessels of the world of Atzilut , their actual intention and perception is to the very essence of G -d and not merely to the external “letters”. That is, although they grasp only the external vessels and names of the world of Atzilut , nonetheless, these names are bound with and reveal the very essence of the Light of Adam Kadmon (which is the radiance of the Essence of the Infinite Light within the Kav ). (This is in contrast to those fools who “meditate” on the externa l “letters” of the various holy books or names of G -d. In truth, they do not grasp the essential light at all, but only separate garments. This is because they have no real understanding of these names or their inner essential meaning. Such people are c omparable to one who meditates on the word “L -I-O- N” without ever having seen a Lion or knowing what a Lion is or what the word means altogether etc. For him, these letters of expression are only separate garments and are not vessels, and have nothing to do with the essence of the light. Such “meditation”, therefore, does not draw forth the light. In contrast, the vessel of the intangible depth of the matter ( Omek HaMoosag ) is literally bound up to the essence of the matter. The grasp of the depth of th e concept ( Omek HaMoosag ) automatically draws the essential light of the matter forth, into revelation, as is clearly understood from the above explanations. This is because, as previously mentioned, “He and His Organs are one”. This is to say that the e xternal vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut are literally bound up to the Essence of the Infinite Light - Atzmut Ohr Ein Sof .) (In addition, it must be pointed out that the grasp of this depth only comes about through complete self -investment and sublimation t o the Essence - Atzmoot which is brought about specifically through Hitbonenut contemplation into the secrets of Torah, as explained at length in the first portion of this book and in chapters 25 & 26.) The rest of the above parenthesis of the Rebbe may be understood from the explanations in this footnote. (The concept of Garments – Levushim and how it is different from Vessels – Kelim , will be explained later in chapters 38 and 39. Further explanations of the “letters” and “Names” will come later in the b ook, with the explanations of Malchut .)"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"understanding.

This, then, is the meaning of the statement, “[He made ten Tikkunim (Fixings )] which we call ten sefirot ... to show... to conduct [the worlds] etc.”, because Tikkunim (Fixings ) is the aspect of Vessels ( Kelim ) for the Lights ( Orot ) of [the world of] Atzilut .

Similarly , it is through the means of the heart which is the vessel for the spiritual light of love and kindness, that [this light] can come into the category of being influence d to a recipient. It is [specifically] because of this that the [vessels] are called Tikkunim – Fixings , [because they “fix” the ligh t] so that it can be drawn down from [the world of] Atzilut to [the world of] Briyah . In other words, it’ s [sole purpose is] only “to show” etc. 20 On the other hand , from the aspect of the Essential Light of the Emanator, [the sefirot] are called “T en sefirot without whatness”, as was explained above, and as explained elsewhere at length. 21 End of Chapter Twenty Eight 22   19 In other words, just as the physical vision of the eye may be drawn further by means of “fixings” in the form of eyeglasses, microscopes or telescopes, and the like, so too, the spiritual power of sight is drawn ou t by means of the substance of the organ of the eye. Similarly, the spiritual potential power to conceptualize is drawn forth by means of the vessel of the brain etc. Likewise, above, the essential intangible Lights ( Orot ) of the world of Atzilut are dra wn down into the tangibility of the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah only by means of the external “letters” of the Names and Vessels of the world of Atzilut . However, the Lights ( Orot ) themselves remain completely intangible, as was previously expla ined. 20 That is to say, it is only by means of the vessels that the inner Essence becomes revealed within the lower realms. Moreover, the realms of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are literally created by these external vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , as wi ll later be explained. 21 As explained at length previously, it is specifically the Vessels ( Kelim ) which bring the Light ( Ohr ) into a tangible state. This is to say that all tangibility comes about from the aspect of the vessels, rather than from the aspe ct of the Light, which is an intangible Essence. Because of this, we cannot actually even speak of sefirot in regard to the Essential Light. Rather, even the mention of a definition such as “ sefirot ”, is in reference to the Vessels ( Kelim ) within which t he Essential Light vests. This, then, is the meaning of the statement of the Zohar mentioned above, that “He brought forth ten vessels which we call ten sefirot ”. That is, the term “ sefirot” may only be applied to the vessels. In contrast, the Light ( Oh r ) of the sefirot is called “the ten sefirot without whatness”. In other words, the Lights are completely intangible, as has been clearly understood from all the previous explanations. 22 The next chapter will explain at length the source of the Substance ( Chomer ) of the Vessels ( Kelim ), and the source of the limitations of the vessels etc."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Twenty Nine Now, [it must be understood] , even in the Hitbonenut – contemplation of the Lights and Vessels ( Orot V’ Kelim ) of [the world of] Atzilut , in a more particular manner , that the primary intent is only [to understand] the matter of “He and His life force are one, [and He] and His organs are one” , that , in truth, there is no difference between “He and His life force are one” and “He and His organs are one”. 1 This is because even though the Lights are “ Bli Mah – without what ness” , [that is, they are intangible], while the Vessels are in an aspect of “ Yesh - something ness” [and are there fore tangible ], nevertheless, from the angle of the Essence of the Emana tor, He actually made the root for the e xistence of the Vessels before making the root for the existence of the Lights. 2 The fact that the Vessel comes about from the “thickening” of the Light [poses no contradiction to this ], since the root and source [of the vessels] preceded this. 3 This [source] is called the “Simple [P rimal] Matter – Chomer Pashoot ” or “ The Heyulie Matter ” which precedes the “Form – Tzoorah ” [of the Lights]. 4   1 This is to say that in their Essential source, there is no difference between the two matters at all. This is because, as will soon be explained, the source of the Lights ( Orot ) is from Chessed of the Infinite Light, while the source of the Vessels ( Kelim ) is from Gevurah of the Infinite Light. However, as explained in cha pters 10 and 11, the two qualities of Chessed and Gevurah of Atzmoot - The Essence, are literally one and the same Essential power. That is, they are so totally and completely one with the Essence of G -d that they cannot even be considered as being “unifi ed” with each other, as explained before at length. 2 As will soon be explained, the simple primal matter ( Chomer Pashoot ) which is the source of the Vessels ( Kelim ) is the aspect of the Reshimu – Impression. This source of the tangibility of the Vessels precedes the source of the Lights and is from the aspect of the radiance of the Kav – Line. 3 As explained previously, the Vessel is created from the “thickening” of the Lights. This is to say that the Vessel is created through the merging of intangible L ight ( Ohr ) with the tangible Substance ( Chomer ). When these two merge together a Vessel is created. However, the obvious question is, “Where did the substance of the vessels come from to begin with, so that it can merge with the lights?” The answer is t hat the “Simple primal substance – Chomer Pashoot ” (of the Reshimu ) which is the source of the vessels, actually preceded the radiance of the light of the Kav – Line. 4 A lthoug h the Lights are intangible and are therefore “ close ” to the Essence of the Ema nator, wh ile the Vessels which are tangibile , are therefore “distant” from it, nonetheless, this is only from our perspective as created beings. From His perspective however, the source of the Vessels was made before the source of the Lights. The source of the vessels is the Simple Heyulie Substance ( Chomer HaPashoot HaHeyulie ) which preceded the Form ( Tzurah ). We therefore see that from the angle of the revelation of the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishstalshelut ), the Lights precede the Vessels and are closer to the Essence of the Emanator, but in regard to their source , the Vessels preceded the Lights. This indicates in relation to the True Essence of G -d, the two are actually completely equal, literally, and that they both chain down from the True Essence of G -d equally. This is the meaning of t he Talmudic opinion that , “T he heaven s and the earth were created as one”, i.e. th ey are literally equal in relation to the Essence of G -d. (See Likkutei Biurim of Rabbi Hillel of Paritch , Chapter 29.)"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The explanation of this matter is known, and may be understood through the well know preface regarding the matter of vessels which actually limit. That is, there are two kinds of limitations ( G ’ vool ): The first is the essenti al potential power to limit. An example of this are the vessel s of the brain which limits or the eye which limits, and the like. However, this is still only in potential rather than in actuality. For example, in the hand there is the potential power to limit e very physical movement be fore it actually limits any movement . 5 Now, although the actual revealed limitation is , literally , exactly like the spiri tual potential power to limit of the hand , which is the root and source for the actual limitation, nevertheless, there is no compariso n between the potential power to limit and the actual limitation [itself] . 6 Firstly, on e is spiritual and essential while the other is physical and separate from the essence . Secondly, the po tential power to limit is not actual limitation. Rather, [the person] limits his stre ngth according to his will and choice , and it is [therefore] not a limitation of necessity, that is to say, [it is not] that he does no t have the power to spr ead forth further. Rather, he does not desire to spread forth further. [Th erefore], this is only [that which] makes limitations, while [ it itself] is not truly limited. [In other words, it is not] like an actual ized limitation , which is truly limited . (This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regardi ng the matter of the innerness of the vessels and the externality of th e vessels, as will be explained with the help of G -d. 7 ) [Through this] it may likewise be unders tood [regarding how it is] in the upper realm s, in the root and source of the vessels which limit the light. That is, [we may understand] the source and root of thei r power to limit, which is drawn from the same Essence from which the lights themselves are drawn. 8 For example, the source of t he existence of the light of a desi re is from the concealed ess ential source of all desi res. Now, the potential power to limit is also drawn from there . This limit s the strength of the spread ing forth of the light of the desire, so as not to spread forth further [than desired] . T his is so that the “reasoning for th e desire” could come about . 9 This is because if the power and the light of the desire would not cease, the “reasoning for the desire” c ould never come about . 10   5 That is, this is still the essential potential power to limit of the hand, and is not yet an actual limitation of any specific movement of the hand. 6 For example, although the actual limitation of an actual specific movement is exactly like what was det ermined in the potential power to limit, nonetheless, the two are not comparable. 7 This will be explained in the next chapter, with G - d’s help. 8 In other words, just as the Lights are emanated from the essential desire and Heyulie power of the Essence of G -d to emanate, so likewise, the various limitations of the Vessels are also drawn from the essential potential Heyulie power to limit. Moreover, as explained in chapters ten and eleven, not only are these two powers equal, but they literally are one a nd the same power, except that from the perspective of the source of the Lights, G - d is called “the True Nothing – Ain Ha’Ameetee ”, while from the perspective of the Vessels He is called “the True Something – Yesh Ha’Ameetee ”. 9 This refers to Chochmah of Keter , which is generally called the “hidden reasoning for the desire”, as previously explained. 10 This rule applies not only to the Desire – Keter , and “the Reasoning for the Desire – Chochmah of Keter ” but also to the entire chaining down of the worlds. As mentioned before, the Essential inner light of the sefirot is a completely intangible “nothingness”. In order for this light to be drawn down to a lesser level, self -limitation is necessary. An example of this is when a person has a desire for someth ing. In order for his desire to be conveyed to a recipient, such as the craftsman who will construct the object of his desire, he"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" This is controlled by the Kav HaMidah -The Measuring Line , which makes all the actual limitation s of the lights. In the same manner it makes all the act ual limitations of the vessels of the ten sefirot which limit, and dictates how they will actually limit . 11 However, the ir root and sour ce is not the aspect of true limitation, but rather, it determi nes the type of limita tion . 12 (This comes from the Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line , from the aspect of Gevurah of Ohr Ein Sof - Sternness of the Infinite Light . This is the power to gather in , which is similar the power to spread out, since they are two l ines of equal balance. 13 This is because [being that G- d is] “All Capable” ( Kol Yachol ) [He therefore] also possesses the power to limit (as explained elsewhere). 14 It was explained above 15 that this is the aspect of the Reshimu – Impression, which is the s ource of the limitations of the vessels of the ten sefirot of [the world] of Atzilut . The aspect of the Kav – Line , which is drawn from the Reshimu – Impression , is the source of all the Lights, as is explained elsewhere at length.) Therefore, although t he aspect of the Vessels of [the world of] Atzilut actual ly limit 16 through the aspect of the [four] names A”v, Sa”G , [ Ma”H and Ba”N ] w hich are called “Letters”,       must limit his desire and define it. For example, he must state, “I want a table”. If he does not say, “I want a table” and instead only says “make it for me”, the craftsman cannot make anything. Rather, in order for the light of this desire to be expressed, it must be limited within the “vessels” and “letters” of description, and he must state, “I would like you to make a ta ble for me”. Without this self -imposed limitation, of limiting himself to this specific definition and these specific words, there could be no transition from one level to the next, and no expression of his inner desire to the outside. Rather, only the si mple self - expression of his essence itself could exist. This concept will be discussed later on the subject of the “letters”. 11 This was explained in chapter fifteen. 12 This is to say that the source of the actual limitations is only the potential Heyulie power and ability to Limit. However, this power itself is actually an infinite power, and is not limited whatsoever. Therefore, although the actual limitation is bound to the Heyulie power to limit, nonetheless, the two are of an entirely different cat egory and quality, as explained above. 13 We explained before that the Kav – Line is the intermediary infinite conduct of “HaGadol, HaGibor, V’HaNora ” ( Chessed is the infinite revelation ( Ohr Ein Sof ), Gevurah is the absolute concealment ( Tzimtzum and Reshi mu ) and Tiferet is the Kav - Line, which unites these two absolutes to bring about infinite levels of limited revelation between the two extremes. We see that all three powers are infinite. Here, however, it appears that the Rebbe is calling the Kav – Line, Gevurah of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ). Rather, it must be understood that the Kav - Line bears two properties, the power to reveal and the power to limit. Here the Rebbe is specifically referring to the power of the Kav - Line to limit and measure, whi ch is why it is called Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line. This ability of the Kav - Line to measure and limit, is drawn from the Tzimtzum and Reshimu , which is the power of Gevurah and self -restraint of Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - The Essence of Infinite Light. In contrast, the power to spread forth and reveal of the the Kav - Line, is drawn from the aspect of the revelation of the Infinite Light ( Chessed of the Ohr Ein Sof ). Now, these two lines are literally one power, and are in absolute equalibrium, as was explai ned at length in chapter 15. 14 See Avodat HaKodesh, Section 1, Chapter 8. Also see Derech Emunah (by the same author, Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabai), Chapter 2. 15 See Chapter 13. 16 This is to say that in comparison to the potential Heyulie ability to limit as it i s in the Kav and Reshimu , the vessels of the world of Atzilut are considered to be actual limited vessels. In other words, they actually limit the Lights ( Orot ) of the world of Atzilut by means of the four names (i.e. limiting descriptions) A”v, Sa”G, Ma” H and Ba”N etc. (However, the vessels of Atzilut are only considered to be matters of actual"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"however, this is only due to the potential power to make limitations within the Esse nce of the Emanator [Himself] . 17 This, then, is the meaning of “He and His organs are one”, i.e. that [the Vessels] come about from the power of the Ein Sof - The Infinite One Himself, in the same way that, “He and His life force are one” , in regard to the aspect of the Lights. (H ow ever , in truth, even the aspect of the vessels of the ten sefirot of [the world of] Atzilut are potential limit ation ( Koach HaGvool ) rather than actual limitation ( Gvool B’Po’el ). It is only when the light and influence is limited to [cre ate] “something” from “nothing” in [the worlds of] Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah , tha t they can be considered to be actual limitation ( Gvool B’Po’el Mamash ), as will be explained with the help of G -d. 18 ) According to the above, when one focuses his intention on the names of A”v, Sa”G [etc,] which are in an aspect of vessels which actually limit, this itself [constitutes] focusing his intention upon the source of the names of A”v, Sa”G etc, which are the source of the Light of [the world of] Atzilut . (This is the Essential Name – Shem Ha’Etzem , which indicates the essence of the source, as previously explained.) In other words, [his intention] is [focused] on the source of th e existence of the Vessels, [about which it states] “He and His organs are one” , as explained above . 19 This is because the actual limitation ( Gvool B’Po’el ) is unified with the potential power to limit ( Koach HaGvool ), which brings about this actual limitation. [This       limitation in comparison to the essential Heyulie power to limit. However, as explained before, even the vessels of Atzilut are intangible and are not yet consider ed actual limitation.) 17 In other words, the vessels have a source in the Essence of the Emanator independent of the Lights. They receive their limitations according to the Essential Heyulie ability and desire to Limit, as it is in the Essence of the Infi nite One ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). This is because, as explained above, a Being who is truly infinite also possesses the ability to limit. Nevertheless, His ability to limit is also infinite and in no way limits Him . Rather, G - d’s power to limit is the dir ect source of all limitations throughout the entire chaining down of the worlds. (In other words, there are two separate types of chaining down. There is the chaining down of the lights and the chaining down of the vessels. Now, the substance of the ves sels is literally the same the Heyulie Substance mentioned above and derives its existence directly from there. In contrast, the form ( Tzurah ) and vitality of the vessels is from the aspect of the chaining down of the lights. However, both these aspects are literally rooted in the very Essence of the Infinite Light, and as they relate to Him, they are literally one and the same power, as explained above. This explains why the Zohars states, “He and His organs are one” and “He and His life force are one”, as two separate statements, rather than expressing them as one statement, such as, “He and His organs and life force are one”. This is to teach us that, contrary to what we would have thought from the statement that the vessels come about from the “thicke ning” of the light, we must understand that this only refers to the form of the vessels. However, the substance of the vessels exists independently of the light and receives its existence directly from the Essence of the Emanator just as the light receives its existence directly from the Emanator. 18 That is, even the external “letters” and Vessels of the world of Atzilut are still completely intangible, just as the flash of insight from Chochmah to Binah ( Omek HaMoosag ) is still completely intangible. Rather, they are only the source for the actual “somethingness” and tangibility of the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . Th is was already explained in the preceding chapters, and will be explained further later. 19 In other words, when a person grasps the external vessels of the world of Atzilut , he is grasping the “actual limitation” of the Lights. However, this “actual limitation” is literally exactly according to what was determined in the essential source of the vessels, within the essential Heyul ie ability to limit. This is because although there is no comparison whatsoever between the actual limitation and the potential power of limitation, nonetheless, the actual limitation is literally bound up and connected to its source, which is this abilit y to limit. Moreover, the actual limitation is literally exactly according to the essential desire to limit in this specific manner. In this respect there is no difference between it and the essential desire even to a hair’s breadth, so to speak. Therefo re, the external names of the world of Atzilut are, nevertheless, still considered to be part and parcel of the Essential Name ( Shem HaEtzem )."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"may be understood] by way of analogy, from the potential power to limit of the hand which is unified and bound to the actual limitation of the movement, as mentioned above. (This is most certainly true of the Vessels of the Brain, Heart [and Liver], which cannot yet be considered to be actual limitation ( Gvool B’Po’el ), as ex plained above . Rather, they limit and describe the Li ghts only so that they may be recog nizable as a tangible existence. Nonetheless , the [Vessels] are rooted in the Essence just as the Lights are root ed in the Ess ence. These [two powers] are equal ly bal ance d, and literall y have a single source, that [source being] the aspect of Ein Sof - The Infinite One, lite rally. This is because just as the Infinite Light spreads down [without limit], so too it [exists above] with out end. 20 These [two powers, i.e. th e infinite ability to reve al and the infinite ability to restrain revelation ] are Chessed and Gevurah of the Atzmoot – Kindness and Sternness of the Essence. However, regarding the Li ghts and Vessels [as they are] in their source , it is the reverse of [ho w they are] in their revealed aspect . This is because as they are revealed, the aspect of restraint - Tzimtzum is in the Lights, and the kindnesses of spreading forth, is in the Vessels. This is because even though the [Vessels] limit [the Lights, none theless,] all spreading down [of influence] comes about specifically through the m. H owever, in their source, the opposite is true . The restraint - Tzimtzum is in the Reshimu - Impression, which makes potential limitation, while the spreading forth of kindnesses - Chassadim is in the lights, which comes about from the aspect of the Kav - Line . This is explained elsewhere, and will suffice for those of understanding. 21 End of Chapter Twenty Nine   20 That is, just as G -d can infinitely reveal the Infinite Light ( Chessed ), likewise, He can infinitely contain and withdraw its revelation into Himself ( Gevurah ). 21 In other words, from our perspective as the recipients, the Infinite Light ( Chessed ) is restrained and concealed ( Tzimtzum and Gevurah ), and that which is revealed to us is only comes through the limiting vessels ( Gevurah ). This is to say that to us, the right ( Chessed ) is concealed and is the left ( Gevurah ), is revealed, and, as was explained before, revelation being an expression of Chessed . In contrast, in their source it is the opposite. The right ( Chessed ) is the revelation of the Infinite Light and the left ( Gevurah ) is the Tzimtzum and Reshimu . All of this may be understood through the analogy of two people. When one person stands facing another, to the other person, the right hand is on the left and the left hand is on his right. However, from the angle of the person himself, right is right and left is left."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty From the above we may understand the statement, 1 “If You would withdraw from them , all [the names] would remain as a body without a soul”. This refers to the aspect of the vessels of the Brain, the Heart and [the Liver], which [by themselves] are called “A body without the soul”. [The soul] refers to the aspect of the Lights of the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah etc. However, after having previously stated that the Vessels ( Kelim ) come from the thickening of the Lights ( Orot ), how then is it possib le for there to be a Vessel ( Keli ) without Light ( Ohr )? 2 Rather, according to what was sta ted above 3 that the source of the Vessels ( Kelim ) preceded the source of the Lights ( Orot ), therefore the Vessels have their own existence, independent [of the lights] . Regarding this it states, “He and His organs are one”. 4 (Acc ordingly , a person who di rects his intentions to the name Havayah, such as during the eighteen benediction of the Amidah prayer, should direct his intention to the source of the vessel, which is the main aspect of the name , 5 since “He and His organs are one”. This   1 See Introduction of Tikkunei Zohar 17b. 2 In other words , after having stated that the vessels are made from the thickening of the lights , then at first glance, how is it possible for there to be a Vessel without Light? If this was entirely the case, then with the withdrawal of th e light, the vessel would revert to nothingness. How then does the Zohar state that “they remain as a body without a soul ”? 3 See previous chapter. 4 This is to say that the vessels have a source and power from the Essence of the Infinite One, indepe ndent of the source of the Lights. As explained previously, the source of the vessels is the aspect of the Reshimu which precedes the source of the revelation of line of light - Kav within the chaining down of the worlds. Therefore , there is an independent chaining down specific to the vessels , directly from the aspect of Gevurah of the Infinite Light which is vested within the aspect of the limitations of the Line of Measurement ( Kav HaMidah ). However, as explained in chapters ten and eleven, the power of Gevurah of the Infinite Light is totally bound up with the essence of the Infinite Light, and has no independent existence from Him, whatsoever. That is, “He and His organs”, which are the Vessels of the world of Atzilut , “are one”. Hence, when the Ligh ts of the sefirot are withdrawn from the Vessels, they still remain intact “as a body without a soul”. 5 That is, it was previously explained that when one devotes his intention to the external names of the world of Atzilut, his true intention is actually to the Essential Light of G -d, Himself. This is similar to the fact that when one grasps the depth of a concept he immediately grasps the essential light of the concept. This is also comparable to the matter of names. When one says a name, such as the n ame of a person who he knows well, the thought which is conjured in his mind at the mention of that person’s name, is the external vessel of the light of the essence of the totality of that person, to which his mind literally becomes bound to. Here, howeve r, the Rebbe is making a different point. Here he states that when one devotes his intentions to the external names, his intention should specifically be directed to the source of the vessels , which is the principle aspect of the name. As explained befor e, the source of the vessels is the Reshimu (which is the impression and “engraving” of the essential simple desire of the Essence of the Infinite Light. This essential"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"       desire is, “ Ana Emloch – I Shall Rule”, which is G - d’s desire to have a “dwelling place in the lower worlds” ( Dirah B’Tachtonim ) and is the ultimate purpose of all of Creation. When one reaches the Shemoneh Esreh prayer, his entire intent and desire should be only to fulfill this essential will and desire of G -d. This is to say that when he makes his requests during prayer, such as, “Grace us with wisdom, understanding and knowledge”, “Return us, our Father, to your Torah etc.”, “Forgive us our Father, for we have sinned etc.”, “Redeem us speedily etc.”, “Heal us etc.”, “Bless us HaShem d uring this year etc.”, “Blast the great Shofar of our liberation etc.”, “Return our judges as of yore etc”, “Speedily uproot the dominion of evil etc.”, “Let your mercies please be upon us etc.”, “Return to Jerusalem, your city, with mercy etc.”, “Cause th e plant of you servant David to speedily grow etc.”, “Listen to our voice, HaShem our G - d etc.”, “Return the service to the sanctuary of your house etc.”, his own intention and desire should literally be identical to the ultimate intention and desire of G -d in creating His world, which is to bring about a “dwelling place” for G -d in this physical world. That is, during the Shemoneh Esreh prayer a Jew literally stands before G -d, with true and complete sublimation to Him. At this time, the very essence of h is soul, the Yechidah, is revealed, and therefore his desire and G - d’s desire are literally one. (Because A Jew is totally sublimated and bound up with the Essence of G -d during the Shemoneh Esreh prayer, that it why it begins with the words “ HaShem, you open my lips”, that is, he is so sublimated and nullified to G -d at this point that G - d Himself must “open his lips” and then will, “my mouth speak your praises” etc.) Now, when his desire and G - d’s desire are equal, G -d then grants his request, and He be stows His blessings, influence and beneficence upon the world. (This explains the statement of our sages in Pirkei Avot, “Make His will as your will, so that He will make your will as His will”.) This matter may be further understood as follows: There are several stages in the actualization of any desire. The first stage is the matter of the actual limitation of his desire to a specific desire. This is the original point of the desire and thought for the end action, and arises before any action at al l. Obviously, this is not the end action itself. However, immediately upon the determination of the desire, and the resolve to actualize it, a line of action is immediately drawn forth from this point. This is as previously explained in regard to how th e Kav – the Limited Ray of Light, is drawn from the Reshimu (which is the “letters” of the Essential Desire of G -d) automatically. This line of Light vests within the Vessels which have their source in the Reshimu . The merging of the light with the vessel s constitutes the actualization of the desire and its fulfillment. It therefore follows, that the merging of the light with the final vessel constitutes the actualization and fulfillment of the ultimate desire. An analogy for all of this is that when one desires to move his hand, he does not begin by contemplating how to draw forth the light of his soul so that it should spread forth in movement. Rather, immediately upon the establishment of the end action within his essential desire, the light of his sou l is automatically and instantaneously drawn forth through the entire chaining down to the actualization of the desire, until it is fulfilled in actuality. In the Shemoneh Esreh prayer, because of a Jew’s complete sublimation and nullification to G - d’s will, the essence of his soul, the Yechidah, which is literally bound to G -d, becomes revealed. When this is the case, he shares the same very desire as G -d with every fiber of his being (as explained in Kuntres HaHitpaalut). Therefore, when he requests physical beneficence from the Essence of G -d, his true desire and intention is purely to utilize this beneficence to fulfill the ultimate will of G - d and create a “dwelling place for the Holy One Blessed Be He, below in this physical world”. (This princip le may be applies not only to the Shemoneh Esreh prayer, which was just given as the prime example, but to all the prayers or blessings that a pers on may say throughout the day. Furthermore, this principle may be extended to include all the mitzvot that a person may perform. Ultimately it may even be applied to all permissible matters, such as all of a person’s thought, speech and actions. In such a case it would fall into the category of Kadesh Atzmecha BaMootar Lach - “ Sanctify yourself [even] in matters t hat are permitted to you.) (Now, according to the above explanation, both aspects of devotional intent are absolutely necessary. One must bind himself to the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) from the angle of the Lights and one must al so bind himself to the Essence of the Infinite light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) from the angle of the Vessels. The difference between the two is that the devotional intent into the Essence of the Lights is the act of binding himself to the Essence of G -d, as a n arousal from below to above (which is called Ratzo"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"automatically b rings about that the Light ( Ohr ) is drawn toward the Vessel ( Keli ), since , 6 “I t is the nature of a man to [ pursue the woman] ” . 7 This will suffice for those of understanding.)

The innerness of the Vessels is the aspect of the restriction of the light of ChaBa”D of the Light ( Ohr ). 9 The intermediary aspe ct of the Vessels is the restriction of the ChaGa”T of the Light , 10 and t he externality of the vessels is the limitation of the NeHi”Y 11 of the Light. 12       – Running towards G -d, and is connected to the Chaya level of the soul). In contrast, once he is truly bound up and one with G -d, his desire and G - d’s desire literally become one. Because G - d’s desire is specifically for a dwelling place in this physical world, his desire too is that G -d have a dwelling place in this world. Since G - d’s upper desire and man’s lowers desire are in full agreement, this brings about an arousal from above to below, and the I nfinite Light is drawn down to dwell within Creation, drawing down abundant blessings of Divine Influence and revelation to all the worlds. (This matter is called Shuv – Returning back, to drawn down G -dliness into this world, and is connected to the Yech idah level of the soul). From the above, we see that these two matters are interdependent and that the Ratzo - running to G -d, must precede the Shuv - Returning back . In other words, just as when you mention the name of a person, you must first know him, and understand who and what he is, before you can know his inner wants and desires, likewise, one must first bind himself to the source of the lights before he can bind himself to the source of the vessels. This is also the meaning of the Talmudic statement (T ractate Yevamot 105b) regarding prayer that, “One who prays must direct his eyes down and his heart up”. Furthermore, this is the reason why the contemplation - Hitbonenut of G - d’s unity during the recitation of the Shma must precede the requests for benefic ence during Shemoneh Esreh. 6 See Tractate Kiddushin 2b. 7 This may be understood according to the previous footnote, that as soon as one creates the source of the vessel, the light is immediately drawn forth to actualize it. Here the comparison is in re gard to the nature of a man (light) to pursue the woman (the vessel or recipient). 8 As mentioned before, t here are three general vessels ; the Brain ( ChaBa”D ), the Heart ( ChaGa”T ) and the Liver ( NeHi”Y ). The se three vessels also include subdivision, i.e. nine times nine , equals eighty one particular vessels. Now, each of the eighty one particular vessels possesses a n internal , intermediate and outer aspect . Thus, eighty -one times three, equals two -hundred and forty -three. With the addition of the five k indnesses which spawn growth ( Heh Chassadim HaMagdeelim ) they equal two -hundred and forty - eight limbs. This matter will now be explained fully, throughout the rest of this chapter. In this paragraph the Rebbe is not yet explaining the matter of the inner , intermediate and external aspects of each of the particular vessels. Rather, he is saying that the brain is the general internal vessel which limits the light of ChaBa”D , the heart is the general intermediate vessel which limits the light of ChaGa”T , an d the liver is the general external vessel which limits the light of NeHi”Y . (More particularly though, each of these also possesses three aspects of internal, intermediate and external, as will soon be explained in detail.) 9 This refers to the vessel of the Brain, which is the vessel for ChaBa”D of the Light. 10 This refers to the vessel of the Heart, which is the vessel for ChaGa”T of the Light. 11 This refers to the vessel of the Liver, which is the vessel for NeHi”Y of the Light. 12 In other words, there are three aspects in the Lights , which are ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y . Corresponding to these three general influences of Light there are the three general Vessels; the Brain, the Heart and the Liver. In other words, although the Lights are of the ulti mate in simplicity, there are also the divisions of levels of ChaBa”D, C haGa”T and NeHi”Y in the lights. This may be understood by way of analogy from the sun whose light possesses three levels. The first level is as the light is totally sublimated and included within the essence of the sun . At this point , it is as if it has no existence at all, and it is called the “C oncealment of Light – He’elem Ohr ”. The second level is the aspect of the revelation of the light, in that it is revealed from its concea lment in the essence. Now, this aspect itself has two levels. The first asp ect is how the light radiates as it is, in and of itself . This is called a Revelation of Light – Giluy Ohr ."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"       The second level (which is the third of the three levels) is that sin ce it radiates in and of itself , it therefore also radiates to recipients. This level is called a “Ray – Zeev ” and spreading forth of Light. It is similarly understood that in the spiritual light of the soul there are ten powers which are called “Light s – Orot ”, each of which includes three aspects. The first level, for example, is the aspect of the sublimation of the Light of the power of Chochmah , as it is in the essence of the soul. This is the power of Chochmah as it is absolutely included and emb edded in the very essence of the soul, as explained in chapters ten and eleven . It has no existence separate and apart from the essence of the soul at all. This is called the aspect of ChaBa”D of the Light of Chochmah . The second level is the aspect of the revelation of the Light from the essence. This is the matter of the desire for the desire ( Ratzon L’Ratzon ) of Chochmah , which was explained in chapter twenty eight (and previous chapters). In other words, this is how the Light radiates in and of its elf, and is not yet a revelation of any particular desire, but only a general desire and life force which encompasses the entirety of the one’s life. This is the aspect of ChaGa”T of the light of Chochmah . The third level is the aspect of the revelation, as it is revealed as a particular desire , like a ray ( Zeev ). For instance, this is how each and every day, as a person matures, the aspect of the Chochmah of his soul dwells upon the body in a different manner. This is similar to the explanation above of the verse, “Days speak and years relate wisdom”. This is the aspect of NeHi”Y of the Light of Chochmah . That is, it is the aspect of the revelation of the light as it spreads forth to the recipient, which is the vessel of the body. Now, correspondin g to these three levels in the light there are three aspects in the vessels. (This is because it is from the thickening of the light that the vessels are made. Now, although the source of the vessels is higher than that o f the lights, nevertheless, that is only as they are in a concealed state. However, they can only be reve aled through the aspect of light. This is analogous to a person lighting a candle in a dark house. E verything that is concealed becomes revealed . However , this analogy is not e ntir ely similar to the analogue, since in the analogy the various objects in the house which are revealed are no t actually affected or change d by the radiance of the candle. P rior to their revelation they were physical and subsequent to their revelation they remain physical . However, above, the source of the vessels is from the aspect of the primal c oncealment and darkness called the Reshimu . The Reshimu is in a state of ultimate closeness to the Essence ( Atzmut ) and as the vessels exist in their source (the Reshimu ) they are completely beyond even being a source of influence. However, through the aspect of the light they become revealed in the way of a tangible “something ness”. This is to say that the Reshimu is called the aspect of the “True Something” on ly because it is the source of all “somethingness”, not because it itself is a tangible entity, Heaven forbid.) Now, the three levels of the vessels are the innerness of the vessels, the intermediary aspect of the vessels and the externality of the vess els. However, before these three levels may be explained in a manner of particulars, we must first categorize these three levels generally as follows: The inner aspect of the vessels is the aspect of the Sublimation ( Bitul ) of the Vessel to the Light. T he intermediary aspect of the vessels is the aspect of the revelation and Feeling ( Hergesh ) of that particular Light ( Ohr ), which is brought forth by the general revelation of that Light within the intermediary aspect of the Vessel ( Keli ). The external as pect of the Vessel ( Keli ) is the power of the vessel to spread out ( Hitpashtoot ) influence to that which is below it. This may generally be understood as follows: A ccording to what was explained (in chapter twenty nine), we understan d that in each part icular of the three levels of the vessels there are two aspects. The first is the aspect of the Gevurot - sternness which comes about of their source in the Reshimu . This is the matter of the p ower of the vessel to limit and conceal the light. The secon d, which is the aspect of their ability to reve al influence downward, is the aspect of Chassadim – Kindnesses , and comes from the aspect of the Light of Kav -Line. That is, the vessels bring forth all kinds of influence of light below, to the recipient. According to this, the inner aspect of the vessels is the restraint and limitation of the aspect of ChaBa”D of the light, which is the aspect of the light’s sublimation and inclusion in the luminary. Through this sublimation to the luminary (i.e. the essen ce) there is an automatic drawing forth of the light to the recipient who is sublimated (i.e. the body) . This is the matter of the sublimation of the recipient to the influencer. (A general analogy for this is the sublimation of the limbs of the body to the desire of the soul, in that they act totally according to the soul’s desire. This is brought about by the aspect of the innerness of the vessels, w hich is the matter of the “sinews of feel ing – Geedey Hargasha ”, i.e. the “nerves”, which become"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" This is the meaning of [the verse], 13 “You conceal – Atah Seter ( אתה סתר ) ” . [The word Seter – Conceal ( סתר )] is a backwards spelling of [the acronym ] Rosh – Beginning ( ר אש ), Toch – Middle ( ת וך ), and Sof – End ( ס וף ), 14 because the main restriction and concealment [of the Light] is in the externality of the vessels. 15 Fur thermore , in regard to the matter that the aspect of influence and the lowering of [that] influence to the recipients [comes about] specifically through Vessels ( Kelim ), there also are       reveale d through the aspect of ChaBa”D of the Light (i.e. the light of the Brain) , and the sublimation of the brain to the soul . However, this analogy is only in general. A better analogy for this is that it is specifically through the sublimation of a person ’s intellect to the essential depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ) that the flash of the light of insight is drawn forth into the vessel of his brain, as explained in previous chapters.) The intermedia ry aspect of the vessels limits the aspect of ChaGa”T of the Light. This is the matter of the revelation of the light from the concealment of the soul. Through this, an aspect of revelatio n of light and influence is drawn down to the recipient (i.e. the body). (This is the matter of the Feeling of Vitality – Hargashat HaChayoot , which is found throughout all the limbs of the body. In other words, the previous, more internal level of the vessels is like the sublimation of the body to the essence of the soul. However, this intermediate level is like the gen eral revelation of the life force of the soul throughout the body, which is subsequent to the sublimation of the body to the soul.) The external aspect of the vessels is what limits the aspect of NeHi”Y of the light. This is the matter of the “Ray – Zee v ” and its spreading forth (Hitpashtoot ) to the receptacle of the body . It is in this aspect that the main limitation and concealment takes place. (This is because, as explained above at length , in the essential light there is no change from how it is be fore the Tzimtzum to how it is after the Tzimtzum .) By means of the limitation a particular power is drawn forth to the recipient (i.e. the body). In other words, this is similar to the revelation of a particular power from the general life force and vit ality of the soul. This is the difference between this level and the previous level. For example, it is because of this external aspect of the vessels that it is within the power of the limbs of the body to draw forth the power of move ment into an actual movement. This is the matter of the revelation of their influence to a recipient outside of themselves . In other words, there is now a complete merging of the lights within the vessels and limbs of the body, causing a change of existence from spiritual p otential power of movement to actual physical movement. (However, all of the above is only in general, and the particulars will be explained soon. In other words, the above is actually speaking in regard to the three general Vessels of the Light, which are called the Brain, the Heart and the Liver. However, as will soon be explained in a particular manner, each of these three general vessels also possesses the three aspects of inner, intermediate and external. Moreover, it must be understood that all the above is only an analogy in order to understand this concept below in man. The analogue of how it is in Divine Service or how it is above in G -dliness has yet to be explained.) 13 Psalms 32:7 14 See Emek HaMelech, Shaar 12, Chapter 4. 15 It is clearly un derstood that the greatest restriction of the essential light of the soul is in the most external aspect of the vessels (which is the NeHi”Y or the Liver). This is because the gut emotions ( NeHi”Y ) of the Liver only receive a radiance of light from the He art, which only receives a radiance of light from the Brain, which only receives a radiance of the encompassing life force of the soul. Thus, the external aspect of the vessel of NeHi”Y only receives a radiance of a radiance of a radiance etc. Likewise, as explained before regarding the sefirot of Yosher (about which we are now speaking), the most external action is only the most finite radiance of the essentiality of the soul, and is only a glimmer of a glimmer. In contrast, the heartfelt emotions revea l the essence to a greater degree, and thoughts and desires reveal it even more. Hence, the greatest concealment is in the externality of the Vesse ls, i.e. on the level of action ."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"three levels . 16 The innerness of the vessels is the aspect of bringing [down] of the Light of the i nfluence of ChaBa”D . The Middle [aspect] is the bringing [down] and drawing forth of the Light of ChaGa”T , and the E xternality is the bringing [down] of the influence of NeHi”Y . By way of analogy, [this is like] the nine sefir ot of the Light o f the quality of Chessed – Kindness, as it is limited within three kinds of “letters”. 17 The letters of Thought ( Machshavah ) is the aspect of the inner vessel for the ChaBa”D of Chessed – Kindness. The letters of Speech ( Deeboor ) is the i ntermediary vessel for ChaGa”T of Chessed – Kindness, and the letters of the Action ( Ma’aseh ) is [the outer vessel for] the aspect of NeHi”Y of the Light of Chessed – Kindness. [In other words, this outer vessel] is the power to actualize the kindness, t o do it in actual deed . This [actualization of the kindness] has a vessel specific to it. Likewise, the love of the kindness has a vessel specific to it , and the intellect and reasonin g of the kindness has a vessel specific to it . In most cases, the int ellect and reasoning of the kindness are entertained in one’s Thought ( Machshavah ), the love [of the kindness ] is said in Speech ( Deeboor ) and the power to actualize [the kindness ] is actualized in Deed ( Ma’aseh ). (However, when [the Light of Chessed – Ki ndness ] comes [to actually be expressed] in the three types of Letters ( Otiot ) of Thought, Speech and Action, they are [only] called “Garments – Levooshin ”. This is lower than the aspect of the vessels about which it states   16 In footnote ten of this chapter (and in previous chapters) it was explain ed that there are two aspects in the vessels . The first is the aspect of the Gevurot - Sternness because their source is the Reshimu . This is the matter of the power of the vessels to limit and conceal the light. The second, which is the asp ect of their revelation downward, is the aspect of Chassadim – Kindnesses , which comes from the aspect of the Light of Kav . Tha t is, they bring forth all kinds of influence of light below, to the recipient. This is the inner aspect of the vessel and the outer aspect of the vessel. The matter of how the vessels limit the light has already been explained. The Rebbe will now explain the matter of how the vessels draw the light forth to that which is below them. (These two aspects are the difference between the inner a spect of the three vessels of the Brain, the Heart and the Liver, and the external aspect of the vessels of the Brain, the Heart and the Liver.) 17 This is only an analogy because it refers not to the aspect of the vessels ( Kelim ) but to the aspect of the garments ( Levooshin ). The Rebbe brings a proof for the fact that the vessel of the Brain limits and brings forth the Light of ChaBa”D and that the vessel of the Heart limits and brings forth the light of ChaGa”T and that the vessel of the Liver limits and b rings forth the light of NeHi”Y, from the matter of the three Garments – Levooshim (thought, speech and action) . By way of analogy, this is like the light of Chessed – Kindness. The aspect of ChaBa”D , the intellect of the kindness, generally vests within the letters of thought which is the internal garment. The aspect of ChaGa”T of the kindness , which is the aspect of the emotions of love etc , generally vests within the aspect of speech, which is the intermediary garment. The aspect of NeHi”Y of the kin dness is the power for the actualization of this kindness, to actually do an act of kind ness . This becomes vested within the aspect of the power of the letters of action, which is the most external garment. The same is true of the matter of the vessels , that the light of ChaBa”D is limited and drawn forth into revelation by the internal aspect of the vessels which is the Brain. The light of ChaGa”T is limited and drawn forth by the intermediary aspect of the vessels which is the Heart. The l ight of Ne Hi”Y is limited and drawn forth by the external aspect of the vessels , which is the vessel of the Liver . Nevertheless, there is a great difference between the aspect of Vessels ( Kelim ) and Garments ( Levushim ), as will be explained later in chapter thirty -eight. "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"“He and His organs are one” , wh ich is not the case with the Garments - Levooshin . 18 Rather, [this statement] refers to the Vessels ( Kelim ) for the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah , which are the Brain, the Heart [and the Liver]. 19   18 The difference between the two will be explained in chapter thirty eight and thirty nine at length. 19 In the next paragraph the Rebbe begins to explain the particulars of the vessels. However, because he previously explained the internal, interm ediate and external aspects of the intellectual sefirot of Chochmah, Binah and Da’at of the vessel of t he Brain, he skips to explain the vessel of the Heart. For the sake of clarity, however, we will explain these three aspects of the intellectual sefirot as follows: Chochmah is the aspect of the beginning of the revelation of the soul in a way of “something from nothing” ( Yesh Me’E in ). This is to say that it is the depth and point of the intellect, which dwells upon and vests within the right hemisphe re of the brain. There are three as pects in this: The first is the concealed depth of Chochmah which is not revealed or invested within the vessel of the brain at all, even for the brain itself. (This is in accordance with what was previously stated reg arding the ma tter of “Rav was silent” but could not acknowledge the position of his opponents. This is because he felt the essential depth of the matter with his intellect, and ruled on that particular matter accordingly. Nevertheless, he was unable to b ring this intellectual matter to vest in an aspect of letters, to respond to his opponents. This is because the matter was not revealed to him in a way of the rev elation of light.) This is the aspect of the light of Chochmah as it is in the inner vessel of the brain. The second level is the revelation of the Chochmah in a way that it dwells within the vessel of the brain. This is what is called the flash of insight, which comes about through the merging of the light of Chochmah within its intermediary vessel. The third leve l is the fact that the essential intellect has the po wer to bring forth comprehend ible explanations which , in and of themselves, are separate from the essence of the matter. This is the aforementioned matter of “Be underst anding in wisdom etc”. (This also explains the concept of the “upper thorn, the middle body and the lower thorn of the letter Yud - י .) This power of “understand in wisdom” comes about because the light of Chochmah dwells within the externality of the vessel of the right hemisphere of the brain. The above expl ains the aspects of the inner , intermediary and external levels of the ve ssel of Chochmah . This is the matter of the beginning, middle and end of the vessel of Chochmah (which was previously called the depth, width , and length of Chochmah ). Now, the same is likewise true of the left hemisphere of the brain , within which the light of the soul becomes invested to bring forth new comprehensions. T hat is, this is the investment of the essence of the concept in to many dif ferent explanations, and is called Binah . Now, there are also three aspects i n the vessel of Binah : There i s the depth of the comprehension which unifies with the depth of Chochmah . (This is in accordance with what was explained previously, that “ Abba and Imma dwell as one”.) This is called the “point of the comprehension and reasoning” ( Omek HaMoosag ). Now, the revelation of the explanation in an aspect of “letters” is the intermediary aspect of the vessel of Binah , whereas t he po wer of the comprehension to arrive at an actual leaning towards either kindness or judgment , is the external aspect of the vessel of Binah . The se are the inner , intermediary, and external aspects of the vessel of Binah and are similar to what was said regarding the aspect of Chochmah (i.e. that these correspond to length, width and depth of Binah ). This is likewise the case in re gard to the aspect of Da’at , which is the light of the soul as it becomes vested within the vessel of the brain when one leans their head back wards. In other words, Da’at is the matter of memory. (As is known, Da’at is the aspect of the connection to the comprehension or concept, and generally, the strength of the memory is according to this connection.) In Da’at there are also three aspects ; inner, middle and external: The depth of Da’at is the matter of the connection to the essential depth of the com prehension or the depth of the concept, as the concept is before it vests within the aspect of “le tters”. This is the innerness of the vessel of Da’at . The second level i s the aspect of the width of Da’at , which is the intermediate aspect of the vessel o f Da’at . This is the matter of the intellectual connection to the length and width of the comprehended concept and explanation, that is, to the particulars of the concept"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" Now, in the [vessel of the] Heart ther e are [also] three level s; inner, middle and outer, corresponding to the nine sefirot . 20 There is the aspect of ChaBa”D of the emotional qualities of love or fear, which is called the “Intellect of the Emotions” ( Mooskal Shel HaMeedot ). This is in the right ventricle of the hear t, within wh ich light radiates from the brain of Chochmah which rules over the heart. 21 The ChaGa”T of the love and fear is called the “Feeling” ( Moorgash ). This is the aspect of the intermediary vessel of the heart, which is the Spirit of Life ( Ruach HaC hayim ) which beats in the left ventricle. This is drawn from the brain of Binah which is called “ Ruach ”. 22 This is the aspect of the vessel of the felt vitality of the emotions, when they become aroused. 23       and its “letters”. The third level is the aspect of the connection to the entirety of the comprehension or concept, to actually bring forth emotions or action. This is the externality of the vessel of Da’at . All the above explains the three powers of ChaBa”D (or the general level of Neshamah ) which dwell s within the general vessel of t he Brain, and h ow each one includes an inner , intermediate and external aspect. In other words, each one possesses the inner sublimation ( Bitul ), the feeling and somethingness ( Moorgash ), and the spreading forth to below ( Hitpashtoot ). 20 The Rebbe now beg ins to explain the aspect of the vessel of the Heart, which includes the three emotional sefirot of ChaGa”T for which it is the vessel . These emotional sefirot are the heartfelt emotions of attraction or love, repulsion or hate and the intermedi ate compos ite of the two , which is mercy. In other words, the matter of mercy is that even though it may be fitting to hate and be repulsed by such and such a person, nonetheless, because of the aspect of m ercy he will actually act kindly and with goodness to ward him. These three general levels become merged within the vessel of the Heart. Now, in the vessel of the heart there are also three aspects of inner ( ChaBa”D of the Heart), intermediate ( ChaGa”T of the Heart) and external ( NeHi”Y of the Heart). These will now be explained in a particular manner. 21 The first aspect of the Heart is in the right ventricle, which is the dw elling place for the innerness and depth of these three emotions (of ChaGa”T ), and is their main essence. It is clearly observable that imm ediately upon a person’s conceptualization of something as good and de sirable, a power is aroused in his heart which draws his emotions towards this good and desirable thing. This d rawing of the heart towards the desirable thing is aroused immediately upo n his conceptualization of it . It is therefore clear that it becomes one with the intellect, and is not separate from it at all. This is the matter of the investment of the soul in to the aspect of the innerness of the vessel of the heart, which is the ri ght ventricle as mentioned above. (Likewise, the same is true of the opposite emotional power which draws the heart to be repulsed, or the intermediate emotional power which draws the heart to be merciful.) We find that the essential light of the intelle ct, which is drawn from the brain of Chochmah (i.e. the intuition towards the thing) , radiates within the aspect of the innerness of the e motions. In other words, the “B rain of Chochmah rules over the heart” and therefor e, the emotions of the heart respon d entirely according to the dictates of the intel lect, and cannot stray from it even in the slightest way . This is the aspect of ChaBa”D of the emotions, in the right ventricle of the Heart. In other words, this is the inner aspect of the heart, which is the sublimation ( Bitul ) of the heart to the brain. In other words this is the sublimation of the emotions to the intellect, which encompasses the emotions from above. 22 Isaiah 29:24; See also Tanya, Chapters 5, 9 and 16. 23 The second (intermediate) level of the vessel of the heart is the aspect of how the light of the emotions become merged within the left ventricle of the heart, which is the dwelling place of the “Spirit of Life – Ruach HaChayim ” of the heart. This refers to the life force, as it is befo re it vests within the blood (which is the aspect of the Nefesh , as will soon be explained). Rather, it encompasses and rests upon the blood, but does not yet completely vest within the blood. It is in this intermediate vessel of the heart that the emoti ons become merged in the heart in a completely felt way ( Moorgash ). That is, this is the matter of the felt arousal of the emotions of love or hate etc, which is influenced by the brain of Binah , which is called “ Ruach ”. This is the somethingness of the emotions of the heart itself (the Moorgash ). (The essence of the emotions comes from the aspect of Chochmah . However, the feeling and excitement of the emotions comes from the aspect of Binah . This is similar to a newborn infant. That is, the essen ce of the infant comes from the seminal drop of the father ( Abba ). Nonetheless, the spreading for th and development of this"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" The externality of the heart is the “Breath of th e Chest” ( Havel HaChazeh ), which is the vessel for the natural [reactions] of the emotions. This corresponds to the aspect of Nefesh , i.e. the aspect of NeHi”Y of the [heartfelt] emotions. It is this [level] which radiates into the Nefesh which is “in th e blood”, which, generally , is a vehicle for the Ruach of the heart. 24 Likewise, the aspect of the Nefesh in the Liver includes three le vels ; inner, middle and outer etc. 25 The Zohar calls the inner [level] , “The Impression of Life – Keesta D’Chayoota ”. T his refers to the aspect of the impression ( Reshimoo ) which remains of the aspect of the Ruach during sleep. This is the aspect of the intellect of ChaBa”D in their immature state ( Katnoot ), [as they are] in the Nefesh . 26       infant into two hundred and forty eight distinct limbs and organs takes place in the womb of the mother ( Imma ), and comes from her, as is known.) This arousal of the emotions comes from the unification o f the innerness of Chochmah and Binah (which is the level of a Chacham - wise man , as previously explained.) 24 The third and most external level of the emotions is the aspect of the natural r eactions of the emotions which become merged with the externality of the vessel of the heart. This is the matter of the “Breath of the Chest – Havel HaChazeh ”, which is the aspect of the sefirot NeHi”Y of the emotions . In other words, it is from this asp ect of the heart that the actual investment of the heartfelt emotions within the blood comes about, i.e. th e physical responses of the body (such as rapid heart beat, hyperventilation or an adrenaline rush etc.). These are called the “Natural Emotions – Meedot Teeviyot ” of the aspect of the Nefesh in the liver, as will be explained. The power which brings these natural responses forth is in the breath of the chest. (The Nefesh in the liver is a vehicle to bring forth the emotions of the heart, which is t he general Ruach of the heart .) In other words, this is similar to the nature of a child to flee from danger because it opposes the life force of his soul which he feels in his heart. In other words, this is the external aspect of the heart, which is the spreading forth of the emotions of the heart ( Hitpashtoot ) to that which is below the heartfelt emotions. (All of the above regarding the heart explains the inner, intermediate and external aspects of the general vessel of the heart, which is the seat of the general Ruach .) 25 The third general level is the aspect of the Nefesh in the Liver. It too includes the three a forementioned levels of inner , intermediate and ex ternal: The liver is the aspect of the vessel for the gut emotions of NeHi”Y which come into revelation from the aspect of the Heart. That is, the heartfelt emotions vest within the b lood of the liver, to bring the arousal toward something into action, such as actually flee ing from danger, or actually draw ing oneself close to something desir able , as mentioned above. This is the meaning of NeHi”Y ( Netzach, Hod and Yesod ). Netzach is the attribute of conquest, which is the great strength in this quality to bring a matter into actuality. This comes from the concealed intellect and emotions, since Netzach is a branch of Chessed which is a branch of Chochmah etc, as previously explained. Likewise, Hod, which shares the same grammatical root as Hoda’ah – Submission, is the aspect of sublimation which comes out in actuality. In other words, al though the intellect and emotions become completely concealed, nevertheless, the action will be sublimated to the matter, coming forth literally exactly according to the dictates of the intellect. In other words, although the intellect is completely conce aled relative to the action, nevertheless, the intellect radiates within the action in a wa y of “a glimmer of a glimmer” . The sefirah of Yesod is the aspect of the connection to the actua lization of the matter . (In contrast, Da’at is the intellectual con nection to the subject matter and the concept.) Now, generally speaking, these three attributes are called the “emotions of action” (or the gut emotions which compel one to act upon his heartfelt feelings ), and they become merged within the vessel of th e liver. In other words, this is the aspect of natural response to the heartfelt emotions which dwell within the intermediate vessel of the heart, which is the left ventricle that receives from the light of Binah , as previously explained. 26 The innerness of the vessel of the Liver is what is called by the Zohar the “Impressi on of Life”. This is the impressi on which remains from the Ruach (i.e. the left ventricle of the heart) during sleep. Within this impression there is also a radiance from the aspect o f ChaBa”D of the soul, except that it is called"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" The middle [aspect of the Nefesh in the Liver] is the arousal of the physical life force of the power of movement and feeling which is in the blood , “which is the Nefesh ” , such as the pulse of the hand. The outer [aspect of the Nefesh ] is the aspect of NeHi”Y of the Liver , which sends th e external life force to all of the limbs. 27 Now, the inner [aspects, may become] separated , as explained elsewhere at length . 28 [This is to say] that during the time of exile which is called “sleep”, the radiance of Malchut of Atzilut       ChaBa”D D’Katnoot – The Immature ChaBa”D . (This is evidences from the fact that the letters of thought radiate during the time of sleep, and as is known, the letters of thought are aroused by the Chochmah an d Binah of the soul. This is the matter of dreams. Nevertheless, in the dreams, the letters are not in their correct order, because the proper ordering of t he letters is a function of the revealed intellect which radiates within them. However, during sl eep the intellect is generally w ithdrawn and only radiates in a diminished and “immature” manner. This is why dreams are generally confused. Never theless, there is still a tiny radian ce of the intellect within the letters of dreams, as can be discerned by the fact that dreams may be interp reted.) Now, this phenomenon likewise exists during the waking state. That is, when one does an action, the radiance of t he intellect and the emotions must withdraw , so that only an impression of the intellect remains revealed . (Furthermore, in the action, the impression of the intellect is not r eceived directly from the brain. Rather, only a glimmer of the intellect which radiates within the emotions is transferred to the action . Thus, the intellect of the action (i. e. ChaBa”D of NeHi”Y ) only receives a glimmer of a glimmer of the intellect. (This is in accordance to the Talmudic dictum that, “At night, one will only dream about that which he thought in his heart during the day”. In other words, he will dream about things which his heart became aroused by during the day, (which is only because of that which he thought about in his brain. From this it is understood that although the liver receives a glimmer of intellect from the brain, nonetheless, generally, it is only through the intermediary of the heart.) This explains the inner aspect of the Liver, which is the aspect of the sublimation ( Bitul ) of the gut emotion which leads to actions ( NeHi”Y ), to that which is above the gut emotions, namely, the heartfelt em otions and the intellect. 27 The middle aspect of the vessel of the liver is the felt arousal in the action. In other words, this is the sense of feeling and vitality in the blood itself, within which the Nefesh vests. That is, he feels the arousal whic h spreads forth within his blood , in the heighten ing of his blood pressure or a quickening of his pulse. (We can clearly o bserve that when one performs an act with a great arousal of emotion, there is much greater vitality to his actions. In contrast, wh en he performs an act with out much emotional arous al, there is diminished vitality to his actions.) This explains the intermediate aspect of the heart, which is the feeling ( Moorgash ) of actual vitality (i.e. ChaGa”T of NeHi”Y ). The external aspect of th e vessel of the liver is the aspect of NeHi”Y of the liver (i.e. NeHi”Y of NeHi”Y ), which is the actual spreading forth of the external life force a nd vitality throughout all of the limbs and organs . 28 In order to understand this statement, and the rest of this paragraph, it is necessary to first understand the explanation of the various levels of the soul according to their states o f arousal in the service of G -d, which is Hitbonenut – Contemplation. This may be generally understood in accordance with the previous explanations of the various levels of the soul and their vestment within the various organs of the body. There are three general vessels: the Brain, the Heart and the Liver. These are vessels for the general inner lights of the soul which ves t within the vessels. The inner lights of the soul are called (in ascending order) Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah . Now, the Nefesh which vests in the Liver also possesses three levels, i.e. three inner lights. That is, in the general soul of the Nefesh ther e are also three levels of Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah : The Nefesh of the Nefesh is the actual spreading forth of vitality throughout all of the limbs and organs of the body and the spreading forth of the external vitality in the actual performance of the Mit zvot - commandments of G -d ( Hitpashtoot ). The Ruach of the Nefesh is the feeling of vitality, i.e. the blood pressure and pulse of the blood, in the performance of the Mitzvot - commandments ( Moorgash ). The"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"       Neshamah of the Nefesh is the “impression of life - Keesta D’Chayoota ”, and the sublimation of the gut emotions of the Liver to the arousal of the Heart towards G -d and His Mitzvot - commandments ( Bitul ). (The encompassing light of the Chayah of the Liver ( Nefesh ) is the aspect of the “breath of the chest” ( Havel HaChazeh ) from which it directly receives the “impression” of the emotions of the Heart towards G-d.) Likewise, the Ruach which vests within the Heart also possesses three pervading lights: The Nefesh of the Ruach is the “breath of the chest” ( Ha vel HaChazeh ), and the natural arousal of the emotions towards G -d and his Mitzvot - commandments, which spreads forth into the level below it ( Hitpashtoot ), into the gut emotions which compel one to act upon this arousal, as mentioned above. The Ruach of t he Ruach is the actual arousal of the heartfelt emotions of love and fear towards G -d, which takes place in the left ventricle of the heart in a way of complete arousal and feeling ( Moorgash ). The Neshamah of the Ruach is the sublimation of the Heart to t he Brain ( Bitul ), so that this arousal is only according to the dictates of the intellect. (This level of Neshamah of Ruach receives from the aspect of the Chayah of the Ruach , which is the spreading forth of the intellect to the Heart (as explained in pr evious chapters).) Now, the Neshamah which vests in the Brain likewise possesses three pervading lights of Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah . The Nefesh of the Neshamah is how the intellectual comprehension of G -dliness spreads forth to arouse the emotions of the heart towards G -d, or to be applied in actuality in action ( Hitpashtoot ). The Ruach of the Neshamah is the actual comprehension of the letters of the explanation of the G -dly matter itself, in a tangible fashion ( Moorgash ). The Neshamah of the Nesha mah is the inner aspect of the intellect, and its sublimation to the depth of the comprehension of the G -dly matter ( Bitul ). (The Chayah is the intellectual sight of the mind’s eye, as one perceives the essential ray of G -dliness and the Truth of the G-dl y concept. This itself does not directly vest within the intellect, but only “hovers” over the intellect, in an encompassing manner.) Now, it is possible that the inner aspect of the soul, such as the sublimation of the mind or the arousal of the heart etc, can become withdrawn and separated into their source. That is, they do not radiate within the vessels of the Brain, the Heart and the Liver. For example, as understood from all of the above, there are different levels of arousal towards G -d and His Mitzvot - commandments. The lowest level of radiance, which is the initial radiance of the soul into the body, as will be discussed momentarily in greater detail, is called a “sleep state” or “the state of the fetus” in its mother’s womb. During sleep, th e upper levels of the soul, such as the Neshamah and the Ruach are withdrawn. This is to say that the intellect and emotions do not radiate in a revealed way within the vessels of the brain, and the heart. That is, they only encompass and “hover” over th e vessel of the body. Rather, all that remains revealed within the vessel of the body is an impression of life ( Kista D’Chayoota ) which is only an impression of the general life force of the soul. This is an impression which remains from the fleeting tho ughts of the heart which one had during the day. However, even here, because the intellect does not radiate within the vessels in a revealed manner, these thoughts are all jumbled and confused. This is the source of dreams. (In other words, the Neshama h of Nefesh which is the ChaBa”D of NeHi”Y is also not revealed, but rather, only the Nefesh of Nefesh or NeHi”Y of NeHi”Y is actually revealed. (This matter, which is known as the confusion of the letters, will be explained at great detail in later chapt ers.) During the dream state, because the intellect is withdrawn, the nature of reality is concealed and all that remains is a confusion of the reality of the day. Below in man, this is the level of the soul which is normally revealed, before he has do ne deep Hitbonenut - contemplation into the truth of reality, i.e. G - d. Because of this, his “reality” is only a confusion of True Reality, of which he may be altogether unaware. He does not perceive the true reality of G- d’s existence, but, instead, is in a confused state of reality. Such a person is compared to a child in its mother’s womb, who has not yet been born into the reality of the world. (The ramifications of this in the Upper Worlds will soon be discussed.) The next level of the soul which ma y become revealed and drawn forth through Hitbonenut contemplation is also the same level of Nefesh . However, when it is aroused through Hitbonenut – Contemplation, it is already comparable to be the beginnings of a waking state. That is, because the int ellect is no longer entirely absent, and he does indeed contemplate matters of G -dliness, to understand them, although the entire Truth of G - d’s Singularity is still concealed and far removed from"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"       Him. Nevertheless, he recognizes the absolute truth of the teachings of Chassidus and Kabbalah, and recognizes the lowliness of worldly matters, and is therefore motivated to action ( Nefesh ), to come close to G-d through the performance of the Mitzvot - commandments. Nonetheless, he has not actually attained any rev elation of G -dliness yet, and this is still not even a level of actual heartfelt love and fear of G -d ( Ruach ). Rather, it is the inspiration that leads him to act on his convictions, through desisting from evil and fulfilling the positive commandments. Th e gauge of how much of this level of the soul is revealed is the strength of his commitment to G -d and the fulfillment of His commandments, specifically in action. (See explanation of “Cold Thought” in part three of “The Knowledge of G - d”.) The next le vel of the soul which becomes revealed through the toil of contemplation - Hitbonenut into G -dly matters is the level of the soul called Ruach , which is the heartfelt arousal of love and fear of G -d and His Mitzvot - commandments. In the previous level of Nef esh , although he is motivated to act and fulfill the commandments, it is not like something which is directly relevant and personal to him. Rather, he only recognizes that this is the good and proper thing to do, and resolves with a full commitment to ful fill the commandments in actuality. In this second level, however, the arousal is a heartfelt arousal, like a person’s arousal and investment upon hearing good news of a personal nature. For example, when a person hears good or bad news regarding his bus iness, he is aroused towards action with a personal interest, investment and involvement. Likewise, when one contemplates matters of G -dliness, this level of Ruach of his soul may become aroused. That is, his performance of the commandments and investmen t into matters of G - dliness become a personal matter for him, and therefore his heart actually becomes aroused to fulfill the commandments. This too, however, is only called love and fear which is related to action, and also is still not an actual revelat ion of G - d’s absolute Truth and Singularity. Rather, the difference between this level and the previous level is only that the arousal of the Nefesh is called a “cold thought” which is still not a personal matter, while the Ruach is called a “good thought ” because the fulfillment of the commandments is now a personal matter for him. The third level of arousal is the revelation of the Neshamah of the soul. Here, he comprehends the explanation of matters of G -dliness (such as the upper unity or the lower unity) and his heart actually becomes aroused with actual love and fear of G -d. (This is similar to the first level of Simcha – Joy as explained in chapter six.) However, this arousal is only from the external garments of the tangible explanations which he comprehends, and the ramifications of the “therefore” ( Tamtzit ) which comes out of these explanations. However, he does not grasp the essential G -dliness and Truth of the depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ). Nevertheless, the revelation of this leve l of the soul through contemplation of Chassidus and Kabbalah and the comprehension thereof results in an actual arousal of the heartfelt emotions of love and fear of G -d. This is the level of the Neshamah of the Brain. The next level of the soul which may become revealed through the toil of contemplation ( Hitbonenut ) is the Chayah of the soul, which is the lower of the two encompassing lights of the soul. This is the aspect of the sight of the mind’s eye into the actual depth and G -dliness of the G -dly matter which he contemplates. That is, he sees the essential truth of the matter, and it immediately expands in his mind and heart into abundant explanations (even into different matters). This is not the case with the previous level where he does not see the depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ) but only becomes aroused by the “therefore” ( Tamzit ) of the explanation. (The difference between the Tamtzit and the Omek Hamoosag may be understood as follows: There are two types of essence s. For example, “essence of mint” is not its true essence, but is rather what remains after it has been thoroughly processed until only its essential oil remains. This is the Tamtzit. In the same way, the Tamtzit of a concept is the “Therefore”, which follows the thoroug h processing of the concept through Hitbonenut - contemplation. This “therefore” is very potent, and can arouse very strong heartfelt emotions towards G -d. However, the true essence of mint is the actual source of the mint itself , which brings it into exi stence . This is similar to the Omek Hamoosag – the actual depth of the concept . The Omek Hamoosag is the very depth and source of the c oncept itself. O ne who grasps the Omek Hamoosag, which is its very essence and source, has a radically different exper ience , which will now be explained further)."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"[which is ] the aspec t of the soul of the worlds of BY”A , is only in an aspect of an “Impression of Life – Keesta D’Chayoota ”. 29 [It is only] an impression - Reshimoo of the aspect       When one’s heart becomes excited through his Hitbonenut and his emotions are completely aroused, either with great longing, joy or bitterness etc., the entire length and breadth of the G -dly matter which he wa s contemplating becomes shortened during the actual emotional response. Just an impression of the contemplation remains, as it relates to the excitement and arousal of his emotions only. The length and breadth of the contemplation, recedes and becomes co ncealed from consciousness. He is only left with what is called a “ Tamtzit ” (The final essential conclusion), which is the “Therefore” that follows the contemplation. It is t he recognition of the truth of the “therefore” that causes the excitement and ar ousal of his heart. (This is also the explanation of the verse in Genesis, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother etc”. We explained earlier that “father and mother” refers to the Intellectual faculties of Chochmah and Binah . The word “man – Ish ” refers to Zeir Anpin , i.e. the emotions of the heart.) In contrast, w hen one’s excitement and arousal is caused by the actual essence of the wisdom, the Omek Hamoosag , which is the very depth and essence of the concept, the very opposite of th e above is true. Instead of the intellect receding and becoming “shortened” during the arousal of the emotions, it actually expands due to the arousal of the emotions of the heart. The arousal of the emotions does not become separated from the intellect, as in the previous level, but on the contrary, it actually strengthens the contemplation and is bound up with the comprehension. This is because the very depths of his mind, heart and soul are completely involved and engrossed in the matter under contempl ation. (As explained before, this is the aspect of the sublimation of the entirety of one’s being, and his complete self -investment in the depth of the G -dly matter which he contemplates.) This, then, is the difference between the revelation of the Nesha mah of the soul, and the level of Chayah . Now, the next level of the soul which may become revealed is the level of the Yechidah . This is the revelation of the essence of the soul, as it is literally bound up with G -d, prior to the limitation of His li ght to vest within Creation. (This aspect is the third and greatest level of arousal which is discussed in chapter six, and is explained at greater length in Kuntres HaHitpaalut and in part three of “The Knowledge of G- d”.) In any case, from all the above, it is understood that the inner levels of the soul may become separated, so that all that remains is just the lowest form of an “impression of life force - Kista D’Chayoota ” which vitalizes him during his “sleep” state. This state of sleep, in wh ich the inner levels of the soul are concealed, shall now be discussed at greater length. Also, the analogue of everything that was said above in regard to a human being on this physical plane, shall now be explained regarding how it is Above, in the real m of G - dliness. (The stages of the “growth” of Zeir Anpin will be discussed later at greater length.) 29 Now, everything that was explained above regarding the lights (soul) and vessels (body) of human beings is only an allegory in order to understand the lights and vessels of the world of Atzilut - Emanation, above in the realm of G -dliness. As explained before, in the world of Atzilut there are also three vessels: the “Brain”, the “Heart” and the “Liver”, which are the source of influence to the created worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . (These three created worlds correspond to the garments of Thought, Speech and Action, as will be explained later.) These three general vessels are called the “Body of the King” ( Goofa D’Malka ), which is the vessel for the Lights of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . (However, the “Body of the King” is still entirely bound up with the very essence of G - d, as was explained before in regard to “He and His organs are one”.) Now, in the vessels of Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzi lut there are ten sefirot , which are the vessels for the ten sefirot of the Lights of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . These are divided into three categories: There is the “Brain” which is the vessel which limits the light of ChaBa”D . There is the “Heart” which limits the Light of ChaGa”T , and there is the “Liver” which limits the Light of NeHi”Y . Now, each of these three categories also possesses three general aspects. There is the internal aspect of the vessels, which is the sublimation of the vessels to the light. This was previously compared to how the body is sublimated to the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"       soul. Similarly, the inner aspect of the “Body” and vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut is the aspect of the essential sublimation of the vessels to the G -dly Light which vests within them. This is the inner aspect of the vessels and is the aspect of Bitul – Sublimation, mentioned previously. (We have already explained that even the most external level of the vessels of the world of Atzilut, is still intangible and totally bound with the Essence of G - d.) The intermediate aspect of the “Body” and vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut is the aspect of how the light of Zeir Anpin actually merges within the vessels, and was compared above to the general feeling of vitality within the body of a human being. This is the aspect of Moorgash – Feeling, as explained above. The externality of the general vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut is the aspect of how this vitality spreads forth ( Hitpashtoot ) to that which is “outside”, which are the created w orlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . This is compared to the aspect of the spreading forth of a person’s intellect into the garment of thought, or his emotions into the garment of speech, or his gut emotions into the garment of action. (The difference be tween vessels, which are bound up with the Essence, and garments, which are not, will be explained later.) This is the external aspect of the vessels of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , which brings the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah into actual existence. Now, all of this is only in general, for, as understood from the analogy of man, each of these three categories also divides into three categories (and more etc). Thus, we now understand the general matter of the general lights (soul) and vessels (body) of the world of Atzilut . However, each of these three categories also possesses three levels: inner, intermediate and external. For example, the Nefesh of the world of Atzilut also possesses three levels of Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah (and two encompa ssing lights of Chayah and Yechidah ), as was previously explained in the analogy of man below. That is, the Neshamah of the Nefesh of the vessel of the “Liver” of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut is the aspect of the “impression of life” ( Kista D’Chayoota ), which is the impression of G -dliness which is passed over from the Ruach of Atzilut . This then descends within the Ruach of the Nefesh which is the feeling of vitality within the “blood”, which is the seat of the life force (and was previously compared to the v itality of the pulse and blood pressure when performing an action). This is like the feeling of vitality within the creation of the worlds. This is to say that the worlds may be created with a great investment and revelation of their Life Force (which is G - d), or they can be created with a diminished life force and vitality, like one who performs an action by rote, as previously explained. The third level of Nefesh of Nefesh of Atzilut is the aspect of the actual spreading forth of the life force (G - dliness) and vitality in the actual creation. (The rest of the levels of the “soul” (i.e. Lights) and “body” (i.e. Vessels) of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut may be understood according to the analogy of man as well.) Now, during exile - Galut , the soul (lights) of the vessels of the world of Atzilut (which is called the Shechinah – the Indwelling Divine Presence) which descends, creates, vitalizes and reveals G -dliness within the created realms in an inner manner, is in a diminished state of “sleep”. That is to say, because the light of the intellectual and emotional sefirot is withdrawn from the vessels, all that remains is an “impression” of the Light of G -d. Moreover, this does not mean that the light of the intellectual sefirot radiates in a diminished capa city (as explained before), but rather, that because the light of the intellect is actually withdrawn from the vessels, the impression that remains in the “Liver” is in a state of confusion, like a confused dream, as explained above. This is to say that t he Truth of Reality is completely concealed throughout all of the created worlds, and the awareness of G -d is in completely confused and not actually revealed. However, it is just as when a person sleeps. Although he is not aware of reality, nonetheless , reality is still there, and he still receives vitality and life force from his soul, in a concealed way. In other words, there is only a diminished revelation of the light of his soul in an inner manner, whereas the greater portions of his soul only rad iate in an encompassing manner. Likewise, during the “sleep” state of the exile - Galut , the worlds still receive their vitality and existence from G -d, but only in a very concealed manner, in which there is only a very diminished inner Light of G -d within Creation. However, the worlds are still entirely sublimated to G - d, and His Light still “hovers” over Creation in an encompassing manner, without actually"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"of Ruach of the Heart of the “Upper Man - Adam HaElyon ”. [This is because] during the exile the Asse mbly of Israel 30 is compared to a fetus . In other words, they are similar a fetus whose head is folded between its kn ees, “three inside of three”. [This is to say] that t he Brains of ChaBa”D are concealed within ChaGa”T, and ChaGat is [concealed] within N eHi”Y , as stated elsewhere. 31 ) Now, regarding the matter of the Commandments ( Mitzvot ), which are called the two - hundred an d forty -eight limbs of the King , as is known , three times nine times nine, corresponding to the three levels of beginning, middle and end of the vessels, equals two - hundred and forty -three, as previously mentioned . 32 [Now], w ith the inclusion of the five kindness es which bring about growth , they are two -hundred and forty -eight. 33       being revealed within Creation. All this can change by returning the aspect of Intellect into the performance of the Mitzvot - commandments, through the toil of Hitbonenut – Contemplation (as has been explained, and as will be explained further in the explanation of the five kindness which draw forth the encompassing lights to pervade within the “body” of Creation.) 30 The “Assembly of Israel” ( Knesset Yisrael ) refers to the aspect of the General G -dly Soul of the Jewish People, where all the Jewish souls converge as one, and is another name for the aspect of the Divine Presence ( Shechinah ). 31 In other wor ds, during the exile - Galut (which is called the exile of the Divine Presence – Galut HaShechinah ) there is only a glimmer of a glimmer of the revelation of the True Reality of G -d. This is because of the withdrawal of the Light of the intellectual sefirot (as will be explained at length later, with the explanation of the “sleep of Zeir Anpin – Durmita D’Zeir Anpin ” ). This is to say that there only is a greatly diminished light of ChaBa”D which is concealed within ChaGa”T , which, in turn, only radiates in a greatly diminished manner within NeHi”Y . This is similar to a “fetus” or one who is sleeping (in the fetal position etc.) in which his head is folded into his chest, which is between his knees. Thus, all that is revealed is only an extremely diminished state of awareness (which is in a state of confusion similar to a dream), of only NeHi”Y of NeHi”Y (i.e. the Nefesh of the Nefesh ). (Nevertheless, even a fetus possesses all two hundred and forty eight limbs mentioned above, except that they are very “ti ny”, like the body of an infant. The stages of development and growth of this “infant” will be discussed later in greater detail.) 32 In other words, the commandments are the aspect of the actual vessels and vehicles for G -dly influence and light to radia te within Creation in a revealed and pervading manner, as opposed to only in an encompassing manner. (That is, when the Jewish People fulfill the Divine will through the actual fulfillment of the positive commandments (in action), this draws forth actual vitality and G -dliness within the three aspects of each of the vessels, which creates and vitalizes the created worlds. In contrast, were the Jewish People to cease fulfilling the Divine will, G -d forbid, all G -dliness would be withdrawn from the worlds a nd they would cease to be brought into existence. (Rather, all of the “vessels” of existence would withdraw back to their original source within the Reshimu .) However, this is actually impossible, since an “impression of life” and G -dliness remains wi thin the Jewish people even while they are in exile, so that there will always be at least some Jews who will remain loyal to G-d and adhere to His commandments, even if they fulfill them only by rote. Even though these commandments are fulfilled only by rote, this nevertheless draws forth actual vitality and G -dliness into the created worlds. This is because, ultimately, their general reason and intention in doing them is to just fulfill G- d’s will.) (It is noteworthy to point out that the word Mitzvah – Commandment itself shares the same grammatical root as the word Tzavta – To Bind. That is, when one performs a Mitzvah - commandment in action, he literally binds himself to the Essence of the Creator, Blessed Be He. It is also worthy to note that the a ctual performance of the commandments ( Mitzvot ) in thought, speech and action, are only the external garments of the “limbs of the King”. Nevertheless, the “limbs of the King” are vested within these garments. Thus, when one hugs the King, although he ma y only be hugging His external garments, he is still and all,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" The aspect of ChaBa”D is the light of the devotional inte nt in the [performance of the] commandment ( Mitzvah ). There is a specific inner vessel for this, [with a specific restriction and] limitation. The aspect of ChaGa”T is the love and awe and the sublimation, for which there is an intermediary vessel etc. The aspect of NeHi”Y is the aspect of the power to actualize, [i.e.] to only do the will of the King , for which there is an external vessel . 34 (Generally, these are called Intent – Kavanah , Blessing – Brachah , and Action – Ma’aseh or Unification – Yichud , Blessing – Brachah , and Holiness – Kedushah, which are called [by the acronym] YaBo”K . As is explained elsewhere at length, t hese are [also represented by ] the matter of the Flesh ( Basar ), Tendons ( Geedin ) and Bones ( Atzamot ) of every limb . 35 ) 36       hugging the King himself, literally, because, after all, the King is wearing them. The differences between Garments – Levooshim and Vessels – Kelim will be discussed later at great length.) 33 The Five Kindnesses ( Heh Chassadim ) is the aspect of the drawing forth of additional influence and light from the encompassing lights to the inner lights. This spawns “growth” in the Light, and therefore “growth” in the vessels, as will soon be explained. 34 Generally, just as there are three general vessels of the Brain, the Heart and the Liver (or Sublimation ( Bitul ), Feeling of Vitality and Life Force ( Moorgash ) and Spreading Forth of the Life Force or Power of Actualization ( Hitpashtoot )), so likewise, t here are three general vessels in the performance of the Mitzvot - commandments. There is the inner intention and sublimation to G -d to fulfill the will of the King alone, which is the innerness of vessel of the Brain of the commandments. This causes a gen eral sublimation of all of the worlds to G -d. (This is similar to the general sublimation of the limbs of the body to the soul.) Then there is the love and fear (and the sublimation and drawing forth of the heart in the right ventricle) which is the inte rmediary vessel of the Heart of the commandments. This causes an awareness and feeling of G -dliness and vitality to the worlds. (This is similar to the general feeling of vitality of the body.) Then there is the power to actualize and actually perform t he will of the King in action, which is the externality of the vessel of the “Liver” of the commandments. This causes an actual issuance of the Infinite Light within the created worlds. (This is similar to the actual spreading forth of particular vitalit y in the blood t o each of the particular limbs and organs of the body, such as the power of sight, the power of hearing or the power of movement etc.) Now, it is clearly understood that all three of these aspects are necessary for actual vitality to be brought forth. In other words, if one only has the inner intention of the commandments, which is the inner aspect of the vessels, then there is not yet any actual spreading forth of vitality. Likewise, even if one has the intention, plus the love and awe , nonetheless, there is still no actual spreading forth of vitality throughout the “body”. It is only when there is the external aspect of the vessel, which is the performance of the Mitzvah - commandment in actuality, that there is an actual issuance of li fe force, since all three matters are present. (Now, all of the above is only in general, and is only the aspect of the general Nefesh of the Mitzvot – Commandments. However, just as each of the aforementioned levels of man also divide into three particu lar levels of Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah , so too, the Mitzvot – Commandments also each possess these three aspects. Thus, when the performance of the Mitzvot - Commandments is done only with the aspect of the Nefesh , this brings about actual vitality to the world, but only in the same way as one who does something by rote (or worse, like the vitality of one who is asleep). However, when, through the toil of Hitbonenut - Contemplation, a person causes the higher levels of his soul to become revealed in an inne r manner (as opposed to being concealed in an encompassing manner), and when this is invested in the actual performance of the Mitzvot - commandments, so too, there is a greater revelation of the True Reality of G -d throughout all of the worlds, and there is a greater influx of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ) throughout all of the worlds in an inner manner.) 35 This is to say that the body of a human being, whether he is a fetus or whether he is a fully grown adult, possesses two hundred and forty eight limb s. Each limb includes three parts: flesh ( Basar ), tendons ( Geedin ) and bones ( Atzamot ). (There is also the matter of skin ( Or ) which will be explained later.) This is true whether he is in the fetal state ( Ibbur ), whether he is a child, or whether he is a completely grown adult. There is no difference in the number of limbs, because no additional limbs come about in the course of time of his growth from childhood to adulthood.. This is because the source of the limbs themselves is in"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" Now, the Five Kindnesses which bring about growth ( Heh Chassadim HaMagdeelim ) are the asp ect of the general drawing down and revelation of the G -dly Light through [the fulfillment of] each [particular] commandment. 37 Thi s is by way of the drawing down of the Kav – Line, which draws from the Source of all kindnesses , for “He 38 water ’s the tree” , similar to the statement, “You fill all the names” etc . 39 (Now, a ccording to this, the statement, “They would remain as a body [without a soul” becomes understood]. This is bec ause even the aspect of the “Body – Goofa ” , with the       the Reshimu . Rather , there is only additional growth in the limbs themselves, so that a small limb becomes a large limb. However, the growth is proportional. In other words, the length and width of the limb is proportional to the influx of the light of that limb. (This is similar to what was mentioned previously regarding how the length and width of the explanations are according to the grasp of the depth of the concept.) 36 See Shaar HaGilgulim , Chapter 11, where the Holy Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (the Arizal) makes a distincti on between the 365 veins ( Geedin ) and the “ Geedin – tendons” spoken of here, which are part of the 248 Limbs. 37 In Etz Chaim ( Shaar Pirke HaTzelem , Chapter 6) it states that the five kindnesses ( Heh Chassadim ) is the aspect of the influence of the last Heh of the name Sa”G of Binah, which is the aspect of Tvunah . This matter, and the fact that it is these five kindness which cause an additional revelation of light within the vessels, thus causing them to “grow”, may be understood according to what was stat ed earlier regarding the aspect of Tvunah . In chapter two we explained that there are two matters in Binah , there is Binah and there is Tvunah . It was explained there that Tvunah is the spreading forth of the light of Binah , which comes about specificall y through the grasp of the depth of the concept in one’s comprehension in a concrete manner. It was further explained that it is specifically one who grasps the depth of the concept who has the ability to bring it down in a revealed manner to the recipien t (i.e. the inner lights of the body, the revealed intellect, the heartfelt emotions, or the gut emotions which compel one to act etc). Thus, it is the faculty of Tvunah which draws forth the “depth” of the encompassing light ( Ohr Makif ) in an inner manne r ( Ohr Pnimi ), thus causing the growth of the emotions, and bringing about the gut emotions which lead to action (or an additional influence of the depth to the recipient) etc. This grasp of the depth comes about specifically through active Hitbonenut - contemplation, which brings about the inner sublimation and sight of the mind’s eye into the essential depth and G -dliness of the G -dly matter which one contemplates. This is to say that through Hitbonenut -contemplation and the automatic sublimation to G -d which results from it, (i.e. the Koach Ma”H ) one causes the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) to be drawn down and vested within the inner light and revelation of the Kav – Line (which reaches all the way down to this world, as explained before). As explained previously, it is this aspect of the Kav - Line which is the source of all “kindnesses” and revelations throughout the entire chaining down of the world. (It is for this reason that it states, “ Talmud Torah K’Neged Koolam – The stu dy of Torah is equal to all [of the other Mitzvot - commandments]”, since it causes the Essence of the Infinite Light to be drawn down into all the worlds and “limbs” (i.e. all the other commandments) in a revealed manner. This is specifically true of the i nner aspects of the Torah, such as Kabbalah and Chassidus, which are the aspects of the Chayah and Yechidah of the Torah.) 38 The word “He” refers to the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) which is vested within the Kav – Line, as explained at length in previous chapters, and as is evident from the text of the introduction to Tikkunei Zohar (page 17). 39 That is, just as the soul vitalizes and animates the body, so too, it is the radiance of the Essence of the Infinite Light within the Kav – Line which pervades and vitalizes all of Creation. (As explained previously, the names are the vessels for the light.) To the degree that the Essence of the Infinite Light is drawn forth in a pervading manner within the Kav , is the degree that the worlds become bound up with the very Essence of G -d in a revealed and pervading manner (as opposed to only an encompassing manner). When this radiance is diminished and withdrawn, the names, i.e. the vessels and all the worlds, remain “as a body without a soul” , or like a tree without water."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"aforementioned three vessels, requires the radiance of the Infinite Light within the Kav , which “fills all the names”. 40 This is because there is an independent source for the existence of the Vessels ( Kelim ), as previously explained. However, if this is the case, then why is this statement made dependant upon something which [at first glance] is not the essence of the matter, whic h is the statement “they will remain like a body without a soul”. However , since the essential matter of the vessels is that they correspond to the nine sefirot of the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah , and it is because of the incre ase of the light that there is growth i n the vessels, in order for the light of the influence to be bro ught down, [therefore,] “ If You would withdraw from them, they would remain as a body without a soul”. In other words, they c ould not spread forth , whatsoever. This will suffice for those of understanding. ) End of Chapter Thirty   40 This is to say that although the vessels have their source in the Reshimu , independent of the radiance of the Lights within them, nevertheless, without the radiance of the lights they would be like a “body without a soul”. However, the Rebbe asks, if the source of vessels preceded and is higher than the source of the lights, what difference does it make if the revelation of Light in an inner manner is lacking or not? In other words, why does the Zohar tell us that they wo uld remain as a body “without a soul” if the source of the “body” is higher than that of the “soul”? However, the explanation of the matter is that the ultimate purpose of the vessels is to draw down the Infinite Light, and to specifically reveal it, in an inner manner. This is similar to the fact that the essential light of the soul is drawn forth specifically when it is vested within the vessels and organs of the body. However, when the light of the soul is withdrawn from the vessel of the body, G -d forbid, then the body remains as an inanimate mass, and does not reveal the soul. Similarly above, if there would not be any radiance of the Infinite Light within the Kav in an inner manner, to pervade the vessels of the Reshimu , there would be no spreadi ng forth of G - dliness into the worlds and they would remain, as a “body without a soul”. (Actually, they would withdraw back into their source within the Reshimu , and lose all existence, and all that would rem ain of them would be the simple primal matter ( Chomer Pashut ). From this we see that all of created existence is dependant upon the radiance of the Infinite Light within Creation, which is drawn forth specifically through the two hundred and forty eight p ositive Mitzvot - commandments (and specifically through Hitbonenut - contemplation into the Torah which “is equal to them all”).

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty One Now, there is a great advantage of the aspect of the Vessels ( Kelim ), over an d above the aspect of the Lights ( Orot ). This is because there is a greater aspect of inte r-inclusion in the vessels than in the lights. This is the main aspect of Tikkun – Rectification. For, as is known, the main aspect of Tikkun – Rectification comes about because of the abundance of vessels. 1 More over, it is specifically by means of the external aspect of the vessel, which is the aspect of NeHi”Y . This is evidenced by the f act that we find that in some circumstances the light of Chessed – Kindness may radiate within a vessel of Gevurah – Judgment, or that a light of Gevurah – Judgment [ may radiate] within a vessel of Chessed – Kindness. 2 If this is so , that the light may   1 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaTikkun ) Shaar 10, Chapter 5 , and Shaar 12, Chapter 4 . This was already explained in chapter twenty, in the explanation of the difference between the e ssential lights of Tohu (Chaos), and the abundant vessels of Tikkun (Rectification). In Tohu (Chaos) the lights are essential lights, which are called Nekoodim (points). This is to say that they do not extend outside of their essential state, but are bou nd up in a single vessel, a point. Because of this, the essential lights of the sefirot cannot inter - include with one another, and the one must “die” before the next can “reign”. In contrast, in Tikkun (Rectification), because the lights are limited line s of revelation, and there are abundant vessels of expression which extend outside of their essential state, it is possible for them to inter -include. This is to say that there is a subdivision, so that each sefirah inter -includes all the other sefirot an d can therefore merge or be tempered by others. In this case, there are many possible manners of expression (i.e. an abundance of vessels) and not just a single point of expression. (It was previously explained that this is called a Partzuf – Stature or Personage, as opposed to a Nekudah – Point etc.) The example given before regarded the difference between the essential qualities of fire and water, as opposed to the composite qualities of fire and water. The essential quality of fire is infinitely hot, and can therefore not mix or coexist with the essential quality of water, which is infinitely cold. However, in their expression as they are outside of their essential state, in which there is a subdivision and inter -inclusion of fire and water, it is possible for there to be an infinite gamut of varying temperatures of heat and cold, since none of them are essential, but rather, each includes something of the other to a certain measure. In other words, if something is not infinite hot, no matter how hot it is, it is somewhat cold and if something is not infinitely cold, no matter how cold it is, it is somewhat hot. This is possible because of an abundance of vessels of expression, so that there is not one single essential mode of expression. This comes about specifically because of the subdivision and inter -inclusion of the sefirot , in that they are not in their essential states, in which they cannot tolerate one another ( Tohu – Chaos). 2 An example of these two cases was given previously. An example of a Light of Kindness ( Chessed ) within a vessel or vehicle of Judgment ( Gevurah ) is when a father, who loves his son, restrains and rebukes his child so that he should not come to physical harm. In this example, the light of the father’s love ( Chessed ) for his child is expressed through its opposite vessel, that of Judgment and discipline ( Gevurah ). An opposite example, in which the light of Judgment ( Gevurah ) is invested within a vessel or vehicle of kindness ( Chessed ), which is its opposite, is when one gives charity to his sworn enemy. Although the act itself (the vessel) is an act of kindness, it really is the worst type of punishment which one could perpetrate"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"be exchanged to radiate within its opposite vessel, if it i s because of [the l ight] itself, then why can it not become i nter -included and bound with a light which is its opposite and opposes it? 3 For example, the light of the attribute of Chessed – Kindness will not tolerate the light of the attribute of Judgment ( Din ), whatsoever. Rather, we must say, that this [inter -inclusion] is beca use of the aspect of the vessel ( Keli ), whi ch has the ability to tolerate an opposite light which opposes it. This is because it is specifically in the vessels that the aspect and matter of the i nter -inclusion of a t hing with its opposite [is possible]. This is not the case [in regard to] the Lights ( Orot ). Similarly, in man, the main aspect of rectification is from the angle of his body. A s we clearly observe with our senses in regard to the n ature of man’s organs , that each organ contains an inter -inclusion of its fellow [organs ], 4 to the point that it is possible to rectify a lacking [in one organ] through healing a different organ . For example, for a problem in the eye sight, healing may be applied to the power of the nerves in the foot , since they include within the mselves [something of] the nerves of the eye. 5 Howe ver, in the case of old age and the like, [in which] the light and vitalit y of the brain becomes weakened to the point that [o ne ’ s] sight becomes weakened, one cannot heal [this] through strengthening the power and light of the vitality of the emotions of the heart, even though the heart and brain are inter -included with one another. It is only through strengthening the vessel of the heart that the vessel of the brain may become strengthened, so that the power of the int ellect will radiate to a greater degree , and he will [thereby] have better vision . 6 This is because there is not as much of a connection and inter -inclusion betw een the light of the intellect and the light of the em otions, as there is       against his enemy. This is to say that the shame and embarrassment in receiving beneficence from one’s sworn enemy is a thousand times more shameful and embarrassing than receiving charity from anyone else, which is an embarrassment to begin with etc. Similarly, the Torah states that G -d rewards His enemies upfront, in this world, for their few good deeds, in order to destroy them later, in the world to come. (Deuteronomy 7:10) 3 As explained before, in the essential lights of Tohu (Chaos) the essential light of one sefirah cannot tolerate or join with its opposite, and must “die” before the nex t one can “reign”. Rather, inter -inclusion comes about specifically through of the aspect of limited vessels of expression, outside of the essence. 4 See Siddur , Shaar Nefilat Apayim 91c. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmta’ee , Kuntreisim, page 407. 5 It is this inter -inclusion of the limbs of the physical body which is the foundational principle of the eastern healing method of acupuncture. 6 In other words, the evidence that the inter - inclusion takes place specifically in the vessels and “organs”, is from t he fact that one cannot heal or strengthen his power of sight through contemplation or emotional exercises. Rather, he must correct the physical eye either through laser surgery or by creating an additional vessel (such as eyeglasses) which will re -adjust his vision, or bring about an improvement through the physical manipulation of organs other than the eye, such as acupuncture. It is only through the external healing of the vessels themselves that they may become proper receptacles for the light of the powers of the soul. That is, it is specifically through the application of healing to the external vessels and organs, such as the eye, that the spiritual light and power of the sight of the soul may be drawn down to, once again, radiate within the vessel . (This is because it is the vessel that needs the “fixing” and not the light of the soul, within which there is no blemish. The indication that there is no blemish in the light of the powers of the soul, but rather, only in the external vessel, is from the fact that a blind person may give birth to a perfectly sighted child, as previously explained.) We therefore see that the inter -inclusion is specifically a function of the vessels and “organs” rather than the essential lights."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"between the vessel of the heart and the vessel of the brain. This is likewise the case in regard to the vessel of the eye, the vessel of the nose and the vessel of the ear, and the like. It is for this reason that it is specifically from the angle of the aspect of the Vessel ( Keli ) that it is possible for its opposite light to radiate within it. 7 This will suffice for those of understanding. This may be further understood from our observation that the emotions of Chessed – Kindness and Gevurah – Judgment are opposites which literally oppose each other. 8 Nonetheless , when these emotions come into a vessel, 9 such as actual thought, speech and action, it is possible for the light of Chessed – Kin dness to radiate in a thought, speech and action , which is its opposite . 10 [This is so] since it is possible to think, speak and do the opposite of that which is in his heart. Similarly, a person can become angry in his heart against someone whom he loves in his heart, or h e may have mercy in his heart towards someone whom he despises etc. This is because the heart is prepared to be come a receptacle for that which is its op posite, since there is a [greater] inter -inclusion of one thing and it s opposite in the vessels, rather than the lights. (The fact that in jubilation there is trembling and in wrath there is mercy, or the opposite , that in trembling there is jubilation and in mercy there is wrath, is all specifically due to the vessels . 11 )   7 That is to say, becaus e each vessel contains some element of all the other qualities within it, it is possible for it to be a vessel for its opposite. This is not the case in regard to the essential lights, being that they are essential qualities which do not possess anything of their opposite. (Refer back to the example of the essential qualities of fire and water, as opposed to the limited expressions of these qualities, wherein each quality must posses something of its opposite.) 8 In other words, the essential light of the emotional quality of Chessed (Kindness) is the literal opposite of the essential light of the emotional quality of Gevurah (Might/Judgment). 9 That is to say, when these lights are expressed in a limited fashion outside of their essential state, it is the n possible for the two opposites to inter -include. 10 Although, actually, this example of thought, speech and action is an example of Levooshin (Garments), nevertheless, it applies to the vessels as well. This is because just as one is capable of expressin g the opposite of that which is in his heart or mind etc., so too, one is capable of becoming emotionally aroused in a manner which is the opposite of the true essential feeling of his heart or mind etc. For example, one is capable of becoming angered in his heart towards one whom he loves with his heart etc. This is only possible because the heart is capable of being a vessel for both of these qualities, because it inter -includes both. The reason it includes both is because it is a limited vessel, and t herefore is only capable of containing limited quantities and qualities. A limited quality and quantity of Chessed may indeed become inter -included and tempered through a limited quality and quantity of Gevurah . However, this is not so in regard to the e ssential lights which are of an infinite and essential quality. Thus, the vessels, (just as the garments) are vehicles for limited expression, outside of the essence. It is because of this limitation, restriction and subdivision that unification and inte r-inclusion is possible in the vessels. 11 This is to say that when one experiences joy in the vessel of his heart, he does not experience the true essence of the quality of joy. Rather, within this joy there is a degree of anger and the like, which temper s the joy. It is because of this that there are different degrees of joy (similar to the example of heat and cold given above). The same is true of the opposite, which is the quality of anger. In anger there is something of the quality of joy, and for t his reason there are different degrees of anger. This is because these are not expressions of pure essential of joy, nor of pure essential anger, but are rather only composite qualities. If the essences of these qualities were to be revealed, a physical world of composites could not exist, and one quality would have to “die” before the next one could “reign”, as explained previously with the explanation of the kings of Tohu who died. (It is for this reason that the statement that, “G -d created worlds and destroyed them”, does not apply to this physical world of composites at all, but rather, to the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" We similarly find this [matter] in t he six days of creation. T he first day is the aspect of the Chessed – Kindness of “Let there be light”, 12 while the second day is the aspect of the Gevurah – Judgment of “Let there be a firmament”, 13 as it states in the Zohar, 14 “Each day has its function ”. 15 Nevertheless, in each day there is specifically an inter -inclusio n of the other days , as is known. This is because it is specifically when the light comes i nto the vessel which is called “day”, 16 that an inter -inclusion of one thing with its opposite [occurs]. This is because, when the matter comes to be influenced in actuality, it is impossible that kindness will not have the aspect of judgment inter -included in it, or that judgment [will not have] the aspect of kindne ss [inter -included in it] . 17 This is not the case, however, when the light and influence [remains] without a vessel , as of yet . 18 An example of this is a Halachic legal ruling which is specifically for [the purpose of] practical application . Of necessity there will be an inter -inclusion of kindness within the judgment or of judgment within the kindness. 19 However, t his is not the case when the ruling is not       worlds of Tohu – Chaos, wherein the essential qualities were revealed as infinite indiluted points. See Torah Ohr 51d of the Alter Rebbe, Rabbi Shne ur Zalman of Liadi, and Likkutei Torah , Parshat Kedoshim of the Holy Rabbi Yitzchak Luria.) 12 Genesis 1:3 13 Genesis 1:6 14 See Zohar Vayigash 205a, and Emor 94b. 15 That is to say, each one of the seven days of the week corresponds to one of the seven lower sefirot of Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malchut . In each day of the week, one of these seven sefirot is the dominant quality of that particular day. Nevertheless, this world is a world of Tikkun – rectification and composites, where essential qualities are not revealed, but are rather only expressed in a composite form. All kindness in this physical world includes a measure of its opposite which is judgment, and vise versa, etc. Therefore, as the Rebbe will state momentarily, each d ay of the week inter -includes the qualities of all the other days of the week as well, so that, although a particular quality is dominant, all the other qualities are present as well, with all of their subdivisions and inter -inclusions. If this were not s o, this physical world of composites could not exist. 16 This is to say that a “day – Yom ” constitutes the bringing forth of the influence into actuality, and is thus the vessel for the influence of that day. The reason for this is because a day is a limit ed measure of time. It therefore is capable of the inter -inclusion many qualities. This is because, as the Rebbe will soon state, when the influence comes to be influenced in actuality, in a limited manner, within the vessels which restrain the light, it is impossible for one quality not also possess something of all the other qualities. In contrast, as the essential light exists before being influenced as an actual “day”, it cannot inter -include with the other qualities actually opposes them. Rather, wh en the light is in its essential state cannot be called by the term “day”, for, as explained before, it is still in the aspect of a “point – Nekudah ”, which transcends time. This is because a point has no measure. It has no beginning, middle or end, and i s therefore above the quality and definition of time. Thus, it is specifically when there is a limitation and measure of the vessel of expression, which is called a “day”, that there can be an inter -inclusion of all the qualities ( Tikkun - Rectification), as opposed to the essential points of Tohu – Chaos, which transcend time and cannot be defined by the term “day”. 17 When there is a limited expression of any quality, it is a certainty that there is an inter -inclusion of its opposite within that quality, a s explained above. If this were not the case, then it would not be a limited expression of that quality, but rather, it would be an infinite revelation of the essence of that quality. However, when there is a limited expression of any quality, it is a ce rtainty that it must by tempered and limited through inter -inclusion of its opposite quality. 18 See previous footnotes and chapter twenty, in which the difference between the essential Lights of Tohu (Chaos), and the limited vessels of Tikkun (rectificatio n) were explained at length. 19 For example, when a person’s heart is boiling with anger towards someone else, such as the anger of King Achashverosh towards the wicked Haman, to the point that he wanted him immediately killed, it is"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"[necessarily] for practical application . [From all the above] we find is that the primary aspect of inter -inclusion is in the aspect of the externali ty of the vessels, which relate to action. This will suffice for those of understanding. 20 However, at first glance there seems to be a contradiction to all this. This is because, in reality , the fact that the light is capable of radiating within its opposite vessel is because of the sublimation of the vessel to the light. This comes about by means of the aspect of the inner name of Ma”H , which is the source of the aspect of the inter -inclusions in the ligh ts, specifically, from the radiance of the Kav – Line. 21 It is specifically for this reason that the inter -inclusion is in the internality of the vessels , 22 rather than in the externality. 23       impossible that there w as no inter -inclusion of a measure of the quality of love within his anger. This is evidenced by the fact that he was incapable of kill him immediately. Rather, it took some time (i.e. “day”) for him to be killed. Were this the revelation of the essentia l quality of anger, not only would Haman have died on the spot, instantaneously, but, in actuality, the entire world would have immediatlely been destroyed, as mentioned before, that it is impossible for the essential qualities to be revealed within the wo rld of Tikkun – rectification. Rather, when the light comes out, to be influenced in actuality, as a limited action, only then it is possible for there to be an inter -inclusion of one quality with the others. (This is evidenced by the fact that the anger will dissipate and subside over time , as in the case of Achashverosh’s anger towards Queen Vashti.) 20 From all of the above we understand that inter -inclusion takes place specifically in the external aspect ( NeHi ”Y ) of the vessels, which is the limited ex pression as it relates to action. (That is to say, it is in the limited action where there is the greatest limitation of expression, and therefore, the greatest inter -inclusion of opposites.) The Rebbe will now pose a challenge to this, and explain that the inter -inclusion is specifically in the internal aspect of the vessels ( ChaBa”D ), which constitutes the sublimation ( Bitul ) of the vessels to the inner, pervading light, as previously explained. (Although this will appear to contradict all the above, t his will be resolved in the third section of this chapter.) 21 As explained in chapter fifteen, the inner name of 45 – Ma”H ( מ \" ה ) represents the aspect of the Koach Mah – “The power of what” ( כח מ \" ה ) – which is the aspect of sublimation ( Bitul ) to the Essence of G -d, as in Moshe’s statement, “ V’Nachnu Mah – What are we etc”. It is this sublimation to the Essence which allows fo r inter -inclusion and unity. This is because in the essence of G -d, the sefirot are an absolute unity and singularity. Therefore, it is because of the radiance of the Essential Light of G -d ( Atzmoot Our Ein Sof ) within the Kav - Line, that there can be int er-inclusion and unification of opposite sefirot throughout Creation. This is to say that the inter -inclusion in the vessels is because of their sublimation to the inner light which pervades them. This is similar to the fact that when one makes a movemen t, the external movement can only be according to his inner desire, the light of the essence of the soul which pervades this movement, to which it is sublimated. (Another aspect of the line is that it is a limited expression outside of the essentiality of a point, as previously explained at length.) 22 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (An example of this is the devotional intent in the performance of the Mitzvot - commandments, which includes two opposites. This is similar to the [matter of the] Atzamot V,Geedin – Bones and Tendons etc. This is not the case, [however], in the actual action.) [This statement may be understood as follows: The devotional intent of Moshe Rabbeinu when he fulfilled the Mitzvah - commandment of Tefillin (phylacteries) was with complete pu reness and holiness. However, the devotional intent of anyone else who is not at such a lofty level of holiness, may be a composite of good and evil, and not entirely pure etc. Nevertheless, in the actual external action of the mitzvah itself, the donnin g of Tefillin by Moshe, and the donning of Tefillin of even the simplest Jew, is literally equal. As explained in the previous chapter, the “bones – Atzamot ”, “tendons – Geedin ”, and “flesh – Basar ” correspond to the devotional intent ( Kavanah ), the bless ing ( Brachah ), and the action ( Ma’aseh ).] 23 This is to say that the inter -inclusions actually occur in the inner aspect of the vessels ( ChaBa”D ), which is the sublimation ( Bitul ) of the vessels to the radiance of the limited pervading light of the limited desire and intellect etc, from which they receive. According to the composite of the limited ray of the inner pervading light of the desire etc, will be the composite in the inner aspect of the vessels. It is only because of this sublimation to the inner intention and desire that the composite in the action is possible. Thus, the external action is merely according to this inner composite and determination. Therefore, the composite"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" This is because , [as is known, 24 ] one angel cann ot perform two oppo site missions . 25 This is because all sending forth of influence comes about specifically from the externality of the vessels, which brings out the influence .

Because of this [ the Zohar states,] “Each day specifically has its own function” . 28 Howe ver , the [explanation of the] mat ter is that because the inner aspect of the vessels receive s from the aspect of the inner [pervading] lights which become limited within the vessel, [therefore,] when there is an inter -inclusion in the lights , there is an a utomatic inter - inclusion in the internality of the vessels. 29 This is similar to the arousal and comprehension of [the angels] Michael and Gabriel etc. 30       actually takes place in the inner aspect of the vessels, which receives the radiance of the inner pervading light. In contrast, in the external aspect of the vessels, which is the spreading forth of the action itself, there is no true composite. For example, when the aforementioned father disciplines his child, although ther e is a composite in his inner intention and desire, nevertheless, in the external action, the discipline is a discipline etc. External action cannot be two things at once. It can only be one thing. We clearly see from this that the composite takes place specifically in the inner aspect of the vessels rather than in the external aspect of the vessels. This will now be explained further. 24 See Bereshit Rabba, Parsha 50:2. It explains there that the reason that three angels were sent to Avraham (and to des troy Sodom etc) was because each angel had a specific mission, and one angel cannot perform multiple missions etc. 25 As will later be explained, the source of the angels is from the externality of the vessels ( NeHi”Y ) of the worlds. Thus, the entire funct ion of the angels is that they are agents who bring forth the actual influence, in actuality. (This will be explained later at greater length.) However, it is known that one angel cannot perform two opposite tasks. Thus, the face of the lion (in Ezekiel ’s prophecy) is always to the right, and the face of the ox is always to the left, the face of man is always to the front, and the face of the eagle is always to the back. They cannot change their function or task. (This is similar to how the brain is al ways the vessel and vehicle for intellectual thought, the heart is always the vessel and vehicle for the heartfelt emotions and the liver is always the vessel and vehicle for the life force and “gut” emotions etc. It is the eye which is always the vessel for the power of sight, and the ear which is always the vessel for the power of hearing, the nose is always the vessel and vehicle for the power of smell and the mouth is always the vessel for the power of speech etc. These external vessels cannot change their functions.) 26 Each of the letters of the Aleph -Bet is a vehicle for a particular influence, and not any other influence. If one letter is exchanged for another letter, confusion will result. For example, each of the letters and words of this paragr aph are arranged to convey a certain particular idea. If these letters would be re -arranged and scrambled, they would not convey the true and proper intention. 27 Ezekiel 1:10 28 That is to say, each day of the week has its own particular influence, separat e from all other days. 29 This can be understood as follows: In the first part of the chapter, when the Rebbe spoke of the difference between the Lights ( Orot ) and Vessels ( Kelim ), he was referring to the general difference between the essential limitless lights (of Tohu ) and the limited vessels of expression (of Tikkun ). That is, the essential lights do not vest within the vessels, but transcend and encompass the vessels. Moreover, there is no inter -inclusion in these essential lights, and the essential light of the quality of Chessed does not inter -include with that of Gevurah etc. However, all of this refers to the encompassing essential lights. In the second part of the chapter the Rebbe spoke of the limited rays of the inner pervading lights which d o indeed vest within the innerness of the vessels. Because these inner pervading lights are no longer unlimited and essential, but are only limited rays of revelation of the qualities, powers and essential desire of the soul, there can therefore be inter -inclusion in these lights (as previously explained). (Nevertheless, as explained previously (in the explanation of the Lights), even the limited inner pervading light of the soul"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" [H ow ever ,] the externality of the vessels [receive] from the aspect of , “T he Potential Power to L imit - Koach HaGvool ”, which is in an aspect of an encompassing [light]. 31 There can therefore be two opposites as one within them, which is the aspect of the inter -inclusion one thing with it ’ s opposite , specifically . This is similar to all miracles, 32 whic h spe cifically take       which vests within the vessels is not at all separate from the essential enc ompassing light of a person’s desire, but is only a limited expression thereof, and is totally bound with his essence.) Therefore, when there is an inter -inclusion in the limited pervading lights of the soul, there will be an inter -inclusion in the inner aspect of the vessels ( ChaBa”D ) which is the inner sublimation of the vessels to the lights of the soul. In other words, (for example,) when he has a limited desire for a particular thing in a particular way, there is certainly an inter -inclusion in this limited desire, for otherwise it could not be expressed in a limited fashion. Because there is an inter -inclusion in this desire, there will be an inter -inclusion in the actualization of this desire. It is understood that the inter -inclusion in the actu alization will only be exactly according to the inter -inclusion in the light of the limited desire, because the vessels are sublimated to the light etc. 30 This is to say that although in their functions and actions, the angels Michael ( Chessed ) and Gabriel ( Gevurah ) differ from each other, nonetheless, this is only externally. Internally, however, they do not contradict each other at all, because of their sublimation to their common essence, which is the ray of the G-dliness which they perceive and grasp. This is similar to the inner aspect of the vessels which are all equally sublimated to the essential light of the soul. It is because of this that they all function as a single composite organism, and one quality does not negate its opposite. Moreover, they all work in conjunction and in harmony, as one unified system to carry out the will of the soul. Regarding this matter of the inner aspect of the cooperation and composite unity of the vessels or Angels it states, “ He makes peace in His heights” - Osse h Shalom BiMromav. . This is to say that because the angels and vessels are sublimated to the essential light of G - d from which they receive, there is therefore “peace” between them, and there capable of compromise and co -existence, so that they work toget her as one unified system. (The reason this is possible is because in the essence of G -d these different qualities are not in conflict at all . This is because, as explained in previous chapters, G -d is essentially absolutely singular. In the Essence of the Infinite Light the sefirot are totally and absolutely one with the singular essence, and are therefore inseparable and indistinguishable from it, as explained in chapters 10 and 11. Furthermore, they are so totally one in essence, that they cannot eve n be said to be “unified” or “included” with each other or even with G - d’s Essence. This is because they are totally one with the singular Essence of G -d. Because the secondary light and ray of the inner pervading light of the Kav contains a radiance of this Essential light, and is totally bound to G - d’s Essence, it therefore possesses the ability to unify and inter -include the sefirot , thus creating composite modes of conducts ( Partzufim ). This is the meaning of “You are He who unifies them, and binds t hem...” Therefore, because the angels and vessels are sublimated to this essential radiance of G - d’s Essence within the Kav , they do not conflict and there is “peace” between them so that they can bring forth and influence a a way of a composite. This was explained in previous chapters with the explanation of the inner name of Ma”H .) 31 That is to say, the actual limitation itself ( Gvool B’Poel ) comes directly from the potential power to limit ( Koach HaGvool ) of the encompassing light. In other words, the f act that the eye is a vessel for the light of the power of sight, and the fact that the brain is a vessel for the light of the intellect and the heart for the emotions etc, comes directly from the dictates of the potential power to limit (of the Reshimu ), i.e. the source of the vessels which limit. (However, what he will think, and what he will feel or see or move etc, comes from the radiance of the inner pervading light of his desire.) Hence, the fact that there is an inter - inclusion in the externality o f the vessels, in the actualization, is because that is how He (G -d) desires in His Essence to limit Himself. (In other words, the fact that the eye is a vessel for sight and the brain for intellect etc is only because G -d, in His Essence, determined that the eye should be a vessel which limits the light of sight and the brain should be a vessel for the intellectual powers etc.) 32 In the first part of the chapter, the Rebbe gave an analogy for the inter -inclusion from the natural inter - inclusion in the ves sels and organs of a human being. Here, however, he gives analogies of supernatural occurrences such as miracles etc. The reason for this difference is because there is a radical difference between a human being and the Creator. That is, the human being does not create his organs and vessels, and it therefore seems only natural to him that his brain should be a vessel for thought and that the eyes are"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"place in the aspect of the externality of the vessels, which is the [performance of the miracle ] in actuality. For example, every place in wh ich a miracle is performed, is a place withstands a thing and its opposite [simultaneously ]. [This is to say that, at once , it includes ] that which is above nature within nature [itself]. An ex ample of this is the transformation of the sea to dry land, and similarly, [the fact that] the place of the H oly Ark was not according to [natural] measurable dimensions, 33 as is explained elsewhere. 34 Likewise, it is [specifically] from there that the source of divisions comes, to separate each [thing] unto i tself. This comes about due to of the aspect of the Kav HaMidah – The Line of Measurement in the Encompas sing [Light], since it is the source of the vessels which limit. 35 For this reason the primary aspect of rectification is specifically the aspect of the abunda nce of subdivisions . 36 I t is specifically because of the [subdivisions] that there can be an abun dance of i nter -inclusions of one thing with its opposite as one. 37       a vessel for sight etc. However, in the analogue, of how it is above, in relation to G -d, it is not thi s way. Rather, there is a radical difference between us and G -d, in that G -d actually creates his vessels and “organs” (as in the previous explanation of the statement that “He and His Organs are one”). Therefore, in truth, from G - d’s perspective to brin g about a miraculous event, such as turning the sea to dry land etc, is no different as to bring it about that dry land should act as dry land does. Both matters are equal for him. This is because it is G -d who tells the dry land to have the properties th at dry land has, and if he desires to that water should assume the same properties as dry land, then water acts as dry land acts, as occurred during the splitting of the Red sea. 33 If one were to measure the Holy Ark in and of itself, it possessed a limit ed measurment . If he then measured the Holy of Holies, which was the room within which the Holy Ark was placed, it too had a limited measurment of 20 cubits by 20 cubits etc . However, when the Holy Ark was measured in relation to the Holy of Holies, it d id not take up any space at all. This is to say that the distance of the wall of the Holy of Holies to one side of the Holy Ark was 10 cubits, and the distance of the opposite wall to the other side of the Holy Ark was also 10 cubits. This phenomenon took place when the distances between any walls of the Holy of Holies were measured in relation to the Holy Ark. In other words, although when measured against itself, the Holy Ark had limited, dimensions and measure, nevertheless, when measured against the Ho ly of Holies it was as if it did not exist, and took up no space. It was there and not there, simultaneously. (Similarly, the entire world is created in such a manner. This is to say that when the universe or anything in it, is measured against itself, i t has a certain limited measure etc. However, when it is measured against True R eality , which is G - d’s absolute and infinite being, it is as if the world takes up no space at all, as if it does not have any existence at all.) 34 See Tractate Yoma 21a. 35 As explained previously, it is the power of the Kav HaMidah – The Measuring Line, which defines the borders, limitations and measurements of all that is brought into being. This is to say that it is G -d Himself who defines and limits each entity, and determ ines what it will limit and be a vessel and vehicle for etc. It is, specifically, these definitions and measurements which limit each thing, thus separating and distinguishing it from everything else. 36 In other words, in the essential lights of Tohu (Cha os) which do not subdivide to include opposites, but are rather essential infinite qualities, there cannot be any inter -inclusion. It is specifically because of the subdivisions and limited expressions of the sefirot , that any inter -inclusion of one sefir ah with its opposite can take place, as explained above at length. This is because, when there is a limitation of expression, each sefirah latently possesses something of its opposites. Therefore there is an infinite gamut of possible limited expressions, according to the composition etc. It is this inter -inclusion of opposites which is the primary aspect of the worlds of Tikkun - Rectification, in which there are limited expressions (rather than essential expressions), and inter -inclusions of opposites. It is clear that the more subdivisions there are, the more possible inter -inclusions there can be. 37 From all of the above it is understood that there are two aspects or types of inter -inclusions, which correspond to the two functions of the vessels , as mentioned above in chapter twenty seven. The first is that there is a change of existence, f rom spiritual to physical. This is to say that physical sight grasps"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" This is likewise the primary aspect of the “ Man of Rectification ” ( Adam D’Tikkun ), about whom it states, 38 “ Achor V’Kedem Tzartanee – You have formed m e b ack and front”, [which refers ] speci fically to formation ( Yetzirah ) 39 in a body of substance ( Goof Chomer ). Kedem – Front, refers to the aspect of the simple substance ( Chomer Pashoot ) that preceded the form ( Tzoorah ), which is the light. This is in the source of the vessels which preceded the light. Achor – Back, refers to the aspect of the vessel of substance which follows [the investment of] the Light and Form etc. This will suffice for those of understanding. 40 (This is in       physicality, which is not the case with the spiritual light of the power of sight. This is s imilarly the case with the light of the spiritual power of sight that merges in the physicality of the vessel of the brain, to the point that it is called “intellect”. Likewise, there is a change of existence from the spiritual power of movement as it ves ts within a physical movement. This is from the aspect of the inner aspect of the vessel which is sublimated to the limited ray of the inner pervading light of the soul. For example, this is the matter of what he thinks, and what he will look at and see etc, where there is a merging of the spiritual power of sight of the soul, with the vessel of the brain and of the eye etc , to produce “sight” and “intellect” . The second aspect is the matter of the limitation and measurement of the substance of the vesse l itself . That is to say, i t is limited and quantified to a certain measure. An example of this is how physical sight can only see so far . Or, more particularly, it is the fact that the eye is a vessel for the spiritual power of sight , at all , or the fa ct that the brain is a receptacle for the spiritual powers of the intellect, at all. This comes from the Kav HaMidah of the encompassing light, which defines the limits and measurments of all lights and vessels in actuality, specifically in the externalit y of the vessels. In this manner, the previous contradiction is resolved, in that there are two aspects of the vessels, internal and external, and two types of inter -inclusions which result thereby etc. The internal aspect of the vessel receives the radi ance of the limited ray of the inner pervading light of the desire of the soul to which it is sublimated. The external aspect of the vessel, which limits the light of the soul in actuality, receives from the potential power to limit of the encompassing li ght. (Therefore, when one has an ailment of sight, it is not because of what he looks at, but rather, there is a blemish in the vessel of his eye. In other words, it is not a fit receptacle for the power of sight. Thus, through specifically fixing the vessel of the eye, the light of the power of sight automatically is drawn into it etc.) 38 Psalms 139:5 39 As explained previously, the aspect of the Form – Tzoorah refers to the investment of the inner pervading light within the vessels etc. 40 In chapter twen ty nine, it was explained at length that the vessels have a source in the Essence of the Emanator independent of the Lights. They receive their limitations according to the Essential Heyulie ability and desire to Limit, as it is in the Essence of the Infi nite One ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). This is because, as explained above, a Being who is truly infinite also possesses the ability to limit. Nevertheless, His ability to limit is also infinite and in no way limits Him . Rather, G - d’s power to limit is the dir ect source of all limitations throughout the entire chaining down of the worlds. (In other words, there are two separate types of chaining down. There is the chaining down of the lights and the chaining down of the vessels. Now, the substance of the ves sels is literally the same Heyulie Substance mentioned above and derives its existence directly from there. In contrast, the form ( Tzurah ) and vitality of the vessels is from the aspect of the chaining down of the lights. However, both these aspects are literally rooted in the very Essence of the Infinite Light, and as they relate to Him, Blessed be He, they are literally one and the same power , as explained above. This explains why the Zohars states, “He and His organs are one” and “He and His life forc e are one”, as two separate statements, rather than expressing them as one statement, such as, “He and His organs and life force are one”. This is to teach us that, contrary to what we would have thought from the statement that the vessels come about from the “thickening” of the light, we must understand that this only refers to the form of the vessels. However, the substance of the vessels exists independently of the light and receives its existence directly from the Essence of the Emanator just as the lig ht receives its existence directly from the Emanator. Nevertheless, the ultimate intention is the unity of these two, the lights and the vessels. As explained at the end of the previous chapter, although the vessels have their source in the Reshimu , inde pendent of the radiance of the Lights within them, nevertheless, without the radiance of the lights they would be like a “body without a soul”. This is to say that the ultimate purpose"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"accordance with the explanatio n of this matter elsewhere at len gth, and should suffice for those of understanding. ) End of Chapter Thirty One       of the vessels is to draw down the Infinite Light, and to specifically reveal it, in an inner manner. This is similar to the fact that the essential light of the soul is drawn forth specifically when it is vested within the vessels and organs of the body. However, when the light of the soul is withdrawn from the vessel of the body, G -d forbid, then the body remains as an inanimate mass, and does not reveal the soul. It is specifically when there are both the vessels and the lights within them that there is a soul. (It is possible that this is the reason why the verse plac es “ Achor – Back” before “ Kedem – Front”, in order to indicate that although the source of the vessels preceded that of the light, nevertheless, the ultimate purpose of the vessels is to be receptacles of the light which will be invested in them. In furth er explanation, this verse brings up the concept of “The end action arose first in thought – Sof Maaseh B’Machshavah Tchilah ”. This is to say that the end action which arose in thought first is the primal source of the vessels, yet it is not the end actio n itself, but only the thought. This is the matter of “ Kedem - Front”. However, the end action itself is the actualization and fusion of the lights within the vessels, and is the matter of “ Achor – Back”. The verse places “ Achor – Back” first to indicat e that it is this investment of the lights within the vessels in a way of actualization of this primal thought, which is the ultimate goal of the world that arose first in thought.)"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty Two We now must understand the aspect of “the Upper Man” of [the world of] Atzilu t, who is “up on the throne etc ” . 1 This is the aspect of Zeir Anpin 2 of Atzilut which receives from the aspect of NeHi”Y of Chochmah and Binah . 3 As known , this is the matter and aspect of the Emotions ( Midot ) of [the world of] Atzilut , which is the primary [sourc e] and root of the influence for the “source of the source ” of the vitality of the worlds. 4 [Nonetheless,] it [itself] is still the end of the world of the Infinite, since “He and His life force and organs are one”, 5 as previously explained. 6 Ther efore, even up to the aspect of the vessels of Zeir Anpin , in the aspect of the externality of the NeHi”Y of [ Zeir Anpin ], is still considered to be of the end of the world of the Infinite. 7   1 Ezekiel 1:26 2 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar RaPa”Ch Nitzotzin ) Shaar 18, Chapter 5 in which it is explained that the aspect of Zeir Anpin which is the six emotional sefirot (of Atzilut ) corresponds to the letter Vav ( ו ) of G - d’s name. It further explains that the aspect of the emotional sefirot of Atzilut is represented by the expansion of the name of G -d known as the name of 45 ( מ \" ה ). This is to say that when the name four letter name Yod -Heh - Vav -Heh is expanded wit h the letter Aleph - א (as such: יו \" ד - ה \" א - וא \" ו - ה \" א ) it has a numerical value of 45 which is the same numerical value as the word “Man – Adam ( אדם ). For this reason, Zeir Anpin is called “the Upper Man who is on the Throne”. (The “Throne” is a reference to the world of Briyah – Creation, which is called, “The World of the Throne – Olam HaKiseh ” (See Etz Chaim, Shaar 42; Chapter 1). The world of Briyah – Creation will be discussed later.) 3 It was before explained at length that the aspects of Netzach, Hod and Yesod are the aspect of the spreading forth of the influence. In chapter twenty -six it was explained that the birth of the emotions comes from the spreading forth ( NeHi”Y ) of the essence of Chochmah and Binah etc. That is to say, the heartfelt emotion s (which are the aspect of Zeir Anpin ) become aroused according to the influence which they receive from the spreading forth of the intellectual faculties of Chochmah and Binah . (See Etz Chaim ( Shaar Drooshey HaNekudot ) Shaar 8, Chapter 2.) 4 As will be e xplained later, the actual source of influence for the Created worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah comes from Malchut (Kingdom) of the world of Atzilut , which is compared to the faculty of speech. However, the source of the speech, i.e. of the desire to speak, and of the voice and emotions which are revealed in the speech etc, comes from the aspect of the heartfelt emotions (as will be explained in later chapters). Therefore, these emotional sefirot ( Zeir Anpin ) of the world of Atzilut are the source of the source of influence for the created realms of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah . 5 See introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b. 6 As explained in the preceding chapters regarding the statement of the Zohar , “He and His life force and His organs are one”, even the most external vessels of the world of Atzilut are still completely and totally one with the Essence of the Infinite Light. This will become clearer in this chapter’s explanations and the analogies of how it is in man below. 7 The Rebbe will now explain h ow even the most external aspects of the heartfelt emotions of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut are still totally and completely bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) as it is before the first Tzimtzum - lessening of the light."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Now, the explanation of these matters [may be understood in a ma nner] of “From my flesh I shall behold G - d” , 8 because “Man was made in the image of G - d” , 9 as stated, 10 “ [Let us make man] i n our form and in our likeness” . 11 Now, we obse rve in the soul of man, that its aspects of Chayah and Yechidah are the aspects of the encompassing [lights, relative] to the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah , and transcend the limitation of lights within vessels. 12 This is the aspect of the simple essential desire and pleasure which is in the aspect of the Yechidah , plus the aspect of the inner ness and source of the intellect which is called Maskil , and is the aspect of the encompassing [light] of the Chayah . They do not become limited within the vessels at all. It is only from Chochmah down [that the light] is drawn into a vessel. This is the aspect of the Neshamah which is within the brain, the Ruach within the heart etc. 13 However, the light of the encompassing desire and pleasure nevertheless radiates from its concealment , from the inner aspect of the light of Chochmah , within the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah which are within the three vessels of the Brain, the Heart [and the Liver]. This is the revelation of the desire which comes into the revealed intellect and reasoning in the aspect of the brain of Chochmah , which is called the Light of Abba [i.e. Chochmah ]. From there it is drawn down and spreads forth in Binah , which is comprehension. 14 From the   8 Job 19: 26 9 Genesis 9:6 10 Genesis 1:26 11 Man was created as a microcosm of the entire Creation and is therefore called “a little world”. This means that everything that is found in man has its counterpart in Creation and in the Torah (as is known regarding the C hassidic explanation of the verse “This is the Torah of Man”), and vice -versa. Therefore, through understanding one’s own self in a manner of particulars (this being the allegory), one may come to comprehend and perceive the analogue, i.e. how things are in their spiritual G -dly root above. (It is for this reason that the anthropomorphic analogy of man has been used throughout this book, and throughout Chassidus and Kabbalah. However, one must be very cautious to always contemplate and distinguish the vast difference between the analogy and the analogue. Otherwise, there is a danger that one may fall into the worst depths of confusion and false notions.) 12 As explained (in chapters 27 -31), the aspects of the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah of the soul are the inner, pervading lights of the soul which become limited within the vessels and organs of the body (the brain, the heart and the liver which are the chief organs, including all the subsidiary organs). However, the aspect of the Chayah, which is the essen tial source of the intellect and is called, “The Potential Power to conceptualize – Koach HaMaskeel ” and the Yechidah, which is the aspect of the essential pleasure and desire of the soul, do not vest or become limited within the vessels and organs of the body. Rather, these are the encompassing lights of the soul. However, this does not mean that their radiance and light does not permeate or reach the vessels and organs of the brain, heart and liver etc. Rather, it only means that there is no particular vessel which limits and defines them. (In contrast, Chochmah actually vests and becomes limited within the right hemisphere of the brain, and Binah actually vests and becomes limited within the left hemisphere (i.e. the Neshamah ). Likewise, the heartfelt emotions vest within and become limited within the heart (i.e. the Ruach ) etc. This is not the case with the encompassing lights, which encompass all the vessels and “organs” equally.) This is because, as will be explained later in this chapter, even th e simple essential desire of the essence of the soul radiates within even the most external aspects of the vessel of the heart. 13 ...and the Nefesh in the Liver, as previously explained. 14 As explained in previous chapters (primarily 25 and 26), the true sou rce of the intellect is actually in the inner aspect of Keter , which is the pleasure of it ( Atik Yomin ). This is to say that the Light of Chochmah , which is the flash of insight, comes from the “Hidden Pleasure – Taanug HaNe’elam ” which is brought about t hrough the sublimation (the Koach Ma”H ) of Chochmah to its essential so urce. Hence, there is a radiance of the encompassing light of the pleasure and desire (the Yechidah ) within the potential power to conceptualize – the Koach HaMaskeel (the Chayah ). Fr om the potential power to conceptualize – Koach HaMaskeel , the flashes of insight of Chochmah come into the vessel of the brain. The flash of insight then"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"comprehension ( Binah ) of the brain, the emotional arousal in the heart is drawn down. This is to say that the thirty -two chambers of the bra in, which are called the “thirty -two pathways of Binah ”, open up to become the intellect of Zeir Anpin . 15 This is because the Intellect ( Mochin ) divides into four, i.e. Chochmah, Binah, Chessed and Gevurah . Each one of these [four] has eight chambers with in it, which totals thirty -two. 16 It       enters into the comprehension of Binah , wherein the insight is analyzed and comprehended in a way of a “something” i.e. through tangible explanation s and reasoning. Then, from the externality ( NeHi”Y ) of Chochmah and Binah, it is drawn down to affect an arousal of the heartfelt emotions. 15 See Zohar ( Idra Rabba ) Naso 128b, 129a & 136a. 16 In Zohar and Etz Chaim it is explained that the four compartments and Parshiyot of the Tefilin of the head correspond to the four brains of Chochmah , Binah , Chessed , and Gevurah . The primary aspects of the brains are the aspects of Chochmah and Binah (which are the Pars hiyot of Ka desh and V’Hayah Ki Y’Viyecha . The Parshiyot of Shma and V’Hayah Im Shamo’a are the two brains of Chessed and Gevurah which divide in Da’at. ) Actually, the brains are divided into the three primary aspects of Chochmah, Binah and Da’at . Howeve r, when there is a radiance of the depth of comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ) then Da’at divides into the two aspects of Chessed and Gevurah . This may be understood through an analogy in man below. We clearly observe that when an intellectual concept is ac tually influenced from an influencer to a recipient (as in a teacher \\student relationship) there are additional particulars and details that become apparent, which were not noticeable as th is intellectual concept originally existed in t he mind of the influ encer. As the concept existed in the mind of the influencer, it was in short form, and was not yet divide d into many parts ands details. Now, we fin d that some people are capab le of giving over and explaining intellectual con cepts to those below their own intellectual level , through the use of analogies and explanations, u ntil the light of the concept is grasped by the recipient. However, there are others who are incapable of giving over and explaining concepts, even though they themselves grasp them. This is to say that though he grasps the subject clearly in his own mind, nonetheless, he is incapable of bringing the co ncept down to a recipient who is on a lower intellectual level than himself. The reason for this is because this ability is dependant upon the Omek HaMoosag – The Depth of his own comprehension of the concept , as explained before. A person who has a great depth in to the concept will be able to bring down the con cept and break it down into smaller and smaller particulars , in a logical orde r, through the use of many analogies , which act as a “gar ment” in which the concept is vested etc. However, a person who has a shallow depth in his own understanding of the concept only comprehend s the matt er as it is (i.e. as it was ex plained to him or h ow he understood the subject, in and of itself etc). Therefore, though he may understand it, nev ertheless, because he only grasps the concept in short form, there are no division s into particulars and details. He only grasps it in a general way and is the refore incapable of bri nging it down to a recipient by bringing out all the particulars and details of the concept through a logical order of many explanations and analogies etc. From the above it is clearl y understood that the abundance of division int o the many particulars and details of the concept being conveyed, comes about specifically because of the Omek HaMoosag – The depth of comprehension, which is the flash o f insight and understanding, which comes from t he source and potential power to concep tualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ) from which all concepts arise. In other words, a person who has great depth in to a concept will be capable of bringing it down so that even a small child will comprehend it. In contrast, a person who does not have such great dep th will not be capable of dividing the subject into many particulars and details or to invest it into many allegories, since he only grasps it in a general, abbreviated fashion . From all of the above , it is understood that it is spec ifically a person who has a Da’at into the Omek HaMoosag (i.e. an intellectual connection and feeling for the essential d epth and source of the concept, which itself is but a radiance from the power to conceptualize - Koach HaMaskeel of Arich Anpin ) who has the power to divid e the concept into its various particulars ( Chessed and Gevurah ). "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"       However, at first Chessed and Gevurah are included withou t any division whatsoever. This is to say that there cannot yet be any revelation o f the particulars from the general , abbreviate d light which is grasped. In other words, at this point there is only a small radiance of the intellect of Chochmah and Binah without much depth. However, once a person grasps the depth of the concept and receives a radiance of the intangible essence whic h comes from the power to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ) itself, then Da’at splits into its particular s, i.e. Chessed and Gevurah , which are the intellectual leanings towards either Chessed – Kindness or Gevurah – Sternness (as will be ex plained). Howeve r, without the radiance of the depth into Da’at , it could not divide into the two brains of Chessed or Gevurah , but would , rather, include them together, similar to a person who grasps a concept, as it is, in a general , abbreviated fashion without division s or intellectual leanings into the particular details and specifics of the matter . However, when there is a radiance of the depth of the concept, then the brain of Da’at divides into Chessed and Gevurah , thus bringing about four brains ; Chochmah, Binah, Chessed and Gevurah . These four further sub divi de into thirty -two, as will be explained. Now, these two aspects of Chessed and Gevurah of Da’at are not actual emotions. Rather, in truth they are intellectual brains. Furthermore, it must be pointed out t hat when Da’at is divided into the two aspects of Chessed and Gevurah , it itself is not include d in the count. (In other words , there are only four brains, not five .) This is because the two brains of Chessed and Gevurah are Da’at itself. This is becaus e Da’at is the aspect of the intermediary between Chochmah , Binah , Chessed, and Gevurah , since it includes all of them wit hin itself. It is only before the division of Da’at into Chessed and Gevurah that it is counted as the third brain, i.e. Chochmah, Bi nah and Da’at . We must now understand how Da’at divides into the two brains of Chessed and Gevurah . Moreover, as known, the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah are usually referred to as emotional sefirot ( Midot ) rather than intellectual brains ( Mochin ). How is it that here they are brains ? However , the explana tion of the matter is that the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah which branch out of Da’at constitute the two primary intellectual leanings, towards either Chessed – Kindness, or Gevurah – Sternness. This is similar to two opposing methodologies or opinions, such as the methodology of Beit Shamai as opposed to the methodology of Beit Hillel . L ikewise , this is the case regarding every dispute between Torah Scholars, i.e. that one rules st ringently and proh ibits, while the other rules leniently in regard to the same case and permit s. This is beca use the intellect of one Torah scholar leans towards Chessed – Kindness, while the intellect of the other leans towards Gevurah – Sternness. All this depends on th e brain of Da’at , which is called “the Leaning Da’at – Da’at Noteh ”. This is because Da’at has the power to cause the intelle ct and reasoning to lean either towards kindness and merit ( Chessed ), or towards its opposite, which is judgment and liability ( Ge vurah ). Moreover, the measure and proportions of these intellectual leanings depends specifically on the brain of Da’at also. This is clearly observable in a judge who must “weigh” the merits or demerits in a matter of law. S ometimes his Da’at (his intel lectual connection to the matter) will lean towards merit and he will find reason to acquit the defendant etc, while at other times his intellectual leaning will lean towards severity and he will find reason to find the defendant guilty. Similarly, there may be two Torah Scholars who both delve in to the same matter, and the intellect of one will lean towards merit, while the intellect of the other will lean towards liability. Furthermore, this matter may actually be found within a single individual. A t times he will lean towards kindness while at other times he will lean towards judgment. As mentioned before, a n example of this is that before the flood the Torah states that G - d “saw that the ev il of man was great” and decided to destroy them. However, after the flood i t states that G -d saw , “that the heart of man is evil from his youth” and he pledged to never again destroy the world . From this we see that there can be two opposite leanings in the very same intellect and reasoning, according to the des ire. We , therefore , find that the brain of Da’at is divided into the two intellectual brains of Chessed and Gevurah . Thus, when Da’at is divided into Chessed and Gevurah there are a total of four intellectual brains of Chochmah, Binah, Chessed and Gevura h . Now, after the intellect is divided into four chambers Chochmah, Binah, Chessed and Gevurah (corresponding to the four sections and Parshiyot of the Tefilin of the head), each chamber then further subdivides into eight subsequent chambers, correspondin g to the eight letters of the two names Havayah"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"       ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), which are the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah . This is because, as known, the name Havayah represents Chessed and the name Ado”nay represents Gevurah . The reason for this division is because each of the above mentioned four bra ins also includes Chessed and Gevurah in general. Thus, there are the eight letters of these two names within each of the four brains mentioned above. Now, fou r times eight equals thirty -two. These are the thirty -two chambers of the brain or the thirty -two pathways which open and descend to become the intellect of Zeir Anpin (the actual heartfelt emotions). This may be understood according to what was said above regarding the aspect of Da’at which causes the intellect to lean towards Chessed -Kindness et c. Included within Chessed -Kindness of Da’at is also the aspect of Gevurah -Sternness. This is because it is not an essential, absolute kindness, but is rather a composite. Therefore, although there is a leaning towards kindness , which is its dominant cha racteristic, none theless, there is als o an element of sternness. This is called Gevurah of Chessed – Sternness of Kindness. Thus, we find that both names, Havayah ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), which are the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah, are present in the brain of Chessed . Likewise, included within Gevurah of Da’at is also the aspect of Chessed . This is because it too is not an essential quality of absolute sternne ss, but is rather a compos ite which leans towards Sternness . Therefore , because it is a composite , to a degree the quality of Kindness exists there as well. This is called Chessed of Gevurah – Kindness of Sternness. Hence, we find that both names, Havaya h ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), which are the aspects of Chessed and Gevurah, are present in the brain of Gevurah , as well. These are the aspects of the particular inter -inclusions of Chessed and Gevurah in each of the two general brains of Chessed and Gevura h . Likewise, it is understood that each of the two general brains of Chochmah and Binah also possess the two names of Havayah ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), except that it is more general. (The reason it is more general is because these are the first divis ions of Chessed and Gevurah , while in the brains of Chessed and Gevurah which themselves are already divided into two, the subdivisions and inter -inclusions of Chessed and Gevurah within them are more particular.) As is known, the brain of Chochmah is an aspect of the kindnesses ( Chassadim ) of the right line, Chochmah, Chessed, Netzach . The brain of Binah , in contras t, is an aspect of the severities ( Gevurot ) of the left line of Binah, Gevurah and Hod . Furthermore, both Chochmah and Binah each include Ch essed and Gevurah , as explained above at length. (That is, Chessed of Chochmah also includes Gevurah , and Gevurah of Binah also includes Chessed .) Therefore, the eight letters of the two names of Havayah ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), which represent Chess ed and Gevurah , are found in both Chochmah and Binah as well. These emotions, Chessed and Gevurah of the intellect of Chochmah and Binah were explained above in chapter 26 at length. That is, when a person is unable to brin g out a reasoning and comprehen dible explanation for his position, but is , nonetheless , unwilling to accept the opposite position, because his intellect leans in this way , this is the aspect of Chessed and Gevurah of Abba , as it is before it radiates from the “nothing” into the “somethi ng” of Binah – Comprehension. An example of this is the Talmudic story in which , “Rav was s ilent” and could not bring out a logical reasoning to support his intelle ctual position. Similarly, it wa s explained that Beit Shammai who generally rule stringently , were spiritually rooted in Gevurah of Chochmah , while Beit Hillel , who generally rule leniently , were spiritually rooted in Chessed of Chochmah . It was also explained in chapter 26 that Chessed and Gevurah of Binah are the leanings of the comprehension, with sou nd reasoning and explanation either for merit or demerit (and receive from Chessed and Gevurah of Chochmah , as explained there). This is to say that they are the reasoning of the intellect either toward kindness or sternness . However, according to the above explanation, what is the difference between Chessed and Gevurah of Binah and the brains of Chessed and Gevurah which subdivide out of “The L eaning Da’at ”? The explanation of this is that Da’at is what mediates between the two intellectual rea sons of Chessed and Gevurah of the comprehension of Binah , causing it to further lean towards either Chessed or Gevurah . This is similar to the aforementioned matter of the verses which state that G - d “saw that the evil of man was great” etc. In other wo rds , there were two opposite intellectual r easonings , which came out of the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"is for this reason that [the heart] is called Lev – Heart ( לב ), because its source is in the thirty - two pathways ( ל \" ב שבילין ), which are the thirty -two chambers. 17 It is through them that Da’at , which includes Chessed and Gevurah , causes the light of the intellect of Chochmah and Binah to lean [and] be aroused [either] towards Chessed or Gevurah , i.e. towards merit or towards judgment. These are also called the emotions of the intellect, which are the seven lower [ sefirot ] of Binah , each of which includes seven . These are the fifty gates of Binah . [H owever, ] al l this is one [related] matter , 18 except that the fifty gates of Binah       same matter , as previously explained. I t is Da’at which causes them to lean, sometimes towards kindnes s and sometimes towards sternness . From all of the above it is understood tha t there are four chambers in the brain, which are; Chochmah, Binah, Chessed and Gevurah . In each of these four brains there are the eight letters of the two names of Havayah ( הוי \" ה ) and Ado”nay ( אדנ \" י ), which are the particular leanings towards Chessed an d Gevurah . Four times eight equals thirty -two. These are the thirty two chambers or pathways of the brain which become revealed in the heart. (Now, when these thirty -two divisions are still completely concealed within Chochmah they are called “the thirt y t wo passagewa ys of Chochmah – Lamed Beit Netivot HaChochmah ”. When the thirty -two become more revealed in Binah they are called “the thirty two pathways of Binah – Lamed Beit Shveelin D’Binah ”. When they become fully revealed in Da’at they are called “ the thirty two chambers of Da’at – Lamed Beit Chadarei Da’at ”. When these then descend to be aroused as actual emotions in the heart, the heart is then called the Lev – לב , which has the same spelling and numerical value of 32.) See Ateret Rosh of Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch, Shaar Yom HaKipurim , Chapters 5 & 6. Also s ee the Siddur of the Alter Rebbe, Shaar Tefillin. 17 As mentioned before, the numerical value of the Hebrew word for heart – Lev ( לב ) is 32. This, then, is the reason why the heart is called Lev – לב , because it is the 32 lights of the intellect which spread forth into the heart to cause an arousal of the heartfelt emotions. (See Etz Chaim , Shaar 31, Chapter 4.) 18 There are two general explanations and calculations of the “Fifty Gates of Bin ah – Nun Shaarim D’Binah ”. It is explained in various places that the reason there are fifty gates in Binah is because the light of Binah spreads forth into the five emotionial sefirot of Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod of Binah . Since each of these emotional Sefirot consists of ten subdivisions, there are a total of fifty subdivisions. The second explanation (which is the one given here in this chapter) is that this refers to the seven emotional sefirot of Binah , each of which includes seven sub -emotions. This creates a total of 49 gates. (The point and depth of the comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ) of Binah is called the fiftieth gate (which includes and surpasses all the other forty -nine gates, and is therefore counted separately.) The differ ence between these two explanations will soon be explained.) These are called, “The emotions of the intellect and comprehension” themselves. For example, this is similar to the arousal of the quality of love as it still is included within the essence of the comprehension. This is to say that upon a person’s comprehension of a matter with a well reasoned explanation etc, his mind itself immediately becomes aroused. This is called a “gate”, similar to a gate which is opened to the outside, through which one may exit or enter. Likewise, the arousal of the emotions of love and awe (or f ear) of the intellect itself is called the “gates of Binah ” which either allow s the emotions of the heart to come up and expand the intellect within the mind, or for the em otions of the mind to descend down to the heart and arouse the emotions, as is explained elsewhere at length. Now, the difference between the two ways of enumerating the fifty gates of Binah ( Nun Shaarim ) may be understood as follows: The first explanati on is that the five emotional sefirot of Binah (i.e. Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod ) each include ten sefirot , thus totaling fifty “gates”. The reason for this is that the main essence of the emotions is specifically the five sefirot of Chesse d, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod. This accords with the statement of the Zohar ( Tikkunim 6b) that, “ Binah only spreads forth until Hod ”, which is called Hod of Imma . Binah does not spread forth further than this. The reason is because the aspect of Yesod of Binah is"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"       not an actual defined emotion, but is only the aspect of the revelation and influence of the emotions that are above it, from the brain to the heart. This is in accordance with what was previously explained (and what will be explained at length later) that the aspect of Yesod is only the spreading forth of the influence of the five emotional sefirot which precede it. (In truth, however, the statement “ Binah only spreads forth until Hod ” mainly refers to the fact that Binah spreads forth o nly until the aspect of Hod of Zeir Anpin (the heartfelt emotions). It is for this reason that Yesod of Zeir Anpin is called, “An orphan from his mother ( Binah ) but not from his father ( Chochmah )”, as will be explained later at great length. Nevertheless , this statement of the Zohar also applies to the matter of the 50 gates of Binah as well.) Now, each of these five emotional sefirot ( Midot ) of Binah includes ten, which therefore equals fifty. That is, there are ten gates of Chessed , ten of Gevurah , te n of Tiferet , ten of Netzach and ten of Hod . In this case, the three intellectual sefirot (not just the seven emotional sefirot ) are included in each of these five emotions of Binah . The reason for this, and also the reason there is not yet any influence from Yesod, is because the fifty gates of Binah as they are at this point, are still totally included and bound up with the essential depth and point of the comprehension. This is to say that this way of enumerating of the fifty gates, refers to the emot ions of Binah as they are when there is an inner unification of Chochmah and Binah , as the person is grasping and perceiving the depth of the comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ). On this level all fifty gates are counted (because, as mentioned previously, the f iftieth gate refers to the Omek HaMoosag – The depth of the comprehension), and each of the five emotional sefirot includes the three intellectual sefirot as well. Moreover, beca use his mind is totally preoccupied and involved in the intellectual sight an d perception of the essential depth of the concept, there is not yet any spreading forth of these intellectual emotions. Rather, they are still totally included within the sublimation and perception of the depth. This is the more inner aspect of the fifty “gates” and emotions of Binah , as they are included (and still concealed) within the depth of the comprehension of the three upper sefirot of the intellect ( ChaBa”D ). However, this is not the case regarding the second way of enumerating the fifty “gates” of Binah . That is, there are seven emotional sefirot of Binah , each of which include seven, thus totaling forty -nine. On this level, Yesod and Malchut , which are the aspects of the spreading forth of the emotions of the intellect of Binah, indeed, are c ounted. Moreover, the three intellectual sefirot (i.e. the fiftieth “gate”) are separate and apart, and therefore removed from the equation. In other words, on this level the inner aspects of Chochmah and Binah are separate and the person is no longer ha ving a flash of insight into the depth of the concept etc. Because of this, the emotional sefirot of Binah are no longer receiving the influence of the flash of insight of the depth of the comprehension from Keter, Chochmah and Binah . Therefore, the sefi rot of Yesod and Malchut are now counted, because, the influence which was previously received from the intellectual sefirot, now spreads forth and is drawn down to bring about an actual arousal of the emotions, or to bring the explanations of the concept out to a recipient or to apply it in action etc. This was not the case, in the inner level of the fifty gates, while his mind was totally and completely sublimated to the essential depth of the concept and was preoccupied with receiving influence from Cho chmah . Thus, the se two aspects of the fifty gates of Binah refer to the emotions of the intellect and comprehension as they are on two different levels. The first is how they are as they go up to receive from the depth of the intellect, and the second is how they are when they separate from the depth of the comprehension and essence of the intellect. Now that we have understood the difference between these two enumerations of the fifty gates and how they are not in contradiction to each other, it must , nevertheless , be understood that these emotions are not yet actual heartfelt emotions at all, bu t are still the “emotions of intellect and comprehension ”. This is to say that these are intellectual emotions which are born of comprehension. An example o f this is the aspect of Hod of Binah . The word Hod means acknowledgement or admission . This is the aspect of the acknowledgement or admission which comes about solely due to intellect, specifically through comprehension and reasoning. For example, this could be the acknowledgement of creation ex nihilo (Something from nothing) which comes about through deep contemplation and reasoning ( Hitbonenut ), even though he does not perceive this with his physical eyes. In other words, through one’s comprehension he will acknowledge and admit to the fact that it is the light of G -d which creates and vitalizes all entities"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"still are within the comprehension of Binah , such as the “Kindnesses which are concealed within Yesod of Imma ”. 19 In other words, this is the aspect of the arousal of love as it still is within intellect and comprehension. It is [thus] considered to be “co ncealed” and “hidden” within comprehension. Afterwards, it comes out into revelation as an actual arousal of the att ribute of love within the heart , which is called Zeir Anpin . In this fashion , the aforementioned t hirty -two pathways come out in a reve aled way in the heart from the concealed arousal of the brain, and it is for this reason that it is called “ Lev – Heart”. This is in accordance with what is stated in Etz Chaim , 20 that the reason it is called “ Lev ” is because the thirty -two lights of Abba and Imma gather there. These are the thirty -two pathways. (These are the thirty - two [times that it states,] “ VaYomer Elokim – and G - d said” , which [refers to] Binah , as it receives from Ab ba 21 ) as is explained elsewhere at length.       etc. similar to how it is , specifically, the soul which is the life force and vitality of the body . This matter is clear in his mind’s eye even t hough he cannot see it with his physical eyes. For example, when two people are debating and one person grasps the truth of his opponent’s reasoning, he will have to admit i ntellectually and acknowledge the truth of the other person’s position. If he d id not recognize the truth of the other position, he would not, at all, admit to the truth of it. This is called Hod of Binah , which is the intellectual acknowledgment and admission that comes from the comprehension and reasoning. ( Hod of Chochmah, in co ntrast, is acknowledgment and admission higher than reasoning. For example, this is like the acknowledgment and admission to a miracle which occurs right before his very eyes. Even though he cannot comprehend it whatsoever, and it is beyond his understan ding, he nevertheless is forced to admit to its truth etc.) Now, Hod of Hod of Binah is the acknowledgment of the acknowledgment. This is to say that he acknowledges the fact that he must acknowledge. An example of this is an ignorant person who admits that he must acknowledge and submit to the rulings of the Torah Scholar. Another example is a person who admits that he must acknowledge the prescriptions of a medical doctor etc. Now, this is not yet an actual emotion or even an intellectual emotion whi ch spreads forth into action etc. As of yet, it is entirely an intellectual emotion and has not yet come forth into revelation in the heart or in action etc. Rather, it is specifically through the thirty two pathways of Da’at that these emotions of Binah are brought forth to be revealed in the heart etc. (This is because, as previously explained, it is possible for two opposite logical constructs to come out of th e same matter, and it is specifically the aspect of Da’at which causes the mind to lean, som etimes towards kindness and sometimes towards judgment. The fifty gates of Binah may be viewed as all the possible intellectual conclusions ( Tamtzit ) and leanings that may be reached through contemplation and comprehension, whereas the thirty -two pathwa ys or chambers of ( Chessed and Gevurah of) Da’at are what cause the actual leaning towards one thing or another etc.) Thus, as these emotions still exist in the fifty gates of Binah , they are entirely intellectual (such as all the various logical argument s and position of the Talmud ). In contrast, as they spread forth into Da’at to become the intellect of the heartfelt emotions, there is already an emotional decision and leaning towards one way or the other way (such as the actual legal rulings of the Shu lchan Aruch ). Thus, it is specifically the thirty -two pathways which cause the intellect to lean and therefore descend, giving rise to actual heartfelt emotions. It is specifically for this reason that it is called the Lev - לב . ( See Pardes Rimonim from Ra bbi Moshe Cordovero (the Ramak), Shaar 13, and Perush HaMilot from Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, p. 99a, and Imrei Binah from Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, Shaar HaTefilin p120c and on . ) 19 See Likkutei Torah, Bamidbar 6d. 20 See Etz Chaim , Shaar 31 ( Shaar Partzuf ei Zu”N ), Chapter 4. See also Ma’amarei Admor Ha’Emtzaee , Dvarim , Volume 3, page 994. This matter has already been explained in previous footnotes. 21 It was explained before that the first word of the Torah, “ Bereshit – In the Beginning ( בראשית )”, is translated into Aramaic as “ B’Chochmeta – With Wisdom” which is the aspect of Abba ( Chochmah ). Later in the book, it will be explained that the name Elokim relates to the aspect of Imma ( Binah ). Thus the thirty - two times that it states “ VaYo mer Elokim – And G - d said”, refers to the unification of Abba ( Chochmah ) and Imma ( Binah ), which is called “The creation of something out of nothing”, as previously explained at length (See chapter 25 and other places throughout). These are called the “ La med -Beit Netivot Chochmah – The Thirty Two Passageways of Chochmah ”, which become revealed in the “ Lamed -Beit"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" Now, certainly, in order for there to be an arousal of an emotion in the heart from the con cealed arousal of that emotion as it exists in the intellect and comprehension of Binah , there must first be an aspect of a Tzimtzum , concealment and gathering, which is called a withdrawal. 22 (This is analogous to a seed decaying so that there can be a transformation from one [state of] being to a different [state of] being, as known. 23 ) This [ Tzimtzum - lessening] is the asp ect of the “Narrowness of the N eck – Meitzar HaGaron ” of Binah , in which the arousal of the intellect bec omes concealed, and is drawn down as an arou sal in the heart through a transformation of [its state of] being . (This is similar to the aspect of the “ Air y Membrane – Krooma D’Avirah ” which conceals and se parates between the upper power which transcends intellect , [and the intellect], so that it may be rev ealed as the light of the intellect through a transformation of [its state of] being . 24 It is also s imilar to the “ Diaphragm – Chatzer HaKaved ” which divides and separates between the respiratory system and the digestive system in order to bring about a transformation of [the state of] being , as is explained elsewhere at length. 25 )       Shvilin D’Binah – The Thirty Two Pathways of Binah ”, which open up to the “ Lamed - Beit Chadarei Da’at – The Thirty Two Chambers of Da’at ”, which de scend to become the intellect of the heartfelt emotions of the heart – Lev ( ל \" ב – which has a numerical value of thirty -two). This was explained in previous footnotes at length. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra , Vol.2, Page 625, and Dvarim, Vol. 2 , Page 651.) 22 This means that in order for there to be a change from intellect to emotions, there must be a qualitative lessening, i.e. a Tzimtzum . This is to say that there must be a restraint and cessation of the intellect to bring about the possibilit y of heartfelt emotions, which are of lesser quality. Otherwise, if the intellect was to radiate without cessation, nothing lower than the intellect, such as the heartfelt emotions, could be revealed. Allegorically, this Tzimtzum -lessening is analogous t o the “Narrowness of the Neck – Meitzar HaGaron ” which exists between the brain and the heart. Similarly, above, there is a Tzimtzum (A narrowing or constraint) between the intellectual sefirot of Chochmah and Binah of the world of Atzilut and the emotion al sefirot of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . (Moreover, just as in the first Tzimtzum, an impression remained, within which the entire Infinite Light was included, so too, an impression remains from this Tzimtzum, within which the entire light of the intellect is “impressed” so to speak. The arousal of the heartfelt emotions comes from this impression of the intellect which is passed on to the heart.) 23 In other words, when a seed is planted in the ground, before it can grow into an actual tree, the seed must fir st decay. In other words, there must first be a “decay” and “withdrawal” of its first state of being in order for the transformation into a new state of being to take place. (See Tanya 113a, and Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Vayikra Vol.2, Page 598.) 24 As explained at the end of Chapter Twenty One, there is a separation between the inner aspect of Keter of Keter and Chochmah of Keter , about which the Torah hints, “And the curtain shall be for you as a separation between the holy and the holy of holies” . It was explained there that this is the aspect of the “ Krooma D’Aveera – The Airy Membrane” which exists between the “ Gulgulta – The Skull” (referring to Keter ) and the “ Mocha – The Brain” (referring to Chochmah ). This is because it is necessary for there t o be a Tzimtzum -lessening and separation between the upper level and the lower level, so that the lower level, which is qualitatively lower, may have existence and be revealed, as explained there. The same principle is true here, in our case, in regard to the Tzimtzum of the “ Meitzar HaGaron – The Narrowness of the Neck” which separates and creates a Tzimtzum between the intellect and the heartfelt emotions, thus making it possible for heartfelt emotions to come into being. (See Zohar ( Idra Rabba ) Naso 12 8b, and footnotes 45 and 46 of Chapter 21.) 25 Just as there is a separation and Tzimtzum between the aspects of the Brain and the Heart, there must, likewise, also be a Tzimtzum between the aspects of the Heart and the Liver. This Tzimtzum is called the “ Chatzer HaKaved – The Diaphragm” (literally, “The Courtyard of the Liver”), which separates between the heart and the liver. This brings about a transformation from heartfelt emotions to gut emotions and actions etc."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, the emot ions of the heart are patterned after the emotions of the intellect , literally . They are literally according to how they were aroused in the brain, with out any deviation whatsoever , even the “thorn of the letter Yod ” , 26 as known. 27 The only exception is that in the heart they come about through a transformation of their [state of] being , according to the limitation and restraint of Netzach and Hod of Binah , which constitute the sending forth of the influence of the light of the essential comprehension, for the sole purpose of arousing the emotions, as known. 28 Now, included in the emotions of the heart are the three levels of ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y . 29 These are the “ Mooskal – The Intellect [of the Emotions]”, the “ Moorgash – The Felt [arousal of the emo tions]” and the “ Mootba – The Natural [Response of the Emotions]” , which were mentioned previousl y. 30 Each of these consists of three vessels; inner , mid dle, and external, as explained previously at length. 31 However, even the aspect of the externality of the vessels of NeHi”Y of the heart, which is the aspect of the arousal of the kindness and love of the heart as it comes to be [expressed] as influence to the outside, which is called NeHi”Y of the chest [as it is expressed] within the Thought, Speech and Action , which comes [about] through the externality of the vessel of the heart , which is the aspect of the “ Mootba – The Natural [response of the emotions]” of the breath of the chest of Zeir Anpin of [the world of] Atzilut , about which it states, 32 “He and His organs are one” , is [nonetheless] all still in an aspect of Infinity ( Ein Sof ).   26 This expression means “even the tini est amount”. An equivalent English idiom would be, “Even to a hair’s breadth”. 27 In other words, the arousal of the heartfelt emotions is, literally , exactly according to the arousal of the intellect. If he is boiling with anger in his heart, it is a cer tainty that in his brain, he was boiling with the same anger etc. Because of this, when a person becomes angry in his heart, we try to distra ct his attention and cause him to think about something else etc, so that the anger in his heart will subside . This is because the arousal of the heart is exactly according to the arousal of the brain. There is absolutely no divergence. The same is true of all the other heartfelt emotions, such as love or fear. They are patterned exactly according to the arous al of the emotions of the intellect. 28 In other words, certainly there is a great difference between the intellect and the emotions of the heart, in that the emotions of the heart are of a much lesser quality. This is because the heart only receives a rad iance of the intellect in a very limited fashion, through a Tzimtzum -lessening, as explained above. Moreover, the heart does not receive the actual essence of the intellect itself, but only its light as it spreads forth ( NeHi”Y ) to arouse the emotions, as explained in chapter twenty -six. Nevertheless, the composition of the heartfelt emotions will be exactly according to their composition in the intellect, with no change whatsoever, as explained above. 29 These are the nine sefirot of Zeir Anpin (the heart felt emotions) which each include nine sefirot totaling eight -one as explained in chapter thirty at length. 30 These are the three levels of the innerness, intermediate and externality of the vessel of the heart. The innerness is the aspect of ChaBa”D of t he vessel of the heart, which is the aspect of the sublimation ( Bitul ) of the heart to the brain from which it receives. The intermediate is the aspect of ChaGa”T which is the actual arousal of the heartfelt emotions themselves in a felt manner ( Moorgash ). That is, it is still the spiritual feeling of love or repulsion etc. of the heart. The externality is the aspect of NeHi”Y which is the spreading forth of these emotions ( Hitpashtoot ), as previously explained. This is similar to the natural responses of the emotions, such as hyperventilation or rapid heartbeat etc. as explained at length in chapter thirty. These three aspects are called the “ Mooskal – The Intellect of the Emotions”, the “ Moorgash – The Felt Arousal of the E motions” and the “ Mootba – The Natural Response of the Emotions” . (Also see the explanations of the Ravad and the Ramban on Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishna 5.) 31 9 x 9 = 81 x 3 = 243 + 5 (kindnesses) = 248 “Limbs” of Zeir Anpin . 32 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" By way of analogy, this is similar to man below. When the essential desire, which is in an aspect of the encompassing [light] of the aforementioned Yechidah [of the soul ], radiates and comes into revelation in the brains of Chochmah and Binah to the point that it descends and constricts within the “smallness” of the brains of Netzach and Hod of Chessed , as it is felt in the heart, which is the breath of the chest, we find that even there, the [essen tial] desire radiates. This is because, as we observe , the desire is felt even in the breath of the heart. This is called , “ Re’oota D’Leeba – The Desire of the Heart”, 33 which is the fact that his heart lusts in a felt way for s omething good, and loathes that which is bad and despised, through the absence of desire [for it] in the heart. This being the case , [ we find that] there is a n instantaneous unification and bo nd between the [original] sour ce of the essential desire to the [external] breath of the heart, as if they are literally one entity. 34 Through this analogy we may understand the Upper Man, which is the aspect of Zeir Anpin . Regarding the heart of Zeir Anpin it states, 35 “And He said unto His heart”, causing it to lean towar d Kindness. Likewise, [a different verse states, 36 ] “And He saddened His heart ”, [causing it to lean] toward Judgment, and the like. We find that within the aspect of the externality of the vessel of Netzach and Hod of this heart , there is a radiance of the aspect of the simple essential desire of the Essence of the Infinite Light which preceded the first Tzimtzum . ([This aspect] was mentioned previously in chapter ten, in regard to the aspects of Yachid and Echad etc, through the analogy of the esse ntial desire for kindness [as it exists] with in th e essence of the [human] soul etc.) This being the case even up to the aspect of the externality of the heart of Zeir Anpin , it is still completely considered to be the end of the World of the Infinite ( Olam HaEin Sof ). This is because , “He and His organs are one ” just as in man whose heart is one with his essential desire . This will suffice for those of understanding. 37 End of Chapter Thirty Two   33 See Zoha r VaYera 100a. 34 Although there are a multitude of particular levels and intermediate aspects between the essential Yechidah of the soul and the externality of the heartfelt emotions, nonetheless, even the most external aspect of the heartfelt emotions is literally one with the essence of the soul, and is not at all separate from it. Moreover, the essential light of the soul radiates all the way to even the most external aspect of the heartfelt emotions, as if all the intermediate levels were transparent. The reaction, such as rapid heartbeat, is instantaneous, and to the person experiencing it, it cannot be distinguished as something separate and apart from himself. This is, likewise, the relationship between Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut (Emanation ) and the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) . In other words, even the most external aspect of NeHi”Y of Zeir Anpin is still totally bound up with the Singularity of the Essence of the Infinite Light which preceded the Tzimtzum , as if th ey are literally one entity. 35 Genesis 8:21 36 Genesis 6:6 37 In the beginning of the chapter the Rebbe stated that , “Even up to the aspect of the vessels of Zeir Anpin , in the aspect of the externality of NeHi”Y which is within it, is still considered to be of the end of the world of the Infinite ” . It is clearly understood from all of the above (and all of the preceding chapters) that there is a total and complete unity between even the most external aspects of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut and the very Essence of G- d. It is not at all separate from Him, but rather, is literally one with Him, just as a person’s heartfelt emotions are literally one with the essential emotions of the essence of his soul. In the continuing chapters the Rebbe will continue to explain G- d’s unity through the entire chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut )."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty Three From all of the above 1 we understand the matter of a single Hitbonenut -cont emplation of the many particulars which come together as one general [overarching principle] that includes them all . This is similar to [the matter of] “ Whatever HaShem desires He has done in the heavens and the earth etc”. 2 The root of this “desire of HaShem ” is rooted in the first source (which is called Yachid – Singular etc). This is the aspect of the essential Heyulie desire for kindness in the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) which is [an] absolutely simple [singularity] . This [d esire for kindness] is similar to the essential ly good and kind nature embedded in the essence of t he soul (as explained above in chapter ten). Once it arose in G - d’s will and desire to bestow goodness in a particular way from this general heyulie light , 3 [this desire] descended with a great chaining down . [Nonetheless], a ll [this was] still within Himself [and was still] in the aspect of Infinity ( Ein Sof ), until this desire reached the aspects of Netzach and Hod of the externality of the vessel of the “ Heart”. In o ther words, [it reached ] the external emotions ( Midot ) of Malchut of the Infinite ( Ain Sof ), even though as it is there, [ in Malchut of Ein Sof ] it complet ely transcends the aspect of limitations of lights within vessels. Rather, i t all is literally in an aspect of Infinity ( Ein Sof ), as “He estimated it within Himself ”. 4 Afterwards , there was a Tzimtzum [withdrawal] and it descended by means of the aspect of the Line ( Kav ) with in the ten sefirot of Circles ( Igullim ) etc, until the aspect of Keter of Adam Kadmon . 5 [ Now, Keter of Adam Kadmon ] is the source of the concealed desire ( Ratzon HaNe’elam) which becomes revealed as the “desire for the desire” with in Keter of Atik Yomin   1 This refers to all the preceding chapters (at least from ten through thirty two). To clearly comprehend this chapter to its depth, the reader must be profi cient in all those chapters. This is because here the Rebbe explains the entire chaining down and unification ( Yichud ) from the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) until the externality of the emotions of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , in a short form. At this point in the book it is expected that the reader is proficient in all of these concepts and their terms. For example, if the term “ Yachid ” is mentioned, it should immediately conjure in one’s mind the entire explanation of what this means, or if the terms “ Atik Yomin or Arich Anpin ” are mentioned he should clearly know and understand both the analogies and the analogue of what these matters are. However, if the previous chapters are not clearly understood, it is highly recommended to go bac k and review them thoroughly, until one has a good grasp of them. 2 Psalms 135:6 3 This refers to the aspect of Echad – One, which was explained above at length in chapters ten and eleven. 4 See Mikdash Melech on Zohar 16a. This is the aspect of Kadmon – Primordial (or Preceding) which was explained at length in chapters ten and eleven. 5 See chapters sixteen, seventeen and eighteen."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"etc . 6 [This desire then continu ed to descend ] until the aspec ts of the desire and pleasure with in Abba and Imma , and became limited within the [revealed] desire, intellect, and comprehension, which are the three upper sefirot of Chochmah and Binah etc. 7 [It then continued to descend ] until the aspect of the seven l ower sefirot of Binah . [Then it continued] until the aspect of the “immature brains – Katnoot HaMochin ” of NeHi”Y of Abba and Imma [as they vest ] within Zeir Anpin , as explained before . From there it underwent further restraint ( Tzimtzum ) on the three lev els of ChaBa”D and ChaGa”T of Zeir Anpin etc. , until the aspect of the externality of the vessels of Netzach and Hod [of Zeir Anpin ], which is the aspect of the “Breath of the Chest” . There , [the descent of] the light of the simple desire which was in clud ed in the concealed Essence of the Heyulie desire for kindness conclude s. 8 More over , this entire chaining down ( Hishtalshelut ), from the [essential] desire w hich arose hidden in the Essence ( He’elem HaAtzmoot ) until it came to be felt in the breath of t he heart, happens and is drawn down instantaneously, since “He and His life force and organs are one” . 9 T his means that, “He” literally refers to the aspect of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), whereas “His life force” refers to [bo th] the concealed and revealed aspect s of the ten sefirot , [which are] “l ike a flame [which is bound to the coal] etc” . 10 [This continues] until the aspect of the ten sefirot of Zeir Anpin . “ And His organs” refers to the aspect of the vessels of Zeir Anpin . “Are one ” means that all this is st ill in an aspect of Infinity ( Ein Sof ). This is because although the aspect of the vessels which limit the external emotions of the heart of Zeir Anpin are the ultimate “minuteness” compared to the exaltedness of the essential emotions of the aspect of Malchut of Ein Sof , they are , nevertheless , considered to be the aspect of the end of the beginning, as scripture states, “He calls out the generations from the beginning etc” 11 . Their final conclusion is the aspec t of th e “immature” [or “tiny ”] emotions of Zeir Anpin .   6 See chapters nineteen through twenty four. 7 See chapters twenty five and twenty six. (Also see chapters one through six. ) 8 Actually, this desire for kindness does not conclude on this level, which is the externality of the emotions of “the heart” of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , but really continues all the way to this physical world, where it comes into actual fruition. However , because at this point we have only explained the chaining down from the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmut Ohr Ein Sof ) to the externality of NeHi”Y of Zeir Anpin , this is where the chaining down, thus far, ends for us. 9 This is in accordance with wh at was explained in the previous chapter, that it is specifically because of the radiance of the essence of the soul within the heart, that a person becomes aroused either with love and attraction or fear and repulsion in his heart (which is called “ Re’oot a D’Leeba – The Desire of the Heart”). This is to say that there is an instantaneous unification and bond between the essence of one’s soul and the external arousal of the emotions of his heart, as if they are literally one. Likewise above, although ther e are a multitude of levels between the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) and the externality of the “heart” of Zeir Anpin (just as there are a multitude of levels between the essence of a person’s soul and his heart), nevertheless, they are so totally bound up and one with each other, that they are literally as a single entity. 10 See Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishnah 7. This was also explained previously at length in chapter nineteen. 11 Isaiah 41:4"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Because of this , Zeir Anpin is called “The Small F ace”, 12 [since ] it is similar to the small face of a small child compared to the “Large Face” 13 of “an elder who has acquired wisdom” . 14 The one is completely intellectually immatu re while the other is completely mature. None theless, they are equally in the c ategory of man, except that one is considered to be an “immature person ”, while the other is considered to be a “mature person ” . However, the form of how they are is the same. This is because the emotions of a child are also according to intellect and concealed desire etc, except that it becomes [revealed] with total immaturity . [However] in a mature adult, his emotions are mature, according to the brea dth of his intellect and his very lofty and exalted desire . 15 This is likewise the comparison between the immature emotions of Zeir Anpin , which are the emotions that are limited according to the immature intellect of Netzach and Hod , compared to the aspect of Arich Anpin which is called the “Large Face”. [This is to say that Arich Anpin represents ] the [mature] countenance and brains of “an elder who has acquired wisdom” from the source of the concealed wisdom [itself], which is hi gher than the “[Airy] Memb rane ( Krooma D’Avira )” . Thi s is the aspect of the hidden intellect ( Sechel HaNe’elam ) which is in the concealed desire ( Ratzon HaNe’elam ), which is the root of the Emanated etc. 16   12 The literal translation of “ Zeir Anp in ” is “The Small Face”. 13 See Tractate Chagigah 13b. 14 See Tractate Kiddushin 32b. 15 It must be pointed out, that though this analogy speaks of two separate people or entities, an adult and a child, this, of course, is not the case in relation to G -d, who is the analogue. In the analogue only one Being exists. Actually, this may also be understood as the great qualitative difference between when a single individual is in a state of “mature” intellectual thought, as opposed to when the very same individua l becomes emotional, in which case he is in a “state of immaturity”, similar to a child who acts only according to the arousal of his heartfelt emotions. In this example, we find that there may be times that the very same person may be “mature” and in a s uperior state of thought and intellect, while there may be other times when the very same individual may be in a “state of immaturity”, in which he is animated solely by his heartfelt emotions. Nonetheless, throughout, he is the very same individual, rega rdless of what state he is in. Moreover, even the “immature” state of heartfelt emotions follows the exact pattern of that which preceded it, in the emotions of the intellect, all the way to the emotions of the essence of his soul. 16 In other words, just a s there is no comparison between the state of the emotions as they exist during their arousal in the heart, compared to the state of the emotions as they exist in the essential power to conceptualize itself ( Koach HaMaskeel ), so too, there is a vast qualit ative difference between the emotions of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut compared to the emotions of Arich Anpin, which is the desire and root of the world of Atzilut -Emanation in its entirety. Nevertheless, the emotions of Zeir Anpin are literally patterned exactl y according to their arousal in Arich Anpin , since it is their source. If in a person’s desire he is aroused with kindness and compassion towards someone or something, the heartfelt emotions will likewise be aroused with kindness and compassion, in exactl y the same pattern and composition. There is no change in the pattern and composition between the heart and the desire, even to a hair’s breadth. Thus, although there is a vast qualitative difference between the two levels, nonetheless, they are literall y exactl y the same arousal in the perception of the person experiencing them. It is only that one is in the “superior” and “mature” state, which is the arousal of his desire, while the other is on a qualitatively “inferior” or more “immature” state, which is the arousal of his heartfelt emotions. However, they have exactly the same pattern and composition, and he remains the same individual. This is likewise the case above in regard to the qualitative difference between Arich Anpin – The Large Face (or Pe rsonage) who is like an “elder who has acquired wisdom” as opposed to Zeir Anpin – The Little Face (or Personage) which is compared to a small child who completely follows his heartfelt emotions. However, as the Rebbe will point out momentarily, this, lik ewise, is the difference between Arich Anpin -the Large Face (or Personage) as compared to the higher level of Adam Kadmon - Primordial Man (which is also called “ Adam D’Briyah – Man of Creation”)."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"In the same way , even the aspect of the emotions of the concealed desire an d intellect of Arich Anpin are in the aspect of immaturity compared to the aspect of the even greater “man”, i.e. the aspect of Adam Kadmon , who is called “The Man of Creation”. 17 (As is known, Zeir Anpin is called “The Man of Action”, Arich Anpin is calle d “The Man of Formation” and Adam Kadmon is called “The Man of Creation”. 18 In each of these there are ten sefirot in a concealed and revealed [manner], as it scripture states, 19 [ “For My glory , I have created, formed, and even actualized”]. “For My glory” refers to Malchut of the Infinite ( Ein Sof ), “I have created” refers to Adam Kadmon , “formed” refers to Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin , and “actualized” refers to the aspect of Zeir Anpin , about whom it states, 20 “Let us make man in our image [and in our liken ess ]”. 21 )   17 In other words, there is a vast qualitative difference bet ween one’s general self perception and a specific desire which becomes revealed from the general desire and self perception. The one is a desire which literally includes the whole of his life in a “single glance”, as explained before, while the other is m erely a revelation of a particular desire which comes out of this self -perception. Nevertheless, the particular desire which is revealed can only be according to the general self -perception and desire within himself. There cannot be any divergence from th e general desire to the particular desire, whatsoever. This is why the particular desires that a person has, act as an indicator and reveal how he perceives himself etc, as explained before at length. This is, likewise, the difference between Adam Kadmon – Primordial Man (who is also called Adam D’Briyah – The Man of Creation) compared to the aspect of Arich Anpin – The Large Face (who is also called Adam D’Yetzirah – The Man of Formation). Adam Kadmon is compared to a general self -perception and desire which includes the entirety of the chaining down of the worlds in a “single glance”, just as the self -perception of a person includes the whole of his life span in a single glance. In contrast, Arich Anpin is comparable to a specific desire which emerges and becomes revealed out of the general desire of Adam Kadmon . Hence, there is a vast difference in quality between the two. Nonetheless, the desire and pleasure of Arich Anpin (and Atik Yomin ) are literally according to the general desire of Adam Kadmon , which is the source, and are perfectly patterned after it. This is similar to the fact that one’s specific desires will always be patterned in accordance with his self -perception and self -image. It is for this reason that Arich Anpin is called the “rev elation of the concealed”, since this particular desire ( Arich ) is a revelation of the concealed desire ( Adam Kadmon ) , just as a person’s particular desires reveal his self -perception and self -image which is his concealed desire. 18 It was explained in chap ter eighteen that the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) is a system which repeats itself, both in general and in particular. For example, the ten sefirot of every world also subdivide into ten sefirot, which further subdivide into ten sefi rot, ad infinitum. This creates infinite worlds and realms, each different from the other, in that it is either more particular or more general. Likewise, the chaining down of the worlds repeats itself, so that there are general worlds and particular wor lds, which, although are different, possess similarities and likenesses to the qualities they correspond to. In the “General Worlds - Olamot D’Klalloot ”, there is also a scheme of four worlds; Atzilut - Emanation , Briyah - Creation , Yetzirah - Formation and Asiya h -Actualization. The Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) which radiates within the Kav - Line and Ratzon HaKadoom - the Primal Desire (which, as explained previously, is a “duplicate” of the Ratzon HaPashoot HaMoochlat BaAtzmoot - “The Simple Det ermined Desire of the Essence”) is compared to the world of Atzilut -Emanation, which is not yet considered to be a creation of “something from nothing”, but is, rather, an emanation of the Essential Light of G -d. In contrast, Adam Kadmon - Primordial Man is considered to be the general world of Briyah - Creation, and is thus called “Man of Creation – Adam D’Briyah ”. This is because the existence of Adam Kadmon comes about as a creation of something out of nothing, as explained before at length. Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin which are the two aspects of Keter of Atzilut are called “Man of Formation - Adam D’Yetzirah ”, and Zeir Anpin of Atzilut is called “Man of Actualization - Adam D’Asiyah ”. 19 Isaiah 43:7 20 Genesis 1:26 21 In other words, although there is a vast di fference in quality between the emotions of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut and the emotions of Malchut of the Infinite ( Ein Sof ), nevertheless, the emotions of the “heart” of Zeir Anpin are literally patterned according to the emotions of Malchut of the Infinite, a s it states, “In our form and in our image etc”."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" This is analogous to the formation of lines which are made small [representing] something [much] bigger, such as how a map is patterned after planet earth. Nonetheless, this image contains everything in it. N othing is missing, not even the amoun t of “the thorn of the letter Yod ” , 22 except that it is a very tiny [scale m odel] in which the form of a tiny line may be a five hundred Parsa long river on planet earth, and the like. Likewise, b y way of analogy, are the immature emotions of an infant , co mpared to t he emotions of an elder of seventy years . This is similar to the ability [of an adult] to give birth to [offspring] who have a similar ity to him etc. (This accords with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of Bootzin Bootzin [ Mikee tphay Yediya ] – “ Small pumpkins [are discernable when they burst forth from their sap] etc ” . 23 ) This is similarly the case in regard to the aspect of the emotions of the “Man” of [the world of] Atzilut . Even though they become [revealed] in a most dimini shed fashion ( Tzimtzum ) in comparison to the aspect of the emotions of Adam Kadmon and Arich Anpin , none theless , it is all one, except that it comes from the aspect o f a most incredible length to a most incredible brevity. 24 (This is the meaning of [the verse , 25 ] “What is his name, what is his son’s name – Mah Shmo, Mah Shem Bno ”. “What is his name – Mah Shmo ” [refers to the aspect of] Ma”H of Adam Kadmon , and “What is his son’s name – Mah Shem Bno ” is the aspect of Zeir Anpin , 26 as explained in several plac es.) This, then, is the general Hitbonenut -contemplation [ of the verse, “Whatever HaShem desires He has done, in the heavens and the earth etc”]. “Whatever HaShem desire s ” in the Essence of the Infinite Light, literally, “He has done in the heavens - Shama yim ”, which is the aspect of Zeir Anpin . 27 [T he word “ Shamayim – Heavens” is a conglomeration of the two words ] “ Aish   22 This is to say that literally everything exists in the “scale model”. In this sense it is different from a regular map which does not actually possess any actual qualities of that which it depicts. Rathe r, this is just a smaller version which actually possesses everything which is in the larger version, but in smaller form. Likewise, Zeir Anpin of Atzilut also has ten sefirot (desire, intellect, heartfelt emotions, gut emotions, thought, speech and actio n) but in a qualitatively much “smaller” and lesser form. 23 See Tractate Brachot 48a. The Talmud relates that as young children, Abaye and Rava were sitting before Rabbah and he asked them, “To Whom do we recite the blessing?” They answered, “To the Merc iful One.” He retorted, “And where does the Merciful One dwell? Rava pointed upward to the ceiling. Abaye went outside and pointed up toward the sky. Rabbah said to them, “Both of you will grow up to be Rabbis”. The Talmud comments: This is an example of what people say, “Small pumpkins are discernable when they burst forth from their sap”. The relevance of this analogy to our chapter is clearly understood, that even though Zeir Anpin is “small” and “immature” relative to that which is above it, never theless, it is the very same matter. That is, the emotions of the “heart” of Zeir Anpin are the very same emotions as Arich Anpin and Adam Kadmon etc, from which it receives. (See also Siddur (of the Alter Rebbe ), Erev Shabbat , 164d, and Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim p.207.) 24 This has already been explained in footnotes nine, f ifteen , sixteen , and seventeen of this chapter and in the previous chapter at length (with the analogy of how a person’s essential desire radiates even in the external ar ousal of the desires and emotions of his heart – Re’oota D’Leeba ). 25 Proverbs 30:4 26 It was explained before that the name of 45 – Ma”H ( מ \" ה ) corresponds to the six emotional sefirot . Thus, the words “ Mah Shmo – What is His name” can be read “ Ma”H is His name” and the words “What is His sons name – Mah Shem Bno ” can be read “ Ma”H is His sons name”. In other words, the emotions of Zeir Anp in of Atzilut are patterned and composed literally exactly according to the emotions of Adam Kadmon and above. 27 See Zohar Beshalach 62b, and Idra Zuta , Ha’azinu 288a."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"– Fire” and “ Mayim – Water”, 28 [that is,] Chessed -Kindness and Gevurah -Judgment of the immaturity of [the world of] Atzilut .

See Tractate Chagiga 12a, and Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 11 and 12, and the commentaries there. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Vayikra , Vol.2, Page 498, and Dvarim Vol.4, Page 1,392 ( א ' שצב ). 29 That is, in truth, even the emotions of Zeir Anpin of the world of Asiyah – Actualization are literally patterned according to the desire of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), as will later be explained. 30 See Sefer Yetzirah , Chapter 1, Mishnah 6 – “Their end is bound with their beginning and their beginning with their end”. This is to say that the emotions at the end of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut are on e with the emotions at the beginning of the chaining down, which are the emotions of Adam Kadmon (and above). 31 The same is true of all the other sefirot as well, and not only Chochmah – Wisdom. 32 See Samuel I, 25:32, and Kings I, 1:48, 8:15. (“ Baruch Hava yah Elokei Yisrael ”) 33 Deuteronomy 6:4 34 It appears to me that in this parenthesis the Rebbe brings out the point that just as the emotions of Zeir Anpin are the same emotions as the emotions of Arich Anpin and Adam Kadmon , and that they are totally and co mpletely bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), and this matter was then applied to Chochmah as well, that the “tiny” Chochmah of Zeir Anpin is totally and completely bound up with the Chochmah of Adam Kadmon and above etc, so also, the same is true of the aspect of Yisrael Saba (which represents the emotions of Chochmah, as explained before). As mentioned in chapter twenty six, there is an aspect of Yisrael Saba (the emotions of Chochmah ) in the aspect of Abba of Atzilut , a nd there is also a higher Yisrael Saba in the aspect of Arich Anpin . Likewise, there is an even higher aspect of Yisrael Saba in Adam Kadmon , and as will be explained later, there is a lower Yisrael which is called “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Yisrael”. T he point of this parenthesis is that although there is no comparison between the aspect of Yisrael Saba (the emotions of Chochmah ) of Adam Kadmon and the aspect of “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Yisrael” of Zeir Anpin , nevertheless, the “Little Yisrael” (the emotions of Chochmah of Zeir Anpin ) is literally the same as the emotions of Yisrael Saba (the emotions of Chochmah ) of Adam Kadmon, with no divergence from it whatsoever, even to the minutest amount of “the thorn of the letter Yod ”. In other words, even the lowest aspect of “ Yisrael ” is literally patterned according to the essential desire of G -d and how He estimated within Himself (in the emotions of Chochmah of Malchut of the Infinite – Ein Sof ). This is in accordance with what was explained in this ch apter in regard to the comparison between the heartfelt emotions of Zeir Anpin and the emotions of Arich Anpin and Adam Kadmon .

However, in the particular explanat ion of the chaining down of the worlds ( Hishtalshelut D’Pratoot ), it means “Whatever HaShem desires” in the emotions of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , “He has done in the heavens and the earth” of the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah , all the way until this p hysical world. This is to say that even the most final Tzimtzum in the actualization of our physical world and everything therein, is totally one with and bound to the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) which preceded the Tzimtzum . (This is similar to how a person’s most limited and particular actions are totally bound with the very essence of his soul). This will all be explained in later chapters, with the help of G -d."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"SHA’AR HAYICHUD The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Introduction to Chapter T hirty -four By Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Part One In the following chapter the Rebbe begins to explain the aspect of the emotions of the worl d of Atzilut – Emanation, which are called Zeir Anpin . He begins by stating that there a re two general states and levels of Zeir Anpin (the emotions) . These two states are called Yaakov and Yisrael . T o fully understand the explanation s of the chapter in regard to the se two general states and the differenc e between them (including all the ir particular s), the following introduct ion should be read . Withi n the aspect of th e heart there are emotions, such as the aspect s of love or hate etc. For instance , wh en a person sees something he loves, which his soul is attached to , his heart will be drawn after it . Wh en he sees something he ha tes, his heart is moved to despise and distance himself from it . These are the aspects of the right and left lines of the hea rt ( Chessed and Gevurah ). All subsequent emotions are particular “branches” of the se two primary emotions. Now, the emotions of the heart are drawn from the emotions of the intellect. This is because in the intellect there also is an aspect of emotion s, except that as they exist there they are not actual emotions of love and fear alto gether. Rather, they are intellect, such as an intellect which necessitates love for something or an intellect which necessitates hate for something. I t is , therefore, p ossible for the emotions to exist intellect ually, even though what he loves or hates is not present. Rather, his intellect necessitates that if this thing would be present, it would be fitting to either love it or hate it, etc. In contrast, the emotions o f the heart do not arise except if what he lo ves or hates is present. Only then do the actual heartfelt emotion s of love or hate come into play and be come revealed in the heart. As explained above, with in the intellect are the two aspects of Chochmah and Binah . There are emotions in the aspect of Binah , which are emotions of comprehension, and there are emotions which are higher than the comprehension and reasoning of Binah , as they exist in the aspect of Chochmah . This is the aspect of how the essenc e of a person’s intellect , which is higher than reasoning , necessitates and compels him to lean either towards Chessed or Gevurah , to love or to hate something etc. (A s explained in chapter twenty -six , the emotions of Chochmah are the emotional leanings o f the intellect towards either kindnes s or severity before spread ing forth into the comprehension and re asoning. That is, as of yet, he cannot explain why this is his leaning and opinion, however, this is h ow he sees things. This is similar to the Talmud ic incident in which, “Rav was silent” and did not respond to the difficulties pos ed against his position, even though he did not submit to the opposing view"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"etc. In contrast, t he emotions of Binah are the tan gible explanations and reasons of why this is h is position.) Now, as known , “ Chochmah is found from nothing”. This “nothing” is the aspect of the potential power to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ) which is higher than Chochmah itself and is the hidden potential po wer and source of intellectualizatio n and conceptualiz ation . It is from this power and source that all the various particular flashes of insig ht and intellect become revealed. T his intellectual flash of insight comes forth into a state of revelat ion from its concealed source in a manner of a “skip – Dilug ” from “nothing” to “something”. (H ow ever , although the revelation of kindness in the heart also comes from its concealed source, neverthel ess, this does not occur in the manner of a “skip – Dilug ” , but rather, it comes from being concea led (in the mind) to being reve aled (in the heart ). Therefore, it is only considered to be a progression or chaining down of “something from something” ( Yesh M’Yesh ). In contrast, Chochmah occurs in the way of a “skip – Dilug ” from “nothing to something” ( Yesh M’Ain ). This is evidenced from the fact that the revelation of kindness i n the heart does not require toil. Rather, all that is required is the arousal of desire. As soon as a person’s desire to do goodness or kindness is aroused, the kindness imm ediat ely becomes revealed in his heart. Such is not the case in regard to intellect. Even when a person’s desire is aroused to conc eptualize and “be wise”, it does no t become reve aled except through great toil and effort . This indicates that the source and root of Chochmah is in a sta te of “nothingness – Ein ” and may, therefore , be revealed only through great toil and effort .) This potential power to conceptualize ( Koach HaMaskeel ), is called “the hidden wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah , since it is the sour ce of the in tellect, and is itself hidden and above actual thought, but is rathe r included in the essence of the desire ( Arich Anpin ), as previously explained. Now, just as there are emotions in Chochmah and Binah , as mentioned above, so is there also an aspect of emotions in this source of Chochmah , a s it is included as a “nothing” in the essence of the desire ( Arich Anpin ). These are the emotions of the aspect of the “hidden wisdom” - Chochmah Stima’ah . ( Likewise, in the same manner , there are even high er emotions than the aspect of the “hidden Chochmah ” , as they exist in the very essence of the desire itself ( Keter of Arich Anpin ), and even higher, as they exist in the essential pleasure ( Atik Yomin ), an d even higher, all the way to their original sourc e with in the very essence of the soul itself , which is even higher than pleasure and desire, as previously explained.) In light of the above, w e may now understand that there are two aspects, Yisrael Saba – The Elder Israel and Yisrael Zoota – The Littl e Israel: The aspect of Yisrael Saba – The Elder Israel , is the aspect of the emotions of Chochmah and Binah and the emotions of the “hidden intellect – Chochmah Stima’ah ”. This is because the word “ Saba ” is the Aramaic for the Hebrew word “ Zaken – Eld er”, as in the verse “ Zaken Shekana Chochmah – An elder who has acquired wisdom” from the actual source of wisdom itself. The matter of “acquisition ( Kinyan )” means that it is drawn down (from one domain to another) without any actual transformation in it s state of being at all. For example, when someone acquires or purchases something there is no essential change in the thing itself. Rather, the only change is that it is transferred from one domain to the other. It originally was in the domain of the se ller and now is transferred to the domain of the buyer etc. "},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"In the same manner , as the emotions are included in the intellect of Chochmah and Binah , the intellect radiates within them without any co ncealment or change of being at all. This is likewise true of the emotions of “the hidden wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ” wherein they are totally include d and one with the source of intellect , which radiates within them . They have no separate existence from it at all . It is because of this that the emotions of the intellect, including the emotions of the “ source of intellect ” are called, “The Elder Israel – Yisrael Saba ”. This, then, is the meaning of the verse, 1 “What ( Ma”H ) is his name and what ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name”. (As previously explained, the aspec t of Ma”H refers to the six emotional sefirot .) The first part of the verse, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name”, refers to the aspect of the emotions as they exist in the “hidden wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ”. The second part of the verse, “What ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name”, refers to the aspect of the emotions which are “ born ” in the brain, as they exist in the aspects of Chochmah and Binah . That is, they are “born” or become reve aled from the “ hidden wisdom - Mocha Stima’ah , which is the source of Chochmah itself. However, t he aspect of Yisrael Zoota – The Little Israel , is the aspect of the emotions that are drawn into the heart which is below Chochmah . (That is, the term “ An elder who has acquired wisdom” is not applicable to actual heartfelt emotions , since they only receive a glimmer of a glimmer of the emotions of the in tellect, and do indeed undergo a change of their state of being .) They are called “Little Israel – Yisrael Zoota ” becau se they are in a state of immaturity . This is because they only become rev ealed through the concealment of the main e ssence of the intellect. As stated , they only rec eive a glimmer of a glimmer of th e essence of the intellect as it is drawn forth in to the heart to vest within the heartfelt emotions of Chessed and Gevurah . This glimmer of a glimmer is called , “T he intellect of the emotions”, and is only drawn from the aspect of the external vessels of NeHi”Y of Chochmah and Binah, whereas the essential light of intellect itself becomes withdrawn and conceale d. For example, th is is similar to the seminal drop which is drawn from the brain of the father ( Abba ), which comes only from the externality of the vessels. Moreover, the seminal drop is only fr om the most external vessels, since it is derived from the spiritual int ellect as it is already vested within the physical brain. This is in contrast to the above revelations of intellect which are more spiritual and do not actually vest with in the physicality of the brain. Nevertheless, there is a benefit in the seminal drop of t he father in that the very essence of his soul is vested in it ( since it results from the pleasure ( Atik ) which draws out the essential self). I t is for this reason that this give s birth to a child who resembles his father. With the above in mind, we ca n now understand a second meaning of the verse, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name, and what ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name.” That is, both the aspects of the intellect of Chochmah and Binah and the aspect of “the hidden wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ” are included in the fi rst part of the verse, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name”. T he second part of the verse, “What ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name” refers to the aspect of the heartfelt emotions , which come about in a manner of “ birth ” from the seminal drop (as will be explained), specifica lly after the main essence of the intellect has become withdrawn and concealed and only a glimmer of the intellect radiates within them. This is called an “offspring light – Ohr   1 Proverbs 30:4"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Shel Toldah ”. (That is, it is no longer the essential light of the intellect itself, but is rather only an “offspring light” which is “ born ” of it.) More particularly, this may be further understoo d as follows: I n various places it is explained that the letter Aleph ( א ) represents the sefirah of Chochmah , as in the verse, 2 “ A’Al ephcha Chochmah – I sha ll teach you wisdom”. ( Chochmah is called a teacher since it is the aspect of the influencer relative to the aspect of Binah , which is the recipient of the wisdom etc.) Now, as may be observed , the form and image of the letter Aleph ( א ) has a Yod ( י ) at its top, a Yod ( י ) at its the bottom, and the line of a Vav ( ו ) in its middle. Now, the point of the Yod ( י ) which is above , is the aspect of Chochmah of Chochmah 3 which receives from the light of Keter (i.e. from the aspect of “the hidden wisdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ” of Keter , i.e. Arich Anpin ). This is as stated, “ Chochmah is found from nothing”. This level is called “ Pele – Wondrous” or “ Pla’ot Chochmah – The Wonders o f Chochmah ”. (The word “ Pele – Wondrous” ( פלא ) is the reverse letters of “ Aleph - Teach” ( אלף ). This, then, is the aspect of the “brain” of the “father – Abba ” . ) This is because the aspect of Chochmah of Chochmah is the most supernal aspect of Chochmah , and is like the aspect of Atzilut of Choch mah itself. It is for this reason that it is called “ Pele – Wondrous” ( פלא ). In contrast, t he lower Yod ( י ) is the aspect of Yesod of Abba ( Chochmah ) which influences below to Binah in an aspect of an intangible point of insight which becomes revealed in the depth of the comprehension ( Omek HaMoosag ) of Binah . (The letter Beit ( ב ) represents the aspect of Binah , as is explained regarding the letter Beit ( בית ) which is the first letter of the first word of the Torah, “ Bereshit – In the Beginning” ( בּראש ית ). The point in the center of the letter Beit ) בּ ( of the word “ Bereshit – In the Beginning” ( בּראשית ) represents the point of Chochmah which flashes into Binah . This is because the letter Beit ( בית ), when spelled out , is the same as the word “ Bayit – House” ( בַּיִת ). As was previously mentioned, this union of the point of the insight of Chochmah within the comprehension of Binah is known as, “the point [of Chochmah ] within the palace [of Binah ] – Nekudah BeHechalah ”. This is also in accordance with t he verse, 4 “A house ( Bayit ) is built with wisdom ( Chochmah ) .”) Now, the line which is in the middle of the letter Aleph ( א ) rep resents the “six directions” (the emotions) of Chochmah , for it is similar to the letter Vav ( ו ) which has the numerical value of six. Th us, we find that, as a whole, the form of the letter Aleph ( א ) represents Chochmah ( Abba ). The Yod ( י ) on top is the aspect of Chochmah of Chochmah (i.e. the “brain” of the “father – Abba ”), the Vav ( ו ) in the middle is the aspect of the “six directions” (The emotions of Chochmah ), and the Yod ( י ) at the bottom is the aspect of the point of Yesod of Abba – Father ( Chochmah ) which influences down into Imma – Mother ( Binah ). From the above it is understood that in Chochmah itself there a re two a spects. This is to say that there is Chochmah of Chochmah , which is the essential light of Chochmah itself. This is the   2 Job 33:33 3 It is explained in various places that the upper point of the Ale ph includes all three upper sefirot of Chochmah , which are Keter, Chochmah and Binah of Chochmah . (See Biurei Zohar of the Tzemach Tzedek , Parshat Balak - chapter 10 (p.532).) 4 Proverbs 24:3"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"aspect of the upper Yud ( י ) of the letter Aleph ) א ( , which refers to Chochmah of Abba as it receives from the aspect of “the hidden wi sdom – Chochmah Stima’ah ” of Arich Anpin . In regard to this it states, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name and what ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name”. More particularly, however, when this Chochmah of Chochmah itself comes to influence down to Binah , there issues forth a s eminal drop or seminal flash of insight which comes to be revealed only through the constraints and measurement of the line of the Vav ( ו ) of the Aleph ( א ). This is the aspect of the seminal point of the lower Yud ( י ) of the letter Aleph ( א ), which represents the aspect of Yesod of Abba – Father (i.e. Chochmah ). We may now understand the particular explanation and meaning of the statem ent of the Rebbe in the following chapter that: “The emotions which are below Chochmah [intellect] are called “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Israel”, for they are in an aspect of immaturity.” This refers to the aspect of how the emotions are included and con cealed within the seminal drop and flash of insight which is below the main essence of the intellect of Chochmah of Chochmah and is only the aspect of the seminal flash of Yesod of Abba which spreads forth into Binah . “[This is] because of the fact that t hey come [to be revealed] with the concealment and withdrawal of the main essence of the intellect.” This is to say that the main essence of the intellect of Abba, which is the aspect of Chochmah of Chochmah, becomes withdrawn and concealed. “[All that is revealed] is what the external vessels of Netzach and Hod of Abba draw forth in order to give rise to and [for example] bring out an intellect for kindness ( Chessed ) and love, which is called “ Chessed Zoota – The Little Kindness”.” As previously expla ined, Netzach and Hod are the aspects of “the kidneys that give council” and determine exactly what to reveal and bring down to the recipient through the aspect of Yesod which mediates between the two and receives the limited influence etc. (Allegorically , this is compared to the aspect of the two testicles of the father.) Thus, we find that the actual essence of Chochmah of Abba is withdrawn and concealed, and only a limited and restrained influence of the seminal drop and flash of insight is sent forth into Imma – Mother ( Binah of Atzilut ). (We have underlined the word “intelle ct” to emphasize that although we are speaking of the source of the emotions of Zeir Anpin , nevertheless, this flash of insight from Yesod of Abba ( Chochmah ) into Imma ( Binah ) is still pure intellect and not yet emotions at all. Moreover, this seminal flash of insight is still considered to be an aspect of the “nothing ( Ein )” of Chochmah, relative to the “something ( Yesh )” of Binah , and is still the intangible depth of the compreh ension. (For example, the emotions as they exist in this seminal drop of Chochmah do not yet have a tangible explanation and reasoning, as exp lained previously regarding the matter of “Rav was silent”.) Nonetheless, the birth and growth of the heartfelt emotions is compared to the conception, birth and developmental growth of a child, and just as the main essence of the child comes from the seminal drop of the father, so too , the main essence of the emotions is from this seminal flash of insight and perce ption , as will soon be explained at greater length.) “(Allegorically, this is like the seminal drop which is in the brain of the father etc. Similarly, it states “What ( Ma”H ) is his son ’s name” in reference to “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Israel” which is drawn from the seminal drop of Abba (The Father) [i.e. Chochmah ] etc, as is known.)” This is to say that there is a vast difference between how the seminal drop is , as it still is totally included in Chochmah of Chochmah which is “the brain -"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Moach ” of “the father – Abba ”, in contrast to how the seminal drop spreads forth from Yesod of Abba ( Chochmah ) to ultimately become the source of actual heartfelt emotions. Thus, more particularly speaking, regarding these two aspects of the essential light of Abb a (which is Chochmah of Chochmah ) and the aspect of the point of the flash of insight ( Yesod of Chochmah ) which is the seminal drop which is “the son” ( Zeir Anpin ) it states, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name, and what ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name”. Part Two The e xpl anation of all of the above, in addition to how the emotions are included in the seminal drop and flash of insight of Chochmah which then develop in Binah , may further be understood as follows: It was previously explained that Chochmah is the aspect of intangible “nothingness” while Binah is the aspect of tangibility and “ something - ness”. This is because the influence of Chochmah is drawn forth like a flash of lightening from above to below, and is only the aspect of a point. Afterwards, in Binah this point spreads out into a length and breadth, which is the length and brea dth of the contemplation and comprehension, as was previously explained using the analog y of the length and width of a river (on the verse, “ A river came out of Eden ” etc.) For this reason, the Yesod of Abba - Father ( Chochmah ) is an aspect of spreading forth from above to below, for it is the aspect of the flash of the point of insight which spreads forth from influencer ( Chochmah ) to recipient ( Binah ). Binah is the aspect of the r ecipient of this influence, and is therefore called Imma – Mother. Now, as explained in chapter twenty -six, the heartfelt emotions are born spec ifically out of a unification of Abba – Father ( Chochmah ) and Imma – Mother ( Binah ), i.e. when the influence of the light of Chochmah is drawn forth into the vessel of Yesod of Binah . As mentioned in chapter thirty, this is analogous to the seminal drop, which certainly includes the entire form within itself, including all the particular limbs of the child which w ill be developed etc. This is similar to the fact that if one examines a lima bean, he will find an entire tiny lima plant folded within it . However, in the seminal drop, all of the limbs , literally from head to toe , are included there , but in a more spi ritual and refi ned manner. At this point, if observed under a microscope, one will not see anything remotely resembling a tiny man . Nonetheless, everyth ing is there in a very hidden fashion , encoded into the DNA etc. This means that the seminal drop only contains the spiritual potentiality for ea ch limb which will develop in the mother’s womb etc. Moreover, the spiritual “organs” are so totally concealed there to the extent that we are not aware of their existence altogether. However, during the nine m onths of pregnancy, once the fetus begins to form in the mother’s womb , it progressively takes on more and more recognizable characteristics, though it is still concealed in the womb. More over, although its state of existence is more recognizable than its state as a seminal drop , nonetheless, it still is concealed and totally dependant on its mother. This is because a fetus only consumes whatever its mother consumes, as known. Even so, the extent of the concealment at this stage is not at all comparable t o the extent of concealment and c omplete inclusion when it was a seminal drop, in which the organs only exist ed as spiritual potentialities and were completely hidden . "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"According to this analogy we may understand the birth of the emotions from the aspect o f Yesod of Abba which was mentioned above. In the seminal drop of Chochmah the emotions are in an aspect of great concealment, and their existence is not noticeable whatso ever. This is not the case in regard to Binah , in which the existence of the em otio ns is felt to a much greater degree , al though , even as they are in Binah they still are concealed , like a fe tus in its mother’s womb . A s is clearly obse rvable, there is an arousal of love and fear even in the brain of Binah . This arousal is called “intel lectual love and fear”, as is known. 5 Although it is only an arous al of intellect alone, nevertheless, ther e is an aspect of emotions, such as the emotio ns of love etc. However, it is totally included and one with the intellect itself, and is not felt to be an aspect of a “something” in and of itself. This is not the case , however, after the emotion is born “out of the womb” of Imma – the Mother ( Binah ). Here, there is the birth of he artfelt emotions which come out complete ly reve aled as totally felt emotions and indeed have an existence of their own, (as if they are) completely separate from th e power of the intellect. None thel ess, even as the emotions are aroused as they are included in the intellect (of Binah ) they are recognizable and felt as an existence of the aspect of emotions, and are , literally , according to how they will be afterwards , when they become reve aled in the heart from their former state of concealment. However, as they are in Binah they still are concealed within the intellect. This is , literally , like the analogy of a fetus which is in its mother ’s womb. There, it does indeed have a recognizable and felt existence of its own, but is , nonetheless, concealed and included in the womb and is nourished sole ly by what the mother con sumes etc. (Likewise, the nine months of pregnancy correspond to the nine sefirot of the emotions of Zeir Anpin .) In contrast, the aspect of the emotions which are included in the aspect of Chochmah , which transcends comprehension , do not possess a recog nizable or fe lt existence as an emotion or arousal whatsoever , as of yet. Of course, they most certain ly and necessarily have an existence, even as they are in Chochmah , nonetheless, they are spirit ual and refined without any noticeable existence whatsoev er. This is , literally , comparable to the fetus as it is concealed and included when it still is only a seminal drop etc. (As previously mentioned , the first letter Heh ( ה ) of the tetragrammaton (the four letter name of G-d, Havayah ) refers to the aspect of Binah . Now, the letter Heh ( ה ) has a small leg which is in the form of a tiny Vav ( ו ). The main body of the Heh ( ה ) is in the form of the letter Dalet ( ד ), which repr esents the aspect of spreading forth to a length and brea dth. This is the aspect of the length and brea dth of the comprehension of Binah itself. The small leg of the Heh ( ה ), which is in the form of a Vav ( ו ) (which has a numerical value of six) represen ts the aspect of the six emotions (of Zeir Anpin ) as they are included within the “womb” of Imma ( Binah ). However, a t this stage of the emotions, they are only a “tiny Vav ” , representing the smallness and imma turity of the emotions. This is because as lo ng as the emotions are concealed with in Binah they are only like a fetus which is “folded over three within three, with its head between his knees” (i.e. in the “fetal position”). This is in contrast to how the emotions are included in the aspect of Choch mah . As previously explained, Chochmah corresponds to the letter Yud ( י ) of the four letter name of G -d. The   5 See Kuntres HaHitpa’alut (A Tract on Divine Ecstasy) and Par t 3 of “The Knowledge of G - d” ."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"letter Yud ( י ) is like a point. The six emotions (and the aspect of Malchut ) are included in the Yud ( י ) of Chochmah in a manner of total concealme nt. They are not observable in the Yud ( י ) itself, but are only implied. That is, when one spells out the implied letters of Yud ( י ) it is spelled Yud -Vav -Dalet ( יו \" ד ). The letter Vav ( ו ) has a numerical value of six and corresponds to the aspect of the si x emotional qualities of Zeir Anpin . (As will be explained later on in the book, the letter Dalet ( ד ) corresponds to the aspect of Malchut , which is called “ Dal – Poor ” ( דל ), as she has nothing of her own but only what she rec eives from the other Sefirot .) Thus, these aspects are included in Chochmah in a manner of total concealment. 6 ) From all of the above we may now understand why it is that when the emotions of Zeir Anpin are still included in the aspect of Abba ( Chochmah ) it is considered to be a true “Inclusion – Hitkaleloot ”. In contrast, when they descend as a seminal flash to become developed in Imma ( Binah ) they are considered to be in a state of gestation , like a fetus in the womb of its mother, and are called an “ Uba r – Fetus”. This is the firs t state of the emotions, as they are still with in the intellectual statures of Abba and Imma , before they are “born” as a “something” in and of themselves. 7 Part Three Let us now continue to expla in the upcoming concepts of the chapter. The Rebbe stat es, Now, from the aspect of NeHi”Y of Abba there is drawn forth into NeHi”Y of Imma , which is the aspect of the influencing and lowering of the comprehension and reasoning of this emotion of kindness. From all of the ab ove, this statement is s elf underst ood. This is to say that as the emotions are included in Chochmah they do not yet have the existence of a “ something ” , in a way of explanation and reasoning, as in the above example of “Rav was silent”. Rather, they are only the intellectual emotional le anings which come from the perception o f the power to conceptualize itself, and really even higher, in the pleasure of the soul. It is only afterwards, when this leaning of the perception of Chochmah becomes invested within the comprehension of Binah , tha t these leanings are given an actual existence with tangible comprehension and reasoning. The Reb be then states: However, the aspect of NeHi”Y of Imma is withdrawn during the birthing and revelation of the arousal of the attribute of love and the like, [ of the heartfelt emotions]. The explanation of this may be understood as follows. From the analogy of a fetus in its mother’s womb it is understood that it already has a recognizable existence of its own, and is not totally one with the mother’s existence , as it was with the father , before impregnation. That is, the mother is the “ca rrier” and “host” of the fetus , but its existence is not really her existence, as it was before it was emitted from the father.   6 See Biurei Zohar of the Tzemach Tzedek, Vol.2, Balak pg.1001 7 See chapter thirty -four of Likutei Biurim from R’ Hillel of Paritch.

See also Etz Chaim, Shaar 20, Chapter 3, (and Shaar 17, Chapter 2."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"However, since it is concealed in her womb and has not been born yet, it cannot be readily differentiated from her. Moreover, although it has its own existence , nonetheless, it is still completely dependant on the mother and “consumes only what she consumes”. Throughout the nin e months of pregnancy it progressively develops until, when it is complete , it is prepared to come out. A t this point there are two reasons why the infant comes out of the womb and is born . Firstly, the infant itself desir es to come out. Secondly, the mother no longer can co ntain and carry the child, for it has grown beyond her capacity. Hence, her body expels the baby and it becomes a completely independent individual, who exists in and of him self. In the same fashion above , as the emotions are included in Imma (i.e. Binah ), the brain of Binah is like the “carrier” or “host” for the seminal flash and perception of Chochmah . Nevertheless, the brain of Binah develops it in to a tangib le concept that may be grasped and comprehended . Because of this, as the initial concept is caused to grow, so are the emotions and their arousal within the intellect caused to grow. An example of this is that when a person contemplates something depressing, his mind itself will become saddened (until afterwards , his heartfe lt emotions will like wise respond with heartfelt feelings of depression ). Similarly, when he contemplates and dwells upon so mething joyful in his mind, his mind itself become s ar oused with joy (until he become s aroused with joy in the heartfelt emotions of the heart). This i s because it is the comprehending brain of Binah which has the power to take the seminal point of the concept and deve lop it into tangible comprehension . However, as is clearly observable, the more that one thinks about something in his brain of Binah , th e more the matter expand s and grow s, and the emotional arousal of his thoughts and intellect likewise bec ome expanded, until his mind no longer can co ntain the great arousal taking plac e in it. At this point the “infant”, i.e. the emotional a rousal of t he intellect has de veloped to the point that it no longer can be contained within t he brain of the comprehension ( since the emotions themselves are really not a matter of the compr ehension alt ogether , but actually are of a higher order than comprehension. The comprehension merely causes them to grow, as exp lained above. T he comprehension merely develops the seminal emotions of love and fear etc.) Therefore, at this point the inte llect withdraws and expels the expanded emotions which it can contain no long er. Part Four For, as is clearly observable, the reasoning and the intellect becomes shortened and withdrawn when there is an arousal of the [heartfelt] emotions. The rea son intellect and reasoning withdraw in order for the emotions to be born may be understood through the following explanation of the matter of “You shall see on the birthing stones” that the thighs become cold durin g the time of [labor] and birth: "},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Torah relates how Pharaoh comman ded the midwives to kill all Jewish male new born s. The verse states, 8 “And he said, when you are assisting the Hebrew women at childbirth... and you see on the stones; if it is a son, you are to kill him, and if it is a daughter she shall live.” The Talmud states regarding this, 9 “What are the stone s to which the verse refers? Rabbi Chanan said: “ Pharaoh gave over a great and dependable sign of imminent childbirth to the midwives . He said to them, ‘ When a woman kneels to give birth, her thighs become as cold as stones. ’” Etz Chaim 10 explains that beca use the opening of the womb ( Yesod ) is very small, the child is not capable of coming out through it. Thus, when the period of Ibur (the development of the fetus during pregnancy ) is com plete , the fetus has fully developed into an infant and it now is tim e for its birth, the spiritual light and vitality of the aspect of NeHi”Y (the thighs) of Imma (the mother) withdraws fr om its place, and arises into the body of the mother hers elf. It is the withdrawal of this additional light and lif e force into the torso and womb of the mother which gives her the extr a force and strength to give birth to the baby, so that it can exit her womb. 11 However, because of the withdrawal of the light and life force f rom her thighs, they become as cold as stones. Now, from this analogy of how childbirth takes place in human beings , we may understand the analogue. T he “thighs” of the “mother” refer to the aspect of NeHi”Y of Imma ( Binah ). As mentioned above, the more one thinks about something in his brain of Binah , the more it expand s and grow s, and the emotional arousal of hi s thoughts and intellect concerning the matter bec ome expanded, until his mind can no longer contain the great arousal taking place within it. At this point the “infant”, i.e. the emotional arousal of the intellect , has been developed to the point that it can no longer be c ontained within the brain of comprehension. At this point, the emotions must be “born”, i.e. expressed, and brought forth into the heart with a ctual heartfelt emotional arousal. Howeve r, in order for the “child” (i.e. the heartfelt emotions) to be born, it is necessary for the intellect and reasoning to withdraw into itself. It is for this reason that when one has an arousal of his heartfelt emotions , his intellect and reasoning withdr aws. Because , the first NeHi”Y is withdrawn and a new NeHi”Y is drawn fo rth. That is, the aspects of NeHi”Y (i.e. the “thighs”) of the comprehension of Binah (i.e. the “mother”) are withdrawn in order to give rise to a heartfelt emotional arousal. Onl y afterwards does the intellect give forth a new NeHi”Y in order to develop the child ( as will soon be explained). If the intelle ct would not initially withdraw it would be impossible for an arousal of heartfelt emotions to take place . 12 From all of the ab ove we can clearly understand the particular explanation of how Zeir Anpin , the stature of the heartfelt emotions of the world of Atzilut , is born out of Abba (i.e. Chochmah ) and Imma (i.e. Binah ) of the world of Atzilut - Emanation.   8 Ex odus 1:16 9 Sota 11b 10 See Etz Chaim, Heichal Z”A, Shaar HaMochin, Chapter 3. 11 It is explained there that this additional life force and vitality within the torso ( Tiferet ) of the mother serves a third function as well. That is, it causes the milk to beg in to flow after childbirth so that the child can begin its second stage of maturation which is called “ Yenikah – Suckling”, as will be explained later. 12 It is for this reason that when one is having an intense emotional arousal, like anger, one cannot te ll him anything at all to calm him down. This is because his intellect has withdrawn and his emot ions are not a thing of reason."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"(However, the differe nce between the analogy and the analogue is clearl y understood. I n the analogy , the father, mother and infant are th ree separate entities and individuals . In contrast, in the analogue, Abba (i.e. the stature of Chochmah ), Imma (i.e. the stature of Binah , and Zeir Anpin (i.e. the st ature of the emotions) are all one single entity and being. 13 This is similar to the fact that in a human being, his wisdom is one with his essence, his understanding is one with his essence, and his emotions are one with his es sence. Likewise, Abba of the world of Atzilut is one with the Essence of G -d, Imma of the world of Atzilut is one with the Essence of G -d, and Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut is one with the Essence of G -d, as previously explained at length. Moreove r, there is another difference between the analogy and the analogue in that when a hum an mother gives birth, she loses that which was concealed in her. In contrast, when the emotions are born out of Binah comprehension, in truth there is no actual loss in Binah itself. The intellect m erely recedes. Clearly, [through Hitbonenut ] the same emotion may be brought forth again from Binah (Contemplation) afterwards , so there is no actual loss .) Part Five Now, after all of the above explanations regarding t he “birth” of Zeir Anpin , (T he heartfelt emotions of Atzilut ), we may now continue to understand of the various levels of the “maturation” of Zeir Anpin itself , once in is “ born ” . In the analogy, a physical child is initially born small and then undergoes different stages of maturation until he reaches his most complete state of maturity. Likewise, when the emotions are initially born out of the comprehension , they are brought forth in a completely “immature” state of being , because of the Tzimtzum - lessen ing between the intellect and the heartfelt emotions (i.e. the “ Meitzar HaGaron – the narrow of the neck”). At this point , there is almost a total w ithdrawal of the intellect, similar to a newborn infant who lacks almost all intellect. Afterwards, how eve r, the emotions slowly develop until , [finally], th ey reach a complete state of development, in which the ligh t of the intellect radiates to a great degree within the emotions. This may be understood as follows: When the emotions are in an aspect of a “fetus – Ibbur ” within the womb of the “mother - Imma ” ( Binah ), they are o nly in an aspect of “three within three etc”. That is, the “head” of ChaBa”D (The intellect) is within ChaGa”T (The emotion) , and ChaGa”T is within NeHi”Y (The gut emotion). This i s like the fetus in its mother’s womb. It is in the fetal position, folded over with its head is between its knees. Likewise, at this stage all that is revealed of the emotions is the aspect of NeHi”Y , which is called the “natural” [or instinctual] ( Mootb a ) aspect of the emotions. That is, the natural character of the child already exists even as it still is in its mother’s wo mb. This means that a kind and giving person ’s nature was already embedded in him at the very start of his inception and while he was being formed in the womb. Afterwards , when he is born and begins to gro w, these natural tendencies and emotions grow with him as well, in accordance to the growth and development of hi s intellect and   13 See Pardes Rimonim , Shaar 22, Chapter 1."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"reasoning. This is because the intellect and rea soning invests within them in a much more expansive manner than their original capacity , when they were first formed. We can clearly observe that when a person has a personality trait in his youth, t his trait is very small and undeveloped compared to how it later develops as his intellect expands and develops . An example of this is someone who is a spendthrift in his youth. As he grows and his intellect radiates to a greater degree , this characteristic and natural tra it will grow and develop to a far g reater degree than its original state when he was but a small child. This is because the intellect which vests within the emotion expands it, causing it to grow. As we can see, when a child is born, over time his emotions and characteristics slowly but s urely grow, but only in accordance to the growth of his i ntellect. This is the meaning of the verse, (Proverbs 12:8) “According to his wisdom shall a man be praiseworthy ”. This, then, is what is called “ Mochin D’Yenika – the Brains of Suckling”, which is the development of the natural character of the emotions ( NeHi”Y – Mootba ), according to the intellect. However, this growth is still only an aspect of “Immature Brains” ( Mochin D’Katnoot ), and is not at all within the category of “Mature Brains” ( Mochin D’Gadloot ). T his is because although the emotions are expanded according to the growth of the intellect, nevertheless, the intellect is invested in them only in a very greatly con cealed manner. That is, to the eye , all that can be see n is the natural ar ousal of the emotions (just as when he was a child). The only difference is that now this cha racter trait has become magnified to a greater degree than when he was an infant. Nevertheless, the intellect is completely and totally concealed. In the above example of a person who by nature is a spendthrift, it is the very same trait, but on a larger scale. Concealed within it , in its innermost depth , is the radiance of the intellect which causes it to grow and spre ad. Nevertheless, it still exists entirely as an emoti onal arousal, rather than an intellect one, except that now it is a bigger and greater expression of this same emotional trait. However, this is not the case in regard to the aspect of the “Mature Brains” ( Mochin D’Gadloot ) of Zeir Anpin . Thi s is when the emotions actually undergo a profound change of existence and actually exist as intellect. This is brought about by a complete revelation of the intellect and reasoning within the emotions of the heart. Moreover, here, the int ellect complete ly dominates the emotions (rather than vice versa) , to the point that there is no felt awaren ess of the arousal of the natural emotions , wh atsoever. Rather, there is a complete arousal and excitement of the intellect only, whereas the arousal of his he art felt emotions (although this indeed takes place ) is totally sublimated to and included in the intellectual arousal. Therefore, it does not exist as something separate and apart from it. This is similar to the matter of the intellectual arousal (explained in Kuntrus HaHitpaalut and in Part Three of ‘The Knowledge of G - d’). 14 We, t herefore , fi nd that through the revelation of “Mature   14 Included here is the explanation of the aspect of intellectual love and fear from part three of ‘The Knowledge of G - d’ (which is directly based on Kuntrus HaHitpa’alut and R’ Hillel Paritchers explanations there): When one’s heart becomes excited through his Hitbonenut and his emotions are completel y aroused, either with great longing, joy or bitterness etc., the entire length and breadth of the G -dly matter which he was contemplating becomes shortened during the actual emotional response. Just an impression of the contemplation remains, as it relat es to the excitement and arousal of his emotions only. The length and breadth of the contemplation, recedes and becomes concealed from consciousness. He is only left with"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Brains”, the state of the heartf elt emotions is actually transformed into intellectual existence. The effect of this is that i t actually enhances and exp ands the intellect itself. At this stage of development , each of the sefirot of the emotions also includes ten complete sefirot . Furthermore, we find that , in effect, this is the opposite of the aspect of the “Brains of Suckl ing” ( Mochin D’Yenikah ), in which the intellect is completely concealed and consumed       what is called a “ Tamtzit ” (The final essential conclusion), which is the “Therefor e” that follows the contemplation. The recognition of the truth of the “therefore” is what causes the excitement and arousal of his heart. (This is also the explanation of the verse in Genesis, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother etc ”. We explained earlier that “father and mother” refers to the Intellectual faculties of Chochmah and Binah . The word “man – Ish ” refers to Zeir Anpin , i.e. the emotions of the heart.) An example is one who contemplates how G - d permeates and “fills” all worlds ( Memaleh Kol Almin ). When his emotions towards G- d become aroused through this contemplation all that remains in his mind is the truth of the “Therefore”, in that he realizes the truth that G -d fills all worlds. Once he is aroused emotionally, the entire contemplation which preceded the “Therefore” recedes from his consciousness and becomes concealed. This level is called Mochin D’Katnut – “Brains of Smallness”. This means that the intellect (brains) becomes small and its light is concealed. All that remains is the Tamtzit (The final essential conclusion) , mentioned above. This level comes about when his contemplation does not reach the depth of the concept. Rather, he only brings the Divine concept closer to the comprehension of his mind by gr asping it externally through the allegories and explanations of his teacher. The depth of the concept (The Omek Hamoosag ) remains concealed. (Now, the difference between the Tamtzit and the Omek Hamoosag may be understood as follows: There are two typ es of essence. The “essence of mint” is not its true essence, but is rather what remains after it has been thoroughly processed until only its essential oil remains. This is the Tamtzit. In the same way, the Tamtzit of a concept is the “Therefore”, which follows the thorough processing of the concept through Hitbonenut - contemplation. In contrast, the true essence of mint is the source of the mint itself. This is similar to the Omek Hamoosag – the actual depth of the concept . The Omek Hamoosag is the ve ry depth and source of the concept itself. One who grasps the Omek Hamoosag, which is its very essence and source, has a radically different experience, as will now be explained.) When one’s excitement and arousal is caused by the actual essence of the w isdom, the Omek Hamoosag , which is the very depth and essence of the concept, the very opposite of the above is true. Instead of the intellect receding and becoming “shortened” during the arousal of the emotions, it actually expands due to the emotions of the heart. The arousal of the emotions does not become separated from the intellect, as in the previous level, but on the contrary, it actually strengthens the contemplation and is bound up with the comprehension. This is because the very depths of his m ind, heart and soul are completely involved and engrossed in the matter under contemplation. An example of this is that when a person’s entire heart and mind are completely involved in a personal or business matter or the like, his entire being becomes involved and drawn after it. Because of this deep involvement, since his entire mind, heart and soul are involved, the emotions of the heart are not consciously felt and act as an enhancement to the comprehension, rather than a distraction. This level is called Mochin D’Gadlut – “Brains of Largeness”. In other words, his mental capacities are actually enhanced by the involvement and excitement in the very depth of his heart. (This is in contrast to the external excitement of the emotions of the previous levels. This is an internal excitement and involvement in the very depth of the heart. However, this is not to say that the externality of his heart is not also excited with great arousal. Rather, it is not consciously felt because it is completely absor bed and sublimated to the light of the intellect.) This is the fourth level of Divine service, and is called “Intellectual Love and Fear”. "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"by the heartfelt em otions and causes them to grow and expand slowly . In contrast, the aspect of “Mature Brains” ( Mochin D’Gadlut ), is rather, the emotions which are conce aled and consumed by the int ellect until they themselves take on an existence of intellect and expand it, to the point that the emotion s themselves become transformed to exist as intellect. This is the main difference between the aspects of the immature b rains of “suckling” ( Mochin D’Yenikah ) and the mature brains ( Mochin D’Gadlut ). From all of the above we may now understand that in Zeir Anpin of Atzilut there also is the aspect of the immature brains ( Mochin D’Katnoot ) which are called “Brains of Suckli ng” ( Mochin D’Yenikah ). This is when the emotional sefirot of Zeir Anpin grow according to the influence they receive from the intellectual sefirot of Abba ( Chochmah ) and Imma ( Binah ) of Atzilut , which vests within them in a concealed manner. (This is th e asp ect of the six mundane days of C reation, as explained in chapter twenty six.) (As mentioned previously, the aspect of Ibbur – Pregnancy, is actually lower than this, for there is no true consciou sness or awareness of reality altogether . Rather, this state of Ibbur – Pregnancy is similar to the state of exile ( Galut ) which is called “sleep”, as previously explained. During this time the emotions of Atzilut are in their lowest and most im mature state of “three within three”, in which only the very low est level of the natural emotions are revealed ( NeHi”Y of NeHi”Y , which is called Mootba – the natural responses (Instinct). In chapter thirty this sleep state is explained at length). In contrast, there is the aspect of “Mature Brains” ( Mochin D’Gadloot ) of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut . This is to say that each of the emotional sefirot of Zeir Anpin includes ten sefirot , and the aspect of ChaBa”D (the intellectual aspect – Mooskal ) of each emotion comes into revelation and overpowers the felt emotional arousal ( Moorgash – ChaGa”T ) and the natural character of the emotions ( Mootba – NeHi”Y ). This causes the emotional sefirot of Zeir Anpin to be transformed into intellect, as explained above. (This is the aspect of the seventh day of Shabbat , as explained in ch apter twenty six.) This is when the entire light of Abba ( Chochmah ) becomes revealed and radiates within the “six directions” of Zeir Anpin , as stated, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name, and what ( Ma”H ) is his son’s name”. That is, the aspect of the Koach Ma”H of Chochmah (which is the complete sublimation to the depth of the intellectual subject matter) radiates within the aspect of Zeir Anpin , which is called Ma”H . Part Six We must now understand the difference between the inclusion of the emotions within Chochmah and the enclothement of Chochmah within the emotions. We must also understand the difference between the development which comes from Imma ( Binah ), which is called “ Gadloot Rishon D’Imma – the first maturation of Imma ”, and the difference between “ Gadloot Sheni D’Abba – the second maturation of Abba ( Chochmah )”. It was previously explained that as the “child” (i.e. the emotions) is originally included in the “father” (i.e. Abba or Chochmah ) it exist s there as part and parcel of intellect and Choch mah , rather than actual emotions altogether . For example, the aspect of Chessed (Kindness) of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Chochmah is the intellectual leaning and pull of Chochmah towards kindness. This, literally , is an intellectual power and not an emotion at all. For the primar y quality here is that of Chochmah and , therefore, the emotions included in Chochmah , also exist as Chochmah , literally. Now, it is further understood from all that was previously stated that it is specifically in the light of Abba ( Chochmah ) that there is a complete inclus ion of the emotions. T his is not the case , however, when the emotions are included in the light of Imma ( Binah ). This is because as the emotions are included in Binah they do not have an actual transformation of their existence, as o ccurs in Chochmah . Rather, they have their own existence and state of being as emotions, except that they are still concea led within the comprehension of Binah, as a fetus in its mother ’s womb. However, while they are in the comprehension of Binah, this c auses them to grow, like a fetus “wh o eats what his mother eats”, f or, as was previously understood from the above, the main difference between “the brains of suckling” ( Mochin D’Yenikah ) and “the mature brains” ( Mochin D’Gadloot ) is that, during the perio d of “suckling” it is only the nature and characteristics of the emotions which are caused to grow because of the invest ment of the intellect within them in a concealed manner. This is similar to a child who suckles from his mother ’s milk and thereby gr ow s. Likewise, although the emotions become more developed, they are still the very same emotions, except that they are expanded and enlarged to spread forth to a greater degree , a s previously explained. This may also be compared to a tree which grows wh en watered. Although it grows , nonetheless, it exists as the very same tree , and its state of being is not transformed, whatsoever , through its developme nt except that n ow it is bigger. Likewise, in this state of development of the heart felt emotions the re is no transformation of the nature of the emotions at a ll, even when they grow due to the influence of the intellect of Binah , which is concealed within them. The intellect of Binah which vests within the emotions does not cause them to be changed from a state of being of emotions to a state of being of intellect, but rather, it merely expands the emotions, as emotions . However, this is not the case in regard to “the mature brains” ( Gadloot HaMochin ) of the light of Abba ( Chochmah ) which vest within the emot ions during a state of maturity. It does indeed transform the very nature of the emotions causing them to actually become included as part and parcel of the intellect, even expanding the intellect rather than the emotions. (Nonetheless, this does not detract from the existence of the emotions and the development and growth that they first received from the brain of Imma ( Binah ), as will be explained.) (The reason that Chochmah and Binah each influence the emotions different ly is because of the dif ference in the manner of how the emotio ns were originally included in them. While the emotions were included in Chochmah they were included there literally as one with the intellect of Chochmah itself, and did n ot have any recognizable or noticeable exist ence as emotions whatsoever . That is, as they were in Chochmah they had the existence of Chochmah its elf, like the seminal drop as it is still included in the brain of the father. The re the child has no recogni zable existence whatsoever . Therefore, when the light of Chochmah radiates into the emotions, the state of being of the emotion s actually takes on a transformation to become one with the intellect and actually expand the intellect. In contrast, the way the emotions were included in Binah , they a lready had some kind of recognizable existe nce, like a fetus in its mother ’s womb. Moreover, the existence of the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"fetus is not actually one with the mother’s existence , in the same way as it was with the father. This is because the mother is the host and carrier of the seminal drop of the father , but not its originator. Rather, she develops the fetus and its na ture and character which it received from the father. Thus, when the intellect of Binah becomes invested within the emoti ons it causes the emotio ns to develop and expand, but not to undergo a change of being in the m. Moreover, even during the growth and expansion of the arousal of the emotions as it comes from Binah , the intellect is completely concealed and hidden. This is not the case with th e aforementioned radiance and investment of Chochmah into the heartfelt emotions. T here , they actually have a change in their state of being to become intellect and expand the intellect and comprehension.) Part Seven We must now understand the differ ence between how the emotions are originally included in the light of Abba (which is called “ Hitkalleloot – Inclusion”), and how the light of Abba vests within the fully developed emotions (which is called “ Hitlabshoot – Investment”), since, in both circum stances the emotions undergo a transformation of their state of being to become actual intellect, according to the light of Abba ( Chochmah ). In order to understand this, however, we must first understand the general difference between the concept of “ Hitk alleloot – Inclusion” and “ Hitlabshoot – Enclothement”. The aspect of “Inclusion – Hitkalleloot ” is that something is totally included and sublimated , just as a secondary matter is tota lly sublimated to the primary matter. An example of this is the Talmu dic statement “Included in two hundred is one hundred”, and the like. A further example is that it is like th e letters of the intellect, as they are included in the essence o f the power to conceptualize itself, wherein they do not appear to have any exist ence in and of themselves at all. This is because, while a person is delving into the depths of Chochmah , the letters of intellect are totally sublimated, secondary to, and included in the essential being of the intellect itself, as is clearly observable. The same is true of the aspect of the emotions as they are included in Chochmah . For example, the intellectual leaning towards kindness is totally included and sublimated to the essential light of the intellect itself, to the point that it does not ap pear to have any existence of its own, whatsoever. This being the case, it is und erstood that as the emotions exist included in the light of Abba ( Chochmah ), they are in the ultimate state of smallness and “immaturity”. This is not because of a Tzimtzum or a lessening of the light of the emotions, but simply because they are considered as being nothing in comparison to the primary essence of the intellect itself. Thus, the emotions as they are included in Chochmah are in their smallest s tate, to the poin t that , for all practical purposes, they cannot be considered to even exist. "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Such is not the case, however, once the emotions have been developed and “ born ” out of the womb of the “mother – Imma ” ( Binah ), and during the period of “Suckling – Yenikah ” whic h causes them to grow and expand etc. At this point it is the opposite of the above, and the emotions are in their main state of being, in that they exist and are reve aled. Therefore, in the state of “ Gadloot – Maturity”, although the light of Abba ( Choc hmah ) radiates within them with great intensity and radiance to the point that the very natur e of the emotions becomes transformed into an intellectual nature and they even have an effect on the intellect to expand it, never theless, in their full developme nt and spreading forth, the emotions still retain the ir own existence. The only difference is that now the light of the intellect is invested in them. However, this invest ment of the intellect within the emotions is not similar to the aforementioned as pect of inclusion ( Hitkalleloot ). This is because “Invest ment – Hitlabshoot ” means that the intellect completely vests within the emotions an d conducts them according to intellect alone, so much so , that they become completely united with it as one. This is to say that the arousal and excitement of the intellect becomes one with the arousal and excitement of the emot ions (which is not the case in regard to the aspect of Yenika – Suckling, in which the arousal of the emotions is separate and apart from the intellect since the intellect is completely concealed.) However, in regard to the Investment ( Hitlabshoot ) of the state of Maturity ( Gadloot ), it is not that the emotions become totally nul lified and sublimated out of existence relative to the intellect, as it is in regard to the aspect of the inclusion ( Hitkalleloot ) of the emotions within Chochmah . This, then, is the difference between the aspect of the inclusion of the emotions with in the light of Abba ( Chochmah ), and the aspect of the invest ment of th e light of Abba ( Chochmah ) into the emotions. (As previously explained, the statement, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name, and what ( Ma”H ) is his son ’s name” refers to when the aspect of the light ( Ma”H ) of Abba ( Chochmah ) radiates within Zeir Anpin , which is calle d “his son”. 15 This statement applies, however, whether we are speaking of the aspect of the inclusion ( Hitkalleloot ) of Zeir Anpin (the emotions) within Abba ( Chochmah ) or whether we are speaking of the invest ment of Abba ( Chochmah ) within Zeir Anpin (the emotions).) From all of the above it is understood that there is a vast difference between how the emotions are totally included within Chochmah and how the light of Chochmah vests within the emotions in their most developed state. For example, there is a vast difference between the intellectual leaning towards kindness (which is purely intellectual), and the aspect of the great arousal of the heartfelt emotion of love and kindness which is unified with the intellect to the point that it is actually one with t he intellectual arousal, rather than separate from it (as previously explained). This is because in the latter “ mature ” state of the emotions , a complete transformation of its state of being does not take place. In other words, it itself is not ac tual intellect . Rather, it is like the relationship of a horse and a rider, in which the horse can carry the rider a much   15 This is in accordance with the known explanation of the verse, “My son, my firstborn, Yisrael ” (Exodus 4:22)."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"further distance, in a shorter amount of time, than would be possible if the rider had to walk by himself. However , the horse only g oes where the rider direct s it. Similarly, in the mature state of arousal , the emotions are as one with the intellect , like the relationship between a horse and rider. Moreover, on this level, the arousal of the emotions actually exp ands the intellect an d takes the person much deeper into his intellectual delving and comprehension (as kno wn in regard to the fourth level of arousal , explained in Kuntrus HaHitpa’alut and Part Three of “The Knowledge of G - d”.) This will suffice those of understanding. Part Eight From all of the above we now clearly see that there are three general states in the development of the heartfelt emotions until they reach their most complete state with the full investment of the Light of Abba into the emotions of Zeir Anpin (which is called “ Gadloot HaMochin – Mature Brains”). The first state of the emotions is the “fetal” state of Ibbur - Pregnancy, in which the emotions receive their natural composition within the intellect. The second state of the emotions is after the emotions are born and the natural composition of the emotions is developed according to the hidden radiance of the intellect. This second state is called Yenikah – Suckling, in which the emotions “suckle” intellect from the “mother”, i.e. from the compre hension and intellect of Imma ( Binah ). The third state of the emotions comes after the nature of the emotio ns is fully developed in its completeness, and the light of Abba vests within the emotions , as explained above at length. This state is called Mo chin – Intellect, and is the aspect of how the emotions are in their complete state, in which the light of Chochmah fully radiates within them, and their arousal is not at all separate from the intellectual arousal. 16 17 Thus, the first general category, whi ch is the lowest general state of emotional arousal, is as it is det ached from the intellect and subject of his contemplation and comprehension. The second general level and category is as the emotions do indeed receive a revealed revelation of intellec t and are indeed aroused directly by the subject that he contemplates, however , when his emotions are aroused by the intellect , the reasoning and comprehension is, nonetheless, withdrawn and concealed. This is because his arousal is only from the aspect of the Tamtzit – the “Therefore” which results from his contemplation and comprehension. The third general level of arousal of the emotions is when the emotional arousal i s not detach ed from his conte mplation, but on the contrary is one with it. In this state his contemplation and comprehension does not become withdrawn by the arousal of heartf elt   16 See Etz Chaim, Shaar 3, Chapter 3 . "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"emotions, but rather, is expanded through the arousal of his heart. This comes about because he comprehends into the Omek HaMoosag – The intangible depth of t he comprehension , which comes from the Koach Ma”H of Chochmah , in which his heart is totally sublimated to his mind , just as a horse is totally sublimated to its rider, as previously explained at length. From all of the above we can now understand the two general states of Zeir Anpin which are called Yaakov and Yisrael : Yaakov refers to the immature state of the emotions as they are separate from the arousal of the intellect (in which case the revelation of the intellect is withdrawn and diminished bec ause the arousal of the heart overpowers the intellect). In contrast, Yisrael refers to the mature state of the emotions when the light of Chochmah is vested within them (in which case the nature of the emotions is ruled by the intellect, and the intell ect overpowers the arousal of the heart). This will now be further explained and elucidated in chapter thirty -four. End of Introduction to Chapter Thirty -Four"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty Four Now, in the aspect of Zeir Anpin of [the world of] Atzilut (Emanation) there are two levels, which are called Yisrael (Israel) and Yaakov (Jacob), 1 as is known. [We will now ] explain t he [various] particulars and the levels in this. 2 H owever, we must first understand that the reason it is called by the name Yisrael is “because y ou have ruled over Elokim etc”. 3 This is   1 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaKelipot ) Shaar 48, Chapters 2 & 3. 2 In previous chapters the Rebbe explained how from both the aspect of the lights and the aspect of the vessels, Zeir Anpin (i.e. the emotional sefirot ) of the world of Atzilut is totally bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light, (i.e. “He and His l ife force and He and His organs are one etc”). The Rebbe will now begin to explain all the particular levels, aspects and expressions of the emotional sefirot of Zeir Anpin itself. As previously mentioned, all man ’ s organs, natural characteristi cs and li fe stages etc, hint at great and profound matters in G -d's conduct toward the worlds. These conducts are called by the names of the stages corresponding to them. The general principle is that everything found in man hints at G -d's conduct toward His Crea tion. Thus, in this ch apter the Rebbe will continue employing the analogy of man and his development ( i.e. e mbryonic - Ibur, infancy - Yenika , c hildhood - Katnut , and, adulthood – Gadlut ) as an analogy to explain the various modes of conduct of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut which affects the st ate of the rest of Creation which follows it . 3 Genesis 32:29 . This verse refe rs to the Biblical incident in which Yaakov wrestled with the angel of his brother Esav. When Yaak ov overpowered the angel, the angel blessed Ya akov and changed his name , so that Yaakov should release him . The verse states, “You shall no longer be called by the name Yaakov , but rather Yisrael ; for you have ruled over Elokim (G - d) etc.” When angels are performing a mission of G -d, they are called by G - d’s name ( Elokim ) because of the general rule that “a person ’ s emissary is like himself”. Therefore, the simple meaning of this verse is that Yaakov ruled over the angel of Esav , and therefore his name was changed to “ Yisrael – .” ישראל The Hebrew w ord “ Yisrael – ישראל” is a composite of the two words “ Yasar E -l – יש \" ר א \" ל ” meaning, “Ruled over E-l (G - d)”. On a deeper, mystical level, the aspect of Yisrael represents the aspect of Zeir Anpin , as it states, “My son, my firstborn, Yisrael ” (Exodus 4 :22 ). As explained before , Chochmah and Binah are called “Father – Abba ” and “Mother – Imma ”, while Zeir Anpin and Nukvah are called the “son” and “daughter” (see Chapter 2). Now, regarding the verse , “A sun and a shield is Havayah Elokim ” , it is expla ined that the aspect of Elokim represents the concealment of the revelation of the essential name of Havayah . (The name of G - d “ Elokim – אלה \" ים” has a numerica l value of 86, which is numerical value of the word “ HaTeva – Nature ( ”) הטבע ). Therefore, it is understood that the name Elokim represents the aspect of Tzimtzum and concealmen t, as will later be explained at greater length. Simila rly, as the Rebbe will soon state, “You have ruled over Elokim ” is the same concept as the matter of “The name of Ma”H ( מ \" ה ) rules over the name Ba”N ( ב \" ) ן”. For, as previously mentioned, the name of Ma”H – 45 ( מ \" ה ) shares the numeri cal value of the word “ Adam – man אדם ( ” ). In contrast, the name of Ba”N – 52 ( ב \" ן ) shares the numerical value of the word for “Animal – Behemah בהמה ( ” ). Thus, this aspect of “ruling over Elokim ” represents the aspect of the intellect ( Koach Ma”H ) ruling over the nature of the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"the [matter of the] name of Ma”H – 45 ( מ \" ה ) which clarifies and rules over the name of Ba”N – 52 ( ב \" ן ), 4 for [it states], 5 “They are clarified with Chochmah ”, and, 6 “It is in the power of the man to clarify”, and, 7 “It is the nature of man to conquer etc”. 8       heartfelt emotions. (This is the fundamental difference betwee n man and animal. That is, man, through his intellect has the ability to rul e over his instinctual emotions and de sires. In contrast, an animal is ruled completely by his instinct s and emoti ons.) As explained before, the emotions are revealed through a Tzimtzum - lessening (the “narrow of the neck – Meitzar HaGaron ”). Because of this lessening, when the emotions are initially born, the length and breadth of the intellect and comprehension o f Binah , from which they come, actually recedes and becomes concealed, as is clearly obser vable. (Therefore, when a person thinks , acts , or speaks during a stat e of emotional arousal he usually becomes irrational.) Thus, when the emoti ons are initially r evealed they overpower the intellect thus causing the withdrawal of the revelation of the intellect. (In such a state the emotions “rule” and “overpower” the intellect.) At this point the intellect only radiates wi thin them in a diminished fashion, simil ar to the e motions of a child as compared to those of an adult. This lower aspect, in which of the heartfelt emotions of Zeir Anpin are in a state of immaturity, is called Yaakov . (The name Yaakov ( יעקב = 182) has a numerical value of two times Elokim , plus the ten letters of these two names (i.e. אלה \" ים אלה \" ים = 182). Etz Chaim explains that these two names of Elokim represent an influence of the intellect of Chochmah and Binah in a completely diminished and concealed form.) It is only after the em otions have “matured” through the additional influence and radiance of the intellect within them (which is called Yenika – Suck ling), that the emotions become a proper vessel for the light of the intelle ct. When this occurs the emotions no longer rule ove r the “intellect”, but rather, the opposite is true. T he intellect now rules and overpowers the emotional arousal. At this point the arousal of the h eart no longer interferes with intellectual arousal, nor does it cause the light of the intellect to be co ncealed or withdrawn. Rath er, because the emotions become sublimated and “under the rule” of the intellect, the arousal of the heartfelt emotions actually causes an expanded state of intellect, as explained in the introduction. Because of this, no longer are the emotions called Yaakov but are called Yisrael instead. Th is means that there is now a change of state from the emotions overpowering the intellect (as in an animal – Ba”N ). Rather, they act similar to a man ( Ma”H ) whose intellect overrules and ov erpowers the emotions. This , then , is the mystical explanation of the verses mentioned above (that Yaakov’ s name was changed to Yisrael “because you have ruled over Elokim ” etc). (See Etz Chaim ( Shaar Leah V’Rachel ) Shaar 38, Chapter 2.) 4 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar TaNT”A ) Shaar 5, Chapter 1. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Dvarim , Vol.1, p.5, and Vol.2, p.573, and Vol.4, p.1213 ( א ' ריג ). 5 See Zohar ( Hechalot ) Pekudei 254b. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Dvarim , Vol.1, p.295, and Shmot , Vol.2, p.321. 6 See Pri Etz Chaim ( Shaar Tefilah ) Shaar 1, Chapter 7. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim , p. 543. 7 See Tracta te Yebamot 65b. 8 From the introduction to the chapter, the explanation of the statement of the Zohar , “they are clarified (or refined) with Chochmah ”, may be understood. That is, it is specifically when the light of Chochmah vests within the emotions tha t it effects a profound transformation of their nature. In other words, this is specifically when the aspect of the “ Koach Ma”H – The Power of What” (i.e. the sublimation) of Chochmah radiates within the emotions. As explained in the introduction, until the light of Chochmah vests within the heartfelt emotions, the emotions overpower the light of the intellect causing it to be withdrawn and diminished. In contrast, when the light of Chochmah (i.e. Koach Ma”H ) vests withi n the emotions, the emotions becom e totally sublimated to it , “like a horse to a rider”. Because of thi s, the nature of the emotions becomes refined and completely transformed etc. This is the name of Ma”H – 45 ( מ \" ה ) which refers to the emotional sefirot of the world of Atzilut (i.e. Zeir Anpin ) as they receive from the Koach Ma”H of Chochmah . As mentioned above, the name Ma”H ( מ \" ה ) has a numerica l value of 45, which is the numerical value of the word Adam – Man. It is specifically this"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" In order to explain these things we must first understand the difference between the aspect of Yisrael Saba (The Elder Israel) and Yisrael Zoota (The Little Israel). 9 T he aspect of the emotional [ sefirot ] of Chochmah itself are called “ Yisrael Saba – The Elder Israel”. No w, there are two levels in this: The fir st [level] is the emotions that are in the Light of Abba ( Ohr Abba ), and the second [level is] the emotions that are in the Hidden Chochmah ( Chochmah Stima’ah ). This is called “The First Man – Adam Kadma’a ” in the terminology of the Zohar . 10 Regarding this it states, “What ( Ma”H ) is his name, and what ( Ma”H ) is his son ’s name”. 11 Now, the emotions which are low er than Chochmah [intellect] are called “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Israel”, for they are in an aspect of immaturity. [T his is] because they come [to be revealed] through the diminishment and concealment of the main essence of the intellect. [All that is revealed] is what the external vessels of Netzach and Hod of Abba draw forth to give rise and bring out an intellect for kindness ( Chessed ) and love, which is called “ Chessed Zoota – The Little Kindness ”. (This may be compared to the seminal drop which is in the brain of the father etc. Similarl y, it states “What ( Ma”H ) is his son ’s name” in reference to “ Yisrael Zoota – The Little Israel” , which is drawn from the seminal drop of Abba (The Father) [i.e. Chochmah ] etc, as known.) 12 Now from the aspect of NeHi”Y of Abba , [influence] is drawn into N eHi”Y of Imma . [ NeHi”Y of Imma ] is the aspect of the influencing and lowering of the com prehension and reasoning of this emotion of kindness. However, the aspect of NeHi”Y of Imma is withdrawn during the birthing and revelation of the arousal of the attri bute of love and the like, [of the heartfelt emotions]. For, as is clearly observable, the reasoning and the intellect becomes abbreviated and withdrawn during the arousal of the [he artfelt] emotions. (This [expla ins] the matter of, “You shall see on the birthing stones” , i.e. that the thighs become col d during the time of birth ing . 13 [This is] b ecause, the first NeHi”Y is withdrawn and a new NeHi”Y is drawn forth, as explained elsewhere.) This is called the aspect of, “Breaking through Yesod of Imma ”, to give birth to the [heartfelt] emotion. A t first, the [emotion of] love is hidden and concealed, included in the intellect, like a fetus in the womb of its mother.       essential aspect of Zeir Anpin as it receives from the light of the Koach Ma”H ( כח מ \" ה ) of Chochmah ( חכמה ) which has the capability to refine, clarify or “conquer” the original animalistic ( ב \" ן – Ba”N = Behema – Animal – בהמה ) and natural ( אלה \" ים – Elokim = HaTeva – Nature – הטבע ) s tate of the emotions, which was brought about because of the Tzimtzum - lessening ( Meitzar HaGaron – The narrow of the neck), and the withdrawal of the intellect when the emotions were “born” . (This was e xplained at great l ength in the introduction to this chapter.) Thus, the relationship between the three statements mentioned in the paragraph above is self understood. This is the same concept as the aspect of Yisrael whose name was changed from Yaakov b ecause he “ruled over Elokim ”. 9 See Zohar VaYakhel 216a. 10 “ Adam Kadma’a – The First Man” (which refers to the hidden Chochmah of Arich Anpin ) should not be confused with “ Adam Kadmon – Primordial Man” (which refers to the Ratzon L’Ratzon – Desire for the Desire), as previously explained . 11 This was explained at length in part one of the introdu ction to this chapter . 12 Two ways of reading this parag raph, either in a generally or particular ly, were offered in part one of the introdu ction to this chapter . 13 Exodus 1:16. See also Tractate Sota 11b, and Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaMochin ) Shaar 20, Chapter 3. See also Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe) Balak 105b. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Dvarim, Vol.2, p.378."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"However, after the [heartfelt] emotions are born they include the kindnesses ( Chassadim ) of Abba and the judgments ( Gevurot ) of Imma with all their general and particular aspects. 14 Now, there are three levels in this : 15 There is the aspect of “ Mochin D’Yenika – The Intellect of Suckling”, the aspect of “ Mochin D’Gadlut Rishon D’Imma – The Int ellect of the First Maturation from Imma ”, and “ Gadlut Sheni D’Abba – The Second Maturation from Abba ”, as known. As known, t he expl anation of these things is that the emotions are in an as pect of a fetus, three within three. That is, only the externalit y of NeHi”Y [is revealed]. I ncluded within them in a concealed manner are ChaBa”D and ChaGa”T . [This is to say that] these are only the [instinctual] nature of the emotions. 16 Through suckling ( Yenikah ), they become developed and prepared to receive intel lect. This is similar to a child whose limb s grow from suckling his mother ’s milk, as known . 17 [This continues] until when he is six years of age he   14 This paragraph was expl ained at great leng th in parts one, two, and four of the introduction to this chapter . 15 That is, because there is a Tzimtzum between the intellect and the emotions and because the light of the intelle ct is withdrawn during the arousal of the emotions, therefore, there are different degrees of arousal of the heartfelt emotions according to the manner of the intellect or the degree o f revelation of intellect within the emotions. There are three general categories of influence from the intellect which effect the development o f the emotions of Zeir Anpin from their embryonic state - Ibur , until complete maturation Gadlut HaMochin – Th e Mature Intellect. (This is because, as understood from all the previous explanations regarding Light s and Vessels and as understood from the intr oduction to this chapter, there are different stages or states of how the light radiates within the vessels. Similarly, there are different stages and states of how the light of the intellect radiates within the vessels of the emotions. As mentioned abo ve, the cause of the different stages is the manner (and Tzimtzum ) in which the light of the intellect is influenced into the vessels of the emotions. The effect is that there are different states and stages of the existe nce of the emotions, and just as t his is the case regarding the physical analogy, so too, there are various spi ritual stages of maturity in a person’s spiritual growth. These are caused through the radianc e of the G -dly intellect that he achieves through Hitbonenut - contemplation . That is, there are different stages and states of love and fear of G -d (i.e. relationship with G - d), which are a result of a person’s awareness of G-d, which, in turn , is caused by the difference in his level and manner of Hitbonenut - contemplation. Correspondi ngl y, there are different stages in how Zeir Anpin (the emotions which are called “the body of the King – Goofa D’Malka ”) of the world of Atzilut receives influence of the intellectual light of Abba and Imma , which in turn, effects the entire chainin g down of the worlds .) 16 See footnote 31 of chapter thirty . It was explained there that this state is compared to the exile - Galut (which is called the exile of the Divine Presence – Galut HaShechinah ) in which there is only a glimmer of a glimmer of the revelation of the True Reality of G -d. This is because of the withdrawal of the Light of the intellectual sefirot (as will be explained at lengt h later, when the “sleep of Zeir Anpin – Durmita D’Zeir Anpin ” is explained ). This is to say that there is only a greatl y diminished light of ChaBa”D which is concealed within ChaGa”T , which in turn, only radiate s in a greatly diminished fashion within NeHi”Y . This is similar to a “fetus” or one who is sleeping (in the fetal position etc.) in which his head is folded into his chest, which is between his knees. Thus, all that is revealed is only an extremely diminished state of awareness (which is in a state of confusion similar to a dream), of only NeHi”Y of NeHi”Y (i.e. the Nefesh of the Nefesh ). (Nevertheless, even a fe tus possesses all two hundred and forty eight limbs mentioned above, except that they are very “tiny”, like the body of an infant.) All that is revealed is the physical nature ( NeHi”Y or Mootba ) of the world. This is like a sleep state or a fetal state i n which one is completely unaware of true reality , yet is nevertheless dependant and sublimated to it. 17 As explained in chapter thirty, through Hitbonenut - contemplation the vessels become further developed and capable of receiving the next level of the so ul (lights) , so that it automatically becomes revealed and drawn forth (into th e vessels). (For, as explained before , all drawing forth of the si mple light into the vessels comes about specifically through rectifying the vessels and preparing them to be proper receptacles"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"       for the light . (This is analogous to the drawing forth of the s imple power of sight through repairing the eye, which is the vessel for the power of sight, or by creating additional vessels , such as eye glasses etc. As previously explain ed, there is no lacking in the simple light or form. Because of this a blind person is capable of giving birth to a fully sighted child.) The light is then automatically drawn forth in accordance to the vessel, as explained regarding the statement, “It is the nature of man to pursue a woman”.) Now, p hysically, the period of suckling ( Yenikah ) is from age zero until age two (twenty -four months). During this period an infant’s na tural character and emotions become revealed. However, h is actions an d emotio ns are purely instinctual, such as those of an animal. In other words, he is only drawn toward what he feels is good for him , and repulsed by what he feels is bad for him . He received the nature of his emot ions and character when he was still in the wo mb . This includes the natur e to be kind or cruel, generous or miserly, soft hearted or hard hearted, humble or arrogant, happy or depressed etc. In general these may be divided into two categories : Chessed – Kindness and Gevurah – Might (or Judgment), i. e. either positive (good) or negative (bad). This is likewise the case regarding all the other attributes, such as Tiferet ( Hitpa’aroot – self esteem ) , Netzach (the natural desire for conquest) etc. Each individual i s born with a certain composition of c haracteristics which make up his instinctual nature. In this way each person is different from his fellow . Although everyone possess es all these qualities, nonetheless, one person is un like the next in the particular revelations of these attributes. One person’s soul will lean more towards Chessed , while another ’s will lean more towards Gevurah , and yet another will lean more towards Tiferet etc. (As explained elsewhere, this depends upon where a person ’s soul is rooted.) Nevertheless, while he was in t he womb his instinctive emoti ons and nature were concealed, and there was no awareness or recognition of these qualities at all. They were not yet even revealed to himself , since they were not yet felt emotions. Therefore, they certainly were not yet reve aled to others. The most basic nature of all people, however, is the instinct to be drawn after that which is good for them and repulsed by that which is bad for them. However, even this basic nature is not revealed while the fetus is still in the womb. (Elsewhere it is explained that the reason that at this stage they are called Mootba – Natural ( מוטבע ) is not only from the word Teva – Nature ( טבע ), but is related to the terminology of “They were sunken in the reed sea - Toob’oo B’Yam Soof ( בים סוף טובעו )”. (Exodus 15:4) That is, they are in a complete state of concealment, because in this state although the intrinsic nature is already imbedded there, nonetheless, it is utterly concealed.) Similarly, in the analogue, during exile the true nature of reality is concealed in the world. This is compared to a fetus – Ibur in its mother’s womb . That is, the true nature of the world’s total sublimatio n and unity to G-d is totally concealed. Because of this, even the lowest basic nature of this reality , that the fulfillment of G- d’s will is good for a person whereas striving after worldly pleasures is bad for him, is concealed. It is for this reason that in such a state of concealment it is possible for a person to be come completely drawn after the many vanities of this world, thinking that they are good for him, whe n in truth they are actually harmful and damaging to his soul. Now, once the infant is born , his intrinsic instincts and character begins to be revealed (with all his particular characteristics and attributes ). That is, through the suckling ( Yenikah ) of his mother’s milk he begins to grow and the natu ral character of his emotions becomes revealed and developed. This is similarly the case with the first stage of the emotions which is aroused through Hitbonenut – contemplation. Through a person’s contemplation of the teachings of Chassidus and Ka bbalah, he acknowledges the absolute truth of the G - d’s existence, and recognizes the lowliness of matters of the world. This motivates him to come close to G -d through action ( Nefesh ) by the acceptance of the Heavenly yoke in performing G - d’s Mitzvo t- commandments. Nonetheless, he has not yet attained any actual revelation of G -dliness because he is still not even on a level of actual heartfelt love and fear of G -d ( which would be an aspect of his Ruach ). Rather, he still perceives himself as a comp letely separate entity from G-d, and is drawn towards the physical pleasures and temptations of the world. However, he has become aware of and acknowledges that, in reality, only matters of G -dliness are good for him while the vanities"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"possesses intellect in his emotio ns, but in a very limited fashion . 18 However, [now] his actions and ways have an aspect [and degree] of reasoning and intellect, and are not just the natural instinctive emotions [which are] only like those of an animal. 19       and lusts of the w orld are bad for him . Therefore, he makes a commitment in regard to his actions, to fulfill the commandments. In other words, at this stage he is only on a level of cold acknowledgement, which leads him to act upon his convictions, through desisting from evil – i.e distancing himself from that which is damaging to him , and fulfilling the positive commandments – i.e drawing close to that which is good for him . This is similar to a child who submits to the commands of his mother etc, even though he himself may still emotionally be drawn to do otherwise. ( The gauge of how much of this natural level of the soul is revealed is the strength of his commitment to G -d and the fulfillment of His commandments, specifically in action. ) This continues until age six, as will now be discussed. 18 Prior to six years of age a child does not have any deep connection ( Da’at ) to anything, and can therefore easily be persuaded to go from one thing to its opposite (as explained in chapter one regarding the statement of the Sa ges that, “A child has no Da’at ”). In contrast, at the six of age we see that a child already has more of a heartfelt connection (which comes because of the additional radiance of the intellectual connection of Da’at ) to different things. For this reason , when a six year old child chooses something, or chooses to do something etc, it is because he himself feels a certain personal connection to it. Because of this there is a Halachic legal ruling that prior to six years of age a person is considered to be a child in al l respects. That is, before he is six years old all of his transactions are consi dered to have no validity or meaning whatsoever. In contrast, at the age of six a child may possess enough intellect for his small transactions to be considere d valid and binding. This is because his “yes” is a “yes” and his “no” is a “no”. (See Tractate Gittin 59a , and Mishneh Torah L’HaRambam , Sefer Kinyan, Hilchot Mechirah 9:6.) That is, prior to the age of six he does not have an appreciation of right or w rong etc. on his own. Likewise in the analogy, prior to the “age of six” the only reason a child acts according to the dictates of his parents or teachers etc, is because of the appreciation that it is good for him to accept the yoke of his parent’s or teacher’s commands etc. (which indicates a certain degree of intellect recognition and comprehension). However, if he was not aware that his actions were being supervised, he would act according to the dictates of his own desires and pleasures (which may not be in accordance to the rules and guidelines set by his parents or teachers etc). This is because he does not yet have any true or deep appreciation of the goodness, in and of himself, in a personal way. He only understands that he must obey his parent s and teachers. Similarly, in the analogue, prior to the “age of six”: Through a person’s Hitbonenut contemplation he achieves a level of realization and acknowledgment of the truth of G - d’s existence and supervision, and this becomes manifest in his s trongly held conviction and commitment to fulfill G - d’s laws as set forth in the Torah. (In other words, even in this lower level there is a certain degree of intellect in that he acknowledges and appreciates that he must obey G - d’s will. This is called H oda’ah . In contrast, prior to this acknowledgment and awareness it is possible for him to disobey and even transgress G - d’s will, i.e. when he is in a state of “sleep” or “ Ibur ”.) Nevertheless, his heart may still actually be drawn towards the opposite o f G - d’s will. However, now, when he reaches the age of six, a new level of his soul is aroused, in which he has an actual personal connection to matters of G -dliness on his own and feels them to be good and beneficial to him. This is qualitatively superi or to the previous external acknowledgement. The general difference between these two levels may be understood as follows: There is a vast difference between a person’s appreciation of the value of someone else’s million dollar business deal as opposed t o his own fifty -thousand dollar business deal. Although he will greatly appreciate his friend’s million dollar business deal, nonetheless, this will not at all compare to the heartfelt arousal which will result from his own personal business deal, even th ough it is of much lesser monetary value. This is because the million dollars are “distant” and unrelated to him, while the fifty thousand dollars are “close” to him and will affect him personally. "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"       Likewise, in the analogu e, when a person reaches the sta te of awareness in which matters of G -dliness become personal, there certainly is a much , much greater vitality in his service of G -d, in the performance of the mitzvot - commandments, similar to the vitality that one has in his own personal business affairs . Th us, the second level which arises from contemplation of G -dliness, is this type of thought, in which the mind becomes attached to G -dliness as something which is directly and personally relevant and meaningful to him. This is called a “good th ought” which becomes connected to action (as opposed to only the “cold thought” of the first level, mentioned above) . In other words, thi s type of thought gives rise to actual heartfelt love and fear of G -d. However, this too is only as it relates to doing the mitzvot (Commandments) in action . This is in contradistinction from the first level which is called, “cold thought”, in which only an acknowledgement and commitment to G -dliness exist from afar. The only thing born of it is his embarrassment and shame, t hrough his realization of just how far he is from G -dliness. Because he realizes the lowliness of this world and its affairs, he makes a commitment to desist from evil (the 365 negative commandments) and to do the 248 positive commandments. However, this is only because he realizes and acknowledges that it is a very proper and right thing for him to do, and is the true path to achieving his ultimate goal, which is closeness to G - d. This, then, is the difference between “the age of six” and “before the age of six”. 19 Another difference between six years of age and before it is clearly apparent. As may clearly be observ ed, the growth of the characteristics is not only in their revelat ion, but in addition, with their growth the emotions become drawn toward s greater and more mature matters. A small child becomes emotional over small and immature thing s, while a more mature person will become emotional about matters of greater significance and importance. As a person matures , he no longer desires the same thin gs he desired during childhood . On the con trary, he may even be embarrassed about what was so important to him as a child . However, it must be noted that this is not due to his emotions and character in and of themselves , but rather, this is because of t he ad ditional radiance of intellect that he now has . This is in contrast to how it is in animals . Because they act completely according to their natures , they cannot chan ge or deviate from them, whatsoever. This is because , as explained above, the natu ral character of the emotions remains constant without change whatsoever . In other words, animals do not mature and grow out of their natural inclinations. In man, however, there are certain changes in the expressions of the nature of his character . When he was a toddler he desired immature things of little value and when he matured his desires changed to matters of greater value . Certainly , this is due to intellect ual growth, which influences and directs the emotions, informing them of what is and is not desir able etc. As known, the intellect acts as a director who guides the emotions on what to become aroused about etc. Thus, alt hough the emotions follow their es sential nature from birth, none the less, their conduct is in accordance to the influence and development of the intellect. However, because at this stage the intellect causes a change mainly only in the expression of the natural characteristics and emo tions (unlike animals who undergo no change at all in this respect ), it is included (by the R ebbe) in the one general level of Mochin D’Yenikah , as well. That is, the emotions still go entirely according to the natural characteristics but their expression is directed by the intellect , to be invested in more mature matters. However, from this sta ge onward another stage of development begins (until nine years of age), in which the emotional arousal is not mere ly influenced and directed by the intellect, but is also caused by it . This is in contr ast to the previous levels in which the intellect mer ely directed the natural character and emotions. This next stage will now be explained. (That is, as will later be explained, although this above level is already said to be greater than the intellect of an animal, it is nevertheless also animalistic in comparison to that which follows it. The main reason for this is because both these levels, both prior to age six, and age six (until age nine) relate to what is good for him . That is, on both levels his natural emotions and desires are all about himself , i.e. his sense and awareness of himself dominates, whereas the intellectual light and arousal which radiates in him and in his emotions is still concealed. In contrast, at nine years of age the arousal and light of the intellect begins to"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" This continues unt il he is nine years of age, at which point he is capable of procreation. 20 At this poi nt he has an a spect of additional growth of his intellect, more than what is necessary for the emotions alone. Moreover, it is now possible for the begin ning of an emotion which comes into being only according to intellec t and reasoning, and if the intell ect dictates the opposite , then an opposite emotion will be born, until his emotions are entirely according to [the dictates of] the intellect. 21       dominate the n atural character and arousal of the emotions, so that the intellect is revealed and dominates, whereas the emotions are sublimated to the intellect, as explained in the introduction to this chapter and as will further be explained.) 20 See Tractate Yevamot 68a . This refers to the legal ruling that at nine years of age a person’s sexual ac ts are considered to be valid, and therefore have legal implications (as in the laws of Yibum - Levirate Marriage etc.) What is meant here by “procreation” is that he is begins to be capable of “ giving birth ” to new emotions on the basis of intellect alone. This is in contrast to the previo us stages in which the intellect mere ly guided and directed the natural character of the emotions. At this stage, however, he begins to be capable of actually bringing for th an emotional arousal caused by the inte llectual reasoning alone. Th is is to say that the natural character of the emotions now begins to become sublimated to the light of the intellect, rather than vice -versa. Prior to this stage the emotional arousal towards action was not directly an arousal into the subject of his contemplation, but only indirectly aroused by it. In contrast, now, his emotions are aroused directly by, and toward, the subject that he contemplates ( and is not just an indirect arousal to act). The reason for this will soon be discussed by the Rebbe. 21 As may be observed, at the physical age of nine a child begins to have a desire to understanding and have different matters explained to him. Until th is point, he may have only recognized and acknowledged these matters as being true, good or even necessary, but did not yet truly understand or appreciate them. Likewise, at nine years of age he is capable of having a degree of grasp and insight into what he is taught. (Because of this the commandment to educate a child in matters of Torah and Mitzvot begins mainly at the age of nine. See Etz Chaim , Shaar 25, Drush 5.) This is because he now desires and is capable of comprehending the explanations given to him and understanding them. Now, this level of “age nine” is comparable to the third level of arousal that results from the Divine service and toil of Hitbonenut contemplation, which is called “Natural Love and Fear” ( Dechilu U’Rechimu Tiveeyim ). Thi s is when immediately , following the arousal in his thoughts, his heart becomes aroused as well. This arousal is consciously felt with much vitality. In other words, the arousal of his thoughts immediately becomes expanded and magnified in his heart. Th is is because, as known, the excitement of the heart is much more expansive and magnified in comparison to the excitement of the mind. This is to say that his heart becomes aroused with the same arousal that took place in the mind, only in a way of greate r feeling. He contemplated and was aroused in his mind by the greatness of G -d, and his heart too now became aroused by the greatness of G -d. The emotions of the heart now directly respond and go according to the emotions of the intellect. No longer is the intellect as greatly concealed as in the previous levels of arousal. This is because in the previous levels, the arousal of the emotions appeared to be completely detached from the intellect, and only indirectly associated with it. For example, when there was an intellectual contemplation of G - d’s greatness, the emotions became aroused and were drawn towards serving G -d through action, and the thoughts of the greatness of G -d became forgotten from his heart. All that remained of his intellectual cont emplation was an impression of the thoughts of his mind within his heart, and even this, only in an indirect and concealed fashion which translated only into action. In contrast, now, he is capable of an arousal of actual love and awe towards G -d Himself. (For this reason, the previous levels of love and awe of G -d are not considered to be actual levels of love and awe of G -d.) "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" In contrast, prior to the age of nine he only had intellect according to the emotions which already were [ins tinctively ] embedded in him, which he can have insight into . 22 This [type of       This, then, is the meaning by the Rebbe’s words that, “ It is now possible for there to begin to be an emotion which is only accor ding to the intellect and reasoning, and when the intellect dictates the opposite then an opposite emotion will be born, until his emo tions are entirely according to the intellect .” Now, although at this stage his emotions are aroused directly from the in tellect, nevertheless, there is still a certain degree of separation between the intellect and the emotions. That is, when the heart becomes excited through his Hitbonenut and his emotions become completely aroused toward G -d, either with great longing, l ove, joy, bitterness, awe or fear etc., the entire length and breadth of the G -dly matter which he was contemplating becomes abbreviated (but not completely concealed) during the actual emotional response. The length and breadth of the contemplation (but not the point), recedes and becomes concealed from consciousness. He is only left with what is called a “ Tamtzit ” (The final essential conclusion), which is the “Therefore” that follows the contemplation (i.e. for example, that G -d is Mighty and Awesome). (The difference between the Tamtzit and the Omek Hamoosag may be understood as follows: There are two types of essence. The “essence of mint” is not its true essence, but is rather what remains after it has been thoroughly processed until only its es sential oil remains. This is the Tamtzit. In the same way, the Tamtzit of a concept is the “Therefore”, which follows the thorough processing of the concept through Hitbonenut - contemplation. In contrast, the true essence of mint is the spiritual source o f the mint itself. This is similar to the Omek Hamoosag – the actual depth of the concept (and the G -dliness vested within it etc) . The Omek Hamoosag is the very depth and source of the concept itself. One who grasps the Omek Hamoosag, which is its very essence and source, has a radically different experience, as will be explained regarding age thirteen and Gadlut Sheni D’Abba – The second maturation from Abba .) Nevertheless, it is understood from the analogy of the mint that just as the “essence of m int” has a tremendous power and strength once it has been processed into an essence, so too, with the Tamtzit (“conclusion”) that has been passed over from his intellect to his heart. It, likewise has an incredible strength to it, and is able to cause a gr eat arousal of his emotions. Nonetheless, at this stage his emotions are still emotions, and there is still a certain separation between the intellect and the emotions (even though, firstly, the emotions are now directly aroused by the intellect, and seco ndly, they are aroused with the same arousal that took place in intellect etc.) Because his arousal is only from the Tamtzit (“conclusion”), to a certain degree the arousal of the emotions is still detached from the intellect. This is because he only g rasps the depth of the concept – Omek HaMoosag (and the G - dliness vested within it) through an external garment (a “ Masach – screen”, which will be explained more thoroughly later). This means that he only grasps the light of Chochmah (and the Infinite Li ght vested within it) through the garment of the letters of the explanations of Binah . It is specifically from the explanations that he is mainly aroused. For this reason this level of arousal is called the “Natural Love and Fear” ( Dechilu U’rechimu Tivi yim ), because the emotional arousal still overpowers the light of the intellectual arousal from which it is born. (In contrast, the next level is called, “Intellectual Love and Fear”, since the light of the intellectual arousal overpowers the emotional ar ousal.) Nevertheless, as the Rebbe will momentarily state, at this stage the light of the intellect already begins to overpower the natural emotions. This being the case, the emotional arousal is already intellectual. In other words it is into the intell ectual subject upon which he contemplated (as opposed to manifesting into something external to it, as in the previous levels), as explained above. 22 As previously explained, prior to the age of nine the intellect radiates and vests within the emotions in a totally concealed manner, in which the natural character of the emotions (and the desire for his personal benefit and wellbeing etc) overpower the intellectual light completely. Because of this, the emotions which are aroused arise in a detached way fr om the light of the intellect (though the intellect is indeed there). That means that the intellect which radiates within the emotions is “overpowered” and “ruled” by the animal -like natural emotions and desires etc. This is not the case, however, in re gard to the subsequent"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"intellect] is also found in wild as well as domesticated animals , that they have insight in their [natural] emotions t o find food and sustenance, except that in man kind [this aspe ct] is called “the animal of the speaker – Chai SheB’Medaber ”. 23 This will suffice those of understanding. From nine years of age and up he is prepared for the second maturation [which is] from Abba . 24 This is to say that [now] it is possible for the inte llect to overpower the emotions , 25 (as explained elsewhere at length regarding the matter of , “From the pinnacles of the boulders etc” 26 ). Because of this he is capable of procreation, since now each sefirah [of the emotions] includes the nine sefirot of Ch aBa”D, ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y . 27 This is because       stage of “age nine”, in which the emotional arousal is focused toward the subject matter and light of the intellect (even though at this stage there still is a degree of separation between the intellect and emotions, as explained abo ve). 23 It was stated previously that at the age of six a person’s ways and actions have a degree of intellec t and reasoning to them and are not merely driven by natural instinctive emotions, like those of an animal. Here, however, it states that the inte llect that he possesses prior to nine years of age is similar to the intellect of an animal . Even animals are capable of insightful wisdom within their natural characteris tics and traits (such as figuring out how to procure food and sustenance etc). The explanation of this seeming discrepancy may be clarified through close scrutiny of the words in the text here. T he Rebbe is exacting in his words here, by saying that even the intellect prior to the age of nine is not completely similar to the intel lect of an animal, but is specifically called “the animal of the speaker – Chai SheB’Medaber ” . This is because there is a similarity between the intellec t of an animal and this level in man; in that (prior to age nine) the arousal of the natural emotions compl etely dominates the radiance of the intellect, and the intellect only serves to direct the natural character of the emotions, as previously explained. (This is comparable to an animal who can find food and shelter etc.) However, t his is in contrast to af ter age nine , in which the light of the intellect begins to dominate over and control the arousal of the emotions and the natural character. Thus, the stages preceding age nine are all considered to be animal -like (albeit the “ani mal of the speaker”) compared to the sta ges which follow age nine, in which the intellect begins to dominate over the emotions. (Similarly , there is a difference between six years of age in relation to the stage of suckling which preceded it. Th is is to say that when there is only the revelation of the natural character and composition of the emotions , it is entirely animal -like . In contrast, when there is a maturation of the character and emotions so that they are directe d by the intellect and are thereby invested into more m ature matters, this is already more than the intellect of an animal ( since an animal is incapable of maturing in this regard ). Nonetheless, this maturation and intellect is sublimated entirely to the nature and character . T he essential nature did not chan ge whatsoever, and in this respect he still is similar to an animal . However, this is specifically, “the ani mal of the speaker” .) This is not the case at nine years of age, in which his emotional arousal comes as a direct result of and exactly according t o that which took place in his intellect and contemplation. 24 That is, the vessels of his emotions are now capable of beginning to be invested with the light of Chochmah (as explained in the introduction). (However, until the age of thirteen, this light of Chochmah is manifested only through the garments of the explanations of Binah . It is only at the next stage of thirteen that the light of Chochmah becomes revealed directly within the heart.) 25 This means that it is now possible for the emotional arou sal to come directly from the intellectual arousal (albeit through the garment of the explanations). This was already explained at length in footnote twenty - one. 26 See Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe), Balak 103d. The explanations give n there are quot ed and explained at length in the introduction of this chapter. 27 Though in a fetus and even in a small child the external vessels ( Kelim ) of all the sefirot ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y are there, nevertheless, because the vessels are “small” they are only capable of containing a diminished radiance of the lights ( Orot ). Therefore, though prior to age nine there only the aspects of ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y are in a revealed state, nonetheless, there indeed is a small measure of intellect ( ChaBa”D ). However , this is only the intellect of the emotions (i.e. ChaBa”D of ChaGa”T or"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"when the aspect of the intellect of ChaBa”D of each emotion is developed , then automatically the aspect of NeHi”Y has the power to give birth to offspring, for the two are interdependent (as was explained at len gth above in chapter twenty six). 28 When he was six       ChaBa”D of NeHi”Y ). Because of this , prior to age nine a person is considered to possess only the general ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y . In contrast, at age nine the development and revelation of th e intellectual sefirot ( ChaBa”D ) in and of themselves begins ( not only that which is necessary for the emotions etc ). 28 As explained in chapter twenty six, in order to bring forth a new soul, it is necessary for there to be an inner unification of Abba and Imma , through the sublimation and pleasure of Arich Anpin and Atik Yomin . This is because for there to be any new influence within the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ) it must come from the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ). Therefore, for there to be an issuance of new influence from the Essence, there must be additional influence of pleasu re and desire, which is what draws out the Essence , as explained in chapter twenty -four. This may be clearly understood from the example of the conception of a new human being in to the world. In order for a child (i.e. a new soul) to be b orn, there must be an inner unification of Abba (Father) and Imma (Mother). Moreover, for the seminal drop to issue forth, the essential self of the person must be invested in it. This is brought out through great pleasure. A further analogy for this was given in chapter twenty -six . That is, it is similar a person who is particularly outstanding in his deep insight and wisdom. Since he knows the concept to its intangible depth, specifically to the very source of its inception, he is therefore capable of bringing out influence and new explanations from it, to someone who is of a m uch lesser intellectual level than himself, even to a small child. This is not so, however, in the case of someone who does not grasp the concept to its very depth. It will be difficult enough for him to thoroughly understand the concept himself, let alone to explain it to someone other than himself who is on a lesser in tellectual level . We therefore find that the ability to bring forth new influence ( NeHi”Y ) is dependant upon and goes according to the power of the intellect ( ChaBa”D ). Since prior to the age of nine a person only has the general sefirot of ChaGa”T and N eHi”Y, he is therefore in capable of “procreation” and “giving birth” to a new influence and revelation, since this is dependant upon the strength of the intellect ( ChaBa”D ). In contrast, when he begins to have a revelation of the intellect of ChaBa”D itse lf ( not just for the emotions) he then begins to be capable of bringing forth new influence and r evelation, i.e. “giving birth”. This ability to “give birth” and bring out new influence is specifically due to the great pleasure involved in grasping the de pth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ). That is, in order for him to have the flash of insight and Chochmah he must be totally invested into the concept, to the point that he arouses the “hidden pleasure” of his soul, as previously explained. Thus, now that he has reached this level of intellectual maturity, he is now capable of bringing forth new explanations etc, from the depth of the concept (which is the source of the length and width, as explained in chapter one.) However, as explained in Etz Chaim ( Sha ar HaKlallim , Chapter 8) at “age nine” he is not yet truly capable of impregnating a female ( Nukvah ). Only later at “age thirteen” is he capable of doing this. That is, because at the age of nine he merely grasped the point of Chochmah as it is already ve sted within the garment of the explanation of Binah , he is not capable of actually drawing forth new explanations or influence from there (since he has not yet grasped the depth itself. As explained in the first several chapters, and in the footnotes abov e, and in chapters twenty -five and twenty -six, in order for new influence to be drawn forth, it is necessary for one to grasp the depth itself.) Thus, at this stage the only “new offspring” and influence he is capable of “giving birth” to, is an emotional arousal which is according to the intellect, for himself . However, he is not yet capable of bringing out new influence or new explanations (in speech) to a recipient other than himself, i.e. a female ( Nukvah ). This second ability to bring forth new infl uence and explanations according to a recipient is only possible when he grasps the very depth itself. This only takes place in the next stages of development, “age thirteen” and “age twenty”, as will be explained shortly."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"years of age each emotion included only ChaGa”T and NeHi”Y and the intellect was very constricted, according to the limitations of the natural instincts of the emotions alone. 29 The second maturation is f rom the age of thirteen until twenty, 30 during which [time] he is capable of selling the [movable ] properties of his father. 31 This is the aspect of Keter and   29 Thus, prior to “age nine” he d id not bring forth new emotions that are into the intellectual matter at all. Rather, his emotional arousal was completely natural ( NeHi”Y ) and emotional ( ChaGa”T ), and only directed by the light of the intellect which was concealed within it. 30 See Shaar ei Teshuvah , Vol.1, p.7a. 31 This is to say that his emotions (which are called “movable properties”) are now completely sublimated to the light of the intellectual arousal. That is, his intellect now completely “rules over” and “dominates” his emotional a rousal. However, this does not mean that the intellect merely overpowers and dictates to the emotions etc, so that they follow the intellect, since this took place prior to this, as explained before. Rather, as explained in the introduction, the intellec t “overpowering” the emotions means that the intellectual arousal and radiance of the intellect overpowers the emotional arousal, so that the emotions are not consciously felt altogether. It is as if the emotional arousal is totally nullified ( Bate l B’Met ziut ) with the intellectual arousal. This is because he now grasps the depth of the concepts ( Omek HaMoosag ) which he contemplates. That is, the light of Chochmah now begins to radiate and vest within the emotions of the heart (as explained in the introd uction). This, then, is the meaning of the ability to “sell”. In other words, he now is capable of “selling” and transferring the “property” of the emotions from one domain to another, i.e. from the domain of emotions to the domain of intellect. Anoth er way of understanding this is that he is now capable of bringing down the light of the intellect from the domain of the intellect to the domain of the emotions, in such a way that the intellect radiates within the emotions just as it radiates within the intellect. (When a sale is made between the seller and the buyer, the property is transferred from one domain to the other. However, the property remains the same.) When a person ’s excitement and arousal is caused by the very depth and essence of the co ncept, which is the Omek Hamoosag , then instead of the intellect receding and becoming “abbreviated ” during the arousal of the emotions (as in the previous levels), on the contrary, it actually expands as a result of the emotions of the heart. The arousal of the emotions does not become separated from the intellect, as in the previous level s, but on the contrary, it actually strengthens the contemplation and is bound up with the comprehension. This is because now his heart itself begins to receive from the light of Chochmah (not through any Masach – screen), as stated, “My heart has seen much wisdom”. This comes about when the very depths of his mind, heart and soul become completely involved and engrossed in the depth of the subject under contemplation, so much so, that his emotional arousal is totally sublimated to the light of the intellectual arousal taking place in his brain . An example of this is that when a person’s entire heart and mind are completely engrossed in a personal or business matter or t he like, his entire being becomes involved and drawn after it. Because of this deep involvement, since his entire mind, heart and soul are involved, the emotions of the heart are not consciously felt and act as an enhancement to the comprehension, rather than a s a distraction. This level is called Mochin D’Gadlut – “Brains of Largeness”. In other words, his mental capacities actually become enhanced as a result of the involvement and excitement of the very depth of his heart. (This is in contrast to the external excitement of the emotions of the prev ious levels. This is an inner excitement and involvement in the very depth of the hea rt. However, this does not mean that the exte rnality of his heart is not excited with great arousal as well. Rather, this is not consciously felt because it is completely absorbed and sublimated to the light of the intellect.) This is the fourth level of Divine service, and is called “Intellectual Love and Fear”. At this stage he is now becomes capable of bringing out novel insights and explanations (which directly result from the sublimation and hidden pleasure, as explained before). However, because he only grasps the depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ) he is only on the level of a Chacham (as explained in chapter"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"ChaBa”D of each emotion. [In other words,] this is the aspect of the [active] persuasion of the d esire of each emotion, from higher than the intellect of that emotion etc. 32 [This stage of development continues] until the age of twenty which is the maturity of the intellect of the emotions in their complet e state. This is because now he knows how to s ell the [immovable ] properties of his father, i.e. with the brains of Abba (Father) which is the source of the emotions, to transfer it from one domain to another etc. 33 For example , this is like       one in regard to the difference between a Navon and a Chacham ). This means that he is only capable of having insight and bringing out influence from the depth of the particular subject which he contemplates. This is because although the Omek HaMoosag is an int angible depth, nevertheless, it is already somewhat limited to this particular subject. (This is not the case with a Navon. He grasps the intangible heyulie and G-dliness of the concept before it is limited at all, as will be explained regarding the next stage of arousal.) This is another reason why he is specifically capable of selling only “movable” properties at this stage. In other words, he is only capable of bringing forth influence from the “moveable” depth of the concept ( Omek HaMoosag ). However, he is not yet capable of bringing forth the “immovable” G -dliness. (See Tractate Bava Basra 155a; 156a. S ee Likkutei Torah BaMidbar 2a . S ee Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Nevi’im U’Ktuvim p.519 . See Kuntres HaHitpaalut (the sections on “intellectual love and fear”) and Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe) Balak , “ Ki M’Rosh Tzurim ”. See Etz Chaim , Shaar 25, Drush 6. Also see part three of The Knowledge of G -d.) 32 This is to say that the nature of the emotions is completely and totally sublimated to the ligh t of the intellectual arousal. The light of the intellectual arousal completely dominates the light of the emotions so that the natural arousal of the emotions is not consciously felt at all. (That is, it does not overpower the intellectual arousal, as i n the previous stages.) (Nonetheless, even at this stage he has not yet transformed the basic nature and character of the emotions themselves. Rather, because of the sublimation of the emotions to the intellect, the emotions ( as emotions) do not have any consciously felt or separate existence whatsoever, but are a vehicle for the light of the intellect. (However they still retain their basic nature.) This is why it is called an active “persuasion” of the desire and intellect of the emotions etc. That is , although the revealed desire ( Keter ) of the emotions is indeed transformed, nonetheless, the (concealed, essential) desire and pleasure for the self has not yet been transformed. (In other words, he is drawn to G -dliness because of the great pleasure he derives from it.) It is for this reason that this stage is called “ Ratzo – Running”. That is, because of his own pleasure in the G-dliness which he grasps (albeit through the Omek HaMoosag ) he is completely drawn toward the light of G-d, level after l evel, to the point that his soul desires to cleave to G -d and literally leave his body. However, in the next stage of age twenty, he grasps the G -dliness itself, before it becomes limited within the “letters” of the Omek HaMoosag . At this stage he achiev es a total and complete sublimation to G-dliness, and becomes literally one with G -d. Because of this, his basic nature itself becomes transformed to conform to the will of G -d. This is the aspect of “ Shuv – Returning”.) 33 Now, the result of t he previous level, as mentioned above, is that one has a great longing and yearning to withdraw from the limitations of his body and the world and to transcend physicality by totally merging with G - dliness. This is called, “ Ratzo – Running towards G - d”, w ith an overpowering urge to totally merge and be consumed by G -dliness. G -d responds to this withdrawal on the part of man below, by withdrawing the Ohr Ein Sof (The Infinite Light) from all levels of the created worlds. (That is, just as in the physical analogy (and the spiritual analogy of the service of G - d) the emotions “ascend” and become included in the intellect and lose all consciously felt existence, so too all the worlds “ascend” and become withdrawn in their source, losing all consciously felt existence.) However, this is contrary to the ultimate intention of G- d’s upper desire, which is that there be a dwelling place for G -d below, in this world. (In other words, instead of the lower worlds ascending and becoming nullified within the Infini te Light of G -d, actually, G- d’s ultimate desire is that the Infinite Light (and Essence of G -d) be revealed below, specifically within the worlds.) For this reason there must be a “ Shoov ” - A Return, after the “ Ratzo ” of running towards G -d. This r eturn comes about in th is next level of Divine service, which is the revelation of the essential G-dliness of the concept itself . Likewise in the soul, this is the revelation of the encompassing light of the Yechidah which is that aspect of the soul as it is completely and totally bound up with G -d. Because it is"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"the changes [he can make] in the combinations of the letters of the intellect, which comes because of the root and source of the depth of the intellect in its essential source, specifically. 34 (This is as previously explained 35 with the analogy of an outstandingly wise individual etc.)       bound up to G - d’s unity (and is thus called Yechidah – Singular), w hen this level of the soul is revealed, the person “shares” the same essential desire ( Keter ) with G -d (since he is to tally bound up with Him). He therefore likewise desires that there be a dwelling place for G -d in this world. G - d responds to the “ Shuv ” (Return) of the Yechidah as well . He causes the Ohr Ein Sof (The Infinite Light) to become invested within all le vels o f the created worlds, revealing G -dliness in all worlds, and thus fulfilling the upper intent and desire in Creation. (This is the opposite result of the previous level in which the person desires to withdraw from his own existence, thus bringing about th e withdrawal of G -dliness from the created worlds.) This is the meaning of the statement in the Mishnah, “Nullify your desire before His desire”. (In contrast, the previous two levels of age nine and age thirteen correspond to the statements of the same Mishnah ( Avot 2:4), “Make your will like His will” (corresponding to the service of “age nine”), “So that He will make your will like His will” (corresponding to the service of “age thirteen”). See Likkutei Torah, Bamidbar 2a.) (This aspect is also hin ted at in the verse (Song of Songs 5:2), “Open to me, my sister, my beloved, my dove, my pure one etc.” All of these various descriptions of love correspond to the various levels and types of emotional arousal of love and awe of G -d mentioned in this chap ter (and at length in Kuntres HaHitpaalut and part three of The Knowledge of G - d). The word used for the last level is “ Tamati ”, the root of which is the word “ Tam ”, and is generally translated as “pure” or “complete”. However, on a deeper level the word “ Tamati ” shares the same root as the word “ Te’umati ”, which means “my twin”. This means that at this stage a person has so bound and unified himself to G -d, to the point that he is called “my twin”. (See Likutei Biurim on Kuntres HaHitpaalut , page 99 an d 100. Also see part three of The Knowledge of G -d) This level is the pure essential desire to fulfill the will of the Master of the Universe, at all times, in a revealed way. In other words, he has transformed his very nature (as a separate entity who feels himself as existing independently from G -d), to reveal his true nature which is literally one with G -d. This is revealed on a constant basis. It is not just in an external encompassing way , but has become his very nature . This, then, is the meanin g of the above statement (in the chapter) that he is now capable of selling the “immovable” properties of his father, transferring them from one domain to another. That is, he is now capable of bringing forth into revelation the essential unlimited G -dlin ess itself. (For example, although the previous level of Zeir Anpin is the source of miracles which occur within the nature of the world, this level of Zeir Anpin is the source of miracles, which, though they occur in our world, nonetheless, completely transcend the nature of the world.) 34 In other words, because he grasps the intangible and unlimited G -dliness of the concept, as it is even before it is limited in the Omek HaMoosag (which, in comparison, is limited and tangible), he is therefore capable o f bringing out novel insights and explanations in an infinite manner, not only in relation to the subject matter being contemplated. This is similar to the level of a Navon (explained in chapters one and two) who is capable of grasping “one thing from ano ther”. That is, from “one thing” which are the revealed explanations, which are tangible in the way of a “something”, he grasps “another thing” which is the G -dliness itself. Because this G -dliness is an unlimited Heyulie , he is capable of bringing it ou t and manifesting it in any manner. Moreover, as explained in chapter twenty six, the higher he grasps, the lower he is capable of bringing it. (Because of this a Tzaddik (righteous person) who is totally bound to G -dliness at the “Original Source”, is li terally capable of bringing down G -dliness into the physical world in the form of miracles (i.e. “changing the letters” and nature of the physical realm.) (This is also the meaning of the statement ( Hayom Yom, 3 Tishrei ) regarding the verse, “And you sh all return ( Teshuvah ) until Hashem your G -d ( Ad Havayah Elokecha )”. That is, one must toil and cleave in revealing G -dliness to the point that his nature is changed so that the unlimited Essence of G -d, Havayah , is for him Elokim (which has the same numer ical value as HaTeva – Nature). That is, he makes G - d’s"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" This, then, is the aspect of “ Yisrael – ישראל ”, [whose letters spell] “ Li Rosh – לי ראש ”, 36 meaning “A head” and intellect “for me”, which are the aspects of Keter , Chochmah, Binah and Da’at .

This is analogous to a very wise individual, that the more he knows the [subject] to the depth of the matter at its first source, the more he knows how to clarify and refine it, to remove the errors etc. Likewise, his wisdom will stand by him so that he can support himself with his profession and profit from his work. This is called, 39 “His Torah learning is his profession”. 40 This, then, is the [explanation of] the matter of “It is the nature of man to       unlimited reality ( Havayah ) into his reality by cleaving and binding himself to G -d through his Divine service.”) 35 See chapter twenty six. See also footnote 28 of this chapter. 36 See Pri Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaLulav ) Shaar 29, Chapter 1. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Vayikra , Vol.1, p.75, and Shaarei Teshuvah 94d. 37 In other words, the refinement of the natural emotions is commensurate to the revelation of the light of the intellect. This is to say that according to the revelation of the sublimation of the Koach Ma”H (the power of “what”, as in “what are we”, as previously explained) of Chochmah, will be the degree of the sublimation of the natural (animalistic) emotions to the intellect. This, then, is the meaning of Ma”H (which has a numerical of 45, the numerical value of Adam – Man – אדם ) clarifies and refines Ba”N (which has a numerical value of 52, the numerical value of Behemah – Animal – בהמה ). See also the various footnotes in the beginning of this chapter. (See also Torat Chaim, VaYetze 166a, footnote 9. Also see Shaarei Teshu vah , Vol.1, p.48c. ) 38 See Zohar ( Raayah Mehemna ) Tzav 28a; 34a. 39 See Tractate Shabbat 11a. Also see Torat Chaim, Bereshit 2c. ( Also see Etz Chaim, Shaar HaKlallim , chapter 8.) 40 In the physical analogy, a person’s ability to apply abstract knowledge to physical reality is commensurate to the depth of his comprehension of the subject matter. Similarly, in the spiritual analogue, it is specifically commensurate to a person’s depth of comprehension of G -dliness that he will be capable of bringing it out an d manifesting it in the physical world, in refining himself and the world around him. Now, just as this is so in regard to man’s service of G -d below, it is likewise so in regard to Zeir Anpin of Atzilut above (who is called the “Upper Man”). Commensurat e to the revelation of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ) within Zeir Anpin of Atzilut, will be the influence of this light below in Malchut (which is Ba”N, i.e. the speech which creates the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah ). This, then, is what is meant by the statement, “his Torah learning is his profession”. That is, the entire purpose is to refine the world so that it reveals G - dliness (as opposed to “overpowering” and “dominating” the G -dliness and thereby concealing G- dliness). That is, the world was created in such a manner that the “nature” of the world “overpowers” the G -dliness of the world, and G -dliness is concealed. Because of this, the world appears to exist independent of its maker and is conducted accordin g to the laws of nature. The entire purpose of man, however, is to clarify and refine the world, in the manner explained above, so that it is becomes a fitting receptacle and vessel for the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) to be reveale d within it. This is accomplished specifically through toil in Torah and Mitzvot (the commandments of G -d). Even more specifically, it is through the investment in Hitbonenut particularly in the levels of the Torah called Kabbalah and Chassidut . This i s called “work” (like the six days of work, which correspond to the six millennia of refinement ( Avodat HaBirurim ). In the Zohar this is called , “ Pulchana D’Rechimuta –A Labor of Love”. It is called “Labor” because the arousal of th ese levels (until one achieves a state of Gadlut HaMochin ) requires great toil and labor. This is in contrast to the ease in which the heart is aroused to wards natural and worldly"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"conquer etc”, which is the aspect of the name of Ma”H – 45 ( מ \" ה ) of Chochmah which refines [the name of] Ba”N – 52 ( ב \" ן ) etc, and this is the meaning of “You have ruled over Elokim ”. 41 This will suffice those of understanding. End of Chapter Thirty Four       matters. When it comes to natural matters of the world , as soon as a desire enters one’s mind , he becomes aroused and his heart is immediately affected and arous ed with great yearning and a flaming desire. The opposite is also true. When something negative causes the mind to become embittered, the heart too, responds immediately with great bitternes s and disdain against it. However, in regard to the service of G -d, this is not the case . In matters of G -dliness, the heart is not easily moved by the arousal of the mind. This is because (until the state of Gadlut HaMochin ) the G -dliness in the compreh ension of his mind does not permeate his very being, since it is revealed only in an encompassing manner. Therefore, he does not grasp the actual G -dliness itself. If this is the case in respect to the actual letters of comprehension in the mind, then ce rtainly the revelation to the heart is even more miniscule. It therefore requires great contemplative toil and labor, to bring the G -dly light itself into the letters of his comprehension. When this is accomplished, his heart au tomatically and spontaneou sly ignites as well, in the manner explained above. This service is therefore called “Labor” since it requires great toil and labor. Another reason it is called “ Avodah – Work”, is from the terminology “ Orot Avudim – Worked hides”. Hides are “worked” to soften and make them fit for use. Likewise, the toil of Hitbonenut constitutes the matter of “working” on the character traits of the animal soul and redirecting them to G -d, instead of toward worldly desires. This is specifically accomplished through a r evelation of the light of Chochmah within the emotions, which is caused only through Hitbonenut - contemplation. However, when the “work” is complete there will be a complete revelation of the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) within the worlds. This will take place (in a complete way) in the “World to Come” ( Olam HaBah ), which is known as Shabbat – the day of rest. 41 According to all that has been explained in the introduction to this chapter and in the chapter itself, this statement i s self understood. (It is worthy to note, however, that the five general levels described in this chapter correspond to the five levels of the soul, Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah and Yechidah . Just as man below is affected differently according to the revelation of these various levels (which is according to his toil), so likewise Zeir Anpin of Atzilut also has these five levels, and is conducted differently according to the revelation of these levels. Thus, the entire Hishtalshelut (Chaining down) of the worlds is dependant upon the revelation of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ) within Zeir Anpin . This, in turn, depends on man’s toil in the service of G -d below. (For further elucidation on the five levels of arousal and how they relate to the five lev els of the soul, see Kuntres Hahitpaalut , the explanations (of Kuntres Hitpaalut ) from Rabbi Hillel of Paritch, and The Knowledge of G -d, part three.)"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A.

In addition, [we must also understand] the unification of Yaakov and Rachel which is the unification of the emotions with speech. 4   1 See Pri Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaKriyat Shma ) Shaar 8, Chapter 9. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee , Hanachot 5577, page 271. 2 See Zohar, Lech Lecha 94a; Tzav 30b and 31a; Acharei 65a. Also see chapter twenty -six above , i.e. the exp lanation of the words “ E-l Elyon – The Supernal G - d”. (This is the quote from chapter twenty -six: “The “Supernal G - d” ( E-l Elyon ) refers to the ascent of the inner light of Abba (Insight) as it receives from the Mazal of “ Notzer ”.) That is, it refers to the sublimation of Chochmah (i.e. the Koach Ma”H ) as it receives its light from the aspect of Keter in the inner unification of Abba and Imma, as explained there at length. 3 As explained previously, the aspect of the Koach Ma”H (Power of “What”) of Choch mah is the aspect of the sublimation and hidden pleasure of the power of Chochmah to the aspect of Keter, from which it receives its light and influence. Moreover, as explained in the previous chapter, it is specifically this revelation and sublimation wh ich causes the intellect to rule over the natural aspect of the emotions. This was referred to as the aspect of Ma”H (which has a numerical value of Adam – Man (45) – אדם ) ruling over the aspect of Ba”N (which has a numerical value of Behemah – Animal (52) – בהמה ), and represents the distinction between man and animal. It is also the difference between the aspect of the immaturity of the intellect ( Katnoot HaMochin ), w herein the intellect is “ruled” and concealed by the natural emotional arousal, compared to the aspect of the maturity of the intellect ( Gadloot HaMochin ), in which the intellect “rules” and dominates the nature and the emotional arousal. These two genera l states were referred to as Yaakov and Yisrael (as will be further elaborated in this chapter). Thus, this is the deeper meaning of the Torah verses which explain how the name Yaakov ( יעקב ) was changed to Yisrael ( ישראל ), as explained previously at length. (Another aspect in the name Yaakov – יעקב which was not previously mentioned is that the word Yaakov ( יעקב ) spells Yod – Eikev ( י ' עקב ). As mentioned before, the letter Yod ( י ) refe rs to the point of Chochmah . The word Eikev ( עקב ) means “heel”, i.e. the lowest aspect of the “body”. Thus, the name Yaakov ( יעקב ) indicates how the intellect and light of Chochmah is dominated by the aspect of the “heel” and the most external nature etc .)

Both aspects mentioned in this paragraph refer to different types of unification s of Zeir Anpin and Nukvah . This wil l be discussed and explained in much greater detail in later chapters. ( Also s ee the Siddur"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" [However, ] we must first understand the difference between Yisrael and Yaakov . This is because the aspect of Yaakov is the aspect of Tiferet of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut , which is the attribute of Mercy. 5 As is kno wn, the fo refathers are “the chariot” [of the supernal attributes]. 6 Avraham is in the aspect of Chessed – Kindness 7 of Zeir Anpin , Yitzchak is in the aspect of Gevurah - Judgment, 8 and Yaakov is the aspect of Tiferet – Mercy. Likewise, it is written, 9 “ Give truth to Yaakov ; Kindness to Avraham etc”. Moreover, regarding the [verse, 10 ] “ And y ou shall give me a sign ( Ot ) of truth”, it states in the Zohar , 11 “This is the letter ( Ot ) Vav ( ו )”. 12 This is the aspect of Yaakov who is the middle line, “the middle beam ... [which passes through from one end to the other ” ]. 13       (of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi) Shacharit 60c. See also Etz Chaim ( Shaar Ozen Chotem Peh ) Shaar 4, Chapter 1. See also Siddur (60c). See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee , Vayikrah, Vol. 1, pg. 227.) 5 It was explained in chapter 21 that the attribute of Tiferet is the quality which mediates between the heartfelt emotion of Chessed and the heartfelt emotion of Gevurah . It was explained there that this is the qua lity of Mercy ( Rachamim ), which can only take place subsequent to the quality of judgment. That is, although he is found guilty, he is released through mercy. As explained towards the end of the chapter there (and also in chapter 15 etc.), the reason thi s intermediate quality has this power is only because it is a quality of the middle line which reaches up, all the way to the essence of the desire and pleasure, which is higher than division and includes all these opposites as one. It is because of this that it is capable of synthesizing the expression of these opposing qualities etc. This concept was explained before at length. (See chapter 21, and footnotes 20 and 21 there. Also see Zohar Lech Lecha 87b, Zohar ( Sitrey Torah ) Vayetze 157b, and Vol. 3, 302a. See also Pardes Rimonim ( Shaar Erchei HaKinuyim ) Shaar 23, section on “ Rachamim ” and “ Tiferet ” .) 6 All of the actions of the forefathers were completely given over to G -d, with all their being, so that they were, literally, the vehicles for the exp ression of His Divine will within the world. Our forefather Avraham, personified and was the “chariot” and vehicle for the attribute of Kindness ( Chessed ) and Love of G - d, as expressed by the verse, (Isaiah 41:9) “ But you, Yisrael, are my servant, Yaakov whom I have chosen, the seed of Avraham who loves me .” In contrast, Yitzchak personified and was the “chariot” and vehicle for the attribute of Judgment ( Gevurah ) and Fear of G -d, as expressed by the verse, (Genesis 31:42) “ Were it not that the G -d of my father, the G -d of Avraham, and the fear of Yitzchak etc. ” Yaakov, however, represents the median quality of Tiferet and Mercy, which is the quality of truth, as expressed by the verse, (Micha 7:20) “ Give truth to Yaakov, kindness to Avraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old. ” (Also, the numerical value of “ Yaakov Yaakov – יעקב יעקב ” (mentioned in Genesis 46:2) is 364, which is the same numerical value as the words “ Rachamim B’Din – Mercy in Judgment” ( רחמים בדין ), thus representing the intermediate conduct between Kindness ( Chessed ) and Judgment ( Gevurah ).) (Also see Beres hit Rabba, Parsha 47 and Parsha 82. See also Torat Chaim Noach 49d, and footnote 42 there. ) 7 See Zohar Bereshit 47b. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee , Kuntreisim , pg. 4. 8 See Pardes Rimonim ( Shaar Erchei HaKinuyim ) Shaar 24, Chapter 3 (section on Gev urah ). 9 Micha 7:20 10 Joshua 2:12 11 See Zohar Vayikra 2a. See also Sefer HaMaamarim 5565, Vol. 1, pg. 368. 12 The Hebrew word for “sign” is “ Ot ” ( אות ) which is the same word for “letter – Ot אות ( ” ). Thus, the Zohar ( Vayikra 2a) reads the verse mentioned above as, “You shall give me a letter of truth,” and states that this refers to the letter Vav ( ו ). In other words, specifically t he letter Vav ( ו ) is called “T he Letter of Truth ”. However, this does not mean that the other letters are not “True ”, but rather that this letter is specifically called , “ The Letter of Truth ( Ot Emet )”. The reason for this is becaus e (as mentioned previously) the letter Vav ( ו ) refers to the aspect of (the middle line of the emotional qualities of) Zeir Anpin , which is called Yaakov , about whom it states, “Give truth to Yaakov ”. A lso, a s explained in chapter fifteen, the letter Vav ( ו ) represents the aspect of the intermediat e conduct of the Kav (Line) which is a synthesis of the qualit ies of revelation and concealment , i.e. Chessed and Gevurah , and includes them both. As explained there, the reason it is capable of inter -including these two opposite powers, though they natur ally negate each other, is because the middle line (the aspect of the Vav – ו ) reaches all the way to the very Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ) and contains a radiance of the Essence of the"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" As is known, the explanation of the matter is that the right line [which consists] of Chochmah, Chessed and Netzach , is negate d by the left line [which consists] of Binah, Gevurah and Hod . 14 For example, this is similar to how t he attribute of judgment negates the attribute of kindness and limits its light. Likewise, the opposite [is true], that kindness limits the light of judg ment. We therefore find that both may cease. Th is can not be called “Truth – Emet ” , 15 since the principle [definition] of truth is that it endures [forever] , as stated, 16 “The lip of truth will be established forever; but a lying tongue is but for a moment .” [In contrast,] falsehood is deceit ( Kazav – כזב ), as in the terminology, 17 “[A spring of water] whose waters fail” ( Y’ Kazv oo Meimav – כזב ו מימיו י ). 18 As known, [under such conditions] the river [which is drawn from the waters of the spring] will cease. Ho wever, the quality of Emet - Truth, is that it endure s [forever]. This is because it includes the two opposites of Chessed and Gevurah [within itself] . [Therefore ,] nothing at all obstructs it or opposes it. Because of this, “its waters do not fail.” This, then, is [the meaning of the statement in the Zohar that] “the letter of truth is the letter Vav ( ו )” , which is the middle line that includes both Chessed - Kindness and Gevurah – Judgment. This [middle line] is Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod (as stated previously in chapter twenty one). 19       Infinite Light within it, which is the ultimate Truth. That is, it is “the inner beam... which passes through from one end t o the other end.” It is for this reason that the Sages stated that, “The seal of the Holy One blessed is He, is Truth – Emet ( אמת ) (See Tractate Shabbat 55a). Th e various aspect s of the quality of “Truth” ( אמת ) wil l become further understood through the explanations in this chapter. 13 Exodus 26:28. See also Zohar Terumah 175b. This concept , that Yaakov refers to the “middle line” ( Kav HaEmtza’ee ) is also learned from the verse (Genesis 25:27) “And the boys grew: and Esav was a cunning hunter, a man of t he field; while Yaakov was a pure man ( Ish Tam ), dwelling in tents.” It is explained that the word “tents - Ohalim ” is plural and teaches us that the aspect of Yaakov ( Tiferet ) dwells between the tent of Avraham ( Chessed ) and the tent of Yitzchak ( Gevurah ). (According to the Zohar, t he words “ Ish Tam ” which often are translated as “a simple man” are translated as “a complete (or pure) man”.) (See Zohar Vol. 1, 146a. ) 14 This was already explained chapter 21 at length . 15 That is, these two qualities are di ametric opposites which therefore cancel each other out and become “negated ”. This is the opposite of truth, the main character of which is that it has a “true” and positive value and endures forever . 16 Proverbs 12:19 17 Using the terminology of Isaiah 5 8:11 18 That is, the stream that flows from the spring dries up (either because it became separated from the spring or because the waters of the spring stopped flowing) and is therefore called “ Y’Kazvoo Meimav – Its waters fail ”. The term used in this vers e “ Y’Kazvoo – Fail” ( יכזבו ) shares the same three letter root as the word for deceit or falsehood “ Kazav כזב ( ” ). This teaches us that something which is fals e will ultimately fail, and will not endure. In contrast, the aspect of truth endures and “is established forever”. 19 This is to sa y that although the two opposing lines, i.e. the right line of Kindnesses and the left line of Judgments, nullify and cancel each other out, the middle line, wherein there is a synthesis of these two opposites, never cease s whatsoever. Rather , because it is a composite of both the aspect of kindness and the aspect of judgment , it its elf does not cease. Thus, specifically the middle line, the aspect of Tiferet , which is represented by the letter Vav ( ו ), is called the aspect of “T ruth”. (As explained before in regard to the letter Vav ( ו) of the word “ VeHanora – The Awesome” ( ו הנורא ); it is specifically the letter Vav ( ו ) which represents the middle line. (See Chapter 15 footnote 16, and Chapter 21 f ootnote 3.) (This can also be understood through the difference between the essential qualities of Tohu (Chaos), in comparison to the qualities of Tikkun (Rectification). As previously explained, the qualities of Tohu are the essential qualities that do not inter -include their opposites (because they are essential points rather than lines , like the Vav – ו ). Thus, regarding each of these qualities the verses (Gen. 36) state, “And he reigned... and he died” etc. That is, the quality of Kindness ( Chessed ) is incapable of coexisting with the quality of Judgment"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" Now, there is another benefit in the middle line of DaTi”Y 20 in that it does no t [undergo] change from beginning to end. 21 Just as it is in the beg inning, so is it in the end. It does not undergo change as a result of the length of being drawing down . This is because of the connection [and unity] that there is in its entir ety, [so that] from beg inning to end it is unified as a single entity. [In this way] i t is like “the inner beam ...which passes through” 22 from the highest end to the lowest end. This is not the case, however, with the other two lines. [That is,] in the rig ht and left [lines] there is no aspect of a connection and bond of each [of the sefirot with the other Sefirot of that line]. As a result of this, we do not find that their end is similar to their beginning. 23       ( Gevurah ) and vice versa, etc. This is not the case with the qualities of Tikkun, in which there is a true inter -inclusion of all the qualities and sefirot . As mentioned before (Ch. 20) the aspect of the rectification and inter -inclusion of Tikkun comes about specifically by means of the radiance of t he name of Ma”H (45), which refers to the revelation of the light of Keter and Chochmah within the emotions. In other words, this is the same matter as the light of the intellect “ruling over” and dominating the natural character of the emotions and the i rrational emotional arousal etc. That is, this is the concept of the aspect of Ma”H (i.e. Man - אדם ) which clarifies and rectifies the aspect of Ba”N (i.e. Animal - בהמה ).) (Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5708, pg. 182, Ch. 2 and on.) 20 This is an acronym for the three sefirot of the middle line, Da’at, Tiferet, and Yesod . 21 N ot only is the aspect of the middle line eternal and endur ing, but it is also unchanging. As it is in its beginning, so it is in its end. This will now be further explained. 22 As previo usly explained (chapter 21, footnote 28), the middle line is called the “Inner Beam - Breeyach HaTichon ”. This refers to the construction of the Tabernacle ( Mishkan ) which was a portable Temple used by the Jewish People during the forty year sojourn in th e desert until the building of Mishkan Shiloh. Its walls were constructed of cedar beams which stood side by side and were held together by a long beam, the “ Breeyach HaTichon – Inner Beam” ( Ex . 26:28 ; 36:33 ) which ran inside all the beams, connecting the m together. Everything in the construction of the Tabernacle (and the Holy Temple in Jerusalem) corresponded to something in the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ). This inner beam corresponds to the middle line of Da’at , Tiferet, Yesod whi ch connects all the other sefirot together. All the sefirot of the middle line actually represent the same aspect, that of a “connection” between the influencer and recipient. Keter represents the connection of the desire to the object of the desire, Da’ at is the intellectual connection of the mind, Tiferet is the heartfelt connection, and Yesod is the actual or gut connection between the influencer and the recipient. Furthermore, all the sefirot of the middle line are literally bound up with each other, as a single entity. For example, regarding the physical connection between Adam and Chava it states, “And Adam knew ( Yada ) Eve”. This knowledge ( Da’at ) does not merely refer to an intellectual connection, for the verse tells us that through this “knowle dge” they gave birth to a child. Rather, the Zohar states that the sefirah of Yesod corresponds to the male reproductive organ, (whereas Malchut corresponds to the female recipient of the seminal drop of life force – which comes from the essence of the in fluencer, as previously explained). As will soon be mentioned, the Talmud states, “A man is incapable of having an erection without Da’at (i.e. without mental interest and focus). Rather, the verse mentioned above about Adam and Chava teaches us that the sefirot of the middle line are literally bound up with each other, as one. This is to say that the erection ( Yesod ) occurs simultaneous to the arousal of desire ( Keter ), the mental interest and focus ( Da’at ) and the heartfelt emotional connection ( Tiferet ). They act, literally, as one – and there is no change or diminishment whatsoever. As it is in its beginning, so it is in its end. This is the aspect of Truth. (For example, a “truthful” and “honest” person is one whose external expressions are a refle ction of his inner self.) 23 In chapter twenty one it was explained that although Chessed – Kindness is an offshoot of Chochmah – Insight, nonetheless, Chessed is an entirely different matter than Chochmah . Likewise, Netzach – Conquest is an offshoot of Chessed – Kindness, but is nonetheless an entirely different matter, which is separate from Chessed . That is, the end is not at all similar to the beginning. This is likewise the case in the left line of Binah, Gevurah and Hod , as explained there."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"An example of this is [the right line of] ChaC ha”N . 24 W e find that in Netzach (Conquest) there is a [qualitativ e] diminishment of the light of the influence [of Chessed – Kindness]. This is likewise the case in [ regard to the sefirah of] Hod (Splendor). A s is known in [regard to] the [explanation of] the matter of Netzach and Hod ’, they are called , “T he two branches of the Willow ( Aravot ) , which lack flavor and scent ”. 25 Thi s is because th e radiance of the intellect ceases in them, since Chessed (Kindness) is mere ly a branch of Chochmah (Wisdom) 26 and t he principle intellect and reasoning of the kindness has already withdrawn and passed. [The intellect] only remains in [the kindness] in a way of Tzimtzum - lessening and concealment. Although it still possesses [the intellect] within itself in a conceal ed manner, 27 there is nonetheless a separation from [the intellect], and there is no t such a great connection and bo nd between them. 28 For example, [it states, 29 ] “ Chessed is the right arm”, i.e. [this refers to] the strength of the right arm which is separa te from t he brain etc. [L ikewise,] t he aspect of Netzach , which is mere ly the victory of the commitment, is already more separate from the brains of Chochmah , since all that remains within it is a faint impression of th e love and kindness [of the heartfel t emotions] . This is similar to the “right thigh” , which is separate from the kindness of the “right arm”, for there is no [direct] bo nd between the thigh and the hand. The same is true of the “left hand” and the “left thigh” which are the aspects of the left line of BoGa”H . 30 The [ sefirot of the left line] are separated one from the other. Therefore, we will not find their beginning in their end. This is because of the cessation of the intellectual radiance, so that there can be a complete [qualitative ] lessening [and diminishment], as in the   24 This is an acronym for the three sefirot of the right line, Chochmah , Chessed , and Netzach . 25 In the Midrash ( Vayikra Rabba , Parsha 30) we learn regarding the four species used on the holiday of Sukkot (the Lulav – Palm Branch , Etrog – Citron , Hadasim – Myrtle and Aravot - Willow) that each of them differs in quality from the other . The Etrog (Citro n) has both a flavor and a scent , the Lulav (Palm Branch) has flavor but no scent , the Hadas (Myrtle) has a scent but no flavor, and the Aravot (Willow) has no flavo r or scent. In the Zohar we learn that the two Aravot (Willow Branches) which are used in the four species, which have neither flavor nor scent , represent the aspects of Netzach and Hod . It is explained that the reason for this is because the aspects of Netzach and Hod are separate from the aspect of the essential emotions of the heart (which are ChaGa”T ), and it is because of this that they do not have the “flavor” nor the “scent” of the intellectual light which vests within the emotions. Rather, all th at radiates within the qualities of Netzach and Hod is the aspect of an impression. For example, in the commitment to act out a kindness , there is no emotional arousal of the heart etc. It is even possible that at the moment , he does not feel particularl y kindly t oward the recipient. However, he forces himself to act in a kind manner because of his commitment to doing so (which are the aspects of Netzach and Hod ). That is , there is no “flavor” or “scent ”, but rather, only the commitment wh ich is impresse d within him through his intellect and emotions. (However, it is nonetheless a “branch” of Chessed , because if he did not have the original light of kindness impressed upon his heart , he would not have the commitment to act in a kindly manner etc. Nevert heless, as explained in the footnotes of the previous chapter, the conduct which comes from the aspect of Netzach and Hod is only the aspect of a “cold thought”, which is devoid of “flavor” and “scent ” , i.e. vitality .) (See Zohar VaYechi 220b, (and the Mi kdash Melech there), and also see Zohar Balak 193b. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee , Bamidbar , Vol. 5, pg. 1,868. See also Shaar HaEmunah 101b.) 26 See Chapter 21. 27 See Shaarei Teshuvah 114b and on. See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee , Bamidbar , Vol 5 , pg. 1,867 and on; and Nevi’im Uketuvim pg. 179. 28 This was all explained at length in the previous chapter, with the explanation of how with the “birth” of the heartfelt emotions of Chessed and Gevurah, the light of the intellect and reasoning is withdra wn. 29 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a. 30 This is an acronym for the three sefirot of the left line, Binah, Gevurah and Hod ."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"verse, 31 “And the hollow of Yaakov ’s thigh was strained”. This is to say that he hit him in the aspect of Netzach , “in the sinew of the thigh - vein”, 32 to the point that the external [forces of impurity] receive [ the ir sustenance] from there. 33 This is i n accordance with the statement in Zohar regarding the thigh of a Sota . 34 This also is the reason why regarding Chessed and Gevurah themselves it states, 35 “ Yishmael came out of Avraham ”’ , for he is the excess and dregs   31 Genesis 32:26 . This refers to the incident in which Yaakov fought with the angel of Esav (See commentary of Rashi there). “ And Yaakov was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day: And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Yaakov’s thigh was put out of joint, as he wrestled w ith him... Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew of the vein, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Yaakov’s thigh in the sinew of the vein.” This will be further explained momentarily. 32 Genesi s 32:33 33 Now, we can ask a question here regarding the words of the Rebbe. We previously stated that Yaakov is the aspect of the middle line of DaTi”Y which is the aspect of Truth. How then can it be that the angel of Esav and the forces of evil were ca pable of overpowering the aspect of Yaakov and receive sustenance from his “thigh”? The answer to this question may be understood in light of what was previously explained. The aspect of Yaakov represents the aspect of the immaturity of Zeir Anpin ( Katno ot HaMochin ), wherein the light of the intellect of Chochmah (the Yod - י) is in its most “immature” and concealed state, and is thus overpowered by the external arousal of the natural emotions of Chessed and Gevurah . That is, with the arousal of the emot ions there is a withdrawal of the light of the intellect and the revelation of truth. Even more than this, it is possible that the light of Chochmah and truth ( Ma”H ) becomes completely concealed by the aspect of the natural character and emotions ( Ba”N ), in a manner of the “cold thought” mentioned before (i.e. the external aspects of Netzach and Hod ). Thus, because there is a concealment of the aspect of Chochmah and the intellectual light of the “head”, it is therefore possible for the external forces to overpower the aspect of Yaakov to a certain extent, and “hit him in the sinew of the thigh - vein”, i.e. Netzach . However, this is not the case with the aspect of Yisrael ( ישראל ), which spells “ Li Rosh – A Head [and Intellect] for Me” ( לי ראש ). For, Yisra el is the aspect of the revelation of the light of the intellect and truth within the emotions, in which the emotions and external forces that conceal, are automatically illuminated and thus “ruled” by the light of truth. (This is also the reason why Yaak ov ’s limp and thigh was healed when the light of “the sun shone upon him”, as Rashi points out in his commentary to Gen. 32:32.) The distinction between the aspects of Yaakov and Yisrael will be further explained at the end of this chapter. 34 Regarding the verses, (Genesis 32:26) “And Yaakov was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him etc.” and, “He saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh , ” the Zohar ( Mishpatim 111b ) explains that the Sitra Achara (the side of evil) persevered over the thigh , i.e. Netzach , of Yaakov , and “won” it from him . Th e Zohar then continues to explain that the aspect of the “ thigh ” (i.e. Netzach ) of the aspect of Yaakov was weakened until the Prophet Shmuel came and rectified it . (It explain s there that its weakness was that it did not draw down the light of prophecy. As is explained elsewhere, prophecy is primarily revealed through the aspects of Netzach and Hod . However, this is not the place to elaborate on this point.) From the time of Shmuel onward the Sitra Achara does not have dominion over the aspect of the thigh of Yaakov . Rather, the forces of evil and concealment now receive their sustenance from another “thigh”, the thigh of the adulteress ( Sota ). As scripture states regarding the adulteress - Sotah (Numbers 5:22), “These waters that cause curse shall enter your innards to distend the stomach and cause the thigh to fall” . The reason for this is because the “ Sitra Achara ” itself is compared to an adulteress, as stated regarding the side of evil, “Who for sakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her G - d ” (Proverbs 2:17). (See Zohar Mishpatim 111b. Also see Numbers 5:21, 27. ) 35 See Tractate Pesachim 56a. The Talmud relates: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Scriptu re states, “Then Yaakov called for his sons and said, ‘gather together and I shall tell you what will befall you in the End of Days.’” Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the end of the withdrawal of G - d’s right hand (i.e. the time of the Messianic Era), but the Divine Presence departed from him and he was unable to do so. He said to his sons, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid, there is a blemish among my children, like Avraham from whom there issued Yishmael, or like my father Yitzchak from whom issued Esav. His sons answered him, “Hear O Israel, Hashem is our G - d, Hashem is One”. They then explained, “Just as there is only One in your heart,"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"of the Kindnesses ( Chassadim ). [It likewise states,] “ Esav came out of Yitzchak ” [referring to] the excess and dregs of the Judgments ( Gevurot ). 36 However, Yaakov is the aspect of the middle line of DaTi”Y , 37 In this line there is a connection and bond be tween its beginning to its end , so much so that its end is found to be the same as its beginni ng, literally. (For example, as is known , it is impossible for an erection to occur without Da’at (concentration and interest) which [takes place] in the head. 38 We ,       so there is only One in our heart. That is, Yaakov feared that perhaps the Divine Presence had departed from him because one of his children did not believe in G - d’s absolute unity, and therefore was not worthy of receiving this prophecy. Through their answer Yaakov now knew that he was prevented from revealing the time of Moshiach’s arrival not because his sons were unwort hy, but for other reasons known to G -d alone. In any event, it is understood that from Avraham who was the “chariot” and vehicle for the Divine attribute of Chessed, there nonetheless came forth the wicked Yishmael . From Yitzchak who was the “chariot” an d vehicle for the Divine attribute of Gevurah there nonetheless came forth the wicked Esav . In contrast, all of the sons of Yaakov , who was the “chariot” and vehicle for the attribute of Tiferet ( Rachamim – Mercy), were righteous. It is for this reason t hat it states regarding Yaakov that “his bed was complete”. This again demonstrates that in the right and left lines ( ChaCha”N and BoGa”H ) it is possible for there to be a diminishment and concealment of the light of the intellect of Keter and Chochmah , t o the point that there may be a complete concealment of the aspect of Truth. The result is that there is a sense of independent existence, separate and apart from G -d. This sense of seperation is the source of all vitality and influence to all the externa l forces of evil, G -d forbid. Such is not the case, however, with the middle line of DaTi”Y . (See Etz Chaim, Shaar 31, Chapter 2.) (The explanations of the external forces and shells of evil – “ Sitra Achara ” and “ Kelipot ” – will be explained at greater length towards the end of the book, with the help of G -d.) 36 From all of the above we may also understand the statement of the Sages that the external forces derive their sustenance from the nails (which are the “end” and conclusion of the right and left “hands”), and why a person who cuts his nails is obligated to wash his hands ( Netilat Yadayim ). We also may understand the reason why when a person awakens in the morning , an evil spirit dwells specifically upon his hands , until he washes them in the pres cribed manner ( Netilat Yadayim ). Similarly, we may understand the statement that, “A lie has no legs” of its own, but rather derives its su stenance from the aspects of Netzach and Hod , which are (the legs) of holiness. (For example, for a lie to be belie ved, it must always contain a certain degree of truth in it.) We may also understand why in the war against Amalek , when Moshe would lift his hands the Jews would dominate, but when he would lower his hands , Amalek would dominate. This is because when he lifted his hands ( Chessed and Gevurah ) next to his head ( ChaBa”D ), the external forces of evil (which derive their sustenance from holiness) could not derive influence from ther e. In contrast, when he lowered his hands ( Chessed and Gevurah ) they were capa ble of overpowering the Jews. This is also the reason why when one washes his hands in the prescribed manner ( Netilat Yadayim ) he must lift his hands upward, as in the verse, (Psalms 134:2) “Uplift your hands to Kodesh – holin ess”. As previously stated , the aspect of Kodesh (generally) refers to the th ree intellectual qualities. This is because the arousal of the emotional qualities can become separate d from the light of the intellect and the light of the intellect and inner intent can become concealed. Because of this it is possible for influence to become separated from the light of the intellect and truth . This separation is the root of the external forces of evil (the root of which is the sense of self -existence, separate and apart from G -d). This is even more so in the case when there are only the aspects of Netzach and Hod , which are only the aspect of the emotional acknowledgment and submissi on (as explained previousl y in regard to the “ cold thought ” ), which only comes from an impression of the l ight of the emotions , (and an even lesser impression of the light of the intellect). In contrast, when the light of the intellect and “truth” radiates within the emotions in a revealed manner , these qualities do not become separated from the intellect. O n the contrary, they are ruled by the light of the intellect and “truth”, as previously explained at length. (See Etz Chaim , Shaar 31, Ch. 2.) 37 This is an acronym for the three sefirot of the middle line, Da’at, Tiferet, and Yesod . 38 See tractate Yevamot 53b. There it states that, in a man, there cannot be sexual arousal against his will and that he cannot have an erection without Da’at . (This is applicable in the realm of Torah laws dealing with rape and other sexual issues (such as Yibum - Levirate Marr iage). However, on a more mystical level of"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"therefore , find that the aspect of Yesod and the aspect of Da’at in the brain of the head are bound together a s if they are one entity.) This is because Da’at , [which] is an inner [light] , radiates and is bound up to the mercy of the heart. T hey are one at all times , literally. This is similar to the statement in Zohar , 39 “ Moshe is inside and Yaakov is outside”. This is the aspect of Da’at , which is the innerness of the emotions of mercy. 40 This is because the measure of mercy will literally be comme nsurate to the measure of Da’at . Moreover, who ever does not have Da’at is cruel, such as children, or the like. [However], the more one increases his Da’at , 41 the more will he feel merciful. This is because , as explained elsewh ere at length, there is no interruption, whatsoever, between Da’at and Rachamim (Mercy), as there is between the aforementioned aspects of Chochmah (Wisdom) and Chessed (Kindness). 42 [Furthermore,] there most certainly is a bond [of the Daat ] with the influence of Yesod , which is t he aspect of the connection of the influencer to the recipient. 43 This [connection ] comes about instantaneously from Da’at , as       understanding, this is another indication of the unity and bond between the sefirot of the middle line of DaTi”Y . In other words, the bond between the aspect of Da’at in the head, the aspect of Tiferet of the heart, and the aspect of Yesod (which is called “the sign of the holy covenant – Ot Brit Kodesh ”, i.e. the circumcision, and is compared to the male reproductive organ), is instantaneous, as if they are literally one. It is for this reason that in describin g the marital relations of Adam and Chava, the Torah uses the terminology for Da’at (simply translated as “knowledge”), as in the verse, “ and Adam knew Eve ” etc, as will be explained. 39 See Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 13 (28a) , and Etz Chaim, Shaar HaKlallim, Chapter 8 . 40 It was already mentioned at the end of chapter one that Moshe corresponds to the aspect of Da’at . This is why Moshe was the leader of the generation known as “ Dor De’ah – The Generation of Knowledge” (i.e. Da’at ). (See Etz Chaim, Shaar HaKla llim, Chapter 11. ) 41 Here the Rebbe uses the terminology of Ecclesiastes 1:18 42 The attributes and qualities of the middle line are commensurate to one another, which is not the case with the right and left lines etc. 43 As mentioned previously, and as will be explained in the following chapter, the aspect of Yesod is the aspect of the unification of the influencer ( Mashpia ) and recipient ( Mekabel ) and the spreading forth of influence from influencer to recipient. This general principle is true on every lev el. For example, the physical connection and spreading forth of influence between the male and female is through the aspect of Yesod (i.e the “sign of the Holy covenant” - the circumcision). Likewise, the actual unification between Chochmah and Binah is specifically through the aspect of Yesod of Abba , as explained previously. The same is true of any unification between any “influencer” and “recipient” . I t is through the aspect of Yesod , as will be further explained in the following chapter. This is on ly possible because of the fact that Yesod is an aspect of the middle line and is thus bound with the essence of the influencer etc. As was previously explained (see Ch. 26), this external bond and influence between the influencer and recipient is specifi cally dependant on the most internal aspect of pleasure and desire ( Keter – Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin ). For example, as explained there, in order for a child (i.e. a new soul) to be born, it is necessary for there to an inner unification of Abba (Father) and Imma (Mother) through the aspect of the Yesod of Abba (“father”, i.e. the influencer) and Imma (“mother”, i.e. the recipien t). However, as explained, the connection , arousal and “seminal drop” of Yesod of Abba (the influencer) is dependant specifical ly on the aspect the “head” and “brain” of Abba and the inner pleasure ( Atik Yomin ) etc . For i n truth, in order for there to be an issuance of the seminal dr op, there must be an investm ent of the self, which is brought about by the aspect of pleasure ( Ke ter ). Thus, there is a unity and bond between all the aspects of the middle line. That is, the influence to the recipient from the aspect of the Yesod of the influencer is dependant upon the more inner faculties of the Tiferet of the heart, and even more specifically the aspects of Da’at (interest or focus) and Keter (desire and pleasure) of the head etc. Hence, just as the aspect of Tiferet , which is the aspect of compassion , is dependant upon the aspect of Da’at (i.e. “knowledge” and intellectual conne ction) - so is it with the aspect of Yesod . Because of this reason the Torah states, “ And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore etc. ” (Moreover, in the final influence there is a unity and bond with the beginning source, as"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"in [the verse], 44 “And Adam knew Eve [his wife; and she conceived and bore etc]”. 45 Th is is in accordance with the statement in Zohar Bereshit regarding [the verse], 46 “Let the waters [under the heav en] be gathered into one place”. T his is the aspect of Yesod 47 in which all the influence gathers. I t is thus called , “The ingathering of all the lights”. 48 This, then, is the aspect of the middle line, [ which is, “T he inner beam] which passes through... from one end to the other ” . It is for this reason that [the middle line] is called “Truth – Emet ” ( אמת ), which is made of the letters Aleph – א , Mem – מ , and Tav – ת . [These letters are] the first, middle, and last letters of the [Hebrew ] Aleph -Bet , 49 for, as [Truth] is in its beginning, so is it in the end, this being the principle aspect of T ruth. Because of this [the sages] stated, 50 “Yaakov did not die”, since, because of this very reason, death ( Mavet ), which       explained at leng th in the explanations of “What ( Ma”H ) is his name and What ( Ma”H ) is his father’s name etc. In the words of Sefer Yetzirah , “The beginning is bound with the end, and the end with the beginning,” referring specifically to the unity of the middle line.) A n additional analogy, regarding a very wise individual, was given before to express the same point . It is specifically because such a person knows the depth of the concept at the very source of its inception that he is capable of influencing it to someone on a m uch lesser intellectual level than himself, even on the level of a small child. His ability to bring down the concept ( Yesod ), is dependant upon his grasp of it to its very depth ( Keter ). The two, i.e. the depth of his grasp and the ability to bri ng the concept down, are totally interdependent and commensurate to each other. This was explained at length (in chapters 2, 3, 26). Now, just as this is so in Chochmah itself ( Abba ), so is it in Zeir Anpin . This is to say that the unifications and infl uence between Zeir Anpin (the male influencer) and Nukvah (the female recipient), come about through the aspect of Yesod of Zeir Anpin (as will be explained later at length). The manner of unification and influence is likewise dependant upon the light and revelation in the “head” of Zeir Anpin . We therefore find a unity and bond between all three aspects of the middle line, so much so, that they are literally interdependent and commensurate to each other, which is not the case in regard to the right and l eft lines. (The unifications of Zeir Anpin and Nukvah will be discussed in following chapters, mainly chapter thirty -seven.) 44 Genesis 4:1 45 Parenthesis of the Rebbe: (There is an internal aspect of NeHi”Y which are the “Kidneys that gi ve council”, and th e innerness of Yesod is the “End of the body; [the sign of the holy covenant]”. The externality of Netzach and Hod , [however,] are “the two thighs”.) [See Tractate Brachot 61a; introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a; Tikkunei Zohar , Tikkun 13 (29a).] 46 Genesi s 1:9 47 See Zohar Bereshit 18a & 33a. 48 There are various explanations in the Zohar regarding the verse, “And G -d said let the waters under the heaven be gathered to one place.” The “waters” refers to the aspect of the point (of the light of the intellect and Chochmah ). The words, “under the heavens”, refer to the aspect of this influence of the intellect as it comes forth from the aspect of Tiferet . (This is because “ Shamayim – Heaven” ( שמים ) refers to Tiferet of Zeir Anpin , which is the unification of Aish – Fire ( אש ) (i.e. Gevurah ) and Mayim – Water ( מים ) (i.e. Chessed ) , but the aspect of “ under the heavens - Shamayim ”, refers to the influence that comes forth from Tiferet to Yesod .) T he verse then continues and says that these waters should “be gathered to one place”, which is the aspect of Yesod . In other words, all the influence of the upper sefirot gathers in Yesod to be influenced down to the recipient. Because of this Yesod is c alled “the ingathering of all the lights”. (Thus, the aspect of the light that is influenced from Yesod is interdependent with the light that it receives from the point of Chochmah in the head etc.) (Also see footnote 43. The aspect of Yesod will be addr essed more thoroughly in the following chapter.) 49 See Bereshit Rabba , Parsha 81:2. (For example: א ' ב ' ג ' ד ' ה ' ו ' ז ' ח ' ט ' י ' כ ' ך ' ל ' מ ' ם ' נ ' ן ' ס ' ע ' פ ' ף ' צ ' ץ ' ק ' ר ' ש ' ת ' ) 50 See Tractate Ta’anit 5b. (Also, as will be pointed out momentarily, (and as was explained footnote 33 above) this does not primarily refer to the external aspect of Yaakov , but actually refers to the aspect of Yisrael ( Li Rosh – A Head for Me) etc. Nevertheless, even in the external aspect of Yaakov there is no aspect of complete “death”, but rather o nly an aspect of “limping”, as will be explained.)"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"is the root of the external shells ( Kelipot ), has no foothold whatsoever in the middle line. 51 It is for this reason that it states, “You have ruled over Elokim ” [which is] the aspect of Ba”N . Now, this specifically [refers to] the a spect of Da’at and Chochmah which are in the head of Yisrael ( ישראל ) [which spells] “ Li Rosh - a head for me” ( לי ראש ), as explained previously. Because of this [the angel] told him , 52 “ Yisrael sha ll be your name”. 53 However, this is not the case in regard t o [the aspect of] Yaakov . This is because the aspects of Netzach and Hod, which are the “two thighs”, come from the powers of Chessed and Gevurah of Avraham and Yitzchak. 54 Thus, for the reason stated above, he [was able to] hit   51 Death represents the cessation of that which is not always true. In other words, whatever is false does not endure forever. In contrast, truth endures forever, as previously explained regarding the vers e, “The lip of truth is established forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment”. Thus, although the right and left lines cancel each other out and ultimately cease, nonetheless, the aspect of Yaakov , which is the middle line and is the aspect of trut h (“give truth to Yaakov ”), never ceases or is destroyed, but is rather everlasting and endures forever. (For, although the truth may sometimes become concealed by the false, it nevertheless, continues to be true. Eventually, when the false ceases to be, it will be revealed.) This is also the difference between the influence from the sefirot of Tohu, about which it states (Gen. 36), “And he reigned... and he died” etc., compared to the aspect of Tikkun which never ceases, but is rather everlasting and etern al. For, as previously explained; the middle line is greater than the divisions of the right and left lines in that it reaches all the way up to and is completely bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof ), the True Being who is everlasting and eternal. Therefore, there is no “death” or “cessation” in the middle line (although there may indeed be an aspect of the concealment of the revelation of the absolute truth – this being the difference between Yisrael and Yaakov ). It is f or this very reason (i.e. the fact that it is literally bound up with the Essence of the Infinite Light) that it is capable of rectifying and inter - including the opposites of the right and left lines throughout the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishta lshelut ). In other words, because it is bound up with the Essence of G -d, within whom all opposites converge and are thus not opposites at all (as explained in chapter 10), it is therefore capable of bringing about inter -inclusions throughout the entire c haining down of the worlds (as explained in chapter 15). Thus, it is specifically the aspect of the middle line, i.e. the sublimation to the Truth of the Infinite Light (which is vested and revealed within the Light of Chochmah ) which is capable of rectif ying and clarifying the aspect of Ba”N , as previously explained. This, then, is the meaning of “ Yaakov did not die”, for when one is bound to the Essence of the Infinite Light there is no death, for he is bound to the very source of life itself. (The Sag es therefore made a similar statement in regard to Moshe (Tractate Sota 13b), who is also an aspect of the middle line as previously mentioned. It is also for this reason that the Sages stated that the righteous are considered alive even after their passi ng, while the wicked are considered dead even while they are still alive.) 52 Genesis 35:10 53 See footnote 33 of this chapter. All of these concepts have already been explained at length. 54 In other words, the aspect of Yaakov is ruled by the emotional aro usal of Chessed and Gevurah of the heart, and receives its influence from there. As previously explained, this, itself, is the reason for the concealment of the light of Chochmah and Truth (i.e. the Yod ( י ) of Yaakov ( יעקב ) etc ). Thus, it is possible for there to be a certain degree of dominion of the external forces within the aspect of Yaakov , about which it states, “He hit him in the hollow of his thigh,” i.e. in the aspect of Netzach . However, such i s not the case with Yisrael , about whom it states, “Even the Netzach of Yisrael will not lie”. (As explained before, the light and revelation of Chochmah is the aspect of truth. The reason for this is quite simple. This is because Chochmah is the aspect of a flash of insight into the truth of something. That is, he perceives the truth of it with the eye of his mind. He “sees” and perceives how it is in essence, and is “enlightened” to the truth of it. It is for this reason that it is also called “ligh t”, since light and darkness determine a person’s perception of the truth. When a person is in a dark room, he will not perceive the truths of the room. Because of the darkness and the resulting lack of perception of the realities of the room, he may stum ble or stub his toe on the objects in the room that are hidden from his perception. In contrast, when the light is turned on, it illuminates the darkness and as a result, since he perceives the reality of the room and the"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"him in the hollow of his thi gh, which is the aspect of Netzach of the right line. In contrast, regarding Yisrael it states, 55 “And also the Netzach of Yisrael does not lie etc”. This is because Yisrael is the inner aspect of the emotions of Chessed and Gevurah , which is the aspect o f Da’at of the middle line, about which it states, “For y ou have ruled etc”. Likewise, [the reason for the statement] Yaakov did not die , is because it states, 56 “They die, but not in wisdom”. (Similarly, the Sages stated, 57 “ Yaakov serves in the heights” , which refers to Chochmah and Binah , for, “Great is De’ah [since it was placed between two Divine Names]”. 58 This is higher than the “ chest ” , 59 as explained elsewhere.) However, this is all in regard to the source of Yaakov which is much higher, in the asp ect of the middle line of DaTi”Y , for the above mentioned reason . However, in regard to the externality of the emotions of Yaakov it states, “He hit him in the hollow of his thigh”, as explained elsewhere. 60 This will suffice those of understanding.       objects that are within it, he wi ll not stumble at all. However, in actuality, the truth was there all along, whether he perceived it or not. This is the difference between Yisrael and Yaakov .) 55 Samuel I 15:29 56 Job 4:21. The literal translation is, “They die, for they are without wis dom”. However, this implies that in wisdom there is no death, which is the intent of the Rebbe above, as will be expressed momentarily. 57 See Zohar Vol. 1, 133a. 58 The verse (Samuel I 2:3) states, “ Ki E - l De’ot Havayah – For the L -rd is a G -d of knowledge ,” and places the aspect of Da’at ( De’ot ) between the two Divine names of “ E-l ” and “ Havayah ”. Thus, the Sages stated ( Tractate Brachot 33a ), “Great is Da’eh since it was placed between two Divine Names.” The Maharsha explains this statement of the Talmu d to mean that the aspect of Da’at exists between the aspects of Chochmah and Binah . Thus, the relationship of this statement to our chapter is self understood. 59 The “Chest” is a reference to the emotional sefirot of ChaGa”T , as previously explained. 60 The aspect of Yaakov may be bett er understood by understanding two di fferent explanations of the same verse. The verse (Malachi 3:6) states, “I Hashem have not changed, and you the sons of Yaakov have not ceased.” The first explanation is that just as I Hashem have not changed, so too, the G -dly light which dwells within the sons of Yaakov (i.e. the Jewish people) , also has not ceased. As known, t his aspect of the G-dly light which dwells within them, which is called the Shechinah (The Indwelling Presenc e of G -d), dwells within them even during the time of exile , in which they are sunken in their impurities etc. (Lev. 16:16) . This is the matter of the G -dly Spirit which motivates each and every Jew to return to Hashem with all his heart and soul and to a ttach himself to Torah and Mitzvot. Though the yoke of earning a livelihood overpowers them and deep preoccupations confu se their brains and hearts, never theless, those who falter shall not be completely cut off and fall , heaven forbid. This is as stated (Song of Songs 8:7) , “Great waters cannot extinguish the love”. This means tha t even the “great waters” of preoccupation with one’s livelihood, can not extinguish the light of this great essential love for G -d. T his is because it is like a nature embedde d in our very souls, as explained elsewhere. This is because this love literally i s an aspect of the G-dly light, which is called “the spirit instilled in her” ( Zohar Mishpatim 99b) and is called the Shechinah, in which there is neither change nor exchang e. This then, is the meaning of the verse, “I HaShem have not changed, and you, the children of Israel, have not ceased”. Therefore, even during the time of exile , in which there is a great concealment of G -dliness in the world, nevertheless , the Jewis h People have an essential bo nd and love of G -d. It is because of this essential nature of the G -dly soul of every Jew that no matter how distant he finds him self from the path of G -d, nonetheless, through true self -sacrifice, he always is capable of retu rning to G -d. (See the introduction to Shaar HaEmunah, 1a.) The second explanation of this verse is as follows: The words of the verse are, “ I Hashem have not changed, and you the sons of Yaakov have not ceased.” It is possible for a person to contempl ate how “I Hashem have not changed,” and yet not to be moved to completely invest himself in bonding and cleaving to G - dliness. That is, in the second part of the verse, “you the sons of Yaakov have not ceased,” the word used for cease, “ Khilitem – כליתם” shares the same root as the word “ כלות הנפש ” which generally translates as “the expiry of the soul” when it cleaves to G -d. It is explained that the reason for this lack of investment"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"End of Chapter Thirty Five       is specifically because we are speaking here of the aspect of “t he sons of Yaakov ”, who are dominated by the aspect of the natural animal soul. (See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5652, pg. 64.) We may therefore compare the aspects of Yaakov and Yisrael to the G -dly soul of a Jew. Every Jew has an eternal G -dly soul. However, i t is possible that his G -dly soul may become covered over and concealed by the animal soul and his physical nature etc. This is to say that the G -dly soul ( Ma”H ) may be in a state of “ Katnoot ” - immaturity, and be overpowered by the nature of the animal s oul ( Ba”N ). In such a state the animal soul covers over and conceals the true potential of the G -dly soul, and therefore impedes a person from binding himself and cleaving to G - d. On the contrary, it may, “hit him in the hollow of his thigh”, causing him to “limp” and veer off the path. Nevertheless, it can never destroy his G -dly soul completely, since it is essential to him, but can rather only cover it over and conceal it. Even while he is, “amongst the impurities”, nonetheless, his G -dly soul (the l ight of the upper Chochmah ) dwells within him, as mentioned above. However, the G -dly soul is in a state of immaturity ( Katnoot ) and is dominated and “ruled” by the animal soul. Nonetheless, at all times it is possible for him to repent and return to G -d, thereby revealing his G -dly soul. In other words, through toil in the service of G -d, it is possible for him to cause the G -dly soul to overpower and “rule over” the animal soul. Similarly, as explained in the previous chapter, Yaakov represents the “i mmaturity – Katnoot ” of the light of Chochmah ( Ma”H ) within the emotions, i.e. as it is covered over by the aspect of the natural and animalistic aspect of the emotions ( Ba”N ). Although it is possible for there to be a concealment of the aspect of Yaakov ( Ma”H ) – which is the light of Truth in its concealed state - nevertheless, it does not undergo the aspect of “death” or cessation, but rather, only an aspect of concealment. (This is to say that it is possible for the aspect of Yaakov to be overpowered t o a degree by the external forces, such as being, “hit in the hollow of his thigh”, causing him to limp – and thus not walking “straight”, as mentioned above. However, the truth is still the truth, and is merely concealed and, therefore, unapparent.) How ever, through toil and self - investment (“ Mesirat Nefesh ”) in the service of G- d (“ Avodat HaBirurim ” ) and through the development and maturation explained in the previous chapter, the aspect of Yisrael, which represents the state of “ Gadloot ” - maturity, be comes revealed. Then it is the light of the G -dly soul ( Ma”H ) which overpowers and “rules” over the animal soul ( Ba”N ). This state of being no longer is called Yaakov ( יעקב ) but is rather the aspect of Yisrael ( שר א \" ל or לי ראש ), which is when the aspect of the light of Chochmah and truth radiates within the emotions in a revealed manner, thus “ruling over” the emotions, rather than vice -versa."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"  Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A. Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty -Six Now, it is written, 1 “These are the offspring of Yaakov ; Yosef ”. [ Yosef ] is the aspect of Yesod , 2 which is the aspect of the “Upper Righteous One” ( Tzadik Elyon ). 3 He is also called “the small Vav ” ( Vav Ze’ira ) etc . 4 Now, the explanation of these things is known regarding the matter of [t he verse, 5 “Yours, G-d, is the greatness ( Gedulah ), 6 and the might ( Gevurah ), and the glory ( Tiferet ), the victory   1 Genesis 37:2 2 Out of all the characters in the Torah it is specifically Yosef who is traditionally referred to as, “ Yosef HaTzadik ” (Joseph the Righteous). This is because although he was put in a situation of great temptation, he nevertheless restrained himself (in the aspect of Yesod, which corresponds to the male reproductive organ) when tempted by the wife of Potiphar (Genesis 39). (Noach too is likewise call ed “A Righteous Man – Ish Tzadik ,” for although he lived in a very immoral generation, he guarded himself against immorality etc.) Regarding the righteous, the verse (Proverbs 10:25) states, “ V’Tzadik Yesod Olam – The Righteous is the foundation of the wo rld.” According to Kabbalah this verse is understood to mean that the aspect of the Tzadik (a righteous individual) is synonymous with the aspect of Yesod . The reason for this will be explained later in the chapter. Nevertheless, we can now understand w hy it is specifically Yosef who is called Yosef HaTzadik (Joseph the Righteous) and is the vehicle and “chariot” for the supernal attribute of Yesod . Because of this the verse states, “These are the offspring of Yaakov ; Yosef etc.” ( See Zohar, ( Ra’ayah M ehemnah ) Pinchas 236a., Zohar at the beginning of Parashat Noach, Pardes Rimonim , Shaar Erchey HaKinuyim ( Shaar 23) section on Yosef .) 3 Elsewhere it is explained that there are two aspects; “The Upper Righteous One” ( Tzadik Elyon ) which is Yesod of Zei r Anpin of Atzilut and is represented by Joseph and “The Lower Righteous One” ( Tzadik Tachton ) which is Yesod of Nukva of Atzilut - The Female ( Malchut ) and is represented by his brother Benjamin. As previously mentioned, the aspect of Yesod is the connecti on and bond between the influencer and the recipient. Now there are two aspects in this regard; the aspect of the love and connection of the influencer to the recipient which is called “The Upper Righteous One”, and is the aspect of the Yesod of the male, and also the aspect of the love and connection of the recipient to the influencer, which is called “The Lower Righteous One” and is the aspect of the Yesod of the female. Since in his relationship with his brother Joseph, Benjamin was the recipient of infl uence, rather than the giver of influence, therefore he represents the female aspect in this respect. (See Shaarei Orah 27a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mekeitz pg. 297 -299) 4 That is, Yaakov ( Tiferet ) is called the “Big Vav ”, as explaine d at length in the previous chapter. In contrast, Yosef ( Yesod ) is called the “Small Vav ” and is a lesser extension of the “Big Vav” . (See Zohar, Acharei 74b.) 5 Chronicles I 29:11. The following is a transliteration of the Hebrew text of the verse; “ Lecha HaShem HaGedulah, V’HaGevurah, V’HaTiferet, V’HaNetzach, V’HaHod, Ki Kol Bashamaym U’BaAretz, Lecha Hashem HaMamlachah (i.e. Malchut) etc.” 6 The quality of Gedulah (Greatness) is synonymous with the attribute of Chessed (Kindness). In older works of Kabbalah the quality of Chessed is often referred to as Gedulah . The reason for this is because"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"( Netzach ), and the majesty ( Hod ):] for all 7 t hat is in heaven and on earth is yours.” The [Aramaic] translation of this [latter part of the v erse] is, “He unites the heavens and [the earth ] ”. Thi s is the aspect of the light of the influence of Yesod , the Upper Righteous One , who is called “the life of the worlds.” 8 By way of analogy, one who understands the light of an [intellectual] concept in and of himself, but does not have the power to bring the light of this concept forth to influence it outside [ of himself] to a recipient, behold, this is still only the aspect of the essence o f this influence, as it is in him self. However, one who is c apable of bringing it out as an influence and revelation to recipients is called the aspect of Yesod . He is called, “He who unites [the heavens and the earth]”, drawing forth [influence] from the influencer to the recipient . 9       here Gedulah -Greatness means largess, generosity and magnanimity, which is a function of Chesed - Kindness. 7 Yesod is called by the name Kol - All, because it dra ws influence from all the upper Sefirot which are above it and brings it down to Malchut. Since all existence is dependent on this, it is thus called Kol - All. Furthermore, the words כי כל – Ki Kol in the verse have the same numerical value as the word יסוד – Yesod. ( כי כל = יסוד = 80). (See Sha’arei Orah, Sha’ar Two by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilia.) 8 These three names, “ Yesod”, “ The Upper Righteous One” and “The Life of the Worlds”, are inte r-related. That is, it is the aspect of Yesod which brings forth influence and vitality from the influencer to recipient. He is thus called “The life of the worlds” ( Chay HaOlamim ) because He is the source of the life of the world. He is called Tzadik -The Righteous One, because all influence of goodness and blessings to the world comes through Him and He is called Yesod - Foundation, because since all existence and life force comes through Him, He therefore is the foundation of the world, upon which everythi ng rests. This is the meaning of the verse, “The Righteous is the foundation of the world – V’Tzadik Yesod Olam וצדיק יסוד ( ” עולם ). (See Zohar, Miketz 193b. See the morning prayers, Baruch SheAmar . Also see Siddur (of The Alter Rebbe) pg. 86d. Also see Pirush HaMilot pg. 77c ( עז ע \" ג ). Also see Sha’arei Orah, Sha’ar Two, by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilia.) 9 This may be understood by the example of a person who is wise and knows a subject very well in and of himself. However, if he would need to influence and reveal it to a recipient who is not on the same level as he is, he would be incapable of finding the appropriate words of instruction and knowing how to convey the concept by lowering and tailoring it to the capacity of the recipient, so that he too could understand and assimilate it. This being the case the influence remains concealed within him and can never be revealed. On the other hand, there could be another individual who possesses the vessel or talent to find the appropriate words of instruction an d therefore knows how to convey and draw down conceptual influence to a recipient. Such a person is considered to be in the aspect of the male organ ( Yesod D’Dechoora ) because he is capable of influencing a recipient. This principle likewise applies to the Yesod of the emotions. The emotions, which are Kindness, Severity and Mercy ( Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet ) are the essential emotional influence as it exists in and of itself. However, the ability to draw this influence down to a recipient is the quality of Yesod. This is considered to be the uniting of the heavens, i.e. the influencer, to the earth, i.e. the recipient. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat MiKeitz, p.292.) The reason why he has this ability to convey and lower the concept is not solely d ue to the great and expansive wisdom of the teacher. Rather, in order to influence intellect to another, there must be a tzimtzum - restraint of the intellect and a specific description of the letters of the concept in and of themselves, different from how the concept exists in its essential state. Because of this, if the mind of the teacher is preoccupied in comprehending the essential concept, he will be incapable of restraining his thoughts to distinguish and isolate a small part of it with the intent of making it comprehendible to a recipient. Now, this ability to restrain oneself to a specific detail of a concept in order to explain it, rather than simultaneously entertaining all of it at once, in all its details, is the quality of Yesod. (See Ohr HaTora h, Parashat Masei, pg. 1401) Furthermore, the degree of the teacher’s ability to bring down the subject to the student is directly proportional to the degree of his desire and pleasure in bringing it down to the student. This is similar to the intellectual connection of a father to his son’s intellect when he teaches him with love and with the desire that his son should understand the subject. If not for this, even if the son would have overheard the same words from his father, while the father was learnin g by himself, nonetheless, he would not have understood nearly as much"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" This is as stated, 10 “Light is sown for the righteous” , and it states about light, 11 “[And G -d saw the light,] that it was good” , just as the aspect of Yesod is called “Good – Tov ” ( טוב ), 12 as in [the statement] , 13 “It is the nature of the good to bestow goodness” 14 specifically to anoth er. 15 Thus, the aspect of Yesod is called “Righteous – Tzadik ” and “Good – Tov ”, as       as he does now that his father makes a mental connection with him and speaks to him with love and desire, face to face. This is because he has a great desire that his son should unders tand. The greater is the father’s desire and pleasure in teaching the child, so will he have a greater influence upon him and the child will learn more. Through this the son will be able to receive more and, in turn, the father will therefore give more. Th is is because desire and pleasure cause his mind to expand and grow, with an expansive interest to influence and teach his son. A more physical analogy of this is the fact that the amount of sperm produced during marital relations is a result of the amount of desire and pleasure. To the degree of a person’s desire and pleasure, that is how much influence he draws down from his brain during conception. This is the reason why the sages of the Kabbalah compared the matter of the union of the Sefirah of Yesod with the Sefirah of Malchut to marital union. (See Tanya , Igeret HaKodesh, Part 15, pg. 122b -123a) 10 Psalms 97:11. 11 Genesis 1:3 12 See Zohar, Noach 60a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim p. 224. Also see Sha’arei Orah, Sha’ar Two, by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilia. 13 See Tanya, Shaar HaYichud VeHa’Emunah , Ch. 4. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim p. 5. Also see Torat Chaim, Bereishit , p. 30b and footnote 4 there. 14 In other words, Yesod is the conduit for all influence of existen ce, life and goodness in that first it receives from all the upper lights that are above it, as in the verse, “light is sown for the righteous”, and then it bestows this light and goodness to that which is lower than it, as in, “It is the nature of the goo d to bestow goodness.” 15 Yesod is similar to a Tzadik because a Tzadik is a totally selfless individual whose sole desire and intent is to benefit others. In this respect a Tzadik is like a water wheel that takes in on one side and gives out on the other s ide. This is facilitated by two types of selflessness - Bitul. This may be understood through the Teacher/Student analogy. In order to properly receive the teachings of the teacher, the student must set aside his own personality, empty himself of his own pre -conceived notions and put his trust wholly on the teacher’s knowledge of the subject, totally focusing himself on the wisdom being conveyed to him. When he is doing this he can only receive knowledge and influence, rather than give it. Later, once he has totally absorbed and assimilated what he was taught, he can give over the teachings to a recipient, who is his student. In order to do this he must again set aside his own personality and way of understanding the subject and only have the student’s benefit in mind, so that he can tailor his words to the capacity and personality of the student. When he is doing this he can only give over knowledge rather than receive it. This is similar to a water wheel. The receptacles of the water wheel cannot receive and pour out water simultaneously. Rather, they receive on one side of the water wheel and then pour out on the other side. Nonetheless, the whole purpose of the water wheel is to pour out water rather than to receive water. It receives water specifically in o rder to pour it out. This is why the water wheel was built in the first place. In the same way, even though the Tzadik must have both types of selflessness - Bitul, and must set aside his own personality in order to receive as well as to give, nonetheless, h is primary desire and purpose is to bestow goodness on others. This represents the ultimate selflessness, since while he is giving he cannot receive. However, ultimately, it is this very selflessness which gives him the ability to receive, because accordin g to how much he gives, that is how much he will receive. Just as it is with a water wheel, the giving and receiving are interdependent. As much water as the water wheel receives on the one side, that is how much it can pour out on the other side, and as m uch water as it pours out on the other side, that is how much it can receive on the one side. Now, in the same manner, the primary purpose of the Sefirah of Yesod is specifically to influence goodness to the Sefirah of Malchut. Likewise, as much as it give s, that is how much it receives and as much as it receives, that is how much it gives. The two functions are interdependent. Because Yesod has these functions of both receiving everything from the Sefirot that are above it, as well as giving everything to the Sefirah that is below it, it is therefore called Kol - All, and because it represents the ability to bring down blessings and goodness to Malchut, which is the recipient, it is called, “ Tov - Good”. As Explained above, this is because its entire purpose an d desire is only to draw"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"stated, 16 “Say of the righteous, that they are good , ” and it states, 17 “For [the L -rd is] righteous, He loves righteousness,” that is, 18 “to revive the spirit of the humble”, and as stated, 19 “ The L - rd is good to all.” (Moreover, the word “ Tov – Good” ( טוב ) has a numerical value of seventeen, 20 i.e. א \" ה ו \" ה , which are the first letters of the words [of the verse , 21 ] “ א ת ה שמים ו את ה ארץ – The Heavens and The Earth, ” that is, “He unites the heavens and the earth.” 22 This is the aspect of the connection of the influencer to the recipient, as is known and as explained elsewhere. [The aspect of Yesod ] is also called “ Shalom - Peace” 23 and “ Brit – Covenant” , as [the verse states] regarding Pinchas , 24 “Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.” This is in accorda nce with what is explained elsewhere regarding the di fference between the innerness of Yesod of Zeir Anpin , which is Yosef , and the externality of Yesod , which is the aspect of Noach 25 who is [also] called “righteous” and “perfect , ” 26 as stated in the Zohar . 27 )       down good influence to the recipient.

Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereishit, pg. 294 and pg. 328. Also see Shaarei Orah (of the Mittler Rebbe), pg. 170. 21 Genesis 1:1; Jeremiah 23:24. Also see Zohar Hashmatot , 251a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim p. 225. 22 The first two letters of this name ( א '' ה ) are the first two letters of the Divine name א - ה - י - ה which represent the highest levels of the highest Sefirah, wh ich is Keter (Pleasure and Desire) , whereas the last two letters of this name ( ו '' ה ) are the last two letters of the Divine name י - ה - ו - ה which represent the lower levels of Zeir Anpin and Nukva ( Malchut ) . As the Zohar states on the words, א ת ה שמים ו את ה ארץ – The heavens and the earth, “These words form the acrostic אהו '' ה , for with this name the heaven and the earth were created. The heave ns were created with the א '' ה and the earth and everything therein were created with the ו '' ה”. Thus we clearly see that this name represents the union of the higher levels (the heavens) with the lower levels (the earth). (See Zohar Hashmatot , pg. 251a) 23 As mentioned above Yesod unites the heavens, which is the aspect of the giver of influence, to the earth, which is the aspect of the recipient of that influence. Therefore, it is called Shalom - Peace, as in the verse, “Behold I give my covenant of peace etc . (Parashat Pinchas, 25:12) and as in the verse, “And you shall know peace in your tent” (Job 5:24), which constitutes the aspect of the bond of influence between the giver and the recipient. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, p. 226.) 24 Numbers 25:12. Also see Yalkut Reuveni, Parashat Korach, Dibur HaMatchil כשנקרא in which Pinchas is associated with the Sefirah of Yesod. In Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mikeitz, pg. 293, the Rebbe states that, more specifically, Pinchas personifies Yesod of the Sefirah of Chessed since he specifically received the Brit Kehunah - The Covenant of Priesthood. The priesthood ( Kehunah ) corresponds to the aspect of Chessed , as stated, “For you are a priest forever.” This refers to the aspect of Chessed , since t he word “You” is in the second person which is indicative of revelation. This is because the word, “You” indicates a direct relationship with the person spoken to. This is in contrast to the word “He” which is in the third person, and is indicative of con cealment. This is because the word “he” indicates that the relationship with the person spoken about is round about and indirect. (See Hemshech B’Sha’a SheHikdimu 5672, pg. 1.) 25 Since Yesod is good and represents the ability to influence a recipient, li ke a good person whose sole desire is to draw out and bestow goodness upon recipients, we therefore find that there are two aspects in Yesod. These are its inner and outer aspects. The inner aspect is the light of the influence of kindness and goodness of everything in his desire, intellect and emotions to their finest details, as they still exist within him . This is called Ish Tov - The Good Man, and is the level of Yosef. The external aspect of Yesod, which"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" This, then, is [the aspect of ] the “small Vav ”, 28 which is the aspect of the collecting and gathering of the light and influence of the emotional qualities of Yaakov 29 , which were explained above . This, then, is [the meaning of,] “These are the offsprin g of Yaakov ; Yosef ”. That is, the aspect of the offspring [i.e. influence] of the emotions is through Yosef specifically 30 , which is the “Light” that is “sown for the Righteous” [who receives from and is thus called] the “ Eighteen Worlds ” ( Chay Almin ). 31 Furthermore , it is written, 32 “The righteous man sha ll flourish like the palm tree and grow great like a cedar in the Leb anon.” For, the source of Yesod of Zeir Anpin is in Yesod of Arich Anpin and Atik Yomin which transcend the intellect. 33 For, “their beg inning is bound with       receives from the inner aspect, is the fact that all goodness and kindness is drawn from him. This is called Tzaddik Kee Tov - He is Righteous because he is good, and is the level of Noach. In other words, why is it that the external level is “righteous” and influences everything? It is specifically becaus e he is good in his essence, i.e. specifically because he receives from the inner level which is “good”. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mikeitz, pg. 292.) 26 Genesis 5:9 27 See Zohar , beginning of Parshat Noach . Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza ’ee , Kuntreisim p. 225. 28 Da’at is called the “Big Vav ”, because it includes within itself, in a heyulie form, the three heartfelt emotions of Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet, and the three gut emotions of Netzach, Hod and Yesod, all of which make up the six Sefirot of Zeir Anpin. These six come to the numerical value of the letter Vav =6. Now, the shape of the letter Vav ( ו ) is similar to a long pipe. This is because through Zeir Anpin the G -dly influence, which is likened to the masculine waters, descends to i nfluence Malchut, which is also called Nukvah - The Female or Imma Tata’a - The Lower Mother . However, all the levels higher than Yesod are still considered to be part and parcel of Zeir Anpin itself, whereas, though Yesod is still connected to Zeir Anpin and is an extension of it, nonetheless, it is already “protruding” and coming out of the “body” of Zeir Anpin . This is because it is totally focused on bringing the influence out to the recipient. Because of this it is likened to the male reproductive organ, w hich is like a “the small Vav ” and protrudes from the body for the purpose of impregnating the female. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntresim, L’Habin Shoresh Inyan Chevley Moshiach. ) 29 i.e Zeir Anpin. 30 i.e. Yesod. 31 The Eighteen worlds relates to the eighteen vertebrae of the spinal cord which is shaped like a Vav ( ו ) . It is specifically the spine which a) holds up the entire body and is thus the foundation of the body, and b) brings the influence down and thereby connects the Daat of the brain, all the way down to the lowest extremity of the body, which is Yesod . Th is being the case, Yesod , which is likened to the male reproductive organ, is considered to be the final extension from the spinal cord. This is because the influence of life force begins in conception as it exists in the brain, until it makes its way thro ugh the spinal cord and finally comes out of the male organ to impregnate the female. Because of this Yesod is likewise called, Chay Almin, which means “The Life of the Worlds” and also means, “The Eighteen Worlds”. Since Yesod receives the final life forc e and influence through the spinal cord, it is also called Chay Chooliot HaShedra - The Eighteen Vertebrae of the Spine. (See Tikkunei Zohar ( Tikkun 18) 31b; 33a. Also see Pardes Rimonim , Shaar 3, Ch.5 and Shaar 15, Ch. 2. Also see Torat Chaim, Parashat No ach, pg.53:a and Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Shmot volume II, Parashat Zachor, pg.499a. Also see Siddur HaAri’zal, Kol Yaakov by Rabbi Yaakov Koppel, Kavanat HaLulav. ) 32 Psalms 92:13 33 Yesod of Zeir Anpin is referred to as, “The righteous one who flourishe s like a palm tree and grows like a cedar in Lebanon” because it is the source of the birth of souls, which is the aspect of the light which is sown for the righteous. Now, since Yesod has this ability to give birth because it contains radiance from Ohr Ei n Sof - The Infinite Light, which can give birth beyond measure, therefore Yesod is comparable to a date palm which produces abundant fruit. However, Yesod is also compared to the cedar of Lebanon which grows in very high altitudes. Furthermore, it grows tal ler than all the other trees of Lebanon. In addition, its trunk expands incomparably thicker than other trees. We see that both the palm and the cedar indicate"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"their end” 34 for Yesod is called , 35 “the extremity of the body.” 36 It is for this reason that the       growth and expansion. Nonetheless, the palm indicates the growth and abundance of produce, where as the cedar indicates that the tree itself grows abundantly, in the spreading of its roots, the thickness of its trunk and its tremendous height. This illustration gives us insight into how it is above in regard to the aspect of the upper Tzaddik, i.e. Yesod of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut, about which the verse states, “For man is the tree of the field”. Zeir Anpin is compared to a tree which grows. This relates to the aspect of the emotions of Zeir Anpin, the “Upper Man”, which grow from a state of immaturity t o a state of maturity, similar to a tiny infant who’s intellectual and emotional faculties are extremely small and immature. Nonetheless, as explained before, in chapter 33, footnote 23, “Small pumpkins are discernable when they burst forth from their sap” . That is, the child begins to grow from its inception and continues to grow until the ripe old age of seventy when he reaches complete intellectual and emotional maturity in his insight ( Chochmah ) and higher in his pleasure and desire ( Atik and Arich ) and even higher in the source of desire and pleasure ( Adam Kadmon ), all the way up to the emotions of the Yechidah level of the soul itself, which are the essential qualities of the very essence of the soul, such as the essential kindness of the soul, which i s the original source of the pleasure and desire to do acts of kindness. Now, all this is analogous to the growth of the immature emotions of Zeir Anpin (as explained above in chapter 34) the purpose of which is to benefit and bring forth influence to th e worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah (Creation, Formation and Action). These emotions “grow” to maturity by the affect of the mature intellect of Insight ( Chochmah ) and Comprehension ( Binah ) on them, until they “grow” and reach up to Atik Yomin (The Emo tions of Pleasure), as explained in chapter 34 at length (regarding the maturation of Zeir Anpin ). These are called the emotions of an elder who has acquired wisdom from its source, i.e. pleasure and desire ( Atik and Arich ) with a completely mature intelle ct, and even from much higher until he reaches the very source of the source, which is the desire to do kindness in the Essence itself. It is because of this essential desire to do kindness that it arose in G - d’s will to emanate, create, form and make all the worlds in actuality, through the aspect of Yesod . This is because the function of the Tzaddik ( Yesod of Zeir Anpin of Atzilut ) is to reveal influence to the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. This is the reason why Yesod is below all the other Sefi rot at the conclusion of the world of Atzilut, so that it can receive influence from all of them . Because of this it is called Kneeshoo D’Chol Nehorin - The ingathering of all the lights. In other words, since its function is to reveal influence and bring th e lower worlds into existence, especially to give “birth” to souls, therefore, to accomplish this it must reach up all the way to the very first root and source of influence, which even precedes the source of the desire and the simple essential pleasure. T his is the level of the essential goodness and kindness in the very essence of G -d, literally. It is because of this essential goodness and kindness that He desires to do kindness and has the desire and pleasure to bring about the entirety of the chaining down of the worlds ( Seder Hishtalshelut ). This, generally, is the meaning of the verse, “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in the Lebanon”. In other words, the aspect of Yesod of Zeir Anpin can produce “fruit” like a d ate palm and give existence to the lower worlds and especially give birth to souls, specifically through the “growth” and “maturation” which reaches very high into the “Essential Goodness” and is called, “The Cedar of Lebanon”. The word Lebanon means, “The Whiteness” and refers to the “Upper Whiteness” or purity, which is the essential goodness of Ohr Ein Sof - The Infinite Light, and precedes the source ( Adam Kadmon ) of the desire and pleasure ( Atik and Arich ) of kindness, as mentioned above. This is the mea ning of the continuation of the verse, “and it will grow great like a cedar in Lebanon”. In other words, it will grow great in a limitless fashion, in a way of Ein Sof . Only then can, “Light be sown to the Tzaddik ” so that he can “give fruit abundantly” li ke a date palm. From all of the above we may also understand how “their beginning is bound with their end” in a more particular manner. That is, the influence at the “end” is entirely inter - dependant with its essential root in the “beginning”. (See Piru sh HaMilot, Chapter 133.)  34 This means that Yesod, which is the end and extremity of the “body”, as will be explained shortly, (See footnote 36 below) contains within itself a Tamtzit - distilled essence of all the levels above i t, all the way to the highest level, which is the “beginning”. This is the reason why Yesod is also called, “ Kol Chai -All Life”, because it has within it something of the aspect of everything. In other words it has something of all the upper lights as they vest within the vessels of expression, which represent the totality of the 248 “organs” of Zeir Anpin, all of which are included, in a heyulie form, in the “drop of semen” of Yesod, the"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"       root of which is the “brain of Abba ” ( Chochmah ), and even higher in t he pleasure and desire ( Atik and Arich ). This is because the 248 organs include something of all the revealed faculties of Chochmah and Binah ( Abba and Ima ) as they are in Zeir Anpin. Furthermore, they even include the “hidden” upper lights”, which are mor e concealed, such as the aspects of Atik and Arich (Pleasure and Desire) and even Adam Kadmon (the Desire of the Desire). In other words, Yesod contains something of all the hidden aspects: pleasure, desire, the hidden powers of the intellect and the emoti ons, and even the root of all roots, which is the aspect of the Essence of Ohr Ein Sof. Everything is included in the “drop of semen” of the Yesod of Zeir Anpin. This is so because it is specifically this “drop” which has the power to give birth to a “chil d” that possesses the qualities of his parent. Therefore the drop must possess, in a heyulie form, all the qualities of the parent. (See Pirush HaMilot, chapter 76.) 35 See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a. 36 The explanation of the matter is that it is s pecifically through the aspect of Yesod that the completion of the coming out of influence to the recipient, in a way of complete revelation, occurs. This is as written in Zohar Bereshit, on the verse, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one p lace. The Zohar states that this refers to Yesod because it is the ingathering of all the upper lights. This is to say that all the influence which is drawn down from the intellect of the brain, the emotions and gut emotions of the body, is drawn down to Yesod and gathers there, in order to be transmitted and revealed in the recipient, which is Malchut. This is the meaning of the continuation of the verse, “And the dry land appeared”. This refers to the revealed world (which refers to Malchut , as will be ex plained later). Now, Yesod is called by two related names: Siyooma D’Goofa -The Extremity of the Body and L’Bar M’Goofa - Outside of the Body. This may be understood by way of example, such as a person who wants to build a house or start a new business. In itially, what will arise in him is the perceived pleasure ( Atik ) in doing it, because if he has absolutely no delight or pleasure in it, he certainly will not be moved to act upon it. After the perceived pleasure, the desire ( Arich ) to do it is aroused in him. Subsequently, this desire becomes invested within the intellect and reasoning, thereby strengthening this desire. Then, from the intellect and reasoning ( Chochmah and Binah ), emotions are aroused in his heart, with love (heartfelt emotions) and yearni ng (gut emotions) to do it. After the emotions are aroused in his heart, they come out into revelation from the, ‘Breath of the Heart” in speech and action, once he “commands” his limbs to do, at which point he actually does it. The source which brings ab out the revelation of the speech and action is in the, “Breath of the Heart.” This is because the emotions ( Zeir Anpin ) and intellect ( ChaBaD ), and even the highest levels, which are the pleasure and desire ( Atik and Arich ), all gather there. This power in the “Breath of the Heart” to bring it out into revelation in speech and action ( Malchut ) is called the aspect of Yesod. It is specifically Yesod which brings the emotions and the intellect to a state of revelation in speech and action ( Malchut ). However, speech and action themselves, are only considered to be the recipients of this influence. Now, the best analogy for this is the matter of physical marital relations. This may be understood as follows: The coming into being of the seminal drop begins in t he pleasure of the brain, which in and of itself, is spiritual. It is then drawn out by way of the spinal cord until it first reaches the kidneys and then the testicles, as actual physical semen. There, it is incubated and “ripened”, so to speak. After it remains there for a short period, it comes out from the orifice of the male organ which is called the aspect of Yesod . It is through it that all influence of the “Masculine Waters” is drawn out into revelation until, finally, impregnation and fertilization occurs which produces an embryo. As the Talmud states in Chagiga 15a, this occurs when the semen shoots out with force, like an arrow. If it does not shoot like an arrow, fertilization is unlikely to occur. From all the above we find that the culminati on of the drawing down of influence from its root and inception, as it existed in the brain, takes place specifically in Yesod . It is specifically there that it comes into a state of completion from first being totally concealed in the desire and mind of t he donor to finally being revealed and given over to the recipient. Until the drop of semen actually reached the male organ ( Yesod ), it could still not be accurately defined as “influence” to a recipient. Rather, it was still part and parcel of the influen cer himself, which is called the “body”. In other words, as long as the influence for this drop of semen is still being drawn down through the spinal cord, the kidneys and the testicles, it is not considered to be anything outside of himself, since all the se levels are still part and parcel of the body. This"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"principal pleasure [is felt] specifically at the end of the influencing, as is known regarding the matter of, 37 “[And by the seventh day] G -d had ended [His work which He had done] etc.” 38       matter even applies to the testicles, since their function is to incubate the semen. However, while it is in the testicles, the influence has not yet “separated” in that it is still not issuing forth. R ather, it is specifically in Yesod that this takes place. Now, this being the case, even though Yesod is called, L’Bar M’Goofa - Outside of the Body, since it brings about the revelation of the influence to the recipient, by separating the influence out of the body, nonetheless, it itself is unified with the body. Thus it is also called, Siyooma D’Goofa - The Extremity of the Body. This is also the reason why it protrudes out of the body. On the one hand the sole reason for this is to make impregnation possib le, because the influence comes out from it. In this respect it is considered to be outside of the body. However, on the other hand, though it protrudes from the body, nonetheless, it still is unified with it, because otherwise it could not draw any influe nce from the body. In this respect, since it is united with the body so that it could gather all the masculine waters into itself, it is considered to be the final extremity of the body. From all these physical analogies we may now understand the analogu e, which is the aspect of the supernal Yesod and is also called, “The Upper Tzadik ”. This is to say that it is specifically in Yesod that the influence from all the “Upper Lights” culminates. In other words, the supernal pleasure and desire ( Atik and Arich ) is drawn down to insight and comprehension ( Chochmah and Binah ). From Chochmah and Binah it is drawn down to the heartfelt emotions ( Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet ), continuing down to the gut emotions ( Netzach and Hod ) until the light and influence reaches th e aspect of Yesod of Zeir Anpin which finally brings revelation to the recipient, which is the aspect of Malchut (Speech and Action). Thus Yesod is considered to be both outside the “body” of Zeir Anpin and the final extremity of the body, since it is unif ied with the upper emotions and intellect. Because of this it is called Kneeshu D’Chol Nehorin - The Ingathering of all the Lights”, as in the verse, “Let the waters be gathered to one place”, which refers to the supernal “waters”. This is also the meaning of the verse, “Everything in the heavens and the earth”, because Yesod unites the heavens ( Tiferet ), which is connected to the emotions ( Chesed and Gevurah ) and is called, “ Goofa - The Body”, to the earth ( Malchut ). This is why Tiferet is called “The Heavens ” ( Shamayim ), because the word Shamayim is made up of the words Esh and Mayim (fire and water) which represent Chesed and Gevurah (kindness and sternness). This is because Shamayim (the heavens) represents mercy ( Tiferet ) , which includes both Chesed and Ge vurah in itself, since it is a composite of the two. As explained above, Yesod connects the heavens to the earth, which is the aspect of the recipient, in that it connects to it in a manner of revealing and bringing down the influence of the “masculine wa ters” to the recipient. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, pp. 225 -226.)  37 Genesis 2:2. Also see Siddur (of the Alter Rebbe ) Shaar HaMilah 139b. Also see Likkutei Torah (of the Alter Rebbe ) , Tazria 20d. 38 Here the Rebbe i s answering the question of why it is that at the conclusion of the influence there is the greatest degree of pleasure and force. Logically, it would seem to be the other way around, that at the conclusion of the influence, the desire and longing would coo l down. For example, when a river flows a long distance from its source, its current slows down and becomes calm compared to the rapid current of the water when it was closer to its source. This is especially true if the river takes a winding and circuitou s route. The same principle is true when a rock it thrown. Certainly, its force is greater immediately upon leaving the hand of the thrower, and the further it travels, the more its force diminishes until it can no longer resist gravity and falls to the gr ound. If so, why is it that in regard to Yesod the opposite is true? Now, as explained previously, Yesod is the conclusion of the middle line of Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod . Da’at includes the potentiality for Chesed and Gevurah within itself , Tiferet is an inter -inclusion of Chesed and Gevurah , and likewise Yesod has an inter -inclusion of Chesed and Gevurah as they are drawn down from Netzach and Hod. This is because Netzach is a branch of Chesed and Hod is a branch of Gevurah. We therefore find that the final admixture and inter -inclusion ultimately takes place in Yesod, since it follows all the admixtures and inter -inclusions that took place in Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod, both internally and externally. "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"       This may be understood as follows: As expla ined before, Da’at is an intermediate between the two brains of Chochmah and Binah. It receives from the five kindness of Chochmah and the five severities of Binah and includes them all. Because of this Da’at has the power to cause the light of the intelle ct to lean either toward kindness or sternness in various different manners and aspects. Sometimes it causes the light of the intellect to lean toward kindness in several different manners, whereas other times it causes it to lean toward sternness. Now, th ere are many different ways that it could lean, each of which includes an admixture and inter -inclusion of opposite qualities. In other words, it never leans either toward absolute kindness nor absolute judgment. Rather, since in the world of Tikkun no one quality is absolute, therefore, of necessity, included within it is its opposite. Furthermore, as explained before, the synthesis and inter - inclusion of the opposite qualities of Chesed and Gevurah is the chief characteristic of the “Middle Line” which is made up of Da’at, Tiferet and Yesod . An example of this is that after the flood, G -d promised that He would no longer destroy the world. This is the quality of Chesed - Kindness . However, He also said that from then on people would no longer have life spans of several centuries as they did up to the time of the flood, but that rather, the average lifespan would not exceed one hundred and twenty years. This is the quality of Gevurah - Sternness. We see from this that the final decree included a synthesis and ad mixture of both Chesed and Gevurah. However, both the kindness and the sternness were a result of the same line of reasoning, i.e. that the inclination of man is evil from his youth. In the same manner the aspect of Da’at is capable of causing the intellec t to lean in many different admixtures and inter -inclusions of opposite qualities, since Da’at is the mediator between the intellectual kindness and the intellectual sternness of the mind. This is similar to the balance of a scale. The two sides of the sca le will lean proportionate to the weight on each side of the scale. This is likewise similar to a situation in which a person considers going into a new business venture. Initially the venture will seem wonderful and lucrative in his minds’ eye. However, immediately, he will start considering all the disadvantages and risks involved. This will negate his initial positive thoughts on the subject and will also result in the opposite effect. In other words, it will dampen his initial intellectual enthusiasm and desire for it. Now he sees the possible loss of his investment capital rather than the possible gain. Afterwards, his mind again swings the other way, and resolves the objections of the second perspective with yet a third line of reasoning. Now he once again appreciates the merits and advantages of investing his time, effort and money into this venture in his minds’ eye. This process continues back and forth, like a pendulum, until he finally settles on a decision within his intellect, as to how to go a bout setting up the business in the best, most efficient, profitable and effective fashion, with the least degree of risk. This final settling of the mind is called “ Yishoov Da’at ” (“The Settling of the Mind”). It takes all the pros and cons into considera tion and is the most reasonable synthesis of the two that he can arrive at. Now, the very same principle also applies in conveying a teaching to a student. This also involves a settling of the mind - Yishoov HaDa’at. It involves the admixture of the two op posites of Chesed and Gevurah in several different manners and aspects until he arrives at a specific decision of what he deems to be the best course to take in influencing the student in a positive fashion. This course of action will be an intermediate ma nner of conveying the teachings, somewhere between giving the student too much information, which is more than he can handle, and not giving him enough information. This is because, as known, in regard to every act of influence, before the influencer can i nfluence the recipient, two components must be present: Chesed and Gevurah. Chesed is that he desires to give over his goodness and kindness as they are in their true state. In the case of intellectual transmission, this means that he desires to give over the understanding of the concept as he understands it, with the same depth and expansiveness as it is in his mind. However, because he recognizes the limitations of the intellectual receptivity and readiness of the recipient, he finds it necessary to dimin ish and restrain the concept in his own mind, until it is reduced to the intellectual capacity of the student. This is because if he would give over the concept as it is, without explanations, examples and clarifications, thus bringing it down to the level of the student, the whole subject would be above the students’ head and he would understand none of it. In effect, giving the concept over in this way would actually amount to completely concealing it, which is a function of Gevurah and Tzimtzum (Sternnes s and restraint) . However, he decides against this path and settles on awakening the quality of Chesed , because he realizes that because of the extreme brevity of stating the concept as it is, without any analogies and explanations, the student would find it impossible to grasp. Therefore, the teacher considers and reconsiders the tension between giving too much information and not giving enough information,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"       several times in his Da’at, like a pendulum, until finally, he settles on an intermediate manner of giving over the concept in a way which would be most accessible and beneficial to the student. The final decision as to the course of action is a compromise between the two extremes of Chesed and Gevurah and is a synthesis and admixture of the two. Therefo re, it is the best and most effective way of giving over the teachings, because since it takes the capability and personality of the student into account and is tailored to his needs, it is the most likely to succeed. Now, just as this is the process in t he intellectual quality of Da’at which includes intellectual Chesed and intellectual Gevurah within itself , so too, the same principle applies to the emotions that are aroused in the heart by Da’at. This is to say that once the matter has been clarified in Da’at in a specific fashion, it then spreads down and arouses the emotions of the heart. There too there is an inclusion of Chesed and Gevurah as they are included in the heart, so that the emotion won’t lean too much to the right or to the left. Rather, they specifically follow the pattern settled upon by Da’at in relation to the intellectual emotions. This is the aspect of Tiferet which receives from Da’at in the aspect of the “Middle Line”, as known. This constitutes the deciding mediation of causing th e emotions of Chesed and Gevurah to lean in a manner which is a compromise between too much kindness and too much judgment. Here too, in the emotions of the heart, there is, once again, a back and forth process of deciding between opposite emotions, like a pendulum, until finally a compromise which is a composite of opposite emotions is settled upon. This composite emotion which is the synthesis of the two is Tiferet. Likewise, in the same fashion, once the emotions need to be brought down and translated into revealed influence to a recipient, the influencer must yet again take counsel in himself as to how to bring out the influence in the most appropriate manner. For although everything was considered and measured as to the proper consistency of admixture in the heartfelt emotions of the heart, in a way that was decided upon, which is the aspect of Tiferet, nonetheless, when he has to bring out actual influence from his essential self to the recipient, the whole back and forth process must be repeated agai n, but now on the gut level, which are the emotions as they relate to action. This is the aspect of Netzach and Hod which are the kidneys that give counsel as to how to bring out the influence in actuality. This is similar to the above mentioned example of a person who is considering going into a new business venture. Even though, in the emotions of the intellect, he already came to an intellectual conclusion, and in the heartfelt emotions he already came to an emotional conclusion, nonetheless, when it com es to realizing the business idea as an actual reality, since this is the ultimate fulfillment and point of the entire process, he must therefore take counsel within himself again on the level of Netzach and Hod - the gut level, and settle upon how to finall y take action and turn his financial goals into reality. Likewise, in the teacher \\student relationship, at the point that the teacher has to actually open his mouth and bring out the influence and teachings to his student, he must reconsider the whole ma tter anew on the gut level, when he is about to speak and decide exactly what and how much to say, how much to shorten and how much to lengthen, so that it should be best received and most beneficial to the student. This is the aspect of the “Kidneys” that counsel how to reveal the influence in actuality. Furthermore, as in the case above, this takes place even though he already contemplated the matter and came to both an intellectual and emotional conclusion. Nonetheless, up to this point, when he is about to open his mouth and actualize it, everything that took place before was all still “theoretical”, so to speak, and was still part and parcel of himself. From all the above we find that the conclusion of all the admixtures and inter -inclusions that took place in Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod, takes place specifically in Yesod. This means that by the time the influence reaches and is about to come out of Yesod, all that remains is only that influence which is necessary for the recipient according to his capabilities and what is most beneficial to him. Everything as it was prior to the level of Yesod, when it was on the level of Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod, was merely part and parcel of the influencer himself, in which he “speculated” within himself h ow the influence should essentially be or how it should be revealed to a recipient. However, the influence and revelation as it exists in Yesod is already being drawn out from the essential self of the influencer to the recipient. This is because once it r eaches Yesod it is solely according to what is necessary for the recipient of the influence, not more and not less. Because of this, even though it is called Siyooma D’Goofa - The Extremity of the body, in that"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"       it is still connected to Da’at, Tiferet, Netzac h and Hod, which are called “The Body”, nonetheless, Yesod is also call L ’ Bar M’Goofa - Outside of the body. It is called “Outside of the Body” because all the admixtures and inter -inclusions as they exist in Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod are still all par t and parcel of the “body”, so to speak. This is to say that they are all still within the essence of the influencer in and of himself and cannot yet be defined as being solely for the benefit a recipient who is outside of him. This is so because they all are still a process which takes place within him, whereas the aspect of Yesod is called “Outside of the Body” because it constitutes the drawing out of influence as it is specific to the recipient alone. According to all the above, we may now understand w hy it is that specifically toward the end and conclusion of the bringing out of influence, the flaming desire to conclude it comes out with force, rather than at the beginning or middle of the process, even though the analogy to the current of a river woul d seem to indicate the opposite. This matter may be understood through the fact that the aspect of Yesod is subsequent to the admixture and inter -inclusion of opposites that takes place in Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod which all are part and parcel of th e influencer himself. Only afterwards, in Yesod, does the influence which is solely for the needs of the recipient come out. However, all his difficult labor and effort in the aspects of Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod to synthesize and inter -include all t he opposites in several different modes, was solely for the final completion of the matter. It is specifically in the aspect of Yesod that this becomes completely revealed in a manner which is specific to the needs of the recipient. If not for this, he nev er would have gone to the tremendous toil and trouble of inter -including one thing with its opposite. This is because opposites are quite tiresome, in that they obstruct the essential flow of the influence. An example of this is an intellectual opinion tha t objects to the essential flow of influence, thereby causing the total restraint and cessation of the flow. The only reason there is a flow of influence at all is because afterwards he changes his opinion to one that leans toward kindness and the giving o f influence. Likewise, in Tiferet, which constitutes the synthesis on the level of the heartfelt emotions, the quality of Gevurah - Sternness completely obstructs the flow of emotional influence. Nevertheless, afterwards he reverts to a heartfelt leaning t oward Chesed - Kindness. However, this is in a way which resolves the objections of the obstructing feeling. A similar thing likewise takes place on the next level of Netzach and Hod, , which is the synthesis and admixture in order to actually bring out the i nfluence to the recipient. At first, the objecting side restrains and obstructs the influence from coming out and then afterwards he reverts and causes it to lean toward kindness. This happens on all the above levels several times, similar to a pendulum. T his being the case, therefore, what finally actually does come out, after all the obstructions, difficulties and clarifications, is the primary and essential thing . From this we understand that the whole intent, from the very beginning, even of the objecti ons on all these levels, was specifically that the influence should come out clearly, solely and specifically according to the needs of the recipient. Now, since all this great toil and effort, with so many obstructions, objections and difficulties, was so lely for the purpose of bringing the influence to completion in the best possible way for the recipient, therefore, when the influence does finally reach the point of being close to completion, it is specifically then that the desire to finalize it flares up in the influencer. This is because it is for this very reason that he troubled himself to such an extent, in the first place, with so much toil and effort, through the clarification of many opposites. If there had not been so many stages of admixture an d inter -inclusion of opposites in Da’at, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod, until the influence finally reached a state of completion in Yesod , then the longing and desire to complete it quickly would not have been so great, once it would reach the aspect of Yesod. It is specifically because there were so many objections and obstructions that towards the end the longing and desire to finalize it quickly becomes so great. The whole process is so that the final result will be optimally good. This is similar to a riv er which is dammed up in order to redirect the water to a specific spot. When the dam gates are finally opened up, the water surges through them with that much greater force. The water pressure is so great specifically because of the backup caused by the o bstruction. The same principle applies to physical marital relations. There is a “blockage” and delay, first in the brain, then in the spinal cord, the kidneys and finally in the testicles which incubate the semen. However, the reason of all this is for th e specific purpose of bringing out the influence in such a manner that a child will be born of it. As stated"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"(This is also the meaning of the verse, 39 “ And Yosef was well built [and good looking] . ” 40 That is, 41 “H is appearance resembled the beauty of Yaakov ” – which is the aspect of Tiferet of Zeir Anpin – “And the appearance of Yaakov resembled the beauty of Adam Kadma’a (The Primal Man),” 42 – which is the aspect of Arich Anpin and Adam Kadmon etc .) 43       above, this is most possible when the semen shoots out with force, like an arrow. Therefore, when the “drop” reaches Yesod (The male organ), it is specifically there that a great upsurge of desire wells up in him, which causes it to shoot with force. (This is compared to an arrow because just like when a person shoots an arrow, the force of its flight is directly commensurate to how tautly he pulled the bow string back.) (See Ma’amarei Admur HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim pgs. 227 -232) 39 Genesis 39:6 40 See footnote 51 below. 41 Bereshit Rabba , Parsha 84. 42 See Tractate Bava Basra 48a. 43 In other words, as explained above in footnotes 33, 34 and 38, Yesod is t he culmination of all the upper lights and vessels and receives from them all. However, it must be understood that Yesod is not just the last step of a process and that all the levels above it merely precede it. Rather, it contains all the upper lights wit hin itself. This is why it is called, “ Kneeshu D’Chol Nehorin - The Ingathering of all the Lights”. However, as the light and influence comes down, each level is only a glimmer of the radiance and “beauty” of the level that preceded it. Nonetheless, even tho ugh it is only a “ Tamtzit - distilled essence” of the higher level, it contains this higher level, as well as all the levels above that level, to the finest detail, in a hidden manner, until the influence finally reaches Yesod, which is the final “ Tamtzit - Di stilled essence” and contains them all. Nonetheless, all the levels are contained in it in a hidden fashion, just as all the characteristics of a child are “contained” in the DNA which is transmitted through the “drop of semen”. This is similar to the fact that though the Mishnah is brief and sparing in its wording, it inherently contains all the long and broad explanations of the Talmud within itself. This is self evident, since the entire length and breadth of the Talmud is a reconstruction of the logic o f the Mishnah. What was hidden in the Mishnah was brought into open revelation in the Talmud, through the deep analysis of its brief statements. This may be understood through the analogy of a Rabbi who teaches his student in a short manner. Now, what i s meant here by short is not that he actually shortens the subject by omission and fails to transmit key components of the concept. Since, in such a case, he would only be conveying part of the concept, therefore, he would not at all be conveying the conce pt in “short form”. Rather, such a form of teaching would be an actual abbreviation of the subject. In other words, he would only be giving the student a particle of the concept in a manner that it would be “cut off” from the rest of the concept. Because o f this, since many important components would be missing, the student would be incapable of ever grasping it properly. However, what we mean here by “teaching in short form” is that the teacher fully transmits the concept to the student, as he himself unde rstands it, with all its components, and to its ultimate length, width and depth, so that even the finest detail is not missing from it. However, because the mind of the student is not nearly on the level of the teacher, and it is impossible to transmit al l the intellectual light to him, as it essentially is, in all its length, width and depth, therefore, the teacher must search deeply within himself to discover brief explanations which could hold the entire theme and “ Tamtzit - distilled essence” of the conc ept, without losing any of its components. In such a manner the student will be equipped to arrive at a true grasp of the subject. As we see, this manner of teaching is radically different than the manner mentioned above because the teacher is not “shorten ing it” by divorcing one part of the concept from all its accompanying parts. He omits nothing. On the contrary, he transmits everything. However, he does so by conveying it in short terms, which though they are brief, are tailored to the capacity of the s tudent to digest them so that he will not become confused. However, since the student receives the teachings in short terms, and only understands the “surface” meanings of it, how could this be of benefit to him? As we said, his mind is not capable of pe netrating the depths of meaning inherent in it. If it was, the teacher would not have felt it necessary to shorten it in the first place. This being the case, why does the teacher “compress” the entire matter into these short statements? The answer is that though he is incapable of it now, nonetheless, as his mind matures and his insight and knowledge grow, eventually he will attain the ultimate depth of the Rabbi’s teachings. This is in"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" Now, regarding the words [of the aforementioned verse,] “These are the offspring – Eileh Toldot ” ( אלה תולדות ): This refers to the aspect of the “six directions” of Zeir Anpin each of which also include s six, 44 thus totaling 36 which is the numerical value of the word “ אלה ” (“these are”) . 45 However, there can be no “offspring” without an additional influ ence of new intellect from Abba and Imma , which is brought about by means of the maturation of Keter, Chochmah, Binah and Da’at of Zeir Anpin , as previously explained. 46       accordance with the Talmudic dictum that it takes forty years for a pe rson to plumb the depths of his Rabbi’s teachings. Similarly, in the example of the birth of a child, though it comes about through a tiny drop of semen, nonetheless, that drop contains within itself all the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical charac teristics of the parent. However, they are contained in it in a hidden fashion. In order to bring these characteristics out from their hidden state to a state of revelation, there must be development and growth, first during the embryonic and fetal stages and later during the stages of infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood, at which point the child himself can become a parent. In the same way, it must be understood, that just as it was explained above, in chapter 34 in regard to the stages of the ma turation of Zeir Anpin, so too, the same principle applies to Yesod which is the “ Siyooma D’Goofa - The Extremity of the Body” of Zeir Anpin and its culmination. (See Pirush HaMilot, chapters 75 -76.) 44 The six “directions” of Zeir Anpin are the three h eartfelt emotions, Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, and the three gut emotions, Netzach, Hod and Yesod, each of which is also made up of six. Chessed is made up of Chessed of Chessed, Gevurah of Chessed, Tiferet of Chessed etc. Gevurah is made up of Chessed of Gevurah, Gevurah of Gevurah, Tiferet of Gevurah etc. The same principle applies to all six qualities, totaling a sum of thirty -six qualities. 45 See also Likkutei Torah (of the Alter Rebbe ), Pikudei 4c. Also see Torat Chaim, Noach 56b, and footnote 15 there . 46 This may be understood through the verse (Isaiah 40:26), “ שאו מרום עיניכם וראו מי ברא אלה - Lift your eyes to the heights and behold who created these”. The word “ Eileh – These” ( אלה ) connotes revelation because it points to something which may readily be experienced, whereas the word “ Mee – Who” ( מי ) connotes concealment because it is said in a way of a question, as in the verse, “Who and which is He” ( מי הוא זה ואיזהו ). We, therefore, see that this indicates a level of G -dliness which is beyond our dire ct knowledge and experience. Now, as explained above in footnote 44, the word “ Eileh –These” ( אלה ), refers to the emotions of Zeir Anpin, which are drawn and aroused by the intellect. They are particularly born of Hitbonenut - Contemplation which is the aspec t of Binah - Comprehension. Because of this, Binah is called, “ Eim HaBanim – The Mother of the Children” ( אם הבנים ). The word “Mother” in this verse is referring to Binah and the word “Children” refers to the emotions, which are born of it. Now, in addition, Binah is also called, “ Mee – Who” ( מי). This is because the numerical value of the word “ מי – Who”, is 50 which refers to the 50 gates of Binah. Another reason Binah is called “ מי – Who”, is because, like Chochnah which is called “ Mah – What” ( מה ), Binah too is part of the concealed world ( עלמא דאתכסיא ) as opposed to the emotions of Zeir Anpin, which are already called the revealed world ( עלמא דאתגליא ). From the above we understand that the meaning of, “ Mee Barah Eileh - Who created These” ( מי ברא אלה ) i s that “Who” i.e Binah - Comprehension, is the source that gives birth to “ אלה – These”, i.e. the emotions. This is further supported by the fact that the name of our matriarch לאה – Leah, who represents the letters of thought, as will be explained later, ha s the same letters as the word “ אלה”. Thus it was specifically Leah who gave birth to six sons, i.e. the six emotions. From all the above we find that the word “ אלה – These”, is the aspect of the letter Vav ( ו ) of G - d’s four letter name. In other words, it represents the six emotions, each of which includes six, thus totaling thirty -six. This clarifies the meaning of the verse, “ אלה פקודי המשכן משכן העדות – These are the accounts of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of testimony”. The Hebrew word for “Account s” in this verse is פקודי - Pekoodei which also means “marital relations”, as in the Talmudic statement, “ חייב אדם לפקוד את אשתו וכו ' -A man has an obligation to have marital relations with his wife etc.” The word for marital relations here is לפקוד - Lifkod, which has the same root as פקודי – Pekoodei. Now, the word משכן -Tabernacle refers to the שכינה - Shechinah, which is the Sefirah of Malchut and is the aspect of the last letter Hey ( ה ) of G - d’s four letter"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" (In the above, we again [observe] the aspect of a single Hitbonenut contemplation that includes many particulars in one general point, i.e. from Yesod of Malchut of the Infinite ( Ein Sof ) until the aspect of Yesod of Zeir Anpin . (This is similar to the manner previously described regarding Zeir Anpin in general, which is the end of the wor ld of the Infinite. 47 ) This is in accordance with what is written regarding King Solomon, 48 “ [He spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in the Leb anon to the hyssop that is in the wall. 49 ]” The words “from the cedar tree that is in the Leb anon” refers to the simple essential pleasure that is in the Essence of the Infinite Light when the desire of “I will rule” arose in His simple will. The words “to the hyssop that is in the wall” refers to the aspect of the “small Vav ” , i.e. the immaturity of Yesod of Zeir Anpin , in its influencing and union with Malchut which is called “the wall.” 50 This is as stated, 51 “Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed etc,” and       name. As we see, these words, משכן - Mishkan and שכינה -Shechinah, share the same root. As known, Malchut - Kingship is the source of all worlds, as indicated by the verse, “ מלכותך מלכות כל עולמים – Your kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds”, and as is known, the שכינה - Shechinah is the source of all the souls of Israel. The coming into being of all the worlds and souls specifically comes about through פקודי המשכן - Pekudei HaMishkan - “The impregnation of Malchut ” , which is the unification of the Vav ( ו ) and Hey ( ה ) of G- d’s name. However, this unification, which is the unification of Zeir Anpin and Malchut through the Yesod of Zeir Anpin is only possible if the emotions of Zeir Anpin mature through the influence of Chochmah and Binah upon them. In other words, there must also be משכן העדות - The Tabernacle of testimon y, which is referring to the unification of Chochmah and Binah which are called “ trein rey’in d’lo mitparshin - The two lovers who never separate.” This influence is drawn to Zeir Anpin from the upper משכן -mishkan - tabernacle, which is the upper Shechinah (or the upper Hey ( ה )), i.e. Binah, through דעת - Da’at which is called עדות - Eidoot as in the verse כי אל דעות הוי ' -For HaShem is a G -d of awarnesses. The word דעות - Dei’ot - Awarnesses, has the same letters as the word עדות -Eidoot - testimony. (As known, a testimon y is only necessar y when something is concealed. Thus we see that this refers to the levels Chochmah and Binah which are the concealed world - עלמא דאתכסיא - Alma D’Itkasia - The Concealed World.) (See Likkutei Torah, Parashat Pekudei, Sections 4 - 6.) 47 Chapter 3 3 described a Hitbonenut - Contemplation that unites all the particulars of the Seder Hishtalshelut - The Chaining Down of the Worlds, down to Zeir Anpin, and connects all the particulars to the general whole. Similarly, Chapter 7 describes a Hitbonenut - Contem plation which traces all the levels and particulars of Malchut - Kingship , from Malchut of Ein Sof to Malchut of Asiyah and connects all the particulars to the general whole. It also explains the unification of all the particular levels of Keter - Desire to t he general whole, which is the “Simple Desire in the Essence of Ein Sof ” and chapter 8 deals with the same principle as it applies to Chochmah. Similarly, the same matter may be applied to Yesod. Based on the principles outlined in this chapter one may con template all the details of the chaining down of Yesod and relate them back to the general whole. See chapters 7, 8 and 33. 48 Kings I 5:13 49 The configuration of the ten Sefirot is called by the term, Eitz Chayim - עץ חיים -The Tree of Life. Now, as explained above in chapter 22, the ten Sefirot not only exist as ten general qualities, but rather every single level and aspect is also subdivided into ten and those, in turn, are further subdivided into ten etc. This mea ns that the “Tree of Life” exists on all levels, from the highest to the lowest levels. This is the meaning of, “He spoke of trees (i.e. the ten Sefirot as they exist throughout Seder Hishtalshelut - The Chaining Down) from the cedar tree that is in the Leba non (i.e. from the highest level which is, “The Simple Essential Pleasure that is in Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof - the Essence of the Infinite Light, when the desire of “I will rule” arose in His simple will) to the hyssop that is in the wall (i.e. all the way down to the level of the “hyssop in the wall” which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin as it unifies with and influences Malchut. ) 50 See Zohar Vayechi 228b; Terumah 133a 51 Kings II 20:2"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"likewise it states, 52 “Pray, l et us make a loft with a wall etc,” 53 which refers to Malchut , as stated in the Zohar . This, then, is the m eaning of, “The righteous man sha ll flourish like the palm tree , ” th at is, he ascends to the “seventy years” 54 of Adam Kadmon 55 and there “he will grow like a cedar in the Leb anon ” in an aspect of limitless ness ( Ein Sof ), literally. 56 This will suffice those of understanding. ) (It is also explained elsewhere that Yosef is called 57 “an orphan from his mother”, but not from his father. The [letters of the] word “orphan – Yatom ” ( יתום ) form an acronym for [the words of the verse,] “ [And Yosef was] well built and good looking – י פה ת אר ו יפה מ ראה .” 58   52 Kings II 4:10 53 The word used for “wall” here is “ Keer ”. The Zohar states that in the Greek language Keer means lord. We therefore see that Keer -Wall is a euphemism for the Sefirah of Malchut - Kingdom. This is because the Divine name associated with Malchut is the name א - ד - נ - י – L- rd. This is also the meaning of the verse, “He prayed toward the wall.” Prayer is the act of man connecting with G -d from below. It is the act of ascending to G -d. Since Malchut is the Divine Attribute which is the source of the worlds and is c losest to the worlds, therefore it is the “Gateway of prayer”, so to speak, through which the soul may ascend to higher levels of Divine closeness and awareness. This is why the Amidah Prayer is prefaced by the words, א - ד - נ - י שפתי תפתח ופי יגיד תהילתך – “L - rd, open my lips and my mouth shall utter your praises”. This is also the meaning of נעשה נא עליית קיר – “Pray, let us make a loft with a wall”. The word used for “loft” may also be translated as “ascension” and as explained above, the word for “wall” may also be translated as “L - rd”. Accordingly, this verse could be translated as, “Pray, let us make an ascension by way of the L - rd”. (See Zohar, part one, p. 228. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaRaShaB, of the years 5643 -5644, pg. 310) 54 See Zohar Vayikra 16a; 24a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Shmot Vol. 1, pg. 225. 55 The reason that the date palm is associated with the “Seventy years” of Adam Kadmon is because it takes a date palm seventy years to reach full maturity at which time it produces good fruit. In the same way, as explained in chapter 34, the emotions of Zeir Anpin, that culminate in Yesod, which represents the “Ingathering of all the light s”, need to go through stages of growth until they reach the emotional maturity of, “An elder who has acquired wisdom” from the source of wisdom. The “Seventy years” of Adam Kadmon represent the full maturation of the emotions, through the effect of the in tellect upon them, to the point that the Ratzon L’Ratzon - Desire for the Desire (or self -perception) is totally aligned with G -d, as Pirkei Avot states, “Make His will as your will”, as explained in chapter 30, note 5. (See Zohar Vayikra 16a.) 56 In other w ords, even after the maturation of the emotions to the point of the “Seventy years” of Adam Kadmon ” there may be even further growth, all the way to the “Aspect of limitlessness ( Ein Sof ), literally. This is indicated by the continuation of the verse, “He will grow like a cedar in the Lebanon,” as previously explained at length. 57 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaTzelem ), Shaar 23, Ch. 3. Also see Biurei Zohar, Tisa 54c. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee Bereshit pg. 294, and Na”Ch pg. 118. 58 At first glance, th ese words of the Torah seem superfluous. Of what benefit is the quality of beauty in a man, especially a good and righteous man such as Yosef? The explanation of the matter is that Yosef represents the aspect of Yesod, which in the giver of all influence. He therefore includes all the upper lights within himself. Because of this the Torah says of him that he was beautifully built and beautiful of appearance. Yafeh To’ar - beautifully built, refers to the shape and image, which is the aspect of vessels which d efine and limit how the light and life force will be. On the other hand, Yafeh Mar’eh - beautiful in appearance refers to the beauty of the radiance of the spiritual light and life force within the vessel, which is the form within the substance. Thus the Tor ah is telling us that Yosef was beautiful both spiritually as well as in the physical expression of that spirituality. This is to say that both in the lights and in the vessels, all his qualities existed in the proper proportion of admixture. There was nei ther too much of one characteristic nor too little of another characteristic. Rather, everything was in the most appropriate proportions of characteristics, both in the lights and in the vessels. For example in the matter of his essential goodness a person should neither be excessively good, in which case he will be greatly taken advantage of, nor excessively bad, in which case he will be unsympathetic to the suffering of others. Rather, there should be a proper equilibrium between the two characteristics, both in the essence of the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Now, the reason that “he is an orphan from his mother” is because the aspect of Yesod of Imma is short 59 and withdraws and is concealed during the birth of the emotions. For , as is clea rly observable, the intellect withdraws with the arousal of the emotions. It is for this reason that it states that Binah only spreads forth until Hod of Zeir Anpin , but not until Yesod of Zeir Anpin . 60 That is, it only [spreads forth] until [i t causes] the aspect of the acknowledgment ( Hoda’ah ) which comes about because of the intellect. However, it does not spread forth until Yesod of Zeir Anpin , which is the aspect of the essential connection of the heart within which t here is a glimmer from the aspect of Yesod of Abba . [That is, the aspect of Yesod of Abba ] is the aspect of the connection to the essential light of the concept, prior to its [investment] within the comprehension. Regarding this it states, 61 “ My heart has seen much wisdom etc , ” i.e. [this is] the sight of the intellect within the heart of flesh, in Yesod of Zeir Anpin , specifically. It is the aspect of the sublimation which is drawn forth in the breath of the chest and heart, and as stated in Ra’aya Mehemna , 62 “ With the eye of the intellect , which is in the heart , one can see everything.” This is because the Yesod of Abba is longer than that of Imma , 63 and is drawn forth until Yesod of Zeir Anpin even after the light of Binah is withdrawn. Thus, [ Yesod of Zeir Anpin ] is called “ an orphan from his mother” but not from his father etc ., as is explained elsewhere at length . 64 This is also the matter of,       vessel as well as the spiritual light and life force. The same principle applies to intellect. A person should neither be overly judgmental nor overly gullible. Rather, his perception of others should be with the proper proportio ns of caution and trust. Now, this principle of being beautifully built and beautiful in appearance applies to the recipient as well as to the giver of influence. Because of this, Rachel, who represents Malchut, which is the recipient, as will be explained later, was also called, Yafat To’ar V’Yafat Mar’eh - Beautifully built and beautiful in appearance. In other words, the recipient must accept from Kol - Everything ( Yesod ) in the proper measure, in the most appropriate proportions of admixture and inter - inclu sion of characteristics. Because of this Rachel ( Malchut ) is called Kallah Na’ah V’Chasoodah - A beautiful and pious bride. The word Kallah - Bride ) כלה ( is the feminine form of the word Kol - All ) כל ( . In other words, just as Yesod which is called Kol must have the proper proportions of qualities both in its lights and vessels, in order to give, so too, Malchut which receives from him must also have the proper proportions of qualities in order to receive. Similarly, just as Rachel, who is the recipient, and repr esents Malchut, receives through the proper inter -inclusion and admixture of characteristics, so too, Yosef, the giver of influence, who is the aspect of Yesod, must give the proper proportions of influence which it receives from the upper kindnesses of th e Sefirot that are above it. This is because it the through Yesod that all the upper light and influence, from the highest levels to the lowest level becomes revealed from its state of concealment.

See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Na”Ch 118. 64 The explanation of this matter is as follows; Yesod of Imma ( Binah ) is the transmission of revealed comprehension which is drawn down into the emotions of love, fear, awe etc. until it reaches the vessels for transmitting the emotions, which are the gut emotions of Netzach and Hod . However, Binah only influences down as far as Hod and concludes there . This is to say that beyond Hod, the comprehension which gives “birth” to the emotions, withdraws. Now, the Yesod of Chochmah is intangible and thus is higher than the comprehension of Binah . Nonetheless, as long as the comprehension of Binah is revealed, the essential intangible power of Chochmah to conceptualize remains hi dden and concealed within the broad comprehension of Binah. In other words, Yesod of Abba is hidden in Yesod of Imma. This being the case, the statement that, “The Yesod of Abba is longer than that of Imma ” only applies after the comprehension has withdraw n from the emotions. Then the radiance of Abba remains and descends to"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"“These are the offspring of Yaakov ; ” i.e. the seminal drop of Yesod of Abba [ Yaakov ] is the [source of the] aspect of “ Yosef ,” i.e. Yesod of Zeir Anpin . This will suffice those of understanding.) End of Chapter Thirty -Six       Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which is beyond the reach of Yesod of Imma . This is because the essential power to conceptualize, which is the intangible aspect of comprehension, can descend and g o lower than the reach of the tangible comprehension of Binah. This may be illustrated by the arousal of the emotions. When the emotions, such as love and fear, are aroused, rational contemplation, “flies out the window”, so to speak, and all that is left is love or hate devoid of reason. The comprehension of Binah (Intellectual analysis) is incapable of existing within the emotions as it is in essence, just as we see that it is impossible for a person to descend from intellectual analysis to a state of emo tional arousal and still remain rational. Because of this, as soon as actual emotional feelings are aroused, which is a function of Yesod, the light of intellectual comprehension through analysis, completely withdraws. However, even though the tangible com prehension of Binah can only reach the aspect of acknowledgment ( Hod ) rather than actual felt emotions ( Yesod ), nonetheless, the intangible aspect of Chochmah (Insight) which is higher than tangible comprehension ( Binah ) can radiate even within the felt em otions, which is the level of Yesod. This is because unlike Binah which is compared to the faculty of hearing, Chochmah is compared to the faculty of seeing. In other words, Chochmah “sees” concepts holistically, in a “glance”, so to speak, as opposed to t he “hearing” of Binah which must analyze the many particulars of a concept in order to comprehend it completely, as the saying goes, “One picture is worth a thousand words”. Therefore, Chochmah has the ability to guide the felt emotions. This is the meani ng of the verse, “My heart has seen much wisdom”. This is the “Minds Eye” as it exists in the heart and is called Kavanat HaLev - The Intent of the Heart, as is known that the intent of the heart depends on the light of Abba ( Chochmah - Insight), which is the intangible point of the concept. Likewise, the light of Chochmah descends even further into the vessel of speech ( Malchut ), as will be explained in later chapters. This is called, Chochmah SheBeDibur - The Insight of Speech, which is higher than revealed com prehension in speech. This may be readily observed by the fact that through expressing one’s thoughts in speech it is possible to have new insights, discover novel ideas and expand on the subject to a greater degree than how one originally understood it in tellectually when it was still only thought. This is possible because it is specifically the holistic intangible point of insight ( Chochmah ) which is the foundation of speech, rather than the analytical mind of Binah - Comprehension. This is because the int angible may be drawn down in the same essential manner that it exists above, without having to undergo any transformation, which is not the case in regard to the faculty of comprehension. All this will be elaborated upon with clear explanations and at grea ter length later in the book.

Markel Copyright © 2004 Chapter Thirty Seven We must now understand the matter of the unifications of Yisrael and Yaakov with Leah and Rachel . 1 As known, the explanation of the matter of Leah and Rachel is that they are the matter of thought and speech. 2 This is the matter of the two Heh ’s ( ה ) of the [four letter] name [of G - d,] “ Havayah ” ( י \" ה \" ו \" ה ). 3 This is in a ccordance with what the Zohar states 4 that [in the Song of Songs ], “Solomon explains [regarding] tw o females” , as in the verse , 5 “Come with me from Leb anon [my] bride etc. ” In other words, the first Heh ( ה ) [of the four letter   1 Having explained the Seder Hishtalshelut - Chaining down of the worlds, down to this level , all the way from the original desire of Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof (The essence of the infinite light) to the Ratzon HaKadoom (The Primal Desire), to Adam Kadmon (The Desire of the Desire), to Atik and Arich (The Pleasure and desire for the world of Atzilut ) to Chochmah, Binah and Daat (Insight, Comprehension and Concentration of Atzilut ) to Zeir Anpin (The Emotions of Atzilut ) to Yesod of Zeir Anpin (as explained in the previous chapter), the Rebbe will now begin explaining the transition from the emotions ( Zei r Anpin ) to the faculty of speech ( Malchut of Atzilut ). As previously explained, “ Dvar Melech Shilton - The speech of the King rules”. In other words, when a king speaks, it is tantamount to action. This is because whatever the king decrees with his mouth is immediately put into action. In the same way, the creation of the separate worlds is compared to speech, as we find in the account of the creation in the Torah, that the world was brought about through ten utterances, such as, “Let there be light”, “Let t here be a firmament” etc. Accordingly, the verse states, “ Malchutcha Malchut Kol Olamim - Your Kingdom is the Kingdom of all worlds”. In other words, the coming into being of the separate worlds of Briah, Yetzirah and Asiyah (Creation, Formation and Action) is dependant on the “speech” of the King ( Malchut of Atzilut ) to bring them about. On a more general level, even the coming into being of Adam Kadmon and the world of Atzilut is, likewise, dependent on Malchut of Ohr Ein Sof . However, it must be understood that all these levels do not have any actual existence separate and apart from G -d, whatsoever, just as, even in a human being, his desires, intellect, emotions and thought, speech and action do not at all exist as independent entities, separate and apart from him. There must be an inner, essential identity of the one who desires in order for desire to be. This essential identity is, likewise, the thinker who thinks the thoughts, the feeler who feels the feelings and the speaker who speaks the words and ac ts the acts. If this is the case in regard to a mere human being, then how much more so, is it in regard to the King, King of kings, The Holy One, blessed Be He. Certainly, all of existence, from the very highest spiritual level to the lowest and final lev el, which is our physical and lowly world, is completely bound up to the very essence of G -d, is totally sublimated to Him, and cannot exist independently of Him. 2 See Siddur (of the Alter Rebbe ) Shacharit 60c and 69a.

This is to say, just as the [physical] voice is composed of the physical qua lities of fire, water, and air , so likewise the breath of the heart itself includes the spiritual qualities of fire, water and air . 11 These are the aspects of Chessed , Gevurah , and the intermediate quality [of Tiferet ] which is the air (or vapor ). In other words, [this corresponds to] the aspects of the constri ction and spreading forth of the spiritual breath of the heart. For example, when a person is happy in his heart then there is an aspect of the spreading forth of light [and vitality] in his heart. This is the breath of the Kindnesses ( Chas sadim ). 12 In contrast, when he is depressed there is an aspect of constriction and withdrawal. This is the aspect of the breath of Judgments ( Gevurot ). 13 The intermediary between the two, Chessed and Gevurah , is the spiritual breath which is an intermedia ry composite of both Chessed and Gevurah . 14 This is like the air [or vapor ] ( Ruach ) of the physical breath which is an intermediary composite between fire and water. As is known, thirst results from the element of fire ( Aish ). 15 Similarly, regarding the p hysical voice it states, 16 “My throat was raspy ,” which comes about due to an intensity of the element of fire in the breath of the heart. T he opposite of this is a clear [resonating] voice from the element of   6 Genesis 29:16 7 As known, the three patriarchs and the four matriarchs correspond to the upper lights of Atzilut which are in an aspect of influencer and recipient. The influencer and the recipient are represented as the two G -dly names of 45 and 52 ( Mah and Ban - מ '' ה וב '' ן ). The name Mah - מ '' ה represents the giver of influence and the name Ban - ב '' ן represen ts the receiver of influence. (See chapter one, note 39 and chapter 27, notes 10, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Also see chapter 29, note 16) Likewise, in the relationship of Yaakov with Leah and Rachel, Yaakov is the giver of influence whereas Leah and Rachel are th e recipients. This is the matter of the two letters Hey ( ה ) of G - d’s four letter name about which the Torah states, “The name of the big one was Leah and the name of the little one was Rachel. ” Leah corresponds to the first Hey ( ה ) which represents the level of “thought” and Rachel corresponds to the second Hey ( ה) which represents the level of “speech”. (See Torat Chayim, Prashat VaYeitzeh, pg. 168c) 8 Genesis 27:22 9 See Zohar Bereshit 50b. Also See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Kuntreisim , pg. 308.

Also see Torat Chaim, Bereishit 39d , and footnote 26 there. 12 This is because Chessed (kindness) is the aspect of the spreading forth of influence and revelation. 13 This is because Gevurah (sternness) is the aspect of the withholding of influence and revelation. 14 This is Tiferet which, as explained before, is the synthesis of the two emotions of kindness and sternness to form a completely new emotion of compassion which mediates between them. 15 See Tanya Ch. 3 16 Psalms 69:4"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"water ( Mayim ) of the breath of the heart. The intermediary, which is the vapor ( Ruach ), is an admixture [of the two]. T his is likewise true of [the emotions conveyed in] the intermediate voice which contains an admixture of both joy and bitterness or sadness. It is called , “A delightful voice to the soul ” ; which specifically depends on the proportions of spiritual admixture in the breath of the heart. 17 Similarly, the spiri t of life [and vitality] in the right and left ventricles [of the heart] i s in a constant state of “running and returning” ( Ratzo V’Shoov ) with the heart beat, as known that this too is in an aspect of constriction and spreading forth. (However, here the opposite of the above takes place. For, when the life force [and vitality] enters the heart from the brain then th e heart contrac ts to receive it. On the other hand w hen [the life force ] exits, then the heart spreads forth. 18 This is because the vitality is specifically in a manner of “r unning and returning” etc, 19 as explained in medical books.) Now, all of the above is called “Th e voice that is heard” in speech, i.e. the aspect of the vapor and breath of the speech. This is the aspect of the “voice – Kol ” and “speech – Diboor ” which is mentioned in many places in the Zohar . 20 This is the aspect of the unification of Yaakov and Ra chel . 21 In other words, it is the aspect of the drawing forth of the   17 This is observable in the singing voice. It is specifically a s inging voice which has the “texture” of expressing a whole range of emotions and sentiments all at once, which people find most delightful. Such a voice is much more expressive and moving than a voice which can only convey a single “flat” emotion. It is sp ecifically because it is textured by an admixture of many different sentiments, such as longing and melancholy, tempered with hope and joy, that it can touch the soul to its core in a manner that is far more delightful and memorable than a voice which is m erely beautiful. (Also see Torat Chaim Bereishit, 39d.) 18 The statement here is, “When the life force enters the heart from the brain” and refers to the influx of impulses to the heart from the nervous system rather than the flow of blood entering and ex iting the heart. As known, the electrical impulse of the nerves causes the heart to contract, thus pushing the blood out and with its cessation the heart relaxes, thus permitting blood to enter. 19 This is also in accordance with the verse, “The Chayot [ang els] were running and returning.” (Ezekiel 1:14) Although in this verse the word “ Chayot חיות ( ” ) refers to the Angels who are called “ Chayot HaKodesh ”, nonetheless, the word “ Chayot ” ( חיות ) can also be translated as “life force” or “vitality” ( Chayoot ). 20 In other words, the “voice which is heard” refers to the emotions which may be perceived by the tone of the voice as it is expressed in speech etc. (See Zohar Bereishit 36a, 50b; Noach 74a; Vayera 98a; Toldot 142a, and other places etc.) 21 Yaakov refers t o the external and lower aspect of the emotions, as they are aroused from the externality of the intellect. Rachel refers to the aspect of speech, as will be explained later in the chapter. Just as the physical voice is made up of the three elements of f ire, water and air (or vapor), likewise, the “breath of the heart” ( Hevel HaLev ) also includes these three elements, but in a more refined and spiritual form. These are the heartfelt emotions of kindness ( Chessed ), sternness ( Gevurah ) and compassion ( Tifer et ). This may be understood as follows: When a person is happy, the light and influence of the kindness of his heart ( Chessed ) spreads forth. In contrast, when he is sad, he becomes introverted and reserved. This is Gevurah, which is the lack of the spread ing forth of light and influence. Tiferet, on the other hand, is an intermediary conduct which includes both Chessed and Gevurah. Now, the physical composition of the voice is affected by the emotional composition in the heart. If there is an excess of Gev urah , his voice will have much fire in it and will be dry and raspy. If there is an excess of Chessed, his voice will have much water in it and will be clear and resonant. Tiferet, which is the intermediary between them, will produce a voice which is an admixture of fire and water. According to the composition of the emotions will be the composition of the voice. Thus, it is also clear that a person’s voice reveals the admixture of his or her inner emotions. From the intonation of the voice itself, it is po ssible for one to hear if someone is happy, sad, angry, hurt, joyful, or worried etc. All this applies to the “external voice” (The emotions) which may be heard in the voice, and"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"emotions of the heart that come into an aspect of the vapor and breath of the heart, which is composed of the spiritual qualities of fire , water and air, until it reaches the aspect of th e voice of speech. Now, the aspect of the power of speech is drawn from the cavity of the lungs in the cardiovascular system 22 , and is called 23 “the speaking spirit” ( Ruach Memalela ). (This, then, i s the meaning of the statement in Etz Chaim that Keter of Nukvah of Zeir Anpin 24 adheres to the chest of Zeir Anpin . 25 This is also the meaning of the verse, 26 “Forever , O L -rd, your word stands in the heavens.” 27 It is also in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the verse, 28 “ Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’D aber Davar , ” that the source of the power of speech is drawn from the breath of the heart of Zeir Anpin . 29 It is clearly observable that if [a person’s] heart is depres sed and withdrawn [into itself] then his speech will be minimal, whereas when [his heart ] spreads forth [with joy] his speech will be expansive. This is because the power of speech is dependant upon the breath of the voice in the heart itself. 30 ) Now, as long as it has not been drawn forth from the breath of the heart into speech, as in, 31 “T he heart did not reveal to the mouth ,” then the word of the King has not yet been actualized and brought out from “nothing” to “something”, whatsoever. 32 This is similar to       is called, “The Unification of Yaakov and Rachel . In other words, this is the unification of the external arousal of the emotions with speech. 22 The lungs are considered to be part and parcel of the cardiovascular system. 23 See Targum Unkelos to Genesis 2:7. 24 In other words, Keter of Malchut of the world of Atzilut. 25 Keter of Mal chut, which represents the desire to speak, is rooted in the emotions, in other words “the chest of Zeir Anpin”. See Etz Chaim ( Shaar Mochin D’Tzelem ) Shaar 26, Ch. 3. 26 Psalms 119:89 27 The words, “your word” in this verse refers to Malchut , which represen ts the faculty of speech, and the words, “the heavens” refers to Zeir Anpin, which represents the emotions of the heart, which is in the chest. As expained before, the word Shamayim - שמים (The Heavens) is a composite of two words, Eish - אש (Fire) and Mayim - מ ים (Water), which refer to the two primary emotions of Zeir Anpin, sternness - גבורה ( Gevurah ) and kindness - חסד ( Chesed ), as they are composed in Tiferet . 28 Isaiah 58:13 29 The whole of the verse is, “ V’Cheebadto MeAsot drachecha , Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’Daber Davar - Honor Shabbat by desisting from doing your mundane activities, from seeking your mundane needs and speaking mundane words . ” However, the word “ Chaftzecha – Your mundane needs” shares the same root as the word “ Chafetz ” which means desire. Thus, the second half of the verse, “ Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’Daber Davar ” can be understood to refer to the “desire to speak”. As evidenced from the continuation above (in the chapter), the desire to express oneself in speech is dependant upon the emotions of the h eart. When one is depressed his speech is minimal, and the opposite is true when one is in a state of joy. This, then, is the meaning of the aforementioned statement of Etz Chaim that Keter (the desire) of Nukvah ( Malchut or speech) adheres to the chest of Zeir Anpin . 30 It is impossible to speak without the voice. Only afterwards in speech itself does the voice become divided into the letters of speech through the five organs of the mouth (as will be explained in later chapters at length). (See Ma’amare i Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikrah, Vol. 2 pg. 652.) 31 See Midrash Tehillim 89:1. See also Kohelet Rabba , Parsha 12:10 32 This statement is referring to the fact that as long as G -d has not actually brought something out into the “speech” of Malchut of Atzilut, then actualization does not necessarily have to come about. This is because, as the verse states, “ Dvar Melech Shilton - The word of the king rules” (Ecclesiastes 8:4). In other words, when G -d speaks, so to speak, this brings about an actualization. This is similar to when a king speaks. His word becomes law and is immediately put into action. However, as long as the king is only considering the matter in his heart, or even if he has already come to a decision and resolve about it in his heart, but has not y et “dictated” or “enunciated” it, then it still is not the law and no one would be culpable of rebelling"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"[the statement, 33 ] “ However, [HaShem] did not declare who will be righteous and who will be wicked.” 34 This is because speech is already an actualization, as stated, 35 “ For He spoke, and it was; [He commanded, and it stood fast.]” Similarly, it states, 36 “ The word that issued from my m outh shall not return unfulfilled , [but it shall accomp lish that which I please] etc.” However, while [ it is still] in the “ heart ” of Zeir Anpin it can still be overturned from Judgment ( Din ) to Kindness ( Chessed ), as in the verse, 37 “ And the L -rd repented [that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart] etc.” It then states, 38 “And the L -rd said in his heart, I will not again [curse the ground any more for man’s sake] etc.” This is the aspect of ChaGa”T 39 of the breath of the heart of Zeir Anpin that comes forth and unites with speech, which is called the revealed world, as is known. Thi s will suffice those of understanding. Now, there is an aspect of an inner voice that i s altogether not heard in speech . This is the aspect of the intellect within the emotions of Chessed and Gevurah . For example, this is like the Love ( Ahavah ) and Fear ( Yirah ) which transcends the aspect of the spirit of vitality ( Ruach HaChayim ) that is in the heart, like the essential joy and love of kindness or the essential anger and judgment of fear and trepidation. These are much more spiritual, even more than the spiritual compositions of fire, wate r and vapor mentioned above , which comes to be composed in the physical heart. Now, although this itself 40 ha s a composition of [the a spects of] fire, water and air – whi ch are the aspects of Chessed, Gevurah and Tiferet , nevertheless it is with in the inner aspect of the heart. That is, [it refers to] the aspects of ChaGa”T 41 within which there is a radiance of the intellect . [This radiance of the intellect] is called the inner voice of Binah within Zeir Anpin , 42 which comes and is drawn from the brain to the heart. 43       against the king if they did not act upon it. This is because, “The heart did not reveal it to the mouth” ( Zohar Hashmatot 253a). In other words, it wa s only determined in his heart and did not yet come out into an actual decree. ( Also see footnote 34 and the references there.) 33 See Tractate Niddah 16b. 34 Whether a person will be righteous or wicked is given over to his own free choice. G -d has not dec reed it. Had G - d actually, “said” who would be righteous and who would be wicked, these natural tendencies would be so strongly engraved in us that it would be literally impossible to overcome them. It would, therefore, not be possible for G -d to hold us r esponsible or accountable for any of our deeds, whether good or evil. Thus, there would not be a purpose or “mission” for man to fulfill in the world, and there would be neither be reward nor punishment. This would go against G - d’s ultimate purpose in crea ting the world, since G - d desired that human beings should be free agents who can freely “choose” to serve Him or not to serve Him. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Dvarim, Vol. 1 pg. 223. Also see Torat Chaim , Bereishit 30d, and footnote 19. Also see Torat Chaim, Bereishit 155c and on. Also see Shaarei Teshuvah 18a.) 35 Psalms 33:9 36 Isaiah 55:11 37 Genesis 6:6 38 Genesis 8:21 39 This is an acronym for Chessed, Gevurah and Tiferet . 40 This refers to the intellect of the emotions, which is the inner “unheard voice”. 41 The emotions. 42 That is, the comprehension and understanding of Binah (which receives from the point of Chochmah ) as it is invested in the emotions of Zeir Anpin. The matter of the investment of the light of the intellect within the emotions (a nd the various different ways and levels within this) has already been discussed at length in previous chapters. 43 The Rebbe will now begin to explain the various particular unifications of Zeir Anpin and Nukvah ( Yaakov and Yisrael with Leah and Rachel ). Since the aspects of Yaakov and Yisrael were explained at great length in previous chapters (thirty -four and thirty -five), the general explanation should be self"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" Thus, when [this intellect] is drawn forth by way of the aspect of Da’at - which is the aspect of Yisrael , which was previously explained - and causes a spiri tual arousal [of the emotions] which is immediately drawn forth into the letters of thought, which is called Leah , this is what is called a unification of Yisrael and Leah . This is to say, the innerness of the emotions of the heart immediately become thou ght about in his mind. [For example,] s hould he become aroused by an intellectual [point] and reasoning for love and kindness, then this emotion and the intellect that is within it will come into [the letters of] his thoughts. [This is so] s ince, as is k nown, the thoughts enclothe the emotions of Yisrael and their particulars. [These thoughts] are called Leah ( לאה ), as in, 44 “ Nil’ah – It is weary ( נלאה ) of containing the emotions. 45 The source of Leah is above in Binah . 46 The verse therefore states regard ing Leah , 47 “I have born him six sons,” referring to the aspect of the six directions of the emotions of Zeir Anpin . However , the unification of Yisrael and Leah refers to the intellect of Abba and Imma as it is within Zeir Anpin , which unite with the lowe r Leah , i. e. the [letters of] thought which receives from the aspect of Malchut of Tvunah , which is the source of thought etc. 48 This will suffice the understanding. Now, there is also a unification of Yisrael and Rachel , which is when the radiance of the innerness of the intellect as it is in the emotions , comes into speech. Likewise, there is a unification of Yaakov and Leah which is called “the fleeting thoughts of the heart” ( Hirhurei Liba ). In other words, this is when the aspect of the ex terna lity of the emotions rises up as fleeting thoughts in the brain.       understood at this point. Nevertheless, the general analogue and inner intention for all of t hese analogies will be explained at length at the end of the chapter. 44 See Likkutei Torah of the Arizal , End of Parshat Toldot . Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch , pg. 105. 45 The reason why the level of “thought” is called Leah, which is a term t hat denotes weariness, may be understood by how thought occurs in a human being below. As we observe, thoughts constantly go through a person’s mind without cessation. Not a moment passes without thoughts arising. This involves everything that he desires a nd contemplates, even in trivial matters that have no importance, including everything that his eyes see or his ears hear. Not a moment passes without fleeting thoughts running through the mind. This even takes place during sleep in the form of dreams. Bec ause of this, the mind has no rest and becomes weary of thoughts, which is not the case with speech. Speech is much more under the conscious control of a person and, therefore, one can go for long periods of time without speaking. (See Torat Chayim, Paras hat MiKeitz, pg. 169a -170a) 46 There reason why it is specifically thought that has this characteristic of never ceasing is because the source of thought is Binah, which is compared to a river. In other words thought is like the waters of a river which f low ceaselessly and are constantly renewed from their source in the spring, just as the tangible comprehension of Binah is constantly replenished with the intangible insights of its source in Chochmah. Because of this Chochmah and Binah are called, “ Trein Rey’in D’Lo Mitparsshin -The two lovers who never separate”. (See Torat Chayim, Parashat VaYeitzeh, pg. 170a. Also see Likkutei Torah of the Arizal , Parshat Vayeitzeh , (the Sod – Mystery of Yaakov and his two wives).) 47 Genesis 30:20. Also see Ma’amarei A dmor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch, pg. 188. 48 It must be understood that since Leah represents the letters (or vessel) of thought, there are therefore two levels in Leah : The first level is the upper Leah, which is the letters of pure thought . This is thought as it exists above the emotions. In other words, these are the letters of thought of pure intellect unconnected to emotions (but which gives rise to the emotions, as explained in previous chapters). The second level represents the letters of thought when the inne r emotions of the heart are thought about in the mind. In other words, these are the letters of the thought that result from the emotions. (See Torat Chayim, Parashat YaYeitzeh, pg. 170a -171a.) The aspect of Malchut of Tevunah will be explained later at length."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" So also , there is a unification of Yaakov and Rachel , which is the drawing forth of the externality of the emotions of the heart in to speech, as mentioned above. Now, the order of the drawing fo rth is sometimes as follows; The aspec t of the emotions of the heart rise and unify with thought, and from thought they come [down] to the externality of the heart – which is the breath of the heart – and from the breath of the heart it enters into the bre ath of speech, which is called the voice and speech. At other times, thought enter s speech, like a person who says what he thinks (in his intellect) . This is referred to as, 49 “The heels of Leah entering into the head of Rachel .” During this time, in whi ch he speaks what he think s, it comes out from the voice of the breath of the heart into speech, through the five organs [of the mouth] . 50 Now, certainly, what is in his heart arises into his thoughts, for there can be no thought without the emotions of th e heart. We therefore find that the aspect of Yaakov – which is the vapor and breath of the voice of the heart – functions both in thought and speech , which are called the two sisters , Leah and Rachel . As is known, [these two aspects are sometimes referr ed to as, 51 ] “The concealed world – Alma D’Itkasia, ” and “The revealed world – Alma D’Itgalia , ” 52 [and are also referred to as, 53 ] “The closed utterance – Maamar Satoom ” and “The open utterance – Maamar Patuach .” This will suffice the understanding. (In the same manner there likewise is a unification of Yisrael and Leah and a unification of Yisrael and Rachel in the innerness of the emotions, in the aspect of the afor ementioned “inner voice.” This is the meaning of the verse, 54 “Day to day speech streams for th ,” and then afterwards [in the following verse which refers to thought ,] “There is no speech, ” i.e. in thought, “ there are no words; [their voice is un heard. ] ” This [ latter unification refers to the unification] during Shabbat , [at which time] the u nifi cation is in the innerness of Zeir Anpin and Nukvah , as is known, and as is explained elsewhere. 55 Th is will suffice the understanding.)   49 See Etz Chaim ( Shaar Leah V’Rachel ) Shaar 38, Ch. 3. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 35. 50 The five organs of the mouth are the throat, palate, tongue, teeth and lips. These are the organs that divide the voice into the particular letters of speech, as will be explained in later chapters at length. 51 See Zohar ( Sitrei Torah ) Vayetze 152a; Va’era 29b. Also see Etz Chaim ( Shaar HaMochin D’Tzelem ) Shaar 23, Ch. 4. 52 In other words, since thought is hidden in the brain, it i s called the concealed world. Speech, however, is the revelation of that which is concealed. It is for this reason that the verse (Genesis 29:18) states, “And Yaakov loved Rachel ,” specifically. For although Yaakov (the external emotions of the heart) ma kes use of both the faculties of thought ( Leah ) and speech ( Rachel ), nevertheless, the emotions of the heart desire to be expressed and drawn forth into actual revelation, in speech specifically, which is the aspect of Rachel . (See Torat Chayim, Bereishit , pg. 168b) 53 See Tractate Shabbat 104a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Shmot Vol. 1, pg. 213. Also see Shaarei Teshuvah 91b. 54 Psalms 19:3. Also see Siddur (of the Alter Rebbe ) Shacharit L’Shabbat 181a and on. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken, H anachot HaRav Pinchas, pg. 3. 55 As stated above, in note 1, this chapter begins explaining the transition from the emotions ( Zeir Anpin of Atzilut ) to speech ( Malchut of Atzilut , which also is called Nukvah and Rachel ). It was also explained there that the speech of a king is tantamount to action, because what a king decrees through speech comes about in actuality. Therefore, we see that in the Torah , the creation of the world is described in terms of G - d’s speech. However, it must be understood that there are several levels of speech, each of which indicates a"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"       different level of G -d in His relationship to His world. For example, within speech itself, there are two general levels. These two levels are called, קטנות שבדיבור - Katnoot SheBeDiboor - Diminished Intellect in Speech, which corresponds to the unification of Yaakov and Rachel, and גדלות שבדיבור - Gadloot SheBeDiboor - Expansive Intellect in Speech, which corresponds to the unification of Yisrael and Rachel . Fo r example, the aspect of diminished intellect in speech is similar to what may be observed in a human being, that at times he will speak with a much diminished intellect. This is because his speech is completely separate and apart from the intellectual lig ht and grasp of his mind, so much so, that he could almost be described as speaking without thinking. In other words, his Daat - Concentration, and awareness are not closely associated to his speech, to guide his words with his mind’s eye in every detail. On the contrary, he does not invest his mind and heart into what he says. Rather, he says whatever comes to his mouth, without discernment or awareness. This is similar to a person who speaks frivolously, about things which have no actual pertinence or bea ring on his life, and which, furthermore, have no particular value, in and of themselves. Certainly, when he speaks of these matters, he does not invest his heart or intellectual concentration into them, but rather says whatever comes to his lips, without deliberation. This is so much so, to the point that he almost pays no attention to the words issuing from his mouth. The reason for this is because, even in his own estimation, these matters are inconsequential and are not worth the effort of putting his h eart and soul into it, to be discerning in his choice of words. Therefore, he does not choose his words according to deliberate intellectual reasoning and analysis. Still and all, his words must contain some intellect in them, for, after all, they are not totally nonsensical and he speaks them in somewhat of an orderly fashion. If they did not contain any intellect in them whatsoever ; they would be without rhyme or reason and would be so far removed from normative conversation that we would consider them to be quite insane and confused. Rather, we must say that there is a small degree of Da’at - Intellectual Concentration and lev - The Emotions of the Heart, invested into his speech, even when he speaks frivolous words. However, it is a very external and supe rficial investment. In other words, his mind is invested in it only in a very passing fashion, like a person whose mind is deeply occupied on an important topic, and in the middle of his studies someone reminds him about a trifling matter. On the one hand, since he considers it to be a distraction from his deep contemplation, he does not wish to concentrate on it. However, he does gloss over it briefly in his mind’s eye, even while his inner interest is still engrossed in the important topic. Now, this phen omenon is common to everyone, including even the wisest of men. When he must deal with a matter which he regards to be insignificant or superficial, then, except for a small trace of interest, he will talk about it without investing too much of his attenti on and concentration and without putting his whole heart into it. Now, even though due to this small trace of intellectual interest, he does not cross the bounds of what is regarded as normative speech, such as talking total nonsense or insanity, nonethe less, to a certain degree superfluous words do fall into his speech. These excess words are called פסולת ונובלות דברים -Dross and fallout, since they contain no intellect within them and are quite unnecessary to the subject at hand, like excess chatter. As known, the tendency to chatter excessively is specifically found amongst people of light or shallow attention span and concentration ( דעת קל - Da’at Kal ). However, people who have a greater ability to concentrate ( Da’at ) will be more deliberate in their word s and will try to speak only those words which are necessary to the subject, without deviating and going off on tangents. What causes these superfluous words is lack of attention and intellectual investment when speaking. Nonetheless, in a person of great wisdom, even the dross and excess which falls into his speech when he talks about mundane matters will not be as superfluous as the words of a person who is not wise. This is in accordance with the Talmudic statement that we can learn even from the mundane conversations of the sages. In other words, even when they speak about mundane matters we can recognize the wisdom of their words, and though they themselves regard these words as being superfluous, nonetheless, to a person of lesser wisdom they contain great meaning and insight. This is because the mundane words of a sage contain greater wisdom than the well thought out words of an average person. Now, the above level of speech (in other words, Katnoot SheBeDiboor - Diminished Intellect in Speech, which c orresponds to the unification of Yaakov and Rachel ), is analogous to the level of interest and investment that G -d puts into the ten utterances by which the world is created. Since G -d absolutely"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"       transcends the world and is the only True Being whose existe nce is intrinsic to Him, therefore, in and of Himself, He has no actual need to create the world, altogether. He creates it because He chooses to rather than because He must. This means that as far as He is concerned, the entire existence of the world and even of the ten utterances which bring everything into being, is quite mundane and superfluous, and He invests very little of Himself into it. However, from our angle, the creative power of these ten utterances is so enormous and beyond our comprehension t hat we cannot even begin to fathom the incredible depth and greatness of their power and importance. Now, the second level of speech is Gadloot SheBeDiboor - Expansive Intellect in Speech, which corresponds to the unification of Yisrael and Rachel . This is similar to when a person speaks words of wisdom or very great and important matters or if he has to speak before a king, a judge or a great sage. Under such circumstances he will weigh his words carefully in his mind’s eye, with great concentration of his heart and mind. He will scrutinize exactly how to speak, taking great care that none of his words go against his ultimate purpose and that one part of what he says does not contradict another part. He will also be careful that no superfluous words, which h ave no bearing on the subject, pass his lips. Now, certainly, the intellectual scrutiny which he invests in his speech must come from a much higher level than the specific concepts which he expresses. In other words, it comes from the depth of the power of intellect - Koach HaMaskil, as it exists in and of itself. This is the power to conceptualize all concepts and reveal them from their state of concealment. Likewise, it is the source of the ability to scrutinize one’s words so that they express the depth of the concept. Additionally, this ability to scrutinize becomes invested in his speech in a way of close connection and bonding. In other words, the power to conceptualize, bonds with all the specifics of his speech. When this is the case, he will speak with great exactitude. All his words will be very clear and in accordance with the depth of the concept. Not one word will be superfluous. We, therefore, find that his speech actually ascends and becomes attached to the very source of intellect. Thus, his intellect comes into his speech with an absolute bond. Now, this phenomenon is literally the opposite of the above mentioned level of diminished intellect in speech. There, no intellectual investment and scrutiny takes place altogether. On the contrary, the speech is separate and apart from the intellect and the intellect only radiates in a very superficial and hidden fashion. Furthermore, its source in the intellect is only the external thought of the intellect, rather than the inner essence of the inte llect. The opposite is true of words of wisdom and important matters. Here, the essential light of the intellect bonds with his speech, to guide all his words with great scrutiny, so that there is clarity in the expression of his thoughts. Furthermore, the re will be no excess words. Because of this, his words will be as brief as possible, so as not to deviate from the point. (However, sometimes it is impossible to express a deep concept without lengthy explanations. This is the aspect of the Yesod of the Male, which is called, “ Lashon Limoodim - The Tongue of Instruction”. However, even in these lengthy explanations there are no superfluous words. On the contrary, the lengthier the explanation of more and more details of the concept, the clearer the concept becomes. His lengthiness is, therefore, purposeful, because the ultimate point of the concept had not yet been clarified by his earlier statements. The purpose of the latter statements is to complete what was missing in the earlier statements.) Now, what was said above concerning the two levels of speech as they exist in man is analogous to G - d’s “Speech” in His relationship with His world. As known, the aspect of “Diminished Intellect in Speech,” (The unification of Yaakov and Rachel ) is called “The six “ mundane” days of the week” and is the aspect of the combination of the many letters and words which branch out of the ten creative utterances of G - d’s upper speech. This is understood from such verses as, “The heavens were created by the word of HaShem ” an d “The word of the King rules” etc. In this level of “Speech”, the intellect invested in the combinations of letters and words is extremely diminished. This is because the principal purpose of these combinations is to bring about the creation of something out of nothing. As explained above, relative to G - d’s essential light, in other words, from His point of view, so to speak, this is very superfluous and insignificant. Therefore,"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" End of Chapter Thirty Seven       relative to Him it is called, “ Millin D’Hedyota - Mundane matters” ) מילין דהדיוטא ( . This is similar to a great sage when he speaks of mundane matters. Now, as mentioned above, superfluous and excessive words “fall out” from this type of speech. These are the lowest combinations of letters of the world of Asiyah from whi ch the “Seventy Genies” of the nations ( Shiv’im Sarim ) receive their influence. In other words they come about because of the tremendous diminishment of the G -dly intellect in the speech that creates them. They only receive in an aspect of a tiny trace ele ment ( Reshimu ) and a “glossing over” of the attention ( Ha’avara B’Alma ). Since this is considered to be like the “dross” ( Novlot ) of speech, therefore the external forces ( Kelipot - Shells) receive the life force from there. However, this only applies to th e “fallout” of this level of speech. The higher combinations of the unification of Yaakov and Rachel , which are not completely superfluous and are, therefore, not yet like “dross”, remain unaffected by the external forces of Klipah (The shells), as the ver se states, “I will not give of my Glory to another”. This is because as long as there is a radiance of the intellect of Chochmah - Insight , even if it is only a tiny glimmer, it is not given over “to another”, in other words, it is not given over to the Sitr a Achera (The Other Side, i.e. the side of evil) from which the Kelipot - Shells receive their sustenance. This level of the speech of G -d applies to the six mundane days of the week which correspond to the six millennia of “This World - Olam HaZeh. However, such is not the case in regard to the holy day of Shabbat, which corresponds to “The World to Come - Olam HaBa and is called, “ Yom SheKooloh Shabbat - An era which is all Shabbat”. On Shabbat, Malchut ascends to a higher level of perfection. In other words, th e faculty of speech ascends from a state of diminished intellect in speech (The unification of Yaakov and Rachel ) to a state of expanded intellect in speech (The unification of Yisrael and Rachel ). This is the second above mentioned level in which speech i ssues forth with the utmost intellectual scrutiny. This is because in regard to Shabbat it states, “It is not the way of the King to be preoccupied with mundane matters - לאו אורחא דמלכא לאשתעי במילין דהדיוטא . The “mundane matters” referred to here are the ten utterances by which the world was created. As stated above, relative to G -d these ten utterances are mundane and superfluous to His existence. This, then, is the meaning of the verse, in Isaiah 58:13 that during the day of Shabbat one should desist fr om, “Seeking his mundane needs and speaking mundane words”. It is specifically then that the essential power of insight ( Chochmah ), which is higher than revealed intellect, strongly connects and bonds with speech. Therefore, on Shabbat speech ascends to the inner light of Abba ( Chochmah - insight ) of Atzilut as it is invested in Zeir Anpin (The emotions) of Atzilut. This is called the expanded intellect of Abba in Zeir Anpin. Because of this strong bond between the intellect and speech, therefore, there ar e no excess superfluous “words”. Therefore, the Kelipot and the Sitra Achera do not receive any sustenance whatsoever. This is why it states in regard to Shabbat, “Kol Dinin Mitabrin Minah - All judgments are removed from her.” This is also why it states abo ut the World to come (Isaiah 35:8), “ Bilah HaMavet LaNetzach - Death will be swallowed up forever.” (See Pirush HaMeelot pp. 37b -40a.)"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Shaar HaYichud The Gate of Unity By The Holy Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch Translated and Annotated by Shimon Markel Edited by Rabbi A.

In other words, though the mouth and larynx share a certain similarity to string instruments, however, the letters of speech do not receive their essential existence through the vibra tion of the larynx and the formations of the lips, teeth, tongue, palate and throat, similar to how the sounds of a string instrument are totally dependent on and come about as a result of strumming the strings of the instrument. Actually, the opposite is true. The physical sounds of the letters which issue from the mouth are dependent on preexisting letters. In other words, the letters precede the physical sounds of speech and are their source, rather than vice versa. This is evidenced by the fact that w hen a person desires to speak, such as to say the letter Beit ) ב ( or the letter Peh ) פ ( , through our observations we find that the lips move in response to the expression of the letters and that it is specifically the expression of these letters which causes the movement of the pursing of the lips. If the reverse was true, that the existence of the letters comes about from the lips, then the pursing of the lips would precede. However, such is not the case. Rather, the Beit ) ב ( and the Peh ) פ ( were already prepared to come out, and it is this which causes the lips to mo ve, thus bringing out the revealed letters of speech. This principle applies to all the letters of speech. The letters activate the five organs of the mouth, like an axe in the hand of the woodchopper or like a pen in the hand of the writer. This is beca use, unlike the eyes, which, by nature, are prepared to receive the spiritual power of sight, or the ears, which, by nature, are prepared to receive the spiritual power of hearing, the nature of the mouth does not necessarily to bring out the power of spee ch. In other words, by their very nature, healthy eyes see and healthy ears hear etc. However, this does not hold true of the mouth. A healthy mouth does not by nature have to speak."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"       A further proof of this is that if the origin of the letters of speech was in the organs of the mouth themselves, like the sounds of a musical instrument, such as a violin or a piano, then the primary focus in learning how to speak would be to concentrate on how to properly purse the lips to bring out the letters Beit ) ב ( Vav ) ו ( Mem ) מ ( and Peh ) פ ( or how to properly move the tongue to bring out the letters Dalet ) ד ( Tet ) ט ( Lamed ) ל ( Nun ) נ ( and Tav ) ת ( etc. This would be similar to how one learns to play a piano, in which the primary focus is on how to hit the proper notes on the keyboard to achieve the desired sounds. However, as known, this is not how a child learns to speak. He does not focus on how to move his lips, tongue or palate, at all. Rather, he concentrates on what he wants to say , without giving thought t o how to move his lips or tongue, and the combinations of the letters come out by themselves, automatically. All this is ample proof that the five organs of the mouth from which the letters issue, are not the source and origin of the letters, but are onl y the vehicle by which the letters of speech are revealed. Rather, we are forced to say that the letters are drawn from the spiritual essence of the soul and that the letters are embedded in the soul, which is full of letters in a heyulie way. Because of t his the human soul is called Ruach Memalelah - The Articulate Spirit, or Nefesh HaMedaberet - The Speaking Soul. Furthermore, it is called by these terms even when it is disembodied and does not possess a mouth or a larynx (as will be explained later in the ch apter). A further proof to all of the above may be understood as follows. Although the letters of speech come out from the five organs of the mouth (throat, tongue, palate, teeth, and lips), nonetheless, their actual source is not in these organs. For, after all, an infant and a mute person also have these organs, yet they are nevertheless incapable of speech. Likewise, an animal also has a tongue and lips, yet it too cannot speak. Rather, the source of the letters is that they are embedded in the soul in the way of a heyulie . It is not merely from the revelation of the soul, for then you would have to say that each thought has its letters which are specific to it. However, we find that this is not the case, for we see that two Sages can express the s ame concept and thought using different letters. Rather, the source of the letters is in the essence of the soul, that “the soul is filled with letters.” This refers to the Heyulie power to speak itself, as it is in the essence of the soul (similar to ho w the Heyulie power for all the particular movements is in the power of movement of the essence of the soul, as explained in chapters 10 and 11 etc). This is also evidenced by the terminology of Sefer Yetzirah 2:2 where it states about the letters, “He set them in the mouth.” That is, their source is in the essence of the soul and they were merely “set in the mouth,” and become invested in these five organs of speech. It is through this that the letters become concrete and tangible letters of speech. It is self understood that the letters that issue from these five organs of speech are not comparable to the letters as they exist in the soul, just as the physical movements of the body are not comparable to the Heyulie power of movement, as it exists in the soul. Nonetheless, these are the very same letters that are in the soul. They are drawn down from level to level, until they become invested in these five organs and become tangible letters of speech. From the above we may understand how it is in G -dliness, in the upper speech of Malchut of Atzilu t, that the source of the letters is in the Essence of the Infinite Light that preceded the first Tzimtzum lessening. Now, as the letters are in the Essence they are heyulies and are not “tangible” or “fel t” letters whatsoever. For, w herever there is a revelation of Light ( Ohr ) there is a diminishment of the sense of “something - ness” ( Yeshut ). However, when there is concealment and Tzimtzum of the light then the aspect of the “something - ness” ( Yeshut ) bec omes more apparent and felt. In relation to the letters this can be understood by the letters of speech which are much more apparent and tangible than the letters of thought , to the point that they are perceivable by others . In contrast to the letters of speech , the letters of thought are much more refined and spiritual, so that they are not apparent or perceivable by others at all. One is able to thin k all sorts of thoughts in his mind and his fellow will not be aware of these thoughts at all. It is possible that he will not even be aware that his friend is even engrossed in thought. Nevertheless, he himself “feels” and is aware of these letters of thought. However, there are letters that are even higher than the letters of thought. For, even in th ought itself there are two aspects. There is the externality of thought, which is when he is thinki ng in letters and they are tangible and felt by"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"       him in a manner of “something - ness”. However, t here is al so the aspect of the innerness or depth of thought , which is when he is thinking into the actual depth of the concept itself and there is a revelation of the light of the intellect in a much stronger and more revealed way – so that the “letters” of the thoughts are not felt at all. Nonetheless, they are s till there. An example of this is when a person has a flash of insight from the aspect of Chochmah , in which he is focused and aware only of the light of the concept that radiates in his mind. During this time he is completely focused on the intellectual light of the concept, and the letters of the concept are not felt at all. We find that this is similarly the case with the power of desire ( Ratzon ) and the power of pleasure ( Taanug ). There are letters there as well. However, because of the great stre ngth of the light of the pleasure, the letters are not felt at all . Nevertheless, we must say that there are letters there. However, they are very ref ined and not felt. Similarly , there are letters in the essence of the soul, in that the “soul is filled w ith letters”. For, as previously explained, although the revelation of the letters comes from the five organs of speech etc, nevertheless, their primary source is in the light of the soul itself. Thus, even though it is possible that one is lacking in hi s ability to bring forth these letters into revelation (like a mute or an infant etc), nevertheless, he still has these letters in the essence of his soul (which is why he is able to give birth to a child who will be capable of speech, as explained previou sly in regard to a blind person and his ability to give birth to a sighted child. This is because the blind person possesses the heyulie of the power of sight and can therefore transfer it to his child). Another proof for this is from the fact that, as mentioned above, two individuals can express the very same intellectual concept or thought in different manners, with different “letters”. If we were to say that the source of the letters is in the revelation of the soul itself (i.e. in the intellectual c oncept) then the expression of this concept should be equal in both individuals, and they would, of necessity, express the concept in exactly the same “letters”. However, we observe that this is not the case, and that two individuals can express the same concept in different letters. For example, in the Talmudic commentaries of the Tosefot, the Ro”Sh and the Ra”N etc, they often are all expressing the same matter through different letters. It is therefore necessary to say that the source of the letters is not from the revelation of the soul, but is in the essence of the soul itself. Now, just as the light of the concept becomes revealed from the soul, so likewise the letters become revealed from the soul. We therefore find that there is an existence o f “letters” in the essence of the soul, and in the revelation of the powers of the soul etc, and even in the powers themselves, such as pleasure, desire etc, all the way until the aspect of speech. However, we find that the more essential the letters are, the more refined they are, and that as they descend and are drawn down from level to level into revelation, the more tangible and physical they become. In the essence of the soul the letters are not felt to have any existence whatsoever, until their de scent into the faculties of the insight of Chochmah and the comprehension of Binah, wherein they become more tangible compared to their previous state. Nevertheless, as the letters exist in Chochmah and Binah they are still very refined and spiritual, and are only felt by oneself, but not by others, until they finally issue forth into revelation through the power of speech etc. That is, the letters become more and more tangible and physical as they descend to lower and lower levels. The reason for this is as stated above, that commensurate to the degree of revelation of the light of the soul, to that degree is the concealment of the tangibility of the letters, so that they are not felt and perceived, and commensurate to the degree of concealment of the lig ht of the soul, as it descends from level to level, to that degree is the revelation of the tangibility of the letters, so that they are more felt and perceived. Thus, in thought, where there is more of a revelation of the soul, the letters are more refin ed and spiritual. In the depth of the thought (or the flash of insight mentioned previously) the “something - ness” of the letters is felt less, as there is a greater revelation of the light of the soul. In the very essence of the soul where the essential light of the soul radiates in a totally revealed way, there is no revelation of the letters whatsoever and they are not tangibly felt in at all.

They are included within it essentially, just as the power of movement is included in the animal etc. 7 Now, they come out and burst forth into revealed thought o n thre e levels. There is imagination and imagery with no letters whatsoever. 8 There are simple letters that are disordered [and jumbled,] not forming combinations or connecting to any particular matter. Then t here are the letters that are combined according to [organized] analytical thought. 9 Likewise, in the essence of the soul there is [also] the aspect of the letters of speech. It is thus called , 10 “The Articulate Soul – Nefesh HaMedaberet ” or “The Speaking Spirit – Ruach Memalela .” They [too ] are included there in an essential manner, and come out into revelation lik e the movement of an animal, or the like. This is like the speech of the Angels 11 , about which it is stated, 12 “ They call one to another [and s ay] etc.” In this there are likewise three levels. There is the simple substance of each particular letter. This is called the breath of the spirit of speech. Then there are the individual uncombined letters of Aleph ( א ) , Bet ( ב ) , Gimel ( ג ) , Dalet ( ד ) etc. Then there is the combination of the letters which i s called the form of the speech in the “speaking spirit”. 13 This is similar to , 14 “ T wo spirits conversing,” and to the speech of the Angels etc. 15   6 This is to say that just as we explained that the source of the letters of speech are in the essence of the soul, so likewise the source of the letters of thought are also in the essence of the soul. Th e general difference between thought and speech is that thoughts are to oneself, while speech is expressed to another. Therefore, just as these two aspects exist in their revelation, it is necessary to state that this is likewise the case in their source. That is, the matter of the letters of thought is that which is unto himself while the letters of speech, even while still in their source, is that which is to be revealed to others. (See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5666, p. 483. Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5665 pg. 195. Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Vayikra , Vol. 2, pg. 922 -924. ) 7 In other words, as the Rebbe explained in above in Chapter Ten, even though in the soul of an animal there is no actual movement, nonetheless, in a way of a heyulie it contains the heyulie power for all possible movement. It could, therefore, be said of the soul of the animal that it contains all possible movements within itself. Now, in the same way, the human soul possesses additional heyulie abilities over and above what all othe r creatures possess. These are the heyulie for the letters of thought and the heyulie for the letters of speech. It may, therefore, be said of the human soul that it is filled with letters. Even though no actual letters exist there, nonetheless, it contain s the heyulie powers for all possible letters of thought and all possible letters of speech to come out. 8 It was just stated that the letters come out and burst forth into revealed thought on three levels. This being the case the statement that the le vel of imagination and imagery has no letters, whatsoever, makes no sense. However, it must be understood that even on the level of imagination there most certainly are letters. Otherwise, it would be impossible to bring out the imagination from its heyuli e state into a revealed state, since it is specifically the function of the letters to reveal. However, on this level all that is perceived is the imagery of the imagination, rather than the letters which reveal it. Therefore, on the level of the imaginati on it is as if there are no letters whatsoever. 9 These three levels will be expounded upon at greater length in chapter forty -one. 10 See Genesis 2:7; and Targum Unkelos there. 11 See note 15 below. 12 Isaiah 6:3 13 In Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh , Epistle Five thi s is explained as follows: The letters have two (general) aspects of form ( Tzurah ) and substance ( Chomer ), which are the inner and external aspects of the letters.

However, only after the coming into being of the desire do [ these letters] come out to be the aspect of the revelation of the desire. T hey ar e then called “the letters of the desi re”. This is the aspect of the revelation of the desire as a “somethi ng” with a tangible existence as a desire, this being the principal matter of the letters of the essence of the soul. That is, they only are the asp ect of the revelation [and expression] of the light of the essence of the soul in every aspect and manner of “something - ness” and tangible existence.

However, the aspect of the “matter” ( Chomer ) and “body” of their formation, which is their externality, is the breath. 14 The Talmud ( Brachot 18b ) relates the following incident: It happened that a certain Chassid (pious man) gave a dinar of charity to a poor man on the eve of Rosh Hashanah during a year of famine. His wife was angered over this, so he went and spent the night in the cemetery. W hile he was there he heard two spirits of two deceased children conversing with each other. One said to the other, “My friend let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come upon the world this year.” Her friend replied, “I cannot come with you, as I am buried in a reed mat. You go, however, and come back and tell me whatever you hear.” So she went and roamed and returned. Her friend said to her, “What have you heard from behind the curtain?” She replied, “I heard tha t the crops of anyone who plants this year at the time of the first rains will be destroyed by hail.” Hearing this, the Chassid went and planted at the time of the second rain. Everyone’s crops were destroyed except for his. The next year he again went and spent the night in the cemetery, and he heard the same two spirits talking with each other. One said to the other, “Let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come to the world this year.” She replied, “My friend, di d I not already tell you that I cannot come with you because I am buried in a reed mat? You go and come back and tell me whatever you hear.” So she went and roamed and returned, and her friend said to her, “My friend, what have you heard from behind the curtain?” She replied, “I have heard that the crops of anyone who plants this winter at the time of the second rain will be blasted by a dry wind.” Hearing this, the Chassid went and planted at the time of the first rains. Everyone else’s crops were bla sted except for his. His wife said to him, “Why is it that last year everyone else’s crops were destroyed by hail except for yours? And why is it that this year everyone’s crops were blasted except for yours?” So he told her the whole story. It was not more than a few days later when a quarrel broke out between the wife of the Chassid and the mother of the child whose spirit was overheard in the cemetery. In the course of that quarrel his wife said to the mother, “come I will show you your daughter bur ied in a reed mat etc.” The next year he again went to spend the night in the cemetery, and heard the same two spirits conversing. The one said to the other, “My friend let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come to the world this year.” She replied, “My friend, leave me be. The words that we spoke between ourselves in the past few years have already been heard amongst the living.” 15 This is a further proof that it is the soul that is the source of the letters. Fo r, the soul is full of the letters that are embedded in it in a spiritual manner. It is for this reason that it is called a “speaking spirit” ( Ruach Memallela ). This is true even while it is not invested in a body and is lacking the five organs of the mouth. Nevertheless, since the power of speech is an essential power of the soul, we therefore find that it is present even in disembodied souls, such as the ex ample given in note 14, or in angels. ( Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Vayikra , Vol. 2, pg. 923.) (Perhaps it was specifically to make this point that the Rebbe chose to cite an analogy of speech as it exists in spiritual beings, such as disembodied souls ans angels, rather than citing an analogy from a living human being.) 16 See Tanya, Shaar HaYichud V’HaEmunah , Ch. 11 -12, and Iggeret HaKodesh , Epistle 5."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"It is through this [the m atter of the letters] that it is possible for the desire to come into revelation in the ligh t of the intellect. If not for the revelation of the desire in an aspect of letters, i.e. that [by means of the letters] it appears as a ta ngible existence of desir e, then the essential concealed desire would not come into any other garm ent, from one state of being to another state of being . [This is to say, there would be no descent into the] aspect of a desire which is felt and revealed in the “ intellect and reaso ning for the desire ” , as is known. This will suffice the understanding. 17 This is similarly the case with the intellect and reasoning for the desire, which is called Chochmah of the desire ( Ratzon ). The fact that it appears as a tangible existence of “re asoning for the desire” is from the asp ect of the letters that are in it. It is through this [i.e. the matter of the letters] that it descend s from [its] state to the state of emotions of the desire. An example of this is [the aspect of] love ( Ahavah ) tha t is within the desire. It too is only the existence of desire, except that it is vested wi thin the existence of love, that because of his desire he love s etc. ( Ahavah – Love ( אהבה ) shares the same root as Avah – Desire ( אבה ), 18 and the Heh ( ה ) [which is additional to the root , represents] the “Five Kindness es - Heh Chassadim ” which spread forth from Chochmah and Binah etc.) Now, this desire itself, even as it is in the intellec t and reasoning for the desire , still refers [only ] to the essence of the desire as it transcends [actual ] intellect and reasoning. Nevertheless, it is through the letters that it transforms and is seen as transcend ing the intellect, to [being] within the intellect, to [being] within the emotions. Similarly, there are letters for the emotions as well. This refers to the fact that the love that is within the desire has an apparent tangible existence etc. This continues until the aspects of thought, speec h and action of desire. Each of these has the aspe ct of letters, all the way to the aspect of the desire for action, i.e. when the action arises in his desire. 19 There are specific letters for this. This is likewise the case with the [actual] intellect that follows the desire. For if the intellect did not have a [tangi ble] existence in letters of intellect, which is the aspect of the revelation of the intellect as a [tangible] existence, then how would it be possible for the intel lect to come forth wit h a transformation of being to an [emotional] arousa l of love which is born of intellect? For, even there [in the emotional arousal] it is the [very] same intellectual [point] that there was prior to the birth [of the emotion ] of love. It is only that [no w this intellect]   17 This is to say that if not for the letters there could never be a transition from the state of pure ess ential desire to the state of the intellect and reasoning for the desire. In other words, there could not be a transition from Keter of Keter to Chochmah of Keter. The same principle holds true for all subsequent states of existence, all the way down to ou r physical world. It is specifically the matter of the letters that makes the tangible revelation of all these states of being possible. 18 See Shoresh Yesha, section on Avah ( אבה ), brought down in Sefer HaChakirah , 92a. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee , Hanachot 5577, pg. 264. Also see Sefer HaShorashim of the RaDa”K , section on Avah ( אבה ). 19 In other words, what is spoken of here is not action itself, but rather the desire for the action, which is the action level within desire itself, because, up to this point the Rebbe has only spoken in regard to the different levels in the chaining down ( Hishtalshelut ) of the desire itself. Only in the next paragraph does he begin to talk about the actual level of the intellect, which is the next level after the d esire."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"vests within the [emotional] existence of love. This is only possible by means of the letters that are within it. Likewise, it is in this manner that the letters of the emotions [come] into thought. If the emotion did not have a tangib le existence of letters, how could it possibly vest within the existence of thought etc.? The same is true of the letters of thought within speech etc. We find that it is through the letters that there is an aspect of a chaining down from cause to effect , from the essence of the soul until the end action, and that the source of the letters is literally in the essence of the soul. It is also understood from all of the above that in the source from which the letters are hewn , i.e. in the e ssence of the sou l, the letters come into being as one with the essential light of the soul. This is similar to how the power of movement [of an animal ] comes into existence with it [i.e. the existence of the self of the animal] etc , and the like . This will suffice those of understanding. Now , the analogue to all this is automatically understood: That is, the letters of the Upper Purity ( Tehiru Ila’a ) about which it states, 20 “He engraved an engravin g,” refer to the aspect of the e ssential letters of thought and speech i n the Essence of the Infinite Light ( Ohr Ein Sof ). This is analogous to the letters which are embedded in the essence of the soul, in the Yechidah , o n the three above mentioned levels . These letters chain down from one state of being to another state of b eing, such as from the simple des ire of “I will rule” which arose in His thought before the Tzimtzum , until even the desire, intellect and emotions of Adam Kadmon , Atik Yomin, Arich Anpin, Abba and Imma, Zeir Anpin and Nukveh of Atzilut . All this is drawn forth and descends from one to the other in a manner o f cause and effect with a transformation from one state of being to another state of being, by means of the aspect of the letters of e ach of these states of being. For, this [i.e. the matter of the let ters] is the aspect of the revelation of the “something - ness” [of that state of being,] giving it tangible existence, as explained above. [This continues ] until the aspect of the “end action” of Malchut of Atzilut , which is the aspect of the letters of ac tion of Malchut of Atzilus , and continues [even further ] until Malchut of Malchut of Asiyah , [which is ] the root of the existence of our lowly wor ld (as will be explained at the end of this tr eatise ). This is all included in the verse, 21 “ [Everything that the L -rd desired, He has done. ” That is,] “Everything that the L - rd desired” in His Essence “He has done” in actuality. This will suffice those of understanding. End of Chapter Thirty Eight   20 See Zohar Bereishit 15a. 21 Psalms 135:6"}]
