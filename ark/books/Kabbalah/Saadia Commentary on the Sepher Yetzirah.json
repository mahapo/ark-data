[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Saadia Commentary on The Sefer Yetzirah by Saadia ben Joseph al-Fayumi (882-942 AD) Jewish scholar, b. Egypt. He was known as Saadia Ga on. He was the head of the great Jewish Academy at Sura, Babylonia, which under his leadership became the hi ghest seat of Jewish learning, and a vigorous oppon ent of the Karaites (A Jewish fundamentalist schismatic sect, reputedly founded (8th cent.) in Persia by Anan ben David and originally known as Ananites, but after the 9th cen t. they were called Karaites. The Karaites attacked the Talmudic interpretation of the Bible, rejected the oral law and - in the usual way of fundamentalists everywher e and everywhen, interpreted the Bible literally). Saadia 's Book of Language laid the foundation of Hebrew g rammar; he also wrote a Hebrew dictionary, the Agron, and made an Arabic translation of the Old Testament that be came the standard version for all Arabic-speaking Jews and e xerted an important influence upon Muslims as well. He also compiled the first comprehensive siddur (daily pray erbook). His great philosophical work is The Book o f Beliefs and Opinions (tr. Samuel Rosenblatt, 1948). Writing in a period of spiritual doubt and confusion, Saad ia attempts in this work to defend Jewish religious faith on the b asis of rational argument, using the methods of Isl amic speculative theology known as kalam. The first defense of Judai sm in rational terms, Saadia's work laid the basis for all subsequent Jewish philosophy. Index 1.

On the Origin of the World According to the Pythagoreans & the Sefer Yetzir ah ... The seventh system belongs to the theorist who admits a creation of things, but asserts that the f irst things created were numbers. By means of numbers, substances and p articles are differentiated. Geometry and figures a re based on number, for all created things necessarily have som e kind of form. According to this theory, the figur e of the created object precedes the object itself, for it is the ob ject's material. However, if this theorist - may Go d have mercy upon you! - supposes the potential, and not actual, ante riority of numbers to numbered things, then we must accept this as a just and irrefutable theory. We maintain that the number, in potentiality, has prefigured the number ed object; that the form has preceded the formed thing; the figure, the figured thing; geometry, the geometrical body; and composition, the thing composed - all in potentiali ty and not in actuality. But if this theory posits the actual anteriority of pure numbers, isolated compositions, and abstract theorems, the supposition is inadmiss ible for two reasons: (1) the theory implies that the Mover and the moved were joined by a third thing: motion; wit h the forming agent and the formed object, it names another objec t: form; and along with the Creator and his creatur e, it posits a necessary third: creation. This is absurd; (2) it i s contradictory to speak of abstract composition an d pure theorem, for these are necessarily based upon at least two t erms. The eighth system belongs to the theorist who accep ts a creation, but ascribes the origin of things to numbers and letters. This theory belongs to the author of this book. In fact, he ascribes the origin of the Creato r's creation to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"thirty-two things: the ten numbers and twenty-two l etters. He does not say, however, that they are abs tract and isolated. He only says that God has created the air and has established the thirty-two things in it. T he numbers, according to him, traverse the air, which is compos ed of distinct particles. When the air current foll ows these direct and inflected lines, it produces figures. After exa mining this theory, we find these points to be corr ect, but they need to be completed by the following exposition. The sa me applies to the letters. When their creator estab lished them in the air, they were cleaved, and figures of diverse appearance and geometrical forms were created accor ding to the faculty of each isolated letter, two letters combin ed, or one compound of numerous letters. Our rabbis say something similar with regard to the scene at Mt. Sinai in the Scripture, for it is sai d: \"And all the people saw the thunderings,\" [Exodus XX, 15] . The rabbis asked how it was possible to see sound s? They explained that the Sage brought a powerful and brilliant fire down upon the mountain, as it is said: \"Because th e Eternal descended upon it in fire,\" [Exodus XIX, 18] . Then He surrounded it with a black cloud, \"and th e mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness,\" [Deuteronomy IV, 11] . This darkness is the black cloud, as it is said: \"He made darknes s his secret place; his pavillion round about him w ere dark waters and thick clouds of the skies,\" [Psalms XLVIII, 12] . Thus did He create the scintillating voice in the fire; the voice emanated from fire and its form appeared in the clo ud according to the impulsion given by the pronunci ation's movement in the air. The people saw this form and k new then that the fire's scintillation had projecte d it into the surrounding black air, as it is said: \"And the Eter nal spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire,\" [Deuteronomy IV, 12] , and it is said: \"when ye heard the voice out of t he midst of the darkness,\" [Deuteronomy V, 23] . As an example of this, we see that when someone speaks on a cold day, the articulation of the voice cuts the air and produces forms varying in straight or inflected lines according to the current which the sounds follow. Similarly, th e author says that numbers and letters are the origins of things; he m eans with the air, as we have just demonstrated. 2. On the Divine Epithets and the Aristotelian Categories What do the ten names of God enumerated at the begi nning signify and why does the author limit himself to one? The names of God, like the names of all beings, ref er to actual or alleged events. In the Ma'aseh bere shit [Work of Creation] , God is called Elohim, the name of essence. He is not called Eternal [Adonai, Yod-Vav-Yod] before the creation of the creatures, because to be Lord, He m ust be the Master of someone. The Sages have said: \"He has mentioned a full name for a full world,\" [Beresit Rabba, XIII] . He is called El Shaddai [\"Almighty God,\" Genesis, XVII, 1] when He orders Abraham's circumcision and says: co unt on me who helps and saves. He called Himself \"I am that I am,\" [Ehyeh asher ehyeh, Exodus III, 14] when He produced the miracles and marvels like the phenomena of creation, the ten pla gues and the rest. He is the One who realizes but c annot be realized. He called Himself Yah [Yod-He] when He produced the extraordinary miracles on the Red Sea. He called Himself Elohim Hayyim [\"Living God \"] when He revealed His voice to the people and they heard, and did not die but were given life, as it is said: \"For who is the re of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the li ving God,\" [Deuteronomy, V, 26] . He called Himself Adonai Sabaoth [\"Eternal (or Lord) of Hosts\"] when the people's pilgrimage and assembly in the sanctuary was recoun ted, as it is said: \"And this man went up out of hi s city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Eternal of hos ts in Shiloh,\" [I Samuel I, 3] . He is called High and Extolled [Ram v'Nisah] when Isaiah speaks of Uzziah, king of Judah: \"In t he year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sittin g upon a throne, high and lifted up,\" [Isaiah VI, 1] . On account of Uzziyahu, he has said: \"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgress ed against the Lord his God,\" [II Chronicles XXVI, 16] . He called Himself Lord [Adon] when He announced that He would raise the noble am ong the people, for it is said: \"For behold the Lord, the Lord of Hosts doth take way fr om Jerusalem,\" Isaiah III, 1]. He is most often cal led Eternal God [Yod-Vav-Yod Elohim] in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and not Eter nal of Hosts [Yod-Vav-Yod Tsvaot (Sabaoth)] because Israel's legions had been dispersed and Hi s totality had been fragmented. When the Israelites gathered in the second temple, He called Himself Et ernal of Hosts, and this appellation is always used in the prophecies of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Only once is He called Eternal God of Israel. This is in the verse: \"Let him send her away saith the Eternal, the God o f Israel,\" [Malachi II, 16] . This name can be understood in a general and a restricted sense. In the restricted s ense, the law of divorce can be applied to the Isra elite only by another Israelite, and not by the pagans. If the pa gans compel the divorce, it is nullified. In the ge neral sense of the word, it refers to the Lord's possession of Israel. Though Israel has been chased and exiled, the Lord has neither abandoned nor forsaken her, but considers her His o wn. He has been called \"changeth the times and the seasons,\" [Daniel II, 21] when He transforms the era of domination into one of servitude. He has been called \"He removeth kings and setteth up kings,\" [Daniel II, 21] when He dethroned Sedecias and made Nebuchadnezzar king. He has been called: \"He giveth wisdom unto the wise,\" [Daniel II, 21] because He taught wisdom to Daniel. He has been called \"He revealeth the deep and secret things\" [Daniel II, 22] for He revealed the nature of vision to Daniel."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Finally, it is said: \"And Esdras blessed the Lord, the Great God,\" [Nehemiah VIII, 6] , for God has said: \"The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the f ormer,\" [Haggai II, 9] . The names of angels correspond in like manner to ev ents which are the angel's task to realize. When Go d dispatched angels to Abraham to announce the glad tidings, the y resembled and were thus called \"men\" [anashim, Genesis XVIII, 2] . When God sent the angels to destroy Sodom, they w ere called \"angels\" [malachim, Genesis XIX, 1] . When God sent them unto Isaiah to burn him with hot coal because he neglected to warn Israel, they wer e called \"seraphim\" as it is said: \"Then flew one of the ser aphim unto me having a live coal in his hand....and he laid it upon my mouth,\" [Isaiah VI, 6-7] . When Ezekiel saw them in the form of unreasoning animals, they were called \"hayyot\" [\"creatures,\" Ezekiel I, 5] . The angels between them, which turned not when th ey went, were called \"ophanim,\" [\"wheels,\" Ezekiel I, 15] . The most elevated between them have been called \" cherubim\" [Ezekiel X, 1] because each elevated being among men is called \"cherub,\" as it is said of the king of Tyre: \"Thou wast the annoint ed Cherub that covereth,\" [Ezekiel XXVIII, 14] . The names of the celestial bodies vary according to their different characteristics. The one with a br ight light in the center is called \"bright\" [or \"luminary\"] as it is said: \"All the bright lights,\" [Ezekiel XXXII, 8] , according to the term for the Sun. The star with lesser brilliance i s called \"Nogah\" [\"shining\"] after a name for the Moon, as it has been said: \"neither for brightness shall the moon g ive light unto thee,\" [Isaiah LX, 19] . Nogah is also the Hebrew name for Venus. Stars with a hot nature are called \"Kesilim\" [\"constellations\" and \"Orion\"] , as it is said: \"For the stars of heaven and the constellations\" [Isaiah XIII, 10] . This refers to the name Orion, which is Kesil and its fires. Luminaries with a cold nature are called Mazzaroth [\"Pleiades\"] , as it is said: \"Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his seasons?\" [Job XXXVIII, 32] . Israel's different names of praise such as Jacob, Israel, and Jeshurun [Deuteronomy XXXII, 15] ; and her different names of blame like \"M'shuva\" [\"backsliding,\" Jeremiah III, 6] , \"B' gedah\" [\"treacherous,\" Jeremiah III, 8] , \"Oholah\" and \"Oholibah\" [Ezekiel XXIII, 4] correspond to particular events. These names of the angels, luminaries, and the nation are an interpretation of actual characteristics. The n ames of the Creator, however, are only indications and extracti ons [abstractions] of his powers - may He be praised and exalted! The author of our book intends to show us how the e xistence of beings is realized. When the wise grasp ed this knowledge, they discovered the ten and only ten cat egories which reason can use to order all things: s ubstance, quantity, quality, relation, space, time, possessio n, position, action, and passivity. When the sages precisely established these ten categories, no conception rem ained unconnected to them except the idea of the Cr eator, for He is above all intuition and comprehension. Therefore , our author has enumerated these ten categories at the beginning of his book in a style befitting the rest of his ex position. The name Yah refers to substance [essence] for the author translates it as Eternal, and he derives it from th e word hayyot [being or creature] and \"hayu\" [\"they have been\"] . This name applies to eternity, and God is the Creat or of all substances. The name Eternal Sabaoth [Eternal of Hosts] corresponds to the categories of action and passivi ty. The Eternal is active, as it is said: \"I am the Eternal that maketh all things,\" [Isaiah XLIV, 24] . The passive, which is great in number, is called \"legion\" [host or armies] . The name Living God [Elohim Hayyim] refers to Elohim as the Creator of quantity, for t he measure of life (i.e., age) is a quantitative measure. The name El Shaddai [\"Almighty God\"] refers to God the Creator of quality, for the name Shaddai [Shin-Dalet-Yod] derives from \"dai\" [Dalet-Yod, \"sufficient\"] and \"daim\" [Dalet-Yod-Mem, \"sufficiently\"] . The name Elohei Israel, God of Israel, refers to re lation. The name Lofty [Ram] refers to God as Creator of the Good, while the name Nisah [\"elevated\"] refers to the category of position. The name Shokh en Ad [\"dwelling in eternity\"] indicates the time before and after which He is; a nd finally, the epithet Qadosh Shmo [\"Holy be His Name\"] refers to the category of possession and to the no ble attributes which allow our intelligence to reac h an approximate idea of Him. Therefore, the ten names c learly suit the ten categories, and according to ou r author, there remains nothing which God has not created. After a deep examination and detailed analysis, we conclude that the Ten Commandments heard by our fat hers before Mt. Sinai correspond to these same ten categ ories which encompass every precept. The commandmen t \"I am the Eternal\" alludes to the category of action, as it is said: \"I am the Eternal that maketh all thing s,\" [Isaiah XLIV, 24] . The commandment \"Thou shalt have no other gods... \" refers to substance, for it adds: \"that is in hea ven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the w ater under the earth.\" The commandment \"Thou shalt not take (the name of the Lord in vain) refers to quality since m ost oaths only apply to modes of being. The command ment: \"Remember the Sabbath day\" explicitly relates to th e category of time. The commandment: \"Honor thy fat her and thy mother\" is the relation itself. The commandment : \"Thou shalt not kill\" indicates the category of p assivity, as it is said: \"for in the image of God made He man\" [Genesis IX, 6] . The commandment: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" designates the category of position, for this act i s a kind of position and contact. The commandment: \"Thou shalt not steal\" directly corresponds to possession. The comm andment: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness\" refers to quantity since most false witnessing applies to measurement. Finally, the commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet\" i ndicates space and everything corresponding to it; thus the Sage adds: \"the house of thy neighbor.\" Therefore, the decalogue"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"clearly comprehends all the notions in the world. B y the same token, the 613 precepts must therefore b e contained in the decalogue without exception. By co-ordinating these precepts in accordance with the Ten Commandments, I have discovered that 80 pre cepts correspond to the first commandment, 60 precepts co rrespond to the second commandment, 48 correspond t o the third, 75 to the fourth, 77 to the fifth, 50 to the sixth, 58 to the seventh, 59 to the eighth, 52 to the ninth, and 54 to the tenth. This amounts to 613. There are 620 letters i n the decalogue, of which 613 correspond to the 613 precepts. The remaining seven letters are contained in the two co ncluding words: \"that is your neighbor's,\" but they are already subsumed in the words immediately before them: \"nor anything\" [Exodus XX, 17] . Blessed be the Sage who put so many things in so few words! The words [from Sefer Yetzirah] \"He created His world in three sefarim\" indicate t he three ways of recording all things. The sages counted four aspects: substance, word, writing or thought. For example, we see a man in substance; or we say the word: \"man\"; or we write t he letters: M A N; or we represent an image of the man in thought. Now why does our author only enumerate thr ee aspects of a thing? He calls them \"three sefarim \" [\"three books\"] or \"three divans,\" and these are: scripture, numbe r and word. When the category of substance is added to them, they comprise the four aspects. Substance and thought do not vary. Viewed according to these two categories, the object makes the same impression on all men. Th e other two aspects, scripture and word, do vary, f or we see many different languages and scripts. However, the ideas underlying these are not different. 3. On the \"Closed\" Numbers, Mothers, Doubles, & Simples: The author then explains the thirty-two paths, and says that these are ten numbers and twenty-two lett ers. We translate the word \"b'limah\" as \"closed.\" The prope r sense is: 'provided with a brake,' as it is said: \"whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,\" [Psalms XXXII, 9] . The author then divides the letters into \"three f undamental mothers\". The sense of the word [Alef-Vav-Mem, ôm] is \"mother\" and this is a term in the Mishna. It i s said: \"There is one mother for the tradition and one mother for the reading\" [Pesahim 6b; Sukkah 6b] . This means that the Law has been interpreted in two ways: according to the principle of the Scripture and according to the pri nciple of oral lecture. The word [ôm] is called the primitive origin of the body part wh ere leprosy resides, as in the passage: \"either the primitive origin of the wound has disap peared or dimished\" [Nega'im, I, 5] . Using this metaphor, the author says \"three fundamental letters\" [yesod gimel otiot] . The proper sense of the words \"sheva k'phulot\" is \" seven doubles,\" for it is said that there are two k inds of knowledge: \"the secrets of wisdom, that they are do uble to that which is\" [Job XI, 6] . This is the knowledge of the Creator and the knowledge of the creature. There ar e also two kinds of punishments: \"for she [Jerusalem] hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins \" [Isaiah XL, 2] . These are the punishments in person and fortune, of the sacred and the profane, for the king and the multitude, and among the distinguished and the vul gar. The words \"shtem esre ph'shutot\" indicate the \"twel ve simple\" letters. With respect to composed object s, isolated and separate things are called \"simple\" to distingu ish them from compounds, as it is said: \"a simple y ear\" to distinguish it from the embolismic year. The simple year is of twelve months, the embolismic year has thirteen months. One also says \"first born\" and \"simple\". \"F irst born\" refers to two parts, and \"simple\" to one part. In astronomical charts of complex years, this is an ap proximate measure of a certain star's revolution. T he simple years are the average of its progression through each sol ar year. Since the seven letters are double, the re maining letters are called simple to distinguish them from the comp ound. 4. On the Creation's \"Witnesses\": \"By means of these [32 paths] , the Eternal, Master of armies, God of Israel, liv ing Elohim, Almighty, Unique, Lofty and Dwelling in Eternity, Holy Be His Name has trac ed three mothers and their progeny, seven chiefs an d their armies, and twelve limits of the angle. Proof of th is is given by the trustworthy witnesses: the unive rse, the year and the person [soul] . To each applies the rule of ten, three, seven and twelve and their correspondents: the sphere, the Dragon and the heart. [Chapter One, ¶4] . I translate \"fathers\" [avot] as \"mothers\", for as I have previously stated, the words: fathers, mothers, principals, materia prima, initial substance, etc. all have the same meaning. I translate the word \"kobeshin\" as \" chiefs\" because they conquer countries, as it is said: \"And shall c onsume the earth before the Eternal,\" [Deuteronomy XXXII, 22] . Elsewhere it is said: \"of all the nations which he had subdued,\" [II Samuel VIII, 11] . I translate the words \"g'vulei alakson\" as \"limit of the angles\" because this is t he sense of the words frequently found in the Talmu d. There it is said: \"every cubit forms a cubit and two-fifths in diagonal\" [Baba Batra, 101 b] . This means that the diagonal is one"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and two-fifths cubits in every square with a simple side of one cubit, though this is not quite correc t. The exact measure of the diagonal is the square root of two. Tali [Tav-Lamed-Yod] can be defined as the dragon. I understand this to be the place where two orbits intersect [the orbit of the sun and the orbit of the moon] like the equator and the sun's orbit. Actually, th e circle of the sun's orbit is inclined twenty-three degrees and a fraction to the circle of the equator. When we suppose that the tw o orbits are aligned, they necessarily intersect at two opposite points. One of the two points is called the spring equinox and the other, the autumnal equinox. Just as the solar and lunar orbits intersect one another at two opposite points (each point called \"dragon\"), one of these points is some times called the head, and the other, the tail. Thi s explains the origin of the dragon's name. It is not a constellat ion resembling a dragon or any other creature. \"Dra gon\" refers to the coils and curves which it forms when one sphere is positioned in the north and the other in the so uth. The Hebrews have given it a similar name, since it is s aid: \"By his spirit hath he garnished the heavens; His hand hath formed the crooked serpent....\" 5. On the Geometrical \"Whirlwind\" of the Hebrew Letters: \"The ten closed numbers are ten and not nine, nor e leven; understand in wisdom and ponder them in inte lligence; know, reflect and believe; situate the thing accord ing to its evidence and establish the Creator accor ding to its quality. The numbers correspond to ten infinities, whose beginning flashes like lightning; but one fin ds no end to them when searching for their limit; and the decree of the Creator made them like angels who ran and r eturned; and they pursue his decree like a whirlwind, and it is as if they would prostrate themselves before his th rone.\" [Chapter Two; ¶ 1.] Of the two statements which follow the three propos itions, the first is: \"His decree is with them, and they ran and returned.\" The author's meaning is that every time the numbers arrive at ten, they return and begin ag ain eternally and without limit for us, as it is also said of the angels: \"And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning\" [Ezekiel I, 14] . They return and then depart again, and it is as i f they had been stationary, as it is said: \"Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, here we are?\" [Job XXXVIII, 35] . They have faces on all sides, and thus it is said: \"And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, a nd another angel went out to meet him,\" [Zechariah II, 3] . It is not said that the angel appeared \"behind hi m\" because the angel presents a face every direction it turns. Like the numbers, the letters also always repeat themselves, following and succeeding without an end for us. The second of the two statements is: \"And they purs ue his speech like a whirlwind.\" The author's inten tion here is to emphasize how the letters and numbers are formed in the air. He says that the whirlwinds describe figu res and forms in the air, and though they all differ, they are st ill all circular. Among their material forms, some are more oblong, others combine circle and square, others combine ci rcle and triangle, some are composed of superimpose d spheres, and still others are composed of interpenetrating s pheres. All of these are types of whirlwind. This a nalogy explains how the letters and numbers are formed and have spr ung into the air; and this is why it is said: \"The Eternal hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm,\" [Nahum I, 3] ; and also: \"For behold, the Eternal will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind\" [Isaiah LXVI,15] . Ezekiel demonstrated this with respect to the oph anim and the hayyot; the circles [or 'wheels'--trans.] interpenetrate like tubes within tubes. The same t hing can be said for the junction of whirlwind within whirlwind and tempest within tempest. Thus it is clear that God - be He c elebrated and exalted - has revealed the lights of the hayyot and the ophanim which have circular forms. The prophet s were also shown winds which have the same circular forms, as it has been said: \"Then the Eternal answered Job ou t of the whirlwind\" [Job XXXVIII, 1] , and elsewhere: \"out of the whirlwind\" [Job XL, 6] . If one has properly comprehended the formation of the letters in the air, this will not seem difficult. As for the saying: \"They prostr ate themselves before His throne,\" [it only alludes to the numbers and letters obeying him and executing his decrees. The word \"prostrate\" should not be understood in the literal sense.... 6. On the Rotation of the Letters and the Zodiac: \"When we say that it is by means of these media tha t the Eternal, Master of hosts, God of Israel, Livi ng Elohim, Almighty, Sufficient, Noble and Sublime, Dwelling i n Eternity, Holy Be His Name has traced the twenty- two letters according to the construction of the sphere, we ref er to the sphere's rotation which displaces to the rear what was positioned to the fore. It is the same with the let ters when one inverts them, putting to the rear wha t had been at the fore. Proof of this is demonstrated when one says ' oneg' ['delight'] which is something desirable, and when one says 'nega' ['plague'] which is something detestable: the letters are the same, only inverted.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This verse is the pivotal point of the book, namely that the Creator - Holy Be His Name - has so dispo sed some of the letters and numbers to create a kind of body. L ater He transposed their positions in order to crea te a body different from the first. The author gives us two c omparisons drawn from the rotation of the sphere an d the rotation of the letters. More examples could be adduced, but we will begin with these two. If the three letters : Het, Tsadeh and Resh are combined, their meaning in this order is \"courtyard.\" If we change the position of the Ts adeh and Resh, pronouncing the word harats, its meaning becomes \"t o cut.\" If we combine the letters in the order of R esh, Tsadeh and Het, which is pronounced retsah, the meaning is changed to 'murder'. If we combine the letters in the order of Tsadeh, Het, and Resh, this is then pronounced tsoh ar and means \"whiteness\". These four words are exam ples of the same letters used in different order. Sometimes the different ways of combining letters do not have a significance. If the letters Qof, Shin and Resh are combined in this order, they signify qashar, \"to bind.\" If they are recombined in the form of Qof, Resh and Shin, or qeresh, the mean ing is \"beam.\" The same letters combined as sharaq means \"hiss,\" and the combination of Resh, Shin and Qof i s pronounced reshaq and means \"happiness\". There is , however, no meaning to the combination of Resh, Qof and Shin in this language. A word with four letters multipl ies the number of possible combinations just as a word with five letters multiplies them even more so. It is especially clear to anyone versed in the scie nce of the sphere's revolution. When the sphere tur ns the measure of one zodiacal sign, diverse figures result which bri ng a corresponding influence into play, according t o the data of this science. Let us examine the represented image of the sphere for this present day, which is Tuesda y, the twelfth of Sivan in the year 1242; the Sun was at the 7° of Gemini, the Moon at the 2° of Scorpio, Saturn at t he 14° of Capricorn, Jupiter at 25° of Pisces, Mars at 40° of Pisces, Venus at 25° of Cancer, and Mercury at 20° of Taurus. If we begin our work in the first and second hours of the day, the most powerful luminaries in the celest ial sphere are the Sun at the horizon and Jupiter and Mars since t hey are both in the middle of the sky. The four oth er planets are hidden since Venus is in the 2°, the Moon in the 6° , Saturn in the 8° and Mercury in the 12°. Everythi ng under the influence of the first three is strongly effected b ecause their light falls on the horizon. The influe nce from the four other planets is weak because the horizon does not receive their light. If we do our work during the t hird and fourth hours of the day, the celestial sphere has already turned one sign. Cancer is on the horizon, the Moon is at the 5°, Saturn in the 7°, Jupiter and Mars at 9°, Mercury a t 11°s. The influence of each of them depends upon its force from its position. If we do our work during the fifth an d sixth hours of the day, two signs have turned and Leo is on the horizon. The powerful luminaries in the sphere are the Sun because it is in the 11°, Mercury at 10°, a nd the Moon at 4°. As for Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, they ar e all hidden, and those under their influence will feel their effect. If we conduct our work during the seventh and eight h hours of the day, a quarter of the sphere will ha ve turned, Virgo will be at the horizon and none of the planet s will be hidden. The Moon will be at 3°, Saturn at 5°, Jupiter and Mars at 6°, Mercury at 9°, Venus at 11°. In this ca se, all the influences compliment one another. If w e are working in the ninth and tenth hours of the day, one animal of the sphere will have turned. Scorpio will appea r along with the Moon, and the sphere will take another form accordi ng to its revolution. The influence of the rays, th e horoscope and other astronomical conditions are subsequently transformed as the sphere revolves. Fixed stars, ch anging stars, and stars which have two bodies likewise demonstrat e this transformation during each quarter of the da y (which begin anew each six hours). I have drawn out these examples only because the author has stressed them by saying: \"the sphere turns forwards and backwards.\" 7. On the Ethereal Realm and its Relation to Prophecy: The Holy Scriptures call the second, more tenuous a ir Kavod [\"glory\"] , as it is said: \"the whole earth is full of His glory\" [Isaiah VI, 3] ; and God Himself has declared: \"But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Eternal\" [Numbers XIV, 21] . The people call him Shekhinah [\"dwelling\" or \"abode\"] as it is said: \"And the glory of the Eternal abode\" [Exodus XXIV, 16] , and elsewhere: \"that glory may dwell in our land\" [Psalms LXXXV, 9] . The author of our book has called Him \"breath of the Living God\" as it is said: \"And my spirit will remain in the midst of thee, that thou fearest not,\" [Haggai II, 5] . Via this second, tenuous air, the word of prophec y was delivered, as it is said: \"The Spirit of the Eterna l God is upon me\" [Isaiah LXI, 1] . It is also via this second, tenuous air that all the visible miracles appeared to the p rophets, as it is said: \"in a vision by the Spirit of God\" [Ezekiel XI, 24] . This is evidently a created thing, for everything outside the Creator - may His Name be exalted! - i s a created thing, as it is said: \"there is none other beside H im\" [Deuteronomy IV, 35] . By way of this second, tenuous, but created air, which is in the world as life is in ma n, the created word heard by Moses in the visible a ir has been produced along with the decalogue heard by our fath ers. This has been called: \"voice of the living God \" [Deuteronomy V, 26] . Through the voice of the living God, the seven qu alifications of the voice of the Eternal were spoken. From this second air comes the knowledge of wisdom, which God bequeaths to distinguished men, as it is said: \"And the spirit of the Eternal shall rest upo n him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"council...\" [Isaiah XI, 2] . From this knowledge come the faculties of courage and bravery, which God grants to whomsoever He will, as it is said: \"Then the Spirit of the Eternal came upon Jephthah\" [Judges XI, 29] and: \"But the Spirit of the Eternal came upon Gideon\" [Judges VI, 34] . For this reason, the author of our book has given \"life of the worlds\" as the first name. As for the sense of the words: \"whose throne is for tified from the beginning,\" this means that the sec ond, tenuous air is for God - may He be celebrated and exalted! - ju st as the throne, by comparison, is for the king. T hus it is said: \"The Eternal hath prepared His throne in the heaven s; and His kingdom ruleth over all,\" [Psalms CIII, 19] . This is the reason why the Tabernacle has been called His t hrone, according to the verse: \"they shall call Jer usalem the throne of the Eternal\" [Jeremiah III, 17] . As for the meaning of the words: \"blessed and whose name is blessed\" this is a general appellation for the light which enters the visible air of the entire world be low, as it is said: \"And blessed be His glorious na me for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory\" [Psalms LXXII, 19] . This object is also what the Wise have called \"Ruach Ha-Qodesh\" [\"Holy Spirit\"] . Actually, after the prophecy had disappeared, a l ight appeared to them as if it were reflected by a mirror, and they heard a voice like an echo, that is to say that the desert reverb erated it to them, and this has been called \"Bath Qol\" [\"daughter of the voice\"] , which means child by the voice. With regard to th is, Scripture has said: \"And thine ears shall hear a wo rd behind thee, saying. . . . \" [Isaiah XXX, 21] . Scripture has not said: [\"before thee\"] . The author of our book says that this concept was t he first created thing, and it is the most tenuous thing in existence, but also the strongest. This is followed by the visible air where the Creator has formed th e ten numbers and the twenty-two letters. 8. On the Geometry of Phonetics and the Order of the Alphabet: The twenty-two letters are three principals, seven doubles, and twelve simples, which are cleaved in t he air, traced by the voice and situated in five places in the mou th. They have divided themselves into five sections : (1) Alef, He, Het, Ayin are pronounced at the extremity of the to ngue with the uvula; (2) Bet, Vav, Mem , Peh are pr onounced with the lips touching and with the tip of the tong ue; (3) Gimel, Yod, Kaf, Qof are articulated with t he side of the tongue; (4) Dalet, Tet, Lamed, Nun, Tav with the mi ddle of the tongue; (5) Zayin, Shin, Samekh, Resh, and Tsadeh are pronounced between the teeth with a quiet tongu e [Chapter Four, ¶3] . According to the different locations in the mouth n ecessary to articulate them, there is also a differ ence between the letters as they are traced into the air. Thus the a uthor has said \"cleaved in the air,\" \"traced by the voice\". The voice traces the letters, dispatches them through the air , cleaves and orders them. The group Alef, He, Het and Ayin [ahacha] is the more delicate and produces a straight line in the air. This is followed by Gimel, Yod, Kaf and Qof [gikhaq] , which produce either unequal or equilateral trian gular figures in the air according to their motion. This group is followed by Dalet, Tet, Lamed, Nun, Tav [datlanat] which produce square figures, either simple or complex according to their movement. Then follows Z ayin, Shin, Samech, Resh, and Tsadeh [zshosrots] which produce oblique figures, some right angled, others acute or obtuse according to their movement in the air. Finally the letters Bet, Vav , Mem and Peh [bumaph] produce spherical forms in the air according to th e force of their pronunciation, some being simple and others more co mplex. The author has enumerated the group [bumaph] after [ahacha] because Bet is the second letter of the alphabet. He who first established the alphabetical sequence, situated Bet towards the beginning to separate thes e five different letter groups, and to prevent thei r combination, as well as to eliminate any difficulties for students and children in pronouncing the letters. Actually, the composition of words with these twenty-two letters usually combine s only the letters corresponding to the different v ocal organs. Two letters which belong to the same letter groupin g are very rarely combined with one another. Thus Z ayin and Shin never appear next to each other in the Hebraic tongue; nor do Samech and Shin; nor Kaf and Gimel; nor are Dalet and Tet coupled in the same word. I have alre ady explained this in the first of the grammatical books. ... 9. On the 231 Gates of Letter Permutation: When He traced, cut, multiplied, weighed and invert ed the twenty-two letters, He created everything wh ich has been created, and everything which will be created in th e future. How did He multiply them? Aleph [¦] with each of the letters and each with Alef, Bet with each one and e ach one with Bet, and the same for Gimel. He turned and inverted them all, and formed the totality of 231 words. All the creatures and all the words cannot exist witho ut another being above them. [Chapter Four, ¶4] . I have translated the words \"hozerot halilah\" as \"t hey turn in a circle and invert themselves\" because every hollow thing is so called in the Hebrew language. The word s \"n'vuv luhot\" [\"hollow with boards,\" Exodus XXVII, 8] are"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"written as \"halil luhin\" in the Targum. Concerning the orifices of the body, it is said that: \"God has created in it many holes and cavities\" [Berakhot 60 b] . In paraphrase, the Targum has likewise said of th e king of Tyre: \"But you have not considered your body which has been made w ith cavities and holes which are indispensible\" [paraphrase of Ezekiel XXVIII, 13] . Similarly, the totality of air in the world is ca lled \"hollow of the world\" because it always revolves [circulates] . This passage is sometimes misunderstood to say: \"Th ey are found to exit through two hundred twenty-one gates,\" and this is incorrect. Though we have learned that calculation demands that this number total two hund red thirty- one, the only number that I have seen written is \"t wo hundred twenty-one.\" I have no doubt that this i s an error. A similar mistake can be found in the Four Gates: \"ev ery Tishri of an embolismic year which begins befor e 695 parts of the twelfth hour.\" Now, in all the texts I have found \"the 11th hour\" written instead of the twelft h, but this is an error. If you add the surplus of two years, one of which is an embolismic year, the new moon will be a t exactly five o'clock on the Sabbath, but it must be at exactly s ix o'clock. It will not be at six, however, unless the twelfth hour is set as the starting point. Analogously, in response to our author's question, \"How did he multiply the m,\" it is correct to give the number two hundred thirty-one as the an swer. I will explain this in accordance with the pr inciple which the author himself applies: \"Alef with all the lett ers and all with Alef, Bet with all and all with Be t,\" etc. This kind of multiplication can be found in the cities of Palest ine and Egypt. The children write this in order to learn how to spell, and these are the twenty-two series which are calle d rows [files] . The first row is Alef-Alef, Alef-Bet, Alef-Gimel, Alef-Dalet, Alef-He, Alef-Vav, Alef-Zayin, up to Al ef-Tav. The second row is Bet-Alef, Bet-Bet, Bet-Gi mel, Bet- Dalet, Bet-He, Bet-Vav, Bet-Zayin up to Bet-Tav. Th e third row is Gimel-Alef, Gimel-Bet, Gimel-Gimel, Gimel- Dalet, Gimel-He, Gimel-Vav, Gimel-Zayin up to Gimel -Tav. It is the same for Dalet-Alef, He-Alef, up to Tav-Alef, Tav-Bet, Tav-Gimel etc., up to Tav-Tav. In all, thi s amounts to twenty-two multiplied by twenty-two or four hundred eighty-four. Of this total, twenty-two word s must be subtracted which are not products [of one letter with another] , namely Alef-Alef of the first row, Bet-Bet of the second row, Gimel-Gimel of the third row, Dalet-Da let of the fourth row, and so on up to Tav-Tav of the t wenty-second row. The reason for this subtraction i s as follows: if Dalet is combined with Dalet, for example, it simpl y produces the same figure in the air and a single word in the verse, and they remain in their original state when they are inverted. Once we have subtracted these t wenty-two [duplicates] , we are left with four hundred sixty-two. Of these four hundred sixty-two, however, only a half are actually different sets of pairs. The pair Alef-Bet in the first row is like the pair Bet-Alef in the second row; Alef- Gimel in the first row is like Gimel-Alef in the th ird; Alef-Dalet in the first is like Dalet-Alef in the fourth, and so on for each of the series. One therefore discovers tha t one half of the letters simply reproduces the oth er half, and thus it is said: \"And they all turn in a circle\" because th ey turn into their reverse. When one subtracts half of the four hundred sixty-two, the remainder is two hundred thi rty-one. Thus we have said: \"The letters are found to exit through two hundred thirty-one gates\". A person can make visible sense of this simply by calculating w ith coins or by writing rows of letters and counting them. I have heard that a commentator on our book has kep t the mistake of two hundred twenty-one gates. He h as attempted to justify this error by saying that the total of Alef-Alef, Alef-Bet, Alef-Gimel, Alef-Dale t and so on is only twenty-one since Alef-Alef is not multiplied [combined] and Alef revolves only around itself. This commentator then multiplies these twenty-one by ten , i.e., the ten numbers, and this amounts to two hu ndred ten. Then he adds the ten numbers and Alef, which is the first unity, and this amounts to two hundred twent y-one. But - may God have mercy upon thee - this is a concatenat ion of a tissue of errors, all due to the fact that the commentator does not know how to multiply. We can cite five rea sons why his explanation is in error: (1) he has mu ltiplied Alef with all the letters but not all the letters with A lef. Later on he repeats this mistake by failing to multiply Bet with all or all with Bet, and the same with the other letter s. He has only multiplied Alef with all; (2) he has multiplied the sum of Alef with all (i.e., twenty-one) by ten, but there is no reason to multiply by ten. The author of our book has not given this direction. He has only directed the inquirer to multiply the letters, and he says \"Alef with all\" and \"Bet with all\". He has not mentioned the ten numbers in this section. The commentator has thus neglected th is direction and has done what was not directed at all; (3) he h as separately added the ten numbers to his product, but this is the chapter on multiplication and not abstraction. Were this the chapter on abstraction, one would add the twenty-two isolated letters, and this would then amount to two hundred forty-three; (4) the commentator has omitt ed the double Alef without multiplying it by ten, and therefore m ust add the isolated Alef, but there is no reason f or this procedure; (5) this commentator's book also contains the phras e: \"and they all turn in a circle.\" Now if the lett ers are multiplied one by another, they do turn in a circle, but they do not turn in a circle if they are merely multipli ed by ten. With that said, I should like to know what remains of this co mmentator's argument to be defended. Our author's purpose in this chapter on multiplicat ion is to demonstrate that the Creator - may He be exalted! - by composing these twenty-two letters through the five procedures of tracing, carving, multiplying, weigh ing and transposing has created all that has been and will create all that will exist in the future. Actually, when He traced"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"straight lines through the circumferences, triangle s in the squares, and drew oblique lines in these c ircumferences, triangles and squares, the results were surfaces an d volumes folding in upon one another according to these marvelous methods which create all forms. This is b y the penetration of the Bet in the Gimel, the Dale t in the He, etc. For this reason, the pairs Alef-Alef, Bet-Bet, Gimel-Gimel, Dalet-Dalet up to Tav-Tav do not enter into such multiplication. If you say Alef one hundred times, it only results in a single form in the air, namely a straight line. And if you speak Bet a hundred times, you will only trace a single circular form repeatedly. This expl ains the creation of the letter forms in the air. However, w e can only establish this form in our spirit. We wi ll not be able to realize this form because it belongs to the Master of the worlds - may He be praised and exalted! The wise, therefore, first teach their students mathematics a nd geometry, for these are the origin of knowledge. 10. On the Crowning of the Letters: The reference to each letter, \"and He attached a cr own to it\" conforms to an ancient principle - of ha ppy memory! One tradition of the letters is that they have been revealed with ornaments and crowns, as it is said: \"Seven letters necessitate three adornments: Shin, Ayin, Tet, Nun, Zayin, Gimel and Tsadeh\" [Menahot 29 b] . It is the same for each letter. For some letters, these adornments aug ment and for others they restrain the deductions dr awn from them, as The Book of Crowns has explained. The ancients a lso had the tradition that when the crowns are not carefully written in the Torah, it is forbidden to pronounce benedictions upon it, and it is not permitted to re ad it in public. For this reason, they say that one who hastily rushes t hrough it will not live long. The ancient amulet ma kers say that the letters are worthless if they have not been written with their crowns. Similarly, our author says that it is not possible to form the triangular, square, folded, chain-forme d, or convex figures (which the letters were meant to form) without a crown. He says, therefore, that \"He attac hed a crown to it\". "}]
