Below is a com parison of four different translations of the Sefer Yetzirah , or Book of Creation . Briefly, the Sefer Yetzirah is probably the oldest mystical and thaumaturgical text in the Hebrew language if not in the world. My purpose here is not to go into depth about its origins, history or even its contents. There is already enough confusion available by following this link: http://www.google.com/search?q=Sefer+Yetzirah ; I have no intention of add ing to it. I have collected four different translations from various web sites. My initial interest was to clarify the attribution of astrological planets and houses to certain letters of the Hebrew alphabet, more properly, alephbet. Originally attempting to master the attribution as a way of improving my score at Thelemic Crazy Eights , a variation on the children's game using the Thoth Tarot deck, I began looking for definitive sources. Starting with Q.B.L. or The Bride's Reception: Being A Qabalistic Tre atise on the Nature and Use of the Tree of Life , by Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater Achad), working through various books by Aleister Crowley and Israel Regardie, I learned that the original source was the Sefer Yetzirah . Being a bit obsessive and pedantic , I decided to find out exactly what it said. Hence this comparison. I should tell you now you won't find the answer here. It turns out there is some disagreement between the various versions of the book. There is actually no definitive Hebrew text, at le ast three major and several variant versions exist. Some of the available translations are less than reliable, especially with regard to the attributions I was seeking. One in particular, that of William Wynn Westcott, was intentionally altered. In his not es on the portion of the text that ascribe planetary symbols to he wrote "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In associating the particular letters to each planet the learned Jesuit Athanasius Kircher allots Beth to the Sun, Gimel to Venus, Daleth to Mercury, Kaph to Luna, Peh to Saturn, R esh to Jupiter, and Tau to Mars. Kalisch in the supplementary paragraphs gives a different attribution; both are wrong, according to clairvoyant investigation. Westcott was one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and helped to propaga te a particular interpretation of Tarot based on the Hebrew alephbet still widely used today. The Golden Dawn system is also the source of for Tarot variations derived by others. Anyone takes Tarot seriously should consider the value he or she places on We stcott's \"clairvoyant investigation.\" A comparison of the various planetary attributions can be found at http://www.psyche.com/psyche/yetsira/sy_planetaryattribution s.html . The four translations I've used here are attributed to Westcott, Isidor Kalisch , Aryeh Kaplan and Gershom Scholem . Westcott and Kalisch are from the Internet Sacred Text Archive , http://www.sac red - texts.com . They are in the public domain. Neither of the sites that host the translations attributed to Kaplan and Scholem claim copyrights or explicitly reference a printed source. As a result of my comparison I suspect the both are from Kaplan's Sef er Yetzirah: The Book of Creation In Theory and Practice , though each appears to differ from it somewhat and one seems to be at least a partial paraphrase. I consider my publication of them here to be fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 . I will respond accordin gly to valid claims of copyright infringement. Use the comment form below to contact me. I claim no special expertise in either textual criticism or the Hebrew language. This comparison was done as an exercise for my own edification. If you find it intere sting or helpful, I am gratified. Each of the translations is laid out in one of four columns in the following table. I have made an effort at harmonizing them as well as I could without changing the order of any of them. Moving across the table allows a comparison of each version with respect to a given portion of the text. Where they disagree I have separated them. For example, in rows I through IV, the language praising the Creator appears after the act of creation in Westcott, Kaplan and Scholem; in Ka lisch it is before. As a result I have separated the language either above or below the actual \"engraving\" of the Universe. The most extensive separations are in chapter 1, rows I through XII; chapter 4, rows XLII through LIII; chapter 5, rows LXVI through LXXVII; and most all of chapter 6. Other portions are less affected mainly because it became tiresome. Initially I simply had four columns generally aligned on either the somewhat inconsistent versification or obvious transitions in thought. By the time I had begun chapter 6, I was recognizing differences in style and emphasis that seemed to require considerable sifting. Completing that, I began to rework the beginning, getting as far as row XII before shrugging my shoulders and asking myself if it were wo rth it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I am uncertain of the which of the various Hebrew texts were used in these translations. It appears Kalisch used what is known as the Long Version , suspected of having had earlier commentary incorporated into the main text by later scribes. Rows V I, XXII, XXXI and XC, for instance, contain material either not found in or considerably expanded beyond the others. Westcott has a tendency to offer interpretation where the others appear to offer a simple rendering of the words. See rows VIII, XVI, XVII, and XXX. The two translations attributed to Kaplan and Scholem are very similar, leading me to think they are both from the same translation, probably Kaplan's, but the one actually attributed to him appears truncated. In the context of the site hosting i t I suspect it was intended more for homiletics than as a complete presentation, and portions considered irrelevant were skipped. The day I wrote this the copy of Kaplan's book I had recently ordered was delivered. I will soon know if my speculations are c orrect. All in all I am glad I set out to do this, even if I didn't really complete it. In the course of my research I learned a great deal about this paradoxically simple and obscure text. I now know its structure and content far better than a I did befo re I started, even if I my comprehension of it is still lagging. I established e - mail contacts with some interesting folks, one especially who has done a musical translation! http://rhythmajik.com /sapphire.html . I found some good web sites dealing with both analysis and application of its content. Those wishing to do more than chase chimera around Google might want to take a look at the links below the table. I make no claims about them except the y are interesting.
