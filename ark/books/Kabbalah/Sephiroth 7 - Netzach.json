It is the opposite to Mars and Ares, being separated on the Tree by Tiphareth , the Sun. Now here is the interesting thing with this triad of Mars, Sun and Venus. Geburah was a female energy, even though it is placed as Mars on the Tree. Now Netzach will be a Male energy according to the Tree's polarities. This might seem odd at firs t, but remember we are talking energies here not the common Wes tern concepts for these planets and Icons. Look at it this way The energy of Mars is Female for it attracts Male characteristics. Conversely the energy of Venus is Male for it looks to attract Female characteristics. Woman seek out Men using the sexy Mars energy and Men use the romantic Venus energy to attract a female . The Sun sits between both and holds them apart. Netzach has the Sephiroth of Chesed at its top and to the left Hod . The balance here is of Judgment and understanding. The romantic energy of Netzach can be moved to Chesed through the Path of Justice and also to Hod via the Path of The Star. Although the usual route is from Hod to Netzach and the path of The Star is a very powerful and seductive way to get there. The Path of Justice is just that, the cold heart of Venus to a platonic Love in Chesed or via The Star to Hod a dreamy Love that is blind to the facts. Geburah 's paths of love also extend around the Sun. To Hod it is via Death and to forget Geburah 's passion and seek only Hod s facts will lead to the Death of love. To Chesed from Geburah is via The Hermit and again to allow the vitality of Mars to be organised and the passion to be controlled will lead to a love that is Herm ited, i.e. alone. The only safe routes s eem to be via the Sun Tiphareth . Of course this is the best way to love through ones heart, the cen tre, the Sun. The path from Geburah to Netzach is via Hanged Man and Temperance. That is to allow events to take their shape and be hanged by circumstance and then afte r the healing energy of Tiphareth to use Temperance to love with limits and not the wild passion that was Geburah . In reverse from Netzach to Geburah it is to use the romance but temper it and not let it be the focus, then heal in Tiphareth and go to Geburah via The Hanged Man and accept your fate and be in it. This way the fire of Mars doesn't burn the air of Venus and visa versa.
