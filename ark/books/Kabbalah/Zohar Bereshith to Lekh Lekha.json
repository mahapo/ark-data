[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Zohar: Bereshith to Lekh Lekha by Nurho de Manhar [1900-14] This is the only extensive translation of a portion of the Zohar, the longest and one of the most impo rtant texts of the Kabbalah, in the public domain. The Zohar is a Kabbalistic commentary on the Hebrew Bible. Long before the 'Bible Code,' Jewish schola rs were attempting to wring deep meaning out of every sylla ble of the text of the Hebrew Bible, using numerolo gy, gematria, and other techniques. Dozens of pages in this book are devoted to analyses of the hidden mea ning behind first few letters of Genesis! This might seem ultra -pedantic; however, the Zohar makes the Biblical te xt come to life, brimming with mystical significance. Seemingly unim portant details and turns of phrase, which you may have read long ago and forgotten, lead to immense vistas of a mysterious world inside the world. This is not a critical edition; written by a pseudo nymous Theosophist, probably British, it is laced w ith out-of-place terminology such as 'Karma' and 'Planes.' It nevert heless lets you wade in the rip current of one of t he most magical of the world's sacred texts, and leaves you gasping for air and wanting more.

This was the only reasonably available edition of this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"translation, which is the longest extant continuous excerpt from the Sepher ha-Zohar published prior t o 1923 (and hence currently in the public domain in the United States). The Zohar is a culturally and historically significant religious text, so preparing an etext of it is cruc ial for my goal of assembling a comprehensive publi c domain collection of electronic texts of English translati ons of sacred texts. The next English translation o f the Zohar was the 1930 London Soncino edition, a substantially co mplete multi-volume translation, which will not ent er the public domain in the United States until 2025 (by US Copyr ight law in 2005). NdM translated the first 200 or so pages from the Z ohar, up to the end of Section Lekh Lekha. This con stitutes a commentary on the Bible from the beginning of Genes is up to Gen. 12:24. The methodology of etext redaction at sacred-texts is to prepare an electronic transcript of a specifi c printed edition selected for a lack of copyright restrictions. This transcript could be used to reconstruct the book i f necessary, including page breaks, footnotes and typography. An y portions changed by the redactor are clearly indi cated; such changes are kept to the absolute minimum, but are a llowed to enhance the usability and readability of the text. No attempt is made to correct factual inaccuracies or update language, modify or internally comment on th e views of the author, or expunge text which offends contemporary sensibilities. The original spelling is retained ex cept where obvious errors such as transposed, obliterated, or omitted letters, or duplicated words occur in the c opy text. Minor punctuation errors are either left uncorrected or s ilently fixed. This methodology was problematic to implement in th is case for several reasons, but I believe that a g ood compromise has been reached. Not a small part of th e difficulty is that the Zohar itself is an extraor dinarily 'difficult,' multi-layered text. The running page numbers in the text refer to the p age numbers in the 1980 edition. I have omitted all Theosophical references and marginalia added by JD, his introduc tory material ('Exordium'), and his two appendices. I have included the 1980 marginal Bible citations and Zoha r page numbers, and paraphrases of incidental notes of differences between NdM and the Soncino edition. Th e marginal Bible citations (but not the ones in the body text) were verified against the electronic King James Ver sion (KJV) of the Bible at sacred-texts (http://www .sacred- texts.com/bib/index.htm), and corrected silently if they varied; in one case the 1917 Jewish Publicati on Society (JPS) translation of the Bible is also referenced. In some cases the marginal Bible citations correct the ones in the text, but these are not noted explicitly. All Bible citations added at sacred-texts are in Arabic nume rals in chapter:verse format, separated by a colon. In thre e cases, I paraphrased JD's explanatory marginal ma terial and included it in a footnote (with my initials i.e.,-- JBH). The marginal Zohar page citations have not been ver ified against a printed edition other than JD's. Th ese are in the conventional format of an Arabic number followed by 'a' or 'b', e.g. 32b. NdM's original text had numerous errata and punctua tion problems, and the Bible citations are a wide v ariety of formats (and often simply incorrect). Errata were c orrected in the conventional fashion for texts whic h I prepare for sacred-texts, i.e., any text in green or linked to the errata file (errata.htm in this directory) was added at sacred-texts by the preparer. Occasionally, minor punctuation er rors or defects were corrected silently. The Bible citations in NdM's text were not reformatted or corrected in any way, unless there was a correction in JD's margina lia, or an actual errata (such as a malformed Roman numeral or misspelled abbreviation). I added running chapter numbers in Roman numerals s olely as placeholders (since many of the section br eaks had no explicit titles); these were inserted at logical breaks in the NdM text (which are also file breaks in this etext). These numbers were not in the original Zohar, NdM o r JD's editions, and should not be used for citatio n purposes. Most problematic are instances where NdM used Theos ophical terminology in his translation, e.g., 'Karm a,' 'Secret Doctrine,' 'Planes of Existence,' etc. These have n ot been altered or flagged in any way, but experien ced students of the Kabbalah can identify these easily. In my opini on, however, these terms do not always map neatly i nto the philosophy and metaphysics of the Kabbalah and migh t be misleading to the novice reader. For this and other reasons, I cannot recommended this as an introducto ry text about the Kabbalah! It is my belief that this level of redaction does n ot embody enough 'creativity' (in the US legal defi nition of the word) to void the public domain status of the text or justify a new copyright claim. I take sole respo nsibility for these alterations and emendations. Moreover, I expl icitly donate my redactions to the public domain.-- JBH. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE SEPHER HA-ZOHAR. OR THE BOOK OF LIGHT. BY NURHO DE MANHAR. AS a preliminary to the translation of the great Ka bbalistic work, \"The Sepher Zohar, or Book of Light ,\" we purpose to sketch in brief outline the history of its origi n, the nature and purpose of its doctrines and teac hings, as also the great influence of its philosophy which is reflecte d in the writings of Albert the Great, Reuchlin, Ra ymond Lully, Boehmen, More the Platonist, Spinoza, Balzac, and m any others whose names are famous in the annals of literature and learning. To the readers of the late Madame Bla vatsky's works, \"Isis Unveiled\" and \"The Secret Doc trine,\" this will doubtless prove acceptable and enable them to understand and comprehend those parts in which she has incorporated the philosophy respecting the Sephirot h and shown its close similarity in many of its asp ects with Eastern teachings. There is scarcely a page in whic h some reference to it is not found, with Hebrew wo rds, the explanation of which would have enhanced the value of the above works and added to the enjoyment and e dification of theosophical students in general. To supply this desideratum it will be necessary to give details r especting Kabbalah of which the Zohar is justly considered to be the prolific fountain from which has flowed tha t stream of occult philosophy that has entered so largely as an element in the teachings of mystics of ancient and modern times. The ancient Jews were not different from other nati ons in having occult schools and institutions in wh ich secret doctrines were inculcated and imparted to neophytes , or the sons of the prophets, as they are termed i n the Bible. These teachings were twofold in their nature and ch aracter, and denominated Beresith , or the science of the natural world; also Mercaba , which had relation to heavenly or spiritual scien ce, and which p. 2 was esteemed and regarded as most sacred and never to be revealed except to initiates, and then only o rally, as amongst the ancient Druids. That which was received was termed \"Kabbalah,\" a Hebrew word, signifying r eception, or, rather, what is received and handed on to other s in short aphorisms and mnemonical words, the mean ing of which could only be deciphered and comprehended by those who had successfully passed through a long co urse of esoteric studies. For instance, A D M, or Adam, tau ght that the soul of Adam the first was incarnated in David the King and will eventually appear in the form of the Messiah. It is said that Kabbalah first originated after the expulsion of Adam from the Garden of Eden, and was communicated to him by the angel Raziel in order th at he might be better able, through attending to its teac hings, to regain his lost estate. The common tradit ion and most generally accepted is that Moses himself was the re al author of Kabbalah, having received it during hi s residence of forty days and nights on Mount Sinai. After his des cent therefrom he imparted it to Aaron, who in turn handed it on to his sons, through whom it was given to the seven ty elders of the children of Israel and coadjutors of Moses in juridical government and polity. Through the judges , especially the prophet Samuel, it was delivered t o David and Solomon, the latter becoming renowned throughout th e East for his extensive and profound knowledge of Kabbalah, by which he was able to perform marvelous things an d acquire control over all beings, demons, spirits of the air, fire and water, and make them his obedient and subservie nt ministers. During the reigns of the various kings of Israel an d Judah we gather that this Kabbalah was widely tau ght and studied in the schools or colleges of the prophets, presided over by hierophants, of whom Elijah and E lisha were remarkable examples, and distinguished not only by their loftiness of character, but also for their kn owledge and manipulation of nature's occult forces and powers, by which they stand out boldly and prominently in J ewish history. These occult societies were generally dist inguished by the wearing of some special badge or e mblem indicative of the peculiar occultism of which they were the professed followers and adherents, such as a raven or hawk, eagle or dove, a lion, a wolf, an ox or a Iam b. Their members, whenever sent out on any benevole nt expedition or political mission, always went in cou ples, similar to the rule of custom in vogue p. 3 at the present time with monks and nuns in the Roma n Catholic community. From this fact we obtain a sa tisfactory and rational explanation of the extraordinary and m iraculous feeding of Elijah by two ravens, who brou ght him in his place of retirement and concealment bread and m eat for his daily sustenance. Instead of two birds noted for their thievish propensities, we see how two members of an occult school, who were perfectly acquainted with the whereabouts of Elijah, and so ministered to the bod ily wants and necessities of their great hierophant . It is also related of Alexander the Great, on his entering int o one of the chief cities of Egypt, that he was wel comed by twelve"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"doves at the head of a large procession of the citi zens, and who greeted his presence with some remark able signs of congratulation, the strangeness of which vanishes a nd disappears when we recognize in these doves memb ers of some occult institution held in veneration by the g eneral populace, and thus qualified to be the expon ents of their good wishes and feelings toward the conquering Alex ander. The Babylonian captivity brought the Jews in to immediate contact with Chaldean and Persian philoso phy, which introduced a great change in their specu lative ideas of the creation and divine government of the world, Chaldean magic and occult science became objects o f deep interest and study, and ultimately resulted in the formation of new societies and sodalities, in which secret rites and ceremonies were performed and celebrated. All knowl edge of their teachings was jealously guarded, and their members were bound by the most solemn oaths not to divulge or reveal them to the profane or common peo ple. These esoteric schools abounded throughout the East , especially in parts of Arabia and adjacent countr ies. And now we enter into the historic domain and gathe r from the pages of Philo Judaeus, a famed Jewish m ystic and philosopher, who in his treatise on the advantages accruing from a contemplative life makes mention an d reference to the Essenes and gives a somewhat full account of their methods and objects of study. They lived an ascetic life, and at stated intervals indulged in meditation afte r reading portions of sacred hooks or writings entr usted to them. At other times they assembled in solemn conclave for i nterchange of thoughts and ideas which had come to them in the seclusion and silence of their cells. \"They spoke s lowly and with deliberation,\" says Philo, \"regardin g eloquence not so much as clearness in expression of p. 4 ideas. They frequently repeated themselves in order that their sayings might become engraved on the mi nds of their auditors. In the interpretation of Scripture they i ndulged greatly in the use of allegories, as the la w appeared to them like a living being. The physical body was the lett ers and words; the soul was the invisible spirit hi dden within them, a spirit by which the student, guided and led by re ason, begins searching after those things which are of importance to him; discovering most wondrous and beautiful tho ughts under the form that envelops them; rejecting mere outward symbols in order to lead the mind to the li ght and for the use and advantage of those who, wit h a little aid, are able to perceive truths and things invisible by means of and through things visible.\" They fully r ecognized that the spiritual world was no remote region in the uni verse, but was surrounding them and not very far aw ay from them. For them there existed no broad deep gulf, no solid wall or partition between the natural and sp iritual worlds, no insuperable and impenetrable barrier between the m and the spirits of great and good men made perfec t and who had once been teachers to nations. If differences t here was between them, it was one of state and cond ition, and this they endeavored to mitigate and obviate by purity o f life and thought, esteeming no self-denial too gr eat, no sacrifice too transcendant or comparable to the enjoyment of spirit intercourse and instruction, resulting in th e subjugation of their lower nature, and so clarifying their minds t hat they became luminous mirrors in which were refl ected the secrets of the universe. This was their philosophy as expressed by an old Arabian sago. \"When my soul, \" said he, \"shall become in harmony with the divine life, then will it be a reflection of nature's great and secr et. truths.\" Such is the general description of these occult sch ools or lodges widely prevalent in the East, and wh ich continued to exist to the time of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, th e great Kabbalist and reputed author of \"The Zohar, or The Book of Light,\" whose name is held in reverence and este em by all true students of occult philosophy. His b iography, though short, is not uninteresting in its character and details. He lived and taught in the reign of H adrian, the Roman Emperor, when the Jewish nation was subject to much hardship and persecution and their Rabbis or recog nized teachers labored under grievous disabilities, being prohibited from giving instructions to their stude nts, a restriction which Rabbi Simeon had the singular p. 5 boldness and courage to ignore and disregard, and t hus incurred the anger and displeasure of the Roman rulers. He had to flee for his life and conceal himself in an unknown and solitary abode. He had been holding a d iscussion in one of the synagogues with Jehuda ben Illai and Jos e ben Halefta, two famous Rabbis, on the comparativ e character of Jewish and Roman manners. Jehuda commenced his d iscourse with an eloquent eulogium on the Romans as the greatest promoters of the material convenience and civilization of the people they governed, instancin g their public works, architecture, and the patronage they gave to the useful arts. When Rabbi Jose's turn came to sp eak he exhibited the cautiousness which had given him the surname of \"The Prudent,\" and observed an impressiv e silence. The discretion of his colleagues was, however, lost upon Simeon, whose animosity to the Romans for the harshness and cruelty exhibited toward his brethren vented it self in a fiery invective against the oppressors, w hich, becoming the topic of public conversation, aroused and excit ed the displeasure of the civil authorities. He, al ong with the above Rabbis, was summoned to appear before the mag istrates. The silence of Rabbi Jose was deemed a su fficient ground for banishment to Sepphoris; Rabbi Jehuda wa s allowed to exercise the office of a preacher in t he synagogue; but Rabbi Simeon was condemned to death, a sentence which he evaded and escaped by immediat e and timely flight, accompanied by his son Eliezar. For several years he remained in seclusion and lived as a hermit in a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"cavern, engaged in the development of Kabbalistic s cience as embodied in the Book of Zohar. After the death of the Emperor Antoninus he left his place of concealment and reappeared as the founder of a school in Tekoa, a town in Palestine. About three hundred of his sayings are r ecorded in the Talmud. The whole of his life was ab sorbed and spent in the study of Kabbalah, in which science he was and still is regarded as one of its most emine nt masters. He lived in a world of his own, in a region beyond the bounds of ordinary nature. Students and learned Ra bbis from all parts flocked to him and enrolled themselves as mem bers of his school, in which subjects of the highes t philosophy were discussed. Instructions by great teachers, suc h as Moses, who in the Zohar is styled The Faithful Shepherd, and the great prophet Elijah, who in luminous and respl endent forms appeared in their midst, were imparted on matters and subjects of the most abstruse and occult charac ter, and which were recorded p. 6 in secret writing by students deputed and chosen fo r that object. There is an affecting account of his death given by one of his students in the \"Idra Seta, or \"Lesser A ssembly,\" one of the appendices to the Zohar. As a teacher he had lived and as a teacher he died, surrounded by schol ars who loved him dearly. \"Mercy,\" he was saying, \" hath ascended unto the Holy of Holies, for there Adonai hath commanded his blessing forevermore, even life everlasting.\" There was a sudden pause. His head fe ll slowly on his breast. Intently gazing upon him, they listened in deep silence for further words, but no words came f rom those lips that had been so eloquent in speech. They were his last words, and not inappropriate as a finale t o a life like his. Suddenly a strange supernatural light surrounded the house. \"At that moment,\" says Rabbi the Scribe, \"I heard a voice, which said: 'Before thee are cou ntless days of blessedness,' and then another, saying: 'He asked l ife of thee and thou gayest him the years of eterni ty.' Throughout all that day the flame continued around the house, and no man entered or went forth. I lay weeping and sobbing on the ground. At length the fire departed, and I perc eived that the soul of him who was the Light of Isr ael had departed also. His corpse was reclining on the right side, a nd a smile was on his face. Eliezar, his son, took his hands and kissed them. We could find no utterance for our gri ef till tears began to flow. Three times his son fe ll down in speechless sorrow. At length the power of utterance came to him, and he cried, 'Father! Father!' As th e funeral procession moved toward the grave a light revealed itself in the air, and a voice was heard exclaiming : 'Come! Gather yourselves together to the marriage feast of Simeon.'\" Ere entering upon the analysis of the Zohar and its con-tents, we would premise that the Kabbalists te ach that the Divine Being has expressly committed his mysteries to certain chosen individuals, who in their turn ha nded down to others who proved themselves worthy recipients of t hem. These mysteries relating to man's spiritual ex istence and guidance are concealed in parts of the Holy Scriptu res, the interpretation of which is the province of Kabbalah. To understand these mysteries the student will find it necessary to acquaint himself with the metaphysica l principles as laid down in the earliest writings and documents of this science, as in later times professors of Kabb alah have incorporated with it many of their own ideas and ph ilosophic doctrines culled from Greek and Arabian s ources. p. 7 Kabbalah as a constituted science or system of Theo sophy is divided into two separate sections, The Th eological and The practical; this dealing with the visible cr eation and termed Bernhik ; that dealing with the spiritual world and the attributes and perfection of the Divine Being i s denominated the Mercaba , or the chariot throne, with its attendant angels, as seen and described in the open ing chapters of the Book of Ezekiel the Prophet. The doctrines of Creation are succinctly outlined i n the \"Sepher Yitsira, or Book of Creation,\" the im puted author of which is said to be no less a personage than Abraha m the Patriarch himself. As this work, with a trans lation of its contents, will form a subject of future considerati on, we shall confine our remarks to the no less imp ortant Kabbalistic work, The Zohar. In order that our readers may obtain a clearer idea of the philosophy of this strange and remarkably i nteresting book, it will perhaps not be out of place to lay down or touch upon a few of the fundamental axioms which mo re or less form the basis of systems of philosophy, ancient or modern, Eastern or Western, and especially in Kabb alah; such as \"From out of nothing, nothing can proceed; therefor e no substance that now exists has been produced fr om nothing, and whatever exists is in one sense untreated. All existing substances are emanations from one eternal substance.\" In the act of what is commonly termed creation the ete rnal Being drew from himself; consequently there is no such thing as matter in our sense of the word. Whatever we call matter is only another form or species unde r which the spirit comes into manifestation. Therefore the univ erse is a realization of the Infinite, an immanent effect of his ever- active power and presence. Though all existence flo ws front the divine, yet is the world different fro m the Godhead, as the effect is different from the cause. Neverthe less, as not separate, but abiding immanently in hi m, creation is evermore the manifestation of himself. The world is the mantle with which he clothes himself, or, rath er, it is a revelation of the Godhead, not in his hidden essenc e, but in his visible glory. In giving existence to the universe the first act of the almighty was the production of a p ower and principle intimately and specially related to himself, to which are given the names of his holy spirit, his p ersonal world, his first-begotten son and which the Kabbalists in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"general personify and term Adam Kadmon , or the archetypal Man, and who in turn caused to proceed from emanations from himself p. 8 all the lower forms of actual existence in their se veral descending series and gradations. According to Kabbalists, God is the author of the l etters. Spirit is a revelation of thought and the f orm in which intellect or mind pronounces itself most distinctly . Letters are the organic elements of speech, and t herefore he who taught man language or who made him, as one of the Targums expresses it, \" ruach mamelella ,\" a speaking spirit, must have been the author of the letters of the pri meval language. The first ten numbers and the twent y-two letters of the alphabet, considered analogically as types of d ivine operation, are denominated the thirty-two pat hs of wisdom of which the almighty created the universe. \"The wo rks of God,\" says the author of \"Cosri,\" another fa mous Kabbalistic work, \"are the writing of Him whose wri ting is his Word, and whose word is his thought, so that the words, work and thought of God are one, though they seem to man to be three.\" As in the universe harmo ny reigns in manifoldness, so the letters and numbers constit ute a system which has its centre and hierarchy. Th e unit predominates over the three. The three rules over t he seven; the seven over the twelve. The centre of the universe is the celestial dragon. The circuit of the zodiac is the basis of the year. The heart is the centre in m an. The first is elevated in the world like a king upon his throne. In the seven organs of the body there is a kind of opposition which sets the one against the other as in battle array. Three promote love, three engender hatred. Three be stow life, three lead to dissolution, and one cannot be apprehended by the mind without the other. Over the whole of th is triple system, over man, the world and time, over numbers, letters and sephiroth, the only true king, the one God rules forever and ever. Such are the chief fundamental id eas which permeate the whole texture of the Zohar, which, as we have observed, forms the standard and code of Kabba listic philosophy. The body of the books takes the form of a commentary extending over the five books of Moses, viz.: the Book of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbe rs, and Deuteronomy, and is of a highly mystical and allego rical character, and which was the most general and favored method of teaching and imparting instruction in Eas tern countries. In addition to these, there are eig hteen supplementary portions, viz.: 1. Siphra Dzeniutha, The Book of Mysteries . 2. Idra Rabba, The Great Assembly , referring to the school p. 9 or college of Rabbi Simeon's students in their conf erences for Kabbalistic discussion. 3. Idra Seta, The Lesser Assembly , of the few disciples that that remained for the s ame purpose toward the end of their master's life or after his decease. 4. Sabba, The Aged Man . 5.

Midrash Chasith, On the Canticles . 14 Maamar Ta chasi, a discourse, so-called from its first words, \" Come and See .\" 15. Ianuka, \" The Youth .\" 16. Pekuda, Illustrations of the Law . 17. Chibbura Kadma, The Early Work . 18. Mathuitin, Doctrines . The commentary is sometimes called Zohar gadol, the Greater Light; the supplements, Zohar Katon, or th e Lesser Light. Though the Zohar is said to be a commentary on the Pentateuch, it must be understood that the i nterpretation is Kabbalistic, and that the literal sense of the w ords is only a covering or garment of the true mean ing. With the Kabbalists there are two ways of regarding and spea king of the Divine Being. When they speak simply an d directly of his nature and attributes their style is severel y metaphysical and abstruse, but at other times the y indulge in the use of metaphor and allegory to a most extraordinar y, if not extravagant, degree, at the same time dec laiming against the possibility of any attempt to describe the incomprehensible (because infinite) Being. This is especially the c ase with the Siphra Dzeniutha , or Book of Mysteries, of which the following extr act is a fair sample of its style:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\"He is the ancient of ancients, the mystery of myst eries, the concealed of the concealed. He hath a fo rm peculiar to himself, but he hath chosen to appear to us the anc ient of ancients. Yet in the form whereby we know h im he remaineth p. 10 still unknown. His vesture is white and his aspect that of an unveiled face. He sitteth on a throne of splendors, and the white light streameth over a hundred thousand w orlds. This white light will be the inheritance of the righteous in the world to come. Before all time En Soph , the boundless One, the unoriginated and infinite Being, existed without likeness, incomprehensible and unknowable. In the p roduction of finite existence the first act was the evolution of the Memra , or the Word, which was the first point in the des cending series of beings, and from whom in nine oth er degrees of manifestation emanated those forms which at once compose the universe and express the attri butes and presence of its eternal ruler. To these nine forms is given the common name of Sephiroth , signifying Splendors . The whole or some of these Sephiroth constitute the uni verse, the manifestation of God, their names being: 1. Kether, Crown . 2. Chocma, Wisdom . 3. Binah, Understanding . 4. Chesed, Mercy . 5. Din, Justice . 6. Tiphereth, Beauty . 7. Netzach, Triumph . 8. Hod, Glory . 9. Yesod, Foundation . 10. Malkuth, Kingdom or Dominion . The primordial essence is before all things. In his abstract and eternal nature and condition he is in comprehensible, and as an object of the understanding, according to the Zohar, he is nothing, the mystery of mysteries ; but he took form as he called forth them all. The ancient of an cients is now seen in his own light; that light is his holy name, the totality of the Sephiroth. The order of their emana tion is as follows: From Kether, the Crown, the pri mal emanation of En Soph, proceed two other Sephiroth--Chocma (wi sdom), active and masculine; the other Binah (understanding), passive and feminine, the combinat ion of which results in thought, of which the unive rse is the effect. The crowned Memro, or Kether, or primordial Logos, is the thinking power in creation, Chocma t he act of thinking, and Binah the subject of the thinking. Sa ys Cordovero, author of a famous Kabbalistic work, Pardis Rimmonim , or the Garden of Pomegranates: \"The forms of all earthly beings are in these three Sephiroth, as the y themselves are in him who is their p. 11 fountain.\" The seven other Sephiroth develop themse lves also into triads, in which two antithetical me mbers are united by a third. Thus Chesed (mercy) is the antit hesis of Din (justice), and both are united in Tiph ereth (beauty). These terms, however, are not used as in our common theology and ethics in the moral or spiritual sens e, but have rather a cosmological or dynamic meaning, Chesed si gnifying the expansion of the divine Will, and Din its concentrated energy. These two attributes are calle d in the Zohar the arms of God; and Tiphereth, whos e symbol is the breast or heart, is the expression for the good they produce and uphold. The next three Sephiroth- -Netzach, Hod, and Yesod--are also of a dynamical character, repre senting the producing power of all existence. Netza ch, masculine, and Hod, feminine, are used in the sense of expansiveness and grandeur, and denote the powe r from which all the forces of the universe proceed and co mbine themselves in a common principle, Yesod, the foundation or basis of all things. Viewed under one aspect, th ese three Sephiroth or attributes reveal the Deity in the character in which the Bible speaks of him as Jehovah Zebaoth, o r the Lord of Hosts. The tenth and last of the Seph iroth, Malkuth, sets forth the divine sovereignty and its never-ending reign within and by all the others. Th us we see that these Sephiroth are not mere instruments different from the divine substance. He is present in them; b ut is more than what these forms of being make visible. They cannot in themselves express the Infinite. While each of them has a well-defined name, he, as Infinite, can have no nam e. Whilst, therefore, God pervades all worlds which reveal to us his presence, he is at the same time exalted above them. His immutable nature can never be meted or sc anned; therefore the Zohar compares these Sephiroth to cla sses of various colors through which as media the d ivine light shines unchanged as the sun-beam is unchanged, what ever medium transmits it. Again, these ten theogoni c Sephiroth are resolved into three classes, and make what is termed olam atzoloth , the world of emanation. The first three are of a purely intellectual nature, and are exponents of the olam maskel, or \"intelligent world ,\" and set forth the absolute identity of being and thon ht. The sec ond triad is of a cosmological and moral character, expressing the energy of rectitude and grace in the revelation of the beautiful. In them the almighty appears as the summum bonum . The remaining triad represents the divine architect as the foundation"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"p. 12 and producing cause of all visible being, and is te rmed olam hamotava , the physically developed world. Furthermore, these worlds are divided in a fourfold manner, viz.: (1) Atzeloth, emanative world; (2) B ariah, creative world, referring to the higher order of spirits; (3 ) Yetsira, formative world, including all the heave nly bodies; (4) Asosah, or olam hamotava, terrestrial world, which latter, though containing the dregs of existence, i s nevertheless considered as immaterial, for matter in the ordinar y idea or conception of it, on account of its imper fection and inability, would be, as an emanation from God, an i mpossibility and a contradiction. The divine efflux of vivifying glory, so resplendent at its fontal source, becomes less potent as it descends in the scale of being, till, in the phenomenon termed \"matter,\" it exists in its embers , or, as the Kabbalists describe it: \"Like a coal i n which there is no longer any light.\" The Zohar gives a beautiful i llustration of the intimate and unique relation of three worlds from the flame of a lamp, the upper and white light of w hich symbolizes the intellectual ; the lower and more shaded light, which insensibly blends itself with the upper one, represents the world of feeling ; whilst the grosser material, which is beneath all, is the emblem of the physical world . That the above remarks may be better understood, we subjoin the following: p. 13 Taking the three central Sephiroth as the highest m anifestation of their respective trinities, the Zoh ar represents the crown as symbol of the one infinite substance; Tiph ereth, or beauty, as the highest expression of mora l perfection, and Malkuth, the kingdom, the permanent activity of all the Sephiroth together--the presence or shekin ah of the divine in the universe. The ground principle of Zoh ar philosophy is that every form of life, from the lowest element of the organic world up to the purest and brightest beams of the Eternal Wisdom, is an emanative manif estation of God, and consequently that every substance separate from the first great cause is both a chimera and a n impossibility. All substance must be ever with and in him, or it would vanish like a shadow. He is the refore ever- present, not with it only, but in it. In him it has its being, and its Icing is himself. All is one un broken chain of Being, of which the Memra is the second and En Soph the first element. There can therefore be no such thing as annihilation. if evil exists, it can only be an abe rration of the divine Law, and not as a principle. With the Kabbalists bereshith (creation) and beraka (blessing) are interchangeable terms. He believes that in the moral world wicked beings will eventually develop a better state of ch aracter and conduct; that Satan himself at some fut ure time will regain his primitive angel name and nature. Cordove ro asserts that \"hell itself will vanish; suffering , sin, temptation and death will be outlived by humanity and he succe eded by an eternal feast, a Sabbath without end.\" A nother teaching of the Zohar is that the lower world is an image of the one above it. Every phenomenon of nat ure is the expression of a divine idea. The starry firmament i s a heavenly alphabet by which the wise and spiritu ally-minded can read the interpretation of p. 14 the present and the history of the future. So with respect to man; he is the compendium and climax of the works of God, the terrestrial shekinah. He is something more than mere flesh and bone, which are the veil, the vestment, which, when he leaves earth, he throws off and is t hen unclothed. As the firmament is written over wit h planets and stars, which, rightly read, make the hidden known, so on the firmament of the human surface or skin th ere are lines and configurations which are symbols and marks of c haracter and destiny. The inner man is, however, th e true man. In him, as in the Divine self, there is a trinity i n unity, viz.: 1, The Neshama (spirit); 2, Ruach (soul); 3, Nephesh (the sensuous or animal life), intimately related to the body and dissolving when it, the body, dies. The N ephesh never enters the portals of Eden or the celestial Paradis e. Besides these elements in us, there is another r epresenting an idea or type of the person which descends from heaven at the time of conception. It grows as we grow, remai ns ever with us, and accompanies us when we leave the earth. It is known as our ycchidah , or principle of our individuality. The temporal union of the two higher elements, spirit a nd soul, is not regarded, as with the ancient Gnost ics, an evil, but a means of moral education, a wholesome state of tr ial, in which the soul or lower nature works out in the domain of sense, a probation for ultimate felicity. Human lif e, in its perfect character, is the complete agreem ent between the higher and lower selves, or, as the Zohar expresses it, between the king and queen. The soul at presen t is being schooled and disciplined to this harmony. It is lik e a king's son sent away for a time from the palace to fulfil a course of training and education, and then to be recalled home. Another prominent doctrine in the Zohar regar ding man is the union of the masculine and feminine principles in him, and which in combination form one moral bei ng. Before the earthly state the male and female soul, the two halves of our nature, existed then in union. When they came forth upon the earth to work out their probation they wer e at first separated, but eventually will come toge ther and be indissolubly united. If probation of final bliss he not accomplished or successfully achieved in one l ife, another life is entered upon, and then, if necessary, a third. W hen the work of purification and enlightenment is c ompleted and ended the soul attains to the consummate happiness in the fruition of the divine; that is, in the intu itive vision of his glory, in perfect love, and in that oneness with hi mself"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"p. 15 in which it will have the same ideas and the same w ill with him and like him will hold dominion in the universe as St. Paul himself affirms: \"We shall judge the angel s.\" From this brief outline and sketch of the teachings of the Zohar we may sum them up as follows: Regard ing the facts and words of the Scriptures as symbols, it teaches us to confide in our own powers in the task of inte rpreting them. It sets up reason in place of priestly authority. Inst ead of a material world distinguishable from God, b rought out of nothing by his will and subjected to successive cha nges in fulfilling the purposes and plan of the cre ator, it recognizes countless forms under which one divine s ubstance unfolds and manifests itself and all of th em pre- existent in the divine intelligence; that man is th e highest and most perfect of these forms, and the only one through whom God is individually represented; that man is t he bond between God and the world, being the image of each according to his spiritual and elemental nature. Or iginally in the divine substance, man returns to it again when the necessary and preparatory process of the earthly li fe shall be finished and completed; for from the Di vine have we come, and unto the Divine must we return at last. The chief aim and object of all systems of philosop hy has been to give a rational account of man's rel ation to the Divine; a right conception of which is the fundamen tal basis of all social, political, and spiritual g rowth and progress. Ignorant of this, the mind of man can nev er become imbued with clear ideas and conceptions a s to the true object of his existence, of its whence or whither , and is therefore doomed to wander in a state of m ental darkness and incertitude highly prejudicial to the exercise of t hose faculties by which he is able to investigate t he real nature of things and understand the laws governing the univer se in which, as a part, he lives and moves and has his being. In proportion that he has attained to the knowledge of nature, and extracted from her the secrets of his being, so has he succeeded in ridding himself from the errors of the past and marched with slow though steady steps tow ards a higher plane of life and thought, which, having gained, br ighter and grander vistas of higher truths present themselves, inviting him to further research and investigation which, though attended with errors and mistakes, ha ve been corrected by experience--the test of all true knowl edge and the great and universal teacher of mankind . For this reason the history of philosophy may be described p. 16 as the epitome of human errors and mistakes, of err oneous opinions and misconceptions; of cosmological systems based upon inadequate notions and imperfect inducti ons; all of whist had their day and then vanished i nto oblivion, the tomb of creeds, the grave of specious systems a nd dogmas that were unable to subsist and endure be cause they were not the true expositions of human life and des tiny. To trace their origin and investigate their b eginning is not without profit and advantage to those students who, comparing past and present systems of religion and philosophy, are thus able to divine and cull therefrom the trut h that makes us free, that expands the mind and qua lifies us to behold and view things not as they seem to be, but as they are in themselves; so that we catch glimpse s of her majestic form not as in a glass darkly, but face to face. In our preceding remarks on The Zohar, we gave in b rief outline the substance of its teachings on the dogma of man's origin and existence, and his relationship to the Creator and the universe; teachings which in t heir nature and character are so different from the ordinary views both of Jews and Christians, that the question natu rally rises, how was it that such a system of philosophy arose and b ecame propagated amongst a nation whose conceptions of the Deity and Creation are so diametrically and radical ly dissimilar, as light to darkness? How came it ab out that a people so conservative in their religious notions, fostered within itself a feeling amounting almost t o veneration for the teachings of The Zohar, or Kabbalah, as they we re termed, as is evidenced by a long list of Jewish Rabbis, honored and still held in esteem for their great le arning, piety and scholarly attainments'? The answer to these questions compels us to take a comparative view of those systems of eastern philos ophy amidst which Kabbalah sprang up and manifested such a vigo rous growth as to outlast many of its competitors i n the power and influence it has exercised over the minds of th e thoughtful and studious. Ere, however, we do this , we shall have to dismiss , and put aside as erroneous, the common tradition that Kabbalah is of divine origin; first imparted t o Moses on Mount Sinai, and then handed through him t o the seventy elders, which could not be for the re ason just advanced, that its teachings and philosophy are opp osed to and bear scarcely any resemblance to Jewish theology. This being the case, we have to consider to what sy stem of philosophy Kabbalah was related in the time that Rabbi p. 17 [paragraph continues] Simeon Ben Iochai first taught it. We may reduce t hese to four, viz., the Platonic philosophy; that of the Alexandrian School in Egypt; of Zoroast er in Persia; and of the Brahmins in India. Though there is in some respects a striking analogy between Platonism and Kabbalah, yet, after a compa rison of their distinctive leading tenets, we are forced to the conclusion that Kabbalah did not originate from Platonism. In both systems the Logos, or Divine Wisdom, is the pr imordial archetype of the universe and acts a media torial part between the divine idea and the objects that are th e manifestation of it. In both are to be found the dogmas of pre-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"existence, reminiscence, reincarnation and metempsy chosis, so that some Kabbalists have supposed Plato to have been a disciple of Jeremiah the prophet, in order t o account for this rather remarkable and coincident similarity of ideas. There are, however, great differences betwee n the two that make it impossible to assert that th e one is a copy of the other. The Kabbalists believed in one primal substance, Spirit. Plato acknowledged two, spirit and matter, the intelligent cause and the created material produced . Neither can the Kabbalistic Sephiroth be reconcil ed with the ideas and doctrine of Plato or his teaching respect ing those forms or archetypes of things which exist ed in the divine Mind from eternity. Those ideas, according to him, abide in that Mind, are inseparable from it, are th e divine Intelligence itself, and are the prototypes of all existing things; whereas the Sephiroth are divided into two classes and figuratively set forth as masculine and feminin e, proceeding alike from the eternal fountain En So ph, then combining themselves in a common personified power called the Son, from whom they again become disting uished in a new and further form of development. It is imp ossible to compare this doctrine with Plato's triad of the Father , the Son , and the Soul of the World, without perceiving that Kabbalah and Platonism can never be identified and considered as one. We must therefore seek its origi n from some other source than the Platonic philosop hy. Some writers have sought to prove that Kabbalah too k its rise from what is known as the Alexandrian Sc hool of philosophy. the home of Neoplatonism. Here, again, though there are great resemblances and close coinc idences between them, as, God is the immanent ground and su bstantial source of all being--all goes out from hi m and all returns to him again. They both recognize the neces sity of a trinity and also agree in regarding p. 18 the universe as a divine manifestation, also in the ir doctrines concerning the Soul and its final retu rn to God; yet if there has been any copying we are warranted in supp osing that the Neoplatonists copied and took from t he Kabbalists. Kabbalah was developed in Palestine. It s very language, its composition and direct associa tion with rabbinical institutions set this beyond doubt. The Jews of Alexandria held but little intercourse with their brethren in Palestine and never entered into intimate relations with the rabbis either of Palestine or Babylon, wh o were greatly averse to Greek wisdom and learning and forbade tha t children should be instructed therein. Whilst the Palestinian Jews detested and despised Greek philosophy, they t ook kindly and received Kabbalah, which was held in honor and esteem long years before Neoplatonism was ever thou ght of or appeared as a system of philosophy. It ha s also been said that Kabbalah was either directly or remotely the result of the teachings of Philo Judaeus, who r esided at Alexandria at the beginning of the Christian era. T his assumption, after a strict analysis of Philo's works cannot be drawn nor substantiated, inasmuch as they are total ly and altogether opposite in their principles and systems of philosophy. Philo is more Platonic than Kabbalistic in his ideas. For instance, he posits the Platonic dualism; God, and a creation which once had a beginning, an activ e principle, divine Intelligence; and a passive one , matter pre- existent, shaped and conformed to an idea conceived in the divine Mind. \"God,\" he says, \"is not only t he Demiurgos or Architect of the world, but also its Creator, ca lling all into creation by an act of his will, and as he pervades the universe by his presence in order to sustain it, he may therefore be said to be the place of the unive rse, for he contains within himself all things. He himself is t he world, for God is All.\" To explain these asserti ons, he proceeds: \"God is the unapproachable and incomprehensible Lig ht. No creature can behold him--but his image shine s forth in his thought, the Logos, through which we can become acquainted with him.\" But to this first manifestat ion of the divine Being, Philo, like Plato, gives an hypostati c or personal character. He is God's first begotten . This first or elder Logos produces another Logos who exerts a cre ative power of which the world is a manifestation. In the exposition of his ideas of creation, we meet with m any interspersed remarks on the nature of angels wh ich are very different from the ideal principles as represented by the Kabbalistic Sephiroth. In his discourses on man, Philo distinguishes p. 19 between the intellectual and the sensuous soul, whi ch latter he affirms has its seat in the blood. In attempting to ascend to the intuition of divine and spiritual tru th, it may be well, as he teaches, for the mind to occupy itself at first with merely human knowledge, just as the body requi res milk before it can be capable of strong meat. B ut in the direct effort to obtain an insight into higher or h eavenly truth, it is necessary to curb or place the senses in abeyance and let the intellect exercise itself independently of them altogether. When, however, such knowledge is attained, it is not by mere dint of mental labor or by the aid o f philosophy, but by direct illumination from the D ivine. He also believed in the possibility of the mind to attain i ntuitive perceptions of Deity himself, at the same time laying great stress on the exercise of faith, which he calls \"th e queen of all virtues.\" Faith lifts the veil of se nse and conducts the spirit of man to an union with God, which has been exemplified more or less in the lives of all great mystics of ancient and modern times. From the study of early C hristian and Gnostic writings, we arrive at the sam e conclusion, that though there may be found similarities and aff inities between some of their teachings and those o f Kabbalah, they are too slight to warrant the notion that the latter proceeded from Christianity. The dualism of the Christian faith, of a God and a created universe of matter an d spirit as components of the universe, cannot be r econciled with"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the one substance of the pantheistic Kabbalah, In t he Gnostic Bible, Liber Adami, the Book of Adam, or the Codex Nazareus as it is known to students (of which an ac count of its contents and teachings will be given f or the first time in English, in the pages of THE WORD), we meet with scattered remarks on the degeneration of natures a t each degree of remoteness from the Divine fountain of be ing, the production of actual things by the Logos; the four worlds--the male and female soul and their union--a lso the symbolism of numbers and letters of the alp habet, which, though showing some relationship, does not confirm the derivation of Kabbalah from it. Whence then did Kabbalistic philosophy derive its o rigin, For the resolution of this question we must go eastwards to Babylon, whither the Jewish people were transpla nted as captives at the fall of Jerusalem, and wher e the teachings of Zoroaster were exercising a wide influence over the popular mind. What those teachings were we are able to judge from the sacred book of the Persians, the Zen d Avesta, a copy of which was p. 20 first found and brought to Europe in the beginning of the 18th Century by Anquetil Perron, a learned F renchman. In this sacred book may be found all the great primord ial principles of the Kabbalistic system. Thus the En Soph of Kabbalah corresponds to Zeruane Akarene, the \"Etern al Boundless One,\" of the Zend Avesta. Another epit het of the Deity amongst the ancient Persians was \"Boundless S pace\" similar to the Kabbalists Makom or Place. The Logos, or Memra, or THE WORD, is the Honofer or Ormuzd of the Persian, by whom the world was produced and who is a Mediator between the boundless and incomprehensible Zeruane and finite beings. As the medium by which the attributes of the Deity become known, his throne is light, and like Adam Kadmon or \"the heavenly man\" in Kabbalah, he unites in himself true wisdom, the hig hest understanding, greatness, grace, beauty, power , and glory, and is the fashioner and sustainer of all things, o f all beings, a most remarkable coincidence with th e doctrine of the ten Sephiroth. Now Zoroaster flourished at the very time of the Jewish captivity, during which their r abbis first came into contact and under the influence of a religious philosophy which in many particulars was very simi lar to their own cherished teachings. In the Zend Avesta they fo und, as in the Book of Genesis, the tradition of th e six days of creation, an earthly paradise, the demon tempting i n the form of a serpent--the fall of the first pair who, before it, lived the life of angels, but after were obliged to clothe themselves with the skins of animals and de lve in the earth to acquire the means of sustenance for their bodily wa nts. There also was found a prophecy of a future re surrection of the dead and a last judgment, which, in order to ex plain their presence in the Persian scriptures, som e Biblical scholars assume that Zoroaster, their author or com piler, took them from the .Jewish writings and inco rporated them into his own theological doctrines. Be that as it m ay, it must always remain a supposition and a debat able question. There is, however, no gainsaying that the Jews appr opriated some of his ideas which eventually were em bodied in their Talmuds. In the rabbinical schools of Babylon there were esoteric teachings imparted, but only t o a select few, some of whose names have been handed down as famous Kabbalists, such as Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Oshaya . In this way Kabbalah was propagated, and at last found a home in Palestine. Again, we must go more eastward still until we come to India, whence Zoroaster drew the fundamentals o f the system of p. 21 religious philosophy by which he is distinguished a nd regarded as one of the great teachers in ancient times. In that far off land beyond the river Indus, is found a peo ple who at that remote period in the world's histor y had reached its zenith and attained to a high state of civilization never enjoyed by any other preceding nation. In it s magnificent and stupendous monuments of architecture and sculpture which have escaped the ravages of time or of vandal conquerors--in its profound systems of philosophy e laborated by Rishis, who were accounted as divine b eings and renowned and venerated for their wisdom and learnin g--in their compositions of art and poetry, whose b eauty, elegance and sublimity have never been surpassed by the productions of Western mind and thought, and b eyond all these, in its solemn and mysterious religion with i ts esoteric doctrines and teachings, its imposing s ymbolic ritual and ceremonies, the Hindus, even in those ancient t imes, were far in advance (the Egyptians excepted) of all other nations. She was the ark in which were preserved th e sacred remnants and fragments of a previous and n ow unknown civilization, which were systematized by he r great Rishis and handed down for the benefit of h umanity in succeeding ages. To her as to a great shrine of tru th, great souls from out of all lands and countries , as Pythagoras and others, wandered and came for instruction and k nowledge that would explain the great mysteries of life and being, ignorance of which is the great obstacle and barrier to human progress. Though through the all- prevailing law of change and the action of Karma which operates in the life of nations as of individuals, the glory o f India has been eclipsed and her fair and fertile territories have been overrun and ravaged by ruthless and barbarous conquerors whose object was plunder anti rapine, yet lives she on, unconquered, unsubjugated in soul, in which st ill pulsate and throb those ideas and conceptions of beauty, and, w orking like leaven, silently, yet effectually, are both a prophecy and a guarantee of a future renovation of national life which will cause her to become again the parag on of nations and the teacher and instructor of the world.

Her sacred book s, regarded as divine in their origin and revelatio n, are divided into Vedas and Puranas treating of a great variety of subjects, theological, legendary, ethical and de votional. In addition to these are the magnificent epic poems, t he Ramayana and the Mahabharata, in the latter of w hich is found that gem of human thought, that flower of spiritual philosophy, which stands unique in the world's lit erature: the Bhagavad-Gita, the divine song, the song par excell ence. We do not presume to assert that all the deta ils of Kabbalistic philosophy are found in these most anci ent documents. What we would assert after analyzing and comparing them is, that in these Hindu writings are to be found the radical principles of Kabbalah in unmistakable form. In both the systems, Indian and Kabbalistic, there is a recognition of a self-existent and etern al nature, indefinable, inconceivable, to which is given the a ppellation of Brahm, corresponding to Zeruane Akere ne of the Persians, mid En Soph of the Kabbalists. There is a lso it filial emanation of this infinite nature who is as a firstborn son of Brahm and bears the name of Brahma. \"From th at which is,\" says Manu, \"without beginning or end, was produced the Divine Man famed in all worlds,\" a per sonification strangely similar and coincident with the Memra, the Adam Kadmon, the heavenly man, prototype of man kind, of the Kabbalists. Again the universe is prod uced by Brahm. \"From him proceeded the heavens and the eart h beneath. In the midst he placed the subtile ether , the light regions, and the permanent receptacle of the waters .\" Yet the natural universe is considered to have b een self- emanative, similar to the procession or development of the Sephirothic worlds from the first begotten son, who is at once the archetype and principle of all finite bein gs. In Hindu philosophy the soul, or rather spirit, is regarded as an efflux from the Deity, an emanation from the Light of Lights and destined ultimately to return to its great original. Subjected to the depraving effects of evil in time, the soul has to work out a purifying probation, an d if it fails in this it reincarnates until the work be completed. With r espect to creation p. 23 we learn, \"the entire world is an emanation from th e Deity, and therefore of one substance. The one on ly has existed from eternity. Everything we behold and ourselves t oo are portions of him. The Soul, the mind, the int ellect of man and all sentient creatures, are offshoots from the universal Soul, to which it is their fate to return . The human mind is impressed with a series of illusions which it consi ders as real, till reunited with the great fountain of truth.\" Of these illusions, the most potent is that of Ahamkara or t he feeling of self. By its influence and action the soul, when detached from its source, becomes ignorant of its o wn nature, origin and destiny, and erroneously cons iders itself as a separate and independent existence, and no longer a spark of the eternal fire or part of the univers al whole, a link in one unbroken and immeasurable chain. As in Kabba lah, the universe being of one substance and an ema nation from the Divine, it follows there can be no such th ing as matter in the gross and vulgar sense of the word. What we take to be attributes of matter are in effect so ma ny manifestations of spirit. The substance we call matter is and yet is not eternal from the point of view whence we reg ard it,--eternal when considered in its relation to Deity, non- eternal with regard to its figured states or phenom enal development and manifestation. Such are the fu ndamental views and propositions of Hindu philosophy displaye d with more or less clearness in the works above me ntioned, the oneness and coincidence of which with those of Kabbalah is, as we have stated, too plain to be den ied, and the only question remaining for explanation is, how cam e they to find a home in Palestine and become incor porated as elements in the Kabbalistic system of philosophy? There are three ways by which we may account for th eir sameness: (1) from the intercourse of the Jewis h rabbis during the Babylonian captivity with Zoroaster, who , as we have stated, drew his ideas primarily from India; (2) another probable mode of transmission was through t he commercial intercourse between India and Egypt. It is not incredible that the scholars of Alexandria should h ave visited Persia in their quest after the scienti fic and esoteric learning of the East, nor is it improbable that Zor oaster himself, along with his monarch, King Gushta p, at whose court he resided and taught, should have made a pil grimage to Alexandria as is stated in the Annals of Ammonius Marcellinus, an ancient Roman historian. This visit would afford opportunity to the sages and learned of that city of becoming p. 24 acquainted and conversant with the peculiar tenets and principles of Eastern religious philosophy, whi ch eventually found entrance into Palestine; (3) the most probabl e and likely is that it was conveyed thither by Bud dhist propagandists, who inaugurated those secret lodges of esoteric schools or societies such as those of t he Essenes and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Therapeutae, as they were termed.

Everywhere, where they penetrated, they ma de proselytes and inaugurated rites and ceremonies and introduced modes of dress and ecclesiastical orname nts, which afterwards became the accessories in the rituals and worship of Christian churches. Through these Buddhi st missionaries the basic ideas and principles of K abbalah were first implanted in a soil favorable for growth and after development. It was a time when national deca y had set in and old time systems of religion and philosophy wer e being shaken to their very foundations. The reign and regime of the old gods and goddesses and their worship wer e coming to an end and men's minds were craving aft er a purer faith, a nobler philosophy, a religion of light and truth, without which there is no real progress, no true progression in society. Kabbalah then sprung forth and manifest ed its existence, and whilst raising the mind above the phenomenal and temporal, introduced its followers, as did the Mystics afterwards in the dark ages, int o a new world of thought, teaching them their true position in th e universe and their real relationship to the divin e Being in whom and through whom we live and move and have our bein g. Amidst this general darkness and mental uncertit ude, this eclipse of faith and hope, Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai elaborated his philosophy of life, teaching the div inity of man as a derivation, or rather an emanation, from En Soph the \"Boundless One,\" the one unknown yet omnipresen t Being. To whom, no high, no low, no great, no small, He fills, He bounds, connects and equals all. p. 25 Sustains heaven's myriad orbs and all their suns From seeming evil, still educing good And better thence again, and better still In infinite progression. In doing this, and infusing into the mind and heart of man new and lofty ideas of human existence, Rab bi Simeon has done good service to humanity, and contributed both directly and indirectly to the overthrow of th at system of polytheism which for long ages had enervated and de praved the moral life of nations. He lived not in v ain, nor did his philosophy perish with him. Cherished and prese rved by his followers, it was handed down and becam e the basis of all esoteric teachings imparted in the secret lo dges of the Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and Mystics t hroughout the dark and mediaeval ages, so that his epitaph may we ll be \"though dead, he speaketh still.\" Having now sketched and outlined the theoretical pa rt of Kabbalah as found in The Zohar, we will concl ude by giving a short account of the practical, which is u sually divided under two heads, viz., the Exegetica l applied to the interpretation of the occult meaning of holy script ure, and the Thaumaturgic, comprising rules and met hods for producing certain preternatural results in the cure of diseases and the exercise of Magical rites and practices. Exegetical Kabbalah is founded on the assumption as before stated that Moses received from the Lord on Mount Sinai not only the words of the law, but also the k ey to unlock and reveal the mysteries enwrapped and hidden in each section, verse, letter, point, and accent of t he Pentateuch, and that this key has been handed do wn through wise men who had qualified themselves for its reception. This system of exegesis or explanation is threefol d, and arranged under the heads of Gematria , Notarikon , and Temura , each of which we will now describe. Gematria deals with the numerical value and power o f letters, their forms, and sometimes their situati on in a word, and is either arithmetical or figurative. In arithm etical gematria each letter has its numerical value . One word whose letters are equivalent to those of another may be a ccepted as an explanation of that other. For instan ce, Genesis, ch. I. V. 1, Brashith bara in the beginning created = 1 116, also the words, berash hashanah nibra (in the beginning of the year was created) = 1116. Therefore the creation to ok place in September, in which month the Jewish Ne w Year commences. So in Genesis xlix: 10, the words yabo s chilo (shall come to Shiloh), = 358, and meshiach p. 26 [paragraph continues] (Messiah) 358. Therefore Shiloh is the Messiah. Fi gurative gematria is employed in speculations on the letters which (from accident, b ut as the Kabbalists affirm, from divine design) ar e greater or smaller, reversed or inverted in the manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures. An instance of this occurs in Numbers x: 35. \"And when the ark went forward,\" the letter nun in the word arun (ark) is written the wrong way of turned back to show the loving warning of God to the people, Ag ain, in Genesis xi.: 1, \"and the people became as m urmurers.\" The nun in the word mthannanim (murmurers) is also written backwards to show the perverse turning of t he people from God, and thus are these two places written in every true Hebrew Bible throughout the world. Anoth er branch of figurative gematria is called architectonical, cons isting of mystical calculations on the size, form, and dimensions of the holy temple, the tabernacle in the wilderness, and the future temple described in Ezekiel, of whic h some very curious and most interesting particulars are given in Sheckard's Bechinath Happerushim (select comment s)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Notarikon is used when one letter is made to signif y an entire thing or person. The term is taken from the practice of notaries in abbreviating words, though others deriv e it from notare, to note. Thus a single word is fo rmed from the first or last letters of several words, as in Genes is i.: 3, the finals of the words bars elohim laaso th, which God created and made = amth. Another instance is the wo rd agla, which, with the Tetragrammaton or holy nam e, was, as the Kabbalists say, inscribed on Magen David or the Shield of David, and is formed by taking the initi als of the words atta gibbor leolom adonai (thou art, O Lord, eternally mighty). Temura signifies permutation. That is, the intercha nge of letters by various methods, such as that kno wn as Athbash, in which one word is composed that shall answer to another by inverting the order of the letters as th ey stand in the alphabet, making the last letter Th stand for the f irst and so answer to A, then Sh to correspond with B, and so on in the subjoined order: Athbash . A, B, G, D, H, V, Z, Bh, T, Y, C, Th, Sh, R, K, Ts, P, H, S, N, M, L. [paragraph continues] By this method the meaning of Jeremiah li: 1, lb k my (in midst of them that rise up against me) becomes Chasdim (Chaldeans). Another method is (the re are 22 of them): p. 27 Albam . A, B, G, D, H, V, Z, Ch, T. Y, C, L, M, N, S, H, P, Ts, K, R, Sh, Th. [paragraph continues] By which the alphabet is divided into two equal pa rts, and the first letter interchanged with the eleventh, the second with the twelfth; thus Isaiah vii: 6, the word T B A L Tabeel becomes Ramla, the King of Israel. Sometimes letters of a word may be transpos ed as to compose another word as Mlachy (my angel) may be made Michael (the angel Michael). Thaumaturgic Kabbalah is founded on the assumption that a certain virtue or energy is inherent in the words and letters of the Scriptures, which on the pronunciati on of them with a specific and steadfast purpose wi ll communicate itself to spiritual or heavenly powers, of which th ose names, words, and letters, are the symbols, pro ducing effects which to those who have no knowledge of the occult power of vibrations would be altogether deemed incr edible. Yet in our own experience have we met with instance s of the occult power of words and symbols of a mos t extraordinary character, the results of which were most pronounced and beneficial. Kabbalists strongly affirm that by such means effects are produced in the higher or noumenal world which become expressed and manifest ed in the changes sought to be accomplished in this our pheno menal and lower life. It was and still is an articl e of Jewish belief that he who can rightly pronounce the Tetrag rammaton. or holy name, is able to do wonders and p roduce miraculous effects. The parts of Scripture employed for this purpose are those which contain or are by the preceding modes made to be expressive of the divine names and those of angels and the Sephiroth, each of which c orresponds with a part or member of the human body. The interr elation of these names is as follows: Sephiroth Divine Name Angels Parts of Body Kether Ehyeh Chaioth Brain Hochma Jah Ophanim Lungs Binah Jehovah Arelim Heart Chesed El Chasmalim Stomach Geburah Eloah Seraphim Liver Tiphereth Elohim Malachim Gall Netzach Jehovah Zabaoth Tarsheesim Spleen Hod Elohim Zabaoth Beni Elohim Reins Yesod El Chai Cherubim Genitalia, Mas. Malkuth Adonai Ishim Genitalia, Fem. p. 28 In the cure of diseases, the name of the heavenly p ower is invoked which corresponds to that part of t he body affected, or the member to be healed. These names a re sometimes, together with what are termed the sig natures of the angels, inscribed on kemeoth or amulets of vari ous kinds, and constructed according to certain rul es, which Paracelsus in his magical works has outlined. They are also given in such Kabbalistic works as The Six th Book of Moses, Shemosh Tehillim, and others. That part of p ractical Kabbalah relating to the conjuration and e vocation of good spirits and angelic beings is denominated Theu rgy or White Magic. That referring to the invocatio n of evil"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"powers is called Goety or Black Magic, is found in the frightful grimoires of the Middle Ages. It must , however, be admitted that the most learned and enlightened Kabb alists ignore this latter entirely, holding it as a n abomination, and denounce both the study and practice of it as h aving no connection whatever with the sublime Kabba lah elaborated by Rabbi Simeon. Of the many learned Kabbalists who have written on this subject, the best and most esteemed are Rabbi Nachmanides, whose Shoshan Sodoth, \"The Lily of Sec rets,\" is a profound treatise on the powers of lett ers, names, and numbers. Gikatilla, author of Ganath Egos, \"The Garden of Nuts,\" an introduction to the doctrines of Kabbalah, also of Sheaarey Zedek, \"The Gates of Righteousness on the ten Sephiroth.\" On Kabbalistic philosophy t he greatest and most famed are Moses Corduero, who composed Par edis Rimmonim, \"The Garden of Pomegranates,\" and Is aac de Luria, who spent his whole life in the study, te aching and exposition of Kabbalah. His great work, entitled Etz Chaim, \"The Tree of Life,\" edited and published p. 29 by Vital, will ever remain a monument of his learni ng and knowledge of Kabbalistic Science. The Shefer Tal,, Shower of Dew,\" is a well-known and excellent work by Rabbi Shabbethai Horowitz, and is often referred to as a text-book by students, as also Chesed le Abraham, \" Mercy to Abraham,\" by Abraham Asulai, a most remark able work in seven gates or chapters, dealing with the m ysteries of the law, the microcosm, hell, paradise, the transmigrations of the soul, demonology and guardia n angels, hidden powers and forces, etc. Another im portant work, being the first printed book on Kabbalah, is Derech Emuna, \"The Path of Faith,\" by Meir ben Gabb ai, and treats in the form of dialogue on the Sephiroth, wh ich will eventually appear in \"The Word,\" for the f irst time in English. And last, though not least, is the Zohar i tself, which, when first published in Europe by Leo de Modena in the twelfth century, produced a wide and profound i mpression in the learned world, including popes, ec clesiastics, professors in all the most noted universities. Scho lars everywhere read and studied it, through whom i ts teachings and philosophy were adopted as appears in many theo logical works, published in that and the succeeding centuries, both Christian and Jewish. The chief non-Jewish aut hors of works on Kabbalah are Picus de Mirandola, \"Conclusions Kabbalisticce\"; Reuchlin, \"de Arte Kab balistica\"; Brucker, \"Historia Philosophiae\"; Rosen roth, \"Kabbalah Denudata,\" comprising Latin translations of large portions of the Zohar, with commentaries, glossaries, and a large mass of interesting information on the transcendental philosophy of the Jews; Basnage, \"Hi storie des Hebreux,\" which has been translated into English. T he works of Joel, and Jost, on Jewish sects, in Ger man, are excellent for reference on Kabbalistic history. A F rench \"Systeime dala Kabbalah,\" in French, is well worth reading. Count Mac Gregor Mathers--Kabbalah Unveiled--which, though embracing only a part of the Zohar, is a mo st excellent work, especially the introduction and ver y learned notes, which no one but a great Kabbalist could have compiled. To all these must be added the Edipus Egy ptiacus, a really stupendous work by Athanasius Kir cher, a most learned and profoundly erudite scholar, whose multifarious works comprise twenty-three folio volu mes, chiefly on philosophical, scientific and literary s ubjects. Having now emerged from out of the mazes of this la byrinthine subject of Kabbalah, the question may be asked, p. 30 how is it that a work like The Zohar has been suffe red to drop out of popular notice so as to become c omparatively unknown, except to a few ardent and zealous student s. During the last century a great amount of intere st was exhibited by savants and scholars in the science of comparative Religion and the sacred books of all n ations, especially those of ancient Persia, Egypt, and Indi a, were subjects of profound researches and investi gations by learned Orientalists such as Max Muller, Whitney, a nd a host of others, all noted for their philosophi cal and literary attainments. But The Zohar, the Book of Light, has been passed by, ignored and unappreciated, so that its existence is scarcely known. What is the reason for such negl ect, so strange and anomalous? Among the many reaso ns that may be advanced in explanation of this universal ne glect is the fact that the study and comprehension of this book demand, from students in general qualifications the y do not possess, viz., a knowledge of occultism an d an acquaintance with those correspondences and analogi es which are an essential sine qua non in the acquisition of spiritual science and learning. The natural man, as St. Paul observed centuries ago, however learned a nd advanced in art and science, cannot understand the things of th e spirit, nay, he will frequently have to quit or r id himself of many preconceived notions and prejudices, the result of his learning, and become as teachable as a little c hild ere he eau take a single step or advance in spiritual science and philosophy. The majority of students i n public colleges and institutions, imbued with the commercial spirit of the age, are actuated in their labors and studies g reatly by motives of gain, and the acquisition of wealth and position , are content and willing to follow in the world's train instead of becoming its leaders, its guides, and directors to a higher and truer knowledge of the philosophy of h uman life and existence. It has not always been so. Great and lea rned and true men there have been, who in the study of The Zohar found a philosophy which expanded their minds and p urified their natures from the defilement of those mercenary motives, which are at the present time so rampant a nd prevalent in all classes and grades of society. There are,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"however, looming up in the mental horizon of the wo rld, indications of a deep and earnest desire and c raving after a learning that shall ennoble human nature and not le ad it into bypaths of error and illusion. Men are o bserving and detecting in the study of past systems of religion and philosophy something that was true, and therefo re worth retaining and cherishing, and also recognizing that p. 31 the end, the aim, and object of all of them, was th e renovation and purification of human nature and i ts exaltation to a higher plane of thought and experience. This was their chief raison d’etre as formulated and express ed in The Zohar. In it, as in a deep mine, are to be found em bedded veins and nuggets of valuable truths more pr ecious than gold or rubies, but which must he delved for and ex cavated as miners toil and delve for gold and other minerals. All knowledge that is worth having, that which enriches and endows us with a wealth of power and strength to conquer nature and attain the goal of our destiny, implies labor and toil protracted and ofttimes wearying; in volves self- sacrifice and self-denial, frequently painful and t rying, but when acquired, gives us the right to tak e of \"the tree of life\" whose fruits and leaves in the symbolic words of the Apocalypse are for the healing of the natio ns. This knowledge it is that frees us from the trammels and bondage of sensual desire and indulgence and bring s in its train self-conquest, the greatest of all victories, the n oblest of all human achievements. Some years ago, a great general lay mortally wounded on his pallet bed within his t ent, surrounded by brother officers and comrades on many a hard fought field of battle. The sands of life were fast running out. To cheer his last moments some one wh ispered, \"Bring the record of his victories and read it to h im ere he leaves us.\" It was brought and read. Scar cely was it finished when the departing warrior with a painful effort raised himself up on his elbow and said: \"Th ere is one victory unrecorded.\" And to their questions of asto nishment, when and where it occurred, he replied: \" On such a day I conquered myself,\" and with these words, the last he uttered, that great soul entered into the rest that remaineth for all of us who achieve the victory over Self. Let th is be realized, then commences the true life within us, the great object of all our incarnations. May we learn the \"o pen sesame\" of the higher life, which is the ultima te heritage and acquisition to be enjoyed by all mankind. 'The stru ggle to attain to it is arduous and attended with c onflicts of inward anguish and pain known only to the combatant . It is, however, a struggle that ennobles and stre ngthens us to hear and suffer, silently and uncomplaining, life's heavy burden of sorrows, and disappointments, to s tand calm, steadfast and unmoved amidst the debris and wreckag e of hopes blighted and withered, of fairy visions dispelled and faded away, of aspirations, desires, longings and a nticipations unrealized, for the gold law, or, in o ther words, the divine is p. 32 with us and in us, teaching us, educating us, prepa ring and qualifying us all for something better and grander, something more enduring and lasting than the fleeti ng hopes and dreams of the past, a something which in the words of the saintly Spinoza is the enjoyment and partici pation of the \"One true, and immutable life,\" man's highest happiness and the source of that tranquility of mind and soul which springs from the. intuitive knowledge and perception of the divine in nature as' also in ours elves. Then is it that old things pass away and all things become new, and to us again the words of that wonderful i and occult book, the Apocalypse, or the Book of Rev elation, there is for us no more death, and sorrow and crying no m ore, for the tabernacle of the divine life is withi n us, transforming us into children of Zohar, or Light, t hat shall never become dimmed throughout all Lyons of time, then also, even in our present incarnation, \"Though too weak to tread the ways of truth This age fall back to old idolatry, Though men return to servitude a fact As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame By nations sink together, we shall still Find solace--knowing what we have learned to know Rich in true happiness, if allowed to be Faithful alike in forwarding a day Of greater Light, joint laborers in the work Of their deliverance, surely yet to come, Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak A lasting inspiration, sanctified By reason, blest by faith; what we know and love Others will love, and we will teach them how; Instruct them how the soul of man becomes A thousand times more beautiful than the earth On which we live and dwell above this frame of thin gs"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In light and beauty exalted, as it is itself Of quality and fabric more divine.\" End of Introduction . THE SEPHER HA-ZOHAR; OR, THE BOOK OF LIGHT. Containing the doctrines of Kabbalah, together with the discourses and teachings of its author, the Ka bbalist, Rabbi ben Simeon, and now for the first time translated i nto English, with notes, references and expository remarks. BY NURHO DE MANHAR. INTRODUCTION. THE LILY. THE students of Rabbi Simeon were assembled togethe r and sitting in silence, waiting for the master to begin his discourse. At length Rabbi Simeon spake, and said: \"As a lily amongst the thorns.\"Cant. 2:2 This word lily, what doth it mean and symbolize? It symbolizes the congr egation of Israel; and as lilies are either red or white in color, so the members of this congregation are divided into t wo classes, distinguished by their rigorous justice and uprightness, or by their gentleness, kindness and c ompassion. These are environed about with thirteen ways or degrees of mercy, as the lily has thirteen leaves s urrounding it on all sides. Furthermore, intervenin g between the first and second Elohim or Alhim, mentioned in Gene sis, are thirteen words corresponding to these thir teen leaves of the lily and the degrees of mercy surrounding the c ongregation of Israel. The divine name Alhim is men tioned again, and wherefore? In order to show the symbolic meanin g of the five strong leaves which surround the lily , the occult meaning of which has reference to the five ways of salvation, corresponding to five gates of mercy. Re specting this mystery of five, it is written: \"I will take the cu p of salvation,\"Ps. 116:13 which is the cup of bles sing, and which must stand or repose upon five fingers only, simila r to the lily supported and sustained by its five s trong leaves. For this reason the lily symbolizes the cup of blessing , as there are five words between the second and th e third Alhim p. 34 mentioned in the Book of Genesis. One of these word s is A U R, meaning light. This light was treated a nd became enclosed as an embyro in the Berith , or covenant, and, entering into the lily as a pri nciple of life, 1a-1b made it fruitful, and this is what is called in Scripture \" fruit tree, yielding fruit whose seed is in itself\" ;Gen. 1:29 and as this life principle, entering into the Berith , caused itself to become manifested in forty-two k inds of second matter, so has it produced the Shemhamphorash , the great and ineffable divine name of God, compo sed of forty-two letters, which operated in the creation of the world. THE REDEMPTION OF HUMANITY. Rabbi Simeon spake again: \"The Flowers appear on th e earth.\"Cant. 2:12 By flowers is signified the app earance of created beings on the earth. When did they appear? On the third day, when it is written: \"The earth fi rst brought forth.\" Then the flowers appeared on that day. \"The time of singing or of commingled voices and cries and noises is come,\" indicates the fourth day of creation, in whi ch took place the excision of the Aretzim (the terr ible one, or demons). For this reason the word Moroth (lights) i s found without V and written M A R Th, meaning cur se, or malediction. \"The voice of the turtle\" refers to th e fifth day, when it is written: \"The waters brough t forth abundantly, and etc.,\" for the generation of create d beings. On the sixth day it was said: \"Let us mak e man,\" who in after-time would say: \"Let us hear, before let us d o or make.\" \"In our land\" is meant the Sabbath, sym bol or type of the land of life, the world of spirits or souls, th e world of resurrections or rising up to a higher l ife. \"The flowers\" were the fathers or pitris whose souls pre-existed in the Divine Thought, and, entering into the world to come, became concealed and hidden therein. From thence th ey came forth, becoming incarnated in prophets of t ruth. When Joseph was born they were concealed and unrecognize d in him, and when he entered into the holy land he presided over them and ruled there; so then they became know n. When did this occur? To this question Scripture gives answer: when the Iris, or rainbow, first appeared i n the world. Then was the time of the excision or c utting of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"brutal and savage and sinful from the face of the e arth. Why, then, did they not perish? Why were they preserved? Because the flowers then p. 35 appeared on the earth. If they had not appeared, th ey, the brutal and sinful ones, would have become e xtinct and the world would have ceased its existence. Who, then, e stablished the world and caused the fathers to appe ar? It was the voice or cry of the little ones , or students of the law, and it was owing to them that the world now subsists. EXPLANATORY NOTES AND REMARKS. In these two first sections of the introduction to the Zohar are abstruse intimations and references t o the doctrine of Light, which enters so largely as an element in the systems of ancient Eastern philosophy, especially that of the Persians, with whom the Jews had at one time such i ntimate relations. Light is the primal emanation of the Divine, from which and by which all things visible and invi sible have originated. From out of that Light have they all come forth, and into it will they return when the great drama of existence is completed and the tragedy of life comes to an end. Meanwhile the Light that enlighteneth every ma n that cometh into the world to play each his or he r part, is accessible to all, irrespective of artificial condi tions or the distinctions of human society. Upon ou r own measure of receptivity of it depends our inner development and evolution to higher planes of life; of loftier, cl earer and more accurate views of truth that free us from the influ ence of external contaminations by purifying and sp iritualizing the animal or lower nature within us. It is the one her itage common alike to king or peasant, noble or ign oble, learned or illiterate, rich or poor, and he who is endowed wit h and knows most of it ranks higher in the scale of existence and approximates nearer and closer to the Divine, in wh om we all live and move and have life, whether we u se it for the good and happiness of others or trifle and fritter it away as foolish spendthrifts who are ignorant of the value and worth of money. It was this Light that the great Ge rman, Goethe, in his last words, craved and desired : \"Light! More Light!\" And this is the Light that Rabbi Simeon ref ers to all through the pages of this remarkable boo k, in which we shall meet with many allusions to it of great inter est, both to the general and the theosophic reader. Kabbalists affirm that there were thirty-two Alhim engaged in the wor k of creation as executors of the divine will. They correspond to the Dhyan Chohans p. 36 in Hindu philosophy. By the lily, with thirteen lea ves, is occultly meant the twelve avatars, or incar nations, of divine messengers, six of whom are Cabiri, ministers of ka rmic justice for the chastisement of nations; and s ix of them are Messiahs; their emblem is a lily, whose color is wh ite, as seen in ancient paintings of The Annunciati on, in which the Angel Gabriel holds a lily in his hand. The thi rteenth is their great chief and lord, by whom they have been trained and commissioned and sent forth on the grea t work of spiritual enlightenment of the nations. I n Eastern philosophy he is known as the \"Great Sacrifice,\" th e \"Silent Watcher,\" who will not vacate his post un til the last scion of humanity, agonizing and struggling with it s weakness and infirmities to overcome self and acc omplish its destiny, finds its way to him at last. We have also here hints of the state of mankind in its primary stages, when the cry of the Atzerim, the terrible or terrorizing one s, resounded on the earth, and which lasted until t he fathers , or divine teachers, came and led humanity on to the up ward track of light and civilization. Then the worl d became steadied or established, and students of the divine law of the universe and of the divine government o f humanity became numerous, their voices and teachings going o ut unto the ends of the world; and then, as it is w ritten: \"Great was the company of the preachers\" of truth and righ teousness. By the \"little ones\" are meant student initiates, o f which class St. Paul was one. Before his initiati on his name was called Saul, but after his initiateship be became k nown as Paulus--the little one. There are various o ther expositions of these two sections by Kabbalists, but so abstrus ely worded and expressed in metaphysical terms and language that none but those who have a wide and extended knowled ge of Hebrew and its cognate language would be able to understand and appreciate them. For greater elucidation and a clearer understanding of the Briatic or creative Alhim, we give them in their order as set forth in Kabbalistic writings: (1) In the beginning Alhim created. (2) And the spi rit of Alhim hovered or brooded. (3) And Alhim said : \"Let there be light.\" (4) And Alhim saw the light. (5) And Alh im divided between the light. (6) And Alhim called the light Day . (7) And Alhim said: \"Let there be a firmament.\" ( S) And Alhim made the firmament. (9) And Alhim call ed the firmament Heaven . (10) Alhim said: \"Let the waters he gathered toge ther.\" p. 37 [paragraph continues] (11) Alhim called the dry land Earth . (12) And Alhim saw it was good. (13) Alhim said: \"Let the earth bring forth.\" (14) And Alhim saw it was g ood. (15) And Alhim said: \"Let there be lights.\" (1 6) Alhim made two lights. (17) And Alhim placed them in the firmament of the heavens. (18) And Alhim saw it was good. (19) Alhim said: \"Let the waters bring forth.\" (20) Alhim created the whales. (21) And Alhim saw it wa s good. (22)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"And Alhim blessed them, saying: \"Be fruitful and mu ltiply.\" (23) Alhim said: \"Let the earth bring fort h.\" (24) Alhim made the beasts of the earth. (25) And Alhim saw it was good. (26) Alhim said: \"Let us make man.\" (27) And Alhim created the man. (28) In the form or image of Alhim created he him. (29) Alhim blessed them. (30) Alhi m said: \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" (31) Alhim said: \"Behold! l have given to you.\" (32) And Alhim saw all that he had made. The English equivalents of the thirteen words inter vening between the first and second Alhim are as fo llows: The heavens, the earth, earth was Tohu vabohu, darkness upon face, abyss (or great deep) Spirit. The five words between the second and third Alhim are: \"Hovered, upon, fac e, waters, said.\" The expression, \"Congregation of Israel,\" in the fi rst instance, refers to the first born sons of Ligh t, or, as they are termed in the Book of Job, the morning stars, who, along with the Sons of Alhim, sang their song of pr aise at the creation of the world. In an extended sense, it inc ludes the true children of light who have attained unto the Divine Life THE OCCULT ORIGIN OF ALHIM. Rabbi Eliezar spoke, and said: \"Lift up your eyes o n high and behold who hath created these.\"Isa. 40:2 6 Lift up your eyes on high. Where? To the place whither all eyes are turned. There is the pathakh azeen , or opening of eyes. There you will recognize the mysterious Ancient One who c reated these and is the object of research. And who is he? It is Mi (who) that is called the summit of the heavens a bove, for all things exist by his will. Because he is the object concealed and invisible after which all seek. There fore is this mysterious being called Who (Mi), and beyond him search in vain. Rut at the other extremity is anoth er being known as What! (Mah). What distinguishes t he one from the other? Mi (who), the concealed and hidden One, is p. 38 he whom all created beings are seeking to know, but after all their efforts and endeavors, by the gain ing of knowledge, they only come at last to Mah (the what) . Then, what do we know, What understanding of him have we? What have we found out or discovered, Truly, all is mysterious, as at first., and this is what the Scr ipture refers to where it is written: \" Mah (what) I take thee to witness .\" \" Mah (what) shall I liken thee to? \" When the temple at Jerusalem was ravaged and destroyed there was heard a voice crying aloud: \" What shall I testify concerning thee? Lam. 2:13 For from the beginning of creation have I testified to thee.\" Also, is it written: \" I call heaven and earth this day to record .\"Deut. 30:19 \" Mah (what) shall be likened unto thee .\" \" I will crown thee with crowns of holiness and make thee to rule over the world .\" So that it shall be said: \" Is this the city called Beautiful, etc? \"Lam 2:15 \" This is Jerusalem, the city most compacted in beaut y .\" \" Mah (what) shall equal thee? \" That is, it shall ascend on high, where thou art sitting, and even as thou o bservest below, the holy people do not now enter th e holy city; so I say unto thee I will not ascend there until the p eople have entered into thy walls below. Let this c onsole and comfort thee. I will not ascend until, under the fo rm of Mah, I become like thee in all things. If the overflow of thy afflictions be like that of the sea, and if thou sa y there is no healing or remedy for thee, thou thin kest wrongly. Mi (who) shall heal thee? This is the highest scale of the mystery--the mystery of the being, upon whom d ependeth all things. He shall heal and strengthen thee. Mi of th e heavens above is the highest pole, Mah of the hea vens below is the lower pole, and the heritage of Jacob stands be tween these extremities of the heavensEx. 27:28--Mi (who) and Mah (what). This is the meaning of the words \" Who (Mi) created these? \" Then Rabbi Simeon, interrupting, spake, and said: \" Eliezar, my son! cease thy interpretations of the w ords, for a profound mystery is about to be revealed, which the children of the world know nothing of, even onto t his day.\" Rabbi Eliezar obeyed, and ceased speaking. Rabbi Simeon for a moment was silent, and then said : \"Eliezar, my son, what is the meaning of Aleh (th ese)? If thou sayest it includes the stars, constellations and ot her heavenly bodies which are visible and seen alwa ys to the eye of man and have been created by Mah, as it is written, \" By the word of God p. 39 1b-2b the heavens were made .\" Ps. 33:6 Aleh (these) cannot refer to things inv isible, but to those that are seen. The mysterious meaning of the word was revealed to me o ne day that I was standing by the seashore, when El ijah, the prophet, suddenly appeared and said unto me: Rabbi! knowest thou what Aleh (these things) means? And I answered and said it means the heavens and their ho sts, the work of the Holy One, blessed be He, which it behooves every man to study as it is written: \" When I consider the heavens the work of that finger s, etc .\"Ps. 8:3 \" Oh, Lord, our God how excellent is thy name in all the earth! \"Ps. 8:9 Rabbi! said Elijah, this word is an occult word, and was revealed and explained in the heavenly college thus . When the Most Secret One wished to reveal himself , He first created a point, and it became a divine Thought, in which were the ideas of all created things and for ms of all things, and also that holy, glorious Light wherein was the Holy of Holies--a structure of magnificent and loft y dimensions, the work of that divine Thought and the beginning, or cornerstone, to this structure, hidden and conce aled in the name as yet ineffable find known only as Mi (who), who wished to manifest itself and to be called by a name and"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"become arrayed and clothed with a precious and resp lendent garment. He therefore created Aleh (these t hings), which then became a part of the divine name; for th ese words, joined and associated together, form Alh im, which is composed of Aleh (these things), and Mi reversed an d which existed not previous to this conjunction. To this mystery the worshippers of the golden calf alluded when they cried: \"Aleh is thy God, Oh, Isra el! As on the work of creation, Mi remains conjoined with Aleh (t hese), so in the name Alhim they are always insepar able. And by reason of this unity the world abides as it is h aving thus spoken, Elijah disappeared, and I saw hi m no more. It is from him I learned the meaning of this mystery of M i, Aleh and Alhim.\" Rabbi Eliezar and the rest of the students went, an d prostrating themselves before their master, said: \"If we had come into the world only to hear and understand the meaning of these words, we should be satisfied.\" R abbi Simeon then commenced speaking again, and said: \"Thus the heaven and all its hosts have been created by means of Mah, for it is written: \" When I behold the heavens. the work of that fingers , etc. Oh, Lord, our God, Mah (what) that name is excellent in all the earth .\"Ps. 8:3 Thou who hast set thy glory above the hea vens, signifying and referring p. 40 to the ascension of Aleh in Mi, after creating one for the other and forming one name. Thus mean the w ords berashith, bara. Alhim, God, in the beginning creat ed Alhim. This junction of the two words being effe cted, the mother lent the daughter her garments of splendor 2 a and arrayed her in her jewels; and when was this? When all the males appeared before Alhim (God) as it is written: \" All the males, three times a year shall they presen t themselves before the Lord, Alhim .\"Ex. 34:23 Alhim is here called Adon, or Lord, as it is written: \" Behold the ark of the covenant, Adon of all the earth .\"Jos. 3:11 So the H from Mah, representing the fem ale principle, went forth and was replaced by I (representing the male principle) fro m Mi, and thus Alhim is formed. This is the signifi cation of the words \" When I remember Aleh, I pour out my soul within me .\"Ps. 43:4 \" I have remembered this and have shed tears .\" That the letters, emanating one from the other, mig ht produce Aleh and then form Alhim, according as i t is written: \" I will bring them down from on high into the house of Alhim below ,\" in order to form an Alhim like Alhim above. How? By songs and thanksgiving. Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking, and his son, Rabbi Eliezar, exclaimed: \" My silence has resulted in the building of a temple ab ove and a temple below, and the old proverb has bee n realized--'if speech is worth a shekel, silence is worth two.' If my speech was worth a shekel, my silence was worth two; for I have learned that two worlds have been created--the heavenly and the earthly--at the same tame.\" Rabbi Simeon spake again: We will explain the words following those which have been quoted and explain ed: \"That bringeth out their host by number.\" There are two p ersonalities inferred, viz.: Mi and Mah---the one a bove, the other below. That above says \" Bringeth out the host by number .\"Is. 40:26 It must be confessed there is none like unto hire, yet is he who bringeth forth bread from the earth, though below, one and the same. By number, amountin g to six hundred thousand, \"who stand together as one man.\" \" He calls them by name .\" If you say by their own special name, He calls them. It is not so, because Aleh had not a s yet entered into the divine name, and He was only known as Mi, and was then creating things in their own nature, a nd at the same time hidden and concealed in him. Bu t as soon as Alhim was formed, as stated before, from Aleh, Mi, then, by virtue of this name, he created the univer se. This is the p. 41 2a-2b meaning of the words: \" He called by the name ,\"Ex. 31:2 Is 40:26 his name. \" By the greatness of his might \"; that is, by the divine will, which in a hidden a nd mysterious manner and according to its good pleasure worketh a nd doeth all things both in the world above and the world below. \" Not one faileth ,\" meaning that of the host of six hundred thousand created and produced by the power of the name Alhim, not one is wanting or missing. Like the children of Israel, who, although punished and aff licted by plagues, yet always continued undiminished in numbe r as they went out of Egypt, not one was missing of their six hundred thousand strong; and so shall it be with th e host, both above and below, not one shall be want ing. THE MYSTICISM OF THE ALPHABET. Rabbi Chananya spake, and said: \"Before creation be gan, the alphabetical letters were in reversed orde r; thus, the two first words in the Book of Genesis, berashith, bara, begin with B; the next two, Alhim, ath, with A. Why did it not commence with A, the first letter? The reason o f this inversion is as follows: For two thousand ye ars before the creation of the world the letters were concealed an d hidden, being objects of divine pleasure and deli ght. \"When the Divine Being, however, willed to create t he world, all the letters appeared before his prese nce in their reverse order. Th first ascended and. said: 'Lord of the Universe! l et it please thee to create the world by me, as I a m the final letter of the word Emeth (truth), which is graven on thy signet ring. Thou thyself art called Emeth , and therefore it will become thee, the great King, to b egin and create the world by me.' Said the Holy One (blessed be He): 'Thou, oh, Teth, are indeed worthy, but I cann ot create the world by thee; for thou art destined to be not only the characteristic emblem borne by faithful student s of the law, from beginning to end, but also the a ssociate of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Maveth (death), of which thou art the final letter. There fore the creation of the world cannot, must not, be through thee.' \"After Th had disappeared, Sh ascended and said: 'I pray thee, Lord of the Unive rse, as bearing thy great name Shaddai (almighty), to create the world by me, by the holy name that becometh thee only.' Said the Holy One: 'Thou art truly, oh, Schin , worthy, pure and true; but letters that go to for m lying p. 42 and falsehood will associate themselves with thee, viz.: Koph (Q) and Resh (R), and with thee will make up SheQeR (a lie), Falsehood, in order that it may be receive d and credited, some first with the appearance of t ruth ( Sh ), which thou representest, and for this reason I will not c reate the world by thee.' So Schin departed and Q and R , having heard these words, dared not present themselves bef ore the divine presence. 2b-3a \" TZ then went before him, saying: 'Because I mark the Zaddikim (the righteous), and thou thyself nearest me in thy name, Zaddik (righteous), and also it is wri tten \" The righteous Lord loveth righteousness ,\"Ps. 9:8 it will become thee to create the world by me.' Then said t he Holy One: \"Zaddi, Zaddi, thou art truly righteou s, but thou must keep thyself concealed, and thy occult meaning must not be made known or become revealed; and the refore thou must not be used in the creation of the world. Thy original form was a rod, symbol of the female principle, surmounted by Yod, a letter of the holy Name, and a lso of the Holy Covenant, and emblem of the male pr inciple. (By this, reference is made to the first man, who w as androgynous, with faces turning one to the right , the other to the left, as symbolized in the figure of Zaddi in t he Hebrew alphabet). But the time will come that th ou shall be divided, and thy faces shall then be turned to each other.' \"Zaddi then departed, and P ascended and said: 'I am the beginning of the salv ation ( P eragna) and deliverance ( P eduth) thou will execute in the world. It will be f itting to create it by me.' 'Thou art worthy,' repl ied the Holy One, 'but thou also givest rise to Evil ( P eshang), and in thy form resemblest those animals w ho walk with drooping heads, like wicked men who go about with bowed heads and e xtended hands. I will not, therefore, create the wo rld by thee.' \"To the letter Ayin , the initial of the word Avon (iniquity), though it claimed the origination of A nava (Modesty), the holy One said: 'I shall not create the world by the e.' And forthwith Ayin departed. \" S then went and pleaded: 'I am near ( Samich ) to the fallen ones, as it is written: \"The Lord u pholdeth (soumekh) all them that fall.\"'Ps. 145:14 'Thou must return, Sami ch, to thy place,' was the reply of the Holy One, ' and must not leave it; for if thou dost, what will become of the fallen, who will need and look to thee for aid and support?' p. 43 \"Samich forthwith returned, and was followed by N , who said: 'Oh, thou Holy One! that thou mayest be venerated in praises (Nura tehillim), and also because the prais e of the righteous will be a Nava (delight), let it please thee to create the world by me.' To whom he replied: ' Nun , return thou to thy place with the fallen ( N ephelim), for whose sake Samich hath gone back to her place, and lean f or support upon her.' \" M then followed after, saying: 'Thou wilt by me be c alled Melech (King).' 'Truly so,' said He, 'but I will not, for all that, create the world by thee. Go back at once to thy place with thy companion letters, L and CH ; for there must be a King, and for the world to be without one would n ot be seemly.'\" p. 44 THE MYSTERY OF THE ALPHABET. ( Continued .) AT that moment bh descended from off the throne of light and splendor, exclaiming: \"I am thy glory, cr eate the world by me.\" As it stood trembling with excitement before the Holy One, two hundred thousand worlds t ogether with the throne itself were seized with a sudden tr emor and seemed ready to fall. \"Caph, Caph!\" cried the Holy One, \"what hast thou done? I will not create the world b y thee, for thou beginnest bhala (ruin, loss). Retu rn at once to thy place on the throne of glory and abide there!\" Then Caph retired and went back to its place. I next appeared and claimed that being the initial letter in the divine name IHVH, it was the best for the work of creation. But the Holy One replied: \"Let it suffice thee to be what thou art, chief letter in my name and foremost in all my designs, thou must remain where and as thou art!\" Then came I and spake before the Eternal One: \"Crea te the world by me, for in me alone is thy goodness (Tobh) and uprightness, both attributes of thee.\" \"I will not, Oh Teth,\" replied the Holy One, \"use thee in the c reation of the world, because the goodness within thee is hidden a nd concealed from sight as it is written, \" How great is thy goodness which thou hidest for them that fear thee .\"Ps. 31:19 Seeing thou wilt remain invisible to th e world, I am about to create, and furthermore because of the goo dness hidden within thee, the gates of the temple w ill sink into the earth as it is written, ' Her gates are sunk into the ground ,'Lam. 2:9 and besides all this, thou with thy comr ade the letter Heth (bh) composed sin. Therefore, these letters will never enter in the names of the twelv e holy tribes.\" On hearing these words bh went not before the Holy One, but returned at once to its place."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"p. 45 Z then went up and urged its claim, saying: \" Thy children will through me keep the Sabbath , as it is written: ' Remember (Zecor) the Sabbath to keep it holy .\"Ex. 20:8 \"Thou, Oh Zain,\" replied the Holy One, \" art of too warlike a form, resembling as thou dust a spear. I cannot u se thee in the creation of the world.\" When Z heard this decision, like N it retired and g ave place to V, who said: \"I am a letter in thy hol y name.\" The eternal one answered and said: \"Remain contented, O h V that together with H you are in the great name. I shall not choose you by whom to create the world.\" D, accompanied by G, went before the divine presenc e. To them it was said, \"Let it suffice you, that s o long as you are conjoined and associated, there will always be the poorDeut 15:11 on the earth who will need succo r and help. Daleth (D)--poverty and Gimel (G)--help or the bene factor. Therefore both of you keep together, the on e helping the other.\" (In the Hebrew alphabet G and D are success ive letters). Then came B and said: \"Create the world by me, beca use I am the initial letter of beracha (blessing) a nd through me all will bless thee, both in the world above as in the world below.\" \"Truly, Oh B,\" said the Holy One, \"I will surely create the world by thee only.\" Hearing these words, A remained in its place and we nt not into the divine presence, who therefore excl aimed \"Aleph (A) Aleph! why comest thou not before me as all the other letters?\" Then replied A: \"Lord and sovereig n of the universe, it is because I have observed that (B exc epted) they have returned as they went, without suc cess. Why, therefore, should I come before thee, since thou ha st already given to B the great and precious gift w e all of us craved and desired. Moreover, it becometh not the m onarch of the universe to withdraw and take back hi s presents from one subject and give them to another.\" To thes e words the Holy One responded: \"Aleph, Aleph! Thou shalt be the first of all letters and my unity shall be symb olized only by thee. In all conceptions and ideas h uman or divine, in every act and deed begun, carried on and completed, in all of them shalt thou be the first, the beginn ing.\" Therefore did the holy one make the letters of the celestial alphabet, capitals, and those of the eart hly, small, each corresponding to one another. Therefore also the Bo ok of Genesis begins with two words whose initials are B, viz.: Braeshith, Bara (in the beginning created) followed by two others, whose initials p. 46 are A, viz., Alhim, ath (God, the substance of) to show that the letters of these alphabets celestial and earthly are one and the same by which every creature and thing in t he universe has been formed and produced. THE INITIATION OF RABBI HIYA. Bereshith, \"In the beginning,\" said Rabbi Ionda, \"w hat is the signification of this mystical word? It is hochma-- wisdom, that wisdom by which the world was formed a nd still subsists. Like a globe it includes the six directions of space, viz., north, south, east and west, high and low, from which emanate six streams of existence, a ll of which flow at last into the great ocean of primal life. A nother occult signification of Bereshith is this, B ara sith (he created six) and who was he? Though not mentioned, it was t he mysterious though ineffable, the great unknown.\" Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jose were walking together in the country and when they reached their destination , said Rabbi Hiya: \"This occult meaning of bereshith is undoubte dly correct, since we find in the Book of Genesis t hat the creation of all things occurred and took place in s ix days and not more. In an ancient occult work on Genesis we have found many references to this account. Thus, t he holy one at first formed a point in which was in cluded and concealed, as in a palace, the forms or prototypes of all created things. Now though the palace contai ns them, the key of it is the most essential thing which closes and opens it. This palace, the world, is the recept acle or casket in which are enclosed many wonderful and secret myster ies, it has fifty gateways, ten on each of its four sides, nine opening heavenward and one, of which nothing defini te is known about it, and it is therefore termed ' The Mysterious Gate .' There is also one kind of lock to all these gate s and one key alone opens and closes them and gives entrance into the palace and the treasures therein. Bereshit h, bara Alhim, these words are the palace, and Bere shith is the key that conceals or opens up their mysterious meanings . It opens and shuts, it reveals or obscures. Beres hith contains an opening word, shith, and a closing word, bara.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Truly this is so, and I have myse lf heard the master, Rabbi Simeon, say that this oc cult word bara closes but does not open, and thus explained it. p. 47 \"Ere the world became fixed and established, it was wrapped and enshrouded in darkness and chaos reign ed supreme 3b-4a and as long as it endured, the world was Tohu (without form and solidity). When this key opened the gates, it became adapted for the generation and pro duction of living beings. When was this? When Abrah am came, as it is written: ' These (Aleh) are the generations of the heavens and the earth, behibaram 'Gen. 2:4 (when they were created) which word is au anagram of beabraham (by Abraham). The creation was brought about by the tra nsposing of the letters of the concealing word, bara, into A bar, the sacred principle on which the world was fo unded and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"continues to subsist. Mi was the first aspect of th e mysterious unknown who, when bara was transposed into Abr, created Alh (these). To Abr he took and joined the letter H, forming Abrh, to Alh. He took and joined I, forming Alhi, then of the two component letters of Mi, he t ook and added M to each of them and thus were forme d Alhim and Abraham. Another explanation of the forming of these names is as follows: \"The holy one took Mi and joined it to Alh and this formed Alhim. He also took Mah, and joining it to Abr, formed Abraham. Now the name Mi (50) has reference to the fifty gates of Binah, the third sephira, and in it is also I, the first letter in the Shem Hamphorah or holy name IHV H, and Mah has also reference to the divine name, f or the H thereof is the second letter in it. So the two worl ds were formed, by I the world to come through H th e present world through Mi, the world on high, through Mah the worl d below. But until the name of Abraham was formed, there was no generation of living creatures and things, and t his explains what is written, Aleh produced the gen erations of the heaven and the earth bi-Abraham; that is, when the name of Abraham was formed, as it is written ' In that day the Lord God made the earth and the heavens .'\" Rabbi Hiya prostrated himself on the earth and kiss ing it, exclaimed: \"Oh, earth, earth! how hard and unfeeling art thou! In thee lies buried everything delighting the eyes. All the lights of learning and wisdom thou c ausest to disappear and vanish from the world. How unfeeling thou art. The great master and teacher, the one shi ning light of the world, by which it was enlightened, has returne d to the dust and now lies concealed in thee, even Rabbi Simeon thou hidest him and all things become subject to th ee at last. Overwhelmed with emotion, for a moment he became speechless. Again he cried, earth! earth! exult p. 48 thou not, for now I see the great masters of light are not delivered into thy hands, for Rabbi Simeon yet lives, and with eyes filled with tears of joy, Rabbi Hiya went on his way and Rabbi Jose was with him. For forty days he fasted that he might see Rabbi Simeon, but it was said to him: \"It is not possible for thee to behold him.\" T hen fasted he other forty days, at the end of which he saw as in a vision Rabbi Simeon, with Rabbi Eleazar his son, studying and meditating upon the words upon which Rabbi Jose had discoursed. They were surrounded by a multitude of listening and attentive students. 4a Anon he observed mighty angelic beings, who descended from on high, taking Rabbi Simeon, and Eleazar, his son, with them, wended the ir way again upwards to the celestial school, where , when they arrived, they all became arrayed with garments of d azzling splendor, whiter and more glittering than t he light of the sun. Then spake Rabbi Simeon, and said: \"Let Rabbi Hiya come up hither and behold how great joys the holy o ne hath prepared for the just and upright in the world to c ome. Blessed the lot of him who cometh hither with a pure heart and mind, blessed also are they who in the world ab ide steadfast and firm and unmoved as pillars of ri ght and truth.\" Rabbi Hiya then ascended and after making obeisance to Rabbi Eleazar and the masters who were standing to receive and welcome him, went and sat down at the f eet of Rabbi Simeon. A voice resounded and said: \"C lose thy eyes and bow thy head, so that thy mind may not be distracted or disturbed.\" He closed his eyes and th ere was, as it were, a great light shining afar off and another vo ice was heard saying: \"Ye heavenly beings, high and exalted ones, who unseen and invisible to mortal vision, visit th e world, attend ye! Teachers of the mysteries who i n your lonely hermitages are sleeping, awaken ye! attend, as also those who before coming hither, have turned darkne ss into light and made bitter to become sweet, waiting and longin g for the dawning of the day when the king should v isit his loved ones, in and by whom he shall be glorified an d hailed as the King of kings and Lord of lords. Su ch only have the right and privilege to be present here.\" Then Rabbi Hiya saw his fellow students standing ar ound the, masters and they wended their way to the celestial school. Some were ascending and others descending t hither, and at their head was the great winged ange l of the presence (Metatron), who was saying he had heard in the palace on high that the king, p. 49 visits everyday and does not forget his lone and lo ved ones who are struggling towards the higher life unnoticed and unregarded by the world. At that moment three hundr ed and ninety worlds trembled and shook as with an earthquake. Stars as of fire descended from on high and fell into the great sea, whose ruler then stoo d up and swore by him that lives forever, that he would dry up all the waters of creation if ever the world and its p owers should gather themselves against the children of light to destroy them. As he ceased speaking, Rabbi Hiya heard a voice fro m heaven exclaiming: \"Fall back! make room for the King Messiah coming to the school of Rabbi Simeon, whose students are all initiates and master teachers of the secret doctrine.\" Then came Messiah and visited all the ce lestial schools and confirmed the teachings and exp ositions of the mysteries given by their appointed instructors. As he entered the great assembly crowned with many crowns, all the great masters rose up and saluted. Turning to R abbi Simeon, the emanation of whose light reached u p to heaven, Messiah spake and said: \"Blessed art thou, Rabbi Si meon, for thy mystic teachings are of the highest w orth and valued and cherished by all. They only, along with those of Hesekiah, King of Judah, and Achiya, the S olonite, are"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"marked and sealed with the approval of the holy one . I have come hither because I know that the angel of the presence visits no other school save yours.\" As he ceased speaking, Rabbi Simeon raised his hand and repeated the vow of the angel of the great sea . Then spake Messiah words which made the heavens, the ocean and Great Leviathan tremble, fearing that the world wa s about to be destroyed and annihilated. Beholding Rabbi Hiya at the feet of Rabbi Simeon, \"Who!\" said he, \"who h as brought hither one clad in garments of the lower world?\" \"I t is Rabbi Hiya,\" replied Rabbi Simeon, \"a student skilled in the science of the mysteries.\" \"Let him then, together with his son, be enrolled as members of thy school. \" \"I pray thee,\" said Rabbi Simeon again, \"that time may be granted for due preparation.\" The request was granted and R abbi Hiya overwhelmed with feelings of joy, went forth exclai ming: \"Blessed is the lot of the just in heaven, bl essed also the lot of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, to whom4a-4b the wo rds of the scripture may be applied: ' I cause those that love me to be blest with substance, and I will fill their t reasures .'\"Prov. 8:21 p. 50 The following affecting and descriptive account of Rabbi Hiya's decease is not found in some of the ea rly editions of the Zohar and is probably an interpolation from an ancient Kabbalistic work no longer extant. Rabbi Hiya, perceiving the end of life approaching, exclaimed: \"Return, my soul to thy home on high! T hou spark divine of heavenly flame, quit thou this mortal fra me. Fearing, trembling, hoping the time has come fo r thee to mount up to the mansions of light and life. Sweet a ngelic voices are calling me. My strength is failin g, my eyes grow dim; I cease to breathe; the earth is disappea ring and heaven opens on my eyes. Me-thinks I hear the fluttering of angel wings. Ah! what do I see'? The tree of lif e radiating a perfume that fills the azure vault of heaven itself. I see descending the mystic heavenly dove. I recogniz e King Messiah, whom I saw in Rabbi Simeon's school . Oh! ye angelic beings, lend me your wings, that I may moun t on high to meet him. Oh, my soul! can this be dea th'? How vain the fear and dread of the transports of ecstat ic bliss and joys its presence brings! Oh, grave! w here is thy victory? Oh, death! where is thy sting?\" A moment, and his soul had taken its flight--the li fe of Rabbi Hiya had ended. THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER. Bereshith! Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \" I have put my words in thy month, and I have covere d thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay th e foundation of the earth .\"Is. 51:16 These words inculcate that man should study and acquaint himself with the myst eries of the secret doctrine by day and by night, a nd that the Holy One regards those whose delights are therein. Every new thought suggestive or explanatory of it i s crowned by him, and by it he forms a new heaven. It is said th at whenever a man gives expression to such a word i t ascends at once into the divine presence, who taketh and embra ceth it and adorneth it with seventy crowns, all en graveth with his holy name. This word of mystic wisdom then desc ends and visits the children of light, who are the life of the world. Then it flies through seventy thousand world s and stands before the Ancient of Days, with whose words, enfolding the deepest p. 51 mysteries, it then becomes united and together fly through eighteen worlds invisible to mortal eyesIs. 64:4 and known only to Alhim. Perfected and complete, it ret urns to the Ancient of Days and become to him a sub ject of delight as he takes and crowns it with three hundre d and seventy thousand crowns, when at length it is transformed into and becomes a new world. So, with every such l ike word, it becomes a new world of hidden mysterie s of heavenly wisdom, a new earth referred to in scriptu re. \" As the new heaven and the new earth which l make ab iding before me .\" Is. 66:22 Not which I have created, as in the pa st, but which I create in the present, by means of those holy words which preserve and renew the worlds, and this is the occult signification of these words. O bserve, it is said, not the heavens, but new heavens.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"What is the occult meaning of the words, 'In the shadow of mine hand have I hid t hee?'\"Is. 51:16 Rabbi Simeon replied: \"When the secret doctrine and its hidden mysteries was delivered to Moses on Mou nt Sinai myriads of angels endeavored, through jealousy, to consume him with their fiery breath. Then the Holy One covered him with his hand, so that they did him no hurt. Al so, with the word of which we have just described p roceeding from human lips, it also is covered and protected f rom the wrath and envy of angels, until it becomes a new heaven or a new earth; for then only become they uncovered and their meaning revealed. This is furthermore sh own by the words, ' Say unto Sion Ammi Atha ' ( thou art my people ). They should rather be rendered, 'Immi Atha' (tho u art with me), with me as an associate, just as my word was with me wh en I created the world, as it is written: ' By the word of the Lord the heavens were made .'Ps. 33:6 And so it is with words containing myste ries of the secret doctrine uttered by us. We become creators, and happy- am! blessed a re I hey who consecrate themselves to the study and teaching of this holy science and knowledge. If, however, yo u say that such a word may proceed from or be spoke n by one"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"who has no knowledge or understanding of sacred mys teries, observe that, if this should happen, then t he word spoken by one who is ignorant of the secret doctrin e is seized hold of by a demon called aishtahphucoth (froward lips), who casts it into the great abyss when it be comes a false heaven, and know as Tohu (vanity). When this heaven of falsehood is formed, forthwith it becomes united with another demon named esithzenonim (or lady of seductions), p. 52 who causeth the ruin and destruction of thousands a nd as long as this false heaven subsists and power and rule predominate.5a-5b Therefore is it written: ' Woe unto you who draw iniquity (avon) with cords of vanity and sin (hatah), as with a cart rope.'Isa 5:18 What is Hata h?

See to it, therefore, that ye let not a sin gle word escape your lips concerning divine mysteries without under standing or before consulting with a master that ye may not be originators of Hatah , and thus cause the destruction and ruin of many s ouls.\" With one accord exclaimed the students of Rabbi Sim eon: \"God keep and preserve us from this!\" Continuing his discourse, Rabbi Simeon said: \"Mark this also. It was by means of the secret doctrine t hat the Holy One created the world. Holy scripture affirms that it was with him and was his delight daily. He exami ned it attentively and minutely, and then uttered it, and thereby produced all his works in order to teach us to study occult science and sacred mysteries calmly and reverently, and thus avoid falling into error and causing many to stumble, to fall, to perish. It is written, \" Then did he see it and declare it. He prepared it; yea, searched it out .\"Job 28:27 in which verse are the words yaha (see), yesaphrah (de clared), kenah (prepared), hakar (searched), showin g what carefulness was exercised by the Holy One before cr eating the world. For ere doing so he formed the fo ur words corresponding to those we have just particularized, viz.: Bereshith, bara, Alhim, ath, implying a four fold examination of the secret doctrine ere he used it i n Creation.\" Rabbi Eleazar went one day to visit his uncle, Rabb i Jose,, and Rabbi Abba was with him. A porter foll owed behind them. I Said Rabbi Abba: \"As the time and opportunity are f avorable, let us discourse and search a little into the secret doctrine.\" Then spake Rabbi Eleazar, and said: \"It is written, 'Ye shall keep my sabbaths.'Lev. 19:30 Observe tha t in six days the Holy One created the world that each day was di stinguished by a special production. But on what da y appeared the production that was fruitful? On the fourth; fo r those of the three first days were unmanifested a nd hidden, viz.: fire, water, and earth. If you say that the earth w as clothed with vegetation on the third. it p. 53 was truly so. It was, however, really on the fourth day that the results became manifest and distincti ve in themselves, and thus it became the fourth pedestal of the heave nly throne. All the works of creation were finished certainly on the Sabbath,5b as it is written: ' And Alhim created on the seventh day ,' the Sabbath, which was the fourth day of the earth's fruitful production. But what meaneth 'Ye s hall keep my Sabbaths,' as though there were two or more sabbaths? The scripture, by this plural word, desig nates the eve of the Sabbath and the day of the Sab bath, distinct yet not separate.\" Then spake the porter who had followed them, and sa id: \"But what is the signification of the following words: 'Ye shall reverence my sanctuary.'\" Rabbi Eleazar replied: \"They refer to the holiness of the Sabbath.\" \"What do you mean by the holiness of the Sabbath?\" asked the stranger. \"It is the heavenly holiness which cometh down upon the earth on that day,\" replied Rabbi Eleazar. \"If so, then you make not the Sabbath holy, but a s omething which is from above.\" \"That truly is so,\" said Rabbi Abba, \"what Rabbi El eazar has said, for it is written: ' Call the Sabbath a delight, and the Holy of the Lord honorable .'Is. 58:13 Therefore there is a distinction betwee n the Sabbath day and the Holy of the Lord.\" \"What, then, meaneth the Holy of the Lord?\" asked t he stranger again. \"It is,\" replied Rabbi Abba, \"as has been just said , a heavenly holiness coming from above on that day .\" \"Then,\" answered the stranger, \"in that ease the he avenly holiness is glorious and hallowed, but not t he day of the Sabbath; and yet the scripture says, \"Glorify the S abbath day.\" \"Men,\" said Rabbi Eleazar to Rabbi Abba, \"let this man speak on, for he seems to be endowed with a wis dom and knowledge we do not possess.\" \"They turned toward the stranger and said: \"Give us your opinion on the subject.\" \"It is written,\" he said to them, \"' Keep my Sabbaths ,'Lev. 19:30 words which show plainly that there ar e two sabbaths--one heavenly and one earthly--yet are the y but one, both alike in their esoteric meaning.

I will yet adorn three with great honor and beauty.' Then made he pr oclamation, and said: 'Reverence my sanctuary.' That is to say, the Sabbath eve, which is also to be reverenced an d kept; for the name of the Holy One is found in the word. I will n ow inform you how my father explained this to me. ' Imagine,' said he, 'a square within a circle, symbolizing two divine forms, which, though distinct, are not sepa rate; for there is not division or separation in the divine essence. A n earthly resemblance to this divine union is that between Jacob and Joseph.5b-6a There is also a resemblance in the repetition of the word peace, in that verse of scr ipture, \" Peace to those that are far off and peace to those that a re near ,\"Is. 57:19 those that are far off referring to Jac ob and those that are near to Joseph, symbolical of the Sabbath and the Sabbath eve, distinguished by 'Keep the Sab bath'Deut. 5:12 Ex. 20:8 and 'remember the Sabbath day.' But the wo rds, 'Reverence my sanctuary,' designate a point in the middle of the square and circle which is the most sacred o f all--he who violates and breaks this commandment is punishable with death, as it is written, ' Whoso violates it shall be put to death ';Ex 31:14 that is, who enters into the circle and square to the middle point and profanes it. Therefo re is it said, ' Reverence ye ,' for that middle point is called Ani (Me). which is but another term or name of the Grea t Unknown, the Divine Being.\" After hearing these words from the unknown stranger , they embraced him, and said: \"Possessed of such knowledge of the secret doctrine , you must not follow behind, but go before us. Wha t is thy name?\" \"Ask me not,\" he replied. \"But let us go forward di scoursing on occult mysteries, each of us giving ut terance to words of hidden wisdom which shall lighten the way. \" Said they: \"How came you to follow us'?\" \"Yod,\" he replied, \"made war against two other lett ers, Caph and Samech (ch and S), in order that they might become attached to me. Koph was unwilling to be joi ned to one without whose help it could not subsist a single moment, and Samech was equally unwilling to become bound to Koph, and thus he unable to help those who stumble and fall. Then Yod, coming p. 55 to me, embraced me, caressed me, wept with me, and said: 'My child, what can I do for you? I aim about to ascend on high, and shall acquire amongst many good things secret letters. all capitals, and valuable. I will then come back to thee and help thee and give thee other letters, better and stronger than those who have forsaken an d left thee, even Ysh (blessing), who will he to thee treasures fille d with good things. Go, therefore, my child, and mo unt thy ass.' And this is why I am here.\" Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba were greatly pleased, and said: \"Go on before and we will follow after th ee.\" Replied the stranger: \"have I not told you it was t hrough the King's orders that I have come hither?\" They said: \"But you have not told us your name. Whe re de you dwell?\" \"My habitation is a fine and strong one, a high tow er, in which the Holy One and myself only reside. J ust now I am here riding on my ass.\" Then Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba pondered awhile a nd meditated on these sayings and the meaning of th em, which to them were as honey and manna. Then said th ey unto him: \"Who is thy father? If thou wilt tell us we will make obeisance unto thee.\" \"Wherefore should I?\" he answered. \"It is not usual with me to impart occult science to anyone. Howeve r, my father lives in the great sea, and was a great fish. He wa s great and strong and full of years, so that he sw allowed up all the other fishes of the sea and then sent them forth li ving and filled with all the good things of the wor ld. His power is such he can run through the sea in a moment, and he sent me forth as an arrow from the how of a skille d archer and concealed me in the place of which I have spoken; b ut he himself has returned, and remains hidden in t he sea.\" Rabbi Eleazar, after reflecting a moment, exclaimed : \"Thou art the son of the great mystic teacher Rab bi Hammenuna, the Aged, the great initiate in the secr et doctrine!\" Then they embraced him and went forward, saying: \"L et it please thee, Oh, master, tell us thy name?\" \"Then,\" said he, \"it is written, ' Benaiah, Son of Jehoida .'2 Sam 23:20 We have already expounded the signifi cation of these words. It will, however, be profitable to consider the deeply occult meaning of them, which h as reference to human life. To continue, 'Son of a living man'; tha t is, of the just one--the life of the p. 56 world. 'Who wrought many great works,' meaning Lord of all workers and of the heavenly hosts, all of w hom are marked and distinguished by the letters of the divi ne name, Yehoval Sabaoth, the greatest of all names .

'He killed two lions of Moab,' referr ing to the first and second temple of Jerusalem, which subsisted until t he heavenly light which enlightened them was withdr awn from them; then were they destroyed and the holy throne demolished. Thus it is written: ' I was in the captivity ';Ezek. 1:1 that is to say, this divine glory or essence called Ani (I) was in captivity. Why does the scripture s till proceed, saying: 'By the River Chebar?' Because Chebar is th e mysterious river of the heavenly light which flow eth forth, but became dried up and ceased to flow when I was in ca ptivity, and this is the meaning of the words, ' The river decayeth and drieth up ,'Job 14:11 referring to the two temples of Jerusal em. With respect to the words, 'He killed two lions of Moab,' this latter word should be rend ered Meab--of the father in heaven, having the same occult meaning. Again it is said of Benaiah, ' He went down and slew a lion in the midst of the pi t in time of snow .' In former times, when the river of divine radiance and glory was flowing, the children of Israel flourish ed and lived in peace and offered up daily sacrifices for their sin s, when a celestial being, with the emblematic form of a lion, was seen by them descending on the altar, consuming and devouring the offerings with the avidity of a hung ry man, during which the demons of evil, like dogs, fled aw ay and hid themselves. But, on account of the sins of the people, the Most High came down and killed the lion, if it may be so expressed. ' He killed it in a pit ,' meaning in presence of the dog-like demons, living in dark subterranean pl aces, that they might see they could seize and devo ur now the sacrifices, as they were of no worth in his sight. Now, the name of the lion was Ouriel , because lion-like in form, and the name of p. 57 the demons was Baladan , or not human but dog-like. 'In the time of snow'; that is, when the children of Israel sinned and were consumed by divine justice. Such also is t he significance of the words, ' She feareth not for her house of snow .'Prov. 31:21 Why? Because arrayed with purple, and thus able to resist the fiercest flame. To proceed further, 'And he killed an Egyptian, a goodly man,' teaching that whenever Israel sins it loses the blessing an d light of the divine presence which it once enjoyed. ' And he killed the Egyptian ,' referring to the light which illuminated Israel, viz.: Moses, who was called an Egyptian by the daug hters of Jethro, when they said to him: ' An Egyptian hath helped us .'Ex. 2:19 In Egypt he was born and reared, and the re he became initiated in the secret doctrine. 'A g oodly man,' for he saw the Lord clearlyNum. 12:8 and not in dark speeches. He was a divine man, a man of God ,Deut. 33:1 a recipient of divine science as no other man had ever enjoyed before. ' And in hand of the Egyptian was a spear .' This was the sceptre or rod of God that was hand ed to Moses, as mentioned by scripture: ' And the rod of the Alhim was in my hand ,'Ex. 17:9 the rod which was made when the sun rose for the first time, and on it was engraved the Shem Hamphorash, or most holy divine name. By i t he smote the rock, as it is written: ' And he struck the rock with his rod twice .'Num. 20:11 Then said the Holy One: 'Moses, my rod was not given to thee to be used thus. I swear, by thy life, from this moment thou shalt not retain it.' Therefore we read: ' He descended with the rod ,' which proved a great affliction for Israel, for then the rod was taken away. ' And he wrested the spear from out of the hand of the Egyptian ,' meaning the rod, and it was never seen again. Th en, furthermore, he read: 'He killed him with his spear for the sin committed by a wrong use of the r od. Moses died and was not allowed to enter into th e promised land, and that light was taken from Israel. The scr ipture further relates that he, Benaiah, ' Was more honorable than the thirty, but he was not one of the three .'2 Sam. 23:23 'More honorable than the thirty, ref erring to the thirty years he was separated from the heavenly powers on high, and who, at the end of life, took him to themselves again. ' But he became not one of the three , viz.: the Divine, under three hypostases or forms , and who gave him the desire of his heart. ' Nevertheless, David set him over his guard '; that is, David, being attached to him, retained his services, so that they might not be separated from one another, in the same p. 58 way that the moon is attached to the sun, to which it addresses its song of praise as the center and s ource of its light.\" Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba knelt and prostrated t hemselves before the stranger, and then--but where was he? He had suddenly disappeared. They looked around amazed , but he was not to be seen. They sat down and pond ered, bewildered and speechless. At length Rabbi Abba spa ke, and said: \"True is it that whenever students of esoteric trut hs travel together, discoursing amongst themselves on the mysteries of the secret doctrine, then are they visited by sp iritual masters and teachers from on high.

Again they tried, with no better suc cess. Filled with a feeling of trepidation, they fled away and l eft their asses behind, and to this day that place is known and called Assfield . RABBI ELEAZAR spake and said: \"How great is thy goo dness which thou hast laid up for them that fear Th ee\" (Ps. xxxi. 19). How exceedingly great the celestial happ iness which the Holy One has prepared for those who are pure in heart and mind and delight in the study of the divi ne law, when they ascend into the higher and divine r life. The scripture does not only say thy goodness, but the g reat abundance of thy goodness. What do these words comprehend? It will be one of the great enjoyments of those who attain to the higher life, to live in the presence of the Eternal One71 who is known to them as \"Abundant Goodness\" and who in scripture is referred to as \" the great good to the house of Israel, or children of light.\" Again, \"How great is thy goodness,\" words wherein is contained the mystery of Hochma (Wisdom) which includes all m ysteries and therefore is designated or called Mah (how.) \"Thy goodness\" is the light created on the first da y. \"Which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee \" signifies the garden of Eden of which it is written: \"The place, O Lord, which thou hast made for them to dwell in\" (Ex. xv. 17). \"Before the sons of Men,\" viz., the soul:; of the j ust who, on p. 60 their ascension into Paradise, became clothed with bright ethereal raiment and in their forms resemble those they bore on the earth plane. After abiding there a shor t space of time, they mount up to the celestial col lege in the higher Eden, where, after bathing in perfumed rivers, they come forth at times, appearing to man, on whose be half they perform miracles like the angels from on high and s imilar to what we have ourselves just experienced. We have seen the light of the sacred lamp, but alas! that we hav e not learned and acquired more of the secret doctr ine of Wisdom. Then spake Rabbi Abba. It is written: \"And Manoah s aid to his wife, 'We shall surely die for we have s een God'\" (Judges xiii. 22). Although Manoah knew not who had spoken to him, 7a-7b yet he imagined it was the di vine Being of whom it is affirmed \"No man can see my face and live.\" We ourselves have been blessed with the cele stial light that has been with us on our way, and whom the Holy One has sent to us in order to make known and reve al to us secret wisdom. Happy are we! Then went they on their way and arrived at a hillsi de as the sun was about to set. The leaves of the t rees in a neighboring grove stirred by a gentle breeze began in sweet cadences to hymn their praises to the Crea tor and heard by the travellers wending their way, a voice cried: \"Children of the great Divine who go down and ming le with mortals on the earth plane, and who reflect the lig ht of your learning in the celestial college, assem ble and gather yourselves together in your usual places for instru ction in the secret doctrine.\" Then another voice e xclaimed: \"Ye great and honored teachers, behold, the Master sits on his throne!\" Then another voice, in great and m ighty tones, cried aloud: \"The voice of the Lord breaketh the ce dars\" (Ps. xxix. 5). Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba a t once prostrated themselves with their faces on the earth and trembled greatly. At last, rising, they fled h astily away and stayed not to listen longer, but proceeded on their way. On arriving at the house of Rabbi Jose, son of Rabb i Simeon, son of Leconga, they beheld Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai there, and were exceeding glad. Said Rabbi Simeon: I know your journey has been a wonderful and marvel lous one. We were sleeping when you went forth and we saw wit h you Benaiah the son of Jehoida and who had brough t two crowns from the Aged One wherewith to bedeck you. T ruly the Holy One was with you. Furthermore, if I h ad not seen this in a vision, I should have p. 61 divined from your looks what has happened unto you. Said7b Rabbi Abba: What thou sagest is true, and t he words of a sage are of more worth than those of a prophet . Rabbi Eleazar then recounted to his father all th at had happened to them. Rabbi Simeon trembled and said: \"Oh, Lord, I have heard thy speech and was afraid\" (Habac. ii i. 1). These words were uttered by the prophet Habacuc. After dy ing he was resuscitated and brought back to life by Elisha, the prophet and seer. Wherefore was he called Habacuc? Because of the words of Elisha to his mother: \"Abou t this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt e mbrace a son\" (II. Kings iv. 16). In Hebrew the wor d embrace is expressed by the word habac . The prophet Habacuc was the son of the Shunamite woman and was so named because he was once embraced by his mother and agai n by Elisha as the scripture relates. \"And he put h is mouth upon his mouth\" (II. Kings iv. 34). In an ancient b ook written by King Solomon, I have read that the s eventy-two sacred divine names of the Holy One imprinted on th e body of every mortal born into the world, had fad ed and become obliterated from the form of the Shumanite's son when he died. After Elisha the prophet had emb raced him, these names containing two hundred and sixty letter s reappeared, hence his name Habacuc, the numerical value of the letters composing it, being equal to 260. This is why Habacuc said: \"I have heard thy speech and w as afraid,\"Hab. 3:2 that is, what I must experience or pass through in the world and was afraid. Oh, Lord ! grant that thy work which time hast performed through me in my two lives may endure."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Pausing a moment, Rabbi Simeon exclaimed: After wha t I have heard from you I also am afraid before the Holy One. Then raising his hands on high he cried: How g reat is Hammenuna the aged, the renowned teacher of the secret doctrine! Blessed and happy are ye who have seen hi m face, to face, a favor I have never enjoyed. Pros trating himself upon the earth, Rabbi Simeon beheld in a vi sion Rabbi Hammenuna the aged, on his course and ha stening to light up the temple of King Messiah. Observing Rabb i Simeon, he cried: \"Thou shalt be associated and t ake thy place with the great teachers of the secret doctrin e who ever stands in the presence of the Holy One.\" From that day Rabbi Simeon called Rabbi Eleazar his son and Rabbi Abba by the name of Peniel as we read of Jacob: \"He called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen Alhim face to face\" (Gen. xxxii. 30). EXPOSITION OF BIBLE MYSTERIES. \"In the beginning,\"7b-8a Rabbi Hiya spake and said: \"The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah, a good understanding I have all they that do his commandme nts, his praise endureth forever\" (Ps. cxi. 10). Th e beginning of wisdom has reference to the great object of wisdom, viz., to raise and elevate us into the higher and diviner life, as it is said: \"Open to me the gates of righteousness\" (P s. cxviii. 19). This is the gate or way of the Lord through which everyone must pass in order to attain lento this li fe and live in the presence of the heavenly king. E re this, however, there are several other gates on the upward course which must be passed through, each with their bolts and bars that have to be unloosed, and the last of which is that called \"the fear of the Lord.\" It is the one only g ate of access. There are in scripture two beginnings (bereshith) m entioned, and are united into one, viz., \"the fear of the Lord\" and \"the beginning of Wisdom,\" both one and the same, a nd never found disjoined from each other. As it is written: \"That men may know that thy name is Jehovah only.\" (Ps. lxxxiii. 18). Why is the first gate called the fear of the Lord? Because it is a tree of good or evil. When a man lives uprightly, it is a tree of good to him; i f unjustly, a tree of evil. It is the gate or portal through which all blessing, spiritual or temporal, comes. The words: \"A good understanding,\" refer to those gates which, as afor esaid, are one and the same. Said Rabbi Jose: \"A good understanding\"; it is the tree of life without admixture or alloy of evil. \"T hat do his commandments\" are they who are true and faithful st udents of esoteric science. \"His praise endureth fo rever\" signifies that the throne of God or, in other words , the action of the good law, pervades the universe and endures throughout all ages. Rabbi Simeon was sitting engaged in meditation and study of the secret doctrine during the night when the celestial bride becomes united to her bridegroom, for then, i t is enjoined upon all the members of her retinue t hey should especially be present to accompany her to the nupti al dais and rejoice with her. On the eve of the hea venly union they must devote themselves to the study of the Pen tateuch, the prophetical hooks, and the other parts of scripture, to the explanation of verses, and their occult meaning in which the heavenly spouse takes great delight. These students, with their acquired knowledge resulting from their studies, are \"the marriage guests.\" When she ascend eth p. 63 and seateth herself on the nuptial dais, the Holy O ne salutes her and blesses her attendants and prese nts them with crowns and garlands. Happy and blessed is their lot ! Rabbi Simeon, together with his students, spent t he night in study and acquiring deeper knowledge of esoteric sc ience. Then said Rabbi Simeon: Blessed are ye! inas much as having spent this eve in meditation and study, your names will be enrolled and written in the celestia l book, and the Holy One will endow you with faculties and powers m ore enlarged and receptive for the comprehension an d understanding of divine mysteries. Rabbi Simeon again spake and said: \"The heavens dec lare the glory of God.\" (Ps. xix. 2). These words h ave already been explained, but they possess a deeper mystical meaning. At the time that the heavenly spouse is ad orned in order to ascend the nuptial dais surrounded with the mast ers or teachers who have rejoiced with her througho ut the night, beholding her husband, then is it \"the heavens decl are the glory of God,\" the heavens meaning the brid egroom who enters the nuptial chamber. The word \"declare\" (mes apherim) signifies sending forth glittering rays fr om one end of the wood to the other like a brilliant sapphire. \"T he glory of God\" is the glory of the bridegroom who is called El (God) as it is written: \"El judgeth the righteous, El is angry with the wicked every day.\" (Ps. vii. 1 2). During the whole of the year up to the eve of the celestial un ion, He is called El, but when the marriage day is consummated, he takes the name of Kobad (glory). These two names ar e a source of reciprocal light, power and joy to ea ch other. \"And the firmament showeth his handiwork.\"Ps. 19:1 His handiwork are the true and faithful followers o f the holy law of whom it is said: \"Let the beauty of the Lord , our God, lie upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of [our hands establish thou it\" (Ps. xc. 17), signifying or referring to the w ork of circumcision, which is a sign marked on the human b ody. Rabbi Hammenuna, the aged, has said: \"Suffer n ot thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin\" (Eccles. v. 5). Ne ver allow thy lips to give expression to evil words and thus sin against thy flesh which has been sanctified with th e seal of the holy covenant, for by so doing thou i ncurrest the danger of being cast into the hell of evil and wron g-doing (Gehenna), the ruler of which is called Duma and is"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"always attended with destroying angels, observing t hose who keep the covenant over whom they have then no power to injure or afflict. It is further written: \"Neither say p. 64 thou before the angel, that it was an error; that i s, speak nothing that will cause the angel Duma to prevail against and overcome thee. \"The firmament showeth his handi work.\" These are the companions of the heavenly spo use, whose names are marked and inscribed in the firmame nt. What firmament?8b-9a The visible heaven in whic h are the sun and moon, stars and constellations, and is the true Book of God. In it are found and written t he names of all who have kept themselves pure and undefiled. \"Day unto day uttereth speech.\"Ps. 19:2 This refers to the great holy day of the King who applauds his companions and commends the words of learning and wisdom utter ed by each of them. \"Night unto night showeth knowl edge.\" That is, each night communicates to the following o ne the mystery of the esoteric knowledge which enli ghtens all intelligences. \"There is no speech nor language whe re their voice is not heard,\" meaning they discours e not of worldly matters and vanities in presence of the Kin g, who taketh no delight in such. \"Their line is go ne out through all the earth\" refers to the dimensional archetypes according to which the heavens and the earth were measured and formed. If the question be asked who resides in the m? Scripture declares: \"In them hath he set a taber nacle for the sun,\" that is, the Holy One has fixed his mansion o r tabernacle in the heavens wherein he is adorned a nd is then as a bridegroomPs. 19:5 coming out of his chamber rejoic ing to run on his course, which when finished, he m ounteth on high and runneth another course elsewhere. \"His goi ng forth is from the end of the heaven and his circ uit unto the ends of it.\"Ps. 19:6 that is, he descendeth from th e higher to the lower world, which is expressed by the word outhqonphatha in which is included the idea of rotundity. For th is reason the duration of a year is termed, thqouphatha-shana, for during that period the earth has travelled round the sun, and been the recipien t of the whole of its rays of light and heat. \"And there is nothin g hid from the heat thereof.\" Every created thing, whether visible or not, is affected by the warming rays of the sun, wh ich occultly represents the universality of the sec ret doctrine operating everywhere and is described as \"the law o f the Lord is perfect.\" From the beginning of this Psalm (19th) the tetragr ammaton or holy name I. H. V. H. is found six times , showing the mystery contained in the word Brashith (in the beginning), which has six letters. Bra-shi th. (He created six) and these six letters correspond to the six first words of scripture which express p. 65 the work of creation. Bra, Alhim, eth, hassamayim, veath, aaretzs (Alhim created the substance of the heaven and the earth)9a or thus: Alhim created the substance o f fire, water and earth. At this moment Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba entered the assembly. On beholding them, Rabin Simeon excl aimed: Truly is the presence of the Schekinah with you and therefore I have called you Peniel, for ye have se en the Schekinah face to face, and now that I have explain ed the esoteric meaning of Benaiah, Son of Jehoida, I will explain to you the mystical meaning of yet another biblical verse: \"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature five cubits high\" (I. Chron. xii. 23). The word Egy ptian refers to Moses, of whom we said that he was very \"great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servant s and the people of the land\" (Ex. xi. 3), the myst ical meaning of which is that he was distinguished more by his inte llectual endowments and gifts than by his stature, similar to Adam, the first man, of whom it is metaphorically s aid that his stature was of the number of cubits se parating the east from the west of the world. So when it is said of Moses that he was five cubits in height, it mea ns that he was an adept practised in the five virtues leading to spir itual perfection, viz., love to God, chastity, char ity, humility and perseverance in meditation and study of the secret doctrine. \"And in the hand of the Egyptian was a sp ear like a weaver's beam,\" meaning the rod of God on which was engraved the holy name of forty-two letters, as wa s the shuttle of Bezaleel since we read: \"He hath filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom, in understand ing, in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship, and to devise curious works, in gold, silver and brass--al l manner of work of the engraver, of the cunning workman, and o f the embroiderer\" (Ex. xxxv. 31-35). \"Happy was th e lot of Moses!\" Come, therefore, dear friends; come and let us meditate and evolve new thoughts and ideas from out of the secret doctrine, for whoever on this night doeth th us shall be preserved from evil, and live in peace hereafter, \"for the angel of the Lord campeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them. Oh, taste and see th at the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusteth in him\" (Ps. xxxiv. 8-9). Again, on another occasion, Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"Bereshith bara Alhim\" (In the beginning crea ted God). These words require great thought and consideration , for everyone that says there is another God is cu t off from the world, as it is written: p. 66 [paragraph continues] \"Thus shall he say unto them, the gods that have n ot made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these he avens\" (Jer. x. 11), for there is other God beside the Holy One."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This verse is in the Chaldee tongue excepting the l ast word, Aleh (these) which is in Hebrew.

Now the word earth which in Hebrew is arqa, in the Chaldee is arca; why so? Because it is one of the s even lower worlds where reside the descendants of Cain. After his expulsion from the earth, he went thither and b egat children. This arqa was partly lighted and partly enshrouded in darkness and governed by two chiefs who were con stantly warring against each other. On the arrival of Cain, however, they entered into an alliance of friendsh ip for they perceived that it was to him they owed their existe nce. They became one body with two heads, the name of the one was Aphira , and Qastimon , the name of the other; this ruled over the dark, that over the light parts of Arqa. Before becoming joined together, they were like angels wit h six wings, Aphira having the form of an ox, Qasti mon that of an eagle. On their union, they took on them the hum an form and begat offspring like unto themselves. W hen they found themselves in darkness, they became changed i nto the form of a serpent with two heads, and crawl ing as a serpent they plunged into the great sea, the abode of demons, where they found the decadent angels Aza r and Azael and expelled them from their lurking places. These then fled and hid themselves in dark mountains thin king that the Holy One was about to execute vengeance open them f or their evil doings and conduct. After this, the t wo chiefs Aphira and Qastimon swam through the great sea and went to visit Naamah, the mother of the demons, and the first deceiver and seducer of holy angels, who after thei r fall took different human forms and in their turn became corruptors of mankind. After roaming through the wo rld they returned to Arqa, and now their great obje ct is to corrupt the descendants of Cain and lead them into sin. Respecting this Arqa, the heaven with its vari ous constellations and stars is altogether different p. 67 from our visible heavens at night. The seasons for sowing and9b-10a reaping are not the same as ours i n their sequence and regularity, being separated by a consi derable number of years; these two chiefs of Arqa a re they to whom the Scripture refers, who posing as gods shall become exterminated from our Thebel or earth on wh ich they shall not exercise any dominion, nor afflict the ch ildren of man during the night, but as saith the Sc ripture: \"They shall be destroyed by Aleh, by whom the heavens and the earth have been created\". This is why Aleh in this verse is written in Hebrew, designating the holy name untran slatable into the Chaldee language. Then said Rabbi Eleazar to his father: What meaneth the words: \"Who would not fear thee, Oh King of na tions?\" (Jer. x,, 7). Who is this King of Nations or Gentil es? Said Rabbi Simeon: \"This verse, my son, has been in terpreted in various ways, but all alike erroneous, as is proved by the remaining portion of tine verse, \"among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdo ms, there is none like unto thee,\" which closes the mouth of the ungodly who imagine that the Holy One knoweth not and is not acquainted with the thoughts of their hearts. We wi ll now refute their error. A Gentile philosopher came to me one day, saying: Y ou say that your God rules in the heavens on high a nd that all the angelic hosts cannot approach him or form a con ception of his being. The words of this verse add n o dignity to his glory. What glory and eminence can be ascribed to a deity who cannot be found and located amongst mankind. Furthermore, you declare: \"And there arose not a pr ophet since in Israel like unto Moses\" (Deuter. xxx iv. 10), from which it may be inferred that though no such prophe t as he rose in Israel, yet it does not apply to th e Gentiles, amongst whom I venture to maintain there have appea red many as great and equal to him. From these word s of Jeremiah I conclude therefore that only amongst the wise men of the Gentiles there is none like unto G od, but that in Israel there have been many like unto him; conseque ntly, he could not be from this similarity their su perior or master. Think well over my words and you will confe ss that I have reasoned logically and correctly. My reply to him was thus: 'It is true what thou say est, that in Israel there have been some sages like unto God. Who raiseth the dead to life again? Is it not God only? Yet both Elijah and Elisha brought the dead to lif e again. Who maketh the rain p. 68 descend, but God only? Yet by his prayer Elijah cau sed it to cease and descend. Who is it but the Holy One that made the heavens and the earth? Yet Abraham came, a nd by him they were established. Who rules the cour se of the sun? Is it not the Holy One? Yet Joshua commanded i t to stand still as it is written: \"And the sun sto od still\" (Josh. x., 13). The Holy One gave decrees, so also did Mos es, and they were established and conformed. Again the Holy One decreed punishments, but the just men of Israel caused them to cease or be turned aside, as it is said: \"The righteous man ruleth in the fear of God\" (II. Sam. xxiii., 3). Moreover, he commanded the just to walk in his way and to become like him. On hearing these words the philosopher turned away and went to the village of Shehalim, where he became known as the Little Joshua. There h e applied himself to the study of the secret doctri ne and eventually became one of the sages and chief men in that place. 10a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Let us now return to the exposition of the words: \" All the nations before him are as nothing.\"Isa. 40: 17 What do they mean? As also: \"Who would not fear thee, Oh King of the Gentiles.\" What is their signification? Is God then the King of the Gentiles and not of Israel? Yea, the Ho ly One everywhere wishes to be glorified and worshi pped by Israel and his name to be attached to Israel only, as it is written: \"The God of Israel, the God of th e Hebrews\" (Ex. v., 3). \"The King of Israel\" (Is. xliv., 6). But th e other nations of the world say: \"We have other pr otectors in heaven. Your king ruleth over you and our king ruleth over us. The Scriptures say: \"Who would not fear thee, O h King of the Gentiles?\" Now in heaven there are four great c osmokratores or rulers who derive their power and a uthority over the nations from the divine ruler and are unable to do anything except by his will and command. By the words: \"Wise men of the nations,\" is meant the celestial r ulers of the Gentiles, from whom these receive all their wisdom. Also the words: \"Amongst all their kingdoms,\" have reference to the dominions of these rulers with the ir attendant hosts, who control the affairs of the world as exec utors of the divine will. \"There is none like unto thee, Oh Lord, the holy and hidden one, who hath made the heavens and the earth.\" Of this Holy One we learn: \"In the begi nning God created the heavens and the earth,\" but to the nati ons and their dominions may be applied: \"And the ea rth was without form and void.\" Children! exclaimed Rabbi Simeon, let each of you p repare p. 69 or procure a jewel for the heavenly bride; and thou , Eleazar, my son, be ready when the bridegroom com eth, to offer thy present to-morrow, when he ascendeth the dais w ith hymns and praises of his retinue. Then Rabbi Eleazar read aloud: \"Who is this that co meth out of the wilderness?\" (Cant. III., 6). The t wo words \"who\" and \"this\" refer to two holy beings intimatel y associated and joined together by a tie which is termed olah (sacrifice). Though the literal meaning of this wor d is to ascend or come up, yet it occultly refers t o the \"Holy of Holies.\" Again \"who\" (Mi) is united to \"this\" (Zoth ) in order that it, the Holy of Holies, may come fr om the wilderness. \"Out of the wilderness\" means mysticall y from or out of the word, and we are taught: \"Thy word is comely\" (Cant. IV., 3). Also by way of tradition ha s been imparted to us the signification of the word s: \"Who shall deliver us out of the hand of this mighty God?\" Thi s is the God that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness\" (I. Sam., iv., 8). Why in the wildernes s, when we read it was in their own land of Egypt? Now the term bemidhar (in the wilderness) in its real meaning is \"by the Word,\" and everything that was done unto t hem was done by the Word of the Lord. And this is true generally . When man rises in the morning he should utter or pr onounce a blessing as soon as he opens his eyes, as did the holy men of olden time. They used to place near themselv es a vessel of water. When waking they washed their hands and then commenced the study of the secret doctrine. At the time of cock crow, whether it be at midnight o r break of day, the Holy One is found in the Garden of Eden, d uring which the defiled and impure are forbidden to pray or bless. When a man sleeps and his soul quits his bod y, an impure spirit comes and attaches itself to it and pollutes it. This is why it is forbidden to bless God before fir st washing the hands and engaging in the study of o ccult science. This applies also during the day when a man is awak e; for then the impure spirit is unable to defile h im except he is in some improper place. Even then it is unlawful wh en leaving it to bless God or recite a single verse of scripture without first washing his hands, though be may not have touched any impure thing. Woe to those who neg lect and regard not this rite! They know nothing of the glor y of their Lord; nothing of the law or principle up on which the world is founded. In every impure place there is an impure spirit whose delight is to dwell there and attach itself to man. p. 70 Then spake Rabbi Simeon and said: Whoever gives not to10b-11a God a part of his works or substance is guilty of avarice. Satan hates him, becomes his accuser and t akes him out of the world. Great and terrible are t he afflictions he has to endure! We give to God when we give to th e poor as far as we are able, in the time of their need and necessity. If in times of our rejoicing and feastin g the Holy One observes them ignored and forgotten and uncared for he grieves over and sympathizes with them and a scends on high, thinking to destroy the world. Then the souls of just men made righteous gather before him, saying: \"Lord of the universe! thy name is called gracious and merciful. Have pity upon thy erring, forgetful children.\" And the Holy One replies: \"Is it not upon mercy that I have founded the world as it is written: \"The world is builded u p on mercy\" (Ps. lxxxix., 2). Then spake the angels : \"Ruler of the universe! behold such a man eats and drinks and is able to succor the poor, yet refrains his hand.\" Th en goeth forth the accuser, after obtaining permission, and hurrie s him out of existence. Who in the world was so gre at as Abraham, who did good and was kind to all creatures ? Yet we learn from tradition that when Isaac, his son, was weaned,Gen. 21:8 he made a great feast and invited thereto all the great men of the place to be presen t. At the festive gathering it is said that an accusing angel was the re in the form of a poor unknown beggar, but no one recognized or took any notice of him. Abraham busied himself in a ttending to and waiting upon his royal and noble gu ests, whilst Sarah suckled the infants of all those who did not believe that she had given birth to a child and sai d that Isaac was"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"some foundling who had been picked up on the roadsi de and brought to Sarah. When, therefore, they brou ght their own infants Sarah suckled all of them in their pres ence as the scripture states: \"Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck.\"Gen 21: 7 The accusing angel happened to be entering the ho use when Sarah was uttering the words: \"God has made me a su bject of laughter.\" Forthwith he presented himself before the Holy One and said: \"Lord of the universe, Thou call est Abraham thy friend. He has made a great feast, but has not remembered the poor and has not even offered a sacr ifice of a single turtle dove. Sarah also says Thou hast caused her to become a subject of derisive laughter and je ers.\"Gen. 21:6 Then replied the Holy One: \"Who is t here amongst men, kinder and more charitable than Abraham?\" The accuser, however, was dissatisfied until p. 71 he learned that the feast would be followed by sorr ow and trouble to Abraham, which came to pass when God commanded Abraham to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice, and Sarah died through anguish of heart when she l earned what God had commanded with respect to her son. All these misfortunes arose through neglect of the poo r.\" On another occasion Rabbi Simeon spake and said: it is written: \"And Hezekiah turned his face toward t he wall and prayed unto the Lord\" (Is. xxxviii., 2). Observe ho w great the power and influence of a student of the secret doctrine. He is superior to all others, for he fear s nothing, being in close touch with the tree of li fe, from which he receives counsel and instruction all his days. It t eaches is in the way of truth and how to avoid evil that may assail us, and also how to direct our ways and walk before the Lord. Therefore, it is necessary we should stu dy the secret doctrine day and night and observe its teachings an d doctrines. By night, when reclining on our beds w e ought to submit ourselves to the kingdom of heaven and make it our chief object to commend ourselves to the car e and guardianship of the Almighty. Then become we freed from all evil influences and demoniacal powers have no sway over us. In the morning the student of esoteric sci ence rises and gives thanks to his Lord and wends h is way to the temple and there pours forth his soul in prayer and adoration. Afterwards he should take counsel from the holy patriarchs, as it is written: \"I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple\" (Ps. v. 7). We are taught f rom tradition never to enter the house of prayer be fore being instructed by the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Ja cob, who will inspire us with suitable prayers to b e addressed to the Holy One, for the words: \"In the multitude of t hy mercy\"11a designate Abraham; \"I will worship in or toward thy holy temple,\" refer to Isaac; and \"in thy fear, \" to Jacob. Then we render acceptable worship and o f us it will he said: \"Israel, thou art my servant in whom I will b e glorified\" (Is. xlix., 3). Rabbi Pinchus used frequently to go and visit Rabbi Rechumi, whose dwelling was on the borders of the Sea of Genessareth. Rabbi Rechumi was very aged and had be come blind. He spake and said to Rabbi Pinchus: I h ave heard that the son of Jochai, my fellow student in esoteric science, possesses a most precious stone, a pearl I have greatly desired to behold. It radiates rays of ligh t like those of the sun and lightens up p. 72 the world and will continue to do so until the Anci ent of Days sits upon his throne. Thou art his gran dson, therefore happy is thy lot. Go thou my son and search for thi s glittering and lustrous pearl, for now is the mos t propitious time for finding it. Rabbi Pinchus with two others, went forth and embar ked on a vessel. Observing two birds flying overhea d, he cried aloud: Birds! birds! flying over the waters, have y ou seen the dwelling place of the son of Jochai?11a -1b After a few moments again he cried: Birds! Birds! come and tell me. Then flew they away, but after a time returned and in the beak of one of them was a slip of paper on which wa s written: \"The son of Jochai has quitted and left the cave in which he dwells with Rabbi Eleazar his son.\" Then h e went and found Rabbi Simeon suffering from bodily sores. To his expressions of sorrow, finding him so ill an d afflicted, Rabbi Simeon replied: I am glad, Rabbi Pinchus, thou hast found me thus. If it had been otherwise I shou ld not be what I am. Suffering makes us wiser and b etter. p. 73 THEN began Rabbi Simeon to discourse on the secret doctrine. \"In the beginning created God\" (Gen. i. 1 ). These words are included in the first commandment which i s known as \"the fear of the Lord,\" the first step i n the acquiring of true wisdom and knowledge. It is also called the beginning because it is the true gate through whic h we enter into the higher mysteries of the divine life. and is the foundation upon which the world exists. There are three kinds of fear, two of which are of no avail in the search af ter truth, and have no reference except to bodily o r physical enjoyment and delight, and the preservation of weal th, and therefore are altogether unmeritorious. Tru e fear is that affection which arises from a feeling of reverence toward the Holy One as being all powerful, the root less root of all life and existence and in whose eyes the illimitabl e universe with all its inhabitants are as nothing. This the fear which when exercised tends to bring nearer the time when the divine will shall universally prevail thr oughout the world. In uttering these words Rabbi Simeon was affected t o tears and said: Woe unto me whether I speak or ke ep silence! For if I speak, sinners will know how to worship an d serve the Lord, and refraining therefrom will thu s add to their"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"guilt, and if I keep silent then I keep back knowle dge that ought to be imparted to you. The man whose fear springs from a dread of affliction that may assail him, fal ls under the power and influence of evil that becom es his tormentor. The only right fear is that described by p. 74 scripture, as \"The beginning of wisdom and knowledg e.\"11b-12a Whoever begins the divine life with it, begins well and observes all the other precepts which are inclu ded in it. On the contrary, whoever exercises it no t breaks and violates them, and to him may be applied the words of scripture: \"And the earth was without form and v oid, and darkness was upon the face of the great deep, and t he spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Gen. i. 2). In this verse are designated the four kinds of punishm ents inflicted upon the ungodly: Tohu (without form ), the punishment of strangulation referred to by the prop het Isaiah (Ch. xxxiv. 11) as the cord of Tohu. Boh u (void), which ejected great stones by which criminals are s toned, is the second kind of punishment. The third is darkness (choshek) or death by fire, as it is written: \"When ye heard his voice out of the midst of the darknes s, for the mountain did burn with fire\" (Deuter. v. 23). The w ords: \"And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,\" refer to the fourth mode of punishment, viz., death by beheading with a sword. It is written: \"And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life\" (Gen. iii. 24). This flaming sword bears the name of \"Spirit\" and symbolizes the infliction of d eath meted out to transgressors of the commandments of the law. Having described the first precept, viz., the fear of the Lord, come we now to the second which is int imately associated with it and never separated from it; tha t is, perfect love which everyone should cherish an d entertain towards their Creator. If it he asked, what is perf ect love, it is love of perfection, the one great l ove, as it is written: \"Walk before me and be thou perfect\" (Gen. xvii. 1) . Furthermore, the scripture says: \"And God said le t there be Light\" (Gen. i. 3). By the word Light is meant perf ect love. Then spake Rabbi Eleazar and said: My father, I hav e heard a definition of it which has just been give n unto me. Rabbi Simeon said: Then let Rabbi Pinchus hear it, now that he is here present. Said Rabbi Eleazar: Perfect love is that which manifests itself in two different ways or aspects and merits only to be called such. There are those who love Go d if he grants them wealth, length of days. offspring, worldly prosperity and success in their business enterpris es, but hate and disregard him if the wheel of destiny or the good l aw brings them misfortune and suffering. p. 75 [paragraph continues] Perfect love is that which changes not, but contin ues and abides the same in all circumstances, be they joyous or adverse. We should therefore love God even if he takes from us life, health, yea eve rything we hold dear. When Rabbi Eleazar had ceased speaking, Rabbi Simeo n, his father, embraced him, and Rabbi Pinchus than ked him and said: Truly the Holy One has brought me hither in order to behold the great Pearl whose radiant li ght will ere long illuminate the world. Rabbi Eleazar began speaking again: The fear of the Lord is inseparable from his commandments, especia lly that of perfect love, and happy the man in whose life and c onduct they are manifested and conjoined, as it is written: \"Happy is the man that feareth alway\" (Prov. xxviii . 14), for his fear and love are so associated that even if misfortunes assail and overwhelm, it matters not. H e is unmoved and his heart becomes not hardened so that he falls into sin. Again Rabbi Simeon spake and said: The third precep t is that which teaches there is an all powerful Be ing who is Lord of the Universe, and also to proclaim his unit y by the repetition12a of the six words of the Shem a, which correspond to the six directions in space, with a f ixed intention to do his will. The word One in the Shema should be equal in the duration of its pronunciation to the s ix words. This is the reason why the scripture sait h: \"Let the waters be gathered together in one place\" (Gen. i. 9), tha t is, that the waters of the rivers running into th e ocean may testify of the unity of the six directions. Stress should b e laid also upon the letter \"d\" in the word echad ( one), the numerical of it being equal to four and indicating the four d irections of the rivers. For this reason this lette r in the word echad occurring in this verse is always written larger than the ot hers. The attestation of the six points or directio ns having been made, should be confirmed by six other words: \"Blessed be his glorious name forever.\" In recogniz ing this unity symbolized by the letter d, man walks on dry land that brings forth trees and fruits. This also is why God called the dry land, earth, which is twice mentione d, land and earth being one and the same. \"And God saw that it was good,\" symbolizing the unity above and the unit y below. When this took place the earth was able to bring forth fruits and flowers. The fourth precept teaches that Jehovah is Lord, as it is written: \"Know therefore this day and consid er it in thine heart, p. 76"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon th e earth beneath; there is none else\" (Deuter. iv. 3 9). The word Alhim is in the divine name to show that they are o ne and the same, and12a-12b without distinction in nature or essence as implied in the words: \"Let there be Meor oth (lights) in the firmament of heaven\" (Gen. i. 1 4). This word is written without a V, being singular in its form to show that they, Jehovah and Alhim, are a unity, and not a duality. This is also symbolized by the pillar of c loud by day and the pillar of fire by night going b efore Israel in the desert, representing the divine Being who giveth li ght and guidance to all the world. In this consiste d the sin of the serpent; he acknowledged the divine unity below but promulgated a multiplication above, a doctrine whi ch has wrought great mischief and strife in the world. Man ought to acknowledge distinction below but unity o n high, that is, distinction of the divine Being from the world, but unity of essence and nature which when recogni zed and universally acknowledged, then will the demon of ev il and strife disappear from amongst mankind and ha ve no longer power and influence in the world. This is al so the occult meaning of \"Let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven\" (Gen. i, 15). The word A U R (light) is also a symbol of the divine unity as its letters ar e in alphabetical sequence. A first, then U, followed by R. This, how ever, is not the case with the word Muth (death) in which the letters are found inverted. M being the thirteenth letter of the Alphabet, U the sixth and Th the twen ty-second. Now Meoroth is compounded of the two words A U R and Mu th. If or be taken from it, Muth remains the symbol of death and separation. It was by these letters that Eve became the cause of evil in the world as the sc ripture saith: \"And then the woman saw the tree was good\" (Gen. ii i. 6), she took the letters M V from Meoroth and wi th Th thus formed Muth, death, which then first entered into t he world. Then said Rabbi Eleazar: My father, we have learned that when the letter M was left, V, the symbol of life, took its departure. Eve then took the letter Th and added it to M as it is said: \"And she took and gave to her husband\" (Gen. iii. 6), and thus formed Muth (death). In order how ever to counteract its effects it is necessary to a dd further to it the letter A, whose numerical value is unity and symbol of the divine Being. Muth then becomes Ameth (trut h), by which the world is saved. Said Rabbi Simeon: Happy art thou my son for the same explanation of the wor d has also been imparted to me. p. 77 The fifth precept. It is written: \"Let the waters b ring forth abundantly the moving creatures that hav e life\" (Gen. i. 20). In these words are included three commands, ha ving reference to the study of the secret doctrine, the multiplication of the human species and circumcisio n on the eighth day after the birth of a male child . He who addicts and gives himself up to the study and acqui sition of esoteric science becomes eventually unite d to his higher self and equal to angels.12b-13a Thus it is said: \" Oh ye his angels, bless ye the Lord\" (Ps. cxi. 20), signifying students of the secret doctrine who are called his angels upon earth as intimated in: the words, \"and fowl that may fly above the earth\" (Gen. i. 20), (also in Is. xl. 31): \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles\" and so he able to go throughout the world as teachers and ex ponents of the truth that saves and purifies the souls and enl ightens the minds of men. Thus the words, \"fowl tha t may fly above the earth\" refer to students of esoteric teaching c alled in scripture \"waters.\" They are able to mount up to the great fountain of divine truth and partake of its living waters. That it might be so with him, David prayed: \"Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me\" (Ps . li. 10), that is, incline and open my heart for t he study of the mysteries and occult meanings of thy word, and rene w me with a right spirit, or, in other words, let m y higher and lower nature become purified and unified. With reference to the sixth precept contained in th e words \" Increase and multiply ,\" he who conforms thereto increases the waters of the celestial river of life which never become dried up, but rather augmented by the birth of children. Every human soul, when it descends on to the earth plane, is accompanied by two attendant an gels, one on the right side of it, the other on the left, as it is said: \" He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways .\" If, however, a man does wrong, they become his a ccusers. Said Rabbi Pinchus: There really are three protecti ng angels to a good man as we read: \" If there be a messenger or angel with him, or an interpreter, one among a thou sand to plead his uprightness .\"Job 33:23 \"If there be an angel,\" refers to the first; \"An interpreter,\" to the secon d; \"One among a thousand,\" the third. Rabbi Simeon replied and said: As a matter of fact there are five guardian angels to each person, for the scripture further p. 78 proceeds: \" He will be gracious unto him and will say .\" \" He will be gracious ,\" specifies the fourth; whilst \" he will say ,\" denotes the fifth. Then said Rabbi Pinchus: Thy words are not altogeth er exact, for as much as \" He will be gracious \" refers to the Holy One, since compassion and graciousness belong only to Him. Thou speakest truly, replied Rabbi Sim eon, for whoever ignores the precept \" Increase and multiply \" obstructs the flow or course of the celestial riv er of life and thus violates and profanes the holy covenant. Of su ch it is written: \" They shall go forth and look upon the carcases"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"of the men that have transgressed against me .\"Is. 66:24 \" Against me ,\" because this is a sin against God. The souls of such men will never enter unto the palace of the Ki ng, but be cast forth to live and dwell in the dark ness and error of earth life. The seventh precept has reference to the circumcisi on of male children on the eighth day of birth, by which, bodily impurity is taken away. Of the celestial regions wh ither souls come forth to be incarnated on earth, o ne of them, the eighth in order, is termed Haya (living). This is the reason why circumcision is p erformed on the eighth day of birth. In the ancient book of Enoch, the course of the cel estial river of life is described as resembling the letter Yod ( \u0001י\u0001 ) which enters into the composition of the seventy-tw o divine names imprinted on the body of a child at time of birth, and denotes its purity. The words: \" And fowl that shall fly above the earth \" allude to Elijah, who is present whenever the rite of circumcision is performed, when a thron e or seat is formed and set specially for him by pr onouncing the words: \"This is Elijah's throne.\" If this is neglec ted, he does not attend. Furthermore, we read: \"And God created great whales or fishes,\" alluding to the two great fishes called Leviathan, symbolizing the male and f emale principle that manifests itself in every part of the creation . The words: \" and every living creature \" refer to the sacred name imprinted on the bodies of all incarnated souls com ing from the celestial region called Haya . \"Which the waters brought forth abundantly,\" denotes the letter Yod ( \u0001י\u0001 ) with which, as a sign, the angels above are disti nguished from demons and also the children of Israel from other n ations of the earth, viz., the impure and idolatrou s. Blessed is the lot of Israel! The eighth precept is that relating to the kindness to be shown to the proselyte who consents to be ci rcumcised in order to p. 79 enjoy the protection of the sheltering wings of the Schekina, or13a-13b divine Presence, that guards a nd defends all those who, forsaking the worship of demons, give th emselves up to the service of the true God. Thus it is written: \" Let the earth bring forth, the living creature afte r its kind .\" The esoteric or mystical meaning of the words \" after its kind ,\" which are repeated twice in this verse of script ure, is as follows. The wings of the Schekina denot e two celestial regions with many separate divisions or l ocalities, whither the souls of proselytes return a fter separation from the body. The region included under the right wing contains two divisions through which pass the souls of the children of Israel, when after death they ascend to the celestial locality called Haya. The left wing with its two divisions is reserved for the nations of Ammon and Moab. All souls, however, whether they come forth f rom Haya, or Ammon and Moab, are living creatures differing i n their kind, being those of Israel or those of pro selytes who, as stated, ascend to the regions under the right wing of the Schekina. A further allusion to this mystery occurs in the words: \" And ye shall be a delightful land .\"Mal 3:12 For this reason Israel is called ben yaqir (a dear son), because the Lord has given him a better portion than that o f the proselytes. The children of Israel are also c alled \" those whom I carry in my bosom ,\" viz., the beautiful land to which, having ascend ed after death, they shall go out no more. The scriptures proceed further, \" cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth af ter his kind ,\" teaching us that animals differ in their natures and forms, though animated with the same breath and life, so human souls, thou gh differing the one from the other, nevertheless derive their o rigin from the same divine source. The ninth precept has reference to the poor and ind igent, ministering to their necessities as it is wr itten: \" Let us make man in our image, after our likeness .\" \"Let us make man.\" Here the plural form of expre ssion is used in order to point out that the creation of man was effected by the two divine essences symbolized as the male and female. \"In our image,\" betokens the rich, corresponding to the male, \"after our likeness,\" the poor, correspondin g to the female. Now just as the two divine essences form a single w hole, so amongst men ought these two classes, the r ich and poor, symbols of the male and female principles in the di vine nature, to form one mutually co-operative whol e or community. \" And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle , and p. 80 every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ,\" the mystical13b meaning of which is given and ex plained in an occult work by King Solomon thus: \"Whose has compas sion on the poor, from his face and countenance wil l never fade away the reflection and glory of the divine li keness borne by the first man, by which he ruled an d dominated the whole animal creation.\" As it is said: \" And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be u pon every beast of the earth, the fowl of the air, every creeping thing an d the fish in the sea, etc .\" All these tremble and fear before the presence of man, because of the divine image imprin ted thereon and is the only law of the creator enjo ined upon the animal world that instills them with fear because o f this image, first born by Adam. As long as man en tertains and cherishes compassion and sympathy for the poor, he will continue to bear it. While he exercises charit y he is truly human; when he ceases and refrains therefrom, he be comes and continues merely an animal. How can this be substantiated? From the life of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian monarch, whose dream of his own downfal l was never realized whilst succoring the poor. Immediate ly he ceased from deeds of charity and compassion a nd suffered"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"himself to become filled with pride of heart and va inglory, then was heard the voice of the heavenly w atcher: \" The Kingdom is departed from thee ,\" that is, the seal and stamp of the divine born b y Adam, vanished from him and he ceased to be human. \" His heart became changed and a beast's heart was gi ven him and he was driven out from amongst men and dwelt with the beasts of the field .\" For this reason the scripture in order to expres s the creation of man, makes use of the words: \" Let us make man ,\" to indicate that to preserve the divine image, w e should be charitable and compassionate, as was the rich and a ffluent Boaz to Ruth. The tenth precept concerns the fixing and girding o f the phylacteries. Said Rabbi Simeon; \" Thy head upon thee is like Carmel (Garden).\"Cant. 7:5 These words have already been commented upon, but they have another and deeper meaning. \" Thy head upon thee \" refers to the phylactery of the head which repres ents the divine head, or, in other words, the divine name IHVH of which each of the le tters stands for a verse of scripture which placed within the four sections of spaces of the phylactery of the he ad, correspond to the letters of the divine name. T his is why we are taught by tradition that the words of scripture, \" And all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee ,\"Deut. 28:10 refers only to this p. 81 phylactery.13b-14a The first space or compartment c ontains the verse \" Sanctify unto me all the first born whatsoever openeth the womb .\"Ex. 13:2 Connoting the first letter of the Tetrag rammaton, viz., I ( \u0001י\u0001 ) symbol of the first of all divine origins. This letter opens as i t were the womb of the second, H, whereby it become s fruitful. In the second space is enclosed the words: \" and it shall be when the Lord shall bring forth int o the land ,\"Ex. 13:5 referring to the second letter, H, whose womb as just stated is opened by Yod. In the Sepher Yetsirah we read, b y fifty gates or openings of the celestial and concealed temple, the Yod enters and penetrates into H, that the soun d of the schophar or trumpet may be heard. The schophar is s ecurely closed until Yod comes and opens it and mak es its sound heard, typifying freedom and the enfranchisem ent of the slaves and bondmen. It was by the sound of the schophar that the children of Israel marched out of Egypt, so will it always he, hereafter, the herald of freedom and deliverance. Such is the esoteric explanation of th e letter H. The third space or section contains the Shema. \" Hear Oh Israel, the Lord our God is one God ,\"Deut 6:4 and is a commentary on the letter V (vau ) which proceeds from the two letters before it and unities them. The fou rth space contains words of blessingsDeut. 11:13-21 and menaces to the congregation of Israel, by the observance of which they should become the happiest and most pow erful amongst the nations of the world. It connotes the final , H, fourth letter of the divine name and is formed from and includes in it the other three preceding letters. F rom these observations we may gather the occult mea ning of the phylacteries. They are really explanations of the l etters of the Tetragrammaton or divine name and the refore the scripture saith: \" Thy head upon thee is as Carmel ,\" and also: \" The hair of thy head is like purple .\" Now the word used for hair in this verse is not the ordinary ter m Saar, but daleth, which comes from the root word dal, signifying poverty denoted by the phylactery of the arm, as th at of the head denotes riches or wealth, and it is further added: \" the King is held in its plaits or tresses ,\" meaning that the divine name of God is in the fo ur compartments of the phylactery. Whoever wears the phylacteries bears th e divine likeness, for as the divine essence is exp ressed in the Tetragrammaton, so man becomes hearer of his image. Furthermore, it is said: \" Male and female created he them ,\" thus the phylacteries also symbolize the male and f emale, and taken together forth one unit or whole. Such is the symbolism of the phylacteries. p. 82 The eleventh precept has reference to the levying a nd giving of tithes on corn, and the product of fru it trees. Regarding the first, scripture states: \" And God said, behold, I have given you every herb b earing seed which is upon the face of all the earth ,\"14a and of the fruit trees: \" behold I have given the children of Levi all the te nth in Israel for an inheritance ,\"Num. 18:12 and also: \" All the tenth of the corn and of fruit trees are th e Lord's and consecrated to him .\"Lev. 27:30 The twelfth precept concerns the tithes on fruit tr ees, as it is written: \" every tree in which is the fruit of a tree, to you it shall be for food ,\" or, in other words, though it is unlawful to kee p what is consecrated to me I permit you to eat of the tenth of the products of the earth, whether of corn or trees, in order that they may serve as food to you and not to future generations. The thirteenth precept relates to the redemption or purchase of the first born and thus making its lif e assured, for there are two angels, one of which is the lord of l ife, the other the lord of death, always hovering n ear and about at the time of birth. When a man redeems his child fro m the power of the latter then has it no power or i nfluence over the life of his offspring. This is the esoteric mea ning of the words: \" And God saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good .\" The word good designates the angel lord of life, the word very t he angel lord of death. By redemption, the one is strengthened, the other enfe ebled and has, as we have just said, no longer powe r over the child."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The fourteenth precept has respect to resting and c easing from work on the sabbath day, as then God re sted from the work of creation. This precept is subdivided into t wo others: one enjoining rest on this day, the othe r teaching us to keep it holy. Concerning resting on the sabbath we have already s aid it was ordained, because the divine Being reste d from his work which he then finished. When, however, the sab bath commenced, there were certain creatures who ha d not received bodies in which to incarnate. The question may here arise could not the Holy One have retarde d the approach of the sabbath and thus have provided them with physical sheaths or bodies? The truth is, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had excited them to revo lt even before embodiment, through their great desire to descend into the world, or on to the earth, and mak e themselves lords and masters thereof. The Holy On e then divided these into two classes of which he placed o ne, the good, by the tree of life, and p. 83 the other, the had, by the tree, of knowledge of go od and evil. Whilst intent upon providing for the f ormer with bodily forms, the sabbath day dawned, and thus the work was interrupted and suspended. If these rebellious and ambitious spirits had acqui red bodies, the world would not have continued to e xist even for a moment. The Holy One had, however, provided a remed y against this prospective catastrophe by hastening the coming of the sabbath and therefore the world exist s and continues. What those wicked spirits thought of doing by the procreation of and filling the world with their offspring was accomplished by those good spirits b y the tree of life who from the night of the first sabbath discha rged this duty. 14a-14b This is why the wise and th ey who understand, restrict their connubial relationships to the day of the sabbath so that the wicked spirit s may recognize how inferior they are to those who, whilst incarnat ed, are able to discharge marital duties. It is the se wicked spirits who go forth in their hordes throughout the world w ith the hope of surprising anyone who violates and infringes the esoteric injunction respecting the conjugal act, th e offspring of which becomes afflicted with epileps y through becoming obsessed by Lilith, the great mother of th e demons, who kills and destroys the child. As soon as, however, the Sabbath day begins, and wh ilst it endures, these wicked spirits becoming fill ed with terror, fly quickly away and hide themselves, with the exce ption of one of them named Assimon who, with his attendants, is authorized to go through the world in order to seek and find out transgressors of the law relating to conjugal practice. When the night however has passed, he is obliged to go and hide himself in the great abyss o f darkness. The sabbath ended, hosts of demons reappear in the world, and therefore to ward off and be proof again st their evil influence and nullify their power, the reading of t he ninety-first Psalm has been enjoined. As soon as the demons observe the children of Israel engaged in prayer, a nd the reading of it and holding in their hands a c up of wine, they hurriedly rush away and disappear in deserts and so litary places in which they make their dens and hid ing places. May the Holy One ever keep and preserve us from the ir noxious power and influence! Our masters and great teachers (their names and mem ories be ever blessed) admonish us that there are t hree different ways by which a man may incur guilt and a ttract evil: either by invoking curses upon himself , by wastefully casting bread or crumbs p. 84 upon the ground, be they ever so small, and also at the conclusion14b of the sabbath by lighting a can dle before first reading or reciting the psalm or liturgy of \"separa tion\" and by thus doing, causing the fires of Gehen na to be lighted before their time. There is in Gehenna a place rese rved for those who break and profane the sabbath an d who enjoy a respite from its fiery punishment whilst the sabbat h endures and vent their maledictions and curses on them who light a candle before the prescribed time, saying: \"May God hurl theeIs. 22:17 in his fury and bring t hee hither and thus be tossed about as a ball so that thou becomes t an object of shame and reprobation to thy kith an d kindred.\" The sanctity of the sabbath as long as it lasts imp oses absolute rest both in the higher and lower wor lds, during which, the punishments of the wicked cease and thei r overlookers remain inactive until the children of Israel have finished reciting the words: \"Blessed art thou oh L ord who separateth the holy from the unholy.\" On hi m, however, who lights not his candle they invoke benedictions. Gen. 27:28 Deut. 28:3 Ps. 14:1\" God give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine. Blessed b e thou in the city and blessed be thou in the field, etc .\" \" Blessed is the man that considereth the poor, the L ord will deliver him in time of trouble .\" Why does the scripture use the words \"in time of trouble,\" in place of \"the evil day?\" Because the evil spirit then is able to obtain the mastery over the soul of a man, and then it is the Lord will deliver him. By the word dal (poor) is meant the humble sin-sick soul who repen ts of his sins against the Holy One. Another and further interpretation of the words: \" The Lord shall deliver him in time of trouble \" is that they allude to the last or judgment day.

Containing the doctrines of the Kabbalah, together with the discourses and teachings of its author, th e great Kabbalist, Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, and now for the first time translated into English with notes, ref erences, and expository remarks. BY NURHO DE MANHAR. SECTION I. GENESIS. (CREATION) \"BRASHITH.\" \"In the beginning\" was En Soph,15a the Divine, the self-existent infinite begin, without l ikeness or reflection, the incomprehensible, the unknowable On e, the blessed and only Potentate, the King of King s and Lord of Lords. who only hath immortality, dwelling in Li ght which no man can approach unto, whom no man hat h seen or can see, before whom the great archangel with fa ce beneath his wings bends in lowly reverence and a doration, crying, \"Holy! Holy! Holy! who art and was and ever more shall be.\" Tune had begun. Its great pendulum, whose beats are the ages, commenced to vibrate. The era of creatio n or manifestation had at last arrived. The nekuda reshi ma, primal point or nucleus, appeared. From it eman ated and expanded the primary substance, the illimitable pho sphorescent ether, of the nature of light, formless , colorless, being neither black nor green nor red. In it, laten t yet potentially as in a mighty womb, lay the myri ad prototypes and numberless forms of all created things as yet indis cernible, indistinguishable. By the secret and sile nt action of the divine will, from this primal luminous point radiat ed forth the vital life-giving spark which, pervadi ng and operating in the great, enteric ocean of forms, became the so ul of the universe, the fount and origin of all mun dane life and motion and terrestrial existence, and in its nature and essence and secret operation remains ineffable , incomprehensible and indefinable. It has been conce ived of as the divine Logos, the Word, and called B rashith, for the same was in the beginning with God. p. 86 [paragraph continues] (All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life became the light of man.) \"They that understand (the secret doctrine) shall s hine as the brightness of the firmament; and they w ho turn or lead many into the might path (of knowledge) as the star s forever and ever.\" (Dan. xii. 3.) The word zohar (brightness) designates that nekuda reshima, the central ray or point of light which was the primal manifestation o f the Divine, En Soph. From it proceeded vibrations which made lu minous the illimitable ether, from which was formed the universe that became the glorious temple or palace of the great Unknown. It was in a manner the holy s eed or germ that gave origin and birth to the world, and is occ ultly referred to in the words: \"The holy seed shal l be the substance thereof.\" (Is. vi. 13.) Its analogue in nature is t he silkworm which, unseen and in secret, elaborates and prepares a product that ultimately constitutes the material of the monarch's purple robe of splendor. Furthermore , for the manifestation of the glory of the divine Unknown to humanity, making use of verbal terms and letters, it has built for it the name15a-15b alhim, or lord, as evidenced in the mystic sense of brashith bara alhim. \"In th e beginning, alhim created\"; or, as it should be rendered by rus hith, that is the primal zohar, the origin of all w ords, \"God created alhim.\" The use of the word bara (created) need not excite surprise, for it occurs again in the words: \"And he created alhim, the man, in his image.\" (Gen. i. 27.) This z ohar, their, denotes the mysterious. One called bra shith because the beginning of all things. In answer to the desire of Moses to know the name of the divine Being, it was given AHIH ASHR AHIH, \"I am that or who I am.\" The sacred name AHIH is as a two-sided figure, whilst the name alh im is as a crown; and asher formed of the same letters as th e word rash (head or crown) is a synonym of alhim a nd proceeds or comes forth from brashith. Whilst the primal zoh ar or divine ray of life was quiescent and unmanife sted it was impossible for it to become known by any word or te rm whatsoever. But after operating in the boundless ether, the receptacle of all forms and prototypes of created t hings in the universe that was to be, then asher, r epresenting the divine essence, took upon itself the form of a head or crown (rash) between the two AHIH's of the divi ne appellation, AHIH asher AHIH. Observe now, that the word brashith is composed of rash (crown), synonym of asher, and beth (house p. 87 or palace). Hence the occult signification or rende ring of the words \"Brashith bara Alhim\" is this: Wh en rash the divine germ from which emanated and expanded the bo undless ether appeared, and this ether became diffe rentiated into form and color giving rise to the universe or palace of the great king, then was created alhim th e great secret"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"fructifying principle of nature, which was and is a s a point that gives rise to lines which produce su rfaces, or as the letter yod I, whence proceed all the other letters of the alphabet. Again, from another aspect, when zohar the primal l uminous point or ray gave rise to the emanating eth er, it took. upon itself the form of the vowels holem ( \u0001ֹ\u0001 ) shurek ( \u0001ּ\u0001 ) and hirek ( \u0001ִ\u0001 ) which are different dispositions of the one and same elementary point in their esoteric meaning . When the primal vibration of the divine word took p lace it produced and impressed a wavelike motion th roughout the boundless ether in which were contained all the sounds of the alphabet from A to Th. This operatio n and effect is symbolized by the union of these two letters formin g the word ath as it is found written ath ha-shamay im (the heavens). Thus: Brashith bara Alhim ath hashamayim signify: He, the unknown mysterious One, created al him the fructifying and generative principle of the heavens , one in origin but dual in operation. Hence it is seen that the divine word and essence designated by the word ashe r is found between the fecundative and generative p rinciples, both of which are symbolized by the same name AHIH in the divine appellation AHIH asher AHIH. The Zohar (brightness) also denotes the generative essence and includes all the letters taken as types and forms of creatures and things in its operation. Such also is the signification of the verse: \"Jehovah, our God is one Jehovah\"15b (Deut. vi. 4), containing three names e xpressive of the three gradations of the divine ess ence, as exhibited in the three first words of Genesis. \"Bra shith balm Alhim ath hashamayim.\" Brashith specifie s the mysterious divine Being; bara, the mystery of creat ion: alhim, the mystery of preservation: ath hasham ayim, the fructifying and generative principles considered as one. If to the word ath be added h from the follow ing word hashamayim (heavens) we get the pronominal term ath ah (thou)--Alhim, the divine Being to which the scr ipture alludes. \"Thou ( Athah) givest life to all creature s.\" (Nehem. ix. 6). In this deeply mysterious ath, therefore, is comprehended the divine essence in its fructifying p. 88 and generative form, and Alhim the point of union b etween them; and it may thus be regarded as a mysti c analogue, though dimly and obscurely, of that majestic unknow n Being that operated in the creation and productio n of the illimitable universe, whose goodness and beneficenc e are manifested in the preservation of the world w ith its myriads of creatures, who in their fructifying and generative powers and functions are finite replica of Himself, the \"I am that I am.\" In concluding these remarks on th is first verse in Genesis,15b-16a observe that bras hith (in the beginning) is equivalent to bra-shith (he created s ix) and refers to the scriptural words: \"From one s ide of the heaven to the other,\" that is, to the six directions of sp ace (north, south, east, west, above, and below), a ll converging to the three points representing the divine essence, which are one and the same, the mystery of which is incl uded and hidden in the divine name composed of forty-two let ters. \"They that are wise shall shine,\"Dan. 12:3 i.e., th ose who are initiated into the secret doctrine. The y are like the notes and accents in music by which musicians and s ingers are guided and led in their playing and chan ting, as troops that follow their leader and chief. The cons onants and vowels are the chief elements in the for mation of words, but the wise alone by their understanding gi ve life and meaning to them. \"Those who turn many i nto the right way (of knowledge) shall shine as the stars forever and ever.\" By the word stars is meant the signs of punctuation used to separate the parts of a sentence and render the words intelligible, and thus are teachers and students of the secret doctrine. who, by their intellectual and spi ritual enlightenment and knowledge of esoteric scie nce. cause earth's ofttimes weary wandering and belated pilgri ms to find the true path of light that leads them t o the higher and diviner life. happy are they engaged in the work of guiding others into the right way! Around them is a halo which the prophet Ezekiel beheld in vision encircling the heads of cherubim, the brightness and refulgence o f which shall never become faded or dimmed but endure forever. \"And the earth was tohu and bohu\" (Gen. i. 2), that is, without form and void. The word \"was\" relating to the past, is here used to indicate the primeval state of the ear th at the time of its creation. The water covering the earth was cold as snow and impregnated and contaminated with mud a nd debris which by the action of a strong fire cong ested and hardened and p. 89 the space or place it occupied in becoming separate d from the water was called Tohu, or the place of w aste and dregs, and corresponded to the evil demons that mad e it their abode. Bohu, on the contrary, was that p art or portion of the earth that became purified. If it be asked: by the action of what power was this purification a ccomplished, the scripture answers:16a \"Darkness was upon the face o f the deep.\" The term darkness refers to the fire o r light which, though of divine origin, existed like a nebulous da rk cloud at the beginning of creation. \"And the spi rit of God proceeded from the lord of life and hovered or move d upon the face of the waters.\" (Gen. i. 2). After impregnating them with the breath of life, and causing them to b ecome purified and fructified, then from out of the state of Tohu came forth a great and mighty wind that overthrew m ountains and broke into pieces the rocks, similar i n its effects to the sight beheld by the prophet Elijah, as it is written; \"after the wind, an earthquake\" (I. Kings xix. 12), that"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"dispelled the darkness in which was the hidden and concealed fire that transformed the world from tohu into Bohu, and from a state of chaos made it receptive of seed s and germs of life. This is expressed in the words ; \"and after the fire a still small voice\" (I. Kings xix., 12). Tohu was thus a state of chaos in which the world e xisted for ages after its first creation, enshroude d in darkness and immersed in water. By the action of fire, in its qu alities of heat and flame, and the concomitant oper ation of the divine spirit, the constituent elements became diff erentiated and each imbued with energies and powers of attraction and cohesion, as also of repulsion, and thus prepar ed to be taken up and used in the elaboration of ma terial forms and bodies in which pre-existing spiritual entities or beings might incarnate and manifest themselves in accordance with laws regulating and governing their birth, gro wth and development. This preparatory and progressi ve stage in the world's physical history was what is termed boh u, a state of darkness which was at the same time a n allotrophic form of the divine light that in its infinite modes of energy and operation pervaded the vast expanse, making it pregnant with the germs of life that eventually cam e forth out of the earth's mighty womb and began th eir ascent on the spiral curve of evolutionary existence; until, after aeons of upward struggle and ceaseless endeav or, they attained their destiny, becoming children of Light, assimila ted in the grandeur of their expanded faculties of mind and heart with the great Father of Light, the p. 90 [paragraph continues] Holy One (blessed be He), whose love and beneficen ce to all his creatures are as great as his power, and who knows neither measure nor end. \"And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the w aters\"; and then went forth the fiat of the divine word: \"Let there be light and light was\" (Gen. i. 3), light ra diant and glittering with a thousand different colo rs and rays, fringing and embellishing all objects with a halo a nd sheen of beauty and splendor, entering into and informing each atom and evoking its latent life and energy and exc iting it to the display and exercise of its inheren t properties and functions in the great economy of nature. In all the various phases of development from tohu to bohu,16a-16b through countless ages of silent, s ecret and ceaseless progression from lower to higher stages a nd states of being, the Divine has manifested itsel f under many and different aspects or characters corresponding t o and symbolical of them. Thus, whilst the earth wa s in a state of chaos, it manifested itself as Shaddai, the Almight y; and when it passed from the state of tohu to boh u, as Sabaoth, or Hosts. When darkness disappeared, then became it known as Alhim. But not until the life-giving word was spoken, did it become known as Jehovah, the \"I am t hat I am.\" This is wherefore the scripture states i n the vision of Elijah: \"Jehovah was not in the earthquake\" (I. Kin gs xix. 2), but Shaddai. Jehovah was not in the fir e (I. Kings, xix. 12), but was \"Sabaoth.\" \"After the fire a darkness made visible,\" it manifested as Alhim; then was hea rd the still small voice and the name Jehovah was complete, the four letters of which serve as symbols of the divin e essence as the hands and feet represent the human frame. Taking now the tetragrammaton or holy name, AHIH, m anifested in these three aspects or forms of cosmic development, we find the divine appellation of twel ve letters, AHIH asher AHIH, the name revealed to t he prophet Elijah. \"And God said: Let there be light and light was.\" Proceed we now to investigate and acquaint ourselve s with the hidden mysteries and teachings of the se cret doctrine regarding creation which have just been outlined in a general manner. Hitherto we have dwelt upon the secret operation of En Soph or the unknown infinite and et ernal Being in preparing the earth and impregnating its substance with a mysterious divine virtue or power which rendered it capable of becoming the medium fo r the enfoldment and manifestation of pre-existing p. 91 spiritual entities and beings. These effects achiev ed, there was needed the omnific, life-giving Logos or Word to originate and utter the symphonal vibration that sh ould impart life and breath and motion to the unive rse. Then and not till then was it spoken; then and not till then the celestial and terrestrial worlds becoming boun d and associated together by a reciprocal influence, a new and a liv ing way was opened for the incarnation and exhibiti on of life upon the earth. This is why in the antecedent primal sta ges of development in the world's history the expre ssion \"God said,\" is not found in scripture. At first he wille d, as the Arabic version gives it, and his will ope rated silently, slowly, yet surely and effectively. The primary sub stance of the earth being thus prepared, it was thr ough the mysterious action of the Word that it became endowe d with vital properties and attributes through the divine vibration imparted to it. This is what scripture af firms: \"And God said,\" that is, Alhim manifested hi mself by and through the divine Logos; and thus by and through t he Word, produced motion or vibration under the law s of which created matter, or substance, resolved itself into an infinitude of different forms. \"Let light be.\" Now the word yehe (he) is composed of16b three letters, IHI, yod being the first and t hird letter and H coming between them. The yod, or I, represents th e male and the female principle. The full word is t herefore a symbol of the divine Father and Mother, the final y od being the same as the first in order to show tha t all the three"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"aspects or forms as stated, under which En Soph ope rated in the creation and production of the univers e, were only the manifestations of one and the same divine Being . The first yod also designates the Father, the eng enderer of light; the second letter H denotes the Logos; the t hird letter yod , the primal light. The divine aspects are further symbolized by the three vowel points, holem ( \u0001ֹ\u0001 ) shurek ( \u0001ּ\u0001 ) and hirek ( \u0001ִ\u0001 ) the Father, the Word and the Light. Before the manifestation of the Logos seven other l etters were formed, but the primal light proceeding from the Father was too ethereal and empyreal to receive and become impressed with their forms and signatures. When, however, the state, of tohu gave place to that of b ohu, other seven letters were formed; but, again, a s matter was not sufficiently condensed, it could not retain them. A t the manifestation of the creative Logos, eight ot hers completing the letters of the alphabet were formed, which endu red because by the action of the Logos, the barrier between the spiritual and p. 92 earthly was done away and they began to exercise a reciprocal influence on each other. This is the occ ult meaning of the words: \"Let there be a firmament\" and thus form a medium, a point of union between the higher and lower worlds. This taking place was the prelude to the ap pearance of life upon the earth. \"God saw the light that it was good\" (Gen. i. 4), f or then the universe became lighted up and pervaded throughout with the divine life which preserves it for the com mon weal and happiness of created and animated bein gs.16b-17a \"And God called the light Day\" (Gen. i. 5). Why is it written: \"He called\"? Because Alhim wished or wi lled an emanation distinct from the Logos, which should con stitute the world-soul, the foundation root of univ ersal life. This light emanation, the life of the world, is ter med Day, representing and corresponding to the firs t AHIH in the divine appellation \"I am that I am.\" \"And the darkn ess he called Night.\" That is, He produced from out of the primal darkness a passive or reflected light like that of the moon and called it Night. It was by the union of Day and Night, symbolizing l ight and darkness, the male and female principles, that the Logos or creative Word proceeded. This mystery is a lso symbolized by the vowel points ( \u0001ֹ\u0001 ) ( \u0001ּ\u0001 ) ( \u0001ִ\u0001 ). When the creative and passive light blend and unite, that is , when the active male principle unites with the pa ssive female principle, an equilibrium is established and procre ation takes place. The union of these two lights or principles gives rise to a sense of pleasure and delight which has b een personified as the goddess Venus, and is known and termed in the secret doctrine as \"Musaph\" (something addition al, augmentation) without which life would not be w orth living. This it was that caused all as yet unembodied spiri ts and holy souls to be filled with a joyous longin g and desire for incarnation on the earth plane and thereby attain t o higher states and stages of existence and thus ap proximate nearer to the great Being who in scripture is termed Jehov ah, Zebaoth, the Lord of Hosts, God of all the coun tless myriads of created souls and Lord of all the earth. From wh at has just been said it will be perceived that the words Day and Night in scripture are symbols of the heavenly or d ivine lights from the synthesis of which creation, as it exists, has resulted. \"And God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters\" (Gen. i. 6). In these words the scr ipture begins to unfold and display in detail the various processes in mundane creation p. 93 which began by dividing the waters above from the w aters below. Amongst the many antinomies of existen ce by which we are able to distinguish their nature and t hus attain unto truth, the conception of right and left will hest assist us in understanding and grasping the secret doctrine contained in these words, the right corres ponding to light, goodness, harmony; the left, to darkness, evil, dis cord, from which has proceeded that state called Ge henna or Hell, a subject upon which Moses himself pondered and tho ught deeply and long in his studies on this part of Genesis. In the work of creation there was a differentiation of the divine essence resulting in two states of the primal substance,17a-17b called light and darkness, connot ed also by the terms right and left. When Alhim, th e creative mean, or word, appeared and became a point of union between them, they began to blend harmoniously tog ether and thus gave occasion for the appearance of vegetable and animated existences. Discord vanished and peace universally prevailed. This primal discord between the light an d darkness, the right and left, may be illustrated by the quarrel and contention that arose between Korah, and his as sociates, and Aaron, the high priest. After his stu dies on the great problem of the origin of Gehenna, Moses thus reasoned to himself: I must adjust and harmonize th is difference and discord between Korah and Aaron on the principl e of reconciliation that prevailed and operated bet ween light and darkness at the time of creation, that is, I mu st become a mediator between them. Finding, however , that the contention on the part of Korah was of a stubborn a nd inflexible character, he said truly: This opposi tion and difference between the two parties, Korah and Aaron , is altogether different from what prevailed betwe en primeval light and darkness, and though willing to mediate a nd make peace and harmony between them, Korah and h is company have rejected and refused my counsels and t hus have instituted and made a Gehenna or Hell into which they must eventually fall. In refusing to accept an d comply with the proposition of Moses, Korah demon strated that his fend and dispute had not for its object the adv ancement of the divine glory. He thus became an apo state and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"renegade to the divine rule or principle of reconci liation, by which opposites blend and work harmonio usly together. In this consisted the sin of Korah and his company, which caused Moses, though of great meekness of ch aracter, to be filled with wrath and anger, not because of thei r rejection of him as a mediator, but on account of their adverse opposition p. 94 and antagonism to the principles of reconciliation, the existence of which they failed to perceive or ignored as operating in the preservation of the world. The following remarks are from an ancient occult wo rk entitled Liber Adami , or, The Book of Adam. \"When the passive light, termed in scripture 'darkness,' beca me blended and unified with the active light,17b th ere were myriads of spiritual beings or existences, part of whom were fully developed and ready for incarnation , the rest but imperfectly so. Believing that the light and darkne ss were antagonistic in nature and principle, there arose a division of opinion amongst them, some declaring themselves partisans of light, others its opponents and advoca tes of darkness. When the mediating Logos had blended ligh t and darkness and thus symbolized the perfect unit y of the divine essence, the advanced and enlightened amongs t them embraced and received the fact, whilst those only partially developed remained obdurate in their idea s and opinions and thus by their contrariety and di fferences of thought and the contentions and quarrels that arose therefrom, Gehenna or Hell came into existence.\" T his discord and dissension has found an entrance and reflection in the world and is distinguished by the object in view, whether it be actuated by desire for truth or motived by se lfishness and a hankering and craving to rule and d ominate over others. Examples and instances of these two classes of individuals are found in the history of mankind . Of the first class, were the famed teacher Hillel (nasior presid ent of the school of Jerusalem at the beginning of the Christian era) with his colleague Schammai. Their only object was the research of truth and the advancement of t he divine glory, and though their disputes were very keen and sharp, yet friendship and good will always existed between them. Of the second class, an example has just been given in the case of Korah and his party in their contention with Aaron for supremacy, which resulted in their destru ction and descent into Hell, the limbo and native p lace of dissension and discord. We can now discern the reason why God made the firm ament and separated the waters that were above from the waters that were beneath, that is, he caused a clea r distinction to be made between those who, enterta ining different views and opinions, were actuated by the desire for truth, and those whose object, through crass, self -willed ignorance, was the rejection of and antagonism towa rds it. In connection with Korah and his company, p. 95 cut off or separated from the congregation of Israe l, the same word, yabdel (separated), is used by Al him in dividing the waters above and the waters beneath the firmame nt, as also by Moses when he spake: Deut. 10:8\"Seem eth it to you a small thing that the God of Israel hath separ ated yon from the congregation,\" etc., and further, \"the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord.\"17b-18a Here the question may arise: If on the second day o f creation the separation between light and darknes s occurred, how was it that the quarrel arose with Levi the thi rd tribe of the children of Israel? Should it not h ave been in connection with Simeon, the second tribe? The fact of the case is this: the tribe of Levi though recko ned the third, in the eye of Jacob, was accounted as second. The form of service called separation recited by the childr en of Israel at the close of the sabbath has for its object the sep aration of the spirit ruling during weeks days from the spirit that rules and presides over the sabbath day. When the s abbath closes, the wicked spirit is filled with the desire to acquire ascendency over Israel, but as soon as it h ears the recitation of the verse: \"Let the beauty o f the Lord our God he upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea the work of our hands establish thou it\" (Ps. xc. 17), it betakes itself to flight, and when with the sprig of myrtle and cup of wine in hand the wo rd of \"separation\" is spoken, it hurries away and returns to Gehenna w hence it came, its own place, where dwell Korah and his company as it is written: \"They and the accomplices went down alive into the pit\" (Num. xvi. 33). They were not, however, swallowed up until the congregation of Isr ael had separated itself from them, even as the des cent into hell of the wicked and contentious angels occurs only af ter the repetition of the formula of separation at the close of the sabbath. There are two Gehennas; one above, where a re the wicked and rebellions spirits; and the other , whither Korah descended and is the pattern of the former. \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water s\" (Gen. i. 6). The word Alhim, God, is composed of two words AL-HIM, which signify God, water, or sea. This last word has the same letters as yamah, by which the s cripture teaches that all division of opinion, symbolized by the term sea, is right and just when its object is the glory of the divine, as then AL becomes united to HIM. When, how ever, this is not so, AL remains separated and deta ched and yamah, or HIM, then symbolizes the great p. 96"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"ocean or abyss of darkness in which Hell is enshrou ded18a and concealed. When the waters became separa ted, then Alhim interposed and became the point of union betw een them, and harmony prevailed and dissension ceas ed. The waters above the firmament, the male part; those be low, the female. Those above were designated Alhim, and distinguished by the first H in the divine name IHV H; those below were called Adonai, and characterize d by the second H. Although the mediation of Alhim took plac e on the second day, unity and harmony did not begi n to prevail only on the third day when, as the scriptur e states: \"God saw that it was good,\" which is not affirmed of either the first or second day of the work of creat ion. It was then the letter V entered in the divine name and took up its position between the two H's. This interpositio n and mediation of Alhim, between the waters above and those below the firmament, is further symbolized by the w aters of the river JordanJosh. 3:16 when they becam e separated to allow of the passage of the children of Israel i nto the promised land. The waters flowing down to t he place of passage formed into a heap, whilst those below flow ed into the sea and the children of Israel passed o ver between them. In order to distinguish and emphasize the sep aration of the waters which, had not Alhim become m ediator between them. would never have proved fruitful and brought forth abundantly the living creature, the s cripture repeats five times the word raqiang (firmament). Now the time essential for this correlative union w as a period of five hundred years, during which the waters above and those below flowed unitedly by the tree of life , serving as a point of contact and junction, so th at by their reciprocal action they might give rise to vegetable and animal life upon the earth plane. This union o r blending together was thus necessary ere their proper distri bution could take place, as it is recorded of David after gathering together food and provisions, he afterwards distrib uted them2 Sam. 6:19 to all the congregation of Isr ael. It is also written: \"That thou givest them, they gather\" (Ps. civ. 28), and again, \"She riseth also whilst it is night, and giveth meat to her household\" (Prov. xxxi. 15). Next: Chapter II. p. 97 WHEN discord prevailed between the elements, a pret ernatural and extraordinary degree of coldness pred ominated throughout the world and the waters below became co ngealed and arid, giving birth to two demons, one m ale, the other female, who engendered myriads of beings simi lar to themselves in order to add to and increase t he forces of disorder and disruption. Herein consists the secret symbolism of circumcision.18a One of these demons is called Apheth (viper) and the other Nachash (serpent.) The y are one and the same in their natures. After unio n with Nachash, and seven years of gestation, Apheth depos ited offspring on the earth. Herein also is the mys tery of the seven names of Gehenna, as also of the seven names of the tempter spirit. Thus everything emanating an d proceeding from the sphere of darkness is a medley of good and evil. That the good, the pure and undef iled might subsist and continue as the base and foundation of the world, it was essential that from it should ema nate the divine name of eighteen letters, the source and origin of all the benefactions and blessings by which the wor ld is sustained and upheld. \"And God said, let the waters under the heaven be g athered together into one place\" (Gen. i. 9). By th e term waters is also meant the ten sephiroth, kether, hochma, bi na, etc., whose origin is derived from the great Be ing who in himself is both male and female. And who is He? The eternal One, En Soph, the boundless One, from whom hath proceeded all life and breath and all things. The w aters above the firmament designate these sephiroth , who came forth from H the fourth letter in the tetragrammato n, IHVH. In order, however, to arrive at and obtain some conception, though it be inadequate, of En Soph, th rough them, it was necessary that the sephiroth sho uld be arranged and p. 98 posited in a certain order, or sequential series an d relationship18a-18b to each other, and thus becom e a reflected image of the Eternal. This then is the meaning of t he words \"into one place,\" i. e, that by the union of the sephiroth we might be able to ascend to the supreme point of origin, the Eternal One, as saith the scripture, \"J ehovah is One and his name One.\"Zech 14:9 One above and One below ; above, the unity of the boundless One in whose es sence is contained and concentrated all celestial and terres trial existence; One below, yet the same unity need ing the intermediary of the sephiroth in order to be appreh ended and conceived of. When this takes place, it i s perceived that there are not two gods, but one God; one in unity o f essence, above all and in all. The visible reflec tion of the divine unity is referred to in scripture as follows: \"I sa w also the Lord sitting upon a throne\" (Is. vi. 1), and, \"they saw the God of Israel\" (Ex. xxiv. 10), \"The glory of the Lo rd appeared\" (Num. xiv. 10), \"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appea rance of the brightness around about\" (Ex. i. 28). This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . That is, as the light of the rainbow, though refr acted into different colors, is one and the same, so the divin e light and splendor, though refracted and reflecte d by the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"sephiroth, is only one and the same. This mystery i s also contained in the words: \"Let the dry land ap pear\" (Gen. i. 9), for by the word yabash (earth or dry land) is signified the eternal One, the life of the world, from whom come forth all creatures and existences, as from the ear th spring forth all flowers, fruits and seeds. Furt hermore, by the words \"I do set my bow in the cloud\" (Gen. ix. 14), is denoted and symbolized the sephiroth called Mal cuth (kingdom ), since \"I have established it from the c reation of the world.\" Reverting to the conflict be tween the primal elements of light and darkness, it is written, \"Rac hel travailed and she had hard labor\" (Gen. xxxv., 16), the esoteric meaning of which is this: When conflict commenced, the angel Michael took up a position on the right o f Kether, the supreme sephiroth, Raphael on the left and Gabr iel in the front, thus giving rise to the three dif ferent colors. So is the divine glory surrounded with circles of colo rs which are but reflections of it and connoted by the three words, Jehovah , Alohenu , Jehovah ,Deut. 6:4 appellations of the divine One who, conc ealed and invisible to human vision, is but One, as are the colors of the rainbow; and w hose unity is expressed in the verse: \"Blessed be t he name of his glorious and everlasting kingdom.\" p. 99 [paragraph continues] The beauty of the three colors in the verse: \"Hear ! oh, Israel, the Lord our God is one God\" (Deut. vi. 4). The lower is copy or pattern of the higher. The unity above is expressed by a verse con taining six words. Shema Israel, Jehovah, Alohenu, Jehovah, Ach ad.18b (Hear, Israel, Jehovah our God, Jehovah is o ne); the unity below, by the verse Mi, mdd, beshahuloi mim. \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand\" (Is. xl. 12), both referring to one Being, the transcend ently glorious equilibrator or adjustor, creator of the world, IHVH. Kadosh! Kadosh! Kadosh! (Holy! Holy! Holy!) \"Let th e waters be gathered together,\" or as it may be ren dered: \"let the waters become equilibrated and blended harmonio usly together, then will the earth become filled wi th the glory of God and then will the dry land appear,\" i.e., th e mystery of the divine unity expressed in the occu lt formula imparted to and made known only to initiated studen ts and adepts of the secret doctrine, CHUZU BMUCHSO CHUZU. And God said: \"Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed\" (Gen. i. 11). When the waters had been thus brought into one place, or when the strife of the c ontending elements had subsided and ceased, then be gan the work of generation and procreation resulting in the appe arance of created beings innumerable, delighting in the service of their Lord. This is expressed in the words: \"He cau sed the grass to grow for the cattle\" (Ps. civ. 14) on a thousand hills, for whose sustenance it shoots forth daily. By the word chatzir (grass) is denoted those angeli c beings appointed and ordained to administer to the necessi ties of cattle and supply them with food. \"And herb for the service of man\" designates and refers to the minist ering angels called Ophanim, Hayoth and Cherubim, w hose special and peculiar mission and service is to aid and assist in the celebration of sacrifices and wor ship of the Creator, which constitutes the true service of man. Included under the sane terms are those spiritual beings whose study it is to supply the needs of those whose work s are good and their worship acceptable to the divi ne Being, and also to look after their means and sustenance, as i t is written: \"To bring forth food out of the earth ,\" which connotes the herb seeding seed (not seed of the grass) for t he good and welfare of the world. All these various orders of spiritual beings by the divine prevision have been delegated for the service of humanity, that it may enjoy the greatest benefactions and blessings from on high. p. 100 \"And the fruit tree yielding fruit\" (Gen. i. 11). T he word18b-19a fruit here repeated twice indicates the male and female sexes, for as one tree is fructified by anot her tree, so is the female made prolific by the mal e. Who amongst these angels then were male and female! They are th ose called cherubim and thimroth. Who and what are the thimroth? They are angelic beings who are present i n the incense of burnt offerings and are therefore called thimroth aschan (columns of smoke) and are thus helpers to m an in his worship. \"Yielding fruit,\" that is to say , angels in male and female forms resembling human beings with this special difference, they are of majestic form and n oble countenance, whilst the cherubim are smaller in sta ture and of frailer build. Scripture saith of them, \"they have the figure of a man,\" which is the synthesis of all fig ures and forms, because bearing the impress of the Holy Name whose four letters correspond to and symbolize the four quarters of the world, North, South, East and West. Michael is stationed at the north and the faces of all the angelic hosts are directed towards him as being the ir chief. Scripture further states, they have the forms of a man, a lio n, an ox and an eagle. By the face of a man is mean t the face of the male and female blended into one. This form of the human figure is that which is graven on the heavenl y chariot 1 surrounded with myriads of angelic beings, as it is written: \"The chariot of God is encompassed about with thousands upon thousands of shinan (angelic beings) \" (Ps. lxviii. 18), by which word is meant the four differing figures and features of the angels. The first lette r of it, Sh, is the initial of the word shor or ox; the second letter, N, is the initial of nesher, an eagle; whilst the third l etter, A, is the initial of aryeh, a lion; and the fourth letter is N, final; thus symbolizing the form of a man that stands erec t and is always understood to include both the male and female figure. All the myriads upon myriads of angelic bei ngs spoken of by"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"p. 101 the Psalmist derive their particular forms from the mystery expressed by the Psalmist, each according to their group. Yet notwithstanding their diversity of form they ha ve all one common character, so that whether they b ear the form of the ox, eagle or lion, they all exhibit the trai t of the human which is synthesized by the four sac red names graven and imprinted on the divine chariot. Those with the figure of an ox are endowed with special power whi ch is called el (power). Those with the form of au eagle, with t hat degree of grandeur called gaddol (greatness); t hose with a lion's form, that degree of strength called ghibor (strength). As the supreme He, in the likeness of a man, regards them all, they look to Him and receive an impress, peculiar and belonging to man only, and called nora (fear) and which inspires the animals with a feeling of terror and fright. All these angelic forms thus synthesiz ed in the human form reflect its traits and features, as it is writ ten, \"they had the face of a man\" (Ez. i. 10). For this reason the Holy One (blessed be He) is called powerful, great, migh ty and terrible, which four names are symbolized by the four letters of the tetragrammaton, IHVH, which includes all names.19a These four forms are graven on the divine chariot, thus: on the right side, the face of a man; on the left, that of an eagle; on the front, of a lion; and behind, of an o x. These forms are likewise graven on the four quar ters of the world. Like a great branched tree laden with fruit, the divine chariot marked with these forms sends f orth all souls which are the seeds or germs of life to the world, as is implied in the words: \"The herb yielding seed \" (Gen. i. 11), that is, angels called \"herb\" who cast their seed i nto the world from which come human creatures. \"Fru it tree bearing fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself.\" Thes e words designate the man who conserves his seed to advantage. \"Upon the earth\" refer to him who lives a dissipate d life, the which is therefore unlawful and forbidd en. The angelic beings symbolized by the word grass are not fruitfu l, having no seed, and therefore vanish and fade aw ay as they have not the signature of any of the letters of the divine name and become consumed by the primal fire out of which they came forth. Human beings possess not the same stability and end urance of form as the higher angels in their classe s, who have no need of a material covering which a man wears as long as his soul is bound and attached thereto. At night when man sleeps, his soul, quitting the body, ascends in to the region of \"the consuming p. 102 fire\" 2 and returns thence at the moment of waking refresh ed and strengthened, and enters again into the body . The reason of this is, that his soul has not the same p owers of endurance and stability as higher and more exalted spiritual beings. To these refreshed souls the scri pture alludes. \"They are new (or rather renewed) every morning \" and further adds, \"great is thy faithfulness\" (Lam. iii. 23), the import of which is that the divine f aithfulness19a-19b is as illimitable as his goodness and like a mighty ocean into which all rivers and streams flow, yet it is not full, and which also sendeth them forth again to the place fr om whence they came. Eccl. 1:7 Oh! truly great is t he beneficence and faithfulness of the divine Being wh o draweth up the souls of men into the great purify ing fire and flame of his love and returneth them again and agai n until they have accomplished their destiny--final union with Himself. \"And God saw everything that it was good\" (Gen. i. 13), because on the third day of creation harmony a nd peace between all contending elements and forces generall y prevailed, which beholding, the sons of the morni ng or the first born children of light, the angels on high, s ang their joyous song of \"peace and concord through out the universe.\" Only on this great day, is the word \" vayomer \" (and God said) repeated twice, an occult word con taining the mystery of the twelve transformations of the le tters of the sacred name IHVH, symbolizing the four cherubic forms graven on the divine chariot. Footnotes 100:1 By this expression Is meant the divine humanity wh ose transcendent glory, majesty and splendor are be yond the powers of human comprehension and language to e xpress. He is the Augoeides of the Platonists. By t heologians and in Christian creeds, he is called the Unigenitu s, Light of light. very find of very god, begotten, not made, the brightness and reflection of the great divine Fathe r of Light and love and the express image of his pe rson. In Kabbalistic philosophy, he is termed the heavenly m an, Adam Kadmon, Merkava (the chariot). Few are the y who have enjoyed the high privilege of beholding him. I t is only the pure is heart that see him, and that only occasionally. The glory surrounding him is too overwhelming for h uman eyes to behold An ancient seer and prophet. Ez echiel, says: \"And when I saw it, I fell upon my face.\" Ano ther equally Illustrious seer relates: \"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet, as dead. And he laid his right hand up on me, saying unto me, 'Fear not; I am the first an d the last.'\" Another says of him: \"To Him every knee shall bow a nd every tongue shall confess that He most reign un til all things become subject to Him, and then will He deli ver up His Kingdom to the Father, and God shall be All and in all.\""},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"102:2 This expression is not to be taken in the vulgar a nd material sense as is common in Christendom. It I s rather to be considered as the great alchemical fire that tra nsmutes the baser metals into silver and gold, or, in other words, that by its action upon our lower self, changes our evil and defiled human nature so that it becomes l ike unto the divine nature. It is described in the words of the great and saintly mediaeval Kabbalist, Count Pious do Mirandola: \"There is the element of fire in the material world , the sun is the fire of heaven, and in the superse nsual world is the fire of the divine Intelligence.\" The elementary fi re burns, the heavenly fire vivifies, the Divine lo ves, that is, makes us lovable and loving so that we become, as one exp resseth it, partakers of the divine nature. Happy a nd blessed is our destiny, the destiny of every created human sou l. Next: Chapter III. p. 103 AND God said \"Let there be light\" (Gen. i.14); the word19b meoroth (lights) is defective in the Hebrew , being written without vau and therefore is it that offspr ing suffer from epilepsy and similar complaints. Wh en the primal light was as yet invisible or unmanifest, a qalepha 1 (sheath or covering) formed itself around it, whic h, becoming enlarged, produced a second that extended itself to \" little form \" 2 with which it wished to be united and bear its for m permanently. The Holy One dismissed and sent it bel ow. When he created Adam in order that the \"little form\" might appear in the world, the qalepha, seeing Eve was co njoined with Adam, flew towards the paradise above desiring, as at first, to be joined with and form part of \"littl e form,\" but the angel watchers on high would not a llow her to enter and the holy One, having rebuked her, cast her into the depths of the vast abyss of space. When Adam s inned, however, she was permitted to ascend thereout and a llowed to have power and influence over the offspri ng of \"little form,\" who are punishable for the actions of their progenitors. Thus she goes throughout the world. Wh en she dune to the gate of the earthly paradise and saw it guar ded by cherubim, she seated herself next to the one that wielded the flaming sword, but, on observing its threatening at titude towards her, fled back to the world and find ing these little ones as just described, killed them when the moon w as on the wane. This is wherefore the word meoroth (lights) is, as has p. 104 been stated, defective. Until the birth of Cain too k place, she was unable to get near Adam, but event ually succeeding in doing so, she brought forth evil offs pring and flying or winged demons. This association with Adam continued a hundred and thirty years until the coming of Naamah, by whose g reat beauty Aza and Azael, sons of God, were seduced and fell from their high state of light and purity. Fr om them came forth a brood of evil spirits into the world. Naama h it is who wandereth through the world at night ti me, causing men to lose their virility, and wherever they are found sleeping alone in a house she acquires power over them, especially in times of physical weakness and ill health, whils t the moon is waning. When, however, the moon is in creasing, the letters of the word meoroth are changed into the te rm imrath (the word), as it is written: \"Imrath Jeh ovah, the word of the Lord, is refined\" (Ps. xviii. 30) as gold tr ied in the fire. \"He is a shield and buckler to all them that put their trust on him,\" a buckler and shield against evil an d malignant spirits who roam and fly about in the w orld during the decadence of the moon, to such as those whose trust is in the Holy One. When King Solomon went down into the garden of nuts , as saith the scripture: \"I went down into the gar den of nuts\" (Cant. vi. 11) he took up a nutshell, that gave ris e to reflections and ideas that enabled him to unde rstand the reason and cause why anything that is pure and holy become s environed by what is evil, as the nut enclosed wi thin a shell. He perceived that evil spirits attach themselves to the pure and good, environing them similar to shel ls by exciting and producing certain kinds of pleasing emotions an d feelings, the tending of which is to defile and c orrupt, as it is written: \"The pleasures of man produce and bring fo rth evil spirits\" (sadah and sadoth) (Eccle. ii. 8) which occurs during the hours of sleep. It was necessary that th e Holy One should create them in the world in order that it might be complete. The universe as a whole is a system of worlds, enve loping the other from the lowest to the highest, fr om the most material to the highly spiritual, from the darkest and most dense to the most luminous and ethereal, a ll is a scale of graduated worlds of being and existence, and theref ore the saying: \"as above so below, and as below so above.\" Each world is a garment or envelope to the next in sequence. From the primal point of light issue fort h luminous rays which extend through and pervade all the separ ate encircling worlds of existence, converting them into p. 105 palaces of the great king, the splendor, beauty and magnificence of which are beyond description, and, as with these worlds rising in their order one above the other, s o is it with regard to the human form, which in its grace and beauty of contour is the highest expression and approximat e image of the divine, more than all other physical forms below it in the scale of being. All this is in accordance with the divine plan of creation, man himself bein g a microcosm or"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"miniature of the universe, and composed of a series of coverings or envelopes, one within the other, a s spirit, astral form and physical body. As long as the substance of the moon was conjoined with that of the sun, it sh one with its own light, but becoming separated and disjoined fro m it and independent, it reflected a diminished lum inosity and became itself enveloped with zones of decreasing li ght, so that we may now understand why the scriptur e saith: \"Let there be lights,\" using the defective word meoroth, by which is designated occultly the zones or plane s of existence of varying degrees of light which encircle each sta r and planet in the universe, as also this, our ear th, through whose circumambient envelopes of more ethereal substance the primal life-giving light is reflected, and thus differentiated and adapted to become a blessing to man and every a nimate and inanimate creature. \"And God made two great lights\" (Gen. i. 16). The H ebrew word vayas, \"and he made,\" refers to the crea tion as a whole, everything in its kind being subject to its law and order. These two great lights were at first joined together and formed one whole and were of equal light, being both of them impressed20a with the two same sacred names, Jehovah and Alhim, though this latter name was as y et manifested only in an occult manner; yet scriptu re calls them both by the word great, in the plural, with the art icle of distinction, hagedolim (the great), because of their absolute identity, each bearing the same mysterious name Mat spats, understood only by students of the secret do ctrine, and which form the two highest of the thirteen degrees of divine mercy and goodness upon which the world i s founded. The moon, unable to rule along with the sun, and fe eling its loss of dignity in becoming disjoined fro m the sun, said: \"Where feedest thou\" (Cant. 1, 7), or \"whence deriv est thou thy light and glory?\" The sun answered and said: \"Where thou restest thyself at midday.\" The light o f the moon was therefore diminished in order that t he light of the sun might be greater and more manifest at noon, and accordingly the scripture further adds, \"that p. 106 [paragraph continues] I may not be as one that turneth aside from follow ing in the path of the flocks.\" Constrained to be similar to the sun, the moon humbled herself, di minished her light at midday, as it is written. \"Go thy way in the footsteps of the flocks\" (Cant. 1, 8). The Holy One said to the moon: \"Go and humble thyself,\" after w hich she lost her own light and now reflects only that of the sun though at first she was the same in rank and digni ty with it, thus intimating occultly that the female can never fulfi l her destiny and discharge her function except in joint union with her husband. The greater light designates Jehovah; the lesser light, Alhim; the one being a reflection and manifestation of the other as a word is of thought. At first Alhim was expressed by the four letters of the sacred name, or tetragrammaton, but afterwards through manifesting on lower planes of existence, was known and distinguished by this name; yet nevertheless i t radiates its power and glory in all directions in boundless spac e, as the mediator between the known and the Great Unknown, between the spiritual and material, the celestial a nd terrestrial scales and grades of life and existe nce as indicated esoterically by the letter H, which in Alhim conjoi ns Al with im, Al denoting God and im (or yam) the sea as symbol of matter. Thus Alhim becomes the word or Lo gos mediating between the world of pure emanations and the worlds of creation. The former being higher or prio r in existence, is termed the light that rules by d ay, the latter, the light that rules by night. The scripture further states: \"He made the stars al so,\" referring to the countless and innumerable hos ts of angelic and ministering spirits existing in and by him who is t he light and life of the universe, as it is written : \"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon t he earth\" (Gen. i., 17); that is, upon this lower w orld which is a replica or reflection of the world above it, and on the fourth day became illuminated with divine ligh t and termed the Kingdom of David, the Asiatic world of effects, the fourth pillar of the divine throne of glory. This being completed, the four letters of the sacred name became adjusted one to another in their place and position in crea tion. Notwithstanding this, the throne was not completed till the sixth day, when the form of man was create d and all the worlds throughout the realms of space were fixed in their relative orders and position and classed und er the four letters of the divine name, viz., the Atzilatic, Br iatic, Ietziratic and Asiatic worlds. The fourth da y is called in scripture the day rejected by the p. 107 builders, as it is written: \"The stone which the bu ilders rejected\" (Ps. cxviii., 22), and also \"My mo ther's children were angry with me\" (Cant. i., 6), the esoteric mea ning of which is: the light of the moon became dimi nished on that day and the enveloping worlds were established in t heir relative positions around the glittering and r esplendent orbs of light in the firmament, in order to support the throne of David. All these worlds send forth reflections of their li ght upon the earth which they receive from other wo rlds higher and more glorious than themselves, which in their total ity form the Grand Archetypal Man, whose image, all who bear it, are called Man. This is the signification of th e words: \"Ye are men\" (Ez. xxxiv., 21); that is, ye are called by the name of Adam (man). This, however, does not apply t o the idolatrous nations. Every living spirit is th erefore called Adam, for it is a divine emanation of which the bod y is a raiment or covering, as it is further writte n: \"Thou hast clothed me with skin of flesh\" (Job. x., 11), showi ng that the flesh of man is only a garment, and doe s not constitute"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the man. The souls that became incarnated on the ea rth plane in animals are in form similar to the gar ment that covers them, some of them being pure animals as men tioned in scripture, the ox, the sheep, stag, wild goat, giraffe and others. Those souls who have been created and appear as men take upon them the human form and are called human souls, whilst the tens, \"flesh of beast\" signifies that th e soul that has incarnated in this form has the nam e, the qualities and nature of a beast. For instance, the ox is a soul r esiding in an ox form, the flesh being its garment. This same applies to the rest of animals, and as idolatrous nations a re not in scripture called men, so those impure sou ls have nothing in common with the truly human. The bodies of idolatrous people are called impure f lesh, as it is defiled by the soul of which it is t he covering. The body is impure so long as the impure stall resides within it. As soon, however, as the soul quits it, it becomes pure again, being only a shell or covering. The souls of idolaters who incarnate on the earth plane take up on them the forms of unclean animals, such as the camel, swine, coney, and others. It is for this reason that anim als have been distinguished into two classes, the pure and impure . Each have their peculiar tendencies and natural i nclinations, and gravitate to the source whence they first originate d. p. 108 The heavenly lights suspended in the firmament are types20b-21a and figures of things in the world, as it is written: \"And God placed them in the firmament\" (Gen. i, 17) , the greater light to rule by day, the lesser ligh t to rule by night. By the greater light scripture denotes the m ales who rule by day in that they provide for and l ook after the household and its necessary requirements and needs. On the arrival of night the sway of the female beg ins, as the proper manageress of the household, for, as saith t he scripture: \"She riseth also while it is yet nigh t and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens\" (Pro v. xxxi. 15). She and not he . Thus the light ruling by day signifies the male, or husband; the light ruling by night, the female, or wife. We further read: \"He m ade the stars also.\" When the wife relinquishes domestic cares an d duties in order to attend to her husband, she lea veth the direction of them to her maidens who abide at home to carry on the management, which again reverts to the husband when day begins. \"And God made two lights\"; that of the sun is terme d \"flames of light\" and go upward; that of the moon is termed \"flames of fire\" and descend upon the earth, and ex ercise their power and influence during week days. This is why at the close of the Sabbath, the blessing of the fire is pronounced. \"Blessed art thou, Oh Lord, who has created the flames of fire,\" for then its rule and influence be gins again. The fingers of the hand are occult symb ols of a deep spiritual mystery the back of them being furnished with nails. It is therefore lawful to regard and fi x attention on them at the close of the Sabbath, for the light of the fire whose rule begins at that moment is repres ented by the exterior part of the fingers, whilst the flame of l ight that comes from above must only be meditated u pon by regarding the interior part of the fingers to which it corresponds. This mystery is expressed in Scrip ture thus: \"Thou shalt see my back part, but my face shalt thou not see\" (Ex. xxxiii. 23). Therefore a man should not r egard and meditate upon the interior part of the hand at the close of the Sabbath when he repeats the prayer end ing with the words: \"Who hast created the flame of fire.\" The wo rds \"Thou shalt see my back part\" refer to the back of the fingers symbolizing the light that rules and prevai ls during week days. \"My face shalt thou not see,\" to the front part, the \"flames of light,\" which rule during the Sabbat h. on which day the Holy One himself presides over the invisible hosts of spirits surrounding his throne of glory, w ho are under his special p. 109 charge. Therefore, on the Sabbath, rest from toil a nd labor is granted to all the worlds. The holy nat ion is the only one upon the earth that inherits and enjoys this he ritage of the \"flames of light\" proceeding from the primal light and manifested only on the Sabbath day, and from which also emanate all the lesser lights that prevail bel ow. At the departure of the Sabbath these \"flames of light\" be come invisible, but the flames of fire, each of the m in their appointed place and manner, rule and prevail during the week days. For this reason the nails of the fi ngers should be only regarded and meditated on by the glare of a fi re. It is written: \"And the living creatures (hayoth) r an and returned as flashing flames of light\" (Ez. i . 14). No human eye is able to view these angels going to and fro. They are the angels of \"The Wheel,\"21a the occult m eaning of which is this: Metatron is the chief and highest am ong the angels. Above him at a distance of five hun dred leagues are those hayoth, or living moving creatures, whose flight through the realms of space is so rapid as to be indistinguishable to mortal eye; they are concealed beneath the two supreme letters of the divine name , Y and H, which rule and dominate the two remaining letters, V and H, that form their chariot. The great mysteri ous, the Unknowable, ruleth over all these hayoth, of whom t hose that are invisible rule over those that are vi sible and reflect their light end glory down upon them. All these liv ing creatures are placed n the firmament of heaven, and respecting them it is written: \"Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven\" (Gen. i. 14), that is, let the living creatures called hayoth be in the region called the firmament of heaven. Above and beyond them, howeve r, is"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"another heaven as it is written: \"And the likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living crea tures was as the color of the terrible crystal\" (Ez. i. 22). It was the higher firmament of heaven whose glory a nd magnificent splendor (like that of the starry mi st of the Milky Way, which includes within its dim and remote recesses innumerable and countless worlds of ineff able brilliancy and beauty) dawned upon the prophet's vi sion, and there it exists a universe of light and l ove hidden and concealed from mortal gaze like the thought of the Divine Mind, ineffable, transcending all human comp rehension and powers of conception. As man has never been abl e to divine and understand the nature of thought, m uch less can he gauge the thoughts of Ain Soph (who is as a mighty ocean in which all thought is drowned) the I nfinite p. 110 and Boundless One, the concealed of all concealment s, without beginning and without end, the great inv isible center and fount of all life and motion existent in worlds known and unknown, careering in their mighty orbit s in the fathomless abysses of space, the Great Being the sm allest portion of whose glory and might and majesty is reflected and seen in sun and moon and the splendid galaxies of stars and constellations, all glittering and fla shing in a midnight sky, and in the mystic music of the sphere s are forever singing as they shine: \"The hand that made us is divine.\" In the present world of shadows and uncertainties, man must have wandered and lived ignorant, uninstru cted and unenlightened, unable to acquire the faintest glimm er or notion of the mind and nature of the Divine B eing but for the intermediation of the Logos21a or Word that, op erating through the sephiroth kether (crown) produc ed the letters of the alphabet which, in their forms, simple and m ultiplex, are symbols of spiritual ideas by means o f which we obtain conceptions, though inadequate, defective an d incomplete, of Him in whom we live and move and h ave our being. The letter aleph symbolizes the beginning and the e nd. Throughout the universe, all classes of beings are impressed with its signature, both those in heaven and those on earth. Though it includes many forms, yet they a re but one full letter. By the higher part of it is symbolized the divine mind and thought, as also the upper firmamen t of the spiritual world. Beneath it and in the middle of aleph is the letter vau, the numerical value of which is six, d enoting the six degrees between the Supreme Mind and the firmament above the hayoth, or \"the hidden living creatures.\" The light emanating from the Divine is expressed in the word \"brashith,\" of which the first part, bra, contains the initial letters of the name Abraham, to which scripture refers: \"An d the Lord appeared to Abraham as he sat at the doo r of his tent in the heat of the day\" (Gen. xviii. 1), the esoter ic meaning of which is as follows: When Abraham sat at the door of his tent; that is, at the gate separating the highe r and lower world, symbolized by the letter aleph, he felt the great heat of the day; that is, he became mentally and sp iritually enlightened by the divine light of the Fi rst Logos. The light of the Second Logos was beheld by Isaac w hen, in the cool of the evening and the sun was goi ng down, he prayed for the coming of this light, as it is writt en: \"And Isaac went p. 111 out to meditate in the field at eventide\" (Gen. xxi v. 63). It was21b then he foresaw the contention th at would arise between Jacob and Esau. The light of the Third Logos, that proceeds from th e other two, was that seen by Jacob, as it is writt en: \"And as he passed, peniel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh\" (Gen. xxxiii. 31). At eventide he b eheld the light called and known as the Netzach of Israel (victory of Israel), and he halted on his thigh, because thi s light of sephirothic origin constitutes the thigh in the sep hirothic figure. His thigh, not thighs, for as just said, he beheld the light of netzach, which is only' of the fourth degr ee. For this reason, after Jacob no one was endowed wit h the gift of prophecy until the coming of Samuel, as scripture states: \"The netzach, the strength or victory of Is rael\" (1 Sam. xv. 29). \"And he touched the sinew of his thigh.\" When the angel of Esau who struggled with Jacob saw he could not prevail against him because he derive d his power and strength from the two first sephirothic d egrees or emanations; that is, from the supreme lig ht and that called Adam Kadmon, the archetypal man, he touched the sinew of his thigh in which was contained the f orce symbolized by netzach (denoting firmness, inflexibi lity), and from that time as we have observed, prop hecy was not found in Israel until the coming of Samuel, when it is said: \"The netzach or strength of Israel is not a man\"; that is to say, comes not from that sephirothic degree called man, but from that named netzach. Joshua indeed pro phesied but only in an inferior manner because of his intimate and close association with Moses, as it is written: \"And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him\" (Num. xxvii. 20). This was the case with David, as he says: \"At thy right hand are the pleasures of Netzach\" (Ps. xvi. 11). Not in but at thy right hand, that is netzach.

The psalmist, speaking of man, says \"thou hast made him 'littler' than the angels, that is, in form an d mind.\" Next: Chapter IV. p. 112 WHY was the thigh of Jacob weakened? Because impuri ty attacks a man on his left side and deprives him of his power and strength, and this state of weakness prev ailed till the coming of Samuel, who reminded the p eople that netzach was the light of Jacob, the netzach that tr iumphs in Israel. This also is why the Prophecies o f Samuel during his lifetime were denunciations of wrath and judgme nt. Furthermore, the Holy One endowed Samuel afterw ards with the sephirothic power called hod. When? After he had anointed Saul and David as kings, which made him the equal of Moses and Aaron who rejoiced, the one in N etzach, the other in Hod. All the sephiroth are bound together in orderly seq uence as it is written: \"Moses and Aaron were his p riests and Samuel amongst those that call upon his name\" (Ps. xl. 6). All are united and joined the one to the ot her, as were Jacob, Moses and Joseph. At first Jacob was lord of the house, then after his death Moses took possess ion. Joseph only ruled it during his life and that through Jaco b his father. When he died Moses then ruled, for wh en the Divine Presence went out of Egypt, Moses became joined to Joseph, as it is said: \"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him\" (Ex. xiii. 19).21b-22a Why is it said, \" with him? \" Because as a man cannot enjoy the female except t hrough means of a body, so with the body of Joseph as a link, Moses became united with the Schekina, which thus in a manner of speaking ha d three husbands, being united at first with Jacob, then Jo seph and Moses. Jacob died, and his body was buried in the holy land. Joseph died, but his body was not buried ther e, only his bones. Moses died, but neither his bone s nor his body were interred in the holy land. After his death, th e Schekina entered into Palestine and returned to h er p. 113 first husband, Jacob. From this we infer that a wom an twice married after her decease becomes joined t o and cohabits with her first husband. Moses entered not into Palestine, yet was he more favored than Jacob, who became joined to the Schekina on high after death, whilst Moses was honored by her presence with h in earth l ife. If it is said the pre-eminence is with Jacob, it is not so, becau se when the children of Israel went forth out of Eg ypt, they were subjects of Jubilee, the lowest stage of knowledge leading to divine wisdom and knowledge, and therefo re wandered they in the wilderness, being unable to enter into Palestine. Their children, however, entered in, bec ause they were children of the Schekina. During life Moses lived w ith her and followed her commands, but when he depa rted out of the world he ascended to the mount of the Holy Spir it, and through it to Jubilee on high where were ga thered the six hundred thousand souls that along with him had come out of Egypt. With Jacob this was not the case.22a He, through the spirit, attained to that degree in the divine life termed Shemita , corresponding to the period of demission in connection with the year of Jubilee. He did not enjoy communion with the Schekina in his lifetime b ecause he had to concern himself too much with the cares of his h ousehold. The holy land could only be gained and en tered by divine aid and assistance. This is why those who ar e spiritually minded only become united with the Di vine, whilst those engrossed with the cares, duties and anxietie s of married life are only partially so. The life o f the former is spiritual, that of the latter is carnal and worldly . There can be no point of union, no association wi th one another. Between those who died in the wilderness and those who entered into the promised land is only a physic al resemblance. Those who died in the wilderness attai ned to that degree of spirituality which enable the m to behold the Divine in all his wondrous works and marvellous doing with their own eyes, whilst those who entere d into the Promised Land and had lived in the wilderness were worldly minded and thus unqualified for the attainm ent of spiritual light and life. Jacob, whilst he lived, w as attached to his wives, but after death his spiri t became united with the Divine. Moses separated himself from his wife a nd attached himself to the Divine whilst in the bod y, and after death became united with the great mysterious Being who is above all and in all. All the separate grades and degrees of spiritual li fe form p. 114 one great and vast whole. The soul of Moses belongs to that called Jubilee, his body to Shemita . The soul of Jacob belonged to Shemita, his body to his wives. All the se celestial degrees of light have their types on t he earth plane and are suspended and posited or placed in the firm ament.

And God said: \"Let us make man\" (Gen. i. 26). \"The secret of the Lord, that is, the secret of the divi ne life, is with them that fear him.\"Ps. 35:14 Rabbi Simeon was sitting surrounded by his students and meditating on these words when suddenly a voic e audible only to himself cried \"Simeon! Simeon!\"22a what sig nify these words \"Let us make man?\" Who was he that spake thus to Alhim? It was the voice of the great celest ial Being known as the Aged of the Aged who, making himself visible for a moment and speaking these words to Ra bbi Simeon, disappeared then from view and was seen no more. Divining from the exclamation Simeon! Simeon! and n ot Rabbi! who it was that had addressed him, Rabbi Simeon turned to the students and made known to them who a nd what he had just seen and heard. \"It is evident,\" said he, \"that the Holy One whom t he scriptures describe as The Ancient of Days (Dan. vii. 9) has just spoken and now is the time to unfold and make known a profound mystery which up to the present ha s never been divulged and revealed to mortal man.\" Pausing a moment as one enraptured and overwhelmed, and filled by the sudden influx of a great invisib le spiritual force and power, the students gazing in breathless silence and speechless wonderment, in low and solem n tones Rabbi Simeon spake again. \"In ages long gone by lived a great and powerful ki ng whose design it was to build palaces wherein to dwell and live in a manner becoming his royal grandeur. In his ret inue of servants and attendants was found an archit ect, of great abilities and lofty genius in the art and science o f construction, who made it the chief aim of his li fe to acquaint himself with the plans and ideas of his monarch and carry thorn into execution and doing nothing excep t by his authority and command. The king was the Divine Being personified in script ure as p. 115 heavenly Wisdom. Alhim was the celestial architect personified22a-22b as \"the heavenly Mother.\" Alhim was also the architect of the world below and was designated and known as the Schekina, and as a woman is not a llowed to do anything without the consent and against the wis h and will of her husband, all the palaces have bee n built by emanation. The father, through the Logos or Word, s aid to the mother: \"Let this be done!\" and it was d one at once, as it is written: \"And God said let there be light and light was,\" that is, the Logos said to Alhim, t he creative Logos, \"let there be light.\" The master or lord of the pal ace speaks and the architect forthwith executes and thus were all the palaces or worlds made and produced by emanations, as, \"let there be a firmament,\" \"let, there be ligh ts in the firmament,\" all were done on the moment. Regarding the present world, the world of separation, that is to say where all things appear to be independent of each other, the architect said to the master of the palaces: \"L et us make man in our image and after our likeness.\" Certainly replie d the master, it will be good to make him, but he w ill surely transgress and commit wrong against thee, in that h e will be ignorant and foolish, as it is written: \" A wise son is the joy of his father, but a foolish son is the heavine ss of his mother\" (Prov. x. 1). A wise son denotes man who came forth by emanation, a foolish son, created man.\" Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking as all the students be fore him rose up and cried: Rabbi! Rabbi! Master! M aster! Was there then a division between the Father and the Mo ther whether man should come forth from the father by emanation or from the mother by creation? No, replied Rabbi Simeon, because man by emanation is male and female as he proceeds from the father a nd mother conjoined, as it is written: \"And God said let ther e be light and light was.\" \"Let there be light\" con notes the part of man that emanated from the father; that is, the mal e principle; \"and light was,\" refers to that part t hat emanated from the mother, the female principle. Man therefore was created androgynous with two faces. The emanative man possessed no special form or likeness, but the heav enly mother it was who wished to produce and provid e the created man with a special image. Now the two light s emanating from the father and mother, called in s cripture, light and darkness, the form of created man must of necessity be compounded from the active light proc eeding from the father, and the passive light (termed darkness) that proceeded p. 116 from the mother. As, however, the father had said t o the mother that the emanated man if placed in the world would through frailty transgress and sin, he refused to t ake part in the formation of a human form for him. For this reason the light created on the first day was concealed an d hidden and treasured up by the Holy One for the r ighteous, as also the darkness was created and reserved at the s ame time for the evil and wicked, as it is written: \"The wicked shall be silent in darkness\" (I Sam. ii. 9). And it was also on account of this darkness that man woul d, as foreseen, sin against the light, the father was unwilling to take part in the creation of man below on the earth plane.22b This also is why the mother said: \"Let us make man in ou r image,\" that is of light, \"and in our likeness,\" of passive light or darkness (which as has been stated is a material ized allotrophic form of light itself), which serve s as a garment of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the light as the body serves as a covering for the soul, as it is written: \"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh\" (Job x. ii). As Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking for a moment, the s tudents, one and all, pleased and delighted with th eir master's teaching, exclaimed: \"Happy oh Master is our lot, i n that we have had the privilege of hearing and lis tening to teachings that have never been delivered and impart ed to anyone until now.\" Resuming his discourse, Rabbi Simeon spake and said : \"See now! that I even I am He and there is no Alh im with me\" (Deuter. xxxii. 39). Give attention, oh student s, to the expositions I am about to give of teachin gs handed down from ancient masters which I am permitted to impart and make known to you. Who was he that gave expres sion to the words: \"Behold I even I am He\"' It was the Supr eme Being, the Highest of the high, the Cause of al l causes. the one and only originator of the universe, without wh om nothing was made that was made, in heaven above or on earth below, as we have already expounded in our re marks on the words: \"Let us make man.\" From the plu ral form of this expression, we perceive that in the divine essence there are two hypostatic beings or Logoi wh o speak the one to the other at this moment. The second said to the first: \"Let us make man\" because it did nothing fr om itself, but by the permission of the first. He it is who said: \"Be hold I even I am He and there was no Alhim with Me\" ; that is, there was no Alhim with whom I consulted and took counsel , therefore, the logical conclusion is that Alhim w ho said \"Let us make man\" was a hypostatical Logos made for the creation of man. p. 117 Master! cried the students as they stood up. pardon our interrupting thee, but hast thou not said that the Cause of all22b-23a causes said to the first hypostatic bein g or Logos, called Kether (Crown), \"Let us make man .\" Then answered Rabbi Simeon and said, note well the explanation I am about to give unto you. I have not said that He who is Cause of all causes is the same as the Al him, or that He is not the same. In the divine esse nce there is no conjunction of persons or natures whatever as commo nly understood. What conjunction there is in the di vine essence is similar to that which exists in the male and female principles which are as one, as it is w ritten: \"For I called them one\" (Is. li. 2). Because in the divine essence there is no multiplicity nor conjunction, therefore is it that God said: \"Behold I even I am He and no Alhim is wi th me\"; that is, I am Alhim and Alhim is I. Then rose up all the students and bowed themselves before their master, Rabbi Simeon, and said: Happy and blessed is the man whom his Lord hath chosen and permitted to reveal and make known mysteries that have never been divulged even to the angels themselves. Rabbi Simeon continuing his discourse spake and sai d: We must bring to a close the interpretation of t he esoteric meaning of this most mysterious part of scripture. It is further added: \"I kill and make alive, I woun d and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my han d\" (Deuter. xxxii. 39). The words \"I kill and make alive\" have reference to the sephiroth found on the right hand of the sephirothic tree of life, viz., hochma (wisd om), chesed (grace), and netzach (victory); those on the left h and being binah, (understanding), geburah (justice) , hod (glory). From the former proceed principles conducive to lif e, from the latter those that tend and converge to death. If these pairs of opposites had not been united by the media ting sephiroth, viz., tiphereth (beauty), yesod (fo undation), and malkuth (kingdom), there could not have been any eq uilibrium of principles in the world, no balance of justice, inasmuch as every perfect tribunal consists of thre e judges who in their official capacity and jurisdi ction are considered as one. When the three Logoi constitute themselves as a tribunal for the dispensation of ri ght and justice, the right hand is extended to receive penitents and on the sephirothic tree this hand, termed the Sche kina, the right hand of God, is associated with chesed (grace or me rcy). The left hand is associated with the sephirot h geburah (justice). p. 118 [paragraph continues] The hand called on the above mentioned three, Jeho vah or Schekina, corresponds to the mediating sephiroth, tiphereth (beauty, etc.), so t hat when a man repents of his sins and wrongdoings, this hand is outstretched to save him from the exacting justice and severity of the tribunal; but when the Cause of all causes judges,23a then as scripture states, \"there is none that can deliver out of my hands.\" Still further, in this verse, the word I (ani) is repeated three times and thus there are three alephs, a, a, a, and three yods, i, i, i which letters form part of the tetragrammaton, or Sacred Name, written in full. The verse also contains three vaus (v-aha yeh, v-ani, v- en) that are also found in the divine name. The mas ters have explained the occurrence of the word Alhi m in this verse as meaning Alhim acherim , other, that is, false Gods. According to this vie w the interpretation of it is this. \"Behold I, even I, the Holy One am He, or I am the Schekina and Alhim is not with me; that is, the dem ons Samuel (prince of darkness) and Nachash (serpent) are not with me. I kill and make alive by the Schekina; I d estroy the guilty and unrepentant and I make to live him that is just and upright; and there is none who can deli ver out of my hands; that is, from the hands of Jehovah, from the three Logoi whose essence is denoted by and concea led in the fourteen letters of the mysterious word Chuza Bmuch so Chuza.

Though differing in th eir relationship to the great center and source of Life and Light, yet are they each of them mirrors of the glory and beauty, the splendor and power, the might and majes ty of the divine attributes and reflections of the Cause of a ll causes, the great Being dwelling in light ineffa ble, in presence of which all other lights become dimmed and disappear as fades and vanishes the darkness before the risin g sun. p. 119 \"Let us make man.\" Another and altogether different interpretation and meaning has been given of these words by the learned of former times, and is as follows: The y apply them as spoken by ministering angels who, e ndowed with a knowledge both of the past, the present and futur e, foresaw that man would fall and therefore they o pposed his creation. Furthermore, at the moment that the Schek ina or creative Logos said to the Holy One: \"Let us make man\" the angels Aza and Azael objected and said: Why cre ate man since thou foreseest that he will sin and b reak thy law, along with the woman who will be formed from the pa ssive light called darkness, as the man from the ac tive light? Then spoke the Schekina and said in reply to them: Through woman, against whom ye object, shall ye you rselves fall and lose your glory and state, as it is writte n: \"And the sons of Alhim23a saw the daughters of m an were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose\" (Gen. vi. 2). Said the students to Rabbi Simeon: Master! were not Aza and Azael correct in saying that man through t he woman would sin and transgress? To this remark Rabbi Simeon replied: It was on this account that the Schekina said unto them: \"Before accusing them ye should see to it that ye are better and str onger and purer than they. Man will fall and sin by one woman alone; ye will fall and be seduced by many. He will repent, but ye will become obdurate and hardened i n your sin.\" Said the students again to Rabbi Simeon, since sexu al desires and impulses were the cause of sin and t ransgression, wherefore do they exist? Said Rabbi Simeon: If the Holy One had not created a spirit of good that emanates from the active ligh t, and spirit of evil that emanates from the passive light or darkne ss, man would have been a neutral ignorant kind of being unable to distinguish and contrast things essential to men tal growth and spiritual development and progress; therefore was he created dual in nature, endowed with sexual feel ings and rational functions, from the right and ord erly discharge of which, or otherwise, he enjoys or suffers, as it is written: \"See I have set before thee this day, life and good, death and evil\" (limiter. xxx. 15). Why then, said the students, was man thus created w ith a power of choosing and determining his future? Would it not have been better to have formed him with no des ires and inclinations except for the just, the true and good, and thus have p. 120 avoided becoming the cause of such disturbance in h eavenly regions? Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: It was necessary that m an23a-23b should be created thus in order that the good law might operate and be an incentive to spiritual prog ress and development. Now the law in its jurisdicti on operates in two ways in the dispensation of justice, promising rewards to the righteous and decreeing punishment t o the guilty and sinful; therefore is it written; \"Verily there is a reward for the righteous and punishment for th e wicked,\" and man must therefore be created and adapted for the r eception of these different effects, viz., rewards and penalties. The Divine Being desires that good should prevail t hroughout the world, as the scripture saith: \"He ha th not created the earth in vain, he formed it to be inhabited\" (I s. xlv. 18). Furthermore, the good law is as it wer e a judicial robe to the Schekina, and if man had been created without m oral tendencies and with an inclination liable to b e diverted to evil as well as good, then would the Schekina have been like a poor man without garb or raiment. He wh o commits sin despoils in a manner the Schekina of its robe a nd incurs punishment and condemnation; as on the ot her hand, he who observes and practices the commandments of the law, is accounted as meritorious as one who arrays the Schekina with a robe or garment. This truth is symb olized by the garment with fringes or borders (zizi th) as it is written: \"For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin when he shall sleep\" (Ex. xxii . 27) referring to the Schekina. When anyone offers up an insincere prayer , destroying angels pursue after it, as saith the s cripture: \"All her persecutors have overtaken her\" (Lam. i. 3), th erefore we pray that \"He being full of compassion, forgiveth our sins and destroys us not utterly\" (Ps. lxxviii. 38) . Next: Chapter V. The King's Palaces "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" THE KING'S PALACES. THE word sin refers to Samuel, who is the serpent; 23b destroys means the destroying angel, his anger, the Holy One who wishes not that these angels should seize h old of our prayers. The destroying angels are under the control of seven chiefs, each having seventy others subject to his orders and authority. These are always read y to seize a man's prayer as it proceeds from his lips, and ther e are myriads of them. When a man with fringed garm ent and phylacteries girded upon his head and arm, uttereth a sincere prayer, scripture saith: \"And all the pe ople of the earth shall see, thou bearest the name of Jehovah and sha ll be afraid of thee\" (Deuter xxviii. 10). As we ha ve before stated, the name of Jehovah is contained in the phy lactery on the head of every suppliant, and when th us seen these destroying angels fly quickly away as it is written : \"A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousa nd at thy right hand\" (Ps. xci. 7). When Jacob by divine clairvoyan ce saw the afflictions and the captivity his descen dants would endure and suffer in the later days, it is said tha t he was greatly afraid and distressed (Gen. xxxii. 7). This was why he divided the people into three companies, as it i s written: \"And he divided the children unto Leah a nd unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids, and he put the handmaid s and their children foremost, Leah and p. 122 her children in the middle and Rachel and Joseph hi ndmost\" (Gen. xxxiii. 1, 2). By these three compani es or divisions were prefigured the three captivities: th e handmaids and their children referring to the cap tivity of Edom or Egypt, Leah and her children, and Rachel with Josep h, to the other two captivities. Foreseeing the anguish and misery that would be end ured by his descendants in the future, this is why he prayed and vowed, saying, \"If God will be with me, and will ke ep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my father 's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my Adonai (Gen. xxviii. 20-21). David also alluded to the captivity of the Schekina, foreseeing the children of Israel returni ng with joy to their fatherland and in the exuberance of his joy, composed ten different songs, the last of which is entitled \"A Prayer of the afflicted one, when overwhelmed, he p oureth out his complaint before the Lord\" (Ps. cii. ). The prayer of the poor and suffering has precedence with the H oly One and is regarded before the prayer of all ot hers. And what is the Poor man's prayer? It is the evening pr ayer which he is privileged to utter when by himsel f and alone. The upright poor man is the descendant of Jacob und er the power of other nations, and resembles the ev ening prayer in that he is in the night of captivity. The prayer of the Sabbath day is a charity or good deed done to the poor, and is as the rising sun that beams upon everything and is a benefit to all. For this reason a man should reg ard himself as a mendicant at the King's gate or door, as humility o f heart and mind should be the chief feature in pra ying during the week days especially when, girded with the phylacte ries, a man stands as a suppliant and mendicant bef ore the palace gates of Adonai, the Great King, and prays: \"Open my lips, Oh Adonai, and my mouth shall show f orth thy praise\" (Ps. li. 17). During week days, an angel li ke an eagle descends as soon as the evening prayer begins and taking it between his wings ascends and presents it then to the Holy One. This ministering angel is called Ouriel (light of G od) when the prayer is an act of piety and love, an d Nouriel (fire of God) when it proceeds from earnestness of heart and feeling which is as a fiery glow coming forth from the soul within, as it is written: \"A fiery stream issued an d came forth\"23b (Dan. vii. 9). During morning pray er, the ministering angel who descends is in form like a li on, and after taking it, ascends again heavenward. During vespers, or evening prayer, the ministering angel is in p. 123 form of an ox and under the rulership of Gabriel.23 b-24a On the Sabbath day the Holy One descends Hims elf from heaven accompanied by the patriarchs, in order to w elcome his only daughter. This is the mystery and o ccult meaning of the word Sabbath, She-Bath, the signific ation of which is, for she is his only child. When the Sabbath dawns, the Holy One descends from his throne of glory to greet its coming, and myriad s of angelic beings assemble and sing their hymn of prai se and adoration: \"Lift up your heads, oh ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shal l come in.\" Who is the King of Glory! The Lord, strong and migh ty; the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads a nd be ye lifted up, ye everlasting door, and the King of glo ry shall come in. Who is the King of Glory? The Lor d of Hosts! He is the King of Glory. (Ps. xxiv. 9.) Then are opene d the gates of the seven palaces, the first of whic h is the palace of love, the second of reverence, the third of mercy, the fourth of the luminous mirror, the fifth of the non-luminous mirror, the sixth of justice, the seventh of judgme nt. These palaces are alluded to in the words Brash ith bra Alhim. (Gen. 1. i.) Brashith divided into Bra-shith signif ies He created six, viz., the six palaces, and Alhi m along with them forms the seventh. Corresponding to them are also s even palaces here below on the earth plane, an allu sion to which is made in the psalm beginning with the words, \"Giv e unto the Lord, oh ye mighty, give unto the Lord g lory and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"strength.\" (Ps. xxix. 1.) In this psalm the words, \"the voice of the Lord,\" are found repeated seven t imes, as also the divine name Jehovah eighteen times, corresponding t o the number of worlds that the Holy One visits, as described in Psalm lxviii. 18. The chariot of God, viz., the div ine form in which He manifests his glory, is surrou nded by tens of thousands and myriads of angels, and in this form o f manifestation He visits the eighteen systems of w orlds in the universe. The gates of the palace whither prayers a scend are strongly guarded, but they find no entran ce unless sincere and the result of meditation, whilst the pa lace of the Shekina or Divine Presence is always op en, and it is of prayers sent up to it that the Psalmist refers. \"Th ey shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies at the gate\" (Ps. cxxvii. 5), that is, the King's gate, or gate of the Divine Shekina, to whom all prayers fr om our Higher Self, or the divine within us, should be addressed direct and without any p. 124 intermediary; because what cometh from the divine, unto the divine returneth, like the Scripture with all its positive and negative commandments24a and precepts which cam e direct from the name of Jehovah, as it is written : \"This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\" (Ex. iii. 15.) The word shemi (my nam e), augmented with the two first letters yod and he (I and H) of the divine name has the numerical value o f 365, equal to the number of negative precepts or prohibitions of the law. Also the word zicri (my memorial). augment ed with i the two last letters of the same name, vau and he (V an d I1), in its numerical value represents the 245 po sitive precepts or commandments of scripture. It is for this reason that the liturgy of the Shema, containing 248 word s, is repeated before the benediction, \"Blessed be thou, Oh Lord, who hast chosen thy people Israel in love.\" Next: Chapter VI. On Israel or the Children of Ligh t ON ISRAEL OR THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. Now the children of Israel are all included and sum med up in the name Abraham, of whom God spoke as \"h is friend,\" and which also applies to Israel, for Isra el is contained in the divine name written in full, IV D, HA, VAV, HA, the numerical value of which is 45, equaling th at of Adam (man). The scripture states that \"He cre ated man (Adam) in his image,\" signifying Israel who existed in the divine thought or mind before the creation of the world, and afterwards was created in the likeness and imag e of God. Offspring, life and the means of subsiste nce proceed from the middle column of the sephirotic tree of li fe, called in scripture, \"My first born, even Israe l\" (Ex. lv. 22), and that nourisheth all the world. The support of Israe l since the destruction of the temple is prayer, wh ich is accepted in lieu of sacrifices. Its cry since the time of the f irst captivity has been: \"Give me children or else I die\" (Gen. xxx. 1). When the Shekina vanished from the temple, the ten sephirotic splendors also departed with it, and, be coming blended and united together they ascended on high a nd surrounded the throne of glory that they might s till continue to receive prayers that go up on high. When man the refore desires that his prayers may ascend to heave n as a sweet and pleasing melody, or when he yearns to break the yoke and bondage of the old serpent who seeks alwa ys to disturb and thwart his prayers, he ought first of a ll to unify himself with the Divine Presence or hea venly Shekina, and use p. 125 it as a sling wherewith to combat against and overc ome his spiritual adversary. This living consciousn ess of the Divine within us and about us it is that endows us with strength and fortitude to tread the path of du ty calm and unperturbed, and thus become better able to accompl ish life's great mission and achieve its greatest v ictory, self conquest, the prelude to the realization of our des tiny, i.e.. union with the Divine. The teachings of Theosophy on this subject of the secret doctrine24a are containe d in the names of the accents used in sacred chanti ng, such as Zarka (a sling), Shophar (a trumpet), Segolta (a bu nch of grapes), etc. Next: Chapter VII. The Prayer of Rabbi Simeon THE PRAYER OF RABBI SIMEON. The students had assembled and waited for the maste r to begin his daily discourse and exposition of th e secret doctrine. Rabbi Simeon, after a few moments of medi tation, prayed and said: \"Oh ye angels on high and ye great teachers of the secret doctrine taught and expounded in the sacred schools above, assemble yourselves and be present to note the word s and their esoteric meaning that I am about to mak e known, and thou, oh Elijah, I conjure by the bond of our b rotherhood, and pray thou mayst be allowed to desce nd and be present whilst I explain the mystery of the great s truggle between good and evil in the world, as also of the conflict"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"between light and darkness that has been, and still is, waged from the beginning; and thou Enoch, grea t angel of the Divine Presence! come thou and be present also, alo ng with the masters of the school over which thou p residest. This I entreat and supplicate not for my own self, but for the honor and glory of the Shekina.\" Then b egan Rabbi Simeon his discourse. \"Oh Zarka,\" he said, \"it is indeed through thee tha t our prayers ascend and reach their destined place on high. As a slinger slings and directs his stones to a certain mark or object, so should we, whilst praying, direc t and address our prayers to the Divine in a manner of which thou art the symbol. Therefore the teachings of our forefat hers instruct us that all our desires should be expressed before the pronunciation and utterance of the divine name, an d by standing up cause them to ascend on high. Prayer should be d irect and uninterrupted by anything p. 126 whatever, even though it be a serpent entwining its elf about our lower limbs, and always addressed to the Infinite One as we have been taught. At the repeating of 'Bl essed be thou, oh Lord,' every knee should be bowed , and never by word or act of inattention should the union betw een himself and the Divine Being be disrupted. The union of the Shekina with its heavenly spouse is sometimes effec ted by passing through six degrees of the lower lim bs of the sephirotic tree. It is for this reason that during prayer, the knees should be bowed and the six joint s of each of the legs may be emblematic of this union, which is some times effected by passing through six degrees of th e arms of the sephirotic tree. Occasionally, the Shekina ascends on high between the father and the mother symbolize d by the letters yod and he. When it ascends it attains to t he highest position, so that, losing sight of it, t he angels themselves ask, \"Where is the place of its glory?\" When it ris es above aleph, it forms and becomes a crown, which is called kether (crown). When, however, the Shekina descends below, it takes the form of a vowel beneath aleph, and then is called nekudah (point), as the crown above is calle d taga in the esoteric science of the accents. When this taga becomes joined to the Shekina,24a-24b the letter za in is formed, a symbol of the union denoted by the seventh shephira, and in its form an emblem of the foundati on stone of the universe. This is why it is written ; \"Thou shalt have a perfect and just stone\" (Deuter. xxv. 15). T here is no musical accent which has not its corresp onding vowel point,--thus segoltha coincides with segol, the acc ent zakeph with seheva. Those who are acquainted wi th the esoteric meaning of the accents will easily find th e correspondents of all the others, such as athnach , munach, etc. Next: Chapter VIII. Previous Worlds and Races PREVIOUS WORLDS AND RACES. \"These (aleh) are the generations (children or race s) of the heavens and the earth\" (Gen. xi., 4). It has been stated that in every passage of Scripture that the word al eh occurs, there is no connection with what precede s it. This is the ease with the passage just quoted. Its logical refe rence and connection is with the words \"tohu,\" and \"bohu\" (without form and void) in the second verse of Gen. i. There are those who say that the Holy One created worlds and then destroyed them. Why were they destroyed? Because, a s the Scripture says, \"the earth was tohu and bohu, \" indicating the state of former worlds before p. 127 their destruction. But would it not have been bette r if he had24b-25a not created them? Most certainly it would, and the explanation involves a great mystery. if you as k an explanation of what and wherefore He destroyed them, our reply is this: In the first place the Holy One neve r has destroyed the work of his hands. The scriptur e referring to the heavens, states: \"The heavens shall vanish away lik e smoke, and the earth shall wax old as a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner\" (Is. li. 6) , from which it has been inferred that the Holy One creates and destroys worlds with their inhabitants according to a certain law. The fact is, that the Holy One crea ted the, world and its population through the law expressed esoter ically in the word \"brashith,\" and referred to in t he following passage: \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, and before he had created anything I was with him\" (Prov. viii. 22); and by this brashith (beginning) he created th e heavens and the earth, the foundations of which w ere based on \"berith\" (law or covenant), the letters of which ar e contained in br(ash)ith. It is of this berith tha t scripture speaks: \"If the law (or covenant) I have made had not exist ed, there would have been no day nor night, heaven nor earth\" (Jer. xxxiii. 25), and it is of this law the Script ure further states: \"The heavens are the Lord's,\" a nd he has given the earth to the children of men. (Ps. cxv. 16.) By the earth the Psalmist means our earth or world, which is one of seven worlds or earths referred to by David: \"I will walk before the Lord in the lands or earths of the livi ng\" (Ps. cxvi. 9). If, therefore, the Lord created worlds and destroye d them by reducing them to a state of tohu and bohu before the creation of the heavens and the earth, it was becau se the berith or law of such creation was not yet e laborated or existent. This is why the earth has escaped the fat e of previous worlds."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"At first God made known this law by the symbolism o f circumcision to the heathen nations of antiquity; but, as they were unwilling to accept it, the earth remained bar ren and unfruitful. This is the esoteric meaning of the words, \"Let the waters be gathered into one place\" (Gen. i. 8), signifying the secret doctrine or knowledge of the divine law; \"into one place\" designates Israel, whose spiritual derivation is from the place of which it is said, \"Blessed be the glory of the Lord in his place\" (Ez. iii. 12), mean ing by \"the Glory of the Lord\" the lower Shekina, a nd \"in his place\" the Shekina on high. As the souls of Israel are uni fied with it, therefore Jehovah is with them and p. 128 over them, for it is written, \"The portion of the L ord is his people\" (Deuter. xxxii. 9). For this rea son, the Scripture also saith, \"Let the waters be gathered together in one place\";25a that is, Israel who accepted the la w, and \"let the dry land or element appear\"; that is, the idolatrou s nations who, unwilling to receive it, have remain ed barren and sterile. This, then, is the explanation of what has been err oneously said: \"God created worlds and destroyed th em\" through caprice. It was because of their rejection of and n on-conformity to the law of nature. According to tr aditions that have been handed down, they, that is, the early rac es and their offspring, were created and called int o existence by the second Divine Form, or hypostasis, symbolized b y the letter H, as it is written \"behibaram\" (whom he created), a word which the most ancient teachers maintain ought to be divided and written \"behi baram,\" meaning, G od created them by the he. This is why the letter H in this wo rd (an anagram of the name Abraham) is found writte n in the Pentateuch smaller than the other letters, and impl ying the barrenness and infertility of the heathen during the fifth or He millenium after creation, which led up to the destruction of the first and second temples. Moses, because he wished to bring these nations to a knowledge of the Divine, believing they had been created by the Divine Form called He, was greatly disappointed and grieved when God said to him: \"Go, get thee do wn, for thy people have sinned\" (Ex. xxxii. 7), in that they ha ve failed in love to H and reverence to V that were due unto them, and have fallen from that high state of spiritual e levation represented by V, the letter which proceed s and is derived from the L and H, and descended from on high along with H in order that not a single soul should be lo st of those who had inhabited previous worlds that had entered into pralaya, symbolized by the captivity of Israel . The souls of the Antediluvians (ereb rah) emanated from those to whom Scripture refers. \"For the heavens shall disa ppear like smoke and the earth wax old as a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner\" (Is. l i. 6). They are also those for whom Noah was unwilling to intercede , and therefore it is written of them, \"And they we re destroyed from the earth\" (Gen. vii. 23). They were the same souls of whom it is also written, \"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven\" (Deuter. x xv. 19). Unthinkingly, Moses caused to descent the being cal led He p. 129 among these men, and was therefore denied the privi lege of25a entering into the Holy Land until He ret urned to its former place on high. When He descended from above Vau came down also. Who shall raise He again on hig h? It is Vau whose presence was not with Moses (the word Mos es is written without a Vau). This is why the lette r He in \"behibaram,\" an anagram as stated of Abraham, is wr itten smaller than the other letters in the book of the law, and to which scripture alludes. \"He brought them forth out of Egypt\" by means of the Vau who, at the same tim e, brought out the He. When the Vau and He became conjoined, t he vow was made. \"The hand of God upon his throne s hall be raised against Amalek, the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation\" (Ex. xvii. 16 ), \"yod al cas Jah milehamah la Jehovah beamalek.\" What is the signification of the words, \"from gener ation to generation\"? They allude to the time of Mo ses. We have been informed by ancient masters that a generation is in number equivalent to 600,000 souls, and there exists a tradition that in the time of Moses each woman bore in her womb potentially the same number of embryos . After the deluge the souls of the antediluvians inc arnated in five different races or nations, viz., t he Nephilim (fallen or degraded), Giborim (mighty ones), Anakim (tall o nes), Rephaim (the giants), and Amalekim (Amalekite s). It was through the last of these that He fell from on high . Balaam and Balak were descendants of Amalek. Take Ain and Mim (a and m) from the former, L and K from the lat ter, and the remaining letters form the word Babel, and the subtracted letters the name Amalek. It is of them t hat Scripture refers, \"therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound (babel) the lan guage of the earth\" (Gen. xl. 9). And they were the y who survived the catastrophe of the deluge of whom it i s said: \"He destroyed every living thing on the fac e of the earth\" (Gen. vii. 23). These five races survived till the time of the four th captivity of Israel, whose chief enemies they we re, and therefore called instruments of iniquity. They are denoted in Scripture by the words, \"And the earth also was co rrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence\" (Gen. vi. 11). Of these, the first race was the Amalekite s. Of the Nephilim it is recorded, \"And the sons of God behel d the daughters of men that they were fair\" (Gen. v i. 2). They were also the second in rank of the angel hosts tha t were cast out of heaven and became incarnated."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" Next: Chapter IX. WHEN the Holy One wished to form man and said: \"Let us make man in our image. \" He intended to set him over the angelic hosts who should be subject to his comm ands. The revolting angels, however, protested and said: \"What is man that he merits Thy regards? (Ps. viii. 5); h e will most certainly sin against Thee and disobey Thy commandments.\" Said the Holy One unto them: \"If ye were on earth below you would become more wicked an d culpable than he.25a-26b And so it happened, for as it is written, as soon as \"they beheld the daughte rs of men that they were fair, they took them wives of all which t hey chose\" (Gen. vi. 2). Therefore, the Holy One hu rled them into the abysmal darkness, where they abide unto this da y. Such was the doom of Asa and Azael, from whom origi nated and were engendered those angelic beings who, through sexual intercourse with their fair and beau tiful human wives, became the fallen ones and thus forfeited the joys of the heavenly world, exchanging its eternal happiness for the fleeting pleasures and delights o f earthly existence, as it is written, \"He repayeth them that hate him, to their faces to destroy them\" (Deuter. vii. 10). p. 131 The Giborim (mighty ones) formed the third race, an d were they whom Scripture describes as \"mighty men which were of old, men of great renown\" (Gen. vi. 4). The y it was who, at the building of the tower of Babel , said: \"Go to and let us build us a city and tower whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name\" (Gen. xi. 4). Becoming incarnated, they were those who built mans ions, colleges, and founded oracles and temples, no t for the worship and glory of the Divine Being, but for thei r own self-exaltation, and then tyrannized over Isr ael as though they were dust of the earth, by plundering and robb ing them of every thing they possessed. Concerning them the Scripture states, \"And the waters prevailed and wer e increased greatly upon the earth\" (Gen. vii. 19). The fourth race was that of the Rephaim or Giants, who, whenever they beheld the children of Israel in sore straits or distress and afflictions, scoffed and derided them and treated with contempt the good law and its stud ents and followers, but regarded with favor and indulgence t he idolatrous and ungodly. Of them it is written, \" The Rephaim (giants) shall not rise again\" (Is. xxvi. 14), and when the redemption and deliverance of Israel shall appear, then will be accomplished the words of scripture respecting t hem, \"Their memory shall perish.\"25b The fifth race was the Anakim (tall ones), a despic able people, of whom it is said: \"The Rephaim were like unto them\" (Deuter. xi. 11). It was through them that th e earth reverted back to its previous state of tohu and bohu, occult words in which is contained the epitome of their hi story and final disappearance from off the face of the earth, which occurred when the light divine appeared in the worl d. Another explanation of the words, \"These are the ge nerations or offspring of the heavens and the earth ,\" is gathered from the words, \"And Aaron took them and cast them into the furnace and formed of them a calf.\" Then s aid the Israelites: \"These (aleh) be thy gods, oh Israel\" ( Ex. xxxii. 4). On the day that all these different races were exterminated, the Holy One along with the Shekina c reated the heavens and the earth anew, as it is wri tten, \"For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make shal l remain before me\" (Is. lxvi. 22), which words are the complement to \"on the day that God created. . . .\" Then it was that God also made to grow out of the g round p. 132 every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good f or food\" (Gen. ii. 4).25b But not until the extermi nation of the above mentioned races did the secret doctrine appea r in the world, and the children of Israel flourish ed and sprung forth as the trees and green herb out of the ground alluded to in scripture; for till then \"the Lord G od had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to t ill the ground\" (Gen. ii. 5). The esoteric meaning of which is, the children of Israel were not there to do sacrifice a nd render worship to the Holy One. A further exposi tion is that the words, \"And every plant of the field,\" denote the f irst Messiah; and the words \"every herb of the fiel d\" a second Messiah. What was the reason for the appearance of these Mes siahs? Because there was no Moses to make intercess ion with the divine Shekina, and therefore is it written, \"T here was no man to till the ground.\" This esoteric meaning and interpretation is also that of the words, \"And the Sceptre shall not depart front Judah\" (Gen. xlix. 1 0), referring to the Messiah son of David; whilst the words, \"nor a prin ce of his posterity,\" denote Messiah the son of Jos eph,--\"Until the coming of Schiloh, \"--signifies Moses; the nume rical value of these two names being the same. The Hebrew words \"velo iqhath\" (to him shall the nations look) are composed of the same letters as \"velevi, qehat h\" (hevi and Qohath) the ancestors of Moses. Also, \"every plant of the field,\" signifies the righteous whose souls emanated from him who is termed \"The Just One,\" who is the life o f the world and abideth forever. The word \"shiah\" ( plant) is composed of the letter Sh, the branches of which sy mbolize the three Patriarchs and \"hai\" (life) denot ing the Eternal One who alone hath life and immortality. The follow ing word \"eaheb\" (every herb) denotes the union of the seventy-two branches of the celestial tree, and whi ch only became united with the Shekina on the appea rance of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Adam (the man) whose name in its numerical value is equal to that of Jehovah. The words, \"and every he rb of the field before it grew out of the ground\" denote also The Just One, of whom it is written, \"Truth shall spring out of the ground\" (Ps. lxxxv. 11), and \"The Truth shall be se nt down upon the earth\" (Dan viii. 12.) These passa ges signify that students of the secret doctrine, like the gree n herb, will spring up during the period of captivi ty; that the truth will become recognized and prevail when Moses comet h again, of whom it is written, \"The p. 133 jaw of truth was in his mouth\" (Mal. ii. 1); so tha t no one was better able to unfold and expound Divi ne mysteries than he. When he returns, \"a mist shall go forth fr om the earth and water the whole face of the ground \" (Gen. ii. 1); that, is. Ad (a mist). shall be taken from Adonai ( Lord) and V and N becoming added to it shall form A don, master or lord of the earth, by whom it shall be watered. Then will Israel understand the full meaning of the secret doctrine. The word Ad, translated in the targum or Chaldean p araphrase a cloud, designates also him who is refer red to in scripture as \"The cloud of the Lord was upon the ta bernacle by day\" (Ex. xl. 38). It is by him that th e masters of the secret doctrine and all students of the good law sh all be enlightened and flourish when He cometh agai n. Next: Chapter X. Symbolisms of Man SYMBOLISMS OF MAN. \"And the Lord God formed man\" (Gen. ii. 7), that is , Israel. Here the word vayitzer (formed) is writte n with two yods or I's, indicating that the Holy One formed hi m with two natures, the higher and lower self; the one divine, the other earthly, and impressed upon his form the divi ne name, I V I, expressed by the two eyes and the n ose between them, thus: I. The numerical value of these letters is 26, which is also that of the divine name, Jeho vah.25b-26a It is on this account that scripture saith, \"From t he top of the rocks I shall see Him\" (Num. xxiii. 9 ). The word zurim (rocks) denotes also forms, so that Balaam who utte red these words, meant that in viewing the form of Israel, he beheld and recognized the divine name. Another comparison of Israel with this Divine name is in the two tables of stone containing the law an d representing two I's, the letter V symbolizing what is written o n them. Man also in himself represents the union an d blending together of the higher and lower Shekinas, symboliz ed by the repeating of the Shema, morning and eveni ng. The union of the two natures in man is also referre d to in the words, \"Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\" (Gen. ii. 23). We also read that God planted man, that is , Israel, in the sacred garden of Eden, as it is wr itten, \"And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden\" (G en. ii. 15). Jehovah Alhim, the Lord God; that is, the heavenly father and mother; \"garden,\" the lower Shekina; \"in Eden,\" the heavenly mother; p. 134 [paragraph continues] \"the man,\" the middle column of the sephirotic tre e; from which was formed his wife, and who being his delight should never be separated from hi m. It was then that the Holy One planted Israel, who a re the holy branches of the world, or, in other wor ds, a race purer and better than those that had formerly existed; as it is written, \"The branch of my planting, the wor k of my hands, that I may be glorified\" (Is. Ix. 21). \"And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree tha t is pleasant to the sight and good for food\" (Gen. ii. 9). \"The Lor d God denoting the celestial father and mother; \"ev ery tree that is pleasant to the sight,\" the Just; and \"good for foo d,\" the middle column consisting of the sephiroth k ether, tiphereth, yesod, etc., and from which proceed those stores of food by which the righteous are sustained and whic h, when mankind becomes purified and enlightened, will cont ribute to the life of the world.26a Then will every one take of the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and ea t and live for ever more.Gen. 3:22 The tree of the knowledge of good and evil symboliz es those whose intellectual faculties are directed only to phenomenal objects that can be seen and handled, an d by whom the presence and operation of the Shekina in nature, in the life of nations and in the soul of man himse lf, are unrecognized and ignored; and thus it will be until the times of error and darkness pass away; then will they als o become proselytes of the divine life of whom it w ill be said: \"The Lord alone is their leader and there is no str ange god in their midst\" (Deuter. xxxii. 12); and, human nature transformed and enlightened and purified, mankind w ill become as a tree that, in its stately form and beauty, is pleasant to the sight. The tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil occasioned Israel to fall into error which they should have avoided and remembered the divine comma nd admonishing them to \"Eat not of the tree\" of Goo d and Evil, on pain and penalty of spiritual death involv ing loss of union with the Divine, without which th ere can be no interior enlightenment, no spiritual development. T his command with its twice repeated warning, \"thou shalt die, thou shalt die,\" refers also to the children of Isr ael who endured two great calamities, the destructi on of the first and second temples, and the loss of the higher and lowe r Shekina or manifestation of the Divine presence i n their midst, as expressed and typified in the words, \"And the ri ver shall be dried up\" (Ia. xix. 5), p. 135"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"and which then became resolved in Ain Soph, the Bou ndless One, whence it emanated at first. This aridity or state of dryness will not however c ontinue always, for when Israel comes out of captiv ity then will the river that was dried up and wasted go forth aga in out of Eden to water the garden, and divine know ledge cover the earth as the waters cover the seas. This recurrence and reappearance of the Divine Pres ence amongst mankind is mystically referred to in t he words, \"Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord\" (Is. lviii. 14).26a-26b The word anag (delight or joy) i n this passage of scripture is composed of the initial letters of \"Ed en,\" Nahar (a river), and Gan (a garden.) Then also shall be accomplished and fulfilled the words of scripture: \"Then Moses and the children of Israel shall sing\" (not sang, as generally translated--Ex. xv. 1) for error and idol atry symbolized by Pharaoh and his hosts will he destroyed and pass away forever. Furthermore, we read, \"the river that went forth out of Eden to water the ground wa s parted and became into four heads\" (Gen. ii. 10). These four h eads or channels are symbolized on the sephirotic t ree by chesed (mercy) which forms the right arm, teaching that he who desires to become wise should always turn hims elf to the south, the quarter presided over by Michael and his hosts, along with Judah and two other tribes of Is rael, whilst he who prays for wealth should turn towards the north where is stationed Gabriel with his hosts, along wi th Dan and two other tribes.. The third channel is symbolized by Netzach (triumph or victory), the right limb of the sephirotic tree presided over by Nuriel with his hosts, along with Reuben and two other tribes. The left limb is Hod (splendor). It is to this sephira that, what is said of Jacob, is applied, \"And he halted upon his thigh (Gen. xxx ii. 31). The fourth head is presided over by Raphael and his hosts, alo ng with Ephraim and two other tribes. The mission a nd work of this ruler is the healing and assuagement of the af flictions of the captivity. The words, \"and became parted into four heads\" refe r also to four individuals who gained entrance into the mysterious garden of Eden, or Paradise. The first e ntered it by the channel Pishon, that is, \"Pishoneh halakhoth\" (the mouth that teaches the good law). The second, by Gi hon (the place where is buried he who creepeth on h is belly-- Levit. xl. 42). It is under the presidency of Gabri el whose name is composed of the words p. 136 [paragraph continues] Gebra, al (divine man), and who is alluded to in t he words,26b \"the man who walks on a hidden path and whom God has covered as with a veil\" (Job. iii. 23), and also in the following passage: \"No m an knoweth unto this day the place of his sepulchre\" (Deuter. xxxiv. 6); the esoteric signification of which is u nderstood only by those initiated in the secret doctrine. The third i ndividual entered by the channel called Hiddekel or Had qal (the adapting word), the third part of the secret doctri ne imparted to initiates and known as Darash (expos ition). The fourth entered by Phrath, the channels through whic h flows the principle of fecundity. Ben Zoma and Be n Azai, who penetrated into and attained to the knowledge of th e secret doctrine concealed within its esoteric cov ering, by their wrong use of it found it a curse instead of a bless ing, whilst to Rabbi Akiba it became a blessing and a source of joy, tranquillity and power. Next: Chapter XI. The Strange Visitor \"THE STRANGE VISITOR.\" As Rabbi Simeon concluded his remarks, Rabbi Eleaza r, his son, spake and said: My father! I along with other students were one day discussing in the college a r emarkable saying of Rabbi Akiba to his novitiates, viz., \"When you come to places paved with pure white marble gli ttering in the sunlight, you should not say here is water, for then ye will expose yourselves to the danger expressed i n the words, 'He that speaketh lies shall not tarry in my sight'\" (Ps. ci. 7). Suddenly there appeared in our midst an aged and ve nerable looking man who said unto us: \"What may be the subject of your discussion.\" Having informed him th ereof, he said: \"Truly it was a most dark and abstr use saying and had been a subject of discussion in the celesti al college. In order that you may grasp and compreh end its latent meaning, I have come hither in order to give you an explanation which has not heretofore been granted or given to any man of this generation. Stones of white and gli ttering marble symbolize the pure waters that sprin g forth and take their origin from the fountain. Aleph (A) deno tes the beginning and end or sum total of created l ife. The letter vav, separating the higher from the lower yod, symb olizes the tree of life, the fruit of which gives i mmortality. The two yods have the same meaning as in the word vayit zer (and p. 137 he created) denoting the two appearances of the Div ine Presence26b-27a under the form of the higher an d lower sephiroth called hochma (wisdom) and symbolized by the two yods or I's. This hochma is found just belo w the sephiroth kether (crown) and denotes the beginning and end of all things. The two yods also symbolize the two eyes of these sephiroth from which fell two tears unto t he great abyss of primal matter. Why did they fall? Because of the two tables of the law which Moses brought down from on high, which the children of Israel were unable to"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"appreciate to their advantage. They were therefore broken and destroyed. The same cause occasioned the destruction of the first and second temples, for the vav had ta ken flight and disappeared. Other tables of the law were then given with affirmative and negative precepts, rewards and penalties corresponding to the sephiroth on the ri ght and left sides of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, fr om which the law as now promulgated, came forth. Th e sephiroth on the right side symbolize life; those o n the left, death. This then was why Rabbi Akiba said to his students: \"When ye behold pavements of pure white marble, ye shall not say they are water, or to be more explicit, do not confound together the law of the lower nature (the flesh) with that of the higher (spirit), for the one inflicts death, the other gives life. Do not fall into the error o f imagining that they are one and the same, lest convicted of inexactitud e, ye come under the category of those mentioned in Scripture. \"He that speaketh lies shall not tarry in my sight\" (Ps. ci. 7). The difference between the two sets o f tables of the law was this; the first that was broken and destroyed p roceeded from the tree of life, the other from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and corresponded, as we have stated, to the right and left sides of the se phirotic tree, and this is why it is said, \"A wise man's heart is on the right hand, but a fool's on the left hand\" ( Eccles. x. 2). At the conclusion of these words we all crowded rou nd the venerable stranger to embrace him, but he su ddenly vanished out of sight and we saw him no more. Resum ing his discourse Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"There is yet another exposition of the words 'And a river went out of Eden.' This Edenic river symbol ized the tree of life in the spiritual world; that stands fair an d beautiful amidst all p. 138 that is pure and holy, as it is written, 'Evil shal l not dwell with thee' (Ps. v. 4); 'went out of Ede n,' denotes Enoch or Metatron the great angel of the Divine Presence and who came from the higher Eden of the Holy One (whi ch is never infested with inferior orders of angelic bein gs) to take charge of the lower or earthly Eden and protect it from the assaults and ingress of demons. It was the gard en into which Ben Azar, Ben Zoma and Elisha, found an entrance; and from the tree of good and evil planted in it ca me forth the law inscribed on the two tables of sto ne containing on one side positive precepts and on the other negativ e commandments, respecting what ought to be done an d what left undone, what is pure and lawful and what is impure and unlawful.\" As Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking, there rose up in t he midst of his audience an aged stranger grave and venerable in appearance and aspect and exclaimed: \"Rabbi! Rabbi! what thou hast just spoken is true.2 7a The tree of good and evil is not the tree of lif e. The esoteric doctrine of the two yods in the word vayitzer is th is: They denote and symbolize two separate creation s, one good, the other evil; one of life, the other of death; of things commanded and things forbidden, and are all uded to in the words, \"And the Lord God formed the man out of dust from the earth and breathed into his nostrils or s oul the breath of life,\" the divine Shekina. Man is a threefold pr oduct of life (nephesh), spirit (rauch), and soul ( neschamah), by the blending and union of which he became a living spir it, a manifestation of the Divine.\" Having uttered these words, the unknown stranger su ddenly vanished out of sight, leaving the students lost in wonder and amazed. Then spake Rabbi Simeon and said : \"We have been honored with the presence in our mids t of a great adept, and what he has spoken is in st rict conformity with the words and teaching of Scripture .\" Next: Chapter XII. Symbolism of the Divine Life and Human Destiny SYMBOLISM OF THE DIVINE LIFE AND HUMAN DESTINY. \"AND the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it\"27a (Gen . 11:15). The question may be asked: \"Whence did He take him? \" The answer is: \"From the four elements, fire, air , earth and water, which form the basis of man's physical body and are symbolized by the words 'And a river went o ut of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads'\" (Gen. 11:10). That is, the Holy One formed man from these four elements and placed him in the garden of Eden, into which a man enters agai n whenever he repents of his wrongdoing and conforms his life to the good law, until at length, divested of mortality, he is placed again in the heavenly garden; that is, he enters into and becomes a conscious participant of the divine life and clothed with immortality. \"To dress it and to keep it,\" meaning to keep and observe all the p recepts of the good law, obedience to which imparts to and endows him with power to control these elements and drink of the river of the water of life--as disobedience causes him to drink of the bitter waters flowing from and by the tree of evil, symbolizing the tempter, so that instead of ruling and controlling the elements he becomes their slave . Then occurs what is written concerning the children of Israel when they came to the waters of Marah: \" They could not p. 140"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"drink of the waters for they were bitter\" (Ex. xv. 23). Disobedience to the good law of rightdoing alw ays, sooner or later, results in bitterness of life, thought and f eeling, and only by rightdoing can the words of scr ipture be accomplished. \"And the Lord showed him a tree, which, when he cas t into the waters, the waters, though bitter, were made sweet.\" The tree here spoken of is the \"Tree of Life,\" the Divine or Higher Life. \"And if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and wilt do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his comman dments, I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have b rought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord that h ealeth thee\" (Ex. xv. 26). What does all this mean, What is the secret doctrine or teaching inculcated in these wor ds? It is that when this our human life becomes dark and embittere d with sorrow and sadness through weakness and fail ing to live in accordance with the good law; there is only one agent or power that can clarify it and cause i t to become again pure and sweet and clear; it is the Divine wi thin us, \"healing all our diseases, redeeming from all evil, and satisfying with good things, so that our youth is r enewed like the eagles\" (Ps. ciii. 4, 5). It was th rough the instrumentality of Moses that the waters at Marah w ere made sweet, and he therefore represents the Mes siah. Of Moses it is said: \"And the rod (mateh) was in hi s hand.\" The word rod designates Metatron, the ange l before the throne or Divine Presence and from whom cometh life or death. When it is changed or transformed into a rod, it is a source of help and assistance to man, as it then co mes from the side of good. When, however, it is tra nsformed into a serpent, it is then not a blessing, but otherwise t o him, and this is why Moses in his fear fled from it.27a-27b The Holy gave it into the hand of Moses and so was form ed and came forth the oral and written law relative to things lawful and forbidden. But immediately Moses struck the rock with it; then was it taken from him as it is written: \"And the Egyptian had a rod in his hand and Benaiah plucked it out of his hand\" (2 Sam. 23:21 ). The rod of Moses symbolizes also the serpent or tempter, who was the cause of the captivity of Israel. The words \"And f rom thence it was parted into four heads\" have yet another symbol ical and occult meaning. Blessed is he whose study is in the secret doctrine, for, when the Holy One takes his s oul unto himself, it leaves the body formed out of the four elements, and rising on high is placed at the head of the p. 141 four Hayoth , or living creatures, to whom the words refer: \"In their hands shall they bear thee up\" (Ps. xci. 12) . \"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying: 'Of ev ery tree of the garden thou mayst freely eat, but o f the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it'\" (Gen. ii. 16, 17). Now, wherever the word zav (commandment) is found in Scripture it is to forbid idolatry, the tendency toward which comes from the liver ( chabad ), which word signifies hard, bitter, or grievous, and therefore idolatry is called or termed a hard s ervice. The liver moreover is the seat of rage and wrath, a nd this is why it is said that whoso giveth way to anger and rage is as culpable as he who commits an act of idolatry. A nd this is the meaning of the words \"And God comman ded the man,\" that is, in forbidding idolatry he also forba de the indulgence in anger, for they proceed from o ne common source and lead to the shedding of blood and \"whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be sh ed\" (Gen. ix. 6). The penchant for murder comes from the live r and is as a sword in the hand of the angel of dea th,27b and \"The end or results of it is bitter as wormwood and sharper than a two-edged sword\" (Prov. v. 4). The word \" saying \" signifies the spleen, of which it is said \"she eate th and wipeth her mouth and saith, 'I have done no wickedness,'\" (Prov. xxx. 20). This organ has no orifice nor cana l, but is a solid substance with veins and arteries and absorbs dark blood from the liver. Adultery is therefore in scri pture symbolized by the spleen, as its perpetration leaves no traces behind it, whilst murder becomes quickly detected b y bloodmarks and therefore men fear to commit murde r more than adultery. When these sins of idolatry, murder and adultery, c ease to prevail among mankind, in that day there sh all be one Lord, and his name One. On this account a man who i s a true Israelite will find his unity in the secre t doctrine, which is as a tree of life to them that lay hold of it, and \"happy is everyone that obtaineth her\" (Pr ov. lv. 18). This tree of life is the Matrona, symbolized by the tent h Sephira Malcuth (Kingdom). This is why Israelites or children of light are called Beni Melchim (sons of kings). It is also why the Holy One said: \"It is not good that man should be alone. I will make him a helpmate for or against hi m\" (Gen. ii. 18), by which is meant the Mischna, wh ich is as a helpmate to the Schekina and proved of great benefi t during the captivity by teaching what was lawful and what forbidden, what was pure and what impure. If Israel , however, p. 142 should cease to respect the Mischna as a spouse, th en instead27b-28a of a helpmate to him, it would be come a helpmate against him and there could never he harmo ny between them until the cause of dissonance were done away by purity of life and worship. This is the reason that Moses was not interred with in the precincts of the Holy land and no one knowet h to this day the place of his sepulchre. The sepulchre signifies the Mischna which was prevalent over the Matrona i n the early days of Israel, during which the King and Matrona b ecame separated from the celestial spouse. Therefor e saith the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"scripture: \"For three things the earth is disquiete d and for four which it cannot bear. For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with meat, for an odio us woman when she is married, and a handmaid when s he takes the place of her mistress\" (Prov, xxx. 21, 23). The servant that reigns refers to Samail or Satan. The handmaid that takes the place of her mistress, designates the Mis chna, whilst the fool filled with meat denotes the strangers living in the camp of Israel who were ignorant and foolish . Again Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air\" (Gen. ii. 19). Woe unto those whos e hearts are hardened and eyes blinded so that they are unable to understand and appreciate the teachings of the secr et doctrine and know not that the \"beast of the fie ld\" and the \"fowl of the air\" symbolize those who are ignorant and, though possessing life (nephesh) and soul ( haya ), are of no advantage or benefit either to the Schekina whilst in captivity, or to Moses who never quitted or fors ook her for a moment, or, in other words, who recognize not the r eality of the Divine Life nor the existence of the Higher Self. Here Rabbi Eleazar asked a question: \"What was the great object of life with an Israelite during the t ime of Moses?\" \"Eleazar, my son,\" replied Rabbi Simeon, \"why dost thou ask such a question as this? Hast thou not rea d and studied the words of Scripture? 'I am he who declares the e nd from the beginning and from ancient times the th ings that are not yet done'\" (Is. xlvi. 10). \"Yes,\" replied Rabbi Eleazar, \"and I recognize them as true.\" This is why we are taught by tradition that Moses i s not dead and is therefore called \"man,\" of whom i t is said: \"There was not found a helpmeet for him\" (Gen. ii. 20). But everything p. 143 was against him and he found no help in bringing th e Schekina out of captivity as it is written: \"And he looked this way and that way and he saw there was no man\" (Ex. ii. 12). At that moment, scripture saith: \"And the Lord God caused a deep28a sleep to fall upon the man and He took one of the ribs and closed up the flesh thereo f\" (Gen. ii. 21). \"The Lord God\" denotes the Divine Being as fat her and Mother; \"a deep sleep\" the captivity, which is also the meaning of the words \"a deep sleep fell upon Abraha m\" (Gen. xv. 12). \"And He took one of the ribs\"--fr om whom? From the virgins of the Matrona. The divine Father and Mother took a virgin from the white or right si de of her, designated in scripture as \"fair as the moon\" (Cant . vi. 10). \"And closed up the flesh in its place,\" signifying the union of the celestial with the animal nature of ma n. The words \"for that he also is flesh\" (Gen. vi. 3), refer to Moses, whose physical form radiated light golden hu ed like that of the sun, as it is written: \"The fac e of Moses was as the face of the Sun,\" whilst that of the virgin of the right side was like the moon. Therefore scri pture saith: \"Thou art fair as the moon and clear as the sun\" (Cant. v i. 10). Another signification of the words, \"And cl osed up the flesh in its place\" is that the Father and Mother wished to protect ( vaisgor ) her, as it is written: \"And the Lord shut ( vaisgor ) him in (Gen. vii. 16). \"And of the rib which the Lord God had taken from m an, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man\" (Gen. ii. 23). In this verse is an allusion to the mystery of the marital affinity. We are taught that when this affinity is ignored and disregarded the consequences are most injurious . The Holy One in his operations has worked on the law of affinity, as it is written : \"The Lord (IHVH) hath built Jerusalem\" (Ps. cxlvi i. 2). The V in the divine name IHVH is the son or child of I and H, the Father and the Mot her, to whom scripture refers: \"And the Lord God ma de of the rib which he had taken from man.\" This rib denotes the middle column in the sephirotic Tree of Life symbol of the virgin, of whom it is written: \"For I, saith Jehova h, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her\" (Zech. ii. 5). It is for this reason that the future temple, glori fied and perfected humanity, built and formed by th e Holy One, will endure forever. It is of this temple that scripture speaks. The glory of this latter house shall be gr eater than that of the former (Hag. ii. 9), which was built by man's hands , but this shall be p. 144 built by the Holy One, and is alluded to by the Psa lmist:28a-28b \"Except the Lord build the house, the y labor in vain that build it\" (Ps. cxxvii. 1). The words \"And the Lord God formed the rib he had taken\" equally apply to Moses, who, when building the tabernacle in the wilderness , foresaw the future tabernacle God would form, as it is written: \"And for the second side (rib) of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards\" (Ex. xxvi. 20). The north side here refers to the side of the sephiroti c tree called Chesed (mercy), and known as the white side. \"And closed up the flesh thereof.\" The word flesh signif ies the red side of the tree which is called Geburah (power), and at this time were fulfilled the words: \"His left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me \" (Cant. ii. 6), as also the words: \"This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.\" She shall be called ashah because she was taken from aish (man), that is to say, that the virgin humanity is a union of the man or father representing the male principle, with the mother, representing the female principle. When the temple just referred to is completed, each individual will find his companion or mate-soul pr edestined from the beginning to become united with him, and t hen will be realized the words of the prophet: \"And I will also"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"give you a new heart and a new spirit will I put wi thin you\" (Ezech. xxxv. 26), as also the words of a nother prophet: \"And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, y our old men shall dream dreams, your young men shal l see visions\" (Joel ii. 28), alluding to the renewed sta te of humanity in the future, as tradition expresse s it. The son of David or the Messiah will not appear until all soul s now incarnating shall have reached perfection and accomplished their destiny, and those who have lost their Higher Self and have failed to become united with it shal l be exterminated from the world. \"And they were both na ked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed\" (G en. ii. 25), referring to the time when licentiousness and sensuality shall disappear and vanish out of the wo rld and nothing exist causing a sense of shame and immodesty. Next: Chapter XIII. p. 145 NOW the serpent was more subtle than any beast of t he field which the Lord God had made\" (Gen. iii. 1) . \"Beast of the field\" signifies the idolatrous nations who are the offspring and progeny of the old serpent who t empted and seduced Eve to do evil by exciting selfishness and other animal propensities within her. Under their i nfluence she conceived and brought forth Cain, who killed28b Abe l his brother, the shepherd of whom the scripture t erms \" beschagam ,\" \"because he is flesh.\" This word also is used of Moses, who killed the Egyptian. Moses may also be regarded as the eldest son of Adam. When the childr en went up out of Egypt, a great multitude of stran gers went with them and became intermingled with them. Also, during their sojourn in the wilderness and on their journey to the promised land, strangers belonging to another n ation, such as the Kenites of whom Jethro, the fath er-in-law of Moses, was the head, flung in their lot with and dw elt amongst the Israelites. These strangers or alie ns Moses wished to convert and make one with the children of Israel. The Holy One who counts a good intention a s a good action, said unto him: \"Thou desirest what is impos sible. Through them thy descendants will suffer. It was such as they who caused Adam to sin and disobey after it ha d been said unto him: 'From the tree of knowledge o f good and evil shalt thou not eat,' and it will be they who w ill cause the children of Israel p. 146 to go into captivity, and also through them thou wi lt not be able28b to enter into the promised land.\" The failure of Moses to enter along with the Israel ites into the Holy land was owing to the murmurings and cries of these strangers causing him, in a moment of anger, to strike the rock with the rod God had given him, instead of speaking to the rock as he had been commanded (Nunn . xx. 8). Like Adam, in his disobedience, so Moses too had to suffer the penalty for his act of disobedience. But as the Holy One rewards the good intention equally as the good deed, therefore He said to Moses: \"I will make of t hee a greater nation and mightier than they\" (Num. xiv. 12). The Holy One said: \"Whoso hath sinned against me, him w ill I blot out of my book\" (Ex. xxxii. 33), which w ords apply to the descendants of Amalek, of whom it is written : \"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek, f or they it was that caused the tables of the law to be broken. \" \"And their eyes were opened and they saw they were naked\" (Gen. iii. 7) refers to Israel when they wer e living amidst the mud and clay of Egypt and had no knowled ge of the secret doctrine. Therefore spake the prop het concerning them: \"Thou art naked and bare\" (Ezek. x vi. 7). This is also why Job repeated the word \"nak ed.\" \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither\" (Job i. 21.). He used the word shameh (thither), which has the same letters as Moseh (Moses), to show that he, Moses, wished to convert the strangers and that hereafter he will reincarnate and appear again to I srael in order to proclaim and make known the Schek ina. These words of Job also refer to the time when Israel in captivity would perceive they were naked or devoid of the secret doctrine, and therefore said: \"Jehovah hath given, Jehovah hath taken away, may the name of Jehovah be blessed.\" And they sewed figleaves together and made themselv es aprons\" (Gen. iii. 7). The meaning of these word s is, that man will cloak himself with the frail coverings of his own sinful propensities when he perceives himse lf naked and has nothing to hide and cover what should be hidden . The garment with which Israel covers himself is t he legal robe with its fringes and borders and also the phylacter ies and sandals, and therefore scripture saith: \"An d the Lord God made unto Adam and his wife coats of skins and clot hed them\" (Gen. iii. 21). The hagoroth (coats or coverings) is here used in order to distinguish the p. 147 legal robe, and therefore it is written \" hagor .\" \"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh and make thy glor y and majesty appear\" (Ps. xlv. 3), referring to the Shema repeat ed when each one is arrayed in the legal robe when \"the high praises of God are in their mouth and a two-edged s word in their hand\" (Ps. cxlix. 6). \"And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking i n the garden\" (Gen. iii. 8). These words allude to the voice of God heard by Israel when at Mount Sinai, and as scr ipture saith: \"Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire?\" (Deuter. iv. 33). On hearing this voice the strangers or aliens (Ereb. Rah) in Israel perished, for they it was who said: \"Let not God sp eak with us lest we die\" (Ex. xx. 19). After their death the law"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"was given. The ignorant of the present time who kno w not and recognize no other law than that of selfi shness, are incarnations of these strangers and are indicated b y the words: \"Cursed is he that lieth with any mann er of beast\" (Deuter. xxvii. 21), because they derive their orig in from the serpent to whom it was said:28b-29a \"Cu rsed art thou above all cattle and above every beast of the field \" (Gen. iii. 14). Many impurities exist in Israel and are as dangerou s and noxious as snakes and serpents. There are tho se that originated at first from the tempter, also those of idolators who resemble the wild animals and savage beasts of the field. There is also the impurity arising from wron gdoing in daily life and still more, the impurity o f the evil-minded. All these are found afflicting Israel, yet is there no greater impurity than that of Amalek or that pe rsonified evil called and known as \"The God of this world.\" It is that \"which poisons all within and hardens all the feeling.\" It causes the death of the soul and transforms it into an idolater, a worshipper of the world and its gol den image of wealth. Its occult name is Samael, \"The poison God. \" Though Samael was the name of the serpent that te mpted and seduced Adam and Eve, yet are they one and the same and are both cursed alike. \"And the Lord God called the man and said 'Where ar t thou?'\" ( aicha ). In this verse God showed to Adam the destruction of the temple or holy place, causing gr eat sorrow and anguish of heart, as alluded to in t he verse of scripture beginning with this word \" aicha .\" \"How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people\" (Lam. i. 1). In both these passages of scripture this word \" aicha \" is as a mournful note in a bar of music. It will not, however, always be so. The time will arrive p. 148 when the Holy One shall banish and destroy all evil in the world as it is written: \"Death is swallowed up forever and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces an d the rebuke of his people (humanity) shall be take n away from off all the earth\"29a (Is. xxv. 8), and in that day Jehovah shall be One and His name One.Zech. 14:9 We are taught by tradition that all which Solomon w rote in the \"Song of Songs\" has reference to the Ki ng of Peace who, though he rules below, yet has his kingdom on high and thus is king of both worlds. This is occul tly signified by the letter B, whose numerical value is two, plac ed at the beginning of the word hochma in the Scripture, \"be- hochma, by wisdom is the house built\" (Prov. xxiv. 3), and also in the verse \"King Solomon made himsel f a sedan of the wood of Lebanon\" (Cant. iii. 9). By the word se dan ( thequna ) is meant the renovation of the lower world by the action, and influence of the higher world, the acti on of the Higher Self on the lower nature. Before t he creation the existence of the Divine Being was unknown and his a ttributes nameless and unrecognized, and, as there was no speech or tongue to express his glory and being, Hi s name was hidden and concealed in Himself. When th e Holy One created the universe He impressed upon it marks of design and formed worlds which did not endure, but perished and passed away. Then the Divine, Ain Soph (the boundless One) surrounded or enveloped Himsel f with a garment of light of transcendent brilliance, from w hich emanated and came forth the great and lofty tr ees of Lebanon, and the twenty-two letters became the seda n or chariot of God. The law by which the world was created (the ten words) was established and confirmed so th at it changeth not. This is the meaning of the abov e verse, as also of the words \"The trees of the field together with the cedars of Lebanon which the Lord hath planted, are full of sap\" (Ps. civ. 16), for they have been planted by the Ki ng of Peace for his glory in order that every one m ay know and recognize that He is One and His name is One--that His name is Jehovah the most High above all the ear th. By this manifestation of the Divine a way of access has been opened and the light thereof has become v isible throughout the universe and is the light that enlig hteneth every man that cometh into the world. It is circumambient as the air and, like the ocean, rolls all round the world. From it hath proceeded all things and unto it all things shall return as it is written: \"All the rivers run into t he sea, yet the sea is not full--unto the place p. 149 whence the rivers come, thither shall they return a gain\" (Eccles. i. 7). The light divine attracts and draws all other lights, so that they become at last blended and uni fied with it. This final consummation is alluded to in the words \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley\" ( Cant. ii. 1), the word Sharon signifying field or r ather the ocean that absorbs all the rivers) of the world which pro ceed from and return into it again. Be-hochma , \"by wisdom the house has been built.\" The letter Beth or B, whose numerical value, as we have stated , is two, signifies the two kingdoms, celestial and t errestrial, of heaven and earth (the lower and High er Self). It is by the establishment of the celestial on the terrestri al, or of heaven upon earth, that the house of the King (humanity) will become united and the King will rejoice therea t, for then the two kingdoms will become one and th en the new and living way will become opened to those who make themselves susceptible and receptive of the Higher and Diviner life. Therefore is it written \" Brashith, bra Alhim \" (Gen. i. 1). The two kingdoms created by Alhim (B --two, rashit --kingdoms) for the kingdom is called reshith (begi nning) according to the words \" Reshith Hochma .\" Before the manifestation of Alhim, the celestial or primal light resembled a great frozen ocean and rivers co uld not flow into it, as they like it were frozen also. It was t his great congealed29a-29b ocean to which Job refer red: \"Out of whose womb came the ice?\" (Job xxxviii. 29). As lon g as the ocean remained frozen, so long was it of n o benefit to"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"man, and the rivers ceased running their courses in to it. When the north sea is frozen it continues so until the advent of the south wind with its heat and warmth. The riv ers and streams then begin to flow again towards th e south and from their waters, the beasts of the field, as scri pture saith, do quench their thirst. Thus will it be when the Higher Self of humanity ru les over its lower nature. The ice will dissolve an d melt away, the waters of divine life will flow continuously, a nd every voice shall sing and give thanks to heaven for its deliverance from Self. This glorious consummation i s symbolized by the sounding of the shophar or trumpet, the prelude of the great deliverance. There is a furthe r allusion to this union of the higher and lower ki ngdoms (the human with the divine life) in the words \"As long a s the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth\" (I. Sam. xx. 31), for divine life upon the earth is only possible through the Messiah, the son of Jesse. He it is who is mas ter and lord over all, and p. 150 from him the earth (humanity and individual life) r eceiveth its nourishment and sustenance. This is why the scripture says, ve-ath haaretz (and the earth).29b-30a The letter V joined to ath designates the nourishment of the world which comes from Alhim. Th e ath , composed of the first and last letters of the Heb rew alphabet, denotes also the Alhim who dwelleth in th e heavens as it is written \"Go forth ye daughters o f Sion and behold King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mo ther crowned him on the day of his marriage\" (Cant. iii. 11). As Alhim , by the operation of the two supreme sephiroth, th e one male and the other female, descended below, therefore is he lord of the heaven and earth by con joining and making them one, He it was who, attract ed heaven to earth whilst the King on high attracts the earth to heaven, each of which has its own special way or p ath, that of the earth being broad and wide and referred to in scrip ture as \"The path of the just is as the shining lig ht\" (Prov. iv. 18), whilst that leading to the Kingdom of heaven (the h igher life) is referred to in the words \"There is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vulture's eye haft not s een, the lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it\" (Job xxviii. 7, 8). The mystery of these two different ways is expresse d thus: \"Who maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters (Is. xliii. 16), and also by the Psalmist: \" Thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great wat ers\" (Ps. lxxvii. 19). When these two worlds become united and blende d together they are symbolized by the union of the male and female, the one being then the complement of the ot her. It is also written: \"Lift up your eyes on high and behold! Mi (who) hath created aleh (these)\" (Is. xl. 26). In these words is expressed the whole work of creation, for by Mi above and Aleh below everything has been formed and made. And thi s is why at the very beginning of the book of Genes is, the letter B is repeated twice, as also the letter A in the consecutive words \" Brashith Bra, Alhim, Ath ;\" B representing the female and A the male principle. I t is from these two letters that all the other lett ers have proceeded, the total of which is denoted by the Hashamayim (the heavens). The letter V prefixed to the word ve-ath haaretz (and the earth) shows that the H gives birth to hea ven, and a way to it, whilst V gives birth to earth , and provides it with nourishment and everything that p. 151 it needs to sustain it. The word ve-ath also indicates that the V30a takes the A and Th, s ymbolical of the beginning and end, and by their conjunction the earth is fed and supported. The occult mystery of this is expres sed in the words \"All the rivers run into the sea\" (Eccles. i. 7). There is no effect without a cause, is a truth that cannot be denied. Yet our judgments concerning eff ects are often erroneous. For instance, the sound we hear when an anvil is struck by a hammer does not proceed from t he anvil, as imagined, but is the result of their concussion whi ch causes vibration in the air. Also volcanic flame s are not due to the earth from which they come forth, but to the fi re in the interior of it. When scripture saith: \"An d Mount Sinai was enveloped in smoke, because the Lord descended thereon in the midst of the fire\" (Ex. xix., 18), i t signifies the conjunction of heaven and earth, the bringing toget her and union of the spiritual and material. Everyt hing that takes place on earth has its cause in the invisible and n oumenal world, which in scripture is described as, and said to be, the right hand of God, while the earth or world of effects is des cribed as the left hand . \"Mine hand also hath laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand hath sp anned the heavens. I will call them and they shall stand up before me\" (Is. xlviii. 13), the heavens representing the male principle on the right hand, earth the female principle, on the left hand, both of them found together before Him. Such is also the meaning of the words \"Lift up your eyes and behold Mi (who) hath made Aleh (these),\" Mi and Aleh being the complement of each other. Before creation it was impossible to form any conception of the cr eator, as hochma (wisdom) was hidden and unrevealed as the Primal B eing. Only after the apparition of the Divine light in the universe and its rays beamed forth and became v isible, could its existence be cognized and percept ible, its nature and quality being transcendently bright and pelluci d. When, however, its apperception began, then the question arose Mi (who or what is it?) Without this Mi or Who? Aleh (these or that) could not have come i nto existence. The mystery of the origin of all things is adverted to in the words, already quoted, \"Out of whose womb ca me the ice?\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"or rather \"Out of the womb of Mi came the ice?\" that is the world. Mi therefore is the progenitor of the earth and impregnated it with life and vitality. It was there fore only after the creation that Mi became the subject of thought. p. 152 Again, the word Brashith , what does it signify? Does it mean that \"by two w ords,\" that is, by K equal to \" two \" and rashith equal to \"words,\" Alhim created, or by the word Alhim created, taking Brashith as a single word? The real meaning is that before the creation of the world th ere was no distinction between the Supreme Principl e and the Creative Logos or Word, they being one and the same , and only after creation became they distinguished the one from the other. It is written \"While the King sitte th at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the sme ll thereof\" (Cant. i. 12). The King signifies the Supreme or First Pri nciple, the spikenard sending forth its odor, denot es the creative Word or Logos who is King below having formed the w orld30a-30b on the model or pattern of the world on high and \"the smell thereof\" is the divine light. There were two creations, viz., the heavens and the earth , and they were concomitant in time with each other; the creation o f the former was effected by the right, that of the latter by the left hand, and extended over six celestial days as it is written: \"For in six days the Lord made the heaven s and the earth\" (Ex. xxxi. 17). These six days correspond to the si x outlets through which the waters of life flowed i nto the world and also the six channels by which they return agai n on high. Through the six outlets it is that peace cometh into the world. \"And the earth was Tohu and Bohu , without form and void.\" The constituents of the p rimal matter of the earth at first were impure and shapeless and without form an d continued in this state until, becoming impressed with the Divine name of forty-two letters, they took upon th em different forms, qualities; and separated into t he four elements of fire, air, earth and water. After their purification and combination in different proporti ons, these contributed to the formation of the physical and na tural world, the four cardinal points, and to the i nfinite variety of forms and colors, existent therein and all on the p attern of the higher world. Ere this was accomplish ed and before the Divine name of forty-two letters had been impre ssed upon the primal matter of the earth when in a state of chaos, the great serpent alone and his demon hosts of elemental beings, leaving the chaotic world of Tohu and Bohu penetrated into the higher world to the height of 1 ,500 cubits, but were eventually expelled and hurle d headlong into the abysmal darkness where they abode until the pri mal heavenly light shone upon the earth and dispell ed p. 153 the obscurity in which it was enshrouded, therefore is it written: \"He discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death\" (Job xii . 22). Before the advent of the light, universal darkness prevailed and the waters were congealed so that the earth was without rivers or streams. On the appearance of lig ht, however, they were liquefied by its rays and be came fluidic and the arid earth refreshed by them was rendered f ertile and adapted for vegetable and animal life. T he celestial light of which scripture speaks existed from all et ernity. As soon as it dawned its splendor was visib le from one extremity of the world to the other, but foreseeing that it would he unappreciated and unregarded by m ankind in general, the Divine Being concealed it, so that it should be accessible only to those who walk in the straight and narrow path leading to its discovery and enjoyment. Happy they who find it, for then they become sons of God and children of the Light. \"And God saw the light, that it was good.\" It has b een handed down from our forefathers that dreams in connection with a good object are presages of peace and blessi ngs, especially when letters composing words are se en by the dreamer in their right order and sequence. For inst ance, the letters T, O, bh of the word Tobh seen in their order denote good, so that he who30b sees the initial let ter T may take it as a favorable sigma or token, an d as a synonym of Tab , signifying peace. The numerical value of T, initi al letter of the word T-v-b, is nine and symbolizes the ninth Sephira Malcuth , which receives its light from the first Sephira Kether (crown). The letter V is a symbol of the light proceeding from the first two sephiroth and B is th e symbol of the first sephira and therefore it is t he first letter with which scripture commences, Brashith . Thus each of the letters in this word T-v-b are s ymbols of the three highest sephiroth and designate the just and upright in the world who unite in themselves the heaven and the e arth, therefore it is written: \"Say unto the righteous it is good\" (Is. iii. 10), as the divine light and life dwellet h within them, manifesting as goodness from above and mercy and co mpassion or unselfishness from below as saith scrip ture: \"The lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are ove r all his works\" (Ps. cxlv. 9). In the words \"to al l\" is expressed the prophecy that the day will dawn upon the world when every man's eyes shall be opened and the light he seen by p. 154 all. Such is the mystic meaning of these words. \"Br ashith bra Alhim,\" in the beginning. The occult meaning of these first words of scriptur e is adverted to in the verse: \"When ye come into t he land whither bring you, it shall be when ye eat of the fruit of the land, ye shall offer up as a sheave-offering to the Lord your first fruits\" (Num. xv. 19, 20). The first fruits are a s ymbol of Hochma , the divine wisdom, the first sephira or manifestation of the Divine Being on the earth plan e, and thus may be considered the first fruits. Brashith signifies"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"then, \"by the first fruits,\" and B, its initial let ter, denotes the world watered and refreshed by the mystic river mentioned in the verse: \"And a river went out of Ed en to water the garden\" (Gen. ii. 10). This river, proceeding out of the secret place of the Most High, never ceases to flow down upon the world or the garden, as it is termed. This secret place of its origin or fount is symbolized b y B, the first letter in the book of Genesis. It in cludes in itself all the other letters and symbolizes also the river whi ch gives life to all things. The secret place resem bles a narrow path most difficult to discover and walk therein, yet be studded with many priceless gems. From it proceed t wo great life forces, indicated by the word ha-shamayim (the two heavens) and used in scripture to denote the source of this mystic river. The words that follow after, viz., \" veath haaretzs \" (and the earth) possess a mystical meaning, implying that the mystic river flowing down from th e heavens on to the earth will bring with its water s peace and salvation to mankind, which will in their realizati on be the first fruits when heaven and earth become united and blended together. At the time of creation there was no distinction, n o dark deep gulf or rent between heaven and the ear th.30a-31b When, however, they became separated, the earth fel l into the state of chaos and confusion ( Tohu and Bohu ) and only by the action and silent operation of the heav enly light can they again become united. When the l ight from the right hand of God fell upon the earth, darkness fro m the left hand also went forth and encompassed it. Thus they became blended together, the light being hidden wit hin the darkness. In order, however, that the earth might be blessed and become fertile and fruitbearing, God di vided and separated them, only to unite them again eventually as they are the complement of each other and from the evening and the morning shall be an eternal day. Th ere is no day without night p. 155 and no night without day in this world, and this se quence of the31a great law of the universe (growth and decay, life and death) will endure until the accomplishment and realization of the Psalmist's prophecy: \"The darkn ess and the light shall be both alike\" (Ps. cxxxix. 12). Next: Chapter XIV. A Kabbalistic Symposium by Rabbi Simeon's Students \"A KABBALISTIC SYMPOSIUM BY RABBI SIMEON'S STUDENTS .\" RABBI ELEAZAR spake and said: \"It is written 'the v oice of the Lord is upon the waters.31a The God of glory thundereth, the Lord is upon mighty waters' (Ps. xx lx. 3). These words allude to the celestial river w hose life-giving waters circulate and flow throughout the world and give life and strength to every creature that breat hes and moves upon the face of the earth. 'The God of glory thund ereth' signifies the sephiroth Geburah (power) as expressed in the words, 'but the thunder of his power (Geburah), who can understand?' (Job xxvi . 14). This awful power it is that proceeds from the left side of the sephirotic tree, by and through the God of glory that is on the rig ht side. 'The Lord is upon mighty waters' alludes to the sephiroth Hochma (heavenly wisdom) described as God upon mighty wat ers, that is upon the secret place from which they flow forth, as it is written, 'Thy paths are on the migh ty waters'\" (Ps. lxxvii '19). After this brief interlocution, Rabbi Simeon resume d his discourse find said: \"It is written, Over aga inst the border, shall the rings be for the places of the staves to bear the table' (Ex. xxv. 27). What is the esoteric meaning of the word 'border' p. 157 [paragraph continues] (misghereth)? It refers to the secret place in the tabernacle kept continually closed to everyone except to him whose duty it was to enter therein an d light the lamps. It was therefore called the 'clo sed place' and symbolized the world to come or the hidden and unse en world. The rings here mentioned, of which there were three linked one with the other, signify the sacred chain of the three elements, water, air and fire. The wa ter proceeds from the air, the air from the fire and fire from the wa ter. Thus these elements, though apparently differe nt, are radically the same. 'Places of the staves' denote the modal c ombinations which these elements assume in the vari ous types of things and creatures existent in the universe, the modus operandi , of which, Nature's great secret, is not imparted to a worldly minded man to fathom or understand. He re mains ever in the outer court and is never permitte d to enter her adytum and view the mysteries of the inner temp le or Holy of Holies, inasmuch as the sight only of them would prove fatal to him. And this is why it is written ' the stranger that cometh nigh, shall be put to deat h'\" (Num. i. 51). \"The letter B in the word Brashith is written large r than any other letter in the Pentateuch. What is the reason of this?\" asked Rabbi Jose, \"and what is the esoteric explanation31a-31b of the six days of creation whic h has been handed down by preceding adepts and teachers?\" Replying to these questions, Rabbi Simeon said: \"As in Scripture is found the expression 'The cedars o f Lebanon,' distinguishing them from all other cedars, so the s ix days of creation are separated and characterized especially as the days of Brashith (creation). With reference to these important days the Scripture thus refers to them: Thine Oh"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Lord is the greatness (gedulah), the power (geburah ), and the victory (netzach), for all things in hea ven and earth are thine. Thine is the kingdom (malcuth) and thou art exalted as head above all\" (1 Ch. xxlx. 11). The wo rd \"All\" in this verse signifies the just or the good law which prevails throughout the universe. The targum parap hrases these words thus: \"The All (or the good law) binds togeth er heaven and earth. It is the basis on which the u niverse is built. In heaven it is symbolized by the sephira Tiphereth (harmony or beauty) and in the world by the childr en or sons of light. This is the reason why the Scripture begins with the letter B (the numerical value of which is two) in the word Brashith, B---'two,' rashith--'beginning,' that is to say, p. 158 by the second 'beginning,' or, in other words, by h ochma (wisdom), the second in the first sephirotic triad, and which is the signification given by the targum of Jonatha n Ben Uzziel to this word. Brashith, for though hoc hma is placed second in the manifestation of Ain Soph (the boundl ess One), it is in essence one and the same with Ke ther (the crown), the supernal or higher sephira.31b The sign ification then of the initial words of Scripture, B rashith bra, Alhim (translated in the English version, 'In the b eginning God created'), is this: By hochma (wisdom) , the second manifestation of the Divine, or, in other words, th e Creative Logos or Alhim created the heavens and t he earth. From it proceeded the light which enters as a principle of life into every living existent thing and creatu re, as it is written, 'A river went forth out of Eden to water the garden ,' that is, to prepare and qualify the earth for th e production, growth and development of animated existences. By t he word Alhim is signified the ever-living eternal Alhim. \"Now the words 'bra Alhim' created Alhim seem to in dicate that Brashith, the supreme Alhim or Logos, c reated the lower Alhim. And this is true, for, owing to the ce lestial river from which all life has flowed into t he universe, the first and the third sephiroth, viz.: Kether (crown) and Binah (understanding) in an ineffable manner, becoming united, gave rise or origin to the lower Alhim, who created the world and was thus the proximate sourc e of all life necessary for its subsistence and endurance. To thi s Alhim was entrusted all power, both in heaven and earth, after they had been called into existence. The words 'ath hashamayim' (the heavens) indicate that it was only after the ever-living and eternal Alhim had manifested as hochma the creative Logos that the third manifestation or Logos descended from on high upon the earth. Then it was that the three supreme Logoi became blended and uni fied in the work of creation, and then was it also that the sac red chain of three rings became complete and the re splendent light was manifested on creation as intimated in the word s 'Brashith bra Alhim, ath hashamayim vatha aretz.' In the beginning God designed the world. By the second 'be ginning' (hochma), wisdom, He formed it, and by the third 'beginning' (Binah), understanding, He manifested i t and caused the light to descend from on high upon the world below. I now understand and grasp the esoteric mean ing of the strange enigmatical words, 'Shall the ax e magnify itself against him that heweth therewith' (Is. x. 1 5). It is to the hewer and not to p. 159 the axe that honor must be ascribed, so to the firs t and supreme Logos who created the world by the ot her Alhim, or Logoi, should and ought to be attributed honor and glory.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"This is the interpretation of the mystical words, 'What nation is there so great tha t hath God so nigh unto them as our Jehovah Alhim' (Lord of the A lhim) (Deuter. iv. 7), alluding to the supreme and other Alhim, or Logoi, who were the Pachad whom Isaac the patriarch worshipped and which, tho ugh differing in their manifestations, were one and the same in essence. T he allocution of the words Brashith to the ten seph iroth is as follows: Brashith bra refer to Kether (crown), and Hochma (wisdom), Alhim to Binah, ath to gedulah and geburah, hashamayim to Tiphereth, vath to Netzach, Hod and Yesod and ha-aretz to malcuth. Next: Chapter XV. \"AND God said let there be light and light was.' To whom spake Alhim these words, 'let there be light? ' It was to the dwellers on the earth; but 'light was' refers to th e light made for the world to come. The higher ligh t, the light of the eye was created first by the Holy One who caused Ad am, the protagonist, to behold it so that he was ab le to view the world at a glance. This was the divine light enjoye d by David, who in a moment of spiritual ecstasy ex claimed, 'How great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee' (Ps. xxxvi. 20), and it wa s the self-same light by which God showed Moses the promised land f rom Gilead unto Dan. From the beginning, this divin e light was hidden and concealed, as the Holy One perceived that the generations of men who lived in the time of Enoch and Noah, and also during the building of the tower of Babel, would use it for selfish purposes.

This same divine light is ref erred to by the psalmist. 'Who coverest thyself wit h light as with a garment' (Ps. civ. 2). 'Let there be light and li ght was.' Wherever in the Scripture this word yehe (let there be) is used, it refers to or signifies this divine light, both in this world and the world to come.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The light created by God in the work of creation, filled the world with its splendo r, but was eventually withdrawn and concealed, why? In order t hat transgressors of the good law might not partici pate in it, and therefore the Holy One conceals and preserves i t for the right-doers as it is written, 'Light is s own for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart' (P s. xcvii. 11). When it shall prevail again througho ut the world humanity will become renewed and live the Higher li fe and make it one with angelic life. Till then, ho wever, this divine light is concealed in darkness which is as a covering to it. And this is why God called the lig ht 'Day,' and the darkness He called 'Night,' the one being only a di minution of the other as it is written, 'Light and darkness are both alike to thee. He discovereth deep things out of da rkness'\" (Job xii. 22). Said Rabbi Jose: \"The meaning of those words is thi s, that the great mysteries of life, at present vei led and hidden in darkness, become revealed to the 'Illuminate' or en lightened by the adaptation of their modes of think ing, and thus comprehensible to the human understanding with its limited powers of expression, so that the words of Scripture are realized, 'And the light of the moon shall be as th e light of the sun' (Is. xxi. 26). That this might become actual, there was needed language or audible speech. This speech is that known by the term Sabbath: and because of i ts purity, it is forbidden to give utterance to any idle or profa ne word on that day. This is why Rabbi Simeon used to say to his mother, whenever he heard her speaking on secular a nd profane subjects during the sabbath day, 'Mother , remember it is the holy day and do not indulge in idle disco urse, for that is forbidden!' This form or kind of language it is, that should prevail everywhere because, as it symbolizes the union of the active principle of light with th e passive principle of darkness, it is the only means for giv ing expression and form to the hidden mysteries of life.\" p. 162 Said Rabbi Isaac: \"If this is to be, wherefore is i t then written, 'And God divided the light from the darkness?'\" Rabbi Jose replied: \"In order that light might give rise to day and darkness to night.32a Afterwards H e associated them together and made them as one, wherefore it is written, 'And the evening and the morning were day one (one day) (Gen. i.) the evening, morning and day forming one whole.'\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Until the manifestation of Alhim , the creative Logos, the male principle was in the light, and the female principle, in the darkness. In the work of c reation they became unified, and formed the necessa ry complements of each other. If it be asked, why were they separated and disjoined) it was that there mi ght be a distinction between them; and they became united in order that the true light might be found in its co mplement, the darkness, and the true darkness in its complement, the light. Though at present there are many differe nt shades and degrees between them, yet, notwithstanding, they fo rm but one whole, as it is written, 'Day, one.'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"It is on this union of light an d darkness that the whole universe is based and for med. In Scripture it is referred to and spoken of as a cove nant. Thus it is written, 'If my covenant be not wi th day and night and if I had not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth' (Jer. xxxiii. 25). What is this covenan t? It is the good law of justness, right and harmony, that form the b asis of all existence throughout the universe. The import and mystery of it is expressed in the word zacor (remember). Day and night in their adjustment to e ach other symbolizing the great law of harmony and unity, it follows that it lies as the root of all created exi stence and therefore saith the Scripture, 'but for this covena nt or union between day and night, I should not hav e established the laws and ordinances of heaven and earth,' and which in all worlds throughout the universe form one and the same rule of life.\" Rabbi Simeon again spake and said: \"It is written, 'By the voice of the Mediator or Harmonizer, amongs t those who draw forth water, shall be proclaimed the divine la w of Justness' (Jud. v. 11). The voice of the Media tor (Kol mkhtztzim) here signifies the voice of Jacob, the w ord mkhtztzim being equivalent to ash ha-benaim. 'T hose who draw forth water' are they who draw the water of li fe flowing from an inexhaustible fountain on high, that gives strength and vitality to every animated being. It i s further added, 'and the clemency or goodness p. 163 of God shall be poured in abundance upon Israel, an d the people of God (those who live conformably to the good law) shall appear at the gates.' Israel here signif ies the children of light to whom as a heritage the Holy One has laid up and reserved this divine life forever when they become circumcised in heart, the sine qua non of its enjoyment. When this is not the case, then are realized the wo rds of Scripture, 'They forsook the Lord God of the ir fathers' (Jud. ii. 12). This apostasy lasted until Deborah, the pr ophetess, appeared and led them back into the true path; so that it is said, 'The people willingly offered themselves' (Ju d. v. 2). Furthermore, it is written, 'The inhabita nts of the villages, ceased, they ceased in Israel until that Deborah ar ose, that I arose a mother in Israel' (Jud. v. 7)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"\"What is the esoteric meaning of 'a mother in Israe l?'32a-32b The phrase refers to the celestial mothe r by whom the heavenly waters of life were made to flow into the world, so that the children of light might be stren gthened and established and the true source of it be made known and manifested. This great unknown truth is referr ed to in the words, 'The righteous One hath founded the world' ( Prov. x. 24). The three come forth from the one. On e is in three and stands between two, forming a triad from which has proceeded everything; so that One is all and al l is One; as it is written, 'It was evening and it was morning, day one, for the day, with its evening and morning, is one.' This mystery is further expressed. It is written, 'And G od said let there be a firmament in the midst of th e waters and let it divide the waters from the waters'\" (Gen. i. 6). Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Seven firmaments are there on h igh founded on and governed by the great law of uni versal harmony, of which the Tetragrammaton or sacred name is a symbol. The firmament here mentioned is estab lished in the midst of the waters. It is above the Hayoth or living creatures and divideth the waters above from the waters below and serves as an intermediary between them. W hen the waters below call to the waters above, it i s through it that the latter descend and give life and strength to all creatures as hath been stated. It is written , 'a garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a founta in sealed' (Cant. iv. 12). By 'a garden enclosed' i s meant, the spouse congealed therein, the universal mother of e xisting things, from whom floweth forth the great r iver of the water of life, which if it should cease to flow the waters below would become congealed and infertile. As rivers and streams become p. 164 frozen when the north wind blows, and remain so unt il the south wind comes and dissipates by its warmt h and heat the frost, in like manner, the waters of the river of life do not flow into the world of humanity exce pt under the influence of the life divine. Such is the esoteric meaning of the firmament existing between the highe r and lower regions of life. Scripture saith not, \"let there be made a firmament and let it be placed in the midst of the waters, i.e., between the waters above and those below; for the f irmament here mentioned existed before the beginnin g of the creation of the world and was only placed between t hem, that is, above the Hayoth or living creatures. \" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"In the human body, there exists an organ called the diaphragm, separating the heart from the abdomen, so that what the former receives or takes in is transmitted to the latter. So is it with the firmament in the midst of the waters, or the higher and lower sphere s of existence. What it receives from the higher it transmits to the lower spheres for the maintenance and continuity of human and annual life. There is an allusion to thi s in the words, 'And the veil shall divide between the holy place a nd the holy of Holies'\" (Ex. xxvi. 33). Said Rabbi Abba: \"'Who hideth himself in the waters and maketh the clouds his chariot and walketh upon the wings of the wind' (Ps. civ. 3). By the waters is signifi ed the waters on high by which the house was built, as it is written, 'Through wisdom (hochma), the house is built, and b y understanding (binah) it is established' (Prow. x xiv. 3). 'Who maketh the clouds his chariot.'32b Rabbi Yessa the aged separated the word 'abim' (clouds) into ab (cl oud), and im (ocean), denoting that the darkness proceeded from the left side of the sephirotic tree of creation. ' And walketh upon the wings of the wind' refer to the holy Spirit fro m on high, symbolized by the two golden cherubim pl aced at each end of the mercy-seat, as it is written, 'Thou shal t make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shalt t hou make them' (Ex. xxv. 18). Of these cherubim we also read, 'He rode upon a cherub and did fly, yea, He did fly upo n the wings of the wind' (Ps. xviii. 10). Whilst the manifestation of the Divine is confined and limited to the highe r or heavenly spheres He is said to ride upon a cherub, but after its appearance in the world, then He rides upon th e wings of the wind.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'He weigheth the w aters by measure' (Job xxviii. . .25). These words refer to that just p. 165 proportion or measure of the life principle necessa ry for the development and perfection of all animat ed creatures, and which proceeds from the sephiroth Geburah (Just ice or Justness).\"32b-33a Said Rabbi Abba: \"The ancients relate that when the great teachers descended and came upon earth, they began their meditations on the mysteries of creation by observi ng the strictest silence, impelled thereto by the f ear lest by a single word they should divulge what was revealed t o them and thus subject themselves to condemnation. \" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"At first the initial letter of the alphabet, alternately ascending and descending , impressed on the surface of the lower waters the forms of all the ot her letters, and they became the complement of each other. After the formation of these letters they became the foun dation of the world. Then the waters above mingled with those below, giving rise to the words called Beth (house) . This is why Scripture commences with the letter B in order to teach that the origin of the world is due to the mi ngling and blending of these waters which continued until the firmament which now separates them was established and fixed. This separation took place on the second day of creation and on that day was also created Gehenna, which continues to exist as the place of the devour ing fire reserved for the wicked and wrongdoers.The remainde r of 32a-33b omitted by NdM.

A Symposium of Rabbi Simeon's St udents \"A SYMPOSIUM OF RABBI SIMEON'S STUDENTS.\" IT IS written, \"Let the waters bring forth abundant ly the moving creature that hath life, and let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind\" (Gen. i. 20, 24 ). Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"The waters below, like the waters above, brought forth creatures after their kind and simila r to themselves.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"The waters above sent forth the l iving creatures. What is the meaning of these 'livi ng creatures?' It was the soul of the first human being as it is w ritten, 34a 'And man became a living soul.' It is a lso added, 'and fowl shall fly above the earth,' denoting the angel ic messengers who appear to man in dreams, as also those who manifest themselves in various forms and different aspects. Of these latter it is that Scripture refer s to, 'And a river went out of Eden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads' (Gen. ii, 10). 'And God cr eated great whales (fishes), meaning Leviathan and its female.' 'And every living creature that moveth' in all par ts of the earth. What is this nephesh hayah (living creature)? It was Lilith, the mother of th e elementaries, which the waters brought forth abundantly and ministered to their growth and increase. As when the south wind begins to blow, t he frosts disappear, streams become swollen and rivers flow i n all directions into the seas, so p. 167 was it with these creatures, as it is said: 'There go the ships,34a-34b there is also that Leviathan w hom thou hast made to play therein' (Ps. civ. 26). The words, 'An d every winged fowl after his kind,' signify those creatures of whom it is written; 'For a bird of the air shall ca rry thy voice and those that have wings shall tell the matter'\" (Eccles. x. 26). Said Rabbi Jose: \"All these beings have six wings, never more nor less, and therefore the words 'After his kind' are applied to winged angelic creatures. In their rapid flight through the world they observe and note the actions of men and report them on high, and thence it is written: 'Even in thought, curse not the King and curse not the rich in thy bed chamber'\" (Eccles. x. 20). Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"Scripture here useth the word haromeseth (moving creature) and not hashoretzeth (creeping creature). Wherefore? Because it refers to Lilith, as has been stated, who is also denoted in the word s; 'Thou makest darkness and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do move' (thirmos). These words also in clude and denote those angelic beings called hayoth (living creatures) who predominate and exert an in fluence equalling that of Lilith, and during the three watches of the night chant the ir hymns of praise until the morning dawns. It is o f them that the prophet Isaiah speaks; 'They who remember the Lord and keep not silence'\" (Is. lxii. 6). Here Rabbi Simeon rose up and spake: \"After long an d protracted meditation on the origin of mankind, I have gathered that when the Holy One wished to create ma n, all the worlds throughout the universe were grea tly affected and disturbed until the sixth day, when the divine will and intention became realized. Then the supern al light of all lights shone forth in its glory and splendor issuin g from the gate of the east, spreading and envelopi ng the whole world with a garment of ineffable brightness, truly magnificent and indescribable. \"Then spake the great Kosmocrator of the east to hi s fellow rulers over the other quarters of the worl d: 'Let us make man in our image' that he may he receptive and enjo y the effulgent glory of the light that is streamin g forth and enlightening the whole world. Then became conjoined the east with the west, engendering and bringing f orth man on that part of the earth whereon the Holy Temple w as afterwards founded and built. According to anoth er ancient tradition the meaning of the words, 'Let us make ma n,' is given thus. The Holy One spake and made p. 168 known to the angels the mystery and occult signific ation of the word Adam (man), the letters of which indicate his relation to both worlds, the seen and unseen, the k nown and unknown. By the letter M,34b-35a which is written as a final or closed mem, is found thus contrary to rule in the word lemarbeh , occuring in the verse, 'Of the increase of his government' (Is. ix. 7). Man is connected with the higher world, whilst daleth or the letter D, cl osed on the west side, indicates his relation to the lower and sensi ble world. The principles of which these letters ar e the symbols ultimated in their manifestation on the phenomenal plane of existence and the production of a blended and harmonious whole, viz., of man in the form of male and female until the Lord God caused a deep sleep t o fall upon him (Gen. ii. 21). The Holy One then separated them and having clothed the latter in a form most fair and beautiful brought her to man, as a bride is adorned and led t o the bridegroom. Scripture states that He took one of the sides or parts (of the androgynous form) and filled up the p lace with flesh in its stead. In a very ancient occ ult book we have found it stated that what God took from the side of Adam was not a rib but Lilith, who had cohabited w ith him and given birth to offspring. She was however an unsuit able helpmeet for Adam and therefore Scripture stat es, 'But for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for him' (Gen. ii. 20). After the disappearance of Lilith and Adam 's descent into the world plane of existence, then it was, as stated, 'The Lord God said, It is not good that man should be alone, I will make him a helpmeet for him.'\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"On another occasion Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"I t is written, 'And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb in the field before it grew, for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth' (Gen. ii. 5). By the phrase, 'Every plant of the field' is me ant the preexisting ideal forms of great forest tre es before their actual appearance in the world. Note that Adam and Eve were at first created androgynous. Wherefore we re they not created face to face, or separated individuals? Bec ause, as Scripture states, 'The Lord God had not ca used it to rain upon the earth.' The union of man and wife is a typ e of a great spiritual fact, viz., the union of hea ven and earth which could not be accomplished until the rain whic h united them descended. Then Adam and Eve ceased t o be androgynous and gazed into each other's faces, as is the case with heaven and earth, the one reflecting the image of the other. If it be asked: p. 169 whence or how do we know that things above are form ed and modelled after things below; we say, from th e mystical signification of the words; 'And the Taber nacle was reared up' (Ex. xl. 17), meaning the heav enly tabernacle which existed not until the earthly tabe rnacle had been erected. This is why the scripture states, 'And there was no man,' that is, until the creation of E ve, man was an imperfect being; which fact is indic ated occultly by the absence of the letter Samech (denoting aid, hel p) in every passage relating to the creation of wom an. Although members of the celestial college--those that have b een initiated and enlightened in the secret doctrin e--affirm that the word ' Ezer ' (help) denotes that woman was created to be a hel p to man, she became so only when from androgynes they because separated and thus able to behold each other face to face.35a This is occultly referred to in the words; 'They are brought together forever and a re made in truth and uprightness' (Ps. cxi. 8). By the term 'brought together' is meant that the union of male and female whose coming together is for mutual help , will continue even in the supernal worlds forever. 'For the Lord God had not yet caused it to rain upon the earth' signifies that complete and perfect union between man and wom an did not then exist because it had not as yet bec ome a fact in the natural world, for it is added; 'And a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face o f the ground' (Gen. ii. 6), which refers to the sexual desires ex perienced by the female towards the male. Mists ris e at first from the earth, heavenwards and, after forming clouds, h eaven causes them to descend and water the earth. T his applies also to the offering up of sacrifices, the smoke an d fume of which ascending on high are caused to des cend in blessings on mankind. If the congregation of Israel had not first offered up sacrifices, blessings wou ld never have been showered upon tine world.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"Wherefore is it written, 'And the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tr ee of knowledge of good and evil?' We learn from tradition that the height of the tree of life attained to 1,825,000 m iles and from its root flowed forth all the waters of creation in the ir various directions and courses. The celestial ri ver, after refreshing the garden of Eden with its perfumed and crystallin e waters, descends on to the earth below for the su stentation and refreshment of every living creature on the earth, as it is written, 'He sendeth the springs into the valleys , which run among the hills. They give drink to every beast p. 170 of the field, the wild asses quench their thirst' ( Ps. civ. 10, 11), 'And the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.' Wherefore was it not planted in the midst of the ga rden and what is the mystical meaning of this tree? Its nature or essence was two-fold, being bitter or sweet, accord ing to the character of those who take and appropri ate its fruits. Those who are selfish find that what they thought g ood, becomes evil to them. Thus many are seduced an d go astray from the path of rectitude, and therefore is it cal led 'the tree of knowledge of good and evil.' When man ceased to be androgynous and became separated as at present male and female, it is said, 'And He closed up the fles h in its stead' (Gen. ii. 21),35a-35b in which words occurs the let ter S or Samech (help). The Holy One, like the judicious ga rdener transplanting trees and flowers, after sundering th e two forms, placed them where they could behold ea ch other face to face and thus begin on their course of physical and spiritual development and perfection. Furthermo re, how know we that such was the origin of man and woman as at present constituted? Because it is written, 'The br anches of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glori fied' (Is. lx. 21). 'The work of my hands' refers t o a special formation that should characterize man from other c reatures. It is also written, 'In the day thou plan test, thy seed shall only produce wild fruits' (Is. xvii. 11). We are taught that plants, like the fragile wings of l ocusts or grasshoppers, are void of color. It is only after a ttaining to full growth that they become distinguis hed and conspicuous by variety of form, shape and color, su ch as the cedars of Lebanon. It was the same with t he protagonists Adam and Eve, for, as plants before transplantatio n, so was it with them. They did not become perfect until they were transplanted onto the earth plane. It is also written, 'And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat, for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die' (Gen. ii. 16, 17). From tradition we learn that th e word tzav (commanded) denotes idolatry in general, the name L ord or Jehovah refers to blaspheming the holy name, whilst Alhim or God indicates the denial of justice in the world.

In saying, 'From every tree of the garden t hou mayst eat' God indicated that even if man shoul d commit all these sins, he was not to despair. Thus p. 171 we see that the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jaco b, and also prophets, have eaten of it and died not at once. He wished to warn man against tasting of the tree of d eath, as it is written, 'but of the tree of knowled ge of good and evil eat thou not of it, for whoever does so dies as if he had taken poison.' 'But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,' God has commanded, 'We should not eat.' 'The fruit of the tree' denotes the woma n. Thou shalt not eat thereof, because as scripture states, 'Her feet go down to death and her steps lead into Hades ' (Prov. v. 5). There is fruit that is salutary when gathered from one tree and lethal when plucked from another tree. This latter was the fruit Eve referred to, viz., that of the tree o f death and is described by the words of scripture just quoted. \"It is written, 'Now the serpent was more subtle th an any beast of the field which the Lord God had ma de'\" (Gen. iii. 1). Said Rabbi Jose: \"The tree of which we have bee n discoursing was nourished by supernal light, by w hich it became great, fair and beautiful to the light. It i s also written, 'And a river went forth out of Eden to water the garden.' The garden here mentioned denotes the fema le, whom the river made fruitful. Then man and woma n became again one, in the sense as it is said, 'Jeho vah is one and his name is one.' After disobeying t he divine commandment, a deterioration in their heavenly stat e took place and they became separated from the hig her and diviner life as intimated by the words, 'And from t hence, it (the river), was parted'\" (Gen. ii. 10). Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The serpent of which scripture s peaks is The Tempter.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"It was a real serpent.\" Going t o Rabbi Simeon and making known to him their differ ent views, he replied: \"Your interpretations are really one and the same a nd are both correct. Samael, when he descended on t he earth plane,35b rode on a serpent. When he appeared under the serpentine form, he is called Satan. Whatever his name, he is the being known as the spirit of evil. It is sai d that when Samael descended from on high as just d escribed, all the other animals fled away frightened and terrified. B y his persuasive and guileful words, he deceived the woman and thus caused death to enter into the world (that is, the lower nature then ceased to be amenable to and obey the dictates and supremacy of the higher Self). He succ eeded in doing this by means of the Sephira Hochma (wisdom), prostituting and using it for his evil purposes and thus caused the world p. 172 to become accurst, and the tree which the Holy One had planted to become destroyed. What man lost Sama el gained and enjoyed until the apparition of another sacred tree in the person of Jacob, who, by means of wisdo m, acquired paternal blessings which neither Samael on high nor Esau below should be able to enjoy. He was therefo re an after type of the first man; and here we see that as Sama el deprived man of blessings proceeding from the fi rst tree, so Jacob deprived Samael of blessings above and below proceeding from a tree having a human form. This is the mystic meaning of the words, 'And there wrestled a man with him' (Gen. xxxii. 24). 'The serpent was mo re subtle than any beast of the field.' These words refer to the Tempter, the angel that brought death into the world, and knowing this, we can understand the meaning of scri pture, 'And God said unto Noah, the end of all fles h is come before me' (Gen. vi. 13). The angel of death having destroyed the divine life in man, who now had beco me wholly physical , governed and controlled by his animal or lower na ture, and therefore dead and impervious to the heav enly influence of the Higher Self. \"And he said unto the woman, Yea, (aph) hath God sa id, ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden?\" (Gen. iii. 1). Said Rabbi Jose: \"The serpent began his discourse w ith aph (poison) and thus cast it into the world. W hat he said was this, 'By this tree the Holy One created the wo rld,35b-36a eat ye therefore of it and become equal to Alhim and able to distinguish between good and evil.'\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Not so spake the serpent, for t hen he would have spoken truly and the tree would h ave been recognized as the means by which, like a tool in th e hands of an artisan, the Holy One had formed the world. What he really meant and did say was this, 'The Holy One himself has eaten of this tree and was thus able t o create the world. Do ye therefore eat of it and ye will also h ave power to do the same as He. Alhim knows this an d hence his prohibition.'\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The words of the serpent were a tissue of falsehoods. At first he said, 'Yea hath A lhim said, ye shall not eat of the tree?' He knew well that God h ad said, 'From every tree of the garden thou mayest eat.'\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Tradition states that this comman d of God related to the sin of idolatry, denoted by the word 'commanded,' to blasphemy, by the name Jehovah, the denial of divine justice, by that of 'Alhim,' by t he word 'Adam,' the crime of p. 173"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"murder, and fornication, by the words 'said unto hi m.'

This be ing so, we purpose to show that the same principle or law that operated in the creation of the physical world, ope rated also in the origin of man, and that both alik e are manifestations of one and the same law. That this g reat fact may be more fully perceived, let us first consider the esoteric meaning of the words, \"But they, like Adam , have transgressed the covenant, there have they d ealt treacherously against me\" (Hos. vi. 7). When the Holy One created man he invested him with a form so transcendently glorious and perfect in it s proportions, and with mental endowments so great, t hat all other creatures trembled and stood in awe a t his presence amongst them; for on his visage he bore the imprint or reflection of the Divine, their p. 175 creator. Furthermore, the Holy One placed him in th e garden of Eden, that there he might enjoy the ple asures and delights of angelic existence. In this beautiful ab ode, angels came round about him and made obeisance to him and revealed unto him their occult knowledge respecting the Divine Being, whom they regarded and worshiped as The Lord God of the universe, in order that he might un ite and join them in His worship and service. Instr ucted in and taught the most profound celestial secrets, man bec ame initiated in the mystery of wisdom (hochma), th e first of the Sephiroth, in order that he might become imbued wit h an adequate idea and conception of the honor and glory due unto his maker. In the invisible world, (or heaven, Devachan), ther e are seven spheres or states of existence, in whic h operate all those principles of life and existence which can on ly be matters of faith to the generality of mankind as at present constituted. Corresponding to them there are seven spheres or states, appertaining to and surrounding the lower world of humanity. Of these seven spheres, six can be apprehended by the human mind and only by those initiated into the highest mysteries. As the lower spheres be longing to the terrestrial world are formed after t he pattern of those of the celestial world, the highest of the te rrestrial spheres which comes between them is that which was at first designed by The Holy One as the abode and dwe lling place of man in his primeval state of purity and sinlessness. After his expulsion from this Edenic s phere of existence, it became reserved by His Creat or for the souls of the righteous in which they might enjoy the happ iness of the beatific vision, or divine presence, a nd take on them the form and appearance of Adam before his fall."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE FIRST, of these seven lower terrestrial spheres , is that from which proceeds an influence that pre pares and qualifies dwellers on the earth plane to acquire a state of perfection, approximate and similar to tha t which distinguishes angelic beings. In it are found gathe red together students of the Good Law, engaged in t he study of that secret wisdom and doctrine that is never imparted e xcept to just, upright and unselfish souls, who are admitted therein that they may enjoy a knowledge both of hea ven and earth, and thus be better able to meditate on Divine mysteries and become receptive of heavenly delights and enjoyments. It is altogether invisible to ordi nary human perception and the way of access to it unknown and undiscoverable save to p. 176 those who, amidst the afflictions and distress atte ndant on earth life, render a faithful obedience to the Divine law. It is written, \"A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband\" (Prow. xii. 4), in which words there is an occult reference to this sphere which as stated is a subje ct of faith and not of sight. A man ought therefore always to cleave unto and be faithful unto the Divine within him or his Higher Self and never deviate either to the rig ht or left from its dictates and injunctions through menace or fear which in scripture is termed \"the adulterous woman or a woman of fornications.\" Therefore is it written: \"Say unt o Wisdom, thou art my sister, and call understandin g (binah) thy kinswoman, that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words\" (Prow. vii. 4, 5). In this sphere also are gathered the souls of those who have commenced on the upwar d track or path to the Higher Life, for when they quit and go out of earth life, they rest and abide in it for a period more or lese prolonged, and necessary to prepare them for ascens ion into the higher or celestial Eden. In each of the lower spheres are found souls in var ious and different states of progression each array ed in garments and vestments corresponding thereto in brightness a nd color which they continue to wear until they att ain unto the angelic state of existence, when they are discarded and thrown away. Ere this however takes place they enjoy the privilege of beholding the denizens of the higher c elestial spheres and contemplating the glory of the ir Lord. Here are found those who, though heathen by birth, embra ced and conformed their lives to the good law and f rom them emanates an aura, so bright that when they ascend, they become invisible to beholders. This sphere is more splendid and glittering than gold or precious stones. Throug h an opening on one side of it glimpses are obtaine d of the miserable state and unhappy condition of the inmate s of Gehenna or Avitchi, into which they have been hurled by destroying angels, because in earth life they were rebels and disobedient to the good law. Through thi s same opening, a beam of celestial light penetrates into their dark abode three times daily, when for a shor t period they enjoy an assuagement of their misery and pain. Agai n, in this first sphere are upright proselytes such as Obadiah and Onkelos, who are held in honor above others. When a ny inmate is judged worthy to ascend into a higher sphere he retains the rank that distinguished him from his fe llows. p. 177 THE SECOND SPHERE is more interior than the first a nd is the abode and resting place of the fathers of humanity. It is illuminated by a light of many variegated col ored rays descending from on high and its effulgenc e is far beyond that emitted by the most glittering diamonds. In it dwell those who were tormented and afflicted in th e world yet renounced they not their worship of and trust in Th e Divine, nor ceased in their service to humanity. There too are those who, at all times and with all their power an d strength, hallowed the divine Name, their daily p rayer being, \"Let His great name be blessed forever and ever.\" T hese, dwelling more in the centre of his sphere, ar e more recipient of the light by which it is illuminated a nd are better able to catch glimpses of higher and more supernal rays of light which, singly or in combination, flas h down from the next higher sphere where abides the Messiah, who occasionally descends in their midst in order t o direct and guide them in the path of ascension. THE THIRD SPHERE; in it are assembled those who in earth life were subjects of great suffering and gri evous trials, also those who died in early childhood. Her e also are those who mourned and sorrowed over the destruction of the Holy Temple and are consoled and strengthened b y the Messiah, so that eventually they ascend into the glory and Light of THE FOURTH SPHERE, which includes those who mourned over the destruction of Jerusalem and were slain b y idolatrous nations. When beholding them, and thinki ng over the miseries they endured, the Messiah weep s sympathetic tears so that the chiefs of the house o f David gather round him in order to share in and t hus mitigate his sorrow. In it the Messiah abides and dwells and in the time of the new moon his cry ceases not until i t is responded to by the voice divine from on high. When he descen ds and visits the lower spheres, he is girded with garments of dazzling light, the sheen of which radiates in all directions, imparting renewed vigor and energy to t hose who died and suffered grievously for his sake. Ere he ascend s again he arrays himself in a purple robe into whi ch are woven the names of those who were slaughtered by idolater s for and which, after he ascends, are transcribed and impressed on the purple robe of the great king; and there com eth a time, when the Holy One will envelop Himself with it and judge the nations as it is written: \"He shall judge amongst the heathen\" (Ps. ex. 6). Ere, however, th is comes to pass, the Messiah with an aureole of light, and"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"p. 178 accompanied with hosts of angels in their chariots, visits his martyrs to console and comfort there. W ithin this same sphere live and dwell the ten famed Rabbis of Israe l, Rabbi Akiba and his associates together with oth ers who all acquire here the faculty of beholding the reflectio n of that transcendently Divine light that no morta l can approach unto, of which it is written: \"No eye but thine, oh God, has seen it\" (Is. lxiv. 3). THE FIFTH SPHERE includes all those souls who in ea rth life repented of their evil ways and attained a state of purity, and with them are those who sacrificed their lives for the glory and honor of God. At its entrance sits Manasseh. the king of Judah, whose repentance The H oly One graciously accepted and restored unto him H is divine favor. Here also are they who deeply regretted thei r deeds of selfishness and evil ere they died, and now enjoy along with the rest, its joys and delights. There comes a time when the celestial light descends from the sp here above, filling every one with that degree of happiness of which he is receptive. It is a sphere of joy so exa lted and great, that even the souls of just men made perfect are unable, through its intensity, to enter and abide therein, those servants of the Divine who had attained to the unitive stage in the Higher Life being only admitted into it and oc cupy the highest rank. THE SIXTH SPHERE is the peculiar abode of these lat ter and of the most exalted of divine and holy men and women whose love for their Lord proved itself true and lasting. At its entrance are all those who proc laimed the word of the Lord and when the time of ascending hig her comes they are the first. At another entry, Abr aham, the right hand of the Holy One, is found, and there too is Isaac who was hound upon the altar as a perfect offering unto the Most High. At the third entry is Jacob, surroun ded by the chiefs of the twelve tribes each with th e halo of the divine Shekina encircling their heads. When the chi ldren of Israel suffer affliction, all these patria rchs are likewise afflicted and implore the Shekina to protect them, which then descends and places a crown over Israel that defends them from all trials and troubles. All these six sp heres are variously connected with each other. THE SEVENTH SPHERE is the complement of all the oth ers and, being the most central, its existence is a subject of faith and not of knowledge to human beings. In t his most secret and most interior of the spheres is a most magnificent column of light of many colors, green, white, red and black predominating. Each p. 179 soul, at the end of each incarnation on earth ascen ds for a moment into this sphere, and, according to the color that he first beholds, so is he located in the sphere co rresponding to it. The mystery of these six spheres is expressed in the word Sheth (six) and occultly alluded to in the first word of holy scripture, Brashith, bra, shith , He created six lower spheres and their corresponding higher antety pes, both being included in this word Brashith. Said Rabbi Jehuda: There were two temples, the firs t and the second; one above and one below and one t he type of the other, so in the Divine name I H V H there are two H's. The letter Beth (B) hath this peculiarity. It represents a house, which is its meaning, with a door or way of entrance that in whatever way it is turned, remains open, therefore, is this letter the gate to the scripture s and in a mystical sense symbolizes Him who is janua vitae , the gate of life. Said Rabbi Isaac: It has been said by Rabbi Eliezar that Brashith synthesises the universe and everyth ing contained in it, and as such is referred to in scripture. \"Th is was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord\" (Ez. I. 28). It was the likeness in which was contained tha t of six others. The word Brashith may thus be inte rpreted and rendered, bra, shith, that is to say, after the for m of brashith, God created six other worlds or sphe res of existence. Rabbi Jose spake and said: It is written: \"The flow ers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the turtle dove is heard in our land\" (Cant. ii . 12). The occult meaning of the word flowers, refe rs to the six higher and lower spheres; \"appear on the earth,\" re fer to their representatives, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob , Jachin, Boaz, and Joseph; \"the time of the singing of birds,\" den otes the worship and glory rendered by man to the D ivine Being after attaining to a knowledge of these spheres, as scripture saith, \"that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent\" (Ps. xxx. 12); therefore is it that the Psa lm containing these words, is termed mizmor (a song), which term is applied only to those psalms that David composed un der the direct inspiration of the Divine Shekina. Next: Chapter XVIII. Higher Devachanic or Heavenly Spheres HIGHER DEVACHANIC OR HEAVENLY SPHERES. SAID Rabbi Abbi: \"The higher or celestial world wit h its accompanying spheres, though invisible to mor tal sight, has its reflection and analogue, namely, the lower world with its circumambient spheres, according to the saying, 'As above, so below.' The works of the Holy One in the celestial world are the type of those in the terres trial world. The meaning of the words,45a Brashith, bara Alhim is th is: brasahith, i.e., the celestial world, gave rise or origin to Alhim, the visible divine name that then first beca me known. Thus Alhim was associated with the creati on of the world, as Brashith was connected with the creation of the celestial or invisible world, that being the type, thus the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"antetype, or in other words, one was the reflection and analogue of the other, and therefore it is wri tten, 'Ath hashamayim, veath ha-aretzs' (the heavens and the e arth). The heaven on high produced and gave rise to the earth below.\" It is written, \"And the earth was without form and void\" (Tohu va Bohu). The signification of these wo rds has already been given. The word aretzs here refers to the earth in its primal state when void of light. B y the word \"was,\" scripture teaches that it existed at its cre ation in a state of chaos and confusion. It is also said \"and darkness,\" which was the deprivation of the light emanating fr om the antetypal world, owing to the matter of the earth becoming condensed and thus less receptive p. 181 of its reflection. NdM p. 181-197 omitted from Sonc ino These words, Tohu, Bohu and darkness, together with a fourth, \" wind ,\" represent the four elements composing the substa nce of the earth. Another version gives \"ve-ath ha- aretzs,\" referring to this world and its several di visions that are altogether different from those of the celestial world and which are as follows: Aretzs, Gia, Nesia, Zia, Arga and Thebel, which latter is greater than all t he others as it is written: \"And He shall judge the world (Thebel) in righteousness\" (Ps. x. 9). Rabbi Jose having asked the question: \"What kind of world is that which is called Zia?\" Rabbi Simeon r eplied: \"It is the place of Gehenna or Hell, 'a land of dra ught and of the shadow of death' (Jer. ii, 1). It i s mystically referred to in the words, 'and darkness was upon the face of the deep' (Gen. i, 2), alluding to Zia, the abode of Hell and of the Angel of death, and is so called because the faces of those who are banished there become blackened on account of their wicked lives when on earth. The earth of Nesi a is that the inhabitants of which become oblivious of the past; whereas, in that of Bohu, the faculty of memory is vivid and active.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"The word Bohu denotes the earth, Gia, whilst the words, 'and the spirit of Alhim mov ed upon the face of the waters,' designate that of Thebel, whic h is nourished and sustained by the spirit of Alhim , as is also Aretzs, our own abode of earthly existence, which i s circumscribed and surrounded by seven spheres ana logous to those of the celestial world, all of them being und er the domination and control of their particular l ords and guardians. The seven spheres of the celestial world are prototypes of those that surround our world an d are inhabited by angelic beings who sing the praises of the Holy One, and use their own individual forms of worship. Their rank and order are indicated by the sphere they occupy. \"The first of these higher or celestial spheres and nearest to the earth, is altogether void of light and is the abode of angels who are like tempestuous winds, never seen, but felt, and are always invisible as they are void of light and darkness and undistinguished by any color. They are wholly without self-consciousness and without form or shape. Its chief and ruler is an angel named Tahariel , who has under him seventy subordinates. Their mot ion is manifested by the glittering of fiery sparks, the appearance a nd disappearance of which constitute day and night. p. 182 \"The second celestial sphere is distinguished from the first by the possession of a modicum of light, and is inhabited by angels appointed to watch over humanity and guid e it into the path of uprightness whenever there is danger of its falling into error and wrong doing. When righteousn ess prevails in the world, they are filled with joy and delight. Their chief and ruler is called Qadmiel . When Israel commences its worship of the Holy One , they then manifest and make themselves visible in forms of intense brightn ess, and three times daily they bless and hallow th e divine name. When they observe Israel studying and meditating on the law or secret doctrine, they ascend on high be fore the Holy One, who takes account of what they have seen and h eard. \"The third celestial sphere is pervaded and filled with fire and flames. In it the fiery river Nahar dinur takes its rise and flows into Gehenna, overwhelming and engulphing in its course those mortals whose lives on earth w ere given up and addicted to evil and wrongdoing. Over these are placed destroying and tormenting angels, also a ccusing angels who, however, have no power or influence ove r Israel when it repents and does what is just and right. The abode of their chief is on the left side of this sp here in which darkness prevails, as it is written, 'and darkness was upon the face of the waters.' It is also the abode of Samael, the angel of darkness, the great transgr essor. \"The Fourth celestial region is splendidly luminous , being the abode of angelic beings of great honor and dignity who, unlike those of the first sphere, begin and fi nish their worship of the Holy One without interrup tion. They are not subject to any change or declension, being ange ls of mercy and compassion of whom scripture speaks 'Who maketh his angels as the wind, and his messengers a s flames of fire' (Ps. civ. 4). Their great mission work is on the plane of human existence and are invisible save in visions of the night, or on extraordinary occasions according to the degree of intelligence of those to whom they ma nifest themselves. Their great chief is named Padiel by whose orders they hold the key and open the gates of merc y through which pass the prayers and supplications of those who sincerely repent and live the Higher and Diviner li fe."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"\"The Fifth celestial sphere is one of still greater and more intense light. Therein are angels, some o f them ruling over fire, others over water, and are messengers either of mercy or judgment, and as such become manifested as heralds of light or p. 183 darkness. Their worship of the Holy One takes place at midnight. They are under the control of a chief named Qadashiel. When at midnight the north wind begins t o blow, the Holy One, blessed be He! enters the gar den of Eden and holds converse with the righteous. Then begin t hey their service of praise which resounds througho ut the whole of this sphere and lasts during the night until day break and the sun appears. At that moment these ang els join in a grand and glorious song of thanksgiving that peals also from all the hosts of heaven, from angels and archangels, seraphim, cherubim, above and below all uniting in the ascription of blessing and honor, glory and pow er to Jehovah, the Lord of Hosts that liveth forever and ever; as it is written, 'When the morning stars san g together and all the sons of God shouted for joy' (Job. xxxviii. 7). This their great anthem ceases not until Israe l begins its song of praise. \"The Sixth celestial Sphere is nearer to the Kingdo m of heaven. In it are seas covered with ships, als o rivers and lakes abounding in fish. Its denizens are under the rule of presidents, the chief of whom is named Uriel , who enter on their official duties at certain fixed times. Wh en the time arrives for the ships to go south, Mich ael is their ruler; and when they go north, Gabriel assumes authority a nd direction; as these two archangels occupy the ri ght and left sides of the Mercaba, or celestial chariot. When, h owever, the ships go eastward, Raphael rules, and Uriel when they sail westward. \"The Seventh Celestial Sphere is the highest and ac cessible only to souls of the greatest purity and t hus qualified to enter into its joys and delights. None other are fo und there. In it are laid up treasures of peace, bl essings and benefits. \"All these seven spheres are inhabited and filled w ith beings like in their form to man, who cease not to worship and give thanks to the holy One. None of them, however, are so conversant with the glory of the Holy One a s the inhabitants of the sphere of Thebel, who are perfec tly pure in body, mind and soul. In the seventh cel estial sphere there are those who have attained to the highest de gree of holiness as in the seventh sphere belonging to earth below, are found the just with purified bodies. Moreover, above and beyond all these spheres there are seven others the existence of which is a subject of faith and not of experience, and in each of them are spiritual bein gs of the highest order. \"The first of these mysterious spheres is inhabited by a p. 184 lofty angel named Rachmiel , who has the charge over those who have forsaken i dolatry to become worshippers of the Holy One. By him they are prepared to look in t he Luminous Mirror, or Beatific Vision. \"In the second higher sphere dwells Ahinael , who receives under his care all who died ere bein g initiated in the secret doctrine, and instructs them in its teaching s. \"The third is that where abides Adrahinael , a spirit under whose care and guardianship are th ose who in earth life had resolved to change their evil habits, but being suddenly overtaken by death, were unable to do as they had willed. Such souls find themselves cast first into Gehenna, out of which, however, they are taken by t his spirit and prepared for the enjoyment of the divine light eman ating from their Lord and Creator, the Holy One. Th e joys of such souls are inferior to those of others. They ar e known as 'children of the flesh,' and of them it is written, 'From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to an other, shall all flesh come to worship before me, s aith the Lord' (Is. lxvi. 23). \"The fourth of the spheres is inhabited by a spirit named Gadrihael , presiding over all those who were slain by idolaters.

Rabbi Simeon's Discourse on Pray er RABBI SIMEON'S DISCOURSE ON PRAYER. RABBI SIMEON said: \"Who is he that knoweth how to a ddress his prayers to the Almighty as did Moses in all the circumstances of his life, whether long or brief in their duration. We have found in an ancient book, that prayer, in order that it may become effective and enter throug h heaven's gates without hindrance or obstacle, sho uld be expressed in terms suitable and corresponding to ex istent circumstance, otherwise it is ineffective an d of no avail. Blessed are they who learn and acquire the true sec ret of prayer, by which they succeed in obtaining t hrough the Schekina their requests, and those blessings by whi ch evils are assuaged or averted and judgment becom es tempered with mercy.\" For a few moments, Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking and then, as one inspired, he slowly rose and standing up, exclaimed: \"Who can utter the mighty a cts of the Lord, who can show forth all his praise and teach us the mystery and secret of prayer, but Abraham the p atriarch sitting now on the right hand of God? He c an tell us, he to whom were revealed in raptured vision the glorio us mansions of the Great King. Seven are they in nu mber and each with their entrances, through which the prayer s of mankind may ascend up to the throne of the Ete rnal from the lips of those whose souls are in harmony and union with the Lord of the universe, who embraces worlds above and below with his love and regards them as a glorious whole. Such souls are they of whom scripture speaks , 'when trouble came they visited thee, and p. 186 poured out their prayer when thy chastening was upo n them' (Is. xxvi. 16). \"The first of these sacred mansions is referred to in the words, 'And they saw the God of Israel and t here was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire st one, like unto heaven in its clearness' (Ex. xxiv. 10). Its existence is the greatest of mysteries. It is the abode of a gre at spirit named Saphira whose radiant form is white and in its brilliancy like unto the precious sapphire stone. T he light of this mansion sendeth forth rays in two directions, glittering and flashing like sparks from a candle, and though apparently separate and distinct, yet ar e they but emanations and scintillations of the one divine lig ht; as it is written, 'like the color of burnished brass' (Hz. i. 7). This spirit Saphira is stationed on the right side of th e mansion whilst on the left is stationed another s pirit whose color is red and named Lebanah . The rays of these two spirits become blended and mingled together, the red absorbing the white as the cows of Pharash, of whom we read that when the lean had eaten up the fat kine it could no t be discerned that they had eaten them (Gen. lxi. 20). There are two gateways to this mansion leading to the sphere termed 'the heaven of heavens.' \"From the emanations of these two spirits, Saphira and Lebanah , are created and formed those angelic beings calle d Ophanim , who in their holiness are accounted equal to the Hayoth , or living creatures, described by the prophet (Ezechiel i. 20). The appearance of the Ophanim was like unto the color of Beryl, but that of the Hayo th was like that of coals of burning fire and amidst them were fiery flames, glittering and scintillating like spa rks, referring to the Holy Spirit from whom they all emanate and by w hom they shine as it is further written, 'and the l iving creatures went and returned as the appearance of flashing lig htning.' When a spirit becomes united and blended w ith another, there flashes forth above the four Ophanim a great white and dazzling light, each of whom takes the fo rm of a lion with the wings of an eagle and rules over a thousan d and three hundred myriads of subordinate spirits like unto themselves. \"These Ophanim form the wheels of the heavenly Merc aba, or chariot, by whom it is moved in four direct ions. In each wheel of his chariot appear the three differen t colors of the supreme light, thus twelve altogeth er. These Ophanim also constitute the four mystic beings of t he Divine Chariot having the forms of a man, a lion , an ox and an eagle, facing the four p. 187 quarters, but when the wheels of the chariot begin moving, they become faced to each other, as it is w ritten. The loops held together each to each' (Ex. xxxvi. 12). At the time that the wheels begin moving, a voice s weet and harmonious is heard resounding by the dwellers in t he lower world. The light emanating from this mansi on is perceived by angels extending to the star Sabathai (Saturn), and is a source of nourishment and suste ntation to all who behold it as it is written, 'Everywhere is the spirit, and wherever it went the wheels also went, for the spirit of the living creatures, or life, was in the wheels.' (Ez. i. 20). Some behold this light bright and ebul lient as the rays of the sun reflected in clear water, by others it is p erceived blended with the light of Lebanah ."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"\"Blessed is he who by the intensity of his prayer i s able to ascend into this mansion for, then by the exercise and performance of rites and ceremonies that symbolize union with the Divine and the oneness of the living spirit, his soul becomes filled with a heavenly joy, and he is encircled by a bright aura by which he is led to th e silent contemplation of the mysteries of the second mansio n. By the prayers of such souls, the four Ophanim b ecome as one, and blended together as fire with water, and w ater with fire, as the North with the South and the South with the North, and also as the East with the West and the W est with the East. Such is the power of a just man' s prayer to accomplish the union of opposites; so that the huma n becomes Divine, and the Divine is blended with th e human, which union is symbolized by a tall lofty column of light that extends and reaches from the lowest to the highest spheres, attracting the attention and regards of al l spirits inhabiting there and by their meditation becoming united with the Divine Spirit as it is written, 'They have all one breath' (Eccles. iii. 16) that is one and the same indwelling spirit. The Second Mansion is that alluded to in scripture, \"like to heaven itself in brightness\" (Ez. xxiv. 1 8) and is the abode of an angelic being termed Zohar (splendor) w ho in the luminous brightness of his form, is ever the same and changeth not. The light in this mansion is transcen dently white and illumines it in all directions. Ha ppy the lot of those to whom it becomes visible. With the spirit Z ohar is associated another, the color of whose aura resembles that of the hyacinth more than the pearl or diamond and causes the light of this mansion to be more pronoun ced and noticeable by its contrast. From this light p. 188 emanate the Seraphim , heavenly things having six wings according to the number of the mansion which is the sixth from the highest. It is they who consume up all tho se who have no respect nor regard for the worship a nd glory of their Lord and they are therefore termed \"Consumers .\" The mystery attending their office and service i s referred to in an ancient tradition that states, dasthmsh btga chlph , i.e., whoever makes a selfish use of the Crown, t hus profaning it shall be consumed. He, however, who st udies Scripture and the six orders of the Mishnah i s as he who by reverential worship becomes unified with his Lor d. To all such, the Seraphim become adjustants by c onsuming in their flames all the descendants of the great Serpe nt by whom death entered into the world. These sera phim are under the government and authority of the presiding spirit of the mansion, When the wheels of the Merc aba or heavenly chariot begin moving, they fall back and m any of them are consumed in their own flames, but e ventually they are resuscitated and, gaining their pristine s tate, take refuge beneath the wing of the eagle, on e of the four living creatures surrounding the Divine chariot. When the divine light is seen beaming within the four living creatures, each of the wheels begin moving. The wheel belongin g to the East, in moving in that direction becomes hampered by the other three, turning each in their own direc tion. This occurs alike with the other wheels of th e North, South and West. Only when their individual motions are eq uilibrated, can the Divine chariot be raised and tu rned in any direction by the mystical Column of light that unit es the higher and lower spheres. This same Column, according as the chariot is at rest or in motion, closes or open s the gate of prayers. Next: Chapter XX. Devachanic Spheres and Mansions. \"DEVACHANIC SPHERES AND MANSIONS.\" In the third mansion or higher sphere is the spirit Nogah (splendor), whose aura is of the most absolu te whiteness and purity and without a shade of color, by reason of which it takes its name. It is altogether invisi ble to the lower spheres except when tempered and blended with the r ays that proceed from them. The light of this mansi on is most wonderfully manifested in the appearance of a great and mighty sheaf of fire, emitting sparks of twent y-two different shades of color, corresponding to the twe nty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This lumino us sheaf, however, remains invisible and undistinguished unti l p. 189 the time that prayers ascend from the lower spheres , when all these star-like sparks become united and form a column of light and give rise and origin to holy an d powerful Hayoth or living creatures that separate themselves into two groups, one having the form of a lion, the other, that of au ox. Above these are seen the fou r Ophanim or wheel-like spiritual beings, under whose rule and c ontrol are myriads upon myriads of subordinate spir its. Each of these Ophanim has eight wings and derives its power and sustenance from the Hayoth above them and are stationed at the four cardinal points of the world. Each have four figures or forms, two of which are turned tow ards the Hayoth and two are covered by their wings, that they may n ot behold the Mercaba or celestial chariot in its c ircular motions, and thus avoid being consumed and annihilated. Thei r reverence and veneration of the Divine Being give rise to unnumbered hosts and legions of angelic beings who chant praises and sing hymns continually to his hon or and glory. To this mansion there are four entrances and gateways, corresponding to the four quarters of th e world, and each of them guarded by ten chiefs. When prayers as cend from the lower mansions and spheres these gate s are"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"opened, when a general blending and fusion takes pl ace, of chiefs with chiefs. Ophanim with Hayoth and Hayoth with Ophanim, of angelic hosts and legions with oth er hosts and legions, of lights with lights, and sp irits with spirits, all blended together become at length unified with Nogah, the ruling spirit of the mansion, into one m ighty, harmonious whole. In this mansion is a place glitte ring and shining like burnished brass, wherein are vast hosts of angels who are unable to go out therefrom and ascen d on high until this mansion becomes united by pray er with the next higher or fourth mansion. These particular hosts of angels are the executive messengers of Karmic law and sent forth by the chie f justice of the tribunal in the fourth mansion. They are termed Generals because they lead their hosts against nations and inhabitants of the world who violate the good law o f right and justice. On the sixty walls of their ab ode they suspend their shields of gold, in number six hundred thousa nd, are entering into the fourth mansion from which when they return they descend into the lower worlds and spher es as far as the planet Mars, in order to execute t he decrees and sentences entrusted unto them. Here they remain unt il the time of prayer, which ascends on high from p. 190 the lower spheres, when they blend and mingle with the angelic messengers of mercy and goodness, and, together with them, enter into the great effulgent column of light beaming down from on high, and ascend into t he fourth mansion. Happy he who understands and comprehends t he mystery of this column by which he comes into un ion with the Divine, thus escaping all affliction and b ecoming participant of the blessings conveyed and i mparted to him by these Karmic angels. He is verily the just man, and a world upholder, for his prayers are always ef fective and prevail with heaven, whence he receives his recompe nse and becomes enrolled amongst the children of li ght. Take note that all these spheres and mansions with their living creatures, their legions of angels and all their spirits of light, are coordinate and bound together and lin ked by indispensable and indissoluble ties, and as the coats and parts of the eye are necessary and essential for si ght, each of them being unable to operate without t he aid of the other, working together in perfect harmony, so is i t with all these angels and spirits. But for the ma ny gradations in their orders, prayer would be unable to ascend on h igh and become effectual. By this series of gradati ons it is that prayers proceeding from the throne find an entry in to the fourth mansion and attain to that degree of holiness which distinguishes true worship and adoration of the Div ine Being. The fifth mansion varies from all others in that it is a combination of four mansions, one within the other. Its president spirit is called Zacouth (righteousness) and rules over those who by their lives and deeds have become justified. Out of this mansion go forth seventy lig ht rays corresponding to the number of the chiefs t hat guard its gates, who, along with two others, constitute a san hedrim to which Karmic angels and spirits bring and submit their reports of human action on the earth plane. These t wo superior rays are known as \" the witness .\" The mystery respecting them, their existence and office, is ind icated in the words, \"Thy belly is as a heap of whe at, set round about with lilies\" (Cant. vii. 2). By these seventy light beings, all actions are weighed and each man adjudged. On their decisions becoming ratified by the two witnes ses, they are carried out, executed by Karmic minis ters whether for good or otherwise, and this is why this mansion is termed Zacouth, whose president bears the impre ss of the letters of the divine name, I. H. V. joined togethe r similar to the juncture of the male p. 191 and female and give forth a light that illuminates all sides of the mansion, and also three other rays corresponding to the three judges necessary to constitute a legal tr ibunal. Their jurisdiction extends to all questions and matters relating to wealth and poverty, sickness and health . Myriads of angels attend to receive their decisio ns and forthwith proceed to execute them throughout the world. Above this tribunal are seated four flaming Seraphi m from whom stream forth seventy-two bright and shi ning rays corresponding and similar to those before mentioned . Beneath them flows a fiery river that consumes ev eryone that approaches it. In it are thrown and consumed those angels who in any way incur condign punishment. It never flows into the fourth mansion because of the letters I. H . V. borne by the president, for wherever they are visible no punishment can he inflicted. All decrees, whether f or good or otherwise, affecting mundane affairs, go forth from the mansion, saving those relative to fecundity, wh ich are adjudicated on in the higher mansion. In th e middle of it exists a place where assemble all spirits ascending from lower spheres. This mansion has also twelve gateways at which are stationed chiefs, who make known to their subordina tes the decrees and mandates they have to discharge and exe cute in the world, as it is written, \"He cried alou d and said thus; Hew down the tree and cut off his branches, shake o ff his leaves and scatter his fruits\" (Dan. iv. 14) . Having received their orders, these Karmic angels speed th eir flight to the firmament of the Sun, and when it rises despatch them to all quarters of the world to be executed by demons and elementals of fire, air, earth and wate r, as also by birds and other creatures. Until they are carried o ut they return not to their abode on high. In this same mansion, when anyone in the world beco mes ill, it is determined whether and when he shall recover or die. It may be asked: How so? We have just said tha t decrees relating to life and death are not in the jurisdiction of"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the mansion. This is truly so. Though the sentence be decreed in it, the final fiat is given from abov e and is invariably conformable to it. Happy he who attains unto union with the Divine, for then his prayers ri se on high and return with the blessings from the mansion symboliz ed by prostration of the face upon the ground at th e time of prayer, an attitude by which we supplicate that jud gment may be tempered with mercy as it is written, \"He is a p. 192 [paragraph continues] God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He\" (Deuter. xxxii. 4). The fifth mansion is the abode of a spirit named Beraqa (lightning) because the light reflected by it upon the lower spheres is similar to lightning, purple hued in color. It is a combinatio n of different colored rays, such as white, black, red and green, yet to sight they appear as one. Beneath it, stand four Ophanim with faces turned to the four cardinal poi nts and each with its own peculiar color. In proportion as these Ophanim approach and come into contact with one an other, so do their colors become fused and blended the one with the other. When this occurs their forms become visi ble within each other, as it is written, \"An Ophanim in the mi dst of an Ophanim\" (Ez. i. 16). The various colors prevailing in this mansion are due to the flaming sword mentioned in scripture, \"He placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword\" (Gen. iii. 24). Next: Chapter XXI. THIS sword is suspended over the judges presiding i n the fourth mansion and is alluded to in an old sa ying, \"Let every judge when delivering judgment remember, that the sword is suspended above his own head.\" It is continually turning and when the Ophanim become fused together, two fiery rays proceed from it and going outside t he mansion, station themselves before the gate thereof , taking the form of a man and a woman. At other ti mes they appear as spirits or as superior angels. The male r ay characterizes angels engaged on missions of merc y and goodness in the world, therefore need they the inte nse light of the male form; whereas, those angels w ho as to their form have been consumed, need the light of the fema le form, on their reappearance. The spirits presidi ng in these two lights become united at the time of prayer. The force that produces this union is the affection of Love and when it is effected the name of this mansion becomes cha nged from Beraqa into Ahabah (love), for in it is accomplished the union of all beings by their common love to the Supreme Being, of which scripture speaks, \"There w ill I give thee my love\" (Cant. vii. 12). Furthermore, when th ese two rays become blended, there spring forth and become manifested unnumbered myriads of angelic beings met aphorically named, Manchakes , Raisins and Pomegranates , whose plane of existence lies between the fifth man sion and the planet Venus. Thus it is written, \"A m an would give all his substance for Ahabah\" (love) (Cant. viii. 7 ); that is, to draw to himself angels from this pal ace so named, but they would not be induced to leave it. This mansion is symbolized in the act of prayer, by prostration of the body, with extended hands indicative of the desire to bec ome united by love with the Divine. p. 193 p. 194 The sixth mansion is presided over by a spirit name d Khute Hashne (threads of scarlet) and is occultly alluded to in the words, \"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet\" (Cant. iv. 3). It is also termed, the mansion of as piration and is that which angels of the lower spheres ardently desire t o attain unto and become united with in spirit by t he nesheqath rakhunutha (the kiss of love), who is in intimate relationshi p with all the lower spheres. Another reason why th is mansion is so called, is, that everyone who succeed s in coming into relation with it attracts to himse lf divine energy from on high through the unitive power of love. In this mansion is Moses who died by a kiss of this lo ve and it is therefore called by his name. Its presiding spirit is a spark of love and unifies the lights of the hi gher and lower spheres and makes them one, when sparks flashing ou t of it give rise and form to living creatures holy through goodness and love and are therefore called the GREA T HAYOTH and enter into union with those of the low er spheres similar to the husk and shell of a nut, as it is written, \"Hayoth great and small\" (Ps. civ. 2 5). It is for this reason it is termed Zanath Egoz (the garden of nuts) and is so referred to in scri pture, \"I went down into the garden of nuts\" (Cant. vi. 11), i.e., into this mansion of love in order to unite the male and female princip les. These Hayoth are divided into twelve, and trios of them are stat ioned at the four gateways, and on them are depende nt all inferior spirits so that throughout the whole of the spheres concatenation of all the various grades and orders of beings, all dependent one upon the other and forming a grand fa mily of spirits throughout the universe from which is formed a mighty angelic spirit who ascends on high to adore and worship the Supreme Spirit and become united wi th it. This union of spirits with the Divine is occultly allude d to in the words, \"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth\" (Cant. i. 2); that is, with the kiss of love expres sion of the universal ecstasy and the eternal delig ht experienced by every animated being in its union with the Divine, by which partially developed spirits become eventua lly perfect and spirits in darkness become illumined with the l ight proceeding from the eternal Spirit, supreme ov er all. And this is effected by prayer coming from a sincere an d loving heart. Happy he who prays, so that these s pheres and mansions and their indwelling spirits become united together in love and thus able to climb the ladder whose top rests on the throne of the Eternal. The mystery of this mansion of love is"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"p. 195 alluded to in scripture, \"And Jacob kissed Rachel\" (Gen. xxiv. 11). Abraham, who is on the right hand of the Most High, is the president of this mansion. Ahabah, his great aim having been to confirm himself with the divine will, hence his words: \"Behold, I know now that thou art beautiful\" (Gen. xii. 11). Now the beauty of a woman is her breast, the seat o f love. Isaac, who is on the left hand, presides ov er the Beth Din or tribunal of Justice, whence are issued decrees a nd judgments. He attained to union with the Divine through the spirit of Zacouth (righteousness). The other prophe ts preside in the mansions of Nogah and Zohar and a re mystically indicated in the words, \"The joints of thy thighs a re like jewels\" (Cant. vii. I). Joseph, the just and pillar of the world, presides in the beautiful mansion of Saphira which is of gre at beauty and splendor, notwithstanding the words of scripture th at allude to it, \"Under his feet\" (Ex. xxiv. 10), t hat are written to enhance the divine glory. It is through this mansio n that spirits, by means of the shining column of l ight, ascend into the seventh, the most mysterious of all, and here a s radii in a circle converging to the centre; so in it spirits from all spheres ascend and form a vast united family in per fect and eternal union with the Divine, which is re ferred to and indicated in the words, \"Jehovah is Alhim, Jehovah is Alhim\" (I Kings, xviii. 39). Blessed in this lif e and in the world to come are they who are able to attain unto this union, symbolized by the bending of the knees in the act of prayer and adoration, together with prostration of the body, extension of the arms and hands and abase ment of the face on the ground, these gestures indicating their desire to become conjoined and unified with the Su preme Spirit, the Soul of all souls, the infinite and eternal Bei ng, primal fount of all light and blessing. When this glorious union is accomplished and consum mated, of worlds below with worlds on high, earth a nd heaven will become conjoined in the Divine life and then will judgment be changed into mercy and goodn ess and the Divine will be done on earth as it is in heaven , as it is written \"And He said unto me, 'Oh Israel thou art my servant in whom I will be glorified'\" (Is. xlix. 3) . Happy the people whose \"God is the Lord\" (Ps. cxl ix. 15). Next: Chapter XXII. THE seventh mansion is without visible form, being the highest and most mysterious of all, enshrouded with a veil which separates it from all other spheres and mansi ons, so that no one can perceive the two Cherubim s tanding behind it and therefore it is termed The Holy of Ho lies, for therein is the, Supreme Spirit that impar ts life and light to all creatures. When the union of all spirits wit h the Divine takes place, then the light of this ma nsion descends out of the Holy Place and illuminates all worlds. All l ight coming down from on high is like the seed of m an that unites the male and female, and so is it with this mansion which unites the higher with the lower spheres. Ha ppy the man who accomplishes this union, for then is he wholly blessed and beloved both on high and below. When th e Holy One decrees judgments such a man is able to appease and allay them and yet does not act contrary and i n opposition by so doing, but through his intimate union with th e Divine Being all penal judgments and decrees beco me self annulled and innocuous. Oh blessed is he both in th is world and the world to come; as it is written, \" The righteous man is the foundation of the world\" (Prov. x. 25). Whilst he lives a voice from on high is ever speaki ng unto him, saying: \"Thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel\" (Is. xli. 16). p. 197 As the chief priest officiates at the altar of sacr ifice and the Levites chant, the cloud of incense a scends on high; so is the ascent of spirits to the higher spheres and man sions, until at length they become unified with the light of light, and abide forever, perfected and wholly divine thro ugh the power of prayer. It is then that all spirit s like lesser lights are blended with the great divine light, and enteri ng within the veil of the Holy of Holies are overwh elmed with blessings proceeding therefrom as water out of an i nexhaustible and ever-flowing fountain. In this man sion is the great Mystery of Mysteries, the deepest, most profo und and beyond all human comprehension and understa nding, the eternal and infinite Will, that governs, sways and rules all worlds throughout the universe, the m ighty causal Will, known only by its effects and silent operatio ns, and that through all ages to come will ever act until the human and divine wills are blended together in one eterna lly harmonious whole, and humanity attains to the H igher and Diviner Life. Blessed are they who have entered int o the enjoyment accruing from this union of wills a s it is written, \"Thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she wh o hath born thee shall rejoice\" (Prov. xxiii. 25). When perfect union prevails, everything is centered in and proce eds from the Divine Thought or Mind. All forms and ideas give place to and disappear in the Divine Mind, that alo ne animates, vivifies, sustains and enlightens ever y human soul. The supreme Will, residing and acting through pure thought, it follows that by prayer man effects this union with the Divine Will and attracts it to himself, and therefo re it is written, \"Happy is that people who enjoy t his greatest of blessings, whose God is the Lord,\" for then the wor ld rejoices in mercy and goodness that come from ab ove, through the prayer of union, which never proves in vain or resultless. It avails with the Lords as that of a c hild with its father and is answered.

It ordains and the Holy One fulfills its behests, as it is written, \"Thou shalt desire a th ing and it shall be established, and the Light shall shine upon thy way \" (Job xxii. 28). 1 Footnotes 197:1 Note by translator. These mansions in their totali ty correspond to the third heaven mentioned by St. Paul in the Epistle to the Corinthians. The reader will fin d some very interesting information on these sphere s and mansions in the works of St. Dionysius the Areopagite. He wi ll also find a very interesting reference to the \"t wo witnesses\" in Revelation, XI, 1, pointing to the Kabbalistic orig in of this book. Next: Chapter XXIII. p. 198 SAID Rabbi Isaac: \"It is written, 'And God said, le t there45b-46a be light.' (Gen. 1-3). This was the primeval light that illuminated the world on all sides and which t he Holy One withdrew and hid, that it might not be enjoyed save by the righteous--\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"By the words, 'And God saw the light that it was good' is signified that the divin e light in itself is a source of joy and delight; the word 'good' bei ng the same used in connection with Balaam, thus, ' When Balaam saw that it pleased,' in that it was both (good) in the eyes of the Lord to bless Israel' (Num. 24-1); and therefore at the end of the verse, 'And God divided the light fr om the darkness' in order that the upright might li ve in the light and the wicked in darkness. Note that it is from th is primal celestial light emanates the light which shineth and illumes the world and becomes a source of joy to ev ery living creature. It was with this higher light that the Holy One with his right hand formed and engraved crowns as we have formerly described. It is written, 'How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which Thou hast wrought for them that trust in Thee, before the sons of men.' (Ps. 31-19.) 'How great is thy goodness' refers to the primal light the Holy One hid and reserved for them that fear him, even the righteous in life. It is written, 'and the evening and the m orning were day, one.' The evening arises out of darkness and the mo rning from light and from the conjunction the day i s formed.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Wherefore is it written of each day, 'It was evening and it was morning?' It was t o show that there is no day without night, and no night without day and therefore are not to be separated.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"'The primal celestial light of th e first day is that which lightened the other days of creation,' and therefore the word YOUR day is repeated.\" p. 199 Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"For the same reason, the scrip ture uses the word boqer (morning) in connection wi th all the days of creation, as it designates the primal light .\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"The first day of the creation i s the synthesis of all the other days, for as there is really no separate fractional moment in time, they only forme d part of the whole. It is written, 'God said let t here be light' meaning angelic beings who are emanations from the light on high that shineth forth on the world below and were created on the first day and took up their position on the right hand of the Holy One. 'And God saw th e light that it was good.' The word ath before good, refers to the luminous and non-luminous mirror, the one 'being th e light by which the Beatific Vision is acquired by prophets, the other that which enlightens the mind of man for the perception of truth.\"46a Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"The word ath indicates that in the light that God called good, are comprehended a nd included all the angelic hosts that emanated from it and als o when perfect harmony prevails amongst all orders of beings, will regain their pristine splendor.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"It is written, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,' by which is meant the interior man who is receptive of the knowledge of spiritual truths (the waters above), and of earthly things or scientifics (the waters below).\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"On the second day, Gehenna was f ormed whilst the work of creation was yet incomplet e; the term 'good' is not applied and used until the third day, when it is repeated twice, as then all discor d and clashing of elements ceased and the lot of the wicked in Gehenn a became alleviated through the decreased intensity of its fiery heat. Wherefore the second day is considered an inc omplete period until junction with its complement, the third day, took place.\" Rabbi Hiya was sitting before Rabbi Simeon and said : \"Light coming from the right appeared on the firs t day, but darkness from the left attended with division of th e waters and discord amongst the primary elements, why did not the first day contain and make up what was wanting in the second?\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Simeon: \"Because as there existed no har mony between the first and the second day, the thir d was necessary to equilibrate them and cause union betwe en them. It is written, 'Let the earth bring forth. ' It was by the green herb that p. 200 the waters above and below had become blended and m ade fruitful, representing thus the union of male a nd female principles, therefore is it true that what is above is as what is below.'\"46a-46b Said Rabbi Jose: \"That being so, there must be a Go d above and a corresponding God below: If you affir m this, I should say that the God on high is called the livin g God, whilst the God below is Ahhim, designated in scripture by the term toldoth (productions), as it is written, t hese are the products of the heavens and the earth which are created (Behibaram). Now we learn from the secret doctrine that this peculiar word should be divided and read thus, behi- baram; meaning that God created the heavens and the earth by He. Now He who is above is the universal Father, who created all beings. He made fruitful the earth so that it brought forth toldoth (products), in the same way that the female is made fruitful by the male.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"All the fructifying powers were present in the earth, potentially, at the time of its creation, but only. became manifested in the various productions of the six days; as it is written, 'And God said le t the earth bring forth the living creature.' If, however, it be said , the words of the scripture are 'Let the earth bri ng forth grass,' our reply is that the earth from the third day was then imbued with generative forces that remained dorman t and hidden until the appointed time for manifestation. The ear th was void and empty, as it is affirmed, of all li fe, as the targum renders the meaning of the words 'tohu vabohu,' but it became adapted for the reception of those gener ative forces necessary in the production of grass, herbs and tre es, that manifested their existence on the sixth da y. This was the same with the light created on the first day of cre ation, but did not become visible only at the appoi nted time, viz., on the third day. It is written, 'Let there be ligh ts in the firmament of Heaven.' The word Meoroth (l ight) is here written defectively, indicating by this that the ev il serpent is the author and originator of discord and separation of what should always be united and blended harmonious ly together viz., the sun and the moon. This word a lso denotes the malediction by which, through the serpent, the earth became cursed, as it is written, 'Cursed is t he ground because of thee' (Gen. 3-17), and being found in th e singular, signifies that the moon, designated by the words, 'Let there be light,' and the sun by the words, 'In the firmament,' were originally created together and fo rmed one, in order to give their united light upon the earth, p. 201 but through the serpent they became separated; henc e it is written, 'Let them be for lights in the fir mament of the Heaven,' to give light upon the earth, instead of ' Let them enlighten the earth,' and therefore we con clude that both in heaven above and on earth below, time is measured b y the courses of the moon.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"By the moon's courses, the sols tices and days are reckoned and determined.\" Rabbi Eleazar objected to this statement and said: \"Is not frequent mention made of fractions of time in the world on high?\" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"Only in the angelic wo rld is there no need of the lunar courses as elemen ts for calculating time, and when any mention is made of t hem it is by way of accommodation to the understand ing of the dwellers on earth.\"46b Again Rabbi Eleazar made objection and said: \"It is however written, 'Let them be for signs and season s,'Gen. 1:14 that is, for the measurement of time, and these wor ds being in the plural, we may infer that they appl y to both worlds having the same unit of measure.\" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"The word othoth (signs ) is written defectively to show that divisions of time exist not in the world above as in the world below.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"Why then is it written, 'Let t hem be for signs and for seasons,' and from which w e may gather that the sun and moon together were to be used for this purpose that the moon is only needed.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"The moon is designated by a plu ral term, as it resembles a casket filled with vari ous jewels that is ofttime spoken of in the plural. Observe that ev ery numerical calculation begins with unity, whatev er its value and worth may be or whatever it represents. Now the Div ine Unit is that in which everything is included an d therefore beyond and above all mathematical calculation. It i s the basic unit from which all things in the world take their origin and beginning, and its analogy in the phenom enal material world is the moon, which is the base of all calculations in connection with the solstices, feas ts, sabbaths; and therefore it is that Israel, who belongs to the Holy One, begins the division of time from the various p hases and aspects of the moon, symbol of the divine point or unit; and therefore it is written, 'Ye are attached or jo ined unto the Lord your God' (Deuter 4-4). It is wr itten, 'And God said p. 202 let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving cr eature that has life' (Gen. 1-20).\""},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"The occult meaning of these wo rds has already been unfolded. They refer to the wa ters below that signify the lights above, which are both alike fruitful and generative, 'and fowl that may fly ab ove the earth.' Why is it not written, 'who fly?'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"The esoteric meaning of the wor d bird refers to the archangel, Michael, as it is w ritten, 'And one of the seraphim flew towards me' (Is. 6-6). The word 'fly' refers occultly to Gabriel, as scriptur e saith, 'And the man Gabriel which I saw at first in vision, being c aused to fly swiftly' (Dan. 9-21). The words 'above the earth' refer to the prophet Elijah who descends from on high, re aches the earth in four flights or steps; of him it is written, 'The spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not' (Kings 18-12). The first step is indicated by the words 'The spirit of the Lord,' the second by 'shall carry,' t he third by 'whither,' and the fourth by 'I know no t.' Moreover, the scripture adds, 'in the open firmament of heaven,' referring to the angel of death who, as we learn fr om tradition, is sometimes on earth and sometimes present in heaven, to seduce and tempt men or accuse them of their mi sdeeds.\" Said Rabbi Abba in reply: \"The angel of death was c reated on the second day,46b-47a whilst the words j ust expounded are written of the fifth day. The fact is that the angel Raphael, who is appointed to heal t he earth of its evil and affliction and the maladies of mankind, wa s created on the second day; the words, 'In the ope n firmament' denote the angel Uriel, as indicated by the words t hat follow, 'And God created great whales or fishes .'\" Said Rabbi Eleazar, \"The words 'great fishes' refer to the seventy rulers appointed to rule over the s eventy nations of the world, but the words 'Every living creature tha t moveth' signify Israel whose souls (nephesh) proc eed from 'hahaya' (the living), and therefore is it that in scripture they are termed, 'The only nation or peop le.' The words, 'Which the waters brought forth abundantly after th eir kind,' signify those who devote themselves to t he study of the secret doctrine. 'And every winged fowl after his k ind,' are the righteous in Israel, because they are really 'The living creatures' (living the higher life). Another exposi tion of these words explains them as referring to t he messenger angels sent on earth.\" Next: Chapter XXIV. Further Kabbalistic Expositions of the Six Days Of Creation FURTHER KABBALISTIC EXPOSITIONS OF THE SIX DAYS OF CREATION. SAID Rabbi Abba: \"'Nephesh hahaya' (living soul) tr uly denote the souls of Israel. They are the childr en of the Holy One and holy in his sight, but the souls of the hea then and idolatrous nations whence come they?\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"They emanate from the left side of the se phirotic tree of life, which is the side of impurit y, and therefore they defile all that come into contact with them. I t is written, 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, and creeping thing and beast of the earth aft er his kind' (Gen. 1-24). Wherefore does the word ' lemina' (after his kind) occur twice? It is to confirm what has ju st been stated, that the souls of Israel are pure a nd holy, but the souls of the heathen being impure and unholy are sy mbolized by the creeping thing and beast of the ear th, and therefore, like the foreskin in circumcision, are cut off. It is written also, 'Let us make man in47a our image and after our likeness,' indicating that in man exist forces and powers coming in all directions from on high, w hich by 'hochma' (wisdom) will finally attain their culmina tion within him. The words 'Let us make man' includ e and contain the mystery of the male and female principles, of w hich every act and function is effected by supreme wisdom. 'In our image and after our likeness,' denote the digni ty of man, as he alone amongst the animal creation is a complete unit in himself and is thus able to rule over all c reatures below him. 'And God saw everything that he had made and it was very good.' Here scripture supplies, what wa s not said of the second day, the term 'good' not b eing affirmed of it, because on the second day death was created. If it be asked, was it necessary that God should p. 204 see everything he made before pronouncing it to be good? The47a answer is that God being omniscient kn ows all things and to him the past and the future are as th e present; the past with its countless generations of men and the future enfolding everything that shall be in the co urse of ages to come, and this is the meaning invol ved in the above words, for everything created and made by God canno t but be good. The scripture adds, 'And it was even ing and it was morning the sixth day.' Why is it that the defi nite article is joined to this day and not to the o thers? Because when the creation of the world was completed and fi nished, the union of male and female principles was established, through the letter H and therefore it is said, 'The heaven and the earth were finished' (Gen. 2-1), ha ving become harmonious to each other.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"It is written, 'How great is t hy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that f ear Thee' (Ps. 31-19). Remark, that the Holy One created and place d man in the world, so that by an upright life and service he might attain to and enjoy the heavenly light that h as been laid up for righteous souls, of which it is said from the beginning of the world, 'men have not heard, nor he ard by the ear, neither hath the eye seen Oh God! w hat thou hast"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"prepared for them that trust in Thee' (Is. 64-3). H ow can we attain unto this heavenly light of the hi gher life? Only by the study and the knowledge of the secret doctri ne, for he only who meditates therein, conforming a nd fashioning his life to its teachings, attains unto it and beco mes regarded as though he had created a world or a new life, as it was by the secret doctrine creation originated and by i t still subsists, as it is written, 'The Lord by wi sdom (hochma) hath founded the earth and established the heavens by un derstanding (hinah) (Prov. Ill-19); and further it is said, 'I was with him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him' (Prow. 8 -30). These words signify that whoever makes the study of the s ecret doctrine his delight contributes to the welfa re and subsistence of the world, for the spirit by which t he Holy One created and still sustains the universe is the same that operates in the hearts and minds of all true studen ts of the higher life, as also of young learners. ' How great is Thy goodness' refers to the special good or blessing th e Holy One has reserved for them that fear Him, and scripture adds, 'Which Thou hast wrought for them that trust in Thee before p. 205 children of men.' What is the meaning of the words 'Which Thou hast wrought?' They refer to the work o f creation.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"They refer also to the Garden of Eden, the Holy One planted on earth after the patte rn of the celestial paradise, for the just to dwell therein, and therefore it is written, 'Which Thou hast wroug ht for them.' There are, therefore, two paradises, one heavenly, the ot her earthly.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"The scripture certainly speaks of a celestial paradise, and with reference to the words 'before the children or sons of men,' they mean that those who delighted in the worship and service of their L ord will dwell therein., The words, 'The heavens and the earth' de note the written and unwritten or traditional law. 'And all their host' refer to the expositions and commentaries on them, amounting in number to seventy. The words, 'w ere finished' designate the union of these, the one bei ng complementary to the other. Whilst, 'with all th eir hosts or constellations' refer to the divers interpretations of these laws, as also to things lawful and non-pe rmissible. 'And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had mad e,' these words signify the traditional law, which is the foundation of the world. 'The work which he has mad e'; it is not said, 'all his work,' because the wri tten law which emanated through hochma (wisdom) was not included i n it. Therefore is the term 'seventh day' repeated three times, (1) 'And on the seventh day God finished,' (2) 'and God rested on the seventh day,' (3) 'and God bless ed the seventh day.' The first has reference to the traditional la w, containing the mysteries of creation, the second , the foundation of the world. In the book of Rah Yeba, the aged and ve nerable, this also refers to the Jubilee and is the refore followed by the words 'from all his works,' for from the sec ond day everything was produced and brought forth. The third expression relates to the high priest who blesses a ll the world and has the preeminence in all things, as we learn from tradition that in all offerings the high priest rec eives the principal part.\"47a-47b Said Rabbi Jose, the aged: \"The two words, 'seventh day,' denotes the basis of the world and the middl e column of the sephirotic tree of life, whilst the words, 'and sanctified' show the place of the temple; as it is written, 'and shew me it and his habitation' (2 Sam. 15-25). Therein r eside and abide all the saints above, and thence co mes the sweet delicious bread which is p. 206 the delight of the congregation of Israel, as it is written, 'Out of Asher, his bread shall be fat and be the delight of kings' (Gen, 49-20), signifying that from Asher47b shall come forth the covenant of peace and the brea d of the poor shall become 'lechem panneg' what kings (viz., the congregation of Israel) delight in as a dainty. It is from this abode on high come all joys and delights and everything r egarded as Holy and sacred in the world, there 'He hallowed it' (vayikadesh otho), oth here meaning the covenant; ' because in it He rested, 'therefore, on the seventh day, every creature above and below rests also, 'from all his work Asher bra Alhim lausoth, which Alhim created a nd made.' We know that the injunction 'remember ye' leads to obedience, that the creative work may become perfec ted, and the meaning of these words is that God created the good law that through study of and obedience to it, man might attain to perfection.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"It is written, 'Who keepeth cov enant and mercy with them that love Him and keep Hi s commandments, to a thousand generations' (Deuter 7- 9). Deut. 5:10 The words, 'who keepeth' refer to th e congregation of Israel, while 'covenant' designated the foundation of the world, but 'mercy' here mean s Abraham. Thus all the works of God were wrought to be a bene fit and blessing to every one of his creatures, abo ve and below, to all souls, together with elementals and demons. If it be said these latter are no blessing to the w orld, our answer is that every created thing or creature hath its prope r use, and this is so with elementals and demons, f or they act as the executors of karmic law on criminals and wrong doer s and transgressors. Next: Chapter XXV. p. 207"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"REMARK what is said of Solomon, 'And if he act unju stly I will chastise him with the rod of men and wi th47b-48a the stripes of the children of men.' (II Sam. vii. 3). What mean the stripes of the children of men? T hey are the elementals or demons. Furthermore, at the time of t he creation of the world and when the sabbath appea red, there were spiritual beings who had not as yet become inc arnated in a body. They emanated from the left side and had nothing in common with those that came forth from t he right side of the sephirotic tree of life, as th ey were the residuum of created beings and so are incomplete an d undeveloped creatures with out the impress of the divine name before which they quake and tremble and flee a way. It should be remembered that every man is inco mplete who does not beget and leave a son behind him in th e world, and is not impressed with the divine signa ture of the Holy Name and does not ascend into the vestibule of paradise. Like a tree uprooted and that must be re planted in order to grow and bear fruit, so must he become rei ncarnated in order to bear the complete Holy Name w hich is never impressed on anything that is imperfect. Obse rve also, of these unembodied beings some are in th e world above and some in the nether world, and because the y are unincarnated they can never accord either wit h angels or human beings. \"If it be asked, how is it that those above are imp erfect seeing they are all pure spirits? the reply is, whether above or below, they are only partially developed owing to t heir derivation from the left side of the tree of l ife. Though invisible to man, yet are they continually around a nd about him for his hurt. They have three things i n common with angels and three in common with human beings, as st ated before. After the creation p. 208 and apparition of these imperfect elementals, they remained hidden48a and concealed in abysmal darknes s during the evening and morning of the sabbath, and when it ended they came forth and entered into the world a nd are now to be found everywhere. In order that mankind might be protected from the assaults of these spirits of the left side, Gehenna with its fire and flame was created. These elemental beings ardently desire to become incarnat ed, but are unable to do so. We ought therefore to take care an d guard and protect ourselves from their influence by use of the prayer in the liturgy for the warding off their aff lictions. \"Observe that the canopy of peace was extended over the world as soon as the holy sabbath commenced. W hat is the canopy of peace? It is the sabbath during which all spirits, demons and elementals, together with foul infernals, go and hide themselves in the great darkness, for when the holiness of the sabbath prevails in the world no unclean spirit is able to endure it and flees from it. Wher efore on the sabbath day there is no necessity for reciting the prayer for protection, 'Blessed be thou, oh Lord, ruler of the universe, who protected thy people Israel . . .' a formula of prayer ordained to be recited during week days beca use then the world needs protection, but on the sab bath day the canopy of peace is raised and outstretched over the world and thus protected on all sides. Even the wi cked in Gehenna are also protected on that day, together wi th all beings and creatures above and below, and en joy peace and rest whilst the sabbath lasts. For this reason its holiness is acknowledged in the prayer, 'Blessed be the Lord who covers us, together with all his people Israel and Jerusalem, with the canopy of peace.' But why Jerus alem? Because there it is raised and first pinned up. We ought, t herefore, always to pray that it may ever be over u s to guard us, as a mother guards and protects her children so that the y may live in fear of nothing. Again, at the time w hen Israel pronounces this benediction and prays for this cano py of peace to rest upon them, the Holy Spirit desc ends from on high and covers them as a bird its young, with its wings. Then flee and depart all evil spirits out of the world and Israel abides safe under the protection of its Lord . Also it is then that this 'canopy of peace' or th e Holy Spirit imparts to each of its children new souls or a new life. Why? Because it is the lord and giver of life which emanates from it.\" Next: Chapter XXVI. p. 209 SAID Rabbi Simeon: \"Furthermore, we learn that the Sabbath is an image of the world to come; and so it is, for the sabbatical year is a type of the year of Jubilee. T he new life which is imparted during the sabbath is hinted in the word zacor (remember), and when it enters into the soul of ma n, joy and gladness prevail throughout the world, everything ungodly and profane becomes banished and sorrow and sighing are done away; as it is written , 'In that day the Lord shall give rest from thy sorrow and fr om thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve' (Is. xiv. 3). On the Sabbath evening, the refore, ought everyone to eat of the different arti cles of food that have been prepared, symbolizing thereby the univers al canopy of peace which includes under its cover e veryone, if there be no encroachment48a-48b on the food prepare d for the morrow. The lighting of the Sabbath candl e is devolved on the wives of the holy people, the reaso n of which is that as by a woman the heavenly light became extinguished, so by woman must it be made to reappe ar. Another and more important reason is, the canop y of peace signifies the Matronutha of the world, or the Holy Spirit whose emblem is a woman, whose expressed desire it is that a woman should be charged with lighting the Sa bbath candle, as being not only an honor, but a gre at benefit for"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"the procreating of good and holy children who shall become as lights in the world and distinguished fo r their knowledge of the secret doctrine. By it, wives will obtain long life for their husbands and will also become sources of light and instruction in their household and mar ital duties. Remark also that the Sabbath consists of a day and a night. The words 'remember' and 'keep' have one and the same meaning as it is written, 'remember the S abbath day p. 210 to hallow it' and also 'keep the Sabbath day and ha llow it'48a-49b (Deuter v. 12). The words zacor (remember), shemor (keep), referring to the male and female considere d as a whole. Blessed the lot of Israel whose hospi tality the Holy One deigns to accept and enter into the pl ace they provide for Him! As it is written, 'Happy the people who enjoy these blessings! happy the people whose God i s the Lord'\" (Ps. cxliv. 15). Said Rabbi Simeon: \"It is written, 'God understande th the way thereof and He knoweth the place thereof ' (Job xxviii. 23), What signify the words, 'God understandeth? . . .' They have the same esoteric meaning as the wor ds 'And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, mode be a woman' (Gen. ii, 22), which have reference to the oral law designated by the term 'way,' as it is written, 'Th us saith the Lord who maketh a way in the sea' (Is. xliii. 16), but the words 'He knoweth the place where it is' refer to t he written law, which is designated by the word daath (knowledge). The name Jehovah Alhim is here written in full to show that the oral or traditional is th e complement of the written law. These when combined are sometim es termed hochma (wisdom), and sometimes binah (understanding). They are also symbolized by the co mbined divine name, Jehovah Alhim (Lord God). The r ib taken from the side of man refers to the non-luminous mir ror or light of human intellect, as it is written, 'But on mine adversity (or rib) they rejoiced and gathered thems elves against me' (Ps. xxxv. 15). \"The words 'had taken from man' signify that the tr adition proceeded, from the written law; 'made he a woman and brought her unto the man,' mean that these two kind s of law must of necessity be united together, as t hey cannot exist apart, the one supplying what the other lacks . These words also refer to the attachment of man a nd his wife that should always subsist between them. Another interpr etation of the words 'God understandeth the way the reof' is, that as long as a daughter abides with her mother she is the object of maternal care, but when married it b ecomes her duty to look after the needs and wants of her husba nd, and therefore it is added 'and he knoweth the p lace where she dwells.' \"It is written, 'And He formed man.' In these words is expressed the mystery of the formation of man f rom the right and left sides of the sephirotic tree of life. Man was composed of two natures, the animal or lower se lf and the spiritual or higher self, and this because the form er is necessary to the development p. 211 of the latter. It is the lower nature of man that e xcites the female principle. It is a tradition that the north that symbolizes the evil principles seeks attachment wit h the female and therefore is she called ishah , a term compounded of two words, ash (fire, man) and H, signifying the yoni or female principle. The higher and lower self cannot become united and harmonized49a so long as s exuality and carnal desire are dominant. The term m an has already been explained, that at first it designated androgynous man, but afterwards became sundered and separated. \"We will now explain further the esoteric meaning o f the phrase, 'the dust of the earth.' When a woman marries she takes the name of her husband, therefore is he call ed ish and she ishah . He is designated zedek and she zedek , also he is described as ophar and zeb , she as ophar and zabiah ; as it is written, 'The glory (Zebi) of all lands' (Ezek. xx. 15). It is written, 'Thou shalt not plant thee a grove o f any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God ' (Deut. xvi. 21). \"Is it not permissible to plant groves in any place s not contiguous to the altar of God? In reply we s ay that the word ascher (groves) designates the husband and ascherah , the wife; as it is written, 'Bring forth out of t he temple of the Lord an the vessels that were made for Baal (husban d) and for ascherah (wife). The esoteric explanation of these words is this: the altar designates her, the Scheki na, or divine spouse, and therefore it is forbidden to raise or build any other altar and present a spouse to God beside it. Note that the worshippers of the sun are termed worshippers of Baal, but the adorers of the moon, the adorers of A scherah. \"The wife is called ascherah , derived from the word ascher , designating her husband. Why then are not they us ed any longer to distinguish a man and his wife, and a lso the celestial husband and spouse? Because the w ord ascherah comes from asher in the same sense as found in the words, 'And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed, and she called his name Asher' (Gen. xx x. 13). Now the altar of God on the earth is not ho nored and blessed by heathen nations, but despised, therefore the terms Ascher and Ascherah are not longer appli ed to the altar symbolizing the celestial husband and spouse, nor t o a man and his wife; and this is the signification of the words, 'Thou shalt not plant the ascherah near the altar,' that is. thou shalt not present to God any other s pouse p. 212 than the legitimate one, the altar of Adamah (earth ), as it is written, 'An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me' (Ex. xx, 24)."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"\"It is also written, 'And breathed into his nostril s the breath of life,' meaning that the earth was t hen made fruitful as is the female by the male, for it is animated with life-giving principles and force. Furthermore, man is endowed with a two-fold nature and thus able to develop the lowe r self, by which his earthly frame is animated. 'An d the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman.' The full divine name Jehovah Alhim is here used, an d are the father and the mother who prepared her and brought her unto the man. The word 'rib' denotes the myster y expressed in the words, 'I am dark, but comely as the tents o f Kedar and as the curtains of Solomon' (Cant. i. 5 );49a-49b for before marriage a woman resembles the non-luminous mirror, that becomes radiated after the marital uni on for which her father and mother have prepared her, and so the scripture adds, 'and brought her unto the ma n' from which we infer that the duty of the parents of a bride is to give her into the keeping and care of her husba nd according as it is written, 'I gave my daughter unto this man for w ife' (Deuter xxii. 16). From that time she goes wit h her husband into his house that is now hers, and it is his duty to consult with her on all matters appertaining to domestic affairs. Therefore it is written, 'And he lighted upon a cer tain place and tarried there all night, because the sun was set' (Gen. xxviii. 11), meaning that Jacob took the permission he enjoyed:Gen. 29:23 and therefore from these wor ds we infer that the conjugal union should be the result of con sent and permission on the part of the wife after l istening to her husband's voice of loving affection. if, however, t here be no feeling of reciprocation, no conjunction ought to take place, for conjugality should always be voluntary a nd unaccompanied with unwillingness. 'And he tarrie d there all night for the sun was set,' teaching that conjugal duties should always be nocturnal. 'And he took up the stones of that place and put them for his pillow,' meaning th at though a king possesses golden couches and fine robes, he prefers the bed prepared by his beloved spouse, tho ugh composed of stones; as it is written, 'And he l aid down in that place to sleep.' \"Note what is further written. 'And Adam said, this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh' (Gen . ii. 23). These were the words of Adam to draw Eve unto him a nd incline her to p. 213 enter into nuptial union and thus show that they ar e one and now undivided and unseparate in a higher sense than before. Then he begins to praise her that there is none like unto her, that she surpasses all other be ings, the one deserving the name of woman; as it is written, 'She shall be called woman, words that pleased her,' as it is written, 'Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou exce llest them all' (Prov. xxxi. 29). 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh' (Gen. ii. 24). That is to say that Eve was induced by these loving words of Adam to consent to enter into marital relationship with him and as so on as this was effected we read, 'Now the serpent was subtle' (Gen . iii. 7). In the moment that Adam and Eve became t hus associated,49b the lower nature became excited and aroused by sexual desire in which it delights, as s cripture saith, 'And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food she took of the fruit of it and did eat' (Gen. iii. 6), denoting that hitherto their love had been angelic and pure, but was now changed into carnal desire fi rst arising in the woman and leading them to conjugal relationship , for a woman is the inspirer of love whilst man is the receptacle of it and in this resembles angelic bein gs whose actions are determined by pure love unblen ded and unmingled with carnal desire.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"How can this be, will the lowe r nature with its passions and emotion remain attac hed to the female on high?\" Next: Chapter XXVII. p. 214 RABBI SIMEON answered and said: \"The lower or passi onate nature is always striving to imitate the acti ons of the higher, with this difference, that what is spiritua l and pure it changes into the carnal and impure. T he higher nature takes its origin from the right side of the sephiro tic tree of life, but the lower from the left side, an d is embodied in the female and becomes unified in it, as it is writ ten, 'His left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me' (Cant. ii. 6). Hitherto we have discoursed on a subject, exceedingly esoteric and unknown to ordin ary minds, but now we will speak more clearly so that every one ma y comprehend and understand them.\" On hearing this the student novitiates expressed their great desire to learn more of this mystery of sex.49b Rabbi Simeon was journeying to Tiberias and there w ere with him, Rabbi Jose, Rabbi Jehuda, and Rabbi H iya. Whilst on the way, they beheld Rabbi Pinchus coming to meet them. After exchanging greetings, they all sat down under a great shady tree by a hillside. Then said Rabbi Pinchus: \"Since now I have met with thee, oh Rabbi Simeon, and am seated by thy side, let it please thee to instruct me further in the Secret Do ctrine.\" Then spake Rabbi Simeon and said: \"It is written, ' and he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and Hai' (Gen. xiii. 3). The scriptu re saith, 'He went on his journeys' instead of 'his journey.' Whe refore? Because there is here an occult reference n ot only to his"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"own journeying, but also that of the Schekina, who always went with Jacob, and therefore we learn that whenever a man leaves his home and wife, he ought not to think or imagine that the Schekina forsakes p. 215 him in any way, for though it has been said a man o ught always to cleave to his wife that the Schekina may always be with him, yet it is possible he may go alone on a journey and the Schekina still abide with him, an d when so doing he ought to direct his prayer to the Holy One that this may be, and in this way the male and fem ale will always be associated in union with each other, whether goi ng from home or otherwise. Therefore it is written, 'The Just One shall walk before him and set him in the way of his steps' (Ps. lxxxv. 14). Whenever anyone goes on a journey, he should always be mindful and circumspect and carefu l of his words and actions, in order that his lower and higher selves may not become separated and disunited from each other, so that when he returns home their unio n may be intact and complete. This ought also to be the case when a man returns home, for then he should attend to the discharge of his conjugal duties which is lawful an d right and a source of delight both to the Schekin a and his spouse; as it is written, 'and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt vi sit thy habitation and thou shalt not sin' (Job v. 24). When, however, he neglects these duties, he transgresses against the divine ordinance. On the other hand, by attending to them, his enjoyment is enhanced by the knowledge that he is carrying out his charging, the dictates of the marital law, which is known as the covenant of the Holy One. The occult meaning of these remarks is this: that f ollowers and students of the good law should always , in the discharge of their conjugal duties, fix their minds and thoughts upon the Schekina that never quits or leaves the house on account of the spouse; as it is written, ' and Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent of Sarah, h is mother' (Gen. xxiv. 67). Now we learn from tradition that when th is occurred, a candle was lighted in a very marvell ous manner, because at the same moment the Schekina entered int o the tent along with Rebecca,--the mystical meanin g of which, is, that showers of blessings from on high descend on the right discharge of conjugal duties, for then the male and female become truly one and not till then, and the male becomes associated49b-50a both with the Scheki na or heavenly mother and his spouse; to which the words refer, 'They shall endure until the desire of the e verlasting hills be accomplished' (Gen. xlix. 26). The word ad (desi re) designates the pleasure all men experience in b ecoming united with the Schekina above in order to attain u nto perfection and the blessing resulting therefrom , and p. 216 also with his spouse who receives from him her nour ishment and affection. Again Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"The secret doct rine and its teaching have relation to two baith (h ouses), or more explicitly the human and divine, the lower and higher self, as it is written, 'for the two houses of Israel' (Is. viii. 14). Of these one is a mystery beyond human compreh ension, the other, though exceedingly occult, is wi thin the range of the understanding. The first is symbolized by the Great Voice mentioned in (Deuter v. 20). 'T he Great Voice that ceaseth not,' that is always resounding and speaking within us though unheard and unrecogni zed by the external ear. By it hath been delivered and spoken the esoteric teachings known as 'the voice of Jacob ' that they may become known. Now this great interior voice and the word which expresses it are as it were two houses, the one visible, the other invisible. One is the eternal Wi sdom (hochma ilaah) hidden and concealed in the div ine mind and sendeth forth the great interior voice; the other t he Voice of Jacob or esoteric teachings expressed b y words, especially by the term Brashith, or as it may be di fferently written and explained by the words baith reshith , meaning the house or doctrine called reshith or beginning.\" Pausing for a few minutes, Rabbi Simeon began again discoursing: \"The scriptures beginning with the wo rds, bra Alhim, the mystical meaning of which is the same as is contained in the words vyeben Jehovah Alhim ath azla (the Lord God formed the rib). The mystic signification also of the words, ath hashamayin (the heavens), is the same as vayebah al ha-Adam (and brought her unto the man). The words ve-eth ha-aretz (and the earth) also have the same occult meaning, atzm matzmi, (bone of my bone).\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"It is written, 'The Lord said u nto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool' (Ps. ex. 1). These words refer to th e Supreme, saying to Adonai next in being to Him, ' sit thou on my right hand, that the West may become joined to the East, the right to the left, so that the power and might of the idolatrous nations (or evil) may not prevail, but b ecome broken and dissipated.50a-50b 'The Lord said unto my Lord,' have also the same signification as 'Jacob s aid unto the Lord' as is seen in the words, 'the ar k of the covenant, the Lord of all the earth' (Josh. iii. 11). Another exposition of the words 'the Lord said unto my Lor d' is, p. 217 that they are significant of the holy state called 'the year of Jubilee' addressing the state called ' the Sabbatical year,' saying, 'sit thou on my right!' Observe that this l atter holy state or condition of the world, namely, Sabbatical year, has not from the beginning yet become united to the highest sephira on the right and left, who at the creation of the world took it then and joined it to its left side. For this reason, the world will not last or endure beyond seven thousand years.50b At the end of that period, howev er, this state of holiness in the world will become joined to the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"supreme sephira on the right hand and the earth the n will become perfected forever. Then will be reali zed the words, 'The new heavens and the new earth which I will mak e shall remain before me or exist always' (Is. lxvi . 22). If this exposition be correct, what then is the sense of th e words 'sit thou on my right hand?' They were spok en provisionally to Adonai 'until his enemies were mad e his footstool'; that is, until all opposition and disobedience to the divine law shall cease and peace and harmony pr evail throughout the universe, when all antinomies and antithesis of right and left, good and evil, angel and demon, shall be done away and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the seas, and h eaven and earth so long separated and disjoined sha ll become one and united forevermore, which glorious consummation is implied in the conjunction of the words, 'the h eavens and the earth.'\" Next: Chapter XXVIII. Rabbi Simeon's Analogies of t he Divine Life in Man RABBI SIMEON'S ANALOGIES OF THE DIVINE LIFE IN MAN. As Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking the students rose u p to depart, but ere they left he himself stood up and said: \"I have still a few further remarks to make before goi ng, on two passages of scripture, which seemingly a re somewhat contradictory in expression to each other. The firs t is, 'The Lord thy God is a consuming fire' (Deute r iv. 24); the other is, 'but ye that cleaved unto the Lord your G od are alive every one of you this day'\" (Deuter. i v. 4). \"If the Lord be a consuming fire as here stated, ho w could the children of Israel on becoming joined u nto the Lord escape from being consumed, and continue to lived? It has been explained how the Divine Being is a fir e that consumes every other kind of fire, for there are fl ames of fire more intense in their nature than othe rs. To this statement I wish to add a p. 218 few supplementary remarks. Whoever wishes to unders tand the mystery of union with the Divine will do w ell to reflect and meditate upon the flame proceeding from a lighted candle or a burning coal, in which may b e recognized two kinds of flame or light, one white and the othe r dark or bluish in color. The white flame ascends upwards in a straight line, the dark or blue part of the flame, being below it and forming its basis. Though these be conjoined together, the white flame is always seen clearly an d distinctly, and of the two is the most valuable a nd precious.50b- 51a From these observations we may gather somewhat of the occult meaning of the thekheloth (blue fringes) mentioned in scripture. The dark or blue flame is c onnected and conjoined with that above it, namely, the white, and also below it with the candle or coal in a state of combustion. It becomes sometimes red, whilst the s uperior white flame never varies in color and remains invariably the same. Furthermore, it is noticeable that the da rk or blue flame consumes and wastes the substance of the coal or ca ndle whence it emanates, but the white pure light c onsumes nothing and never varies. Therefore, when Moses pro claimed the Lord to be a consuming fire, he alludes to the astral fluid or flame that consumes everything simi lar to the dark flame that wastes and destroys the substance of the candle or coal. In using the term thy God, not our God, Moses refers to the white or Divine light whic h destroys nothing, in which he himself had been and came down from Mount Sinai out of it uninjured and intact. T his is the case with everyone who lives in the Divine light of the higher life. He lives, then, the true or real life, and the astral light of the lower earthly life cannot harm or inju re him. Therefore, to the children of Israel who ha d sanctified themselves and attained to this life, Moses could t ruly say: 'ye cleaved unto the Lord, your God, and are alive as at this time.' Above the white flame there is yet anot her arising out of it, yet unseen and unrecognizabl e by human sight and has reference to the greatest of mysteries, dim gleamings and notions of which are revealed to us by the different flames of a lighted candle or a burning coal.\" As Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking, Rabbi Pinchus embr aced him, exclaiming: \"The Lord be praised! the Mer ciful One, who has led me hither.\" Rabbi Simeon, along wi th his students, went and accompanied Rabbi Pinchus on his journey for three leagues, and then bidding him adi eu returned homewards. Next: Chapter XXIX. SAID Rabbi Simeon: What I have discoursed on has re ference to the secret doctrine and its teachings of the mystery of the divine wisdom united with the divine essence . Thus the final H in the tetragrammaton correspond s to the51a- 51b dark or blue flame united with the three letter s preceding it, I H V, making the white flame a lig ht. Sometimes the dark is designated by the letter D, and other t imes by H. When Israel below is not living the divi ne life, it is characterized by D; but when it becomes conjoined w ith the white light, then it takes on itself the le tter H; as it is written, 'If a damsel, a virgin, be betrothed' (Deu ter. xxii-23). The word Naarah (damsel) is here wri tten without the feminine termination H contrary to grammatical rule , naar being the male and naarah the female. Wherefore is it so written? Because she has not as yet come into union with the union with the male, and whenever this is the case the final H is found wanting. For a similar reason the dark or blue flame is designated by the letter Dale th, or D. When,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"however, it becomes conjoined with the white flame above it, it is represented by the letter He or H, for then a perfect union is effected in this sense, that the t wo become blended together (symbolizing thus the un ion of the lower and higher nature). \"Similar is the occult meaning of the smoke ascendi ng from altars whereon sacrifices are offered up. I t provokes into flame the blue light beneath it which, when it flashes forth and burns, becomes conjoined with th e white flame above it and then as in the flame of a candle becom es or forms one whole and perfect light, and as it is the nature of the blue flame to consume that from which it emanat es so does it consume the sacrifices placed p. 220 on the altar; as it is written, 'When the fire of t he Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice' (I K ings, xviii-38). From the appearance of a perfect light or flame we may gather that the blue and white portions of it h ave become united into a whole when the grease of the sacrific es and burnt offerings has been consumed and then p riests, levites, and all the rest of Israel becoming united with it join in the singing and chanting of hymns and psalm s, and the world above and the world below are again united and blen ded as the flame of a candle and become blessed in the one great Divine Light of the universe. Such is the mys tical meaning of the words: 'But ye that cleaved un to the Lord your God are alive,--every one of you--this day.' B ut wherefore doth scripture say 'but you' (veathem) and not 'you' (athem)? It is to show that whilst the sacrifices a re consumed as soon as the blue flames touch them, yet Israel (living the divine life) though attached to it is n ot consumed, but are preserved in life unto this da y. \"All colors seen in dreams are of good omen, except blue; because, as in the flame, we have observed i t consumes and destroys the body beneath it. It is the upas or deadly tree that overshadows the world, and is let hal to everything beneath it. If it be objected that there are angeli c beings on high who, along with mankind are equall y under the blue flame and yet are not consumed, our reply is that t hey, as existent beings, are celestial in their ess ence and, therefore, different from human existences who are to the blue flame what the candle is to th e light.51b-52a \"In space there are forty-five divisions or directi ons, each of which is distinguished by different co lors. The seven colors of the white light penetrate the seven abyss es. and by the effect of their vibrations upon the rocks therein, cause water to flow forth, which is an allotrophic form of the air contained in the white light; light and darkness are really the producers of air and water according as the essential part or element of matter unites with one or the other. Light in passing from its primal state descends int o this material world through sixty-five channels o r avenues through which, when it courses, a voice is heard th at makes the abysses tremble and shake, exclaiming, \"Oh, matter! let light pass through thee!\" as it is written, 'de ep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspout s (or channels)' (Ps. xlii-8). Below these there are three hundred and si xty-five smaller channels or rivulets, some of whic h in their color are white, some dark and others red. Each of these rivulets, of which there are seventeen, as it meand ers in its course, resembles p. 221 a rose in its outlines with its layers of petals. O f these rivulets rose-like in form, two are like st reams of iron and two, like copper. On the right and left of them, in the eastern and western quarters of the world, are two thrones connected and communicating with each other by mean s of these intermediate rivulets and channels. Thes e thrones form each of them a heaven, that on the right being dark colored and that on the left being variegated in hue. As the light passes from one to the other throne through t he various channels between them, it becomes more p owerful and stronger in its circulatory course, similar to the blood in the veins of the body. Such is the region on high that gives rise to the seven different colors which, in their totality and blending, constitute the great mystery of that unknown something termed light. There are also seven other different colored lights, which, on flowing togethe r and thus becoming blended, form one great ocean of light whi ch then streams forth from its seven different outl ets; as it is written, 'and he shall smite it in its seven stream s' (Is. xi-15.). Each of the seven outlets or strea ms becomes divided and forms into seven reservoirs, and each of these into the source or fount of seven rivers and which subdivide again and form seven brooklets; thus forming a vast circu latory system by which the waters of each separate and then meet again and become blended together.\" Next: Chapter XXX. The Two Serpents, Astral Fluid a nd the Animal Nature THE TWO SERPENTS, ASTRAL FLUID AND THE ANIMAL NATURE . \"A great fish coming from the left swims through al l these waterways to poison and corrupt them. Its s cales are as steel. From its mouth comes forth a lurid flame and its tongue is like a sharp sword. Its object is to force its way into the sanctuary of the great ocean to pollute and def ile it and thus extinguish light, and causing the w aters to become frozen, and the great circulatory water system may cease to operate. \"The occult meaning of this mystery is expressed in the words of scripture, 'Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made, ' (Gen. iii-6). This evil serpent wished to accompl ish his aim by"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"first corrupting the brooklets below (mankind) and making them impure and bitter, so that flowing back to the great ocean their fountain head, it might become polluted . This is why he first seduced man and brought deat h into the world and entered into the heart of man from the le ft side. p. 222 \"There is, however, another serpent that comes from the right. These two serpents are they that are cl osely attached to man during his lifetime (the astral fluid and an imal nature), as scripture saith, 'of all the beast s of the field that the Lord God had made,' these two are the most cunning, crafty and subtle in tempting and destroying man. Woe unto him who allows himself to be led on and seduced by the serpent, for death irretrievable is his doom, p hysically, morally and spiritually, both to himself and to tho se associated with him, as in the case of Adam who wished to know and become expert in nature's secrets and occu lt science. In revealing them and exciting within h im a fictitious joy and happiness, the serpent acquired that influe nce and control over Adam that contributed to and b rought his ruin and downfall and thus caused him to suffer, as also his successors. From the day that Israel came to the foot of Mount Sinai, the impurity and corruption wrought by the serpent has not disappeared from the world. \"Hear what saith scripture when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree by which death entered into their souls or lower nature, 'And when they heard the voice of the Lord of the Alhim walking in the garden' (Gen. iii -8), or, as it ought to be rendered, had walked (mithhalech). Note further that whilst Adam had not fallen, he was a recipient of divine wisdom (hochma) and heavenly light52a-52b an d derived his continuous existence from the Tree of Life to which he had free access, but as soon as he allowed himself to be seduced and deluded with the desire of occult knowledge, he lost everything, heavenly light and l ife through the disjunction of his higher and lower self, and, the loss of that harmony that should always exist betwe en them, in short, he then first knew what evil was and what it entailed, and, therefore, it is written, 'Thou art not a God that approveth wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee' (Is. v-5); or, in other words, he who implici tly and blindly follows the dictates of his lower n ature or self shall not come near the Tree of Life. \"Whilst the protoplasts had not as yet lost their i nnocence and purity, they heard within themselves t he voice divine, the voice out of the Great Silence. Guided and dire cted by divine wisdom, they walked and lived in the divine light and were not afraid. As soon, however, as they succ umbed to temptation, they lapsed into a state of si n, of sorrow and shame and found that though the voice was still audible, they could not endure to hear it; and the sense of sin pervaded and prevailed throughout the p. 223 world up to the time when Israel stood at the foot of Mount52b Sinai, purified from all defilement and thus able to become conjoined with the Tree of Life, and partook of its fruits, beholding the celestial glory. They ascended higher and higher in the divine life, and lived in the enjoyment of the Beatific Vision being filled w ith that interior peace and tranquillity known and experienced only b y those who understand the mysteries of the higher and divine life. The Holy One protected them by impressing upo n them his divine name, so that the spirit of evil was unable to exercise power and influence over them and thus cor rupt them. Thus they lived, pure and protected, unt il they bowed down and worshipped the golden calf. Then fel l they from their high estate and lost the divine p rotection which was as a cuirasse or coat of mail against the assaults of evil that now again acquired power ove r them and brought death unto their souls. \"After their fall, scripture informs us, 'and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, beh old, his face shone radiant with light, and they were afraid to c ome nigh unto him (Ex. xxxiv-30). Before this, howe ver, it is written, 'and Israel saw the mighty hand of the Lor d'; that is, they were able by the purification of the lower nature and mental and spiritual illumination, to attain un to the Beatific Vision and view the splendor and gl ory of the life on high. And so it is further written, 'and the peo ple saw the thunderings and lightnings, and the sou nd of the trumpet' (Ex. xx-13). All these glories, however, d eparted from them after their lapse into sin, so th at they could not even endure to behold and regard the luminous face of their intercessor Moses, for, as it is said, 'th ey were afraid to come nigh into him.' \"Remark, now, what is further stated, 'and the chil dren of Israel stripped themselves of their ornamen ts by the Mount Horeb' (Ex. xxxiii-6), (Horeb here meaning Sinai). By which is signified, that Israel, after sinning, became divested of their safeguards, the ornaments of purity and in tegrity, and thus fell under the power of evil. So that, as is stated, 'Moses was compelled to take the tabernacle and set it up away without the camp and called it the Tabe rnacle of the Congregation' (Ex. xxxiii-7). For what reason? Next: Chapter XXXI. A Further Symposium of Rabbi Si meon's Students "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"A FURTHER SYMPOSIUM OF RABBI SIMEON'S STUDENTS. RABBI ELEAZAR and Rabbi Abba differed widely in the ir opinions on this subject.52b Rabbi Eleazar maint ained that the tabernacle of the congregation (moed) was so called because it was a source of blessing to th e children of Israel; that as the day of the new moon is called a feast day symbolizing the decrease of impurity and the increase of purity, so it betokened that the serpent or evil pr inciple had now no power to corrupt and pollute. Ra bbi Abba, on the contrary, asserted that it was an indication of evi l. At first the sanctuary was simply called the tab ernacle, as it is written, \"Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet ha bitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down , not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed (Is. xxxiii-20 ). From which words we gather that the tabernacle w as intended to remain and abide always a source of eternal life to mankind by abolishing death on the soul (or lower nature). But after Israel had sinned, this tabernacle was termed moed, a word denoting a certain or fixed time, as it is written, \"I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the h ouse (moed) appointed for all living\" (Job xxx-23). From that time the tabernacle ceased to be the source of eter nal or divine life. Temporal life and blessings wer e all it could impart. At first it was like the full moon, but aft er Israel sinned it became like the moon in its fal l and therefore from that time was termed by Moses, tabernacle of moed, that is, a temporary erection. Rabbi Simeon was silently meditating throughout the whole night on the secret doctrine, and Rabbi Jehu da, Rabbi Isaac and Rabbi Jose were seated near him. p. 225 Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"It is written, 'And the childre n of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb' (Ex. xxxiii-6). Tradition states that Israel after sinning became subject to death and to the p ower of the evil serpent. How came it then that Joshua died, who had not sinned with Israel, being at the time with Mos es on Mount Sinai. Why, therefore was he not exempt from dying? \" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"It is written, 'The Lo rd is just and He loveth righteousness, His counten ance doth behold the upright' (Ps. xi-7). These words have al ready been explained, but there is yet another and more significant exposition of their meaning. Through hi s justice the Holy One is called just and, knowing that his law is just, mankind directs its way in accordance therewi th. Note that the holy One judges every man only ac cording to his deeds. When Adam transgressed by taking of the tree of good and evil, he caused death to appear in the world. His disobedience resulted also in separation from h is wife, and the light of the moon became diminishe d (or, his intellect became darkened). When, however, Israel s tood at the foot of Mount Sinai, this defection of the moon's light ceased it shone again in all its former power and brilliance. After sinning by the worship of th e golden calf, the moon again lost its light and the evil serpent rega ined its influence and power in the world. Perceivi ng that Israel had fallen and lost that purity and innocence that were its protection from the power of the evil one, and that sin would again prevail in the world as in the ease with Adam after his fall, Moses became eager to transfer the tabernacle from amongst the children of Israel and set it up o utside and away from the camp. Now if the sin of Ad am caused death to enter the world so that no man can escape it, this also was the case with the fall of Israel. Death appeared a second time; so that Joshua though himself pure and unspotted from sin, had along with the rest to suc cumb to it. With respect to Moses, his death was not due to the sin of Adam but was brought about through the oper ation of a mysterious power. Tradition confirms this statement which is corroborated by scripture,52b-53a 'but a young man, son of Nun, who served him, departed not out of the tabernacle' (Ex. xxxiii-11); the explicit signific ation of which is, that Joshua, though he did not escape physical death, enjoyed that union of the higher and lower n atures that enabled him to live the higher and divine life, whi ch p. 226 the children of Israel through their idolatry and w orship of the golden calf had lost and forfeited. O bserve also that when Adam fell he lost the protection of the letter s of the divine name that the Holy One had impresse d upon him, and therewith also the spiritual and divine light i n which he had lived, and recognizing this he was o verwhelmed with fear and terror, for he perceived himself nake d and despoiled of the heavenly glory and bliss he had formerly enjoyed and that he had brought by his disobedience , death, not only upon himself but also upon his po sterity throughout all ages. It is written, 'And they sewed fig leaves together and made of them coverings' (G en. iii. 7). These words have already been discoursed on; what t hey really signify is that Adam and Eve became atta ched and subject to the influence of worldly pleasures and s ought through them the happiness they had lost, as before stated. By this material or physical enjoyment the stature of Adam became diminished a hundred cubits and caus ed a division between the world above and the world belo w.53a-53b \"It is further written, 'And He drove out the man' (Gen. iii. 24). Said Rabbi Eleazer. We do not know who drove him out, nor who it was that was driven out, whether th e Holy One or not. The words are 'vaigaresh ath' (a nd he drove out ath). Who was this He? The scripture says 'ha-a dam' (the man). After sinning it was Adam who drove out here below who is here called 'ath.' Therefore Scripture first informs us the Lord God drove Adam from out of the garden"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"of Eden, as he had already driven away the 'ath' (t he Holy Spirit or Higher Self) when Eden became clo sed to him, and the path leading to it obliterated or hidden. S cripture, moreover, states, 'and he placed at the e ast of the garden of Eden, Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned eve ry way to keep the way of the tree of life.' These words allude to angels appointed to chastise the sins and transgressions of man. Numberless are the various forms under which they appear. At times they take on them the m ale or female human form. Again their aspect is sim ilar to flaming fire, and at other times it is impossible t o define or describe their manifestations. Their du ty and office is to keep the way of the tree of life and prevent man fr om acquiring and adding to that occult knowledge wh ich has brought him or resulted in so great misery and misf ortune. By a flaming sword is denoted those angels who are charged with casting fire upon the heads p. 227 of the wicked and wrongdoers. They differ in form a nd power according to the deeds of those upon whom they inflict penalties for their violation of the great law of right and justice; therefore they are termed in Scripture 'lahat' (the flaming sword), as it is also written, 'For th ere shall come a day that shall burn as an oven all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall then be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn (lihat) them up' (Mal. i v. 1). The word sword also denotes the divine sword or sword of the Lord, as it is written. 'The sword of the Lord is filled with blood'\" (Is. xxxiv. 6). Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"The flaming sword denotes all t hose angels or elementals who tempt and corrupt men through their thoughts, desires and affections so that they fall into sin and forsake the path of righteousnes s. It is notable that as soon as anyone sins he falls under the power and influence of the evil spirit or elemental that has succeeded in seducing him, and becomes filled with fear and terr or and horrid despair, and thus unable to resist an d overcome. Solomon was endowed with much wisdom and had acquir ed a vast amount of occult knowledge, and the Holy One had exalted him to be a king amongst men and to be regarded with awe and reverence by everyone. On his giving way and becoming the slave of desire, he fell under the power of th ese evil spirits who divested and disrobed him of all his intellectual gifts and endowments, so that he feared and trembled before them and thus became an illustrative example of the misery and unhappiness of those who swerve from the right path by giving way to temptin g desires and animal or carnal propensities and inclinations. Through his affections and desires, his passions a nd emotions, man incurs the greatest danger to himself; only by acquiring power of self-restraint and self-control is he able to achieve self-conquest and thus overcome and success fully resist the power and influence of the tempter , or regulate the currents within himself of the astral fluid or life principle 'coloro che sanno' which by occultis ts is termed the great serpent. At the moment of death the body beco mes by this evil serpent defiled and corruption beg ins, also they who touch it, as the Scripture saith, 'Whosoever to ucheth the dead body of a man, and purifieth not hi mself by washing of water, defileth the tabernacle of the Lo rd and that soul shall be cut off from Israel.' (Nu m. xix. I3.). Observe that every one that retires to sleep upon h is p. 228 bed at night experiences more or less a foretaste o f death whilst he sleeps, and night overshadows the world. It is then that the evil spirit is present to defile and corrupt,53b-54a and therefore on rising, the hands should first of all be washed before touching anything lest it becomes defiled likewise. The greatest care should therefor e be exercised at all times in order to avoid and escape from the serpent's impurities. By so doing he will nullify t he ill effects accruing therefrom and render himself proof against them. This liability of defilement will not howeve r endure forever, as the day will dawn when the Holy One wil l cleanse and banish it out of the world, as it is written, 'And I will cause the unclean spirit to pass out of the la nd.' (Zach. xiii. 2), and, 'he shall swallow up dea th forever.'\" (Is. xxv. 8). \"'And Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived an d bare Cain' (Gen. iv. 1) said Rabbi Abba, 'It is w ritten, \"Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of a beast that goeth downward to the earth .\"' (Eccles. iii. 21). As the teachings of the secret doctrine, so th ese words that have already been dwelt on, have man y different meanings, amounting in all to seventy, and all equa lly good and of great interest and profit to those who are able to grasp and understand them. Observe that when a man walks in the path of truth and light, a pure and ho ly spirit from on high becomes his interior guide (his Higher Self ) educates and makes him receptive of the divine li fe and its purity, from which he never afterwards is separated . When, however, anyone walks in the way of evil an d wrongdoing, he draws to himself those elemental spi rits who originate from the left side of the sephir otic tree of life and whose delight is in making him as impure as the mselves. Therefore it is written, 'Ye shall not mak e your souls unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereb y.' (Lev. xi. 43). Observe also that the son of him who is guided by the Holy Spirit in him does it likewise dwell as a friend and guide from his birth to the end of hi s life, as it is written, 'Be ye holy as I am holy' (Lev. vi. 7). He who is evil and delights in wrongdoing engenders c hildren like unto himself and the end of them will be the same a s his own. This is then the meaning of the words, ' Who knoweth the spirit of man who goeth upward and the spirit o f a beast that goeth downward.' The Divine who (mi) alone"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"knoweth the souls who incarnate, whether in pure or impure bodies, and therefore whether they will asc end or descend. Adam in himself having become impure befor e conjugal union with Eve p. 229 his offspring was therefore impure, but Abel begott en in a state of purity after repentance was conseq uently pure.54a Thus we learn why the two brothers, Cain and Abel, were so dissimilar in nature and character.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"The probable cause of their gr eat dissimilarity of nature arose from coitions of the being termed the serpent, and Adam with Eve who thus brou ght forth two sons, one of which, Cain, was from an impure, the other, Abel, from a pure progenitor; hence the difference in their lives and actions. As Cain was the issue from the death angel, he killed his brother who issued f rom the right side of the tree of life. And through him has come all the evil generations of demons and elementals now i n the world.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"The name of Cain is derived from 'qina' (a nest), showing that he was the nest or or igin whence came forth the evil beings before and after making his offering unto the Lord, as it is written, 'And in process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought of the frui ts of the ground an offering unto the Lord.'\" (Gen. iv. 3). Said Rabbi Simeon: \"What mean the words, 'in proces s of time' (miqetz yamim)? They denote the being wh o is termed 'the end of all flesh' or the angel of death to whom it was that Cain brought his offerings, an d therefore it is written miqetz yamim, instead of miqetz yemin, sign ifying the right side. Then also is it written in t he book of Daniel, 'But go thou thy way till the end, for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot in the end of the days.' (Ch. xii. 13). On Daniel hearing the words, 'till the end,' he ask ed whether they were qetz ha-yamin or qetz-yemin, a nd the heavenly voice answered: it is 'qetz yemin.' But Ca in coming therefore from the qetz yamim, to it he b rought offerings and sacrifice, product of that knowledge of the tree of good and evil which had brought so g reat ruin and misery to his parents.\" Next: Chapter XXXII. p. 230 SAID Rabbi Eleazar: \"By these words, 'And Cain brou ght54b of the fruits of the ground,' we learn that Cain and Abel offered sacrifices of a character correspondin g to their own state and nature. According to the a ctions or works of a man, so is his offering. It is pure or impure, acceptable or otherwise, as it is written, 'Say un to the righteous, it shall be well with him, for he shall eat of the fru it of his doings, but woe unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for he shall eat of the fruit of his doings.' (Is. iii. , 10 to 11.) Cain brought the fruits of his doings and met the death angel. Abel brought the firstlings of his flocks an d found they were acceptable and pleasing unto God; as it is written, 'And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offerings, but unto Cain and his offerings he had no respect,' wherefore the wrath of Cain was aroused and he was greatly incensed and so we read that when they were in the field, he fell upon his brother Abel and slew him. From other words in scripture we infer that a quarr el arose between them respecting Abel's twin sister, which i s further confirmed by the traditional rendering of the words, 'And she brought forth again with her brother Abel, ' showing that Abel was born with a twin sister. It is written, 'If thou doest well shall thou not he accepted' (Gen. i v., 7). These words have already been explained but there is another signification given of them by Rabbi Abba, thus, 'If thou doest well,' thy soul shall ascend o n high and never fall again below (sath). That is, if thou livest ac cording to the dictates of thy Higher Self, thou sh alt become united with it; but if not, thou shalt sink lower unto the dust of the earth from which thou hast come forth. \" p. 231 Said Rabbi Jose: \"This interpretation of the word ' sath' is very good and excellent, but I have heard another interpretation, which is, God said to Cain: 'If tho u doest well, the impure spirit will not abide with thee nor cleave unto thee, but if thou doest not well, sin or evil lieth at the door' (ready to overtake thee). By the word 'door' (lepathach) is meant justice or punishment from on high, for the great tribunal of divine justice is d esignated by this same word, door or gate, as it is written, 'Open un to me the gates of justice' (Ps. cxviii., 19). By ' sin lieth at the door' is meant the impure spirit which if thou fallest in to its power, will bring thy soul before the tribun al of divine justice, when it will be hurled to destruction and become di ssolved into the original element out of which it h as been formed and produced.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"At the time that Cain killed Abe l he knew not how to separate or disjoin body and s oul, but bit him like a serpent. From that moment he became accu rsed and wandered about in the world, an outcast sh unned and abhorred, until at last repenting of his sin, he be came reconciled with the Lord and found a habitatio n on a lower earth or world.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"It was not on a lower, but on our present earth that Cain after his repentance was a dmitted into human society, as it is written, 'And the Lord set a mark upon Cain'\" (Gen. iv., 15). Said Rabbi Isaac: \"From these words we gather that it was from this earth which is called Adamah that Cain was driven, and that it was on the earth called Arqa th at he afterwards became a dweller, as it is written , 'And Cain said"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"thou hast driven me this day from the face of Adama h' (earth). After his repentance, however, it was g ranted him to live on a lower earth (arqa) of whose inhabitants i t is written, 'They shall perish54b from the earth (aqua) and from under these heavens' (Jer. x., 11). It was here tha t he lived and dwelt as scripture states, 'and dwel t in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden' (Gen. iv., 16). Moreover, when Cain had killed Abel, Adam separated from his wife and cohabitated with two female elementals, and from hi s intercourse with them was begotten a great and nu merous progeny of demons and elementaries who at night tim e appear in attractive forms and thus give rise to offspring like unto themselves. In scripture, they are termed 'the plagues of the children of men.' Though human in a ppearance, they are void of hair and of them scripture speaks. 'I will chasten him with p. 232 the rod of men and with the plagues of the children of men' (Sam. vii., 14), they visit both men and w omen alike. After a hundred and thirty years he became united a gain with Eve and brought forth a son and called hi s name Seth,54b-55a signifying thereby that as the two let ters S and Th are the last of the alphabet, so this son was the ending of the terrible experience through which Eve and Adam had passed and undergone. Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"He was called Seth because he w as a reincarnation of Abel, as it is written, 'For God hath appointed me another seed in place of Abel, whom Ca in slew' (Gen, iv., 25). Furthermore, we read that Adam begat a son in his own likeness, after his image, and cal led his name Seth (Gen, v., 3), denoting that the f irst children of Adam had no resemblance to him either physically or morally. This was the opinion of Rabbi Yeba the ag ed as given by Rabbi Simeon. The first children brought f orth by Eve were begotten by Somoal who appeared to her riding on the back of a serpent, and were therefore not endowed with the human body. If the question b e asked: seeing that Abel came from a different side of the tree of life to that of Cain, wherefore had not Cai n a human body? The reason was, because neither of them were begott en in a state of absolute purity.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"But scripture states that though Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived and brou ght forth Cain, yet it does not say that Adam begat Cain. Spe aking of the birth of Abel it further states, 'She brought forth again his brother Abel.' Therefore, of each of them it is not said that they were begotten after the l ikeness and image of Adam, as it is expressly said of Seth.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"Adam as stated was separated fr om his wife a hundred and thirty years, during whic h time he begat demons and elementals that swarmed throughout the world. Whilst under the influence of the impur e spirit he felt no desire to become associated with Eve, but a fter repenting and overcoming his animal propensiti es, he became again united to her and then it is said, 'he begat a son in his own likeness.' Observe that when a man begins walking in the wrong and downward path his thoughts and inc linations become impure and carnal, all love of vir tue and purity leaves him through the impure elementals he attracts into his aura. Happy and blessed are they who find and walk in the path of light that shineth more and mor e unto the perfect day, for then are their lives tr uly clean p. 233 and real lives and their offspring is like unto the m; and of them scripture saith, 'For the upright sh all dwell in the land.'\" (Prov. ii., 21). Said Rabbi Hiya: \"What signify the words 'And the s ister of Tubal Cain was Naamah' (gentleness), and w herefore was this name given her? Was it to indicate that sh e possessed the power of seducing both human and an gelic beings?\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"She overcame Aza and Azael who i n scripture are called 'sons of God.'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"She was the procreatrix of all the demons of Cainite origin, and she it is that al ong with Lilith afflicts infant children with epileptic diseases.\" Said Rabbi Abba to Rabbi Simeon: \"Master, you have stated she was so called because she inspired men w ith carnal desires.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"That is true, for though she ex cites lust in human beings, yet this does not preve nt her from afflicting young children and thus she continues he r operations in the world up to the present time.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"Seeing that demons and elementals are subject to death, wherefore do Naamah and Lili th continue to exist through the ages?\" Rabbi Simeon replied: \"All demons and elementaries do indeed die, but Naamah and Lilith together with Agereth, daughter of Mahlath their offspring, abide in the w orld until the day that the Holy One will banish an d drive all evil and impure spirits out of the world; as it is writt en, 'And I will cause the unclean spirit to pass ou t of the land' (Zach. xiii., 2). Woe unto those who are ignorant and ther efore unable to avert and ward off the influence of these defiling elemental beings that swarm in their myriads throug hout the world. If it were permitted to behold them , we should be amazed and confounded and wonder how the world c ould continue to exist. Observe that Naamah being t he exciter of human concupiscence and carnality, it is obligatory on everyone to practice and perform act s and rites of purification, so that he may become and preserve hi mself pure and undefiled.\" "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Next: Chapter XXXIII. Traditions Concerning Adam TRADITIONS CONCERNING ADAM. \"THIS is the Book of the generations of Adam.55a-55 b In the day that Alhim created man, in the likenes s of Alhim made he him.\" (Gen. v., 1.) Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The Holy One showed Adam the forms and features of his descendants that should appear in the world after h im, and of the sages and kings who should rule over Israel. He also made known to him, that the life and reign of David would be of short duration. Then said Adam to the Holy One, 'let seventy years of my earthly existence be taken and granted to the life of David.' This reque st was granted, otherwise Adam's life would have attained to a thou sand years. This was the reason that David said: 'F or thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in the work of thine hands (Ps. xcii., 5), for thou hast filled me with joy in prolonging the days of my life. 'It was thy own act and wish,' said the Holy One, 'when th ou wast incarnated as Adam, the work of my hands and not of flesh and blood.' Amongst the wise men and sages t hat should appear on the earth, Adam rejoiced greatly on behol ding the form of Rabbi Akiba who would become disti nguished by his great knowledge of the secret doctrine. On s eeing, however, as in a vision, his martyrdom and c ruel death, Adam became exceedingly sad and said: 'Thine eyes b eheld me ere I was clothed in a body and all things are written in thy book; each day hath its events that shall co me to pass, are therein to be found.' Observe that the book of the generations of Adam was that which p. 235 the Holy One through the angel Rosiel, guardian of the great mysteries and secret doctrine, gave unto Adam whilst yet in the garden of Eden. In it was written all th e secret wisdom and knowledge concerning the divine name of seventy-two letters and its esoteric six hundred an d seventy mysteries. It also contained the fifteen hundred keys, the knowledge and understanding and use of which had ne ver been imparted to anyone, not even to angels, be fore it came into the possession of Adam. As he read and st udied its pages, angelic beings assembled around hi m and acquired the knowledge of Hochma, or divine wisdom, and in their delight exclaimed 'Be thou exalted, o h God above the heavens, and let thy glory be above all t he earth' (Ps. lvii., 5). Then was it that the holy angel Hadraniel sent one of his subordinates to Adam, saying unto h im, 'Adam! Adam! guard thou well and wisely the gre at and glorious gift entrusted to thee by thy Lord. To non e of the angels on high have its secrets55b ever be en revealed and imparted, save to thyself. Be thou therefore discre et and refrain from making them known to others.' A cting on these injunctions Adam zealously and secretly kept this b ook up to his expulsion from the garden of Eden, st udying it and making himself acquainted with its wondrous mysteri es. When, however, he disobeyed the commands of his Lord, the volume suddenly disappeared leaving him overwhe lmed with grief and most poignant regret, so that h e went and immersed himself up to the neck in the river Gihon. On his body becoming covered with unsightly ulcers and sores threatening physical dissolution, the Holy One inst ructed Raphael to return the book to Adam. After ob taining a full knowledge of its occult teachings, he handed it, wh en at the point of death, to his son Seth, who in h is turn bequeathed it to his posterity, and eventually it c ame into the possession of Abraham who was able by its secret teachings to attain to higher and more enlightened knowledge of the Divine, as was the case with his p redecessor Henoch and enabled him, as it is written, 'to walk with the Alhim,' that is, to converse with them.\" Next: Chapter XXXIV. Male and Female Created He The m. \"MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"In these words are involved and contained great occult truths, even the greatest a nd most profound divine mysteries respecting the origin and creation of man, and so beyond human comprehension that they must remain subjects p. 236 of faith and not of knowledge. Of the creation of t he world it is written, 'These are the generations of the heavens and the earth be hibaram (when they were created); but at the creation of55 b-56a man, scripture states, 'God blessed them and called their name Adam, be yom hibaram' (i n the day when they were created), From the terms m ale and female, we gather that every figure that does not b ear the form of the male or female, is not in the i mage and likeness of Adam Kadmon, the primal ideal man of wh ich we have formerly spoken. Observe that in any pl ace of scripture where the male and female are not found u nited together, the Holy One is said not to dwell o r be present with His blessing and the name Adam is only used wh en such is the case.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Since the destruction of the te mple, Israel no longer enjoys the blessings that de scend from on high daily on the earth. Yea, one may say that they have become lost unto Israel, as it is written, 'T he righteous perisheth and no man layeth to heart' (Is. lvii., 1 ). The word perisheth here denotes the blessings fr om on high, but which are now of no beneficial effect in the renova tion of human nature, for as stated, 'Truth is peri shed' (Jer. vii.,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"28); the truth that brings with it light, frees the soul from its downward propensities and informs us whence all blessings descend and come to man, namely, from the Holy One of whom it is written, 'And He blessed th em.' It was through Seth that have come forth all the generatio ns of the righteous in the world.\" Next: Chapter XXXV. The Antediluvians and Their Mag ical Arts THE ANTEDILUVIANS AND THEIR MAGICAL ARTS. Said Rabbi Jose: \"Adam through disobedience to the divine commandment, lost the knowledge and understa nding of the secret doctrine and occult power and meaning of the letters of the alphabet except the two last, n amely, the letters Shin (S) and Tau (Th), because though he ha d sinned yet was not goodness wholly extinguished w ithin him and therefore to express his feeling of gratitude f or this concession, he called his son Seth. After h is repentance and reconciliation with his Lord, the letters with the knowledge of their mystical meaning and power becam e known again to him, but in their reverse order thus, Th, S, R, Q, in which they continued up to the day the children of Israel stood at the foot of Mount Sinai, when they became arranged again in their normal order as on the day that the heavens and the earth were created. This redistribu tion of the alphabetical letters p. 237 contributed to the permanent welfare and endurance of the world.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"When Adam transgressed, the heave ns and the earth trembled and wished to become diss olved into their original elements and disappear altogeth er because the covenant between God and man on whic h they were founded had become broken, of which it is writ ten, 'If the covenant of day and night had not exis ted, I would not have made those laws that govern and control th e universe.' (Jer. xxxiii., 25.) We know that this covenant was broken by the transgression of Adam as scripture st ates, 'but they like Adam have transgressed the cov enant' (Hos. vi., 7). If the Holy One had not foreseen that Isra el on arriving at Mount Sinai would accept the cove nant, the very heavens and the earth would have ceased their exist ence and reverted back into chaos.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"The Holy One remitteth and fo rgives everyone who confesses his sins and wrongdoi ngs. Observe that when the world was created, the Holy O ne made the covenant upon which it continues to exi st. We infer this from the word Brashith which should be w ritten thus, bara, shith: meaning 'He created the f oundation' or the covenant, symbolized56a by the letter Yod (I) i n the middle of the word shith which though the sma llest of the alphabetical letters, nevertheless represents the c ovenant through which all blessings come to mankind . When a son was born unto him, Adam confessed his sin and was f orgiven by the Holy One, and therefore he called hi s name Seth, having the same consonantal letters as Shith without the Yod, symbol of the covenant he had tran sgressed. Furthermore, the Holy covenant is also symbolized b y the letter Beth (B) which became incorporated wit h S and Th when the children of Israel stood at the foot of Mo unt Sinai and thus formed the Sabbath (S B Th), of which it is written, 'Wherefore the children of Israel shall ke ep the sabbath (or covenant) throughout their gener ations for a perpetual covenant.' It is a sign between me and th e children of Israel forever.'\" (Ex. xxxi., 16). Said Rabbi Jose: \"The two letters Shin and Tau were then associated and from the time the children of Israel received the covenant at Mount Sinai, they acquired the occult knowledge and understanding of the myst ical meaning of all the letters of the alphabet that, wi th the exception of Shin and Tau, had become lost t o mankind.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"From the birth of Seth to the c oming p. 238 of Israel to Mount Sinai, the mysteries of the lett ers were gradually unfolded and revealed to the pat riarchs, but not fully, as the letters were not in their normal orde r as at present.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"In the days of Enos, men were deeply versed in occult knowledge and magical scien ce and the manipulation of natural forces, in which no one was more skilled than he, since the time of Adam whose chief study was on the occult properties of the leaves of the T ree of Knowledge of good and evil.56a-56b It was En os that taught and imparted this occult lore to his contemp oraries, who in their turn handed it down to the an tediluvians, the persistent and perverse opponents of Noah. They boa sted that by their magical science they were able t o ward off the divine judgments threatening them. Whilst Enos lived, men became initiated into the higher life, a s scripture states. 'Then began men to make invocations in the name of Jehovah.'\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"All the just men who lived subse quent to Enos, as Jared, Methusalah and Henoch, did all in their power to restrain the practice of magical arts, but their efforts proved futile and ineffectual; so th at the professors of them, proud of their occult knowledge, became rebel lious and disobedient to their Lord, saying, 'Who i s Shaddai, the almighty, that we should serve him and what profit should we have in praying unto lam'?' Thus spake th ey and foolishly imagined that by their occultism and magi c they would he able to nullify and turn away the o ncoming judgment that was to sweep them wholly out of exist ence. Beholding their wicked deeds and practices, t he Holy One caused the earth to revert back to its former condi tion and become immersed in water. After the deluge , however, He"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"gave the earth again to mankind, promising, in His mercy, it should never again and in like manner be destroyed. It is written, 'The Lord caused the earth to be covere d with the deluge' (Ps. xxix., 10). The word for Lo rd, here, is Jehovah and not Alhim; the first representing mercy , the other severity and judgment. In the time of E nos, even young children became students and trained in the h igher mysteries and knowledge of the secret doctrin e.\" Next: Chapter XXXVI. SAID Rabbi Jose. \"If all this is true, why were the y so exceedingly foolish and blind that notwithstan ding all their occult science they could not foresee the flood whi ch the Holy One was preparing for their destruction ?\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"They knew full well what was abo ut to take place, but in the perversity of their he arts they said: 'We know the angels presiding over the fire and ove r the water and, by our magical science, will be ab le to restrain and prevent them from injuring us.' But alas! they were ignorant that the Holy One ruled in the world, that from him cometh judgment and retribution, angels being the e xecutors of his decrees. This they knew not until t he day that the deluge appeared, even though the Holy Spirit had pr eached unto them that 'sinners shall be consumed fr om off the earth and the wicked shall be no more' (Ps. civ., 3 5). The Holy One was forbearing and long-suffering towards them during the lives of the just men, Jared, Methusalah and Henoch. After their decease, then judgment qui ckly overtook these antediluvians and they were cut off in their sins and wrong-doing, as it is written, 'They were destroyed from the earth.'\" (Gen. vii., 23.) Next: Chapter XXXVII. Of the Patriarch Henoch and t he Sin of the Antediluvians \"OF THE PATRIARCH HENOCH AND THE SIN OF THE ANTEDILUVIANS.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Whilst the king sitteth at his ta ble (bimsibo) my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof\" (Cant. i., 12). This verse has already been explained, but there is yet another interpretation worth noting. Whenever a man walks with and cleaves unto the Alhim as did Henoch , the Holy One, foreseeing his liability to decline in goodness and uprightness, p. 240 arranges to take him out of the world whilst the pe rfume of his good deeds endures. This was the case with Henoch. The words, 'Whilst the king,' refer to the Holy One ; 'at his table,' allude to the man who walks and c leaves unto him; whilst the words 'my spikenard sendeth forth the sm ell thereof, denote the good deeds for which he is taken out of the world and thus escapes and avoids falling into sin. And this is why King Solomon said: 'There are just and upright men who suffer affliction as if they had co mmitted evil deeds and are taken away.' There are a lso unjust men who live to a good age granted unto them by the Hol y One,56b-57a that they may repent and turn unto hi m. Henoch was just and walked with the Alhim and he was not, and Alhim took him, for God foresaw that he would u ltimately become a transgressor of the law and that this migh t not be; he was taken from the world before his ap pointed time. By the words, 'he was not,' is meant that he died w hilst he was comparatively young.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"The Holy One took Henoch away from the evil of the world, into the celestial regi ons on high, and imparted unto him the secret knowledge of the h ighest mysteries and of the forty-nine keys necessa ry for understanding the various combinations of the sacre d letters, and which the angels themselves make use of. It is written, 'And God saw that the wickedness of men up on the earth was great and all the imaginations and thoughts of their hearts were only evil continually.' (Gen. vi. , 5.) Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"'Thou art not a God that hath p leasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell wit h thee' (Ps. v., 5). Observe that he who gives way to the temper and suffers himself to be led and guided by it, defile s not only himself but also those with whom he comes into pers onal contact. As already stated, though the wickedn ess of the antediluvians was great and their evil deeds were m any, yet was the Holy One unwilling to destroy them , but long- suffering towards them, notwithstanding, and their shameful propensities and heinous practices, of whi ch it is written 'that they were only evil continually.' The ir evil actions are denoted by the word (Ra) (pollu tion). Of Er, the eldest son of Judah, who was guilty of this sin; it is written that 'he was wicked in the sight of the Lord and the Lord slew him.'\" (Gen. xxxviii ., 7.) Said Rabbi Jose: \"Is not this sin synonymous with w hat is termed rashang (wickedness or wrongdoing)?\" p. 241 \"No,\" replied Rabbi Jehuda, \"for rashang is applied to intentional57a evil ere it becomes an actuality , but Ra refers to him who defiles himself by the dissipation of hi s vital powers and thus gives himself up to the unc lean spirit called Ra. He who thus renders himself impure will never attain unto the Divine Life nor behold the fa ce of the Shekina, whose disappearance from the world previou s to the deluge was owing to the vice termed Ra. Wo e unto"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"him who indulges in it, for he will never experienc e the joy of living in the presence of the Holy One , but will drag on through life as a degraded captive and miserable slave of Ra, the unclean spirit; so true are the w ords, 'The fear of the Lord leadeth to life, it bringeth peaceful nigh ts free from visits of the impure spirit Ra' (Prov. xix., 23). And therefore it is written, 'Evil (Ra) shall not dwell with thee' (Ps. v., 4). Only the pure in life and thought and deed can say, 'Yea though I walk through the valley of the s hadow of death, I will not be afraid of Ra, for tho u art with me and causest me to dwell in the house of the Lord fo rever.'\" (Ps. xxiii., 4-6.) Next: Chapter XXXVIII. The Divine Compassion THE DIVINE COMPASSION. Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'And it repented t he Lord that he had made man on the earth and it gr ieved him at his heart' (Gen. vi., 6). 'Woe unto them that draw iniq uity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart-rope' (Is. v., 18). The words, 'that draw iniquity,' refer to thos e who sin against their \"Lord every day and imagine their wrong- doing is of less consequence and worth than a cart- rope. With this class of wrong-doers the Holy One i s exceedingly patient and long-suffering, and punishes them not u ntil their misdeeds get beyond endurance. When the Holy One executeth judgment upon sinners in the world, yet i s he unwilling they should perish; since notwithsta nding their transgression, they are his children, the work of h is hands. Though their punishment is inevitable, ye t like as a father pitieth his children, so doth he pity them; so grea t is his love and compassion towards them that even when punishment and suffering overtake the erring and si nful, he is full of compassion and grieved in heart , if we may so express it, like the Persian monarch who sought to deliver Daniel, of whom it is written, 'Then the ki ng went to his palace and passed the night fasting; neither were i nstruments of music brought before him, and his sle ep went from him.'\" (Dan. vi., 18.) p. 242 Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The words, 'And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,' have the s ame meaning as the words, 'And the Lord repented of the evil wh ich he thought to do unto his people.'\" (Ex. xxxii. , 14.)57a-57b Said Rabbi Yusa: \"The interpretation of the rabbi i s favorable to man, but in the opinion of Rabbi Hez ekiah it is otherwise.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"When the Holy One created man to dwell upon the earth, he formed him after the liken ess of Adam Kadmon, the heavenly man, when the angels gaze d upon him, they exclaimed: 'Thou hast made him alm ost equal to Alhim and crowned him with glory and honor .' After the transgression and fall of Adam, it is said the Holy One was grieved at heart because it gave occasion f or repeating what they had said at his creation, 'W hat is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him, or the son of man that thou shouldst visit him.'\" (Ps vii. 5.) Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"It grieved the Holy One that he must punish man severely and thus appear as acting in contradiction to the greatest of his attributes, (m ercy), as it is written. 'And he appointed singers unto the Lord to march in front of the army, praising the beauty of holiness and saying, 'Praise the Lord, for his merc y endureth forever.'\" (II. Chron. xx., 21.) Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Why was this song of praise comp osed like those psalms that begin with the words, P raise the Lord for he is good, was it not because the term 'g ood' (tob) might not be used when Israel was compel led to destroy people whom the Holy One made and created? When Isr ael passed through the waters of the Red Sea, the a ngels on high assembled round the throne of the Holy One and sang praises. Then spake he and said: wherefore si ng yeEx. 15:1 a song of praise, seeing so many, the work of my hands, are drowned in the depths of the sea? So is it when a sinner perishes; the Holy One is grieved at heart, when he is cut off from the face of the earth.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"It is of a truth so; for when Ada m fell through transgressing the divine commandment , the Holy One said: 'Oh Adam! thou art become dead unto the h igher divine life.' At these words, the light of th e Sabbath candle became extinguished and Adam was driven out of the garden of Eden. Moreover, the Holy One furth er said: 'I made thee ascend and placed thee in Eden to offe r sacrifices; but seeing thou hast profaned the alt ar, it is my decree that henceforth thou shalt be a tiller of th e ground and die at last--for from it was thou take n, p. 243 and unto it shall thou return.' Ere, however, this occurred the Holy One had compassion on him and per mitted him to live and be buried in the vicinity of Paradise; for Adam had discovered57b a cave from which emitted a light which he recognized as coming from out of the garden of E den; and there he, along with his wife, lived and d ied. Observe that no one goeth out of the world without seeing i mmediately after death his ancestor Adam, who seeks to know the cause of his decease and what his moral and spiritu al state to which he has attained. Then says the de ceased one; Woe unto thee, for thou art the cause wherefore I h ave ceased to live; to which Adam replies: I transg ressed but one only of the commandments and suffered therefrom, bu t what must be thy punishment who hast broken so ma ny by thy misdeeds.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Hiya: \"Adam was seen on different occasi ons by the patriarchs, to whom he confessed and acknowledged his sin and showed them the place wher e he had enjoyed the divine light and glory from on high and also where his descendants, the righteous, and thos e who obeyed the Good Law, through their good deeds now live the diviner life in the garden of the celestial Ede n. Then praised they the Lord and said, 'How excell ent is thy loving kindness, oh God, wherefore do the children of men put their trust in the shadow of thy wing.'\" (Ps. x xxvi., 7.) Next: Chapter XXXIX. p. 244 SAID Rabbi Yissa: \"Everyone on leaving the world go es57b-58a into the presence of Adam so that they ma y learn that not his, but their own sins and wrong-doing ha ve caused their death. Amongst myriads of those tha t have lived and died, only three have there been whose decease was not owing to sin, but was brought about by the malicious designs of the serpent, namely, Amram, Levi and Ben jamin, and also Jesse, who committed no sin worthy of death. Observe that all the antediluvians sinned openly an d unblushingly. Rabbi Simeon was once walking in th e environs of Tiberias and on beholding men committing polluti on, he exclaimed, 'How dare these wretches sin agai nst their Lord so openly and shamefully.' Then went from him a hypnotic or magnetic force that impelled them to cast themselves into the sea and be drowned. Observe als o that every species of sin and wrong-doing done op enly, causes the Shekina to take its departure from the d elinquent and guilty one and cease its abiding with him. This was the case with the dwellers before the deluge and th ereby they cut themselves adrift front the Holy One , hence it is written, 'Take away the dross from the silver, then shall it be formed into a vessel; take away the wi cked from before the King and his throne shall be established in rig hteousness.'\" (Prov. xxv., 4-5.) Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"It is written, 'And the Lord s aid my spirit shall not always abide (or dwell) wit h man, for that he is flesh' (Gen. vi., 3). When the Holy One creat ed the world, he made it after the pattern of the w orld on high and as long as its inhabitants lived pure and upright l ives and caused the divine spirit or life into that part of the world, in which Jacob dwelt afterwards into the land of Israe l during the reign of David, p. 245 whence heavenly blessings and influences gradually extended over the whole earth; and therefore it is written, Praise the Lord for he is good, for his mercy extendeth th roughout the world. The word ubed olam (world) has reference to that part of the spheres on high named David, and t herefore is written without the letter Van (u), sig nifying that where the divine influence descends from that celes tial region, then blessings are poured down on the world below. But as mankind sinned, the life divine has been tak en from the world and only those who strive to atta in unto, now enjoy its blessings whilst the unjust are unable to appropriate it for their wicked and magical purpos es. The meaning of the words for that he also is flesh (beshagam) i s, that, this58a divine life might not become abuse d by the serpent and others for their evil purposes, and so kept uns ullied and undefiled by contact with the wicked and impure.\" \"By the word 'flesh,'\" said Rabbi Simeon, \"is meant the angel of death, whilst the words, 'the days of man shall be a hundred and twenty years,' mean to the thread or si lver cord as it is termed, shall be broken that bin ds body and soul together. It is written, 'There were Nephalim (gian ts, fallen ones) in the earth in those days.'\" (Gen . vi., 4.) Said Rabbi Jose: \"The nephalim here mentioned were the angels Aza and Azael, whom the Holy One hurled from heaven onto the earth. If the question he asked, ho w could they exist on earth in a state so different to that they enjoyed in heaven?\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"They were of that class of angels of whom scripture says 'and fowl that fly above th e earth' (Gen i., 20), and who manifest themselves to mankind, in human form. When descending upon earth they are ab le to assume various shapes that become materialized and thus visible to mortal eyes. These rebel angels Aza and Azael hurled upon the earth became embodied in material b odies of which they could not after rid themselves. Charmed and overcome with the beauty of the daughters of me n, they continue living unto this day, teaching men and initiating them into magical art and science. They begat children who were termed anakim (giants), Gib orim (mighty ones). Such were the fallen angels who formerly wer e called sons of God.\" Next: Chapter XL. Traditions Concerning Noah TRADITIONS CONCERNING NOAH. Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'And the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the fa ce of the earth! (Gen. vi., 7); also, 'My thoughts are not your thou ghts and my ways are not your ways saith the Lord' (Is. lv., 8). When anyone seeks to wreak his vengeance upon anoth er, he keeps silent and lets not a word escape his lips lest his enemy learning his intention takes steps to guard a nd protect himself. The Holy One acts not so, when sending forth his judgments upon the world, but warns it again an d again of their coming. He has no fear of being ba ffled by those whom he is about to chastise, and no one can hide f rom him nor escapes his decrees. He made known thro ugh Noah"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the judgments58a-58b he was about to execute upon t he antediluvians, but they took no heed and therefo re sudden destruction came upon them and they perished from o ff the face of the earth. Of Noah it is said, 'And he called his name Noah (rest, comfort) saying, this same shall c omfort us concerning our work and the toil of our h ands, because of the ground which the Lord had cursed' (Gen. v., 29). How was it that his father could give utteranc e to these words? The explanation is that when the ground had been cursed, Adam said to the Holy One: Ruler and L ord of the universe, how long shall the earth remain cursed?' Said the Holy One: 'Until one be born like unto thy self bearing the sign of the covenant.' In hope and expectation mankind lived on till the birth of Noah, in the ant icipation of benefits and blessing they would enjoy during his l ifetime. Before the appearance of this patriarch, t hey were unversed in the science of agriculture and the use of the plough and harrow. Everything was done by ha nd labor. When Noah attained to manhood, he invented implemen ts for tilling the ground and making it fertile; an d so, in the words of Lamech, his father, he became a comforter, a helper unto men, in his work and the toil of the ir hands, whereby the curse was taken from off the ground, fo r as at first when sown it brought forth thistle, n ow it produced corn in abundance, therefore he became known as and called the husbandman.\"Gen 9:20 Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"He was called thus for the same reason that the husband of Naomi was called Elimel ech (Ruth i., 3). Of Noah it is written also that he was zadd ich, just, because by the sacrifices offered up by him, he freed the earth from its curse, concerning which we read that 'the Lord smelled a sweet p. 247 savour' (Gen. viii., 21); or in other words, was pl eased with them and said, 'I will not again curse t he ground any more for man's sake.' Such are the reasons why Noah was so called. Continuing his remarks, Rabbi Jehuda said: \"It is w ritten, 'Come and see the works of the Lord who doe th wonders on the58b earth.\" (Is. xl., 8.) The words see (hazo n) here has the same signification as in the words, 'The Lord has revealed unto me, hazouth qashah, a remarkable prop hecy or vision' (Is. xxi., 2), from which we learn this fact, that prophecy is revelation from the Holy One on high to mankind, and also that the word shamuth is usually translated, wonders or marvelous things such as desolation, and yet here it should be read shemoth (names), teachi ng us that it is God who inspires the naming of everyone's name t hat corresponds to and is expressive of his or her life and character. Another interpretation is that the word shamoth in the above verse from the Psalms, signifi es really 'destructions' for if the world has been created by the divine attribute termed Jehovah it would have been indestructible, but as it is, the work of Alhim (ju stice) is liable to dissolution and abolishment. It is written, 'Come and see the works of Alhim, that are subject to des tructions (shamoth) on the earth.'\"Ps. 46:9 Said Rabbi Hiya: \"I cannot agree to this interpreta tion, seeing that Jehovah and Alhim are alike sacre d and names of the Divine Being, and therefore I think in common w ith several students that shemoth signifies holy na mes, as by the combination of the divine names, marvellous and wondrous things are done on earth.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"These different interpretations with that of Rabbi Jehuda are all excellent, for if the world was created by the name of 'rakhma,' that is by Jehovah , it is indestructible, if by severity or Alhim, th en is everything in it liable to perish; if there were no punishment fo r evil and wrongdoing, the world and society could not continue to exist. At his birth Noah was named by a term expres sive of solace, or comfort, with the idea that he w as to be a source of help and consolation to his progenitors a nd descendants, to the world above and the world be low, to this world and the world to come. This was not however t he case with respect to his relations with the Divi ne Being, for on reversing the letters of his name, Noah became K hen, meaning grace, and so it is written, 'But Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord.' (Gen. VI. 8.) The name o f Judah's eldest son Er, when reversed becomes Ra ( evil) and is an anagram p. 248 expressive of his natural character, therefore scri pture describes58b-59a him as 'wicked before the Lo rd.'Gen. 38:7 When Noah came into the world and grew up to manhoo d, beholding the perverse lives of men sinning agai nst the holy One, he retreated from amongst them and devote d himself to the worship of his Lord, and thus esca ped from the general pollution. If it be asked what was the subject of his studies whilst in retreat? It was th e Book of Adam that had been handed down till at last it came into the possession of Henoch; and from it Noah learned how essential and necessary it was to offer sacrifices unto his L ord. From this book he also learned that the world had been created by Hochma, (the sephiroth wisdom) and that it was o wing to sacrifices it still existed; for without th em or were they not made, neither angels above nor man below would be able to exist. Next: Chapter XLI. RABBI SIMEON was walking one day in the country acc ompanied by Rabbi Eleazar, his son and his students , Rabbi Jose and Hiya. As they wended on their way, E leazar said to his father: \"That this our walk may be profitable, instruct us further, we pray thee, in the secret do ctrine.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Then spake Rabbi Simeon and said: \"It is written, W hen he that is a fool goeth on his way, his heart f aileth him and he saith to everyone that he is a fool' (Eccles. X. 39).Eccl. 10:3 When a man desires that his ways ma y be agreeable to the Holy One and before going on a journey he ou ght first of all to seek counsel from his Lord (hig her self) and repeat the traveler's prayer, as saith the scriptur e, 'The upright shall walk before him and follow hi m on his way' (Ps. LXXXV. 13). That is, the Divine Shekina will never forsake us on our pilgrimage through life. But he w ho lives without faith in his Lord is as the fool whose hear t or courage when on his way faileth him. The occul t meaning of the word heart (leb) is the Holy One, who never acc ompanies a fool on his way nor grants him the aid a nd assistance he needs, because by his infidelity and indifferenc e to the teachings of the good law, his heart faile th him, or in other words, the Divine Presence goeth not with him and h e becomes known to others as a fool, for whenever h e hears others speaking and discussing together on divine t hings, he derides and despises them. It is related of such an one, after pondering over the mark of the covenant, that every son of Israel bears on him, he affirmed it w as a mere rite and no sure sign either of true religion or of fait h in the Divine Being. When the venerable Rabbi Yeb ba heard these words he directed his looks and gaze upon the heret ic, who gradually shrivelled up into a lifeless mas s p. 249 p. 250 of skin and bone. As however it is our desire to be blessed59a with divine help and guidance whilst on our way, we will endeavor to give expression to a few teachings out of the secret doctrine. It is written, 'Teach me thy way oh Lord, I will walk in thy truth, unite my heart to f ear thy name' (Ps. LXXXVI, 11). The interior signif ication of these words is difficult to understand, yet they inculcat e that all things are in the hand or power of God e xcept the purity or impurity of our lives and deeds. What David mean t by them was, open my eyes that I may understand t hy secret mysteries, then shall I be assured I am walking in the true path of light, swerving therefrom neither to the right or left; 'Unite my heart to thee,' then shalt thou bec ome my strength and portion forever and it shall be filled with the fear of thee and thy Holy name. Observe that everyo ne who reveres the Holy One, in the proportion of h is reverence, makes himself recipient of the higher life and dail y approximating to it becomes eventually united wit h the Divine. On the other hand, he who is lacking in reverence a nd faith in the divine, makes himself unworthy and unfitted for entering into the joys of the world to come. We rea d that the path of the upright is as a shining ligh t that shineth more and more unto the perfect day (Prov. IV. 18). Blessed are the upright both in this world and the world to come for the Holy One, blessed be he! takes delight and joys in their progress and ascension towards the hi gher life. The light here spoken of, is the light that the Holy On e created at the beginning of the world and reserve d for those who by their obedience to the good law, become united t o their higher self and so are qualified to enter i nto its enjoyments in the world to come. But of the worldly minded and selfish it is written, 'The way of the wicked and unjust, is as darkness--they know not at what they stumble' (Prov. IV. 19). If the question arise, kno w they not why they stumble and fall? scripture informs us, it is because their paths are tortuous and serpentine, th eir irrational lives are spent in the indulgence of sensual desires and unredeemed with few if any generous deeds of self-s acrifice or consideration for the welfare and happiness of othe rs, and thus they live on never realizing that for all these things they shall be brought into judgment and stand self- convicted and self-condemned at the bar of their ow n conscience, filled with unavailing regrets and crying, 'Woe unt o us that we never gave heed nor opened our hearts whilst in the world for the entrance and reception of truth, woe unto us!' Note, that for p. 251 their good deeds, the Holy One will grant unto the upright and unselfish, abundance of light and enjoy ment in the region on high which eye hath not seen, nor hath it entered into the heart to conceive of (Is. LXIV. 3 ), the celestial sphere of the Beatific Vision. Happy the lot of the just and pure in both worlds, for of them scriptur e affirms, the righteous, the unselfish shall inherit the earth fo rever; (Is. LX. 21), they shall praise thy name, an d the upright shall dwell in thy presence (Ps. CXL. 12). Blessed be the Divine Being forevermore, Amen and Amen.\"69a-59b It is written, \"These are the generations of Noah\" (Gen. vi. 9). The students of Rabbi Simeon were ass embled together and meditating upon the secret doctrine. T hen spoke Rabbi Hiya and said: \"Thy people also sha ll be all righteous, they shall inherit the laud forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified\" (Is. Ix. 21). Blessed is Israel who deli ghts in the study of the secret doctrine, the knowl edge of the mysteries of which qualifies than to live the highe r life of the world to come. Observe that every Isr aelite or initiate in the mysteries never fails to attain unto it, ina smuch as he obeys the good law of the universe, and therefore it is written of him, \"Had I not made my covenant with da y and night, I should not have prescribed the laws that govern the heavens and the earth\" (Jer. xxxiii. 25). True Israelites are moreover called zaddikim (righteous) on account of the purity of their lives, symbolized and distingui shed by the mark or sign of the covenant (circumcis ion). Whence do we infer this fact? From the example of Joseph w ho was termed a Zaddik or just one, because of his purity of life and observance of the covenant. Said Rabbi Eleazer: \"Wherever in scripture the word 'Aleh' (these) occurs there is an antithesis of so me kind between what precedes and what follows it. For inst ance, in (Gen. ii. 10) it is said, 'and a river wen t out of Eden to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads.' This said river that went out of Eden and entered into paradise, brought into it waters o f celestial origin which gave life to the plants an d flowers which grew therein and which only ceased on the completio n of creation when, as it is written, 'God rested f rom all his work that he created and made.' Herein consists the mystery of the word aleh, occurring in the verse, 'These are the generations of Noah,' marking an antithesis between the generation of Noah and those preceding him, na mely, the generations of Adam, or in other words, comes betwe en the manifestation p. 252 and development of life on the celestial and earthl y planes of existence. Noah symbolized humanity beg inning its earth career and for this reason is said to be 'ais h ha-adamah,' the earthly man (Gen. ix., 20). The b iblical account of Noah and the deluge contains a deep mystery that ex plains why it was necessary that Noah should enter the ark. It was in order to keep seed (human race) alive upon t he face of all the earth (Gen, vii., 3). If so, of what then was the ark a symbol? The ark of the covenant (the good law ) by which celestial or Adamic humanity was kept an d preserved and without which it could not have enter ed upon its mundane career of existence and progres sion; that is, without the continuance of the good law in the worl d, the higher self could not have operated in the p rogressive development of the lower self, which therefore woul d have perished and reverted back to its pre-evolut ionary or elemental state. Ere present humanity began evoluti ng on the earth, the Holy One entered into a covena nt with the Higher Self, as it is written, 'But with thee I wil l establish my covenant and thou shalt come into th e ark' (Gen. vii., 8). Scripture states that Noah was a just man (Gen. vi., 9) because a type of the ideal man Adam Kadmo n, who is described as 'the righteous or just,' and also the foundation of the world (Prov. x., 25). Both alike have the same appellation of 'just,' the one in the celestial wor ld, the other in the terrestrial world. This occult mystery is contained in the words 'Noah walked with Alhim' (Gen. vi., 8) ; that is to say, that Noah and Alhim were never di sjoined or separated, one being the reflection of the other on the earth plane, and therefore it is written, 'Noa h found grace in the eyes of the Lord' (Gen. vi., 8). Noah, moreover , is said to have been 'a just man and perfect in h is generations' (bedorothav). The word 'perfect' (thamin) here deno tes that he was born circumcised, and was also the source of perfection not only to his generation but also to h is future posterity. This being so, it appears that Noah from the time of creation was predestined to enter and be in corporated within the ark, and also that previous t o this event, humanity was not in a perfect state or condition, a nd only after his abode in the ark is it written, ' and of them was the earth overspread' (Gen. ix., 19). The word 'overspr ead' (naphzali) here has the same meaning 'ipared' (divided itself), as in Gen. ii., 10 'and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted, th at is, became divided into four heads.' In the work of creation i t was at the moment of this p. 253 dividing that the fertilizing and fructifying princ iple from on high entered into the world and made t he earth fruitful as it does on the celestial plane, and therefore sc ripture states that 'aleh,' this principle of life, descended into Noah in order that through him the human race might appear and be perpetuated on the earth plane.\" After Rabbi Eleazar had ceased speaking, Rabbi Abba went and embraced him, saying: \"Oh lion! that brea keth rocks and dasheth them to pieces. Truly hast thou e xposited the occult signification of the ark.\"59b-6 0a Rabbi Eleazar, continuing his discourse, said furth ermore: \"It is written, 'And he called his name Noa h, saying this shalt comfort us concerning the work and toil of ou r hands' (Gen. v., 29). Here the word 'ath' is foun d before 'shemo' (his name). That is not so in the words 'And he cal led him Jacob.' What is the reason of this commissi on? Noah and Jacob symbolize two different divine principles of operation. Thus in vision Isaiah says, 'I saw the ( ath) Lord' (Is. vi., 1), the prophet using 'ath' to intimate that h e beheld both the Schekina and the Lord together. S o is it also found with the name of Noah, teaching us that he was name d by the Holy One and Schekina together, whilst Jac ob, another patriarch symbolizing a lower state of exis tence, received his name from the Holy One only.\" \"These are the generations of Noah,\" said Rabbi Jeh uda, 'A good man is gracious and lendeth (to the po or); he will guide his affairs with prudence' (Ps. cxii., 5). Th e term 'good man' designates the Holy One, and ther efore is it written, 'The Lord is good to all (Ps. cxlv., 9). ' The Lord is a man of war,'Ex. 15:3 for he alone giv eth light and nourishment to this lower world and guideth it with judgment, as it is said, 'Righteousness and equity are the foundation of thy throne' (Ps. lxxxix., 14). Furthe rmore, the Just One or the ideal man is also design ated as 'a good man,' and so it is written, 'Say unto the Just One that he is good, for he shall gather the fruit of h is labors' (Is. iii., 10).\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"This verse refers to Noah, as it is expressly said of him 'Noah was a just man.'\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"I think the words are an eulogy of the Sabbath, in the honor of which the Psalmist begins his praise of it by the word 'good.' It is good to prai se the Lord (Ps. xciii., 2).\"Ps. 92:1 Next: Chapter XLII. p. 254"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"SAID Rabbi Hiya, after listening to these comments of his fellow students: \"These different exposition s really amount to one and the same meaning. The generations of Noah signify the present human race in the worl d, the offspring and work of the Holy One.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"When the Holy One arrays himsel f, it is in the ornaments from both the celestial a nd terrestrial worlds,60a-60b from the former with that heavenly l ight on high that no human being can approach unto; from the latter with the souls of the righteous who the more they approximate themselves to this divine light t he more receptive and filled with it do they become, so tha t through them it expands in all directions and the world like a cistern or ocean is filled with it. It is written, 'Drink water out of thy cistern (meborecha) and run ning waters out of thy well' (beareche) (Prov. v., 15). Why does scrip ture use these two terms cistern and well, beginnin g with bar (cistern) and ending with bear (well or fount). Bec ause the one contains; the other produces or sends forth water, and scripture wishes to teach us that the cistern will eventually become a well. Like a poverty stricken a nd poor man, the souls of the righteous or just are possessed of not hing in themselves, and are as a cistern into which water is poured. Every worldly minded and unjust man bears on him th e mark of the letter D (daleth meaning poor) and is like a cistern without water. But the souls of the just be come founts or wells sending forth water in all dir ections. Who operates and produces this change? It is he, the so urce and origin of celestial light, who causes it t o now into human souls on the earth plane as we have stated before. Another signification of these words is, that they apply to David, whom scripture makes to say, 'Who (mi) will give me p. 255 60b to drink water of the cistern in Bethlehem?'2 Sam. 23:15 The term 'running water' also designates Abra ham, 'out of' (bethokh) Jacob and 'thy well' Isaac who is called a 'fount of springing or living water' (Gen. xxvi., 9). In this same verse is contained the holy and profound mystery of the patriarchs, amongst whom King David is include d. The desire of union between the opposite sexes is only excited when the female becomes receptive and fille d with the female spirit or principle which, becoming conjoine d with the male principle from on high, causes fert ility. So is it with the synod or congregation of Israel (or the pu re and initiated in the secret doctrine). It experi ences a desire after the Holy One only when it becomes filled with the s pirit of righteousness and then is made fruitful in goodness and then union with the Divine is a source of the great est joy and delight, that has been thus expressed b y a writer. 'The Holy One then comes forth and takes delight in the company of the souls of just men made perfect.' Obs erve that the children of the garden of Eden, or the Edenic race of beings, became human only after Noah, the Just O ne, had entered the ark, or in other words had become incor porated. Until that happened, they were invisible a nd unmanifested as humanity which would never have bee n able to exist as at present on the earth plane un less Noah had entered the ark (of incarnation) and given birt h and origin to offspring, subjected to the laws of evolution and development that generate alike both in the celesti al and terrestrial worlds by which it was rendered competent to multiply and replenish the earth. Such is the occul t meaning of the oracular words 'Drink waters out o f thy cistern and running waters or streams out of thy well.'\" \"And the earth also was corrupt before God\" (Alhim) (Gen. vi., 11). Said Rabbi Jehuda, \"Scripture stat es that the earth was also corrupt and then adds, 'before the A lhim.' Why so? It was in order to show the men of t hat generation then existent on the earth lived in violation both of natural and moral law,--that their wickedness wa s flagrant and open before man and God.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"I think otherwise. The words sign ify, that men committed crimes secretly and known o nly to Alhim and that only by their enormity and heinousne ss did they manifest to everyone. The words 'these are the generations of Noah' apply equally to mankind who b efore the advent of Noah lived in open wickedness a nd to his posterity whose sin was in secret.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"From the time of Adam's transgres sion of the divine commands all his descendents wer e called p. 256 sons or children of Adam, not as a term of honor, b ut as a characteristic of birth from an ancestor wh o by his disobedience had broken the divine law. When Noah a ppeared in the world, men were termed the sons of N oah, an honorable distinction, as being the offspring of hi m who preserved the human race from extinction and not of Adam whose sin caused it to disappear by bringing death into the world to every soul.\" Said Rabbi Jose in objection to this statement: \"If this were really true, wherefore is it written 'An d the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the childr en of Adam builded' (Gen. xi., 5), the sons or chil dren of Adam and not of Noah and who were living after the time of the deluge.'\"60b-61a Said Rabbi Abba in reply: \"Through his disobedience it would have been better for Adam had he not been created, as all who like him become transgressors of the law are denominated 'sons of Adam,' not because derivi ng their birth from him but as being transgressors as he was, and such were the builders of the tower of Babel. Now m ay we gather why scripture uses the word Aleh (these are the generations) to distinguish the difference exis ting between the Adamic and Noachic races of mankind. The genera tions of Noah were now no longer termed the sons of Adam,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"but the sons of Noah who introduced into and brough t them forth out of the ark in order to re-people t he world. Adam did not bring forth children or sons out of th e garden of Eden, for had he done so they would hav e been immortal or extra human. Then also would not the li ght of the moon have become diminished and the work of creation would have endured everlastingly. Even the highest angels themselves would not have equalled man in the endowment of celestial light, beauty of form and wi sdom as it is written, 'In the image of Alhim creat ed He him' (Gen. 1. 27). But the children of Adam, begotten af ter his expulsion from the garden of Eden, were bot h mortal and unworthy.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"How was it possible for Adam to beget offspring in the garden of Eden, as it is certain, the tempter would have had no power over him and he wou ld have remained childless in the world, even as Is rael if they had not sinned by worshipping the golden calf, would have remained unique as a race and would not have given birth to another generation?\" Said Rabbi Abba in reply: \"My contention is this. If Adam had not sinned he would not have engendered and begotten offspring un der the influence of the tempter (sexual desire), b ut of the Holy Spirit (the Higher Self). After the fall, his offspring p. 257 begotten under the influence of animal sexual prope nsities, were mortal, not being pure and unalloyed in their origin and constitution but compounded of the animal and s piritual. If however he had not fallen and remained in the garden of Eden, he would have begot offspring entir ely spiritual and who in their constitution would h ave been as pure and immortal as the angels and other celestial beings. The children born after his expulsion from Eden enjoyed only a temporary and ephemeral existence up to the appearance of Noah who, after entering the61a ark ( of incarnation) and by his righteous living becoming u nited with his Higher Self, was then able to produc e offspring that eventually spread themselves throughout all pa rts of the earth, leaving behind a posterity that w ill survive to the end of the world. Said Rabbi Hiya: \"It is written, 'And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way' (Jona h III. 10). Observe, when men become upright and obey the dicta tes of the good law, the earth itself changes and a cquires a virtue to administer to the enjoyment and happiness of mankind, as then the Schekina or that divine so mething termed life that operates in all organic and inorga nic creatures and by its attractive power binds tog ether the mundane and heavenly sphere, the harmony between wh ich, results in peace and joy. On the contrary, whe n sin and wrongdoing prevail, this divine life and influence is banished from the earth, which becomes itself in fected and desolate and infertile through the evil influence t hat then pervades it. But if Israel sins, which God forbid, scripture states that then Alhim quits the earth and ascends into heaven (Ps. LXII 6) and also gives the reason thereof, 'because they have prepared a net for my feet. My s oul is bowed down through their iniquity; which wor ds are expressive of a degree of wickedness similar to tha t of the antediluvians. If it be asked, do they app ly equally to Jerusalem? Doth the Schekina forsake it when men be come corrupted? for we have been taught that it is under the special care and protection of the Holy One who has chosen it for his habitation, so that no other spi rit or celestial chief reigns and rules in the land of Israel. Notwi thstanding this, we affirm that it comes to pass th at an evil spirit or influence visits it and corrupts the dwellers there in. How know we this? From King David of whom it is written, 'And David beheld the angel of the Lord standing be tween' the earth and the heaven having a drawn swor d in his hand stretched over Jerusalem' (I. Chron. XXI. 16), owing to the land of Israel having become corrupte d by evil.\" Next: Chapter XLIII. p. 258 SAID Rabbi Eleazar: \"What David beheld at that awfu l moment was not an angel but a manifestation of th e Holy One. The scripture uses the words 'The Angel of the Lord' as a metaphoric appellation of the Divine Be ing, 61aas did also Jacob when blessing Ephraim and Manasseh s aying, 'The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.'Gen. 48:16 And furthermore, in Exodus XIV. 19 . The Almighty is referred to and designated as 'Th e Angel of the Lord that went before the camps of Israel remov ed and went behind them.' Whether Israel acts uprig htly or not, the Holy One is still its ruler and governor in ord er that it may not become subject to other nations, and that its good works may put them to shame. It may however be said , yet it is written, 'The adversary hath spread out his hand upon her pleasant things, for she hath seen the hea then entered into her sanctuary' (Lam. I. 10). If t he Holy One governs Israel as stated, how was it that the heath en entered her sanctuary and destroyed it? Scriptur e itself gives the reason, as it is written, 'Thou hast done all these things (Jer. XIX. 22).Lam. 1:21 The Lord hath done that which he hath devised. He hath fulfilled what he proposed in days of yore (Lam. II. 19).Lam 2:17 From these wor ds we conclude and affirm that notwithstanding the occurr ence of all these calamities, the Holy One is still ruler of Israel and that only by his permission could they have hap pened. Observe, scripture states, 'And Alhim looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt,' because the Sch ekina had deserted it, as we have said. Moreover it is stated, 'And God saw their works that they turned from their evi l way' (Ion. III. 14).Jonah 3:10 The cry of the ear th is always"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"ascending heavenwards and desirous of union with th e celestial world, enrobes itself with raiments of beauty and splendor, as doth a maiden expecting the arrival of her lover. p. 259 [paragraph continues] When its children are upright and virtuous, they b ecome its ornaments.

When, however, they became brazen, openly lewd, obscene and sensual, then like an immodest courtesan casting aside her veil, it also became unclean and corrupted, as it is written 'The earth is defiled by the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlas ting covenant' (Is. XXIV. 5). Then corruption both moral and physical prevailed throughout the world, for all fl esh had corrupted it's way upon the earth.\"61a-61b Rabbi Eleazer was once on a visit to Rabbi Jose the son of Rabbi Simeon and grandson of Lakunya, who o n beholding him spread a sumptuous couch on the floor in order to recline and rest himself. After engagi ng a while in silent meditation, his grandfather said: \"Have you ever heard your father explain the meaning of the w ords, 'The Lord hath done that which he had devised. He hath f ulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old?'\"Lam 2:17 Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"Initiated students have interp reted them thus, the words 'fulfilled his word' (bi tza emratho) signify that God hath rent his purple robe of glory and light with which he had arrayed himself from t he beginning of creation, and contributed to the beauty and perf ection of his sanctuary.\" Then asked his grandfather again: \"Does a king thin k or devise punishment before his son has acted wic kedly?\" To this Rabbi Eleazar replied; \"A certain king poss essed a most costly and precious vase. Fearing the loss of it, he caused it to be continually placed before him. At l ength his son came to visit him and on a dispute ar ising between them, the king in a moment of anger seized hold of the vase and dashed it to pieces on the ground. Suc h is the signification of the words; 'The Lord hath done wha t he had devised.' Observe, from the day the sanctu ary was finished and completed, the Lord regarded it with c ontinuous joy and delight, yet fearing that Israel would act wickedly, he determined it should be destroyed. Whi lst Israel kept the good law and lived in obedience to its dictates, purely and uprightly, there was the sanct uary the glory of God on the earth, but when Israel fell with idolatry and forsook his worship it was destroyed. At its destruction then only did the Holy One p. 260 feel grief at the punishment of the guilty. On all other occasions it is a source of delight to him wh en the wicked through their misdeeds are swept out of the world, as it is written, 'When the wicked perish there is shouting.' (Prov. XI. 10). If, however, it be objected, we are taught that the Holy One never rejoices at the punishment of the evildoer observe that punishment is twofold in its character . There is the punishment of those who, despite the admonitions and long-suffering of God, continue in their wicked ness. The suffering of these causes joy to the Holy One. There is also the punishment of those whose perversity in cr ime has not attained its climax. Far from being a s ource of joy to him, their suffering causes the Holy One to sorrow and grieve over them. There are wretches who are af flicted before their wickedness has reached its culmination , as it is written, 'For the iniquity of the Amorit es is not yet full' (Gen. XV. 16). If, again, it be asked, wherefore Go d chastises sometimes those whose iniquity is not f ull? We answer, evildoers whose bad deeds injure only thems elves are punished only when the measure of their i niquity is filled, whilst the unrighteous who attach themselve s to Israel with the object of afflicting and injur ing it are punished before their evil intentions are realized. It is th e chastisement of this class of evildoers that caus es grief to the Holy One. Amongst such were the Egyptians that were drow ned in the Red Sea, and the enemies of Israel in th e time of Jehoshaphat It is written: 'For yet seven days, and I will cau se it to rain upon the earth, forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth'\" (Gen. VII. 4). Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Wherefore this limit of forty d ays and nights? It was because this number is alway s found in connection with the infliction of punishment, as it is written, 'Forty stripes he may give him and not exceed' (Deuter. XXV. 3). This number is fixed to correspond with th e four cardinal quarters of the world, each of whic h is divided into ten parts or degrees as man was created to cor respond with them in a manner, for the commission o f crime he must not he beaten with more than forty stripes. Fo r a like reason, this number forty was equally nece ssary in the punishment of the world.\" Rabbi Isaac was sitting in presence of Rabbi Simeon , and in course of conversation asked the question: \"What is the real meaning of the words, 'And the earth was corru pt before the Alhim.' Though man commit crime how c an it affect the earth and make it corrupt?\" p. 261 Rabbi Simeon replied: \"Scripture informs us that th e earth and all flesh upon it had together become c orrupt. There is found another and similar expression or statemen t, 'And the land is defiled and therefore I do visi t the iniquity thereof upon it.'

Again Rabbi Isaac questioned Rabbi Simeon: \"Wherefo re did God punish the antediluvians by a deluge of water rather than by fire or some other scourge?\" Rabbi Simeon replied: \"Therein is involved a deep m ystery. In indulging in the heinous sin of self pol lution man impeded and prevented the union of the waters above with the waters below, or in other words, the male and female principles, and as therefore punished by a watery e lement; so that in their case the punishment fit th e crime. Scripture states, 'All the foundations of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven were opened.' (Gen. VII. 4). The fountains of the great deep refe r to the waters below, and the windows of heaven to the waters above.\" Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jehuda when traveling, passed near some great and lofty mountains, in the gorges and fissures of which they observed bleached skeletons of the remains of men who had perished in the delug e. They measured two hundred feet as they extended on the r ocks. Overcome with astonishment, they said: \"Now w e comprehend what the masters have told us, why the a ntediluvians feared not the divine punishment, as it is written . 'Therefore they say unto God, depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways (Job XXI. 14) .' But their haughtiness and pride of strength availed them noth ing, for they perished, swept off the face of the e arth by the waters of the deluge.\" p. 262 \"'And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet'\" ,62a-62b (Gen. VI. 10), said Rabbi Hiya to Rabbi Je huda, \"Come and I will make known unto thee what I have l earned as to the occult meaning and sense of these words. The life of Noah was similar to a man entering into a c avern, from which after a certain time, come forth two or three sons, each of them different in character, habit an d temperament, one being upright, one unjust, whils t the third is void of any special trait of disposition. The same peculiarity and distinction between individuals obt ain alike in the three worlds. Observe when the soul descends from t he celestial sphere or plane in heaven it becomes a s it were entangled in mountain ravines, and meeting with its lower intellectual self, they take on the animal b odily life, and thus blended form one individual.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda, \"The mind and the lower nature d epend the one on the other, but the spirit (the hig her or real self) is independent of both of them. They are loca ted or inhere in the physical organization, but not it, which as yet has never been discovered or seen by any individual . When a man leads a pure life, his higher self is present and aids him in his endeavors, and by its purifying and enlightening influence enables him to attain to an d enter into the enjoyment of the higher life of peace and bliss uns peakable. If, however he is careless and unwilling to live the higher life, then though he may become intellectual . he can never become pure and one with the Divine. Furthermore, whose lives impurely depraves his natu re, and by ignoring the dictates and admonitions of the spirit within him renders himself more and more receptive of and swayed by objects of sense in following the bent of his animal appetites and inclinations.\" It is written, \"And God said unto Noah, 'the end of all flesh is come before me'\" (Gen. VI. 12). Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"David says, 'make me to know mine end and the meas ure of my days, what it is, that I may know how fra il I am.' From these words addressed unto the Holy One, we le arn that there are two ends, one on the right hand, the other on the left, which man must choose to walk in during h is life on earth. Of that on the right it is writte n, 'Go thou thy way until the end be, for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of thy days' (Dan. XII. 13). Of that on the left it is said, 'He setteth an end to darkness and sear cheth out all perfection, the stones of darkness an d the shadow of death. He considereth the depth of all p. 263 things.' (Job XXVIII. 3.). When by affliction and s uffering the stones buried in darkness become manif ested and the shadow of death hovers over, then the end of darkne ss becomes visible, or in other words, the angel of death or the serpent. Thus 'the end of all flesh' has the same m eaning as the words 'the end of darkness,' that is, the death angel or the serpent. 'He considereth the depth of all thing s' refers to the same being who, when62b-63a judgme nt falls upon the world, constitutes himself the satan or accurse r of mankind and strives to disparage and blacken t he characters of all creatures. With reference to the end on the rig ht, the Holy One said to Daniel, 'Go thy way till t he end come, for thou shalt rest.' Thereupon Daniel turned and said, 'In which world shall my rest be, in this or the w orld to come?' 'In this world,' replied the Holy One, \"where rest is n ecessary, 'as it is written, 'He who walks in the r ight way shall rest in his bed' (Is. LVII. 2). Then asked Daniel again of the Holy One, 'Shall I be of the number of those who will rise"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"again at the end of the world?' The Holy One replie d 'Thou, shalt rise.' Said Daniel then 'I know that amongst these who shall rise, there will be upright and just men who during their lives on earth walked in the path of truth, and others there will be who have done wickedly, but as yet I know not amongst which I shall rise again.' Said the Holy One, 'In thy lot or state in which thou diest.' Aga in Daniel spake and said, \"Thou sayest unto me, 'Go thou thy way to the end (lekh lecetz). There is an end on the ri ght and an end on the left, which of these meanest thou?'\" 'The end on the right,' answered the Holy One. David also sa id unto the Lord, 'Make me to know my end,' and fou nd no rest until he knew which it would be, and it was said un to him, 'Sit thou on my right hand.'Ps. 110:1 Obser ve, the Holy One also spake unto Noah, 'The end of all flesh has come before me.' What does the word 'end' here mea n? It is that which causes the faces of all creatures to become p ale and darkened. Hence we learn that the worldly m inded and impious attract to themselves this end or state tha t causes the hue and complexion of their visages to become dark and gloomy. This unknown something or terror called 'the end' does not seize hold of anyone except by permission from on high. When God spake to Noah, it was presen t before him, waiting for his word of authority to seize hold of the antediluvians, and then he added, 'I will destr oy them with the earth,' at the same time saying un to Noah 'Make thee an ark of gopher wood,' in order to protect hi mself and ward off the attack p. 264 of the death angel that he may have no power over h im. Observe, we have heard that when death invades a city or enters into the world abroad, a man should not walk in the public streets and thoroughfares if he wish es to avoid the death angel, who then has the power to afflict and destroy anyone whom he meets and encounters. Theref ore, was it the Holy One said unto Noah, 'Thou must conceal thy self within the ark and so avoid meeting the destro ying angel and thus be secure from his lethal power.' If it be said, there was no such being existing at the time of the deluge whose waters caused the destruction of the human ra ce, observe that no judgment has ever overwhelmed t he world but what this malefic angel has been present to inf lict it. At the time of the Flood, he was present i n the water which was an instrument used by him, and so God warned No ah and counselled him to avoid his presence by buil ding and entering into the ark. But if it be furthermore ask ed, what advantage could accrue to the patriarch by so doing? How could that prevent the entrance into it of the dest royer? Our reply is, that he has no power over anyo ne so long as he keeps himself out of his sight. We gather this from what happened to the Egyptians, since God commande d, 'Let none of you go out of the door of his house until t he morning.' (Ex. XII. 22). What was the reason of this prohibition? That he might avoid meeting the destro ying angel who had the power of inflicting death. T herefore was Noah admonished to include and hide himself in the ark and thus escape destruction.\" Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jose, whilst traveling in Arme nia, and passing by some great and lofty mountains, observed in them vast gorges and deep ravines resulting from the action of the waters of the deluge. Said Rabbi Hiya. \"These have existed from the time of the flood and, by the will of the Holy One,63a will endure unto the end of the world as tokens or reminders of the great wickedness of the antediluvians , even as it is his will that by their good deeds, the memory of the righteous should abide before him and never be effaced. And even with those who delight not in his service, their evil works are transmitted and becom e manifested throughout all generations, as it is w ritten, 'Though thou wash thyself with nitre and take thee much soa p, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith th e Lord God '\" (Jer. II. 22). Said Rabbi Jose \"We read, 'Lift up thy voice, Oh da ughter of Gallim, cause it to be heard unto Laish, Oh! poor Anathoth' p. 265 [paragraph continues] (Is. X. 30). These words already explained apply r eally to the congregation of Israel. The daughter of Gallim besides designating the daughter of Abraham our father, refers also to Israel who i n another part of scripture is termed 'a closed fountain:' The ter m 'Gallim' also signifies rivers, which all flow to wards the garden they fill and irrigate, as it is written, 'Thy plan ts are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fru its' (Cant. IV. 13), cause it to be heard at Laish has the same meaning as 'the lion (laich) perisheth from lack of prey' ( Job. IV. 12). Laish denotes the male and laishah the female. Wher efore so, is it because scripture states, 'The lion is strongest amongst beasts and fearless of any it meets' (Prov. XXX. 30) or 'The lion is dead through lack of prey .' The true interpretation is in the word laish, an occult term of that mundane virtue which emanating from on hig h manifests itself on the earth plane. When the affluents of th e celestial virtue cease descending and are no long er transformed into the lower mundane power, 'laish' then takes th e name of 'laishah'; that is, it manifests itself a s female. The words ' aniah anathoth (oh, poor anathoth) signify the same as those (in Jer. I. 1), namely 'Jeremiah, son of Hilhiah, of th e priests who lived in poverty (ba-anathoth), and als o those I Kings II. 26'. And unto Abiathiar, the pr iest, said the king, 'get thee to Anathoth, or, rather, live thou in poverty in thine own fields; the signification o f which words is as63a-63b follows: During the life of David Abiatha r lived in wealth and opulence, but after David's de cease Solomon condemned him to live in poverty on his own laud or property.\" "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Next: Chapter XLIV. p. 266 SAID Rabbi Hiya \"Since the day that Adam transgress ed the command of God, the world became affiliated with poverty until the advent of Noah, who, through the sacrifice he offered up, caused it to regain its no rmal fertility. \" Said Rabbi Jose, \"the earth recovered its fertility , but did not become freed from the infection of th e serpent until Israel stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and was uni ted with the Tree of Life. And if they had not brok en the law; there would have been no death in the world, Israel having become purified. When they sinned through t heir idolatry of the calf, the first tables of the law that freed it from the power and influence of the serpent or 'the end of all flesh' were broken. When the Levites rose up to slaughter and kill, the Israelites engaged in idolatrous wors hip the serpent who is the same as the destroying angel, placed him self at their head, but was unable to inflict any i njury on them, as they were protected by certain amulets that made th en impervious to his attacks. And only when God sai d unto Moses, 'Put off thy ornaments from thee' was the se rpent able to smite them as it is written, 'And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mo unt Horeb' (Ex. XXXIII. 5). Why is the word here us ed vaithnatzelon (they were despoiled) and not vainatzelon (stripped off).63b It is in order to show that the Israelites deprived and despoiled of the protecting ornaments (amulets or pentacles) they had affixed on themselv es at Mount Sinai when receiving the law, fell under the influe nce of the serpent who had now the power to afflict them.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"Why, if Noah was just and upright , did not death disappear out of the world? It was because it was not p. 267 altogether purified and freed from the infection of the serpent.63b Moreover, the antediluvians had lost all faith and belief in the existence of the Holy One and were re ally atheists and given up to the worship and servi ce of the evil one, who after the deluge caused men to sin in a si milar manner to those who lived before it, for the holy law that constitutes the Tree of Life was not revealed on ea rth by the Holy One until Israel stood at the foot of Mount Sinai. Noah was, therefore, unable to suppress death in th e world, but rather, after his exit from the ark co ntributed to its continuance and perpetuity therein, as it is writte n, 'and he drank of the wine and was drunken; and h e lay naked in his tent'\" (Gan. IX. 21). Next: Chapter XLV. Kabbalistic Explanation of the F east of Tabernacles and The Loulab Kabbalistic Explanation of the Feast of Tabernacles and The Loulab. As Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jose travelled onwards, the y beheld a stranger approaching them whom they judg ed by his appearance, to be an Israelite. After saluting him they asked \"Who art thou.?\" \"I am,\" he replied, \"a resident of the village of Ramin and as the feast of Tabernacles is coming on I have been specially deputed to prepare the Loulab and am therefore on may way to cut down palm branch es and prepare them according to ancient and legal custom. After walking a little together, the stranger turni ng to them said, \"Do you know why the Loulab must c onsist of four different objects in order to secure the blessing o f rain upon the earth?\" \"With Students of the Secre t Doctrine,\" they answered, \"it has often been a subject of much disc ussion, but if you know anything that will further enlighten us, we pray you to impart it unto us.\" Then spoke again the stranger and said, \"The villag e in which I live, though small and in an obscure l ocality, is distinguished by the residence of students of the S ecret Doctrine and also of a master, Rabbi Isaac, s on of Jose of Melrozaba, who daily gives discourses and lessons o n occult subjects from which we always gather knowl edge new and most interesting. Once when conversing with him , he stated that during the Feast of Tabernacles th e Israelites are exalted and pre-eminent above all other people and nations of the world and therefore we carry p. 268 the Loulab in hand as a trophy of victory over them , inasmuch as only from Israel, do the great chiefs of idolatrous nations receive and participate in the blessings th at descend from heaven. These chiefs or governing a ngels are called in scripture \"hamayim hazzedonim\" (the proud waters) as it is written 'Then had the proud water s gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.' (Ps. CXXI V. 5.) The fo ur components of the Loulab (the palm, willow, myrtle and citron) 63b-64a correspond to the four letters of the sacre d name I H V H by which Israel is exalted above all other nations and to whom is owing the descent of water to serve as libations upon the altar of sacrifice. From the beginning of the Feast of Tabernacles to Cippur or day of expiat ion, the holy One sits and judges the world, during which period, the Serpent no longer appears before Him as man's accuser, being attracted to the goat that is offered to him and therefore heedless of anything of a sacred char acter. So is it with him when a goat is offered to him at the time of new moon. For this reason, the children of Israe l pray then the Holy One to grant them remission and forgiveness of their sins.\" "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Next: Chapter XLVI. The Occultism of Sacrifices THE OCCULTISM OF SACRIFICES There is yet another subject the knowledge of which is only imparted to those who are conversant with the teachings and wisdom of the Secret Doctrine. From all others I am prohibited and forbidden to discourse thereon. \"What may that be?\" asked Rabbi Jose. \"I cannot,\" said the st ranger, divulge it unless I am assured of your fitn ess to receive it.\" Travelling on together in silence, he turned to the m and said: \"When the moon approaches the sun, the Holy One by his power revives the North and attracts it to hims elf to himself in love; whilst the South revives it self. When the influences of these two combine and blend together; then occurs the conjunction of the two luminaries. When the sun rises in the east it attracts the influences of these two cardinal quarters and reflects them upon the moon at full. The approximation and conjunction of the sun and mo on are analogous to that of the male and female. Th e law of attraction prevails throughout the universe, in the world above as in the world below and is expressed in the aphorism--\"as above so below.\" As the right side of the sephirotic tree stands for love, the attractiv e principle, so does the left stand p. 269 for rigour or the principle of repulsion personifie d by the serpent from whom emanate all impurity and corruption and death. It draws and attracts all who are recept ive of its evil influence. Now when the North is not revived by the Holy One, the moon becomes drawn to the left side and in orde r to prevent this, Israel is obliged to sacrifice a goat in which the serpent delighted, lets go his hold o f that luminary that then begins to shine and daily increase in light an d splendour. Thus on the day of atonement when the serpent or Evil One is engaged with the goat offered unto it, the moon freed from its evil influence undertakes t o defend and protect Israel as a mother watches over the safety and welfare of her child. Then it is that the Holy One grants his blessings with remission and pardon of sins. During the Feast of Tabernacles the influence of the righ t side of the Sephirotic tree so attracts the moon that she attai ns its fulness and heavenly blessings are showered upon the tutelary guardians of pagan nations on earth in order to pre clude them from imagining they have any right to sh are in those that are reserved and allotted to Israel. During it s rise and fall the visible disk of the moon symbol ises those blessings that are bestowed upon Israel, but the ob scured part, those of idolatrous nations. When the moon however is at the full, Israel receives and profits from th e full tide of blessings from heaven and therefore it is written \"On the eighth day64a-64b Num. 29:35 there shall be an \"abzereth\" amongst you (Num. XXVIII. 15) the word abzereth here meaning a s the Targum translates it \"a reunion\" in order that the divine in all their fulness and extent may descend upon Israel as a whole. On this day, Israel prays to the Holy One fo r the blessing of rain not only for themselves but also all other nations. This feast peculiar to Israel is referred to in the words of scripture \"My beloved is mine an d I am his\"Cant. 2:16 or its attendant blessings are shared in by no other nation; in the dispensing of which the Holy One is like unto a King who invites his friends to a banquet on a ce rtain day. After reflection, the monarch says to hi mself, \"I wish to enjoy myself with the company of my friends but in sending invitations to my governors, and chiefs and rulers of provinces I am afraid these will be so numerous as to interfere with and lessen my enjoyment.\" What di d the King do? He first regaled his official guests with the u sual meats and vegetables, and after their departur e well filled and satisfied, he sat down at the table laden with the best and most delicious viands and after his friend s had feasted p. 270 thereon, he further added to their pleasure by gran ting the requests they made unto him and so the ban quet passed off pleasantly and without any exhibition of ill-fe eling or discontent. In a similar manner the Holy O ne acts with Israel and therefore scripture saith, \"on the eight h day shall be your abzereth (coming together) that is, for the reception of blessings to be participated in only b y yourselves.\" Amongst the requisites used during t he Feast of Tabernacles, were the palm and the citron. During e very day of the feast, Jews with a citron in their left hand and in their right a bundle of branches viz.: one of the p alm tree and two of the willow and myrtle, pass aro und the altar exclaiming seven times,64b in memory of the conques t of Jericho and hence called the Great Hosanna. In preparing the Loulab, the stem of the branches was covered ov er with palm leaves. If it was dry or withered, cro oked or split in the least, it was considered worthless. It must be fresh and green, smooth and without burr or blemish . It was encircled with sprigs of willow and myrtle each of which must have three leaves otherwise the Loulab w as Posoul. Then said Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jose to the stranger , \"This; has indeed been a most pleasant and intere sting journey; blessed are they who delight to study the Secret Do ctrine.\" Then embracing him, Rabbi Jose exclaimed, \"Surely thou art of the number of those referred to in Scri pture \"And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the abundance of their peace\" (Ps. LIV. 14 ). Proceeding on their way, they at last sat down a nd rested themselves. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Next: Chapter XLVII. A Vexata Questio In Biblical P hilology \"A VEXATA QUESTIO IN BIBLICAL PHILOLOGY.\" The stranger began speaking again. \"Know you,\" said he, \"why the sacred name I. H. V. H. is found ment ioned in the verse, \"Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and Gomo rrah brimstone and fire from heaven\" (Gen. XIX. 24) instead of the divine name Alhim which is exclusive ly used in connection with the account of the delug e? Listen to the explanation handed down by tradition through th e masters of the Secret Doctrine. Wherever the name Jehovah is found in Scripture it designates the Holy One sitti ng and presiding over the members of his executive tribunal of justice. But when Alhim is used, it refers to his t ribunal only. At the destruction of these two citie s involving but a small part of the world, Jehovah acted along p. 271 with his judicial executive whilst at the deluge wh en the whole world perished only the members of it were concerned in carrying out the divine decrees. If it is objected, that the whole world of human beings was not destroyed, inasmuch as Noah and his family were pre served from perishing, what differentiates the puni shment of the deluge from that inflicted upon Sodom and Gomor rah. Our reply is, that Noah by his entry and inclu sion in the ark became sequestered from mankind as a whole whic h was destroyed by the operation of the Alhim, whil st the overthrow of the cities of the plain was accomplish ed openly by Jehovah in concert with His celestial tribunal. The mystery of this difference is referred to in th e words \"the Lord was seated at the time of the flo od\" (Ps. XXIX. 10). What does the word yeshab (was seated) really mean? but that He was alone and by himself at the t ime the deluge occurred; which interpretation unless corrob orated by other texts in scripture, we would not ha ve dared to apply to the Divine Being and therefore conclude th at the Holy One was not conjoined with the members of his justiciary tribunal, the Alhim in the destruction o f the world by the deluge. That this view is correc t is further proved by the use of the word yasheb in Lev. XIII, 46. \"He shall dwell alone (yasheb) without the camp shall be his habitation.\" Thus it was that Noah hidden in the ar k, escaped the general destruction and after divine justice had been appeased, we read that then the Alhim remember ed or thought of Noah (Gen. VIII. 1). From these re marks we infer that the Holy One punishes sometimes openly a nd sometimes in secret, openly when acting with and through the Alhim whose jurisdiction extends over and throu ghout the world--secretly when sitting in that cele stial sphere whence descends all the blessings of heaven. Knowin g this we can understand why the precious goods a m an hides are sources of blessings, whilst those that are vis ible and perceived by all excite envy and covetousn ess through the influence of the demon known as Ra-ain (evil eye).\" 1 As the stranger ceased speaking Rabbi Jose was deli ghted and exclaimed, \"blessed are we students of Ra bbi Simeon through whose teachings and instruction we have bee n able to understand and comprehend what has just b een imparted to us. Truly this stranger has been divine ly directed and sent to64b instruct us in the Secre t Doctrine concerning truths and teachings p. 272 the most ennobling and sublime.\" On reaching the dw elling of Rabbi Simeon they related to him all that the stranger has said unto them whereon after listening to them he replied, \"well and truly hath the stranger spoke n.\" Footnotes 271:1 This opinion is frequently expressed in the Talmud : see Tract Baba Bathra fol. 6. Next: Chapter XLVIII. Kabbalistic Explanation of th e Goat Azazel \"KABBALISTIC EXPLANATION OF THE GOAT AZAZEL.\" Rabbi Eleazar whilst sitting in presence of his fat her Rabbi Simeon, spake and said, \"the demon called 'the end of all flesh' doth it take pleasure and receive any advant age from the sacrifices of Israel or not?\" Whereupon Rabbi Simeon replied \"Yea truly, both hea ven above and earth below are benefited. Observe th at priests (cohanim) Levites and Israel are collectively terme d Adam when imbued with the same holy will and desi re to, offer up a sacrifice either of a sheep, an ox or any othe r animal. Before so doing,64b-65a however, they mus t make confession and expiate their sins of word, though a nd deed, for then only are sacrifices of any avail and become charged with the sins confessed as was the case wit h the Azazel or scapegoat driven forth into the wil derness bearing the sins of the congregation of Israel, as it is written--'and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions , putting them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.'\" (Lev. XVI . 21). It is the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"same with other sacrifices. When placed upon the al tar they become charged with the good deeds and tho ughts, as also of the sins and evil thoughts of the sacrifice r, each of them ascending to its own appropriate pl ace on high and distinguished as emanations from a man's higher sel f and denominated Adam or from his animal or lower nature and called \"behemoth\" (beastly). This distinction is re ferred to in scripture, \"Thou savest both man (adam ) and beast.\" (Ps. XXXVI. 6). Offerings of unleavened cakes and a ll other comestibles, are for attracting the Holy S pirit and inducing it to operate through the service of the p riest, the chanting of Levites and the prayers of t he worshippers. In the oil and wheat of such offerings, none of the ex peditive angels of retribution can participate so t hat they are unable to acid to the severity of their afflicting judgments, being attracted for the time being by th e offerings of animals. This is why sacrifices of both kinds take place at one and the same time, in accordance with the injunctions of the Secret p. 273 [paragraph continues] Doctrine that gratitude and thankfulness the true elements of65a every oblation and sacrifice may ascend on high pure and sincere before the Almi ghty and thus obtain responsive blessings. Next: Chapter XLIX. Rabbi Simeon's Reflections on t he Supreme and Its Union with Human Souls \"RABBI SIMEON'S REFLECTIONS ON THE SUPREME AND ITS UNION WITH HUMAN SOULS.\" Said Rabbi Simeon, during prayer, I raise my hands on high as a token and expression of the gratitude of my will nature that goeth up to the almighty supreme Being whose essence is Will infinite and beyond all human comprehension. He is the great Beginning, the myste ry of all mysteries. All created things in the univ erse are but emanations from Him who is the height of height tha t neither man nor angel can approach unto, nor hath ever seen or can see its origin and source. In vain the mind of man attempts to fly towards the omnipotent Will Being of which it is a fraction infinitesimal and infinitely small . Vain are all efforts to grasp and comprehend Thou ght Supreme and eternal, as we sink confounded, overwhelmed with fe elings of awe ineffable. Yet though the height Divi ne remains eternally invisible to human vision, it manifests i ts presence and operates within the minutes and hou rs chiefly within the soul of man with whose natural light it blends whenever its aspirations and thoughts tend t owards and are centered on the great source of all being and creat ion, the primal light that enlighteneth every man t hat cometh into the world. Between the enlightened human soul and t he great Beginning are nine palaces or grades of ev olutionary development two Kabbalah are designated Sephiroth w hose culmination is Kether or The Crown. These grad es, palaces or sephiroth call them as we may, are not e ntities but modes or stages of ascent towards union with the Divine Will and their respective lights are but the luminous reflection of the Divine Thought. Though nine in number, they are really one in this sense, they are derivations of the great Thought without which the y could not exist and can never be but imperfect and obscure re presentations of the Divine Entity that must remain always unknown in its sublimity and transcendency beyond a ll human comprehension. Through these palaces the enlightened soul enters by continuous aspirations a nd thus they become the intermediaries to it betwee n the known and unknown, between the comprehensible and the inc omprehensible. Within them are hidden all the great spiritual mysteries and realities that to humanity p. 274 as at present must remain objects of faith rather t han of reason65a and intellectual perception. Only by the enlightened soul can they become cognised in its gr adual ascension through them on its way to the grea t and transcendent Being termed The Eternal, The Everlast ing One. But this cannot be effected only as it bec omes receptive of and imbued with the light and splendor of the Sephiroth Binah (Doctrine Intelligence) by which it is brought into union with the Divine and enters into the enjoyment of the Beatific Vision. From these ob servations we are better able to understand and penetrate into th e meaning and mysteries of sacrifices in general wh ich as mere rites and ceremonies have no intrinsic efficacy. On ly when they are the expression of the soul, gradua lly becoming purified and enlightened by and through its higher self are they a means of spiritual ascension in the divine life which is the true light of mankind assimilating and bringing it into closer relationship with the divi ne, Eternal I Am in whose presence there is fulness of joy and at wh ose right hand there are pleasures forevermore. Next: Chapter L p. 275 65a THIS union and harmony between the finite and the i nfinite, God and man is the highest and deepest of mysteries, the mystery of all ages since the creation of the w orld. Happy are they in this world and the world to come who have attained unto a knowledge of it. Observe furthermor e that the destroying angel known as \"the end of al l flesh\""},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"derives benefit and pleasure from acts of charity i n this sense, that as such acts and deeds of charit y and gratitude are a source of joy to the angels on high, so the mater ial part of sacrifices symbolising the element of t he impurity and imperfection of human nature becomes a source of st rength and enjoyment to the inferior orders of spir its and this being the case, the Holy Spirit Israel's Watcher th at neither slumbers nor sleeps, provides against th eir troubling her children and preventing their good deeds from becom ing perfect and freed from impure thoughts. At the rising of the moon in the early part of each month a goat is offered up as a supplementary sacr ifice which the demon delighting in, cease for the time being from troubling Israel who is thus a ble to make its offerings in peace that bring them into closer relationship with their Lord and King. As a he-goat is what demons delight in, so is Israel the delight and choice of the Holy One as stated in scripture \"for the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto him self and Israel for his peculiar treasure\" (Ps. CXXXV . 4). Still further, \"the end of all flesh\" joys on ly in what is carnal and when he acquires power and influence over any one, it is ov er his animal or lower nature and not over his high er self. This is spiritual and celestial in origin, that is earthly in its production. So is it with the two elements o r parts in a sacrifice; like goeth to like, the material part remaineth bel ow, take spiritual part ascendeth on high. When any one lives the p. 276 higher and diviner life, there is a continual sacri fice, that in a measure atones for the sins of huma nity in general, whereas the life of an iniquitous man is of no bene fit or advantage whatever65a-65b to the world or it is blemished with sin and wrong doing and therefore it is writte n, \"Whatsoever hath a blemish ye shall not offer, f or it will not be acceptable\" (Lev. XXII. 20)Lev. 22:25. From what ha s been said we can understand and gather the true m eaning of sacrifice and how the lives of good men subserve to the benefit and salvation of humanity. Next: Chapter LI. The Occult Meaning of the Six Hun dred Years of Noah's Life THE OCCULT MEANING OF THE SIX HUNDRED YEARS OF NOAH 'S LIFE. Referring again to the words \"And Alhim said unto N oah, the end of all flesh is before me,\" Rabbi Sime on spake and said: \"These words mean that the destroying ang el presented himself before the Holy One, demanding power and authority to mark for destruction the race of t he antediluvians. We further read, 'And behold! I w ill destroy them with the earth' (Gen. VI. 13). make thee an ark of gopher wood wherein entering thou mayst be preserve d, and he may have no power over thee. And Noah did according to all that Alhim commanded him, \"and in the six h undredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seven teenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened\" (Gen. VII. 11). These words imply that only in that year of his earth life and incarnation, did No ah attain unto human perfection and by thus becomin g a just man and perfect, was able to escape the doom impending over the wicked generation in which he lived, whose iniquity had then reached its climax. When Noah had attained unto this age, then the forbearance and long suffe ring of the Holy One ended and the destruction so long deferred overwhelmed the world and the race of the antedilu vians was suddenly swept out of existence from off the face o f the earth. Note the words, 'Behold I (ani) even I (hinneni) do bring a flood of waters upon the earth.' Wherefore the repetition of the personal pronoun, the one bei ng the synonym of the other? It is because wherever in scripture A ni (I) is found it is used to designate God and hav ing the same relation to Him as the soul has to the body. Thus i t is written, 'I (ani) will make my covenant with t hee' (Gen. xvii. 4), implying p. 277 that God sometime or other will manifest himself an d make himself known to mankind. Again, why is it w ritten, 'Ath hammabbul mayin' (the deluge of waters), becau se thereby to show by the word 'ath' that in additi on to the waters of the deluge, Alhim sent the angel of death to destroy the world and gave him authority to acc omplish it by the element of water. We know also from tradition t hat the words 'I (ani) am the Lord' have the same m eaning as, I am faithful in my promises of recompense to the rig hteous, as also in my denunciations of punishment o n the wicked in the world to come, and all are made under the name of Ani. The additional words 'to destroy all flesh' also imply that the death angel is the real destroyer of the world and is alluded to as such in (Ex. xii. 2 3). 'And He will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses t o smite you.' That is to say, that the destroyer, w ho in the account of the deluge is designated 'the end of all flesh' shall have no power over you, nor authority to affl ict and injure you. All this occult teaching in the secret doctrine res pecting the deluge was imparted to me by Rabbi Issa c.\" Next: Chapter LII. Adam Sitting at the Gate of the Garden of Eden "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ADAM SITTING AT THE GATE OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN. On another occasion Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"I t is written, 'I said, I shall not see the Lord eve n the Lord in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants65b Isa. 38:11 of the world' (Ps. xxxviii. 11). How gre at the number of those who are ignorant and take no interest in the secret doctrine. They expend their strength and ene rgy in the acquisition of worldly knowledge, oblivi ous altogether of that true wisdom which is both spiritual and div ine. When a man departs out of earth life, he has t o account for every act and deed committed in it and meets many w ith whom he has been acquainted and held intercours e in the world. Eventually he beholds Adam seated at the Gar den of Eden rejoicing over those who have faithfull y observed and kept the divine commandments. Surrounding him a re the righteous who were wise and avoided walking in the way that leads down to Gehenna and found the path o f light. Such are termed by scripture 'inhabitants of the world' hadel, not haded. The inhabitants of this latter ar e mouselike in their habits of heaping up riches an d know not who shall enjoy them; but the just and upright are term ed dwellers p. 278 of hadel, which word signifies to shun and avoid, b ecause they have learned to shun the way to death a nd found entrance into the Garden of Eden. Another interpret ation is this: by 'the inhabitants of the world' (h adel) is signified those who through repentance, ceased to do evil and learned to do well, as did Adam who was afterwards appointed leader into Eden of all repentant souls, and thus t ermed inhabitants of hadel, and therefore is it wri tten, 'that I may know what I lack (hadel)' (Ps. xxxix. 5), Note the words, 'I shall not see Jah.' 'Who then is able to see him?'65b-66a the other part of the verse explains, 'Jah in the l and of the living.' When souls encircled with an au ra of light, the result of righteous living, ascend on high to the s phere especially prepared for those who have attain ed unto the higher life, they are then able to gaze into the Zo har, the luminous mirror, or in other words the bea tific vision whose splendor and brightness are reflections from the highest heavenly sphere, since a soul clothed i n any other raiment than this light would be unable to behold a nd endure its intense vibrations. For even as souls in their progress and development on earth life and clothed and girded with an aura, so in the world on high, t hey become encircled with one brighter and still more luminous , by which they are able to contemplate the transce ndent light coming down out of the lightest of the heavenly sph eres known as 'the land of the living.' It was this aura of the higher life encircling him that Moses was able to b ehold what he did, as it is written, 'And Moses wen t into the midst of the cloud (as it seemed to human vision) and asc ended the mount' (Ex. xxiv. 15). That is, he became clothed with an aura of divine light, in order to gaze into the luminous mirror, or beatific vision, similar to tha t which time just or perfected human beings' on their entrance into the higher heavenly spheres are clothed, of which the a ura surrounding them during earth life is only a faint shadow and reflection. We now understand why the wo rd Jah in the verse just cited is found repeated. 'I shall no t see Jah in the land of the living,' were uttered by Hezekiah and mean that he feared and had no hope of ever experie ncing the joy and delight of gazing upon the splend or of the light emanating from 'the land of the living,' thro ugh his dying childless, and therefore he said also, 'I shall not see Adam sitting at the gate of the Garden of Eden on h igh.' But why should he be afraid of this? because Isaiah the prophet had said unto him, 'Thou shalt die, thou sh alt not live,'Is. 38:1 that is, thou shalt not live in the world to come as thou shalt die childless; p. 279 for whoever leaves and quits the world without offs pring is not admitted into the garden of the celest ial Eden and is therefore altogether precluded from contemplating t he glory and splendor of its light. If therefore He zekiah with all the inherited merits of his forefathers, besides be ing an upright and just person, feared lest by dyin g childless, he should fail to attain unto the beatific vision, or enter into 'the land of the living,' so ought he be alarmed who, lacking ancestral merit and virtues,66a transgresses divine laws. The aura surrounding the just and perfected in the world to come who have lived the higher and diviner life is known and designated by initiates of the secret doc trine as 'The Master's Robe.' Happy they who wear it, for it is o n their account the Holy One has reserved and put b y unnumbered joys in the world to come, as it is written, 'For f rom the beginning of the world, men have not heard nor perceived by the ears, neither have seen, Oh God beside thee, wh at thou hast prepared for him that putteth his trus t in Thee.'\" (Ps. lxiv. 4.)Is. 64:4 Next: Chapter LIII. Remarks on the Destroying Angel and the Antediluvians REMARKS ON THE DESTROYING ANGEL AND THE ANTEDILUVIANS. \"'Behold I even I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth,'\" said Rabbi Jehuda. \"These words have reference to the waters of strife (Meribah), when the children o f Israel murmured against the Lord and caused his h oliness to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"appear amongst them. But was this act of insubordin ation and murmuring against God the only occurrence in the history of the children of Israel, that scripture s hould thus characterize it? The fact is, it is reco rded as the occasion Israel afforded to the executors of divine justice of overcoming and afflicting them. For there are wa ters sweet and bitter, waters clear and turbid, waters of peace an d waters of strife, to which scripture alludes as w aters of Meribah where the children of Israel strove with the Lord: that is, they attracted to themselves the impure, u nclean spirit that defiled them (vayiqqadesh bam) (Num. xx. 13). In objecting against this exposition, Rabbi Hezekia h said: \"If your interpretation was correct, the wo rd vayiqadshou (they were deified) would have been used by scriptu re. The true meaning of the words is I think as fol lows: 'He whom the children of Israel should have worshipped and adored became degraded by them, if I may so exp ress it. They became so obdurate p. 280 and wilfully irrational both in mind and heart that the sense of the Divine presence with them became lost and extinguished, as doth the light of the moon at its fall. Therefore as the word vayiqadesh used by scri pture should not be translated in its best sense of being sanctified ; so the words, 'Behold I even I do bring a flood o f waters,' should be understood as meaning, 'I will send unto them th e impure and destroying angel by whom they have all owed themselves to become defiled.'\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Woe unto those who are unwilling to repent of their evil ways and deeds before the H oly One during their life on earth, for if, continuing unre pentant, at the close of66a-66b it, they become cas t into that outer darkness, where their torment ceaseth not and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Observe th at by the open persistence of the antediluvians in their heinous a nd flagitious iniquity they were condemned and puni shed by the Holy One in a remarkable and open manner. Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Even when a man sins in secret, the Holy One is long suffering, and if he repents, has mercy upon and forgives him. On the contrary, if he conti nues in his evil and secret deeds, they become at l ast revealed and manifested and he is punished openly. Of this ordea l of the 'mey hammarim' (bitter waters) is an insta nce. It was so with the antediluvians, and how were they punished? They were exterminated from the face of the earth. The fountains of the great deep became opened and poure d forth rain and mighty volumes of boiling water, s o that their fleshless skeletons only remained to show they had once lived and had totally perished from off the fa ce of the earth.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The words 'and they were destroy ed from the earth' (Gen. vii. 23), have the same me aning as 'let them be blotted out of the book of the living' (Ps. lxix. 28). Thus by the use of the word mahha (blot ted out, destroyed off) in these two passages of scripture w e are taught that the names of the wicked and evil doers are expunged out of the book of life--that they will ne ver use again and appear in the day of judgment. Next: Chapter LIV. Kabbalistic Remarks on the Coven ant or Union of the Higher and Lower Self KABBALISTIC REMARKS ON THE COVENANT OR UNION OF THE HIGHER AND LOWER SELF. Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"It is written, 'But with thee will I establish my covenant' (Gen. vi. 18): as the continuity of the p. 281 covenant or good law on earth is the same as in the higher spheres, we infer from these words that whe n men become just and upright in this world they contribu te to the stability of the good law in both worlds. Said Rabbi Simeon: \"The words just cited have an oc cult meaning. The love of the male for the female i s based upon jealous desire. Observe, when there is a just man in the world, or one whose higher and lower sel f have become harmonized and66b unified, the divine spirit or Shekinah is ever with him and abides in him, causing a feeling of affectionate attachment towards the Holy One to arise similar to that between the male and female. Therefore the words, 'I will establish my covenant with thee' may be rendered thus, 'Because of the un ion between thy higher and lower natures giving rise to a yet d iviner life, I will abide with thee forever. I will never leave nor forsake thee. Come thou therefore into the ark into which no one unless he is just can enter.'\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"As long as this covenant or un ion remains intact and undisturbed between himself and the Holy One, nothing can injure or afflict him. It was so w ith Noah who keeping the covenant was preserved alo ng with his children, whilst the wickedness of the antediluvian s caused them to perish from off the face of the ea rth.\" Rabbi Jehuda whilst on a visit to Rabbi Simeon ente red into a discussion with him as to the meaning of the words 'And Elijah repaired (vayerape) the altar of the Lo rd that was broken down' (I Kings xviii. 30). \"What ,\" said he, \"is the occult meaning of this word vayerape, which lit erally signifies to heal.\""},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"In answer to this Rabbi Simeon remarked: \"Note that in the days of the prophet Elijah all Israel had f orsaken the worship of the Holy One and transgressed against hi s covenant made with their forefathers, to such an extent that it had become altogether forgotten and sunk into obliv ion. Seeing and recognizing this, Elijah brought it back to their remembrance and thus restored it and made known aga in to them the everlasting covenant, and therefore it is written, 'And Elijah took twelve stones according t o the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob;' i mplying by this that it was by the occult virtue of the number twel ve that the altar of the Lord was erected as aforet ime; and then we read further, 'Unto whom the word of the Lord came saying, \"Israel shall be thy name.\"' Why is this na me of Israel here mentioned? Truly because when Israel attaches itself p. 282 and adheres to the good law, it is so called; but w hen they forsake it, they are termed the children o f Israel, or sons of Jacob. This is therefore why the word vayerape i s written, because Elijah causes the covenant to be come a subject of faith with the children of Israel and thus heale d the breach between them and the Holy One and rest ored love and affection between them. Observe further that Phineh as, filled with zeal, inflicted punishment on Zimri and thus helped to reestablish the covenant, and so it is wr itten of him, 'Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace' (Num. xxv. 12). Now it is certain that Phinehas had in no way violated the covenant and needed not this gift . The real meaning is that he prevented it from becoming regar ded as obsolete, a thing of no avail and therefore not worth consideration. For so doing he secured the blessing of the 'Covenant of Peace' the occult significatio n of which is, the mysterious Word, the Mediator between the two w orlds, the celestial and terrestrial, and so it is added, 'And he shall have it and his seed after him, even the cove nant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was z ealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israe l.'\" (Num. xxv. 13.) Said Rabbi Simeon: \"There is no greater transgressi on in the sight of the Holy One than the breaking o f the covenant, as it is written, 'and I will bring a swo rd upon you that shall avenge the breaking of my co venant.'\"66b-67a (Lev. xxvi. 25.) Note that the sin of the antediluv ians reached its climax by the practice of self pol lution, so that the earth itself became corrupted and defiled thereby ( va thishaheth) before God, and for this reason he s aid, 'I will destroy them with the earth (mashitham).' There are , however, some who affirm that the measure of thei r iniquity became full when ignoring all moral right and justi ce; and might with them becoming right they broke t he laws of heaven and earth, of God and humanity, and reaped t heir karma, the executors of which never fail to av enge the wrongdoing of those who infringe the Good Law.\" Next: Chapter LV. Various Kabbalistic Expositions o f Biblical Texts VARIOUS KABBALISTIC EXPOSITIONS OF BIBLICAL TEXTS. Said Rabbi Simeon: \"We read, 'And God said unto Noa h, enter thou and all thy house into the ark.' Wher efore in the narrative of the deluge is the divine name of Alhim used throughout, except in this particular passage in which the sacred p. 283 name I H V H is found. The explanation is this. It is not in accordance with the rules and custom of g ood society for a wife to receive a guest into her home without the consent and permission of her husband, so Noah tho ugh desirous to enter into the ark, it was first of all necessar y that the husband of the ark, designated here by t he Holy Name, representing divine goodness, should give Noah auth ority and permission to do so, and not before this did he enter the ark; and it is added, 'For thee have I seen rig hteous before me in this generation,' from which wo rds we infer that no one should ever be received as a guest in a hous e whose character is blemished and has a stain upon it.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"We find written in scripture, P s. xxiv. 1, 'A psalm of David. The earth is the Lor d's and the fulness thereof, the world and they dwell therein.' We know from tradition that wherever the name Davi d occurs in the psalms, that it was composed by him himself, bu t whenever it precedes a psalm it was composed and written by the aid of the Holy Spirit's influence. The words, 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof' r efer to the land of Israel which is called the Holy Land, whilst 'the f ulness thereof' signifies the Schekina, as it is76a written 'for the glory of the Lord filled errata.htm - 45 the houses of God.' (1 Kings v. 11) Why in this pas sage is the word mla (full) in place of mile (filled). Thereby is meant that th e Schekina was as the light of the moon at its full . The Schekina is full of heavenly blessings as a treasure house is w ith jewels and gold so long as it remains and abide s in the land of Israel which belongs unto the Lord. According to an other exposition these words refer to heaven on hig h wherein the Lord delights to dwell, but 'the fulness (oumlo ah) thereof' are the souls of the righteous filled with the principle of justice, the divine attribute that sustains the universe. Should it however be said, 'Is the earth sustained only by a single pillar?' observe what is written. 'For He la th founded it upon the seas (yammim) and establishe d it upon the floods or rivers (recharoth).' He here refers to th e Holy One, of whom it is written, 'It is He that h ath made us.'

Next: Chapter LVI. The Divine Lehaerot On Ezechiel' s Visions. \"THE DIVINE LEHAEROT ON EZECHIEL'S VISIONS.\" SAID Rabbi Hezekiah: \"The title of one of the Psalm s is thus, 'A psalm of David Maschil' (for understa nding), 'Blessed is he whose transgression is lifted up and whose sin is covered' (Ps. XXXII. 1). This verse h as already been commented on. There is however an occult meaning in the word maschil (understanding), and, having refe rence to divine wisdom, it requires explanation. We learn fr om tradition that King David in composing his hymns and songs of praise to the Holy One, made use of ten differen t meters (one of which is termed (\" maschil \") corresponding to the various progressive states in the divine life symbo lized by the ten sephiroth of the tree of life. In order to attain to these, David prepared and disciplined himself, that he might become receptive of their respective stat es of inspiration and spiritual enlightenment and thus be able to compose his psalms. The meaning of the wor ds, 'blessed is he whose transgression is raised on high' is thi s, when the Holy One places in the scales of his ba lance a man's merits and demerits it sometimes happens that the s cale in which his sins are placed rises, being over balanced by the scale containing his good deeds. Such is the meanin g of these words. Happy they! whose transgression i s forgiven, that is,--when the scale in which it is placed, asc ends. The words 'whose sin is covered' refer to tho se whose sins the Holy One, when his judgments are abroad in the worl d, covers and hides from the view of the destroying angel, as was the case with Noah whom he saved from experienc ing the effects and consequences of the sin that wa s prevalent in the world through p. 285 p. 286 the fall of Adam. As long as sin and wrong-doing su bsist on earth, man suffers, because not in his nor mal and primal sate of innocency. He trembles and flees from befor e wild and savage animals,71a-71b no longer subject to his will and control. When Noah came forth out of the ark, t he world had become cleansed and purified and human ity entered on a new era of existence and therefore it is written, 'And Alhim blessed him and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the ea rth.'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"Though in these words no mentio n or reference is made to his wife and his sons; wi ves, yet are they included in, the term 'vaathem' (and ye), as a lso in the word 'ath' before the name of Noah which includes both males and females, both being subjects and recipien ts of divine benedictions. Then was it the Holy One gave unto them the seven precepts to be observed as rules of life until Israel should stand before Mount Sinai a nd receive the full law.\" Next: Chapter LVII. The Mystery of the Bow in the C loud \"THE MYSTERY OF THE BOW IN THE CLOUD.\" \"It is written, and Alhim said, This is the token o f the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creation that is with you for perpetual generations , I do set (nathati) my bow in the cloud! (Gen. IX. 12. 13). The word ' nathati ' here refers to the past, as the bow from the days of Adam had always been witnessed in the clouds. I n his further comments on these words Rabbi Simeon sa id: 'In the vision of Ezechiel we read, \"And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likene ss of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire sto ne\" (Ez. I. 21)Ez. 1:26. Preceding these words, scripture state s, 'I heard the noise of their wings, like the nois e of great waters, as the voice of Shaddai (Almighty), the voice of sp eech as the noise of a host, when they stood they l et down their wings.' We have here given a description of the fou r celestial cherubic beings by whom the firmament i s supported. They were all joined together by their wings which covered their forms. When they extended their wings , they uttered in far resounding tones hymns of praise to the glory of God, that reverberated throughout the universe incessantly. The burthen of their song was, 'The Lo rd hath made known his salvation, his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen' (Ps. XCV III. 2). It is also stated that when they moved, th ere was heard a sound as of a great hostEz. 1:24 on the march, like that of p. 287"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"the celestial angelic host when their legions with united voice, utter their hymns of praise to the Ho ly One, saying, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, all the ear th is full of his glory' (Is. VI. 3). As the four c herubic angels of the heavenly chariot turn to the four quarters of the w orld, their cry is still the same, 'Holy! holy! hol y!' Above them is the glittering firmament, whose cardinal quarters r eflect the image of each of their forms when turned towards them, as also the colors peculiar to each of them. They a re the forms of a lion, an ox, an eagle and a man. In three of these, the human countenance is so prominent, that the lio n resembles a lion man and so with the two others, that are termed the eagle man, the ox man, and thus as scrip ture71b states, 'They four had the face of a man.'E z. 1:10 As the firmament was above them it not only reflected thei r forms but also the colors peculiar to each of the m and that correspond to the four letters of the sacred name I . H. V. H. and visible to man, as green, red, white and blue, and which when refracted form twelve different shades a nd hues, and therefore it is stated, 'as the appear ance of the bow that is in the cloud, in the day of rain, so was th e appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lo rd' (Ez. I. 28). This then is the mystical meaning of the words, 'I do se t my bow in the cloud.' The term 'my bow' has the s ame signification as that which was said of Joseph. 'Th is bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, fro m thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel' (Gen . XLIX. 24). As Joseph was a just man, it is said of him, 'He pl aced his bow in God', that is the covenant, symboli zing equally the bow and the Only Just One, these two signifying bot h one and the same thing. Noah being also a just ma n, the covenant made with him was symbolized by the bow an d the arms of his hands were made strong (vayapozow ). This word refers to the light proceeding from the bow of the covenant which is the source of joy and happin ess to all the world and of which it is written, 'More to be desir ed is it than gold, yet than much fine gold, sweete r also than honey and the honey comb' (Ps. XIX. 10). This light was t he cause of Joseph's mental and spiritual illuminat ion, and therefore is he known as and termed, 'Joseph the up right!' It is termed the bow of the covenant, as th e ray in the how though refracted in three others is one way, so is the celestial light reflected downward by the firma ment supported by the four cherubic forms of the heavenly or divin e chariot. Therefore p. 288 is it forbidden to gaze at the rainbow that appears in the heaven because thereby the Schekina of whic h it is an image is profaned. As the great archangels standing in pr esence of the Holy One71b-72a bow their heads, not daring to regard the divine majesty, so on the appearance of the bow in the heavens ought we to bend ourselves w ith feelings of reverence and worship of the Divine Being. When it appears, the earth feels assured that the lost h armony between the celestial and terrestrial worlds has be en restored. We have already observed that it consi sts of a ray of light composed of three other rays blended and conj oined as one, forming a mystery only dimly percepti ble to initiates of the hidden wisdom. It is further added , 'and above the firmament that was over their head s was the likeness of a throne as of the appearance of a sapp hire stone' (Ez. I. 26). This stone is the central point (shethiya) of the whole world and is the basis of the Holy of Hol ies in the sanctuary at Jerusalem. This foundation stone is the sacred celestial throne placed above the four cheru bic beings whose forms are engraved on the four sid es of the heavenly or divine chariot and symbolized the tradi tional law. 'And upon the throne was the likeness a s the appearance of a man upon it,' symbolizes of the wri tten law. Hence we conclude it is to be observed an d regarded as higher and superior to the traditional. This throne being the foundation stone, Jacob who is the image of the man beheld in vision by the prophetic seer Ezechiel, pl aced his head upon it ere he went to sleep in Bethe l.

Rabbi Jehuda's Discussion with the Merchant, on Jacob's Pillar \"RABBI JEHUDA'S DISCUSSION WITH THE MERCHANT, ON JAC OB'S PILLAR.\" RABBI JEHUDA, whilst staying at an inn in the town of Masheya, rose up at midnight in order to meditat e and study the secret doctrine. In the same apartment th ere happened to be sleeping a Jewish merchant who h ad come thither to dispose of two bales of wearing apparel. 72a Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"It is written, 'and this st one which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house (Beth Alhim). ' The stone here mentioned is the foundation stone at the center of the world, and also on it the sanctuary was built.\" The merchant on bearing these words raised himself from his Led. and said: \"What you have just observe d is an impossibility, for this foundation stone existed be fore the creation of the world and the origin of it . Now the words, 'And this stone which I have set up for a pillar, s hall be God's house' refer distinctly to the partic ular stone that Jacob then set up, and to none other. More than this, it is said, 'And took the stone that he had put for hi s pillow and set it up for a pillar.' But Jacob was then in Bethel; how could this stone therefore be one and the same wit h that at Jerusalem on which the sanctuary was built!\""},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Without taking any notice of the merchant's remarks and question, Rabbi Jehuda, proceeded: \"It is writ ten said he, 'Prepare to meet thy God, oh Israel' (Amos IV. 12) 'Take heed and hearken, oh Israel' (Deuter.

Because so, I rose from my be d to engage in its study with earnestness and attention. We are taught that the Schekina associates with anyone wh o is an earnest student of truth even though he be alone and far re mote from his fellows. Knowing this, how could I re main in bed while sensing the presence of the divine Schekina, and knowing also that the Holy One walks in the gar den of the celestial Eden with the righteous who listen attent ively to the words and meditations of those who ris e at midnight and devote themselves to the study of the law until the dawn of day. Repeat now I pray thee thy object ions and questions.\" Said the merchant: \"My question was this, How can y ou truly affirm that the foundation stone at the ce nter of the world and forming the base of the sanctuary at Jeru salem was one and the same as that which Jacob used as a pillow and afterwards set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He was at Bethel and the foundat ion stone was in Jerusalem, so that your affirmation respecting it w as an inexactitude. Next: Chapter LIX. The Symbolism of the Foundation Stone \"THE SYMBOLISM OF THE FOUNDATION STONE.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"During the night that Jacob sle pt at Bethel, there was a marvelous replication of the earth's surface so that the foundation stone under the sanc tuary in Jerusalem occupied the place where Jacob w as, in order that he might rest his head upon it. This explains how it was that the stone was under him. Ah! replie d the merchant, but scripture explicitly states that Jacob took the stone that he put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and said, 'This stone which I have72a set up for a pillar sha ll be Bethel.' There is here nothing to warrant you r assertion that it was the foundation stone on which the world and the Holy of Holies are based. Then said Rabbi Jehuda, \"If you can give any other explanation of the words, I pray you to give it.\" Said the merchant, \"It is written, 'As for me I wil l behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be sati sfied when I awake with thy likeness' (Ps. XVII. 15). All the love and desire of David was concentrated on this foundatio n stone, which is justice or righteousness, and speaks of it as 'T he stone which the builders rejected has become the headstone of the corner' (Ps. CXVIII. 22). p. 292 [paragraph continues] When David desired to contemplate and behold the g lory72a-72b of his Lord, he first took this stone and possessed himself of it, after which he w as able and qualified to enter into the sanctuary; for everyone who earnestly desires to come into the presence of his Lord, it is impossible to do so unless he possesses this stone, as it is written, 'with this (bezoth) shall Aaron come in to the holy place' (Lev. XVI. 3). David was therefo re congratulating himself when he said, 'As for me, I will behold thy face with justice,' of which the fo undation stone was a symbol, and which he so ardently desired to p ossess. Observe, Abraham instituted the morning pra yer and made known the goodness and benignity of his Lord, so that the matutinal hour became reg arded as most suitable for addressing vows to the Divine Being, and it is written, 'And Abraham rose up early in the morning' (Gen. XXII. 3). Evening prayer, ' minhah ,' was established by Isaac who taught the world th at justice exists, and also that there is a judge by whom it is administered. Jacob originate d nightly prayer, that had never been uttered and a ddressed to heaven by anyone anterior to him, and therefore in a moment of self-commendation said, 'This stone whi ch I have set up as a pillar.' What is the real signification of this word pillar (matzebah)? It refers to the f oundation stone of the universe, namely, justice that had been thrown down by the wickedness of mankind. It was Jacob who rai sed it again and his pouring of oil on the top of it denotes tha t he, more than any other, contributed in re-erecti ng it and causing its existence to become regarded as a reality. Rabbi Jehuda, as the merchant ceased speaking, rose and embracing him said: 'How is it, that possessed of such knowledge of the secret doctrine, thou art engaged in worldly pursuits to the neglect of things appert aining to the higher and diviner life?\" Said the merchant: \"It is through necessity. I have two sons attending school for whose maintenance an d education I have to provide in order that they may become incul cated in the secret and hidden wisdom.\" Again the m erchant spake and said: \"We read, 'and Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father and his kingdom was est ablished"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"greatly' (I. Kings II. 12). How great the encomium of Solomon as expressed in these words, implying th at he set up the foundation stone (shethiya) on which he erected the sanctuary in Jerusalem and thereby established his kingdom greatly, as it is stated. We read, 'And the bow sha ll be in the cloud and I will look upon it, that I may p. 293 remember the everlasting covenant' (Gen. IX. 16), f rom which we gather that the bow gives rise to feel ings of delight to the Holy One. No man in whom the divine light is not reflected, can ever enter into the pre sence of his Lord. The words 'And I will look upon it' (urithiha ) have the same occult meaning as, 'The Lord said u nto him, go through the midst of the city,72b through the midst of Jerusalem and mark the letter Th (thau) upon the foreheads of the men who sigh,' (Ez. IX. 3) from which we learn that God looks upon the face of every man to observ e if this than is impressed thereon and if so he remembers th e everlasting covenant. Another exposition of these words is, that they refer to the holy sign impressed on the h uman form. Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"All you have said, is quite cor rect. The origin of the bow visible in the heavens involves a profound mystery. When Israel returns out of captiv ity, the bow that then will be visible, will be as radiant and beautiful as a bride, adorned for her husband on he r marriage day.\" \"Listen,\" said the merchant, \"to the words of my fa ther, addressed to me just before his death, 'Never expect to behold the banner of Messiah until the bow appears in the heavens, flashing forth rays and colors of l ight so transcendently glorious and splendid, that the shee n of it will lighten up the whole world. When this happens then look for Messiah. We learn this from the esoteric m eaning of the words, 'I will look upon the bowGen 9 :16 and remember the everlasting covenant.' At present it a ppears in colors, faint and lustreless and only as an object to remind us that the Holy One will never again destro y mankind by a deluge of waters. When however the a dvent of Messiah occurs, it will appear radiant in all its b eauty and splendor and God will then remember Israe l and raise them out of the dust, as it is written, 'And they s hall serve the Lord and David, their king, whom I w ill raise up unto them.' (Jer. XXX. 9), 'And in that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen' (Amos I X. 11), that is, in the day that the resplendent bow appears in the hea vens, God will look upon it and remember his covena nt, so that David, becoming reincarnated, shall appear again an d reign in Israel.' This is what my father declared and his belief is confirmed by the words, 'For as in the days of N oah, so have I done unto thee and as I have sworn t hat the waters of Noah should go no more over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee nor repro ach thee.'\" (Is. LIV. 8). Next: Chapter LX. Rabbi Simeon on Mysteries and the Higher Life p. 294 p. 295 \"RABBI SIMEON ON MYSTERIES AND THE HIGHER LIFE.\" \"AND the sons of Noah that went forth of the ark we re72b Shem, Ham and Japhet\" (Gen. IX. 18). Said Rab bi Eleazer: Why are these names only mentioned? Had No ah other sons who did not go with him on his exit f rom the ark? In reply Rabbi Abba said: \"Noah had other children than the three mentioned in scripture, who likewise had children of their own, and the reason this is not explicitly stated is, that grandchildren are in scripture cla ssed and referred to as sons.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"Had I been incarnated and lived on earth at the time when the Holy One entrusted t he Book of Mysteries containing the secret doctrine to Enoch a nd Adam, I would have strongly urged that the conte nts of it should never be divulged save to those who by their upright and unselfish lives had rendered themselve s worthy to receive and understand them; for such only are able to appreciate their value and importance that dist inguish it from all other books. The truly wise in this world are t hey who attain to a comprehension and understanding of its esoteric teachings that under the veil of symbols, emblems, allegories and enigmas, are concealed from esoteric students whose thoughts and labors are concentrated and dire cted merely towards what is phenomenal and ephemera l. Known only to sages and initiates are the grand mys teries of the hidden wisdom, the knowledge of which they never impart to the 'profanum vulgum' and use only in min istering to the welfare of humanity. Of these great mysteries, one of the most abstruse and profound is contained in the above cited verse of scripture. When the div ine life or in other words, the consciousness of the Divine, the c ause of all cause, the life of all life, the plerom a of all joy and happiness rises and dawns within the human soul or man's lower nature, like the great orb of day p. 296 sending forth its effulgent rays of light and warmt h, it diffuses within it and makes itself recognize d by a feeling, a sensation of enjoyment and delight greater than tha t which rich and generous wine causes the heart of man to pulsate with an ecstasy of delight not to be expressed. Thi s effluence of the divine life is intermediate betw een the joy and pleasure that reaches and flows into human nature f rom the celestial and terrestrial planes of existen ce. There are"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"within us two souls or natures, the higher and the lower, blended and united together by the mysteriou s72b-73a Augoides, that corresponds to the upper triad of Se phiroth in the decenary of the human constitution. These three souls, or rather natures, manifest themselves in th eir differing modes and direction, the Higher Self attaching itself and approximating towards its superior principle pr oduces three offspring, symbolized by Noah's sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet, who came forth from the ark; Shem corre sponding to the principle on the right of the Sephi rotic tree, Ham to that on the left, whilst Japhet is the mediu m of connection that like the color of purple is a combination and a reflection of the other two. Ham was the father o f Canaan.Gen. 9:18 He symbolizes the lower or anima l nature of man susceptive of all material and gross influences that trend to the excitation of animal instincts, desires and passions. He was also the father of him who caused the world along with himself to be cursed and the h uman face to become blanched and pale through sorrow and sufferi ng; therefore it is not stated of Shem or Japhet th at they were the father of this or that one. This is also wheref ore it is written, 'And Abram passed through the la nd,' (Gen. XII. 9)12:6 neither abode in it because the patriarchs t hrough their merits and works had not purified it, neither had Israel made known the sacred name so that it was still suf fering under the primal curse pronounced upon the e arth and the serpent, 'Cursed he the ground because of thee, cur sed art thou above all the beasts of the field.'Gen . 3:14, 3:17 And of the land of Canaan it is written, cursed is Cana an, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his bro thers. Furthermore we read, 'These are the three sons of Noah, Shem, H am and Japhet, and of them was the whole earth over spread' (Gen. IX. 19). These words also include within them a great mystery of the heavenly or superior colors , teaching us that though refracted throughout the universe, the divine glory remains ever the same both in heaven a bove and on earth below.\" Next: Chapter LXI. Symbolism of the Colors of the B ow in the Cloud \"SYMBOLISM OF THE COLORS OF THE BOW IN THE CLOUD.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: The three primal colors become differentiated into many shades and hues and, as su ch, are symbols of the divine life and its numerous descend ing grades of holiness that merge and blend imperce ptibly into the evil, just as the animal glides into the vegeta ble rendering it difficult and almost impossible to distinguish where the one ends and the other begins. The colors of th e rainbow have each of them twenty-seven73b differe nt shades and similarly the principle of holiness has the sam e number of descending gradations until it disappea rs into that which is unholy and sinful, indiscernible to the ordinary observer, but clearly perceived an d distinctly cognized by those who have become recipients of divine wisdom. Blessed is the lot of the upright in heart, to whom the Holy One delights to impart it and entrust to them its s ecret teachings. It is of them the psalmist speaks, 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will shew th em his covenant' (Is. XXV. 1). Greatly obligatory u pon everyone is it to meditate upon the glory of his creator, wh o hears and attends to the prayers of all such as w orship and serve him in sincerity of heart, for then blessings are s howered upon them from on high with increasing know ledge of the Holy One who glories in his servants, of whom it is written, 'Thou art my servant, oh Israel in whom I will he glorified.'\" (Is. XLIX. 3). Next: Chapter LXII. The Mystery Of The Cursing Of C anaan By Noah \"THE MYSTERY OF THE CURSING OF CANAAN BY NOAH.\" \"And Noah began to he a husbandman and he planted a vineyard\" (Gen. IX. 20). In their comments on thes e words, Rabbi Jehuda and Rabbi Jose greatly differed, the o ne affirming p. 298 that Noah planted a vine taken from the garden of E den, the other maintaining that he had plucked it b y its roots before entering the ark73a-73b and now planted it i n suitable soil, after which it brought forth grade s, the juice of which after expressing, he drank and became intoxic ated therewith. Said Rabbi Simeon: In this verse is included a frag ment of the hidden wisdom. When Noah, desirous of investigating into the cause of man's fall from his primal state of holy innocence. not with the inten tion of imitating it but of healing the sin of the world, he soon rea lized his inability to achieve his object. He then pressed the juice of the vine in order to ascertain the natural properti es of it, or in other words, he speculated deeply u pon the nature of the Divine Being. His intellectual faculties soon b ecame exhausted and he was as one puzzled and drunk en with thought, and therefore we read 'He drank of the win e and was drunken and lay uncovered in his tent' (G en. IX. 21), that is, on lifting only a corner of the veil that hides divine mysteries from human gaze and catching a glimpse of what is never revealed and imparted save only to th e enlightened and pure in heart, he became mentally stupefied, confused and overwhelmed with the sublimity and gra ndeur of the noumenal world so transcendently beyon d all"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"human cognition and comprehension. This occurred as stated in his own tent (bethok oholoh) the latter word of which written with a final H, which is a feminine p ronominal suffix giving it the same meaning as in t he verse. 'Remove thy way from her (mesleyah) and come not ni gh the door of her house (bethah) (Prov. V. 8 ), from which we learn that the words 'within his tent' refer mys tically to the tent of the wine, or more explicitly still, to divine mysteries. Furthermore we know from tradition that the sin of the sons of Aaron was that of intoxicati on, arising not from the indulgence in wine and strong drink, for h ow was it possible that anyone should bring them in toxicants to drink within the sanctuary even were they so void o f all shame as to desire them. Truly their inebriet y was not owing to drinking wine but from the abuse of the mystical knowledge of which we have just spoken and of whic h scripture states metaphorically, 'They offered strange fire ( ash zarah) before the Lord which he commanded them not' (Lev. X. 1). The words 'strange fire' have here the same significance as, 'That they may keep thee from the strange woman (ashah zarah), from the stranger that flattereth wi th her words' (Prov. VII. 5). p. 299 [paragraph continues] This then was the kind of drunkenness indulged in by Noah as stated and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was 'uncovered in his tent.' This fatuous act of spiritual inebriation enabled his son Ham, the father of Canaan, to acquire certain. esoteric knowledge and occult powers as we have before expla ined, that endowed and invested him with a potency to exercise sway and domination over others, for knowing that Noah was a just and perfect man and that his holiness arose from his chastity, he wickedly deprived him as trad ition informs us73b of his virile power by the infliction of euni chism. Through this heinous indignity committed upo n him it was that Noah said, 'Cursed be Canaan, a servant of ser vants shall he be unto his brethren,' as aforetime it had been said to the serpent, 'Cursed art thou above all the beas ts of the field.' Eventually at the end of the ages , the erring, the sinful and guilty will be saved and become children of the light, but not Canaan whose irreversible do om is absolute and certain perdition and final extinction a fact n ot unknown to those initiated in the teachings of t he secret doctrine. It is written, 'I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me' (Ps. LI. 5). How cautious and ever watchful should every man be, that he sin not befor e the Holy One, lest Cain-like he become branded wi th a mark that can only be effaced after long years of protra cted penance and suffering as stated in scripture, 'For though thou wash thyself with nitre and take thee much soap, ye t is thine iniquity marked before me saith the Lord God' (Jer . II. 22). Observe that when a man transgresses for the f irst time before the holy One, his fault is disting uished on high by a mark which, after a second repetition of it, b ecomes more visible and noticed, but on his further and continuous persistency in evil doing, it abides on him and rem ains ineffaceable, as it is written, 'Thou shalt he soiled with thy iniquity before me.' Note further that when David h ad sinned in acquiring Bathsheba for his wife, he b ecame exceedingly afraid that the mark upon him would abi de forever. The prophet wishing to comfort him said unto him, 'the Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die ' (II. Sam. XII. 13) meaning that the mark on high had become effaced.\" Next: Chapter LXIII. Remarks on Predestination \"REMARKS ON PREDESTINATION.\" Said Rabbi Abba: It has been handed down by traditi on that Bathsheba was predestined from the creation of the world p. 300 to become the wife of David. If so, how was it that the Holy One permitted before becoming so that she should be the spouse of Uriah the Hittite?\" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"The ways and designs o f the Holy One are such that even when a woman is predestined to be the wife of a certain individual, he does not debar her from marrying before meeting and becoming acquainted with him who is fore-ordained to he her husband. When this occurs, the first husband disapp ears in order that she may become united with her future partner in life. God could prevent the first marriage by ca using the death of one who wished to marry a woman destined to beco me the bride of another man, but it is neither the will nor the pleasure of the Holy One that anyone should die bef ore the time fixed for his departure out of earth l ife. Such was the mystery in connection with Uriah and Bathsheba before she became the wife of David. Ponder well an d meditate upon this exposition, and you will become convinced of its correctness. It may be asked why was the Ho ly Land given in patrimony to the Canaanite before the adve nt of the Israelites, but on reflection over what I have just stated, you will find the explanation by following the same line of exposition I have followed in respect to t he marriage of David with Bathsheba. Notwithstanding David's confe ssion and penitence, the consequences of his sins a nd especially those in connection with his marriage wi th Uriah's wife and the remembrance of them were al ways with him, nor was he even able to divest and rid himself of the fear that they would be visited upon him in times of danger and suffering.

He acquired authori ty and renown by wearing the primogenital robes and garmen ts of Adam and was able thus to corrupt the minds a nd habits of mankind in his days. Said Rabbi Eleazer: \"Nimrod first led men into erro r and caused them to fall into idolatry. Having pos sessed himself of the habiliments of his ancestor Adam, he usurped rule and authority over his fellows who submissive ly yielding to his tyranny made him the object of their worship and adoration. Why was he called Nimrod? Because h e rebelled 1 against the Lord, the most high King of Heaven, an d brought about a revolt in both worlds, the celest ial and terrestrial. Becoming regarded as an universal sove reign and succeeding in wielding; the minds of mank ind, he induced then to cease and discontinue their allegia nce to their Lord and creator.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"Initiates of the secret doctrin e recognize in the expression 'Adam's habiliments,' a very deep and occult mystery, the explanation of which is nev er divulged or imparted save to advanced students o f the Hidden Wisdom.\" Footnotes 301:1 \"to rebel\" = \u0001מרד\u0001 ; Nimrod = \u0001נמרד\u0001 --JBH. Next: Chapter LXV. The Thaumaturgical Erection of S olomon's Temple \"THE THAUMATURGICAL ERECTION OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE.\" \"It is written, 'And the whole earth was of one lan guage and of one speech' (Gen. XI. 1). Said Rabbi S imeon, 'Scripture relates of Solomon's temple, it was buil t of stones made ready before brought to the house. so that the sound of hammer, nor axe, nor of any tool of iron w as heard whilst it was building' (1 King VI. 7). Wh at is the meaning of the words, 'whilst it was building?' Fro m the form of expression, we might infer p. 302 it was in some marvelous and wonderful manner self- builded. Were not Solomon and his artizans the buil ders of it? Ere replying to these questions let us give the mys tical meaning of the words, 'And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work shall the candlestick be made' (Ex. XXV. 31). Now since the candlestick was to be made of beaten gold, and scripture distinctly states, it was 'self-made' (yerechah) how could this possibly be? Our answer is, it was done by the operation of an unknown and invisible force or power, in other words by a mirac ulous agency. When the artisans of Solomon wished to begin their labors, he instructed them to do work to which they had never been accustomed and of which they were wholly ignor ant, so that it was only through the blessing of th e Holy One, with wisdom and power from on high directing their hands, that they were able to begin and complete th e structure of the holy temple, and therefore it was as scriptu re states, \"and the house when it was being self-bu ilt \" (vehabeth behibbanothou) through divine power and influence o perating in the minds or wills and hands of the art isans who worked according to a plan or a certain method, fro m which they never deviated until the temple was fi nished and completed.74a It is also said, it was made of stone ready prepared (shelemah) (which against the gener al rule is written without the yod) 1 . This strange marvel is further confirmed by the word next following, massang (brought or conducted thither) indicating that the artisans engaged in the construction of the house simply use d or made passes with their hauls and the work was accomplish ed though they understood not, nor comprehended the mystery of its modus operandi. It was further stated, 'Ther e was neither hammer, nor axe nor any tool of iron used in the house while it was building itself.' No wonder ther efore is it that whilst wielding, controlling and m anipulating such a mysterious and occult power and agent they observ ed the strictest silence and refrained from the use of tool and implement in the erection of the sacred temple. How deep and occult are the mysteries of the secret do ctrine and few are there who have any notion or idea and knowledge of them. When the Holy One wishes to manifest his glory and power to humanity, he causes to descend from a part of the universe termed the 'thought sphere,' whose locus is"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"unknown, save to himself, and pass through the bodi ly organ known as the 'larynx,' the mysterious brea th of life which is designated in scripture and described as ' the living God,' 'the only true God and King eterna l.'\" Footnotes 302:1 shelemah = \u0001שלימה\u0001 , without the Yod = \u0001שלמה\u0001 = Solomon--JBH. Next: Chapter LXVI. The Mystery of the Logos p. 303 \"THE MYSTERY OF THE LOGOS.\" The three primordial elements of nature are fire, air and water.this se ction omitted from Soncino Really they are one in use and substance and are able to change the one into the other. It is the same with Thought and Sp eech and Logos, they are one and the same in themselves. The ir seeming duality arises from the different aspect s in which they are observed and cognized. That Jacob might be come a perfect man it was necessary that the Divine Being should manifest himself to him by the Word or Logos , even as a man in order to make known his thoughts and ideas to another is obliged to clothe them with words in order that the sound produced by the motion of his lips may make them known to his listener, otherwise they would re main unknown and he incommunicable, so in order tha t the sanctuary of God might exist upon earth, it needed manifestation by means of a Word or Logos, through which it might communicate and speak to mankind. Scripture t herefore states, whilst the house was building itse lf, and not whilst it was building, alluding mystically to the manner of divine manifestation by the Logos in the world. The mystery of the erection of the temple is hinted at in the words, 'Go forth ye daughters of Zion and be hold King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him on the day of his espousals' (Cant. III. 11). Respecting the stones used in building the sanctuary, it is sa id of them they were 'prepared' (massang) which als o signifies 'carried or transported thither or taken from one p lace to another.' As thought existing in the Sphere of Mind becomes transformed into vocal speech by descending into the larynx, the ultimate stage for its manife station in its downward flight from on high, so is it with the Div ine Word or Logos and its silent entrance in the mi nd and soul of man, descending from on high through inferior degre es and states or worlds of being, each working and operating in harmony with it under the control of the great supr eme ruler and architect of the universe, and each o bedient to the law of evolution for the accomplishment of its dest iny, unification with the Divine. Slowly and in sil ence, the innumerable majestic worlds careering in their orbi ts throughout the boundless realms of space under t he dominance and guidance of an almighty principle of unity, are progressing and approximating to one Divine center , so that unified and conjoined in harmony, they may form an universal temple wherein all souls may worship p. 304 and serve the one true God, the Almighty Father, th e great All,74b and within all who then shall reign forever and ever and to his Kingdom there shall be no end. Next: Chapter LXVII. The Idolatry Of The Postdiluvi ans THE IDOLATRY OF THE POSTDILUVIANS. It is written, \"And the earth was of one language a nd had the same words\" (Gen. XI. 1) and it is furth er added \"And as they, these words, went from the east\" (miqqedem ). This word here signifies he who is the Alpha or Premier of the world. It is also said, \"They found a plain or valley in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. \" As soon as they separated themselves from this premier, unity of th ought and mind amongst them was no longer possible, and they became dispersed and scattered abroad in all parts of the earth. If in opposition to these remarks, an yone should refer to the words of scripture 'And a river went out of Eden to water the Garden and from thence it was div ided and became into four heads,' (Gen. II. 10) in order to show that even in association and close proximity w ith the Divine Presence, divine separation occur and therefore it was nothing extraordinary that this deflection and revolt from the Premier of the world should take place, just as it was with the river of Eden that it should become pa rted into four heads. In reply we admit that it was not impossible it should do so after but not before its exit from the garden, so with respect to mankind after the deluge, so long a s they remained united together they were attached to the worship of God, the premier of the world. They had one in c ommon, one language, one faith, one mode of worship ping the Divine Being, binding them together in an universal Brotherhood that prevailed amongst them. But decli ning in divine knowledge and reverence, they gradually veer ed away from allegiance to their great Premier (miq qedem) until at length they found a plain in the land of S hinar, or in other words, they became ignorant of G od their creator"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"and devoid of all knowledge of the higher and divin er life. Scripture relates of Nimrod, 'The beginnin g of his Kingdom was Babel' from which we gather, it was he who first seduced the postdiluvians from the worshi p and service of the true god, and introducing confusion and disunion amongst them, he eventually succeeded in usurping rule and sovereignty over them and led them to a pl ain in the land of Shinar, by which is meant, that from that time men forsook the worship of the Divine and began p. 305 to live in defiance of his law, then degenerated an d gave themselves74a-74b wholly up to the pursuit o f and indulged in worldly pleasures and enjoyments, worsh ipping the creature rather than their creator who i s blessed forever. It is further related, 'And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose head m ay reach into heaven and let us make us a name (shem)' (Gen. XI. 4). Next: Chapter LXVIII. The Tower of Babel \"THE TOWER OF BABEL.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: It is written, 'The wicked are lik e the troubled sea' (nigrash) (Is. LVII. 20). Is th ere then a troubled sea? Truly so, for when it exceedeth its boundaries , it becomes 'nigrash' and bursting its barriers, a s a man intoxicated with wine, rolling and staggering and u nable to keep himself erect, and scripture further adds, of the sea when in this troubled state, 'It cannot rest; and i ts waters cast up mire and dirt,' meaning that whil st it is calm, the mud concealed in its depths remains undisturbed but the moment its surface begins to be ruffled and ag itated by tempestuous winds and storms it is ejected, similar ly with a man who as long as he is devoted to the s ervice of his Lord, his lower nature or self is calla and peacefu l, its animal propensities repressed and restrained , but as soon as his relation with his divine higher self becomes di sturbed and broken, like a drunkard, he begins to r eel and stagger, and give utterance to the depraved feelings and emo tions that have lain dormant within him, and in pro portion as he babbles forth his obscure and filthy gibberish, so does his profanity increase, for it is the reflecti on of his impure animal self that then becomes manifested. Observe t he words, 'And they said, go to, let us build us a city and tower whose top shall reach into heaven.' The term \" habah \" (go to) whenever used in scripture is always foun d in connection with some thing or project unrealizable by those who conceived it. Their blind impulse to b uild such a city and tower arose only from a wicked and foolish desire that animated and prompted them to live in open revolt against the Holy One.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"They were the subjects of a horri ble and demoniacal infatuation in that they impious ly wished to abandon the worship of their Lord for that of Satan or the serpent to whom they rendered homage and gl ory. The words, 'go to, let us build us a city and tower,' h ave a deeply occult meaning p. 306 and contain a mystery most profound. Remark that wh en the Postdiluvians arrived at the plain in the la nd of Shinar (a strange kingdom or domain) and had become acquai nted with and accommodated themselves to its natura l advantages coming from its proximity to the sea, th ey said amongst themselves, it will be best for us to settle down and dwell here, for with little trouble and at once we can indulge in those sensual pleasures and deli ghts that are the charm of life, making it worth the living. But why worship heavenward and what advantage will accrue t o us in so doing. Here let us build us a temple and make a dei ty of ourselves. Come and let us make a shem (name, a synonym for God, or a Divine Being) whom we can adore and h ave him always in our midst as a center of attracti on, and thus avoid becoming dispersed abroad on the face of the earth.\" Next: Chapter LXIX. A Comparison Between Noah and M oses A COMPARISON BETWEEN NOAH AND MOSES. SAID Rabbi Jehuda: \"Whilst the antediluvians were l iving,67a-67b the Holy One looked down up the heart h and beheld no one able to save them from being destroye d. If it be asked, was there not Noah? the question is of no force, since Noah had not that abundance of persona l merit to save them; it only sufficed to save hims elf and for repeopling the world. Therefore it is written of hi m, 'For thee only have I seen righteous before me i n this generation' (Gen. VII, 1); that is, compared with t he rest of his contemporaries, he was the only one who lived uprightly.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"The words 'in this generation' fa r from diminishing the merits of Noah, rather exalt and increase them. The meaning of scripture is, that they were n ot comparative with respect to others, but intrinsi c and would have made him distinguished had he lived in any oth er age, even if it had been in that of Moses. If No ah with his righteousness was unable to save the world, it was because there were not ten righteous men to be foun d to effect this. We infer this from the request of Abraham, wh ilst ruin was still impending over and threatening the destruction"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"of Sodom and Gomorrah. 'Let not the Lord be angry a nd I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten should be found there; and he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake' (Gen. XVIII, 32). Now in the time of N oah, including himself with his sons and their wives, there were n ot to be found ten such men as he, in that generati on, p. 308 otherwise it would have been spared for their sake and escaped destruction.\" Said Rabbi Eleazor to Rabbi Simeon, his father: \"Tr adition informs us that when the sins and iniquitie s of unrighteous men abound in the world and attain thei r climax, and divine justice is ready to overtake a nd destroy them, the just and upright should plead on their be half, for they alone are able to expiate the guilt of their fellowmen.\" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"We have learned that w hen Noah came forth out of the ark, the Holy One de sired he should repeople the earth. The judgment of the ante diluvians was unable to fall upon and affect him, a s he was concealed in the ark and so escaped the eye of the destroying angel. Observe it is written, 'Seek afte r righteousness, seek after meekness, it may be, ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger' (Zeph. II, 3). This wa s done by Noah, and by entering into the ark he was hid in the day of the Lord's anger and so escaped the power of the accusing angel. This passage of scripture has reference to a great mystery known and understood only by the hig hest initiates and adepts; that is, the thaumaturgic power of the twenty-two letters of the celestial alphabet wielde d by angels in destroying and exterminating the wicked.67b Therefo re it is that scripture states, 'they were destroye d from the earth' (va-imchon). Remark now the difference that disting uished Moses from all other men. At the time the Ho ly One said unto him, 'Now let me alone that my wrath may wax h ot against them and that I may consume them and I w ill make of thee a great nation' (Ex. XXXII, 10). Moses with out a moment's hesitation replied, 'Shall I give up and forsake Israel for my own personal exaltation and advantage ? If so, will not worldly people say that I was a t raitor and sacrificed them because of my ambitious and selfish desire of becoming ruler and chief of a great nati on, like unto Noah who when the Holy One said unto him, 'Behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the eart h to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and everything that is on the earth shall d ie, but with thee will I establish my covenant and thou shalt come in to the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons' wives with thee' (Gen. VI, 17-18). Far from entreating Go d for his fellowmen, not to destroy them, Noah thou ght only of his own safety and that of his own family, and, owi ng to this neglect on his part, the p. 309 waters of the deluge bear his name; for so it is wr itten, 'For I67b have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth' (Is. LIV, 9). But Moses thought thus: If the people of Israel is destroyed, it will be said I acted selfishly in that I refrained from interceding on t heir behalf and allowed them to perish for the sake of personal gratification and ambition to become the head of a great nation. No, it is better for me to die and by my death save Israel from perishing; and so it is written, 'and M oses besought the Lord, his God, and said, Lord, wh y doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people' (Ex. XXXII, 11) . He prayed for mercy and it was granted to him, and thus was Israel saved.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"How could Moses in his entreaty with the Lord on behalf of Israel say, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people? The Israelites had worshipp ed an idol as God, had just informed him and become idolators as other nations, for they had made them a molten c alf and bowed in worship to it and sacrificed unto it and said, 'These be thy gods, oh Israel, which have brought t hee out of the land of Egypt.' Yet after such heino us iniquity and forgetful ingratitude, Moses could say, 'Let not th y wrath wax hot against thy people.' What was his r eason in so doing? In reply we say, whoever takes upon him the office of a mediator and intercessor is bound to ex terminate the delinquency of the offender before the injured one, and magnify it in the sight of the guilty one. Thu s acted Moses who spoke as though the iniquity of the Israelites was of little account, yet did h e not fail to upbraid them severely, and said unto them, 'Ye have sinned a great sin' (E x. XXXII, 30). Yet ceased he not pleading for them, and even offered his own life for their forgiveness and pres ervation, as it is written, 'If thou wilt forgive t heir sins, and if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written. It was after the utterance of this prayer , the Holy One pardoned the Israelites and repented of the evil wh ich he thought to do unto his people. Not so did No ah act, but prayed only for his own salvation and made no effor t to save the world; so that when divine judgment a fflicts it, the cry of the Holy Spirit is heard far unto the world when no Moses is found to intercede for it. But it is written, 'He remembered the days of old, of Moses and his people . Where is he that brought them up out of the sea w ith the shepherd of his flock? Where is he that put his hol y spirit within him' (Is. LXIII, 11). These p. 310 words allude to Moses, especially to his earnest in tercession;67b-68a so that the Lord said, 'Wherefor e criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that the y go forward' (Ex. XIV, 15), and thus they were sav ed at the Red Sea through his prayer, so that they went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters became as a wall unto them on their right and on their left.' I t was also through Moses that the Schekina descende d and made its"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"abode in their midst and, therefore, on account of his constant care and solicitude for their welfare, are they described as 'the people of Moses.'\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Though Noah was a just man, yet was his righteousness not such as to prevail with the Holy One to forgive the sin of the antediluvians. Observ e that Moses never trusted in or made mention of hi s own merit, but of that of the patriarchs, and in this had a gr eat advantage over Noah.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Notwithstanding Noah could not a vail himself of the merits of the patriarchs, he sh ould have prayed for his fellowmen when God said unto him, 'I will establish my covenant with thee,' and the pra yer of thanksgiving he offered after coming out of the ark , he ought to have made before the deluge, and plea ded for the preservation of the world.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"In defence of Noah, how could h e offer sacrifice on behalf of the antediluvians wh en they were continually committing outrageous and heinous offen ses against the Holy One. It is true he saw the awf ul judgment impending over mankind that was about to destroy th em off the earth on account of their exceeding wick edness, and feared lest he himself might be overwhelmed by it.\" Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Always whenever the wicked incre ase in the world, it is the righteous found amongst them who are the first to suffer, as it is written, (and beg in at my sanctuary) (Ez. IX, 6) (mimiqdashe). Now t his word should not be translated and read at my sanctuary, but rat her by those who sanctify me (miniqdashi). But why was it that Noah escaped the impending destruction? Because it was destined, through him, the earth should be repe opled, inasmuch as he alone was found just amongst his fel lowmen. Furthermore his preservation was owing to h is earnest exhortations and continuous preaching to them, notw ithstanding they persistently refused to listen to him or to regard his predictions of coming evil. It p. 311 is therefore to him the words of scripture apply, n evertheless68a if thou warn the righteous man that he sin not and he doth not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned, also thou hast delivered thy soul. (Ez. II I. 21). From which words we may gather that whoever warns sinners, sav es himself even though they give no heed unto him. He has performed his duty, and if they perish, it is owing to their perverse refusal to take advice.\" Next: Chapter LXX. Why the Animal was Destroyed by the Deluge WHY THE ANIMAL WAS DESTROYED BY THE DELUGE: Rabbi Jose, whilst on a visit to Rabbi Simeon, aske d this question: \"What impelled the Holy One to Des troy, along with sinners, the beasts of the field and the fowl of the air? Were they alike responsible for the vas t wickedness of the antediluvians?\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"It was because, as we read, And God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrup t; for all flesh had corrupted his way, upon the earth (Gen. V I. 12); implying that the animal creation also had forsaken its natural habits and desires after its own species re sulting in the production of monstrous and abnormal forms. This was mainly owing to man's corruption and transgress ion against natural laws, and therefore the Holy On e said, Through following and indulging in your lustful inc linations and passions you seek to derange and dest roy the order of nature, I will destroy from off the face of the earth all living creatures and will purify the worl d by water, as at the beginning of creation; and, after that, will repeop le it with a new progeny both of men and animals, b etter than what now exists.' It is written, 'Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.'\" (Gen. VII. 7). Said Rabbi Hiya: \"We read, 'Can anyone hide himself in a secret place, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth (Jer. XXIII. 24). How gre at the number of those who foolishly refrain from m editation on the law and the words of their Lord, imagining they can conceal their sins and wrong doing from his al l-seeing eye, and say unto themselves, who will see and know what we do? Of such it is written, 'Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works a re in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us and who knoweth us?' (Is. XXIX. 15). To them may be applied the followin g parable. A certain king p. 312 built a large palace with subterraneous passages an d chambers.68a-68b Eventually his attendants rebell ed against him. He then ordered his guards to seize and impris on them. In order to escape punishment, the rebels went and hid themselves in the secret underground chambers. On h earing of this, the king said, 'Do they think to hi de from me who planned and built the palace and therefore am f ully acquainted with all its secret hiding places?' To those who seek to hide their sins and misdeeds, God says, 'It is I who have built the secret places; it is I who concealed light and darkness, and you imagine you can hide from me. ' Observe when anyone commits sins secretly, the di vine law of karma will cause them to become revealed and man ifested to the world. But if he repents and desires to atone for them, the Holy One hides him in a manner that the a venging and destroying angle is unable to behold an d afflict"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"him. Therefore it is the opinion of Rabbi Simeon th at one who has the evil eye, that is, who is natura lly envious and jealous in disposition, is biased by the spirit of evil, and, in the sphere wherein he moves, becomes himself a power of evil to others and should be avoided, in order t o escape injury from him. For the sake of self-pres ervation it therefore behoves everyone to shun by the exercise of caution the deadly glances of the destroying ang el. Speaking of Balaam, the scripture states, 'And Balaam the so n of Beor hath said, and the man whose eye was clos ed hath said' (Num. XXIV. 3). Now Balaam possessed the evil eye a nd whenever he directed on anyone his looks, on him the destroying angel alighted. And knowing this, he tur ned his gaze upon Israel in order to afflict and de stroy them. But note what is said. 'And Balaam lifted up his eyes.' It is not written eyes, but 'his eye,' and he behe ld Israel abiding in their tents according to their tribes.' As he looke d, he detected the presence of the Schekina in thei r midst, overshadowing and protecting them, so that the glan ce of his evil eye proved powerless and ineffectual to afflict and injure them. Then he exclaimed, 'How can I prevail against them, seeing that the Holy Spirit their pro tector is watching over and guarding them against all evil, f or he coucheth and lays down as a lion and as a gre at lion, who shall stir him up?' (Num. XXIV. 9) or, in other wor ds, who shall cause the Shekina to depart from the midst of Israel so that I may attack them with the power of my evil eye? It was in a similar manner the Holy One wishe d to protect Noah and hide him from p. 313 the power of the destroying angel's evil glances to afflict him, and so commanded him to enter and con ceal himself within the ark and thus escape from the onrushing w aters of the deluge.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Noah saw the angel of death appro aching and therefore went into the ark in which he was concealed for a period of twelve months, respecting which there is a difference of opinion between Rab bi Isaac and Rabbi Jehuda, one affirming that this term is the f ixed duration of the punishment of the wicked, the other that it was necessary for68b Noah to pass through the twelve de grees or stages of righteousness ere he could becom e a just and perfect man.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"The punishment of the wicked en dures six months by water and six months by fire. T he punishment of the antediluvians was by water, why t herefore did it endure twelve months?\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"The punishment of the guilty in G ehenna is effected both by water and fire; that is to say, first by the descent upon them of waters cold as ice, for a period of six months, and of boiling waters for a l ike period and that rise from below, and is the chastisement by fi re, as has been handed down by tradition. It was th erefore essential that Noah should remain in the ark for twelve month s to avoid the glances of the death angel who was t hen unable to afflict him when it floated upon the face of the wa ters, as scripture states, 'And it was lifted up ab ove the earth.' Woe unto evil doers who will never rise again and appea r at the day of judgment. They become blotted out o f existence, as it is written, 'Thou hast blotted out their name s forever'; (Ps. IX. 6) words spoken of those who p erish everlastingly in the primordial fire. 'And the wate rs bare up the ark and it was lift up above the ear th.'\" (Gen. VII. 17). The actual punishment lasted only forty days u pon the earth, as scripture states, 'And the flood was forty days upon the earth,' the remainder of the year serving for the complete effacement of the antediluvians fr om off the face of the earth. Said Rabbi Abba: It is written, 'Be thou exalted, o h God, above the heavens, and let thy glory be abov e all the earth' (Ps. LVII. 11). Woe unto the wicked and unrighteous who daily insult their Lord and by their misdeeds repulse the schekina from them and cause it to forsake and depa rt from the world. In this verse the Schekina is ca lled Alhim. Observe the words p. 314 of scripture, 'And the waters bare up the ark'; tha t is to say,68b-69a the deeds of sinful men repel t he Schekina, of whom the ark is a symbol. When this happens, the ea rth is left without a defender and protector agains t impending judgments and affliction that assail it from all si des. Only after they have run their course and the wicked have been destroyed, does it return again into this lower wor ld.\" Here Rabbi Jose asked the question: \"If this be so, why has not the Schekina returned again to the lan d of Israel after the dispersion of faithless and sinful Jews? Rabbi Abba replied: \"Because there are found in it no longer any just and righteous men. Wherever the just are, there is the Schekina abiding and dwelling amongst them, even though they leave their native land and emigrate to a foreign country. Of all the sins that tend to drive the Schekina from the world, self-defilement is th e most heinous, as was already remarked, and he who is guilty of it wi ll never behold the face of the Schekina, and never ascend into the heavenly palace, but will become as scripture s tates, 'destroyed from the face of the earth,' and that completely, so the Holy One shall raise the dead.

It will be to it, what leaven is to b read and by it the Holy One will reconstitute the w hole body, but only those who are raised again out of the Holy land, as it is written, 'Prophesy and say unto them, thus s aith the Lord God, behold oh my people, I will open your graves a nd cause you to come up out of your graves and brin g you into the land of Israel' (Ez.

At the time o f the resurrection their bodies reformed and renewe d will revolve under the earth and appear in the Holy Land in orde r that they may be incarnated again by their souls, scripture states, \"And I will put my spirit in you and ye sha ll live and I shall place you in your own land.\" Th us will all bodies be reanimated by their souls, excepting those who h ave defiled themselves and corrupted the earth by t he sin of self- pollution, for of them is written as of the antedil uvians, 'They p. 315 were destroyed from off the face of the earth.' Tho ugh amongst the doctors and sages of ancient times there have been great disputes and differences of opinion resp ecting the exact meaning of the word va-imahou (and they were destroyed or effaced from), yet by its use, it is c ertain that scripture teaches such sinners shall ne ver rise again, the elements composing their lower selves being dissolv ed 69a and consumed in the primal fire out of which they were first evolved, equivalent to being effaced and blot ted out of the book of life.\"Ps. 69:28 Rabbi Simeon, in replying to these observations of Rabbi Abba, said: \"It is certain that the antediluv ians will have no part in the life to come, as it is written of th em, 'they were destroyed from the earth'; this word here signifying the future life, as in the words 'they shall inherit th e earth forever' (Is. LX. 21). And even if they do appear at the judgment day, it is written of them, 'and many of t hose that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awa ke, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame and punishment' (Dan. XII. 2). The difference of opinio n that exists arises from the question whether or not the unjust will ever rise again in the judgment day.

And Every Living Substance Was Destroyed. . . \"AND EVERY LIVING SUBSTANCE WAS DESTROYED WHICH WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE GROUND.\" GEN. VII. 23. Said Rabbi Abba: \"The word 'ath' preceding 'col hay qoun' (every living substance) includes in the delu ge also the celestial chiefs and rulers under whose jurisdictio n the earth was placed at that time, for when the H oly One punishes mankind he first chastises their spiritual rulers and then those over whom they ruled, as it is written, 'In that day shall the Lord punish the host of the high ones that are on high, the kings of the earth upon the earth' (Is. XXIV. 21). But how can these angel chiefs be destroyed? A re they consumed in the primordial fire, as is writ ten, 'For the Lord they God is a consuming fire and by that eleme nt, angel rulers are destroyed as those under their rule were destroyed by water, and thus it was that every livi ng substance upon the ground was exterminated there from; that is, the cattle and creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, all were destro yed from the earth and Noah only remained along with those in the ark.\" p. 316 Said Rabbi Jose: \"Even Noah himself did not wholly escape injury, for it has been said that he was cri ppled by the bite of a lion. 'And God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle with him in the ark .'\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"A prudent man forseeth the evil a nd hideth himself' (Prov. XXII. 3). These words ref er to Noah who entered the ark and hid himself therein, seeing the oncoming of the waters and the destroying angel.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"They refer to the man who when de ath rages in the world hideth himself and goes not forth that he may not be seen by the destroying angel who has the n the power of afflicting and destroying whom he be holds, and so in the second part of this verse it is added, 'b ut the simple pass on and are punished.' By the wor d along (abron) scripture teaches that the simple pass along before the exterminating angle and suffer. This word also signifies to transgress, and we are taught the simple break the commands of their lord and consequently are punishe d, My second part of the verse is also applied to the con temporaries of Noah who if he had not hid himself i n the ark would have perished along with them in the waters of the flood, but was saved by his obedience to the divine commands, and therefore it came to pass, as it is written, 'a nd God remembered Noah.'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: Whilst divine judgments operate in the world, the word zacar (remember) is never fo und used in scripture only after punishment and judgments have been accomplished and the world has been broken and the destroying angel reigns rampant, and not until he h as executed his mission, does the world revert to i ts normal state,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"and therefore it is written, 'and God remembered No ah.' The word remember is here applied to Noah as b eing a just and perfect man. It is written, 'Thou rulest the ra ging of the sea, when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them' (Ps. LXXXIX. 9). When the waves of the sea arise mountai ns high and its depths are upheaved, the Holy One u nseen sends forth his word by which the angry billows are assuaged and the fury of the waters is restrained and calmed. Jonah was cast into the tempestuous sea and a fish was prepared to swallow him. How was it he continue d to exist and retain consciousness? It was because the Holy O ne rules and governs the powers of evil that procee d from his left and excite and cause storms and tempests. When however the good powers come forth from his right and, descending p. 317 upon the waters, meet those from the left, then the billows rage as beasts hungering after prey. Then it is that the Holy One stilleth them and causes them to return to their place. Another interpretation of the word 's tillest,' (the- shabhem) giving the literal sense is, 'thou praises t them,' because the tempestuous billows are a mani festation of the desire on the part of the evil forces, to come into contact, and union with the good ones proceeding f rom the right, and hence we infer from this passage of scripture t hat a man is worthy of praise when, desirous of the knowledge of divine mysteries, he engages and addicts himself to the study of them. He is worthy of commendation ev en if, through lack of intellectual and natural abilities, success does not crown his endeavours. Said Rabbi Jehuda, whilst in the ark, Noah became a pprehensive lest the Holy One had forgotten him, bu t after the judgment on the antediluvians was completed and the y had been swept off the face of the earth, then is it written, 'And God remembered Noah.'\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"Observe, when the world was un dergoing punishment, it was better for man that his name should not be mentioned before the presence of the Holy One on high, as then his sins and misdeeds wou ld have been remembered and given rise to examination into them. What grou nd have we for making such a statement? From the case of the Shunamite woman. It was on New Year's day, when God sits and judges the world, th at Elisha was staying in her69b house. And he said unto her w ishest thou that I should speak unto the king for t hee, that is, the Holy One who called a King, the King of righteousne ss, the Holy King.2 Kings 4:13 And she said, I dwel l amongst mine own people; meaning, I wish not to be remember ed or spoken of to the Holy One save as one and alo ng with those with whom I live, so that our deeds and acts may not be judged and examined separately but colle ctively together. This she said because when the actions of a whole people are adjudicated upon, those of an i ndividual are less remarked and manifest and therefore avoid cens ure and disapprobation. Observe, that whilst judgme nt was being executed on the world, there was no remembran ce of Noah. When however it was accomplished, then the Lord remembered him. Another interpretation of thes e words is, they have one and the same meaning as t he words 'I have remembered my covenant'\" (Ex. VI. 5). Next: Chapter LXXIII. What Two Rabbis Learned From a Youth \"WHAT TWO RABBIS LEARNED FROM A YOUTH.\" SAID Rabbi Hezekiah to Rabbi Jose, whom he met when 69b travelling from Cappadocia to Hyda and who had expressed surprise at his journeying alone and with out any companion with whom to converse, contrary t o the usual custom: \"I am accompanied by a youth whom I expect to join me presently.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"I am still more astonished to fin d you travelling with a youth who must be wholly un able to converse with you on matters relating to the secret doctrine. To do so, as you are aware is not discre et nor prudent.\" \"What thou sayest is quite true, replied Rabbi Heze kiah.\" At that moment the youth joined them. Said Rabbi Jose: \"Where residest thou, my child?\" He replied, at Hyda . This learned man informed me he was traveling thi ther and it afforded me great pleasure to accompany him thither. Then Rabbi Jose asked the question: Hast thou any k nowledge of the secret doctrine and its teachings?\" \"What I know, replied the youth, I have learned fro m my father, who taught me the meaning of sacrifice s, and I have often listened attentively to lessons he gave to my brother.\" Then said Rabbi Jose: \"Impart to us what thou hast heard and the knowledge thou hast acquired.\" The youth spoke and said: \"It is written, 'and Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and took of every cl ean beast and of every clean fowl and offered them a burnt offering on the altar (Gen. VIII. 20). The altar here mentio ned was that on which Adam himself had formerly sacrificed. But why offered he a burnt offering instead of a sacrifice ? Because it is p. 319 that a burnt offering is offered only as expiation of sins committed in thought. This was the case wit h Noah, for he had said within himself, the Holy One having execut ed judgment on the world and exterminated all manki nd, saving"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"myself, from off the earth, I fear he has forgotten me, so that I shall perish with no hope of reward in the world to come. In imagining this, Noah sinned and therefore in expiation, as soon as he came forth out of the a rk, he built an altar and offered a burnt offering unto the Lord. W hy did he build it when that whereon Adam had sacri ficed yet existed? The reply is that by the action of the del uge everything had been destroyed or overthrown, it was necessary for Noah to rerear it again. It is stated he offere d burnt offerings (oloth), which word though in the singular70a is pronounced in the plural; the mystical reason of wh ich is this. It is written, 'The burnt offering or sacrifice is a woman, a female (asheh), a sweet savour unto the Lo rd' (Lev. I. 17). Now an animal offered as a burnt offering must always be a male, as it is written, 'Let him offer male without blemish' (Lev. I. 17), and also, 'He s hall bring a male without blemish.' Wherefore does scripture state, t he burnt offering is a female (asheh) which literal ly designates offerings to be consumed by fire which if this was the true meaning, the word should have been written ash without the final H. The fact is, a burnt offering has for its object the union of the male with the female pr inciple, between which there should never be any separation, and tho ugh the word asheh is translated 'consumed' yet, ac cording to tradition, it has a mystical meaning not generally known. It was necessary for Noah to offer up a burn t offering as he represented the male principle which the Holy One j oined and united with the ark, a symbol of the fema le. The offering Noah made was therefore a symbol of this u nion of these two principles, and this is the reaso n why the burnt offering (olah) is called asheh (female). Scr ipture further states, 'And the Lord smelled a swee t savour ,' and Asheh is also called so. Respecting this 'asheh' we have been taught that the smoke and flame are so u nited and conjoined that the one is never without the other; as it is written, 'and Mount Sinai was altogether o n a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire' (Ex. XI X. 18). Observe that fire, being an element of rare subtlety, is in itself invisible like heat to the naked eye and con tinues so until, its vibrations becoming increased and intensified, it comes forth from the body or substance in which it lies p. 320 concealed and then manifests itself. When this occu rs, its existence is only detected and recognized b y smoke proceeding from the body in which it lies latent, a s breath exhaled from the nostrils is indicative of the fire latent in the body; and so scripture states, 'They shall put incense in thy nostrils' (Deuter XXXIII. 10), becau se fire returns to its place of origin and the nostrils sensing its od our give rise to thoughts, feelings and70a desires, becoming, as it is written, 'A sweet savour, 'nihoah,' a something tha t allays wrath, calms anger and restores peace; and when the fire and smoke are unified, joy becomes universal, the f ire appears with greater brilliancy , and God smells a 'sweet savour' as though he breathed in and absorbed all i nto himself. As the youth ceased speaking, Rabbi Jose embraced h im and said: \"What a treasury of knowledge thou pos sessest, and we knew it not. We will return and go with you further.\" And so they journeyed together. Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"May the Schekina go with us, for we have enjoyed the privilege of acquiring know ledge of mysteries, of which we were wholly ignorant.\" Takin g then the youth by the hand they entreated him to recite verses and texts of scripture, the interpretation of which he had learned from his father. Yielding to their request the youth said: \"It is wr itten, 'He shall kiss me with the kisses of his mou th' (Cant. I. 2). These words refer to the heavenly desire that comet h not from the fire of the nostrils but from the mo uth, for when the lips meet and touch, love is engendered and fel t as a fire enlightening the face, whilst the eyes become suffused with joy and delight; and, therefore, it is further added, 'for thy love is better than wine,' meaning the wine which makes the heart pulsate with joy and the features g low with delight and the eyes of those who drink th ereof to glisten with rapture, altogether different from the intoxic ant that excites quarrels, sours the visage, making it appear dull and heavy. The wine spoken of in this verse is good . It brightens the countenance, brings a mystic lig ht into the eves, excites love and desire and fills the hearts of all who drink it with feelings of inexpressible joy an d ecstasy and is symbolized by the libations of the words, 'thy love is better than wine.' For, according to the aphori sm, 'As above, so below,' there is a joint conformity between the two worlds, when desire is excited in the one, so is p. 321 it in the other. They may be compared to two lighte d candles, when that above is extinguished, the fla me of that below mounting up in the smoke of the burnt offerin g enkindles it again.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"It is truly so, for the two w orlds are blended and dependent the one on the othe r, and it was owing to the disharmony between them when the templ e at Jerusalem was destroyed that blessings from he aven have not descended and prevailed throughout the wor ld.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"Because the source of all blessin gs is dried up, maledictions and afflictions are so widely rampant and Israel no longer dwells on the earth dischargin g duties necessary to keep the candles burning and so obtain and enjoy those heavenly benedictions, from the lack of which the earth no longer exists in her primal and normal state of peace and happiness.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"It is written, 'And the Lord7 0b said in his heart, I will not again curse the gr ound any more for man's sake' (Gen. VIII. 21). What do these word s mean?\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Jose: \"I have heard Rabbi Simeon say, 'W hen fire from heaven is intense and comes into cont act with matter, it produces a thick smoke that is exceeding ly harmful to the world; and the more its heat fall s on mankind the more injurious it is to them, on account of the smoke sent forth by which they are suffocated and destroyed. But, when it is moderate and not in excess, it is no lon ger a destructive agent.' The meaning of the words to asiph (will not again) is, 'I will not augment the heat that I send unto the world below and which on coming into contact with the matter of the earth gives rise to smoke that is deleterious and destructive to life.'\" The youth again spoke and said: \"I have heard that when God said unto Adam, 'Cursed is the ground for thy sake,' the evil spirit then obtained power to rule over th e earth and also to destroy and afflict mankind dwe lling thereon. But from the day that Noah offered a burnt offering and the Holy One smelled 'a sweet savour,' the ear th became endowed with the power of freeing itself from the y oke of the serpent and of purifying itself from the infection with which it was tainted; and for this reason it is tha t Israelites offer burnt offerings to the Holy One, in order to enlighten the face of the earth.\" p. 322 Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"That is true, but the earth d id not become wholly purified until the Israelites arrived and stood at the foot of Mount Sinai.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"The Holy One diminished the light of the moon and gave the serpent power to rule ove r the earth because of the sin of Adam, through which all creat ures on it became cursed and remained so, up to the sacrifice offered by Noah. The moon, however, still retains i ts horned limbs, except when sacrifices were offere d up, and Israel became an inhabitant of the earth.\" Said Rabbi Jose to the youth: \"What is your name?\" He replied: \"Abba (father).\" \"May you,\" said Rabbi Jose, \"become a father in eve rything--in wisdom as in years--and may it be said of thee, 'Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that b are thee shall rejoice'\" (Prov.

XXX. 26) . That is, as the light which the Holy One hid at t he conclusion of the seven days of creation for the enjoyment of the righteous.\" \" And God blessed Noah and his sons and said, be frui tful and multiply and replenish the earth .\"Gen 9:1 Next: Chapter LXXIV. p. 323 SAID Rabbi Abba: \"'The blessing of the Lord maketh7 0a-71b rich' (Prov. X. 22). The blessing of the Lor d is the Schekina who rules over the blessings that come to mankind, To the words of this verse in scripture is added, 'And he added no sorrow with it.' Now the term atzeb (so rrow) is here used because it alludes to the myster y expressed in the words, 'cursed be the ground for thy sake, in s orrow (beitzabon) shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.' The utzeb here designates that sense of the divine wrat h and displeasure that causes the face of man to lo se all traits of joy and to become pallid with fear and alarm. In ad dressing these words to Adam God wished to say that henceforth man would not partake of spiritual food and nourish ment freed from and unsurrounded by evil spirits, w hose object would be to prevent his reception of heavenly and d ivine benedictions pure and unalloyed with sorrow a nd regret. This is why scripture states that he, the Divine Be ing, will not add (yosiph) sorrow (atzeb) with his blessings, thus expressing the same mystery as in the words, 'I wil l not again (aseph) curse the ground for man's sake .' Scripture further states, 'And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the earth and u pon all the fishes of the sea,' meaning, 'From this day henceforth you shall be endowed with a human form, of which ma n by his wickedness had become divided.' After Adam 's transgression, the human countenance became so chan ged that it lost all resemblance of Alhim in whose image he had been p. 324 created, so that man, instead of inspiring animals with fear of him, lived in fear of them. As they ga zed upon him before his fall, they recognized the marks of his d ivine origin and stood in awe before him, but, afte r the loss of his innocency, they regarded him only as a creature lik e unto themselves. Observe that all men living the higher and divine life and observing obediently the commandmen ts of their Lord, exhibit in their countenances the imprint of the divine, before which all creatures on beholding it tremble and fear. But immediately that men begi n to transgress the good law it fades and becomes obscured, that an imals are no longer restrained through fear of atta cking them."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The world after the deluge became renewed and purif ied, and God in blessing men restored to them the l ost power of ruling over the animal creation and over the fis h of the sea, as it is written, 'And upon all the f ishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered' (Gen.

Comparison Between Adam and the Postdiluvians COMPARISON BETWEEN ADAM AND THE POSTDILUVIANS. It is written, \"And the Lord came down to see71a, 7 5a the city and the tower which the children of men builded\" (Gen. XI. 8). This is one of the ten manifestations and descents of the Schekina in the world. If it b e asked what need was there for descending on this occasion, seeing t hat the erection of the city must have been well kn own on high? we reply, it was to pass and execute judgment upon the presumption of these Postdiluvians. The word \"l iroth\" (to see) is sometimes taken in this sense as in the wor ds, \"The Lord look upon you and judge\" (Ex. V. 20). The esoteric meaning of the words \"to see the city and the tower \" is this. It was not with the object of seeing them but the men who were engaged in their erection. When the Holy O ne is about to execute judgments upon men for their evil deeds, he begins with those who are first and forem ost in wrongdoing, p. 325 and afterwards, turns attention to their ignorant a nd misguided75a-75b followers. But why are these bu ilders of Babel here mentioned and referred to not as men, bu t as the children of Adam? It was because they acte d similarly to our first ancestor who revolted against his Lord and caused death to enter into the world. Even so did they denounce allegiance to the rule of the Lord and by their audacious and presumptuous project thought to scale the heights and invade the domain of heaven itself. Next: Chapter LXXVI. Rabbi Simeon on the Closing of the Sanctuary RABBI SIMEON ON THE CLOSING OF THE SANCTUARY. Said Rabbi Simeon: \"We read, thus saith the Lord Go d. The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east, (quadim), shall be shut the six working days, but o n the Sabbath, it shall be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened' (Ez. XLVI. 1.). These words hav e a hidden meaning which should be made known, in o rder to comprehend and better understand the true significa tion of what has formed the subject of our discussi on. In the first place, let us inquire why it was enjoined that the sanctuary should be closed during the six working d ays and opened only the Sabbath and the first of the month? It was in order to guard against the entry of the profane , so that they might not abuse what was sacred and holy, and there fore the gate of the sanctuary was opened only on t he Sabbath and the day of the new moon when its light became b lended with that of the sun. Observe that during th e six working days, the lower world seeks to obtain and d raw nourishment from the higher world. It is also d uring these days that the accuser or spirit of evil, save in th e land of Israel, is rampant in the world. At the t ime of the sabbath and new moon, he is compelled to withdraw his prese nce and recede into his own dark realm as long as t he gate of the sanctuary remains open. Then is it the world re joices on being freed from the power and influence of the evil one. If it be asked: Is he the only one that rules and operates during the week days? we reply, that b efore the elementals begin their work in the world, the Holy One beholds and looks down upon it, but only during the sabbath and the time of new moon does he provide for its su stenance that comes through the sanctuary, all of w hose gates are then opened and peace prevails in both worlds. Remark that it p. 326 is said, 'and the Lord came down to see (liroth) th e city. . . .'75b that is, divesting himself of a p art of his glory, he manifested himself in a visible form in order that, after viewing the city and tower they were buildin g, he might confound their audacious plans and disperse them th roughout the world.\" Next: Chapter LXXVII. The Object of Building the To wer of Babel "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE OBJECT OF BUILDING THE TOWER OF BABEL. Whilst sitting one day in the presence of Rabbi Sim eon, this question was asked by Rabbi Isaac: \"What impelled these Postdiluvians to be so foolish as to revolt a gainst the Holy One, and how did they become actuat ed with the idea of building a tower whose top should reach unt o heaven?\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"We learn from tradition that by the words, 'and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east' (miquidem) scripture informs us that they quitted t he highlands for the plains, the land of Israel, in order to fix their habitation in Babel. 'Here,' said they, 'we can liv e and dwell, come let us make to ourselves a name, or in other words, let us worship and adore the god of this wor ld, and by so doing acquire and enjoy his favor and help; so that when catastrophes and calamities occur, we shall have here a sure re fuge and means of escape from their baneful and destructive effects. Here is abundance of food, and we may reap plentiful harvests which in the pa st have cost us so great toil and labor. Nay, more, let us make a t ower reaching up to heaven, so that we may mount an d wage war in the domain of the Premier himself, and thus prev ent him from again overwhelming and destroying mank ind with a deluge, as in the past.' It is written, 'And the Lord said the people is one and they have all one l anguage and this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restraine d from them which they have imagined to do' (Gen. X I. 6). The meaning of which words this is. In the celestial wo rld when all its spheres are harmonious, power is t he result. So is it in the world of mankind when all minds become im bued and swayed by unity of thought and feeling. Wh atever enterprise or project is undertaken, it is bound to succeed and be accomplished whether its object be good or evil. To nullify their impious intention and purpose of wagi ng war against it was essential that this unity of design should be broken and their plans be thwarted and, therefore, as stated, 'The Lord scattered these p. 327 builders of Babel and dispersed them abroad upon th e face75b-76a of the earth. And that they might be compelled to cease the building of their city, he confounded the ir language so that they were unable to understand each other's thoughts and respond to them. Before this the holy language was universally spoken. Next: Chapter LXXVIII. The Primeval Language and th e Book of Adam THE PRIMEVAL LANGUAGE AND THE BOOK OF ADAM. \"Its chief characteristic was, it enabled everyone to express himself clearly and unmistakably in term s exactly corresponding to his thoughts, wishes and intention s, otherwise they were not understood and comprehen ded by the heavenly powers. Thus it came to pass that, by conf usion of their speech, their power resulting from u nion of will and purpose was destroyed and nullified. Note that words of the holy language are understood by celest ial beings who, when hearing them are impelled to assist and h elp those who utter them, otherwise they pay no hee d or regard to them. This now occurred to the builders of Babel who, on ceasing to speak the holy tongue, lost pow er and ability to carry out and execute their design and therefore left off building the city. It is written, 'Blesse d be the name of the Lord forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his ' (Dan. II. 20), for they come from and are only wi th God.' Man being naturally too weak and powerless to possess, has corrupted the divine wisdom which the Holy One imparted and made known to the world and also using it for s elfish ends and purposes and presuming on the knowl edge of it, has dared to rebel and revolt against their lord. T his secret hidden wisdom was revealed at first and imparted to Adam who by it became instructed in its secret doct rine respecting the celestial spheres and their gua rding angels. Though endowed with all this profound knowledge, he allowed himself to be influenced and deceived by t he tempter so that the fount of this divine wisdom and treasury of knowledge became closed to him. After his repentance, it was again opened to him, but only pa rtially so. In the book that bears his name, he has transmitted this divine wisdom to his successors who, after acquirin g a knowledge of it, provoked the wrath of the Holy One against them by their abuse of it for selfish purposes. Its mysteries were taught by the Holy One to Noah who at first did the will of God, but p. 328 alas! as scripture records of him, he drank of the wine, that is, of the secret wisdom, and was drunke n and lay uncovered within his tent, a full explanation of wh ich words we have already given. Afterwards it was imparted to Abraham who in the service of the Lord used it with great advantage to himself, but he begat Ishmael, who vexed the Holy One. So also was it with Isaac who begat E sau.76a Jacob married two sisters. To Moses was thi s secret wisdom imparted; and of him it is written, 'Who is faithful in all mine house' (Num. XII. 7), for he m anifested his faithfulness in that he never ceased making it the great study of his life. King Solomon became entrus ted with it; and of him it is written, 'The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, King of Israel,' and also the prophetic visions of a man who had God with him and was thus able to do all th ings. Said Solomon himself, since God is with me an d hath given this wisdom unto me, whatever seemeth good un to me, I can do. But of him scripture relates, 'And the Lord"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"raised up the adversary unto Solomon' (I. Kings XI. 14). Observe, it was owing to their abuse of true wisdom that the builders of Babel foolishly and rashly revolted against the Holy One, and after striving to execut e their evil project became scattered over the face of the earth and lost entirely all knowledge of the mysteries o f the secret wisdom. The time will, however, come, when it will be revealed and made known to the world by the Holy One, and he will then become the sole object of man's worshi p and adoration, as it is written, 'And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye sh all keep my judgments and do them' (Ez. XXXVI. 27); or in other words, I will not impart my wisdom to man as aforetime that so they might avoid falling, but slo wly and gradually they may learn it by meditation, and thus by assimilation walk uprightly and keep my command ments.\" Next: Chapter LXXIX. On Words and the Philosophy of Sound ON WORDS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOUND. Rabbi Jose and Rabbi Hiya whilst going together on a journey began conversing on the secret doctrine. The chief subject of their discourse were the words, \"For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp to d eliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee, therefore shall thy camp be holy that he see no unclean thin g in thee and turn away p. 329 76a from thee\" (Deuter. XXIII. 10).Deut. 23:14 Why is t he word mithalekh (walketh) here used instead of 'm ihalekh'? Said Rabbi Jose: \"These words have the same signifi cation as 'And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking (mithhalekh) in the garden in the cool of the day' (Gen. III. 8). In them is expressed the mystery of the tree of whose fruit Adam ate. 'Mithhalekh' denotes the female and 'mihalekh' the male. It was the same divine Being which marched or walked before the children of Israel whi lst travelling through the wilderness; as it is wri tten, 'And the Lord went before them by day . . .' (Ex. XIII. 21), and is the same divine Schekina that walketh befor e a man when he goeth forth, as scripture states, 'The Just One shall go before him and shall set him in the way of his steps' (Ps. LXXXV. 13) in order to deliver him from all peril a nd from all his enemies. That this may be so, it is essential that a man keep himself pure and his camp holy; by which i s implied bodily purity, as through it, his body, h e is influenced and tempted by the world and the Evil On e. It is further added, 'that there be no unclean t hing (ervath dabar) in thee'; which, literally translated, signi fies foul words and obscene language. By this expre ssion scripture teaches us that not only should we preserve our bodies pure, but also see to it that our words and speech be clean and free from obscenity, which, of all things, is an ab omination to the Holy One. And therefore scripture warns us, 'lest he turn away from thee,' for the Schekina abides no t with a man of unclean lips.\" Ere ceasing to speak, Rabbi Jose said: \"Since we ar e journeying together, let our discourse be on subj ects relative to the secret doctrine so that the Holy Spirit of trut h may be and abide with us.\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"It is written, 'And the Lord said , behold! the people is one and they have all one l anguage, and this they begin to do--and now nothing will be rest rained from them which they have imagined to do!' P revious to these words it is said, 'And it came to pass as the y journeyed from the east' (miqqedem); meaning thei r defection from the worship and service of the Premier of the world, 'they found a plain or valley in the land of Shinar.' Wherefore is the term 'found' here used instead of 'they came to'? The esoteric explanation is, they f ound the Book of Hidden Wisdom that had once been in the possessi on of the Antediluvians, p. 330 and by a prolonged study had acquired a thorough kn owledge76b of its many and deep mysteries, so that they became emboldened to rise in revolt against the Hol y One, imagining that by the pronunciation of certa in mystic and occult sounds, words and verses, success would atte nd them and crown their mad enterprise. But note wh at is written, 'The people are one and they have all one language; that is, they were one in mind and though t and spoke one, the holy, language. Perceiving this, the Lord knew well that nothing could hinder or prevent them from realising their object, except by confounding their speech and thus rendering them insensible to the v ibrating tones of mystic words and phrases they had learned from t he Book of Adam. And so they became disunited and s cattered over the face of the earth. Had this not occurred t heir union of will and purpose, together with the k nowledge they had acquired of manipulating the occult forces of n ature, would have empowered them to achieve and acc omplish their bold project, as it is written 'Nothing would have restrained them from doing what they imagined to do'. Had they been obedient and made themselves amenable to the good law, and applied their knowledge for the development of the divine life within them and the subjugation of their lower natures, the history of mankind instead of being a record of moral retrogression and spirit ual declension, would have been a chronicle of prog ress and ascension in the path of light that is now only to be found through suffering and crucifixion of self. The world, instead of being as at present, an Inferno, would l ong ago have become an Elysium. Its children would have become"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"all sons of light, living together in unity, with o ne faith, one hope, one God, the Father of light, t he All and in All, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning or change.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"From the account of these builder s of Babel, we conclude that union is strength, for as long as they were of one heart and mind, not even divine ju stice could have prevented them from accomplishing their purpose, and which was only frustrated because, as it is written, 'And the Lord scattered them upon th e face of the earth.'\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"From this account of Babel and it s builders we also learn something of the great pow er and might of words or speech, that on the external manifestat ions of thought and mind, without which there could have been no p. 331 creation; for, as it is written, 'by the word of th e Lord, the heavens were made.' The science of word s and sounds since the dispersion of mankind is a lost science, but not irretrievably so. In the ages to come it wi ll be recovered, and heaven and earth, men and angels joined in unit y and living in harmony, nations, kindreds and trib es of man now scattered abroad throughout the world, will aga in be one people and have all one language and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cov er the seas. The holy language, lost and forgotten, will be spoken again in all its purity, and the prophecy in script ure become realised. 'For then will I turn to the p eople a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of t he Lord, to serve him with one consent' (Zeph. III. 9) 'And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name76b One' (Zech . XIV. 9). Blessed be the name of the Lord forever and ever.

(Is. X LVI. 12.) By the phrase 'stout-hearted' is meant those hardened soul s who, though acquainted with and having some knowl edge of the secret doctrine, yet manifest no inclination nor de sire to adapt their lives to its teachings and prin ciples and walk in accordance with the precepts of the good law, and a re therefore said to be 'far from righteousness'.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"The meaning of these words is , that they are altogether void of the divine life and so do not enjoy inward peace of conscience, as it is written, 'There is no peace unto the wicked.' (Is. XLV III. 22.) Observe, it was Abraham's desire to live the higher life, and t o him may he justly applied the words, \"Thou hast l oved righteousness and hated wickedness, therefore Alhim , thy Alhim, hath anointed thee with the oil of gla dness above thy fellows.' (Ps. XLI. 8.) For this reason it is f urther written, 'Thou, seed of Abraham, my friend.' (Is. XLI. 8.) Wherefore does the Holy One style Abraham 'my frien ds?' It was because he loved righteousness, for of all who lived in his day and generation he alone was faithf ul, upright and obedient to the divine law.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'How amiable are t hy tabernacles; oh Lord of Hosts.' (Ps. LVIII. 1.)P s. 84:1 How incumbent upon us it is to study the works of the H oly One, for our knowledge of them is only small an d limited.

XII. 1.) \"In t he preceding chapter it is stated that Haran died i n the lifetime of his father Terah, by which words is indicated that up to that time no man had ever died before the dec ease of his parent. When Abraham was cast into a fiery furnace in Chaldea, Haran was present at the time. As the m en of Chaldea beheld the deliverance of Abraham by the Ho ly One, they seized hold of Haran and in their rage cast him into it, in presence of Terah, his father. As it be comes the general opinion that the Divine Being alo ne had saved Abraham, many went unto him and said: \"We see thou art a believer in the Holy One, the ruler of the wo rld, instruct our children in the way.' Therefore it was said, 'T he princes of the people become joined with the God of Abraham.' (Ps. XLVII. 9.) \"Observe the words, 'And Terah took Abraham, his so n, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sar a, his daughter-in-law, his son Abraham's wife, and they w ent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees.' Terah being the leader, it is p. 335 therefore written, 'They went with them and not wit h him.' The fact is that both Terah and Lot went fo rth with Abraham and Sara, who were the chief parties that t he Holy One wished to save and deliver out of the p ower of the wicked Chaldeans. As soon as Terah beheld the wonde rful deliverance of Abraham out of the fiery furnac e, he adopted his faith and became a believer in the one true God, and therefore in saying, 'They went forth with them,' scripture intends to convey that both Terah and Lot became converts to the faith and religion of Abrah am and Sara. So, after going forth from Chaldea, it is added, 't o go into the land of Canaan'; that is to say, that as soon as they had fixed their minds to go to Canaan, it was as though they were really there. From this we may infer tha t from the moment anyone decides to live the life divine, he i s aided and assisted by the powers on high. That th is is so, may be gathered from the fact that it is only after script ure tells us that Abraham and his brethren decided to leave their native country, we learn that the Lord said unto hi m, 'Get thee out of thy country.' Observe nothing i s ever effected above unless there first be an impulse or effort fr om below. The reason of this may be illustrated by the different colored parts of the flame of a candle blending tog ether, as has been already described. It is essenti al that the dark or lower part project itself upward ere the white flam e can appear above it. This is why it is written, ' Keep thou not silent; hold thou not thy peace.' (Ps. LXXXIII. 2.) A prayer unto Alhim not to keep back or strain the white ray of heavenly light from descending upon the earth benea th; and furthermore it is written, 'I have set watc hmen upon thy walls, oh Jerusalem, which, shall never hold their peace, neither day nor night; ye that make m ention of the Lord keep not silence and give him no rest until he esta blish and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the ea rth.' (Is. LXII. 6- 7.) From these words we learn that heavenly gifts a nd blessings descend only when by acts and deeds we qualify ourselves for their reception. Observe that it is d istinctly stated, Terah and all his family quitted Ur of the Chaldees,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"and that then the divine command was given to Abrah am, 'get thee out of thy country,' when he had alre ady done so and was on his77b way to the land of Canaan. How is this invasion of the real facts to be explained?\" p. 336 Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"By the order, 'Get thee out of thy country.' God intimated that it was better for Abraham and to his interest that he should do so, as his future sa fety depended upon his immediate departure from amo ngst his enemies.\" Next: Chapter LXXXII. Abraham's First Studies in Oc cultism \"ABRAHAM'S FIRST STUDIES IN OCCULTISM.\" \"The esoteric meaning of the words, 'Get thee out o f thy country,'78a is this: the Holy One endowed Ab raham with the spirit of wisdom by which he attained to a know ledge of the names and powers of the spiritual chie fs and rulers over the different nations of the world. When, howe ver, he began to study in order to find the localit y of the center of the earth, he soon recognized he was not in poss ession of the knowledge that would enable him to di scover the name of the chief that ruled over it. On further pu rsuing his studies and investigations, he concluded that Palestine was the real center, and, that being so, its chief must be superior to all other celestial powers and potentates. Anxious, therefore, to continue his studies, he at once determined to migrate thither; and therefore i t is stated, 'They went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan.' On arriving in Haran, he set about investigating wherefore Palestine was superior to a ll other parts of the world, but failed to arrive a t any certain and definite conclusion. Entering on a more profound st udy, by means of mathematical calculations and comb inations of the geometrical symbols and signatures of the spiri tual rulers of the various nations in the world, an d also by his science of the courses and influences of the stars and planetary bodies, Abraham at last acquired an e xtensive p. 337 p. 338 knowledge of their grandeur and mystic powers, as a lso of the hierarchies ruling in the universe. All his knowledge and science, however, was unable to enlighten and i nstruct him as to the nature and essence of the Sup reme Being to whom all creatures owe their existence and upon whose care and providence they depend for their food and sustenance. When the Holy One observed his great ye arning and pursuit after divine knowledge, he appea red unto him and said unto him, 'lekh lekha, (get thee out o f thy country), or, in order words, study to know t hyself and look within thyself and cease investigation on the moral influences pervading other lands;--'from thy kindr ed,' cease from thy astrological studies on rules for predicting th e future by the positions of planets in the differe nt constellations of the zodiac and determining the influence resulting from their conjunctions with one another, over the birth and life of human beings. 'From thy father's778a house,'--ch ange the manner of living under which thou hast bee n brought up at home,--renouncing astrological science and he nceforth placing no faith in it. Observe it was aft er departing from Ur of the Chaldees and whilst Abraham was dwel ling in Haran that the divine command was given him to 'get thee out of thy country,' and therefore the exposit ion just given of these words is the only feasible explanation that can be given for their position in the text of holy scripture. It is further added, 'and go to a land I will show thee.' By the word 'arekha' (I will shew thee) is implied tha t Abraham was to cease all his transcendental studi es and investigations on the divine nature and essence, wh ich, being beyond the limits of all human intellige nce must of necessity remain unrecognizable and an insoluble my stery. 'And I will make of thee a great nation and will bless thee and will make thy nation great and thou shalt be a blessing.' There is here a correspondence betw een these four blessings and the four commands given to Abraham th at may be grouped together, thus: 1. 'Lekh lekha,' (I will make of thee a great nation.) 2. 'Get thee out and I wil l bless thee.' 3. 'From out of thy country,'--'and make thy name great.' 4. 'And from thy father's house'--'and thou shalt he a blessing.'\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"These four promises correspond to the four feet or pedestals of the heavenly thron e and as the blessings signified by them were to be enjoyed by A braham, it was indicated to him that all nations sh ould draw their spiritual p. 339 nourishment and sustenance through him. Therefore i t is written, 'I will bless them that bless thee an d curse him that curseth thee, and in thee shall all nations of the earth be blessed'.\" Rabbi Eleazar was one day sitting before Rabbi Sime on, his father, along with Rabbi Jehuda, Rabbi Isaa c and Rabbi Hezekiah. \"Wherefore,\" asked Rabbi Eleazar, \"is it written, ' And God said to Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy count ry' instead of 'get ye out?' in the plural, since all the members of his78a-78b family went out with him at the same time? Though Terah was an idolator, God could have given him a l ike command in case he repented of his idol worship , as we know the Holy One accepts such and regards them wit h favor. That Terah had renounced his early faith i s shown"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"clearly from his going forth with Abraham from Ur o f the Chaldees, when as yet the Lord had not comman ded the Patriarch to do so. Why was, therefore, the order g iven only to Abraham?\" Said Rabbi Simeon in reply: \"If you imagine that it was through renunciation of his former faith Terah left the land of his birth, you are mistaken. It was to escape fr om his fellow-countrymen who sought to kill him. Wh en they observed the miraculous deliverance of Abraham out of the fiery furnace, they said to Terah, 'Thou has deceived us by thy worship of images.' On hearing this, Terah d eparted to Haran, where he lived and died. This is, therefore, why the order was given only to Abraham, and so he departed, as it is written, 'According as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him,' no reference bein g made to Terah because he was already deceased. Fu rthermore, it is written, 'And from the wicked their light is withdrawn and the high arm shall be broken.' (Job X XXVIII. 15.) These words refer to Nimrod, founder of Babel and t he men of his generation, from whom Abraham, who wa s their light, was withdrawn; and so it is not said 'the li ght,' but 'their light' which was with them was wit hdrawn and withholder. 'The high arm' signifies Nimrod himself , who held all his fellows and contemporaries under his tyrannical rule. The command of 'Get thee out of th y country' may, therefore, be paraphrased thus, 'Ge t thee away hence for thine own future safety, that thou and th y family and kinsmen and companions may enjoy the l ight divine.' Furthermore, it is said, 'That now they see p. 340 not the bright light which is in the clouds, but th e wind passeth and they are dispersed.' (Job XXXVII . 21.) What the esoteric meaning of these words is, may be illustra ted from the great event in Abraham's life, namely, his departure from out of his native land in which as long as he continued to live, but he was unable to attain to t he light of the divine or higher life, that from amongst his countr ymen had been withdrawn and continued so, until the wind passed and dissipated the clouds that concealed and hid it , and resulted in Terah and his family eventually r enouncing idolatry and becoming monotheists. That this was wh at occurred may be gathered from the form of expres sion, 'the souls they had gotten in Haran'; that is, who had c hanged their former78b-79a faith, as also from the words of scripture, referring implicitly to Terah, 'And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be bu ried in a good happy old age'.\" (Gen. XV. 18.)Gen. 15:15 Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"We read, 'So Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him.' (Gen. XII. 4.) Ob serve it is not said 'he went forth (ayatza),' but 'he departed (vayelekh); for he had previous to this forsaken h is country and was then dwelling in Haran. It is stated, 'And Lot went with him,' that he might follow Abraham as a g uide, but as the future proved, to little or no effect. Happy ar e they who study assiduously the commandments of th e Holy One, that they may walk in his ways and fear him and the day of judgment, when each one will have to give i n his account of the deeds and acts of his life, as it is written, 'By what a man writes, shall his deeds be known to all.' (Job XXXVII. 7.) The esoteric meaning of which words is, that at the moment of death, when the soul is abou t to leave the body, things previously unseen and uncognized b ecome visible. Ere the separation of the soul from the body takes place, three celestial messengers appear who take account of the number of years each one has li ved, and of all the deeds he has committed in earth life. After its correctness is acknowledged, it is signed and seal ed by his own hand and so, as scripture states, 'By what is writt en and admitted, he shall be judged in the world to come for his misdeeds, whether committed in youth or old age, wh ether recent or in days gone by, all will be made k nown when the account is handed in.' Observe how callous and hardened, wrongdoers become in their nature and cha racter as they pass through earth-life and continue so to p. 341 the end of it. Wherefore truly blessed is he who ha s learned to conform his ways according to the good law and lived in obedience to its dictates and admonitions. How p erverse in their ways! how self-conceited and self- opinionated are evil doers; how unmindful and regardless are th ey of the exemplary lives of good and noble men who spare not themselves to raise and elevate them on to the plan e of a higher life and never cease their efforts, n otwithstanding the many rebuffs and checks they have to endure, fo r well they know and realize that upon themselves l ies the burdensome task to save and rescue humanity from de struction and ruin. If the wicked therefore perish, it is through their own acts and deeds. They reap what they sow, as did Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, and also Lot, who, whilst associated with Abraham, refrained from mingling wi th evil-doers. As soon, however, as he dissociated himself from the patriarch and went on his own way, scriptu re states, 'And Lot chose him all the plain of Jord an' and after visiting and dwelling in various cities, took up hi s residence amongst the inhabitants of Sodom, of wh om it is related, 'the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.' (Gen. XIII. 13.). Said Rabbi Abba, when Rabbi Eleazar had ceased spea king: \"The explanation of the difficulty attending the call of Abraham to leave his native country is quite satisf actory and I agree wholly with the remarks you have made thereon, but how do you explain the words at the en d of the verse, 'And Abraham was seventy and four y ears oldGen. 12:4 reads 'Seventy and five years old' whe n he departed out of Haran.' Did the divine call co me to Abraham whilst sojourning there or whilst living in Ur of the Chaldees?\""},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Eleazar in reply: \"The words of scriptur e you have just quoted refer to Abraham's departure from Haran and not from his native land, which took place many years previous to his receiving the divine command . And Abraham took Sara his wife.' Why is the word 'took' (va yecakh), here used instead of 'led (mashakh)?' Because it is intended to convey that it was by persuasion and no t by compulsion, he induced Sara to go with him; fo r under any circumstance it ill becomes a man to force his wife to emigrate to a foreign land without her free con sent. As in the case of Moses, who 'took' AaronNum. 20:25 Num. 3:45, and also 'took' the Levites, so with Abr aham it is written, 'he took Sara, his wife, and p. 342 [paragraph continues] Lot, his brother's son'; that is, seeing the dange rs threatening them from the perverse manner of the people among whom they were living, he persuade d them so that they willingly consented to go along with him into the land of Canaan. If it be asked what led Ab raham to take Lot along with him? It was because by divine prevision he foresaw that through Lot's descendants King David would be born into the world. It is fur ther related, 'And all the souls that they (Abraham and Sara) had gotten in Haran,' meaning all those whom they had influenced to renounce idolatry and become worshippers of the one and only true God.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"If what you say is true, there mu st then have been a great number of adherents and b elievers who followed and accompanied Abraham and Sara. Was this the case?\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"Certainly it was, and all thos e who went forth with them were called 'the people of the God of Abraham.' It was owing to the great number of them that he was able to pass through the land as stated without any feeling of fear or dread.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"If scripture had said 'And the so uls they had made (asou) in Haran,'79a-79b your rem arks would be quite correct, but the actual words are 'with th e souls (ve-eth hanephesh).' I think the meaning in tended is, that Abraham acquired and was credited with the merits o f those whom he had induced to change their faith w hen in Haran, for whoever leads erring ones into the path of truth, to him is attributed, and rightly so, the merits of all those whom he has succeeded in converting from the error of their ways; and this was the case with Abraham.\" Next: Chapter LXXXIII. Abraham's Initiation into th e Lesser Mysteries p. 343 ABRAHAM'S INITIATION INTO THE LESSER MYSTERIES SAID Rabbi Simeon: Wherefore on first revealing him self79b to Abraham did the Holy One say unto him, ' Lekh lekha, (Get thee out) when as yet he had not spoken a word to him? It was that by the numerical value of the letters of these words he might indicate that when he was a hundred years old 1 , a son should be born unto him. Observe: everything the Holy One does on earth, is wrought b y a mysterious wisdom and beyond all human comprehe nsion. Abraham at the time of his call was far from being perfect in his relationship to the Holy One, and kn owledge of divine science; and, in these words first spoken un to him, allusion is made to the true path and manne r of spiritual ascension by which the soul of man is able to becom e harmonized and assimilated with the Divine Being, and this Abraham could not attain unto previous to his entry into the land of Canaan. King David experienced the same difficulty ere he c ould become qualified to rule. In connection with h im it is written, 'And it came to pass after this, that Davi d enquired of the Lord, saying, 'Shall I go up to a ny of the cities of Judah?' And the Lord said unto him, 'Go up,'2 Sam. 2:1 and David said 'Whither shall I go up?' And He said, 'unto Hebron.' As soon as Saul was dead, the kingdom beca me David's by right, p. 344 why, therefore, was he not at once invested with so vereignty over Israel? By understanding the occult signification of the words of scripture just quoted, the reason w hy may be discerned. David could not merit and qual ify himself for the assumption of royalty and pre-eminence unti l he had attained to the same degree of spiritual l ife and esoteric science as that of the patriarch Abraham, who lay b uried in Hebron. Only by the merit of perfection (t elera in the mysteries) could he become invested with kingly aut hority. To attain unto this, he was obliged to live and abide seven years in Hebron in order to qualify himself f or the sovereignty over Israel, similar to Abraham, who was unable to come into direct covenant with the Holy O ne until he had entered into the land of Canaan. 79 b \"Note now what is written, 'And Abraham passedGen 1 2:6 through the land (va-yaaabor)' rather than he m arched or journeyed, indicating the mystery of the Holy Name, the Shemhamphorash of seventy-two letters, the alm ost infinite combinations of which form the signatures impressed upon every living created being and thing. It is a lso the synthesis of all other divine names. The same word (yaabor) is used when it is stated, 'And the Lord p assed before him (Moses) and proclaimed, 'The Lord, the Lord God be merciful and zealous, long suffering and abunda nt in goodness and truth.' (Ex. XXXIV. 6), in which verse is contained the Divine Name implicitly and the se venty-two letters of which it is composed. In the book of Rab bi Yessa, the Aged, it is stated that the word (va yaabor) in the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"verse, 'And Abraham passed through the land' is als o in the words, 'And I will make all my goodness pa ss (aaber) before thee' (Ex. XXXIII. 19), and is intended to c onvey that the holiness of Palestine proceeds and o riginates from on high. Concerning Abraham's journey to Canaan it is further added, 'unto the place of Sichem,Sichem = Shechem unto the plain of Moreh;' that is, from the impure to the pure part of the Holy Land. 'And the Canaani te was yet in the land.' These words confirm what has already bee n stated, and refer to the evil spirit which after being cursed, brought maledictions into the world, as it is writt en, 'Cursed be Canaan,Gen 9:25 a servant of servant s shall he be unto his brethren.' 'Cursed art thou above all catt le and above every beast of the field.' It was whilst the world was under the rule of the w icked p. 345 one and had become depraved, that Abraham beginning to live the higher life, God, as we read, appeared unto him as He had never before revealed himself to any huma n being, as the one supreme power and sovereign of the world. On learning this great truth, until then unknown, A braham, as scripture states, 'builded an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him,' for the first time causing him to feel assured that the one true God and Lord of t he universe had manifested and made known his existence unto him. ' And he removed79b-80a from thence unto a mountain ( ha- harah)' or the mountain of the 'He,' where were fou nd all kinds of plants, or in more explicit terms, where existed a community or sodality composed of various classes a nd grades of neophytes (sometimes called plants or little ones). 'And he pitched his tent (oholoh),' having Bethel o n the west and Hai on the east. The word 'oholoh (t ent)' is here spelled with a superfluous H, by which is meant Kab allistically that entering on a course of initiatio n into the mysteries of the higher life, he pitched his tent o n the sacred mount of the 'He' and lived there in a ccordance with the occult teachings imparted unto him. As soon as he k new that the Holy One was ruler of the world, he bu ilt an altar. In fact, he built two, the first when the Lord reve aled himself unto him, the other when he had attain ed the science of the 'Hidden Wisdom' and having passed through the v arious grades, became a full initiate. This we gath er from the esoteric meaning of the words, 'And Abraham journey ed, going on still towards the south,' until he rea ched adeptship, symbolically described as the Holy Land, after taking the solemn oath and obligation of sil ence and obedience. After this, scripture states, 'there was a famine in the land'; that is, 'through laxity of life and non- observance of the good law, a decline in moral and spiritual life occurred to such an extent that it i s further stated, 'for the famine was grievous in the land.'

Abraham's Descent into Egypt for Initiation into the Higher Mysteries \"ABRAHAM'S DESCENT INTO EGYPT FOR INITIATION INTO T HE HIGHER MYSTERIES.\" \"On observing this general depravation of manners a nd modes of living, it is written, 'And Abraham wen t down into Egypt to sojourn there.' Here the question may aris e, what was the reason and object of his going down into Egypt? It p. 346 was because at that time Egypt was a great center o f learning, of Theosophy and the science of the Div ine Mysteries, and therefore referred to in scripture as 'the gard en of the Lord like the land of Egypt.' In it, as i n the garden of Eden, of which it is stated, 81b 'From the right of it we nt forth a river called Pison that encompassed the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold,'Gen. 2:11 flowed a gr eat mystical river of divine knowledge, very precio us and unobtainable elsewhere. Abraham having entered into the garden of Eden and become an adept in the secr et doctrine, desirous of passing through all its grade s on two the higher mysteries in order to become 't eloios' or perfect, went down into Egypt where there was gold, or the Hidden Wisdom.\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"It is written, 'And it came to pass that when he was come near to enter into Egyp t.' Why is the word 'higrib (come near)' found here instead of 'ca rab' the Hiphil and not the Kal form of expression. The explanation is, that as the same word 'hicrib' is u sed when the Israelites were before the Red Sea, it is said, 'And Pharaoh drew near' (Ex. XIV. 10), and so were excit ed to fuller dependence on God for deliverance, so was it with Abraham on his nearing Egypt, where he was soon to come into contact and intercourse with men whose ba d actions arising from their ignorance of the worship of the true God; it made him feel a greater need of the di vine life and power to preserve him from the evils of idolatry th en prevailing there.\" "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Next: Chapter LXXXV. p. 346 SAID Rabbi Jehuda: \"Observe that as Abraham went do wn into Egypt without the divine permission, he cau sed his descendants to suffer four hundred years of bondage . He should first have obtained this and all would have gone well. From the first night of his entrance into Egy pt, he had to suffer on account of SaraSara = Sarah , his wife, as it is stated, 'And he said unto Sarah his wife, behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon .' Did he not before know this; that she was such, and if so, why did he use the word 'now.' It was because up to th en the conjugal life of Abraham had been so pure and chaste that he had not gazed upon and beheld her face to face. It was only on approaching Egypt, Sara raised her veil, when her b eauty became manifested to Abraham. Another explana tion is, that during the fatigue and wearisomeness of a long journey the human body becomes shrunken and enfeeb led, but with Sara it was not so, for she had retained her b eauty of feature and form without the slightest cha nge or diminution. Observing this, Abraham used the word q uoted. A third and most likely reason is what has b een traditionally stated, that Abraham then beheld the Shekina or divine glory and presence about her that so affected him with a feeling of joy and delight that he excla imed, 'I see that thou art fair to look upon.' Know ing also the manners and customs then prevailing in Egypt, he co nsidered how to avoid the taking of Sara from him a nd therefore said unto her, 'Say I pray thee that thou art my sister.' This word sister (achath) has a tw o-fold meaning, one literal, the other allegorical or mystical, as in the verse, say unto Wisdom, tho u art my sister.' (Prov. VII. 4.) By Wisdom is here meant the Schekina, who is also call ed sometimes a sister. In inducing Sara to say thus , Abraham was guilty of causing her to prevaricate and utter a falsehood, as the Schekina was really with her, a nd becomes as a sister to every human soul that enters on the divin e and higher life, It is further added, 'that it ma y be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of the e.' These words were p. 348 addressed by Abraham to the divine glory, their mea ning being, 'that the Holy One may through thee do good unto me and my soul preserved and saved'81b-82a as it is only through the grace of the Holy Spirit that a m an on quitting earth life is accounted worthy of everlasting life. \" Said Rabbi Yessa: \"Though Abraham knew of the luxur ious manners and unchastity of the Egyptians, yet h e was not afraid of taking his wife thither, because the Schekina was with her and therefore he felt no appr ehension of the future.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"'And the Egyptians beheld the w oman that she was very fair.' Abraham had concealed his wife in a coffer, which when opened by the Egyptian exci se officers there flashed forth a light as bright a s that of the sun, and therefore it is said, 'she was very fair.' What they really beheld was a form other than that of S ara that remained visible after they had brought her out of the coffe r. This explains the somewhat pleonastic and simila r expressions: 'the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very f air,' and 'the princes also of Pharaoh saw and comm ended her before Pharaoh,'Gen. 12:15 because, as tradition as serts, they beheld the Schekina abiding with Sara.\" Said Rabbi Isaac, \"Woe unto the evil minded and unb elieving souls! who know nothing, nor care to under stand the doings and acts of the Holy One, therefore they per ceive not that every event that takes place in the world is arranged and ordered aforehand by him who sees the beginning and the end of all things ere they come t o pass, as it is written, 'Declaring the end from the beginning a nd from ancient times the things that are not yet d one.' (Is. XLVI. 10.) Observe, if Sara had not been brought before P haraoh, he would not have been visited with great p lagues, similar to those that afflicted the Egyptians in af ter years. In both cases the same term 'gedolim (gr eat)', is applied to them. 'And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his househo ld with great plagues (negaaim gedolim) and the Lor d shewed signs and wonders great (gedolim) and sore upon Egy pt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household.' (Deu ter. VI. 22.) From the use of the term 'great' we may infer that the plagues inflicted upon Pharaoh in the time of Abraham were the same in number if not in character as thos e in the time of Moses, and in both instances were done during night time.\" p. 349 Said Rabbi Isaac: \"It is written, 'But thou, oh Lor d, art a shield for me, my glory and the lifter up of my head.' (Ps. III. 4.) David said these words unto the Lord, 'Eve n though all men should stand up against me, I will not fear, for thou art my protector (a shield before me)'. Remark here the use of the word 'a shield (magen).' David at one time said unto the Holy One, 'Ruler of the world, wheref ore is it no form or prayer of benediction is found ending with my name like that of Abraham which the children of Israel address to heaven, and concluding with 'Bles sed be thou, oh Lord, protector of Abraham.' To which the Holy O ne replied, 'Abraham by enduring great protracted t rials, proved himself faithful and perfect.' Then said Dav id, 'If this be the reason examine me, oh Lord, and prove me and try my reins and my heart.' (Ps. XXVI. 2.) After hi s sin in connection with Bathsheba, David remembere d these words he had said unto the Holy One and exclaimed, 'Thou hast proved my heart, thou hast visited me in the night without finding--oh, that I had never spoken!

Yet, notwithstanding David 's weakness and frailty there is now a prayer of be nediction concluding with, 'Blessed art thou, oh Lord, protec tor of David.' This is why he said, 'Thou, oh Lord, art my protector (magen), my glory and the lifter up of my head' which he appraised more than his jewelled cr own and kingly sceptre.\" Next: Chapter LXXXVI. Kabbalistic Cosmology p. 350 82a KABBALISTIC COSMOLOGY IT is written, \"And Pharaoh commanded his men conce rning him and they sent him away and his wife and a ll that he had.\" Note that the Holy One is the protector of the upright that they may not fall under the power of evil and suffer injury from men of the world. Thus he delive red and saved Abraham and his wife. The Schekina re mained with Sarah during the whole night. Each time that P haraoh approached her, an angel obeying the command s of Sara struck him. Abraham, however, trusted in his Lord a nd rested assured that He would suffer no one to do her violence and had no apprehension of any evil befalling her, as it is written, \"the righteous are bold as a lion \" (Prov. XXVIII)Prov. 28:1 and in the hour of trial and dang er, remains steadfast and faithful and trustful in the Holy One. Said Rabbi Isaac: \"Abraham went down into Egypt wit hout first obtaining permission from the Holy One, who, however, did not forbid or prevent him going thithe r, as He knew that after the trial of his faith and steadfasteness the world would have no occasion to say that though God had sent Abraham into Egypt, he did not preser ve and save him from enduring trouble on account of Sarah. It is further stated, 'The righteous shall flouris h like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon' (Ps. X CII, 12). What does this comparison mean? This, tha t as the palm owing to pruning takes a long time ere it begins to bud and bear fruit, so when a righteous man depart s out of the world, a long time elapses before a similar one app ears and takes his place. This comparison may be fu rther extended, for as the male palm must be planted near a female of its own species in order that fructifi cation may take place, so is it with the upright, who are always jo ined and linked with an upright wife, as was the ca se with Abraham and Sarah. 'As a cedar in Lebanon.' As the cedar tr ee rises higher than all other trees that grow bene ath its branches, even so the righteous in their moral spiritual life exceed all others, to whom they are a protection. The world subsists and endures only by p. 351 the presence in it of the righteous, as it is writt en, 'The righteous are the foundation of the world' (Prov. X.25) and by the Just One was it brought into existence. Said Rabbi Jehuda: Are we not taught that it is bas ed upon seven columns, as it is written, 'Wisdom ha th built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars' (Prov. IX. 1).\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"That is very true, for the Just O ne upholds the seven pillars that sustain the world . He it is that waters it and nourishes it and to him the scripture refers, 'Say unto the Righteous One, it is good,82 a-82b for they shall eat of the fruits of their doings' (Is. III. 10), and also 'The Lord is good to all and his tend er mercies are over all his works'.\" (Ps. CXLV.)Ps. 145:9 Said Rabbi Isaac: \"The words, 'And a river went for th out of Eden to water the garden' refer to the pi llar on which the world stands. It is the river that watereth the garden of Eden and causeth fruits to abound that n ourish and sustain the world, that also establish the secret doctrine and bring forth the souls of the just who are the f ruits of the works of the Holy One, and because they are such, they ar ise each night and ascend on high, and at midnight the Holy One rules the garden of Eden to delight himself in thei r midst. It may be asked, whose souls are they?\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"With all the souls of the just, w hether yet living in the world below or those resid ing in the heavenly mansions in the world on high, He rejoices with all of them. Observe, the world above must fi rst receive an impulse from the world below and when the soul of a just man ascends into the celestial regions it bec omes garbed with a halo of light transcendently bright, which o bserving, the Holy One is pleased, for such a soul is the fruit of the divine operation within. For this reason such souls are called 'Israelites,' holy children, sons of Go d, as it is written, 'Ye are children of the Lord your God' (Deuter. XIV . 1).\" Said Rabbi Jose: Soncino: R. Yesa \"How does the Hol y One delight in souls living yet in the world?\" Said Rabbi Jose in reply: \"At midnight, all truth-l oving and seeking souls arise and engage in the stu dy of the secret doctrine, and hymns of worship.

XLII. 9). All worship at this time i s therefore true and perfect worship. Observe when the Holy One caus ed the first born in Egypt to be smitten, the child ren of Israel were safely enclosed within their houses chanting a nd singing praises unto him throughout the night. K ing David used to rise at midnight, for it cannot be imagined or supposed that he sang praises and composed psal ms in bed. He therefore said,82b 'At midnight I will arise to giv e thanks unto thee' (Ps. CXIX. 62). For this reason his kingdom will abide and he will reign even when King MusiahMusiah = Messiah comes, who, his tradition states, will b e called by his name whether David be yet alive or dead at the time of his coming, in expectation of which he alwa ys rose at midnight and sang, 'Awake up my glory, awake psalte ry and harp, I myself will awake early' (Ps. LXII. 8)Ps. 57:8. Observe that during the night Sarah was in Pharaoh' s house, the angels on high sang praises and worshi pped the Holy One who commanded (them to go and afflict the great ones in Egypt, and him I intend visiting in t he future, as it is written, 'And the Lord plagued Pharaoh with g reat plagues.' After this it is stated, And Pharaoh called Abraham.' How did he come to know that he was the husband of Sarah? It was through a dream, as was the case with Abimelech, to whom the Lord spake and said, 'Now, t herefore, restore the man his wife, for he is a pro phet'.\" (Gen. XX. 7.) Said Rabbi Isaac: 'We read, 'The Lord plagued with great plagues Pharaoh and his household, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.' Pharaoh, when the plagues first st ruck him, heard a voice saying, 'Because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.' Though God spoke the same words to Pharaoh a s to Abimelech, yet he learned from what was uttere d, who Sarah was, and therefore, as scripture states, 'And Pharaoh called Abraham, and commanded his people c oncerning him, 'in order that no injury should be done unto h im.' And they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had; that is, they led him to the boundary or frontier of Egy pt. The Holy One said unto Pharaoh, 'Thou wilt in l ikewise deal with Abraham's descendants'.\" Said Rabbi Abba, \"Why was Abraham subjected to such p. 353 a disagreeable and unpleasant incident, and why did the Holy One suffer it to befall him? It was in or der that the names of Abraham and Sarah might become magnified a nd known throughout the world, and especially among st the Egyptians, who at that time were regarded as magici ans par excellence, yet were they inferior to Abrah am, as it is stated, 'And Abraham went up (va-iaal) out of Egypt ' or ascended higher in Egypt. In what direction? I n or towards the south, or in other words, the higher and divine r mysteries.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"In the words, 'Abraham went dow n into Egypt,' and 'Abraham went up in Egypt,' is c ontained an occult reference to the mysteries of the Hidden Wisdom, for though Abraham descended into Egypt to be initiated into the occult science of that country, yet he suffered himself not to be seduced and delud ed thereby, but remained faithful and steadfast in the faith and wo rship of his divine lord and master. In this he was unlike Adam, who, notwithstanding the divine command, allowed hi mself to be deceived by the serpent, and thus cause d death to enter into the world. Neither followed he the examp le of Noah,83a who succumbed to evil as it is writt en, 'And he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncove red in his tent'Gen. 9:21 (oholoh) this word with a final meaning, Noah appeared naked in the tent of the Sch ekina. With Abraham it was otherwise, as it is writ ten, 'And he ascended in Egypt.' That is, after learning the occ ultism or secret meaning of evil, he turned from it and abused not occult science for sensuous gratification and purpo ses, owing to the Hidden Wisdom he had previously a cquired. It is stated that Abraham in ascending from Egypt went into the south (hanegebah), alluding to the high d egree in the knowledge of the mysteries he had attained before h is descent into Egypt. If Abraham had not gone down thither and been put to the test, he could not have manifes ted his faithfulness to the Holy One. Also, his des cendants, unless they had been tried and disciplined in Egypt, would never have come forth distinguished as the only na tion that the Holy One chose for his own portion. Also, if the Ho ly Land had not been inhabited by the Canaanites pr evious to the entry of the children of Israel into it, it would n ot have been the land under the rule and governance of the Holy One. In all these instances the same occult principle an d purpose prevailed.\" Next: Chapter LXXXVII. Kabbalistic Philosophy of th e Soul KABBALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOUL RABBI SIMEON, when on a journey accompanied by Rabb i Eleazar, his son, Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Jehuda, sa id: \"How astonishing it is that men give so little cons ideration to the study of the secret doctrine and t he precepts of the good law.83a It is written, 'My soul delights in th ee during the night, yea, my spirit within me seeks thee early' (Is. XXVII. 9).Is. 26:9 Though these words have been com mented upon, we will give a further interpretation of their meaning. When a man retires to rest at night, his n ephesh or soul leaves the body and ascends on high. If it be said so do all souls, it is not so, for not all ascend a nd behold the face of the king. When the soul leave s the body, its"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"connection with the body remains intact, by means o f what is termed the silver cord or magnetic tie. I n its ascent it passes through hosts of elementals, until it arrive s and reaches the region of light and purity. If fo und undefiled and untarnished by any immoral or unjust act and deed t ransacted during the previous day, it mounts still higher. If, on the contrary, it bears the least mark or stain of e vil, these elementary spirits gather around it, det erring its ascent with pleasing delusions of future happiness or with visi ons of delight that are never realized and fulfille d. In this state of false and deceitful dreaming, it remains during the night until it returns and, re-entering its body, becomes awake. Blessed are the righteous p. 355 to whom the Holy One reveals his secret things by v ision or dream so that they are forewarned and pres erved from coming and incumbent judgments and calamities. But woe unto those wrong and evil doers who corrupt the mselves both in body and soul. \"Note that when the pure and undefiled retire to re st, their souls ascending through all the interveni ng different hosts and degrees of elementary spirits, direct their cou rse towards the region of pure spirits, impelled an d guided thither by their own interior impulses and, ere the day daw ns, they enter into loving intercourse and converse with kindred souls, and, in company with them, behold the glory of the celestial King and visit his splendid temple s. He who has attained to this stage and state of spiritual devel opment in the higher and diviner life, will find an everlasting portion in the world to come, and also that his soul become s an ark to his real self and spirit ego and which, when unified and blended in one, the perfected being proceeds on its eternal ascent towards the Holy One, for from the divine has it, the83a-83b spirit ego comes forth, and unto the divine will it return at length. This is then what the psalmist meant,--'My soul longeth after thee in the night,' that is, desires to ascend to its source and will s uffer nothing to divert it from its course. \"The word nephesh (soul) designates the lower self in the time of sleep, whilst the term 'ruach' is ap plied to it in its state of wakefulness and activity on the earth plan e. The nephesh and ruach proceed from one and the s ame origin, being only productions of one principle, the spirit or higher self. So, then, as man is a; microcosm, a copy or paradigm of the universe, he is in his constitution a reflection of the divine nature, the Supreme Wis dom. The nephesh and ruach are the two angles at the base of a triangle and with that of the apex form a whole or perfect figure. When the neshama, the spiritual ego or high er self, prevails and rules within a man, he become s holy and divine, because he then begins to conform himself t o the image or likeness of the Holy One. The nephes h is the lower part of the individuality and its personal ma nifestation is the outward material body. Without t he one, the other could not exist. As the body is to the nephes h so is this nephesh to the ruach. The ruach is sup erior to the nephesh and is referred to in the words, 'Until the ruach (translated spirit) be poured upon us from o n high'. p. 356 [paragraph continues] (Is. XXXII. 15). The lower self, consisting of nep hesh and ruach, is susceptible of the influence of the neshama acting upon it. Thus there is a logi cal and intimate connection and relation between th ese three parts of every individuality, forming a scale of ascensio n from the nephesh to the neshama, whose nature and existence, its present connection with the soul and its own future state and destiny, is a most profound mystery. Though bey ond human comprehension, through and by meditation ther eon, we can rightly infer that all the grades of ex istence between the lowest and highest, between man and the zoophyte on the one hand and between man and archa ngel on the other, though infinite in number, are but terms in the infinite series of organic and inorganic li fe, the integration and summation of which is the Divine Himself, the l ife of all lives, the fount of all being. \"Note that the nephesh joined to the outward body h as the same relation to it as the lowest part of th e flame of a candle has to the wick from which it is never separ able and could not exist on or manifest itself apar t from it and form a basis or substratum to the higher and bright er part of the flame to which the wick and the dark or lower part of the flame give rise. Above all of them impercept ible to human vision there exists a higher and brig hter flame than its lower components, giving forth a clear and perf ect light. The same or similar relation exists betw een the component parts of every individual being, the high est of which and invisible to human eye, is the nes hama or divine part of man's nature and constitution, and s o when the nephesh, ruach and neshama are in harmon ic relation with each other, a man becomes holy through the div ine life that then flows into him, and qualifies hi m for the reception and perception of divine mysteries, as it is written, 'He makes known through the righteous that are on the earth, all that we wish to know of him' (Ps. XVI. 3 ). \"When Abraham entered the Holy land , the Holy One manifested himself unto him, as it i s stated, 'And the Lord appeared unto Abraham.' This was his first initiati on in the divine mysteries, the beginning of his as cension in the divine Ife, and therefore he built an altar as a sy mbol of the degree he had attained unto, after whic h he journeyed, going still towards the south, by which is signifie d, that passing through the various grades of initi ation, he attained to that of ruach, adeptship, and subsequently to th at of the neshama, symbolized p. 357"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"by the hexagon, that indicates the harmony and unio n of the higher and lower self with the Divine. Thi s attained unto, he built another altar corresponding thereto. This union with the Divine is the mystery of all m ysteries; but ere Abraham could attain unto this high degree of spiri tual life and knowledge, it was necessary to subjec t him to trial and probation, and therefore it was that he went do wn into Egypt; that is, he had to intermingle and c ome into personal contact and intercourse with the sinful wo rld, its seductions and charms, its allurements and enticements to sensual indulgence, against which Abraham resisted, suffering himself not to be deluded and beguiled, thereby standing firm and steadfast and impervious to all a ssaults, proved himself faithful to the great princ iples and dictates of the divine life to which he had attained; and th en, as stated, 'He ascended up out of Egypt toward the south, or in other words, he came out of his ordeal and period o f probation purified and inwardly illuminated, to b ecome regarded as a guide and paradigm to all other souls who are wearily climbing their way upwards on the steep and lofty spiral of the divine life. It is further adde d, 'And Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold.' 'Very rich' signifies the east, cattle the west, silver t he south, gold the north, the four quarters of the world, symbolizing totality of divine knowledge and wisdom.\" When Rabbi Simeon ceased his discourse, Rabbi Eleaz ar, along with the other students, saluted him with feelings of the deepest respect and reverence, and Rabbi Abba, deeply moved, spake and said: \"When thou leavest us where shall we find another master such as thou who will teach and indoctrinate us into the esoteric meaning of the secret doctrine? Blessed are they whose privilege it is to listen to the teachings and instruction that proce ed from thy lips.\" Next: Chapter LXXXVIII. Abraham's Initiatory Probat ion ABRAHAM'S INITIATORY PROBATION. AGAIN Rabbi Simeon spake and said: \"Observe further what is written, 'And he went on his journeys' (Ge n. XII. 3),83b-84a signifying that after the termination of his trials and probation he lived the perfect life . By the term journeys (masaav) is implied the various ulterior s tages through which Abraham had to pass ere arrivin g at perfection. There had been a descent from the time the Lord first appeared unto him; that is, a puttin g off or a ridding himself of affections and propensities and attachments of the lower self to the sensual and ph enomenal, resulting in purification of the soul which, when a ttained, prepared and enabled him to commence ascen ding onward and upward through the various states and stages of the divine life after coming out of Egypt; that is after his probation. It is stated, 'He went on his journeys f rom the south even into Bethel, the place where he had pitched his tent at the beginning'; he progressed and advanced in the divine life so that by the mental and spirit ual illumination which he ultimately attained, he became fully initi ated into the comprehension and understanding of th e mysteries of the Hidden Wisdom and graduated to that degree term ed 'teleiaor,' perfection, when it is written, 'And there Abraham called on the name of the Lord' (Gen. XIII. 4) and became a just man made perfect. Blessed are they who attain unto this degree of righteousness, for they become invested with an aureole of light and are je wels in the crown of the Holy One. Blessed are they in this wor ld and in. the world to come. Of these it is writte n, 'The path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day' (Prov. IV. 18).\" p. 359 As Rabbi Simeon ceased speaking, they came to a sha dy grove where they all sat down to rest themselves . After a while Rabbi Simeon began speaking again. \"It is written,\" said he, \"'O turn thou unto me and have mercy upon me' (Ps. LXXXVI. 16). Though these words have been commented on, they possess an esoteric me aning that has not as yet been given forth. They ar e occult words. What caused David to give expression to them ? David was longing and desiring to reach unto that state in the divine life which would be as a crown unto him; the refore, he said, 'Give thy strength unto thy servan t.' That is, the power that descends into the soul when it becomes r eceptive of the divine; as it is written, 'he shall give strength unto his king' (I Sam. II. 10), alluding to King Me ssiah, 'and save the son of thy handmaid.' Why did he designate himself as 'the son of thy handmaid' and not as the son of his father, Jesse? Because when a man enter s on the higher and diviner life he becomes as one born again of th e Schekina or Holy Spirit, through whom as through a mother all supplications and prayers are made and offered. Tra dition states that David in this petition makes ref erence to King Messiah. Next: Chapter LXXXIX. The Esoteric Explanation of L ot's Parting from Abraham "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE ESOTERIC EXPLANATION OF LOT'S PARTING FROM ABRAHAM. \"It is further stated of Abraham that there was a s trife84a Gen 13:7 between the herdsmen of Abraham's cattle a nd the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. The word strife (r iv) is here written with a yod (i), by which is indicated that Lot wished to return and relapse into his former st ate of idolatry and mingle in intercourse with the people of the la nd, as it is written, 'And the Canaanites and the P erizzites dwelled then in the land.' We are further confirmed in this inference by the words, 'and, Lot journeyed east' (miqqedem), or rather, 'from the east,' the word 'qedem,' as previ ously expounded, meaning the worship of God, and, g iving way to the inclinations and propensities of his lower natu re, went and dwelt among the inhabitants of the lan d in order to enjoy the delights and pleasures of a sensual and w orldly life. Observing this tendency in Lot, Abraha m inwardly grieving thereon, said unto him, 'Let there be no s trife, I pray thee, between thee and me; let us sep arate, for I perceive there can be no unanimity of faith and wor ship p. 360 between us. Thy heart goes out after and is fixed u pon the84a-84b phenomenal and sensual, mine after t he one eternal and true God and Lord of the universe.' \"Then it came to pass that they parted, Abraham unw illing to be associated with his kinsman in a life which he knew would prove a calamity to both of them because of t he sure and unavoidable doom of everyone who ignore s and disregards the divine life and refuses to obey the precepts of the Good Law. Of this, Jehosephat in al lying himself with the wicked Ahab was a remarkable example. But for divine goodness, he would have been slain along with his sinful companion, but perceiving his danger ere it was too late, it is written, 'He cried unto God and He helped him'; so that he escaped with his life, whilst the King o f Israel, the wicked Ahab, smitten and wounded, die d ere the sun went down. This was the reason Abraham was unwillin g to continue his intercourse with Lot, who chose a ll the plain of Jordan, preferring to indulge in the gay p leasures and obscenities of Sodom and Gomorrah rath er than live, following the divine light that had begun to dawn w ithin him, which would, as it did with Abraham, hav e led him safely through and enabled him to avoid and escape the dangers and resist and overcome the temptations that beset the path of every individual on his pilgrimage thro ugh earth-life. 'And Abraham dwelled in the land of Canaan,' to progress and go from faith to faith and to attain t he higher knowledge of the hidden wisdom, but Lot d welled in the cities of the plain, gravitating slowly and gradual ly toward Sodom, where he fired his tent at last to become engulfed in a world of vice from out which no human means co uld have entreated and saved him from the fearful a nd terrible doom that awaited those amongst whom he took up his abode. For as it is written, 'They were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.' Thus Abraham and Lot parted in peace, each of them going his own way and living their own lives, the one of the higher and divine, the other of the worldly and lower self. Blessed th e lot of those who choose that better part that shall never be tak en from them and whose delight is in the study of t he Secret Doctrine, its teachings and principles, and their j oy is in the consciousness of the divine presence. They are the true children of Israel, of whom it is written, 'He that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive, every one of you this day' (Deut. 1V.4).\" Next: Chapter XC. Remarks on the Schekina REMARKS ON THE SCHEKINA. Said Rabbi Abba: \"It is written, 'But Jonah rose up to84b flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord' (John I. 3). Jonah 1:3 Woe unto him who thinks to hide himse lf from the Holy One, of whom it is said, 'Can anyo ne hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him; do I hot fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord' (J er. XXIII. 24). Knowing this, how came Jonah to flee and go down to Tarshish thinking he could hide from the All-seein g? The explanation lies in the esoteric meaning of the wor ds, 'My dove (Ionathi) is in the clefts of the rock , in the secret receptacles on the stairs' (Cant. II. 14). 'My dove ' here signifies the congregation of Israel; 'in th e clefts of the rock' refers to Jerusalem, elevated above all parts of th e world as a rock is above the plain; 'in the secre t recesses on the stairs' denote that part of the temple called the H oly of Holies, the heart or center of the world; fo r there is the Schekina concealed from view like a faithful and vi rtuous wife who never quits the abode of her husban d, as it is written, 'Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in t he recesses of thy house' (Ps. CXXVIII. 3) . \"Such was the congregation of Israel when living ha ppy and blessed in the Holy Land with the Schekina in their midst. After her captivity and exile, the Holy Spir it departed and took up its residence amongst other nations and peoples who abound in plenty and peace. Observe, at the time Jonah dwelt in the Holy Land, everything went right, right worship and service prevailed throughout and thus Israel was the only people in the world that c ould cause the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"earth to be blessed and fruitful, owing to the divi ne presence in their midst. For this reason idolatr ous nations dared not attack Israel and were unable to gain dominatio n over it as at present, because all the world rece ived through Israel their needful supplies of food and sustenanc e. \"If it be objected that kings ruled and dominated I srael up to the destruction of the first temple, no te that during its existence and as long as Israel polluted not the Ho ly Land, other nations had no power over it. When, however, by their sins and idolatrous practices, they drove awa y the Schekina, thus compelling it to seek another residence, they lost their protection and shield against foreign na tions who were thus able to conquer and subdue them , through their foolish offering p. 362 and burning of incense to other strange gods. Whils t Israel dwelt in the Holy Land and was faithful an d true in its worship of the Holy One, the Schekina as a virtuous woman, in her own house remained with them and nev er left them and was the great inspirer of all the distingu ished prophets who lived during the existence of th e first temple. Jonah fled out of the Holy Land because he had not become endowed with the gift of prophecy and theref ore was unwilling to become a servant and messenger of the Holy One. If it be said that the Schekina manifeste d itself to Israel when in Babylon, which is far away from the Holy Land, our reply is, the Scripture states, 'The word of the Lord came expressly (hayo, haya)85a with Ezeckiel t he priest, son of Ruzi in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar' (Ez. I. 3). By the repetition here of the w ord haya (was) is indicated that from the time that the temple was erected in Jerusalem, the word of the Lord or the S chekina did not manifest itself elsewhere save in t he Holy of Holies. 'By the river Chebar,' it is intended to co nvey that it had previously appeared in that locali ty before the building of the temple, as it is written, 'And a ri ver went out of Eden to water the garden and from t hence it was parted and became into four heads, one of which was the river Chebar,' by which the Schekina occasiona lly appeared there, but only in times of Israel's need and distress. Therefore it was that Jonah fled out of the Holy Land to avoid its manifestation to himself; and the sail ors, we are informed, knew this, for he had told th em.Jonah 1:10 \"Observe that as the Schekina appears only at a tim e when it is needed, and in a suitable place, so it manifests itself only to persons qualified by some special or peculi ar gift to receive its communications. From the mom ent the desire arose in the heart of Lot to return to his former w orldly state of living, the Holy Spirit departed fr om Abraham, but immediately returned to him when Lot had separated and betaken himself from his intercourse with Abrah am, and thus it is written, 'The Lord said unto Abraham aft er Lot had separated from him . . .\" Observe when A braham learned of Lot's apostasy in the faith and worship of the Holy One, he greatly feared, and said to him self, is it because of my intercourse and relation with Lot tha t the divine life and light within me has become be dimmed and obscured? After the separation of the two kinsmen h ad occurred it is stated, 'God said to Abraham: Lif t up now thine eyes and look for the place where thou now p. 363 art.' These words meaning that by separation from L ot he had returned to his former state of spiritual illumination and inward assurance of the actuality and certainty of the divine presence with him, and therefore the Lord further added,85a 'Northward and southward, eastward and we stward,' referring to his previous journeyings, and then gave him to understand that he would be a shield unto hi m and that his presence henceforth should always ab ide with him, and added further, 'All the land that thou see st, to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever. ' The words, 'which thou seest,' in their esoteric meaning, refer to th e higher degrees of the divine life that had been m anifested unto him, when, as it is stated, 'He built an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.' This degree includes a nd is the synthesis of all other degrees and therefore it was said unto him, 'all the land which thou seest.' Next: Chapter XCI. Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Hezekiah , and Their Nocturnal Studies RABBI ELEAZAR AND RABBI HEZEKIAH, AND THEIR NOCTURN AL STUDIES. Rabbi Eleazar was once staying at a wayside inn in Lud , where he met with Rabbi Hezekiah. At midnight, as was his custom, he arose to meditate on the Secret Doct rine. His fellow student did the same. Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"An inn affords good opportunit ies to students for meeting together. It is written , 'As the apple tree amongst the trees of the forest, so is my belo ved among the children of men. I sat me down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my ta ste' (Cant. II. 3). The esoteric meaning of these w ords is this: The apple tree that is distinguished by its color from all other trees in the woods refers to the Holy One , the most desired of all beings. Therefore it is said, 'I sat me down under his shadow,' that is, under the divine and n ot of any other inferior celestial ruler. 'His shadow,' since when? From the time that Abraham appeared in the world, of whom it is written, 'Abraham my friend' (Is. XL. 8).Is. 41:8 T he words, 'and his fruit was sweet to my taste,' re fer to Isaac, who"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"was holy fruit. Another interpretation of 'I sat me down under his shadow with great delight' is that they refer to Jacob, as it is written, 'These are the children of Jacob,' whilst 'his fruit was sweet to my taste' d enote Joseph, whose children were the quintessence of the descendants o f Jacob, and because of this were called by the nam e of Ephraim, p. 364 as it is stated, 'Ephraim my dear son' (Jer. XXXI. 20). Also85-85b Abraham may be likened unto the app le tree among the trees of the wood, for his pure life was as a sweet perfume. By his faith and obedience to t he Holy One he far excelled others both in the world on high as th ose in the world below, and thus became distinguish ed as Abraham the Unique, to whom no man that has ever rested in the world is to be compared.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"Do not the words, 'The souls that they had gotten in Haran,' indicate that they were individuals who had attained the true faith, the sa me as Abraham?\" Said Rabbi Eleazar: \"They certainly refer to those who were converts to. Abraham's faith, yet they nev er attained unto his excellency in the divine life.\" Rabbi Eleazar here for some moments remained silent , and then said: \"It has just been said unto me tha t Abraham was not termed 'Unique' until after the birth of Is aac and Jacob, when all these three patriarchs beca me conjoined and regarded as the fathers of the faithful.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"What has been said unto you i s perfectly true. Whilst the 'apple tree among the trees of the wood,' and also 'my beloved among the children of m en,' together with 'under his shadow,' all refer to the Holy One; the words 'I sat me down with great delight' signif y the time when the Divine Presence was manifested on Mount Sinai and Israel received the Secret Doctrine and s aid, 'All that the Lord hath said, we will do and o bey' (Ex. XXIV. 7). 'And his fruit was sweet to my taste' signify t he Secret Doctrine, as it is written, 'Sweeter than honey and the honeycomb' (Ps. XIX. 11). Another interpretation ha s reference to the souls of the righteous, who are all the fruit of the works of the Holy One and dwell with him on hig h. Observe that all souls in the world are the frui t of his work before they become incarnated, and form one grand a ggregate which, after descending into the earth lif e, become separated and differentiated into male and female f orms that eventually become united. Observe that th e desire of the female towards the male induces in it a similar and corresponding feeling resulting in marriage. T his reunion is brought about and accomplished by the Holy One alon e, and not by any celestial chief or ruler. Blessed is the man whose life is pure and who walks in the path of tru th, for their p. 365 soul becomes united with soul as they existed befor e incarnation. He whose life is a pure and spiritua l life is the perfect man, of whom it is written, 'His fruit is s weet to my taste.' or he is not only blessed himsel f, but is a blessing to the world and we are able to conclude, therefore , that weal or woe, happiness or unhappiness, are t he results of our own acts, words and deeds.\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah to Rabbi Eleazar: \"Listen85b-86 a to what has been said to me. It is written, 'From me is thy fruit found' (Hes. XIV. 8).Hosea 14:8 This is what the Holy One said to the congregation of Israel, 't hy fruit,' and not 'my fruit,' meaning that as through the united desi res of the male and female fruit is born, or a soul is born, so it is with the union of the congregation of Israel with t he Holy One. They become united to them by the tie of holy and pure love resulting in holy fruit, as marriage does in the production of offspring.\" Next: Chapter XCII. Rabbi Jose on the Seven Heavens or Firmaments RABBI JOSE ON THE SEVEN HEAVENS OR FIRMAMENTS. Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'And it came to pa ss, in the days of Amrafel King of Shinar' (Gen. XIV. 1). In the prophecy of Isaiah we read, 'Who (mi) raised up the Just One from the east and called him to follow af ter him' (Is. XLI. 2). This verse has already been the subject of comment to the neophytes, being replete with the m ystery of the hidden wisdom that teaches that the Holy One create d seven firmaments or heavens above, wherein to man ifest his glory, all of them being based and founded on princ iples beyond human comprehension, which therefore r emain subjects of faith and not of knowledge. The highest of these heavens is altogether invisible and rules all those below it, and is therefore called mi (who), as it is writ ten, 'From the womb of Mi came forth the ice' (Job XXXVII. 28).Job 38:29 The lowest of these firmaments or heavens is void of light and non-luminous; and, because so, it is attached to those above it to receive it from them. It is disti nguished from them by the letters 'y' and 'm' and c alled yam (the sea), and such it really is to the highest heavens termed Mi (the same letters changed in their order) . All the higher firmaments pour their light into it, as rivers disc harge their waters into the sea, so that this lower heaven produces fruit, fish, after their species. David refers to i t in the words, 'The great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable, both p. 366"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"small and great beasts' (Ps. CIV. 25). 'Who raised up or called the Just One to come from the east' al ludes to Abraham, and 'to follow him' refer to this lower he aven that forms, as just stated, a sea to the highe r heavens above it. It is further added, 'and cast down nations bef ore him.' To whom are these words to be applied? To the lower heaven, also that avenges the oppressed and causes their enemies to fall and be destroyed. In speaking of it David said, 'Thou hast given me the necks of my enemies a nd destroyed them that hate me' (Ps. XVIII. 40). Th e above words refer also to Abraham, whose enemies the Holy One caused to be destroyed. Again it is further ad ded, 'and made him rule over kings,' that is, those celestial chiefs that are set over nations as rulers, and pr otectors who are chastised at the same time that the nation or peopl es under their control are afflicted86a with divine judgments. 'He pursued after and passed safely'Is. 41:3 refer to A braham, who pursued his enemies without harm or suf fering to himself, for the Holy One destroyed them from befor e him and 'he passed safely,' or rather, 'peace wen t before' (yaabor shalom), leaving no traces behind; that is, the Holy One who is sometimes called 'Peace,' inti mating that either concealed and hidden by a cloud, or carried in a chariot, Abraham passed through the land inste ad of marching through it on foot. Now scripture states i t was no angel or divine messenger, but the Holy On e who went before him; 'with his feet,' that is, with angels t hat are subordinate to him; as it is written, 'And his feet shall stand in that day,' etc. (Zach. XIV. 4). According to anothe r interpretation of the words, 'Mi (who), raised up or brought the just One from the east,' it is affirmed that after creation of the world the Holy One determined to br ing Abraham into it, that he might serve him and become a progenitor of Jacob and the twelve tribes of Israel, who, lik e their forefathers, were servants of the Holy One. The eso teric meaning of these words, therefore, is that he called Abraham, the just One, out of the east to serve him and do his will, as it is stated, 'Get thee out an d all the people that follow thee' (that are at thy feet) (Ex. XI. 8 ). A further exposition is that the words refer to the east, where the light first dawns and illuminates the south and is pressed by Mi heir (who raised), whilst by 'called the Just One to follow him' have reference to the west. The mystic meaning of the whole verse is that p. 367 the West will eventually be able to subdue all othe r nations receiving accessions of power and numbers from the East, in the world.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Who has called the Just One to come from the east' refer certainly to Abraham, for from observing the rising of the sun in the east he obta ined the first true conception of the Holy One and reasoned then within himself, 'This sun is the king who created m e.' He therefore bent in adoration before it and wo rshipped it all that day. Then, however, the sun set and the moon a rose and began to shine. 'This truly,' said he, 'is the deity and rules over the sun whom I have been worshipping all the day, whose light and splendor have faded and g iven way to that of the moon who now rules supreme.' He thereup on worshipped it all through the night. In the morn ing he observed the moon disappear and the sun arising aga in from the east, and said to himself, 'Surely abov e those kings there is some other and higher power that rules and governs and commands their obedience.' Then the Ho ly One, seeing the desire of Abraham for divine knowledge r ising within him, manifested himself unto him and s pake86a unto him as it is written. He called the just One t o follow him; that is, he made himself, both by sig ht and speech, known unto Abraham.\"NdM omits pages 86b-91b Next: Chapter XCIII. Kabbalistic Remarks on Marriag e KABBALISTIC REMARKS ON MARRIAGE. SAID Rabbi Eleazar: \"It is written, 'What shall we do for wives for them that remain?' (Jud. XXI. 7), and further it is added, 'Therefore they commanded the children of Be njamin saying, go and lie in wait in the vineyards and catch you every man his wife, and see and behold if the d aughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances; the n come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you91b-92a every ma n his wife of the daughters of Shiloh.' This incide nt in connection with the tribe of Benjamin shows how a m an may and can become the husband of one who is the sister soul of another, and how as tradition teaches us, b etrothment may take place during a feast through fe ar lest another may pray to obtain the betrothed herself. On furthe r reflection you will discover and understand the m ystery or secret law that governs marriage, which is similar to that which operates when a man marries and dying leaves no offspring. When that happens, his widow is bound to espouse her late husband's brother. If she brings forth a son, he is animated with the soul of his defunct father who incarnates a second time within him. This son find s no wife who is his sympneumata because this animates his own mo ther. Therefore, esoteric students declare that it is permissible to celebrate betrothals during feast days, lest ano ther, by his ardent p. 369 prayers addressed to heaven, may obtain her who is about to become betrothed, as it is possible by suc h means to obtain a wife whose soul is the sister or twin of a nother man.\""},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Truly the subject of marriage m ust be of the greatest anxiety to the Holy One. Ble ssed is the lot of Israel who enjoys the secret doctrine that teach es them His Holy way, as also the secrets and myste ries attending them. It is written, 'The law of the Lord is perfec t converting the soul' (Ps. XIX. 7). Blessed is he who studies in it and rules his life thereby, for then he acquires le ngth of days and learns the secret of life, as it i s written, 'For length of days and long life and peace shall it add to the e .'\" (Prov. III. 2). Next: Chapter XCIV. On the Study of the Secret Doct rine ON THE STUDY OF THE SECRET DOCTRINE. Said Rabbi Jose: \"We read, 'And Abraham was ninety- nine years old' (Gen. XVII. 1), and also, 'Thy peop le are all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever' (Is . LX. 21). Blessed is Israel above every other peop le, for the Holy One calleth them righteous. We learn by tradition92 a that there are a hundred and twenty-eight thousan d winged messengers who fly throughout the world, listening to the cry of sorrow and the voice of joy or pain a nd suffering, proceeding from man and beast and bird, all of whic h with their prayers are gathered and borne by thes e angelic beings up before their lord, who judges accordingly as intimated by the words, 'Because a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter' (Eccles. X. 20). When are the judgments res ulting from these voices and cries and prayers executed and car ried out?\" Said Rabbi Hiya: \"When a man falls asleep, his nech ama or higher self leaves him and, ascending on hig h, gives account of his deeds and acts and words; therefore is it written, 'Keep the doors of thy mouth even fr om her who sleepeth near thee' (Mich. VII. 5), alluding to the soul of man.\" Said Rabbi Jehuda: \"Every deed, act or word a man s peaks or does, the higher self or 'neshama' has to give an account of it. It was the teaching of Rabbi Eleazar , that ere the evening begins with the setting of t he sun, the angels or mighty ones of the signs of the zodiac, close th e gates of its constellations that have been open d uring the day. Then p. 370 the voice of a herald cries aloud: Assemble and gat her yourselves together! As they ascend in silence on high, those who gather up the world cries and prayers descend a nd go on their mission through the world. When the moon begins to shed her light upon the earth, these wing ed messengers sound their trumpets in unison and gi ve forth a sound as the shout of great joy. They blow them aga in when a plaintive sound is heard and then present ly myriads of angelic beings begin chanting hymns and praises bef ore their Lord and Master, after which the judgment of the world commences. Then it is when we sleep, our high er selves quit us and give in their account of us a nd by the grace and goodness of the Holy One are ordered to r eturn and come back again to us, even when we have done and said things we ought not to have done. After midnig ht when the cock crows and birds begin to waken up, a wind from the northwest commences to92a-92b blow, which is met by a current from the south. Then it is that the Holy One delights himself in the souls of the just in th e garden of the heavenly Eden. Happy and blessed is he whose delight is to rise and study and meditate on the Se cret Doctrine, for then the Holy One with all the s ouls of the just made perfect, listen and attend to his voice, as it is written, 'Thou who dwellest in the gardens, thy companions listen to thy voice, cause me to hear it' (Cant. VIII. 13) . More than this, the Holy One surrounds him who ri ses at midnight for study with an aura of light (chesed) to keep an d protect him whilst on earth, so that angels above and below become his guardians, as it is written, The Lord wi ll command his loving kindness in the day time and in the night season, his song shall be with me' (Ps. XLII. 9).\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"Everyone who, rising at midni ght, studies and meditates on the secret doctrine e njoys a lasting (thader) portion in the world to come.\" \"What,\" said Rabbi Jose, \"does the word 'thader' me an?\" Said Rabbi Hezekiah: \"Hear what I have been ta ught. Every midnight when the Holy One enters the garden of Eden, all its plants (the souls of the Just) are then refreshed by the water of the river Qedumim, known as the bea utiful stream\" (nahaladanim) that flows through the universe, and he who studies the secret doctrine at midnight comes into relationship and communion with the soul s of the just made p. 371 perfect on high, and finds himself refreshed and st rengthened for as soon as they hear his voice, they are filled with great delight and impart to him the water of life b y which they are themselves refreshed and which con tinually flows forth from under the throne of God on high. This be ing so, is the92b reason why he who studies at midn ight the secret doctrine is sure of a lasting (thader) suppl y each night from the water of the river of life. Next: Chapter XCV. Rabbi Abba's Visit and What Occu rred "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"RABBI ABBA'S VISIT AND WHAT OCCURRED. Rabbi Abba of the town of Tiberias went on a visit to his father-in-law, accompanied by his son, Rabbi Jacob, to attend a meeting of novitiates of the Hidden Wisdom . On arriving at the village of Tarsha, they decide d to stay there for the night. The keeper of the inn, when Rabbi Ab ba asked him whether there was a \"Tarnagula\" on the house (a cockbird) replied, why do you ask such a question? In order, said Rabbi Abba, that at time of midnight I may not fail to rise and engage in the study of the secret doctr ine. Let that not trouble you, rejoined the inn-kee per, for we have an alarum in the house that never fails to strike a nd ring at the hour of midnight. It was the inventi on of an old man who used to stay here. He was an esoteric student a nd most punctual he was in rising at midnight to st udy. Said Rabbi Abba: \"Blessed be the Merciful One who g uided us hither.\" When midnight arrived, the clepsydra or alarum soun ded and was heard throughout the house and awakened Rabbi Abba and his son who, on rising, heard the inn-keep er, seated on the threshold of the door, saying to his two sons: \"It is written, 'At midnight I will rise and give t hanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments' (Ps. CXIX. 62). Why did David say 'midnight' (khatzoth lailah) inst ead of 'at midnight' (bekhatzoth lailah) I will ris e, etc. It was because that by this word (midnight) he denotes and distinguishes the Holy One Himself.\" Then spake the two sons and said: \"Did David really call upon and address Him thus?\" \"Truly he did,\" replied their father, for at the ex act hour of midnight the Holy One enters the garden of Eden to enjoy intercourse with the souls of the righteous.\" p. 372 Said Rabbi Abba to his son, Rabbi Jacob: \"If we go9 2b and join them in their study, the presence of th e Schekina will most certainly be with us.\" They went and sat with their host and said, repeat the words you have just spoken, for they are excellent. Who was your teacher?\" He replied: \"The old man that formerly stayed here. He also told me that during three hours before mid night angels, deputed to take record of the deeds of men that jud gment might be pronounced upon them, fly through th e world and return at the exact moment when the Holy One enters the garden of Eden. All the judgments that befall men and the sentences decreed in the world above thus become op erative. Where do we learn this? From the history o f Abraham, of whom it is written, 'And he separated the night for them' (Gen. XIV. 15), and also from what is sai d regarding the plague of the Egyptians, 'And it came to pass that at midnight, the Lord smote all the first born in t he land of Egypt' (Ex. XII. 29). In many other places of scripture th e old man taught me the esoteric meaning of the wor d midnight, of which David himself was well aware, and knew that h is royalty and sovereignty depended on \"Midnight\" a nd therefore he rose at that time and composed psalms and called the Holy One by this term, in order as h e says, 'to praise thee for thy righteous judgments' which desc end from on high at the division of day and night. David knowing that his occupancy of the throne depended u pon the divine 'Midnight,' he rose as we have just said to sing praises and give thanks to the King of Kings.\" Said Rabbi Abba, as the host ceased speaking: \"True are the words thou hast spoken and blessed he the Lord who has directed our steps and guided us hither.\" He th en embraced him and said: \"Observe that night is th e time of judgment everywhere, as we have learned from Rabbi Simeon.\" One of the inn-keeper's sons here asked the question: \"If,\" said he, to hi s father, \"what you have learned is true, why did David say, 'In the middle of the night?'\" The father replied: \"Because, as we have stated, at that time the rule and sovereignty of the Holy One makes itself felt by everyone.\" Said the son: \"There is another explanation which h as been imparted to me.\" p. 373 92a Said Rabbi Abba: \"Speak, my boy, and give it forth as I think the Voice of the SilenceVoice of the Lam p--Soncino has spoken unto thee.\" The boy spake and said: \"Night is the time when jud gments are decreed and determined upon, and during night they are executed in all places above and below. Why Dav id used the term 'middle' was because the night is divided into two periods; the first of judgment, the other of me rcy that causes the faces of all to become radiant with feelings of joy and delight.\" Said Rabbi Abba, placing his hands on the head of t he boy and blessing him, \"I have always thought tha t wisdom was only to be found with those worthy of receiving it, now I see that in the life time of Rabbi Simeo n, children are able to become possessors of heavenly wisdom and li ght. Blessed art thou, Rabbi Simeon. Woe to the wor ld when thou goest hence.\" Until daybreak they continued th eir studies of the Secret Doctrine. Next: Chapter XCVI. A Feast of the Circumcision "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"A FEAST OF THE CIRCUMCISION. SAID Rabbi Abba: \"Scripture states, 'All thy people are93a righteous.' These words have been explained by the students initiates. Why are thy people called right eous? Were all the children of Israel upright and j ust? Were there not amongst them sinners and transgressors against the commandments of the law? Certainly there were. But let us learn from tradition what it teaches us respecting the esoteric meaning of these words. Blessed the lo t of Israel who offer up sacrifices. The will of the Holy One is th at they should sacrifice their sons to him on the e ighth day after birth, from which time and after they become recipi ents of the good part that will never be taken from them, as it is written, 'The righteous One is the foundation of th e world' (Troy. X. 25). When the rite of the covena nt is duly performed, children enter into the blessing of the Holy One and are then accounted just and righteous, and therefore it is written of them, 'They shall inherit the land forever,' and also, 'Open unto me the gates of the righteous (zadecq) one that I may enter in; and further, 'This is the gate of the Lord, and the righteous shall enter the rein' Ps. CXVIII. 20). Those who are circumcised are therefore termed righteous, and as we read, 'They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting' (Is. LX. 21),Ps. 37:39 w hich the Holy One has planted in the garden of Eden . Now the earth below is one of these plants, and therefore t he children of Israel have a good part in the world to come and, as just stated, shall inherit the land p. 375 forever. The esoteric meaning of the word \"forever\" has already been explained. The letter He (H) is n ot found in93a, 86b the name of Abraham until after his circ umcision, when from Abram it was changed to Abraham . Then it was that the Schekina became attached to and abode with him, and therefore it is written, 'These are t he generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created .' Now from tradition we are informed that the word 'behibaram' (when they were created) should be read, 'behe bara m' (by or through Abraham). It may be objected, how can it be said the heavens and the earth were created by Abra ham, who corresponds to the Sephir Hesed (mercy) on the Tree of Life, since we know also from tradition that the word 'belubaram' signifies that the heavens and th e earth were created by the Schekina, of which the letter H is t he symbol? Our reply is that these two traditions a re not really contradictory to each other, but refer and amount t o the same thing.\" Said Rabbi Jacob to his father, Rabbi Abba:from \"Sa id Rabbi Jacob\" to \"As a token of his covenant\" (ne xt paragraph) omitted in Soncino \"The letter H in 'beh ibaram' is found written smaller in size than the o ther letters composing the word, but in the word halayehorah, wh ich is found beginning the verse, 'Do ye thus requi te the Lord, oh foolish people and unwise' (Deuter. XXXII. 6)., it is written larger than the other letters in the Pentateuch . What is the reason of this difference between the two H' s?\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"The first H denotes that degree o f divine life within the soul or lower self, that c orresponds in signification with the sabbatical year that symboli zes it; the second larger H, that heavenly state of which the Jubilee is the symbol. Now, though the moon is at one time new and at another full, yet it is always one and t he same notwithstanding its various phases, so is it with t he mysterious Schekina that is distinguished by the smaller or larger letter H. Blessed is the lot of Israel in whom the Holy One delights more than any of her nation or pe ople. As a token of his covenant with them, they perform the r ite of circumcision, which whoever bears it shall n ever enter into Gehenna, for if he lives a chaste life, he will nev er be overcome by temptation nor break the vow take n in the name of the heavenly king. When a parent arranges and pr epares for his son to enter into the covenant of ci rcumcision, the Holy One summons all his celestial angels and says, 'Observe the child I have created in the world.' T hen the prophet Elijah immediately p. 376 descends at the time of the ceremony and takes the9 3a-93b seat that has been placed apart for him and which the father is bound by law to declare at the same time, 'This seat is for Elijah the prophet.' Otherwise, the prophet refrains from taking it and forthwith ascends and t estifies before the Holy One of what has occurred. Observe that at first the scriptures state, 'And the Lord came unto him and said, 'What doest thou here, Elijah?' And Elijah answered and said, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord Go d of hosts, because the children of Israel have for saken thy covenant a,' (1 Kings XIX. 9-10). Then said God unt o him, 'I swear by thy life that wherever and whene ver my children shall practice and obey my covenant, there shalt thou be present and thy mouth which now test ifies that the children of Israel have forsaken my covenant, shall also testify when they keep it.' We are also taugh t by tradition that Elijah was punished for making himself the acc user of God's children.\" Thus they continued their studies in the secret doc trine until the day began to dawn, when Rabbi Abba and his son prepared to go their journey. Then spake the inn-ke eper and said: \"Ere you leave us, finish your remar ks on the subject on which you have discoursed.\" On asking hi m what subject he meant, he answered: \"Tomorrow you will behold and come into the presence of the Master who will be present here. It is the earnest desire and wish of my wife that you stay with us, as our son who has just been born unto us will be circumcised tomorrow.\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Said Rabbi Abba: \"The wish is a command, and we sha ll rejoice in seeing the Schekina and will postpone our departure.\" They stayed until the following night, when there was a gathering of all the friends of th e host, who spent the time in the study of the secret doctrine, and no one slept that night. Next: Chapter XCVII. p. 377 93b \"I WOULD like,\" said the host, \"each one of you to give forth, according as he is able, some new idea or thought relative to the secret doctrine.\" Then spake one of the guests and said: \"It is writt en, 'Praise ye the Lord, for the avenging (biproa p eraoth) of Israel when the people willingly offered themselves' ( Jud . V. 2). Wherefore did Deborah and Barak begin this song with these words? We learn from tradition that the world stands and is established only on the divine coven ant. As long as Israel continues to obey and conform to it by th e rite of circumcision it will abide stable, but if it should, be which God forbid, that Israel neglect their duty and igno re the covenant, then the blessings accruing from t he observance of it will cease coming into the world. Observe, no ot her nation or people will ever rule over Israel so long as it abides true and faithful to the covenant. What mean these words, 'Faithful to the covenant?' They indicate that when the command respecting the rite attached to the covenan t is ignored, or in other words, when the worship o f God is forsaken as was the case in the time of Deborah, as it is written, 'And the children of Israel did evi l in the sight of the Lord and served Baalim and He delivered them into t he hands of Sisera' (Jud. IV. 2); the meaning of th ese words is that they forsook God; that is, they neglected to p erform the initiatory rite attached to the covenant which their forefathers, the patriarchs, had inaugurated and pe rformed. When Deborah, however, appeared, she broug ht them to a sense of their infidelity towards God, so that th ey willingly and of their own accord (behithnadeb) returned to the observance of the law respecting the p. 378 [paragraph continues] 'persia' 1 and found that obedience brought them blessings, t ogether with overthrow and defeat of their enemies. We also learn from tradition that the Holy One said unto Joshua, 'The children of Is rael are impure, they have ceased obeying93b the law respecting 'per sia' and so have not entered into the covenant, and thou wishest to lead them into the holy land and overthrow their enemies, go and circumcise the children of Israel again.' And not until they had conformed to this injunction were th ey able to enter the Promised Land and conquer thei r foes. The same thing occurred when Deborah appeared; and when by obedience they returned to the path of duty, victory attended their arms and blessings were again shower ed upon them and the world. This is why it is writt en, 'biproa peraoth' and by obeying the law respecting it willi ngly and of their own accord, they were able to say , 'barcou Iehovah,' praise for the renewal of his blessings.\" Said another guest: \"It is written, 'And it came to pass as Moses was journeying, the Lord met him in the inn and sought to kill him' (Ex. IV. 24). The question may here b asked, kill whom? Moses or his son. Moses mo st certainly, for the Holy One had said unto him: 'Thou art going to bring forth Israel out of Egypt and vanquish a great king and ruler, yet thou forgettest and neglectest to circum cise thy own son.' For this gross neglect on his pa rt, he sought to kill him. Now we learn from tradition that the arch angel Gabriel descended at this moment, enveloped i n flaming fire to consume Moses and a serpent leaped out of i t to destroy him. But why a serpent? The Holy One h ad said to Moses: 'Thou intendest to go and kill a mighty and powerful despot (pharaoh) and hast not circumcised thy son.' Then made he a sign to the serpent to kill him. At that moment Zepporah, his wife, appeared and, takin g the boy, performed the rite at once, when the serpent let go his hold on Moses, as it is written, 'Then Zepporah took a sharp stone (tzour) and circumcised the son' (Ex. IV. 25) . What does the word 'tzour' here denote? A remedy, an antidote, which was the rite of circumcision, to the performa nce of which she was impelled by an inner inspirati on of the Holy Spirit, and thus saved the life of her husband .\" Then spake another guest and said: \"It is written, 'And Joseph said unto his brethren, come near me, I pray you' (Gen. XLV. 4); and they came near. Wherefore spake Joseph p. 379 thus, as his brethren were already near him? It was because when he said unto them, 'I am Joseph your brother' they became filled with amaze and astonishment, seeing h im head ruler of Egypt. Then said Joseph: \"This is the cause of my elevation to the high position I occupy,\" and ma nifested the sign of the covenant he bore upon him. From this we infer that success and prosperity in life accrue sooner or later to everyone who observes the rite of the covenant and keeps himself pure and chaste. We are confirmed in. this by the example of Boaz, concerning whom we re ad, 'As the Lord liveth, lie down until the morning' (Ruth III. 13). The tempter wished to lead Boaz into sin; but faithful and true to his oath, he resisted the temptation and th us kept pure the sign of the covenant. Therefore, h e was honored in giving birth to those whose offspring became kings and rulers over all other kings, and also of becomi ng the ancestral progenitor of King Messiah who is called by the name of the Holy One."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Another guest spake and said: \"It is written, 'Thou gh a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear, though war should rise against me, in this (bezoth) will I be confident' (Ps. XXVII. 3). The word \"bez oth\" here denotes the sign of the covenant a man bears here b elow as on high, and this is why David said, 'In th is will I be confident.' It is written, 'Zoth is the sign of the covenant' (Gen. IX. 12). 'Zoth is my covenant.' Th ese zoths refer to one and the same sign of the divine life. We learn from tradition that ze, male, and zoth, female, are one and never separate. If it be said, then everyone, whether bea ring the mark of the covenant or not, enjoys the bl essings of it. Why should not everyone, as well as David, say the same words? But David was united with and enjoyed t he presence of the Schekina, of which he was an image by virtue of the royal crown or diadem he wore. Obs erve, it was owing to his failure in preserving zoth in all its purity, that the kingdom was taken from him for a p eriod, as tradition states. This zoth is impressed on the celestial kin gdom as on Jerusalem the Holy City. When David by h is sin in connection with Bathsheba transgressed against it, a voice from on high called unto him and said, 'Tho u shalt reap the fruit of thy deeds. Thou shalt be ejected out o f Jerusalem and the kingdom shall be taker from the e.' We learn this from the words of scripture, 'Behold, p. 380 [paragraph continues] I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house' (2 Sam. XII. II). Thus was David punished for breaking the covenant by his unchastit y; and, as it was with him, so will it be with all others who likewise transgress against it.\" Another guest spake and said: \"It is written, 'Unle ss the Lord had been my help, my son would have dwe lt in silence (duma)' (Ps. XCIV. 17). Through what are the childr en of Israel blessed that they descend not into Geh enna and come under the power of the angel Duma like other i dolatrous nations' Because, as tradition informs us , when a man leaves the world, hosts of angels, the executors of justice, approach him, but on perceiving the sacre d sign or token of the covenant he bears on him, they leave him and trouble not to deliver him unto the hands of Duma who sentences men to descend into Gehenna, the fate and doom of all those who are delivered into his power . The man who by chastity preserves himself pure, fears no ju dgment for he is united with the name of the Holy O ne. David failed to do this and in consequence lost his kingd om and was driven out of Jerusalem and feared great ly that the avenging angels would consign him into the hands of Duma, which would have meant for him eternal death (the annihilation of the soul through absolute separatio n from the higher self). This fear and terror abode with him until Nathan, the prophet,94a announced unto him the good news, 'The Lord hath taken away thy sin so thou sh alt not die.'2 Sam. 12:13 Then was it that David said, 'If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would have d welt in hell.'\" Another guest spake and said: \"'If I shall find fav or in the eves of the Lord, he will bring me again and make me to sec his sign (otho) and his tabernacle' (2 Sam. XV. 25). Who can see the Holy One? Tradition states th at when judgment was decreed and passed upon David, he knew it was owing to his sin in violating the sign of t he covenant, for punishment attends everyone who transgresses ag ainst it and observes not its obligatory duties, wh ich, if not performed, no one is accounted just, if he keep not himself pure and chaste in deed and thought. Knowi ng this, David prayed, 'If I find favor in the eyes of the L ord, he will answer me and make me to see his sign (otho) and tabernacle,' or as these words may be paraphrased, God grant me to see his holy token, for I tremble a nd fear because I have lost p. 381 mine. What is meant by 'the token of God?' It denot es the sovereignty of Israel and Jerusalem. Nov he who lives unchastely forfeits the mark or token of God, that is. the divine life in the soul.\" Another guest spake and said: \"It is written, 'And in my flesh shall I see my God, Eloha' (Job XIX. 26 ). What is meant by this expression, 'in my flesh'? Why said h e not, rather, 'in myself'? If he really said 'in m y flesh,' what did he mean? Job here alludes to the flesh which script ures mentions, 'The holy flesh they have soiled' (y aabrou) (Jer. XI. 15), and also, 'My covenant shall be in your fl esh for an everlasting covenant' (Gen. XVII. 13). W e are taught whenever a man bears this token on him, he sees the Holy One himself, and when this occurs it is throu gh the unification of the lower and higher selves, resulti ng in the Beatific Vision. If, however, he does not preserve purity of thought and act, scriptures states, this union c eases and becomes broken, and the soul or lower sel f perishes, going back and becoming resolved into its original elemen ts out of which it has been prepared and built up, like as the material body returns to the dust out of which it h as been formed; and therefore it is written, 'They lose the breath divine (minishmath Eloha).' The divine Schekina nev er separates from one who by his pure life and fait hful obedience observed the good law, or covenant. If it be asked, when does the holy Spirit or divine life manifest itself in a man? it is when the union we have just mention ed is effected. It is the true, the divine, marriag e when they twain become one flesh. From tradition we learn why the letters V and H are placed together in their a lphabetical order. Vau being the symbol of the male and He that of the female principle, which are united and oper ate in combination with each other, as husband and wife, a nd from one becoming invested with a nimbus or cove ring of divine light that emanates from the male principle and known in scripture as grace (chesed), as it is written, 'The"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"goodness (chesed) of God endureth continually' (Ps. LII. 1). This ray of divine light comes through th e Sephira \"supreme Wisdom\" and penetrates the male principle, which is communicated to the female. Another tradi tion states that the name Aloha is separable into, al, V and H, al designating the light of wisdom, V the male pri nciple and H the female principle, and their totality form Aloha . p. 382 [paragraph continues] The holy soul or higher self, as it has been state d, is in intimate relationship with the nephesh or soul only so long as it keep itself pure and preser ve intact the holy covenant, and therefore it is wr itten, 'In my flesh shall I see God' (Aloha) (Job XIX. 26). A pure life , a pure soul, are reciprocal and convertible terms and never separated. Happy the lot of those who, attached to the Holy One, live the divine life, both in this wo rld and the world to come. Of them it is written, 'Ye who have become joined unto the Lord your God are alive everyone o f you this day' (Deuter. IV. 2). For theirs is the one true an d divine life that they live.\" After the guest had ceased speaking, Rabbi Abba add ressed them thus: \"How is it,\" said he, \"that so me ntally and spiritually enlightened, you are content to reside and live in such an obscure place, and are so verse d in the teachings of the secret doctrine?\" They answered and said: \"When the young birds leave their nests they know not whither to go, as it is written, 'As a bird wandereth from its nest so is a man that wande reth from his place' (Prov. XXVII. 9). Now this place i s our nest and is suitably adapted for study of the secret doc trine. During the first part of the night we sleep. The other part we devote to study. When daybreak begins, the refreshi ng morning breezes and the light of the sun so invi gorates us that we apply ourselves with renewed energy to medi tation, and readily assimilate, digest and understa nd the teachings that come into our minds. A great calamit y once happened in this place and a great many of i llustrious and learned teachers perished, and which they might hav e escaped but for their neglect in the study of the secret doctrine. Made wise from their example and fate, we study assiduously by day and night, preferring to remain here because its situation is highly favorable and helpf ul to a student of life. He who leaves it would be as foolish as he who takes away his own life.\" On hearing these words, Rabbi Abba raised his hands and blessed them. They were all sitting together a nd when day began to dawn, it was said to the young people who were there, \"Go out and see if it is daybreak, and if it be so, then let each one address something to our excellent and esteemed guest, Rabbi Abba, and some remarks on th e secret doctrine.\" Footnotes 378:1 \u0001פרהסיא\u0001 , from \u0001פרס\u0001 , to declare openly--JBH. Next: Chapter XCVIII. p. 383 94b THEY went out of the house and found the sun had al ready risen above the horizon. Then said one of the m: \"Today fire will descend from on high.\" Said another: \"It will descend upon this house and envelope someone i n flames.\" A third said: \"It will be one who is in our midst and well on in years.\" \"God forbid that this should happen,\" exclaimed Rab bi Abba, who was exceedingly troubled, so that he w as unable to speak. After a few moments, he became composed a nd said: \"I perceive heaven is communicating to the earth and predicting through these children, events that will occur during the day.\" The predictions proved true, respecting Rabbi Abba, for the joy he felt in the study of the secret doc trine was so great that his countenance and head became irradiat ed with a nimbus of light. All that day, the guest remained in the house and none went out of it. It was surrounded wi th something similar to a thin cloud of mist, and t he friends assembled p. 384 there experienced a sense of inward joy and delight so intense as that which was felt by the children of Israel when they received the law at Mount Sinai. So intent and absorbed were the guests in their meditations that when their meeting ended, they knew not whether it was day or night. Then Rabbi Abba spake and said: \"Whilst we are all present, let each one direct and concentrate his th oughts and speak on the subject of 'Wisdom,' that our host may be blessed and profited now that he is about to ce lebrate the feast of the circumcision.\" Then stood up one of the guests and said: \"It is wr itten, 'Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and c ausest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts . We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy ho use, thy holy tabernacle' (Ps. LXV. 5). Observe in this verse the sequence of the words, court, house, tabernacle, i n an ascending grade from the lower to the higher. To dwell in thy courts, is to dwell in Jerusalem and be accounted holy, as it is"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"written, 'He that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be c alled holy' (Is. IV. 3), and also, 'We shall be sat isfied with the goodness of thy house.: 'Through wisdom a house is builded and by understanding it is established' (Pr ov. XXIV. 3). By the word wisdom, allusion is made to the occult words, 'And a river went forth out of Eden to water the garden.' 'Thy holy tabernacle,' then, is the higher and supr eme degree of divine life, for the term \"hecal\" (ta bernacle) is the same as he-cal (there is everything), the tabernacl e being the perfection and union of all things. The beginning of the verse confirms this interpretation. 'Happy is the m an whom thou choosest that he may dwell in thy cour ts.' He who offers as a sacrifice to the Holy One his own son b y causing him to undergo the rite of circumcision, becomes a friend and servant of the Holy One and enables him to dwell also in the house and tabernacle or the se cret place of the Most High. The word \"hatzerekha\" (thy courts) i s here found in the plural and includes house and t abernacle. It is for this reason that true men and faithful serva nts of the covenant, when the rite was performed, w ere accustomed to recite this verse in the following way, one of t he assistants repeated the words, 'blessed is he wh om thou choosest to approach unto thee.' Another said, 'we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house.' Then followed the benediction pronounced by the chi ld's p. 385 father: \"Blessed be thou, Lord and Master of the un iverse who hast sanctified us and commanded us to b ring this child unto the covenant of Abraham our father.\" The witnesses then say, 'God grant that as you have ca used thy child to enter into the covenant, so may thou also initiate him into the secret doctrine respecting ma rriage and good works.' We know from tradition that a man ought fir st of all to pray for mercies to be extended to him self and then to others, as it is written, 'Make atonement for hi mself and for his household and for all the congreg ation of Israel' (Lev. XVI. 17). We think this a precept that should be always followed.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"Truly and rightly so, and he who neglects and ignores it excludes himself and enters not into the ten canopies or pavilions which the Holy One has pr epared for the righteous in the world to come and f or all who obey this injunction. For this reason the words of this verse are ten in number, corresponding each of them to one of these pavilions. Blessed is your lot in this world and the world to come, for the secret doctrine is w ritten in your hearts as though you had been in bodily form at Mou nt Sinai when the law was given forth to the childr en of Israel. Said another guest: \"It is written, 'An altar of ea rth shalt thou make unto me and sacrifice thereon t hy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings' (Ex. XX. 24). We are taugh t that everyone who brings his child as a sacrifice , or in other words, causes him to be circumcised, makes an offer ing the greatest and most acceptable that can be re ndered to the Holy One, and also the altar he makes is the most p erfect that can be possibly made. Therefore, at the performance of this rite it is necessary that there be an altar consisting of a vase filled with earth, into which is cast the prepuce, this being accounted by the Holy One as an offering equally as agreeable and acceptable to him as the sacrifice of sheep and oxen, and therefore it is further written , 'Where I record my name, I will come unto thee an d will bless thee.' What do the words, 'where I record my name' signify? They allude to the sign of the covenant, a s it is written, 'The secret or mystery of the Lord is with them tha t fear him, and he will show them his covenant' (Ps . XXV. 14). Further it is added, 'If thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt build it of unhewn stones, fo r if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it' (Ex. XX. 25). These words refer to heathen converts to p. 386 [paragraph continues] Judaism who are generally stiff-necked and hard of heart,95a and therefore termed an altar of stone. 'Thou shalt built it of unhewn stones' signi fy those who have the desire to serve and worship t he Holy One, who enjoins that no gentile convert should undergo the rite of the covenant until he has renounced his former religion and parted with his hardness of heart, as his conversion would prove vain and of no good effe ct. He would be like unto a stone, carved and polished outside b ut interiorly is still rough and hard. The real mea ning then of these words is, unless the heart is softened by entering into the covenant, it is of no benefit whatever, ei ther to them who take part in the ceremony or bear the sign on them. Happy is he who in this pleases the Holy One by th is offering of his son unto him, for he will rejoice daily, as it is written, 'But let them rejoice, all they who put their trust in thee, let hem shout for joy because thou dwellest with them, let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee' \" (Ps. V. 11). Said another guest: \"It is written, 'And Abraham wa s ninety and nine years old and the Lord appeared u nto him, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God, walk thou bef ore me and be thou perfect' (Gen. XVII. 1). This ve rse needs critical examination, as it abounds with several di fficulties that require explanation. It may be aske d, had not the Holy One appeared unto Abraham before attaining unt o this age, which might be inferred from the words of this verse. In previous accounts of the divine manifesta tions no mention whatever is made of Abraham's age. It is simply said, 'the Lord said unto Abraham * * *.' Another d ifficult question is, how was it that before Abraha m had reached this age, scripture nowhere states that the Lord ap peared unto him? It was because that up to that tim e he was uncircumcised, and it was only after he had perform ed the rite the Holy One revealed himself in a way and manner he had never done before, and therefore scripture s tates, 'And the Lord appeared unto him.' But why di d the Lord appear and manifest himself to Abraham on this part icular occasion? Because he wished to make known un to him"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the relation existing between the sign of the coven ant and that most sublime degree of elevation in th e divine life, termed the \"Holy Crown.\" Moreover, the Holy One int ended that from Abraham should proceed a people and nation wholly sanctified unto himself; it was essential th at he himself should first become p. 387 such, which did not occur until he had attained to the age of ninety-nine years. Another reason why sc ripture states this age of Abraham is, that until he had attained thereunto, his years were not reckoned or taken any account of and only began to be so when he became circumcised at t his advanced age. When the Lord appeared unto him a nd said, 'I am the Almighty God' (El Shaddai). Why up to thi s time had he not appeared unto him and announced h imself by this name? Respecting this question tradition infor ms us that at the creation of the world, he. made h igher and lower spheres, some of the latter of which were void of h oliness and spiritual life, such as the world of el ementals who are able to influence those in this earth who are uncir cumcised and who become impressed with their mark, the letters S and D denoting they are soiled and subject to the i nfluence of the evil one. But as soon as men are ci rcumcised, they become freed from the influence of the elementals a nd live under the wings or protection of the Scheki na. It is then that the Yod (I), symbol of the sign of the Covenan t, becomes impressed upon them95a-95b and they bear on them the full-divine name Shaddai (S D I). When this occ urred in the case of Abraham, then, as stated, the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty God, ' (El Shaddai) 'walk thou before me and be thou per fect' (thanaim), which word signifies full and complete. In other words, he said, until now the mark thou ha st borne is incomplete, being composed only of the letters S an d D. Circumcise now thyself, then wilt thou bear my full and complete name of Shaddai, for whoever bears it is b lessed, as it is written, 'And God Almighty (Al Sha ddai) bless thee' (Gen. XXVIII. 3). It is from him that all ble ssings come. He it is who rules the inferior worlds that tremble and fear before him, so that they are unable to exercis e any influence over those who bear on them the ful l sign of the covenant. who will never descend or fall into Gehen na, as it is written, 'Thy people also shall be all righteous'\" (Is. LX. 21). Next: Chapter XCIX. A Feast of Circumcision (Contin ued) p. 388 95b A FEAST OF CIRCUMCISION (Continued) WHAT is truly so, but what tradition teaches us res pecting this, is, when the yod (I) is united with t eeth (H) they form a celestial river, as it is written, \"And a ri ver went out of Eden to water the garden.'Gen 2:10 Let no one, however, object and say, 'when they are united,' as though it was something impossible and absurd; for they most certainly become so, and after this manner scriptur e uses the expression 'ben horin,' and such also is the meaning of the words, 'blessed the land whose king is a \"ben h orin,\" and whose princes eat in due season (with de light and thankfulness).' The preceding verse runs thus, 'Woe to the land whose king is a child,' referred to th e world below, for we learn by tradition that all lands inhabited by idolatrous nations and people are under the rule of great chiefs who themselves are governed and controlled by one t o whom scripture refers, as saying, 'I was a child, and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken' (P s. XXXVII. 25). These are the words of the prince o f this world, who terms himself a child (naar). 'Woe unto the wor ld when it is sustained and ruled by him. When Isra el is in captivity and exile, then is he as one who derives his food and nourishment from a foreign land not hi s own.' 'Whose princes eat in due season' for they eat only in the morning and evening, when tradition informs us jud gment prevails in the world, at the rising and setting of the sun, by whose worship gentile idolators offend and exci te the anger of the Holy One. The evils and afflictions that befall the world are therefore owing to the prevalent swa y and rule over the earth of the evil one, who is here termed a chi ld (naar). Blessed are all ye that are present on t his occasion, for ye are fellow citizens with the saints and children of the Holy King and are nourished not with worldly f ood, but with the bread of heaven; and of you it is written, p. 389 [paragraph continues] 'ye are all joined unto the Lord and are found ali ve unto this day'.\" (Deuter. IV. 4.) Then spake and said Rabbi Abba, at the close of the ceremony: \"It is written, 'now will I sing to my w ell beloved, a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My belove d hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill (qeren be n shamen) and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof an d planted it with the choicest vines' (Is. V. 1). T hese words have a deeply esoteric meaning and therefore demand most t houghtful consideration on account of the difficult ies95b-96a arising in the exposition of them. The first is why is the word song (sherath) here found instead of t he term (reproof). Why also is it said, 'to my well beloved,' (lebidi) instead of 'to my friend?' Again, what is the mean ing of the expression 'my well beloved had a vineyard in a ver y fruitful hill' or, as it should be rendered, a vi neyard in Qeren ben Shamen? We have studied long the secret doctrin e and have failed to find any mention of a place or locality so called."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"\"Many and various excellent explanations have been given by esoteric students who have interpreted thi s verse, as follows: 'I will sing to my well beloved,' refer to the patriarch Isaac, called and known as \"well bel oved\" before his entry into earth life, because he was greatly belov ed by the Holy One and was not born until after Abr aham had entered into the divine covenant and attained to th at degree of initiation in divine life and science symbolized by the letter A, indicative of full adeptship. This degree was also imparted to Sarah, and is typified by thi s letter being added to her name and that of Abram. The addition o f this letter may be further elucidated and explain ed thus: A is the symbol of the female principle; this being so, it may be asked, why was it added to the name of Abram instead of the letter Yod (I), the symbol of the male principl e. The explanation involves a great mystery. Abraha m attained to the highest degree of initiation, symbolized as we have just stated by the first letter in the divine name, I H V H, that has its polarity in the last or lower letter (H). T he first being symbol of the male, the last, of the female. It is written, 'and he said unto them,' 'so (Coh) shall thy seed b e,' referring to the p. 390 multiplication of his posterity who should attain t o the same96a degree of divine life and science as himself. Hence it is that every gentile that enters into the Coven ant is called ger zedek (a true proselyte) and beco mes a son or child of Abraham. Therefore, said God unto him, 'so shall thy seed be,' or in other words, all gentiles who enter into the Covenant shall be of thee and called by thy name. \"This, then, was why the letter H was added to the name ' Abram. Had Sarah only attained this H or deg ree, the posterity of Abram would then have been only childr en of the lower degree of divine life and knowledge or merely proselytes, here designated by the name of Coh. Owi ng, however, to the addition of the higher H symbol izing the divine life, to Abram, and the lower H to the name of Sara, it became possible to engender and bring f orth offspring who would be able to attain to the same degree of i nitiation in divine life as their ancestors, Abraha m and Sarah. The union of the two H's produced the yod or I, the fir st letter in the name of Isaac (yitzchak) emblem of the male principle, which from the time of his birth, began to increase upon the earth; that is to say, from th e time of the birth of Isaac, men began to be born and come into the wo rld who lived the higher and diviner life, and ther efore it is written, 'for in Isaac shall thy seed be called' (G en. XXI. 12). Isaac in his turn begat offspring sus ceptible of attaining to the life symbolized by the higher H, as it is wr itten, 'thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob' (Mich . VII. 20), and Jacob was the highest manifestation of what it does and can accomplish in man, If, however, it be obje cted: was not this exhibited more so in the life of Abraham than on any of his posterity, as it is stated of him, 't hou gayest grace to Abraham?' (Micha-ibid); in reply we say that Abraha m exercised mercy to men. It was, however, Isaac wh o contributed most to the sanctification of humanity, for Abraham was far advanced in life, being ninety and nine years old when he entered into covenant with the Ho ly One, the mystical meaning of which is known to a nd understood by students of the secret doctrine and i ts occult teachings. Next: Chapter C p. 391 96a AT the birth of Isaac, justice became united to mer cy; these divine attributes, symbolized by the patr iarchs Isaac and Abraham, became blended in the person of Jacob, the ir offspring; and, therefore, it is written, 'Thou art my servant, oh Israel, in which I will be glorified' (Is. XLIX. 3). \"Notwithstanding what has just been stated, we can divine why scriptures uses the word song (sherath), and 'I will sing to my well beloved.' These words refer to Isaa c, who was so called before his birth in the world. Another interpretation applies them to Abraham, as it is wr itten, 'What doth my beloved in my house' (Jer. XI. 15). Now it is true, Abraham acquired by merit what his posterity afterwards inherited and enjoyed. The words 'the so ng of my beloved for his vineyard,' refer to the Holy One wh o is called 'beloved,' as it is written, 'My belove d (dodi) is white and ruddy (Cant. V.10). We observe the terms ledidi (well beloved) and dodi (my beloved or friend) are joined together, and from their union of the male and fema le principle comes forth a vineyard planted in Qere n ben Shamen, which appellation, indicates its origin and nature. Qeren has here the same meaning as in the words, 'And it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the Qeren Hayyabel (the horn p. 392 of Jubilee)' (Josh. VI. 5). Thus the vineyard has f or its96a-96b origin the Jubilee or the deliverance , and this horn or trumpet of deliverance is associated with the male principle, termed here ('Ben Shamen,' which has the same meaning as the term 'ben horin' (son of nobles) (Ec cles. X. 7). It also means 'son of the oil,' becaus e of the source whence the oil flows, for supplying all the heavenl y lamps whose light becomes more intense in proport ion to its abundance. Furthermore, at the coronation of kings, this oil is poured into a horn, called the horn of Jubilee, and for this reason no one is crowned except he is first an ointed with oil from this horn. On account of this the reign of David was of long duration."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\"It is further added, 'And he fenced it (vajatzqcho u) with a fence like a ring on the finger.' The wor ds, 'and gathered out the stones thereof,' denote that he separated i t and so arranged that it should not be under the r ule and government of the spiritual chiefs that hold author ity over idolatrous nations; and, having freed and delivered it from evil demoniacal influences and force, he chose this vineyard for his own possession, as it is written, 'He chose his people for his portion, and took Jacob for his inhe ritance' (Deuter. XXXII. 9) . 'And he planted it wi th the choicest vine.' 'Which words have the same meaning as the ve rse, 'I have planted thee a choice (soreq) vine, wh olly (couloh) a right seed' (Jer. II. 21). The word couloh is her e written with a final H, symbol of the grade on th e divine life to which Abraham attained and then gave rise to offspr ing to whom was imparted divine truth which made th em righteous. The words, 'Thus (coh) shall thy seed be ,' have the same esoteric meaning. Blessed is the l ot of Israel who possess such a holy inheritance. \"The second part of the verse is, 'And he built a t ower in the midst of it.' What is here the mystical meaning of the word tower? It is the same as that of the words, 'T he name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteou s runneth, into it and is safe' (Prov. XVIII. 9). It is further add ed, 'and also made a wine-press therein,' referring to the gate of the Just, as it is written, 'Open unto me the gates of righteousness' (Ps. CXVIII. 19). How know we that a t the time of circumcision p. 393 every Israelite enters into the tower of the Just a nd the gates of righteousness? Or how know we that whoever offers his son as a sacrifice, that is, causes him to unde rgo the rite of the covenant, initiates him into th e mystery of the sacred name on which heaven and earth are both foun ded? We are assured of it from the words, 'Thus sai th the Lord, if my covenant had not been made with day and night , I should not have prescribed the laws that govern heaven and earth' (Jer. XXXIII. 25). Blessed is the master of this house, who by his obedience to the law and rit e of the covenant has enjoyed the presence of the Holy One this day. Blessed also are we who have been present on this occasion as witnesses of it. To this child, I shall apply the w ords of scripture, 'Everyone that is called by my n ame, I have created him for my glory. I have formed him, yea, I have made him' (Is. XLIII. 3), and also the verse, 'And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great sha ll be the peace of thy children' (Is. LIV. 13). Next: Chapter CI. Rabbi Abba's Punishment RABBI ABBA'S PUNISHMENT As Rabbi Abba returned homewards, the guests along with the host accompanied him three leagues on his way. Said they unto him: \"Truly our host has been blesse d by the good deed he has done.\" Then said Rabbi Abba: \"What may that good deed be?\" Then replied the host: \"She whom I took for my spou se was the wife of my brother who died childless, a nd in obedience to the injunction of the law I married he r and the child of our union I have named after my deceased brother.\" Said Rabbi Abba: \"Henceforth from this day let him be called Ydi. The boy grew up to manhood and becam e afterwards famed for his learning and known as Doct or Ydi, the son of Jacob.\" In bidding adieu to the hosts and guests, Rabbi Abb a gave them all his benediction and then proceeded on his way homewards. On his arrival, he gave an account of al l he had heard and learned to Rabbi Eleazar, who he sitated and p. 394 feared to inform his father of what had occurred at this feast of circumcision.96b One day Rabbi Abba was sitting in The presence of R abbi Simon, who asked him the question: \"What is th e meaning of the words, \"And Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him, saying: 'As for me, my co venant is with thee'? From these words we learn that whilst A braham was uncircumcised it was incumbent he should bow his face earthwards. Only after he had entered into the covenant and performed the rite attached to it, wa s he able to stand erect without a feeling of fear or dread. The words, 'my covenant will I make with thee' refer t o the time when it was completed.\" Then said Rabbi Abba: \"With the permission of my ma ster, I will relate to him the many excellent disco urses and wonderful things I have heard and witnessed.\" Said Rabbi Simon: \"Speak on:\" Then Rabbi Abba spake and said: \"I am greatly afrai d that I have caused others to suffer.\" \"God forbid that it should be so!\" exclaimed Rabbi Simeon, \"for it is written, 'He shall not be afraid of evil tidings' (Ps. CXII. 7). Then related Rabbi Abba to him all that had been sa id and witnessed during the feast of circumcision. After a few moments' reflection, Rabbi Simeon said: \"How is it that having listened to such excellent discourses, thou hast not mentioned them, but kept them to thys elf? For so doing, thou shalt not for thirty days e xperience and"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"find profit nor benefit in thy hours of meditation on what thou hast learned and witnessed. Is it not written, 'Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, whe n it is in the power of thy hand to do it'?\" (Prov. III. 27). This was the injunction Rabbi Abba had to endure. Moreov er, Rabbi Simeon said: \"I order that what thou hast learned and witnessed be made known to the student novitiat es at Babylon , so that they may not act as thou hast acted, in keeping good things to thyself, and speaking on occ ult subjects that should never be divulged or impar ted to any save to students of the Secret Doctrine.\" p. 395 Rabbi Simeon was greatly distressed and pained beca use thou hast revealed occult teachings.96b \"That is true which thou sayest,\" replied Rabbi Abb a, \"I grieve and fear lest the students at Babylon may be tempted by my example, and act imprudently as I have done.\" Said Rabbi Simeon: \"God forbid they should suffer f or divulging the mysteries of the secret doctrine, which should always be jealously guarded and kept secret by novi tiates, and never be subjects of discourse save amo ngst ourselves. This the Holy One furnish them to do, an d therefore it is, only amongst ourselves they shou ld be made known and taught.\" Said Rabbi Jose: \"It is written, 'Then shall thy li ght break forth as the morning' (Is. LVIII. 8). The time will come when the Holy One shall say to every human soul, 'T hy light shall break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord be round about thee.'\" END OF SECTION LEKH LEKHA Peace to all beings.
