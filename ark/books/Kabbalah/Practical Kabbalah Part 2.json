Va ughan I. – THEURGY “A mag ical Power, pu t to sleep by th e Fa ll, is la ten t in Ma n. It can be reaw akene d by the Grac e of GOD, or by t he Art of KABBALA... ” (J.-B . Van Hal mont: “Hort us Med icin æ – Leyd e 166 7). 1. – DEFI NITI ON Theurgy (from the Greek theos : God, and ergon : work), is the highest, the most pure and also the most wise as pect of that whic h the vulgar call Magic. To begin with the latter, then to only keep the essen ce and m ost refined purity, is to arrive at the form er. According to Charles B arlet, “Ceremonial Magic is an operation by which Man seeks to constrain – by m eans of the very play of Natural Forces – the Invisible Powers of various Ord ers to act in accordan ce with what h e requires of them . To t his end, he seizes them , surprises them , that is to say through projection (by means of analogical “correspondences” which com prise the Unity of Creation); these Powers over which he is not m aster, but to which he can open extraordin ary pathways, to the very heart of Nature. To this end he uses Pentacles, special Substa nces, rigorous conditions of Tim e and Pl ace, which he must observe under pain of the gravest of perils. F or, if the path sought is even a little los t, the audaciou s one will b e exposed to the force of these “Powers” before which he is but a speck of dust...” (Charles Ba rlet: l’Initia tion , January 1897 edition). Thus we can see that Magic is but transcendental Physics . From this definition of Theurgy there is but one practical applicati on: that of the Law of Analogous Correspondence, com prising: 1. The Unity o f the W orld in all its par ts; 2. The Analogous Identity of the Divine Plan e and the Material Universe, the second being created “in the image” of the first and rem aining its reflection, inferior and im perf ect; 3. An enduring rapport between the tw o, a rapport flowing from this analogous identity, being able to be expressed at the sam e tim e as it is e stablished, b y a secondary science, called Sym bolism. Regarding the “dom ain” in which these sec ondary principles are going to be utilized, Theurgy cleanly separates itself from Magic. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan The latter only puts Natural Fo rces into action, be they te rrestrial or cosm ic, and only operates in the purely m aterial dom ain which is the Universe and, in consequence not even at the level of the S econdary Causes, and at the very m ost at the level of the “interm ediaries” or “Tertiar y Causes”. In consequence the action of the Magician disturbs the process of the Secondary Caus es, who can only express themselves by m eans of the Prim ary Cause, being m otivated by one of His “potentialities”. Out of this comes the inev itab le re- estab lishm ent of the broken equilibrium , called the “shock of return”, which follows all m agical results: the violen ce of this contrary e ffect being proportional to the size and duration of the results obtained. For this is a n im prescrip tible law: th at the Magician must pay in sorrow for the joys wh ich his Art has dragged from the “Eternal Im ages” issued from the ABSOLUTE, then oriented and fixed by the Secondary Causes. Everything else is the dom ain of Theurgy and the factors which it puts in play, purely metaphysical factors besides, and in conseque nce never cosm ic or hyperphysical. For it is in th e ver y heart of th e Archetype, in the “po ssibilities” wh ich pass – a s fugitive im ages – in the PRIMORDIAL INTELLIGENCE, that Theurgist works. Let us therefore define this dom ain. * * * The Theurgist neces sarily believ es in the existence of a single BEING, Uni que, Eternal, Omnipotent, Infinitely W ise, Infi nitely Good, Source and Conservator of all em anated Beings and of all trans ient Beings . This Unique BEING is called m any na mes by him , each express ing but one of the “Ray s” o f His Glory, and which here we will sim ply call: GOD. Because GOD in Hi mself is infinite in pow er and possibilities, Good and Evil coexist and are eternally in balance. But, because He is also infinitely W ise, and Absolute Good, envisaging all eternity in His Om niscience, all the possible outcom es, he operates am ong them eternally, and through His Om nisapience, a Discrim ination that is als o etern al. T his etern al Discrim ination thus consti tutes Good and Evil, face to face. That, which GOD ad mits, retains, welcom es, realizes and preserve s, constitutes the Ideal, or Archetypal Universe. This is the “W orld Above”, or Heaven. T hat which He refutes, reje cts, rep roves and wishes to eff ace, constitu tes the “W orld Beneath”, o r Hell. And now we understand that Hell is eterna l, as is the Evil which it expresses. As God is eternal, and as He contains within Himself all “ possibilities”, E vil is eternal and He cannot destroy it. And as He is infinitely Good, He does not wish it to endure. And so, since He is also Infinitely Wise, God transforms it into Good... But, since E vil is also eternal, at leas t in “p rinciple”, eter nal too is this Work of the Redem ption of rejected elem ents, just as the Good which it m anifest and realizes is eternal too. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan Man, like all creatures, carries within him self a Divine sp ark, without which he would not know how to exist. This spark is LIFE its elf. This Divine “Fir e” carries within itself all possibilities, like the ORIG INAL FIRE from which it em anates. Goo d as well as evil. For he is only its reflection; and there is no difference in nature be tween the brazier and the spark ! This “fire”, then, is able to “reflect” G ood or “reflect” Evil. When Man tries to approach G OD, he fans and anim ates the “clear fire” within him self, the Divine fire, the “ fire of jo y ”. W hen he tends to distance him self from GOD, he fans and illum inates in him self the “som ber fire”, the infern al fire, the “ fire of wrath ”. Thus, he generates in him self, just as GOD do es in the great ALL, Go od or Evil, Heaven or Hell. And it is within ours elves th at we carry the root of our sorrows or our joys. It is to this Work of Uni versal Re demption and Communion, which m akes Man an auxiliary to GOD, that Th eurgy invites the Adept. Perhaps he will not achieve vis ible m iracles , an d perhaps he will be forever ignorant of the Good, which he will h ave realized. But in this very ign oran ce, h is work will be one hundred tim es greater than that of the black m agician, even if the la tter accomplishes the most astonishing spells . For these latter types will only exp ress the reality of archetyp al Evil and c ollabo rate with it. Nobody can doubt the real ity of this Evil, and collabor ation with it is truly of no use... Magic show s us that no thing is lo st, and that all com es back to take its p lace once more. “Each shall sow that which he shall r eap, and reap that which he sows”, Scripture tells us. The Black m agician, at heart, is an ignor ant m an who plays the gam e of the fool! His desires or his hates pois on his days, and represent lost tim e for true Knowledge. In the twilig ht of his lif e, he will ge t the poi nt. N eithe r Love nor Fortune nor Youth nor Beauty will be at his bed side to justif y his wasted Hours. There will only rem ain one thing: a debt to pay, in this life or in another, and no creatu re on God’s earth will be able to pay it for him . For, in desiring to m old such powerful a nd unknown “Forces”, as m ysterious as they are redoubtable, to his fleeting fantasies, he will perhaps become their unconscious slave, but never th eir master ! ... Withou t kn owing it, he will have b ecome their s ervant ... “When we lie and defraud”, said Mephistophe les, “we give what is ours!” In the voice of Goethe, it is that anonym ous crowd of Initiates th rough all ages which warns us! 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan * * * Those “principles” which GOD preserved, since He desired them throughout all etern ity, were emanated by Hi m. They then individualized them selves, and then expressed th em selves in turn ac cording to the ir p roper na ture which is th e Origina l Divine Idea. The totality of these “em anations ” constitute th e Divine Plane or Aziluth. Each of them is a Metaphysical Attribute. There are thus: “Justice”, “Severity”, “Mercy ”, “Mildnes s”, “Strength ”, “W isdom ”, et c. As they are of the Divin e Essence, o ne may conc lude that oriental m etaphysical philosophers, having nam ed the m, then added th e endings “E l” or “Yah” which signif ied GOD in the m asculine or fe minine. From this one obtains these conventional denom inations: “Justice-of -God”, “Strength-of-G od”, “Mercy -of-God”, etc... Each of thes e Em anations, as they are them selves constituen ts of the ONE- DIVINITY, em anate in their turn secondary m odalities of their own essence. And so on. Thus are created those particular beings which we call Angels, Geniuses or Gods, beings which Theodicy has grouped into ten conventional divisions. These are the nine angelic choirs, to which are added the “glorified bodies” of Judeo-Christian Theology and the Kab balah. In the “W orld Below” which GOD rejects (t he Qlippoth, or “shells” of the Kabbalah), each of them has its an tithes is, an absolute ly op posed being, em anated by one of the Contrary-Attributes, and which GOD wishes to evolve towards the Best and the Good. There are th erefore “Injustice”, “W eakness” , “Cruelty”, “Hardness” and “Error”, and by adding com plem enta ry endings, -El or -Ya h, one obtains the De moniacal Nam es: “Suprem e-Injustice”, “S uprem e-Weakness”, “Su prem e-Cruelty”, etc... * * * All the “potentialities” rejected “below” ar e destined to becom e “living beings” and, em erging from the Abyss through th e Grace and L ove of GOD, they then constitute the World of Proofs and Necessit y, the “Earth”, in Hebrew Aretz , the only higher reflection of this Abyss. For all the B eings who, in all eternity, are not “God-Attributes ” of the ABSOLUTE, are born in the Abyss, together with those whom the Eterna l W isdom f orever r ejec ts, it appears that, these Being s from the Lower W orld must all finally com e “Above”, to reach the “Palace of the King”, attach ed to one of the Ten Spheres m entioned earlier, bu t im proved, evolved, finally becom ing what GOD eter nally desires, and rich in the totality of their m emories and their pas t exp erien ces. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Arriving at this last estate, a crossroads where they aw ait m oral Liberty and Responsibility, they then constitute the W orld of Proofs and Fatality, whic h is “Ear th”, precurso r to the sym bolic “Heavens”. By virtue of this Liberty a nd this Choice, and since they find them selves on the plane of Aretz (“earth”), submitted to Experience , and so to Suffering and transf orm ing Death, Men m ay, through their acceptan ce or refusal, their intelligent or unreason able cho ice, clim b or descend the Ladder, the ladder of “becom ing”. One will note that the Ka bbalah giv es the sam e num erical valu e to the wor d Sinaï as the word Sulam , signifying ladder (130). Here, Ge matria shows us one of the principle keys of Kabbalistic m etaphysics. In fact, this “ladder” is linked to the legend of the patriarch Jacob, a word signifying “ he who supplants ”. For one soul it is a place to climb, for another to descend. (see in the “Mabinogion” or “Stories for the Disciple”, Bardic teach ings on th is subject, in the te lling of Peredur ab Ewrach). Also, on the Eternal W heel, all souls succes sively pass through all states (see the Shaar HaGilgulim, \"The Gates of Reincarnation,\" of Rabbi Isaac Lu ria). In this clim bing of the ladder, one soul is the “supplanter” wh ile another is the step... For, arriving a first tim e at the “Celes tial Palace”, the world of Plenitude, where he finally r edis covers th e to tality of his m emories a nd f acultie s, the Being c an re-d escen d voluntarily on “Earth”, on Aretz, and be reincarnated there, eithe r with the objec tive of obtaining the new experiences and benefits that flow from this, or with th e altruis tic intention of helping other beings to liberat e them selves from the Abyss, and to leav e Sheol (“the Sepulcher”). And to do this as m any tim es as they desire, protected by Forgetfulnes s. – Can we imagine th e mental hell , which Life would be if we could rem ember everything we had been before? Imagine, fo r exam ple, our immortal self having been a spider? W e would see o urselves, a s pider sp inning a carpet in an infected hole, dancing upon a canvas, receptacle of every pus or sp eck of dust, and chewing upon the cadavers of decom posing flies with our open m andibles? “Forgetfulness of prior lives is a blessing of GOD ...” the tradition of the Lam as tells us! And because Divine Eternity and Infin ity ensure that the ABSOLUTE rem ains forever inaccessib le to B eings, even when they com e to the “ Palace of th e Heavens”, eternal in duration, infinite in possibilities ; such are the “experien ces” of the Creature, and so Divine W isdom and Love allo w it to pa rtic ipate in a relative eternity and infinity, which are im ages and reflections of the Divine etern ity and inf inity, and , in the s ame way, generators of an eternal becom ing . * * * 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Va ughan In any case one is unable to confuse Beings in the course of evolution towards the Divine Plane with the attribut es of the Divine, which are th e constitutive parts of GOD. And it is by the om nipotence of the Wor d, expressed through Prayer and Holy Orisons, through a life approachi ng – so far as it is given to Man – its own perfection, that the The urgist awakens and puts into action the Divine Attributes, by raising himself up to them... And it is through Symbolism that he is able to cha nnel and conduct this activity, by “placing” him self in Ti me and Spac e, that th e T heurgis t the n acts indir ectly on the Being and m aterial Universe. For, origin ating in th e un iversa l in itia tic p rinciple that the “part” is a reflection of the “Whole”, and “that which is below is as that whic h is above”, this Sym bolism allows him to rea lize a true microcosm through analogous identity with the Macrocosm . This theory can be found, in degraded for m, in the prin ciple of Magical Spe lls and of creating a “power battery”. Through Symbolism the Theurgist realizes upon his Alta r, on his Pentacles, or in his operative Circles, the true “bat ter ies” of the Celes tial W orld, of the m aterial Universe, of the Beings who reside there, and th e Powers who are th erein contain ed. But, contrary to the practice of vulgar Magic, wh ich is rea lly linked to the particula r virtues of his objects, to hi s ingredients, and to the ri tes (which have now becom e superstitious formulae ) o f his Sacramentary – like the Physic ian or Chem ist at h is laboratory apparatus, to the chem ical used and to the form ulae in his m anual, the Theurgist does not possess this superstitious servitude . He only uses Sym bolism as a means of expression, complem entary to his word , itself expressive of his thought . For Symbolism (in the realm of inanimate things) completes the Gesture of the Theurgist, and his Gesture completes his Word, his Word expresses his T hought, and his Thought expresses his Soul . And this is truly the secret of the “Fertile Marriage between Heaven and Earth”. So in the Divine Trin ity and Hum an Trinity: ONE-GOD ONE-SOUL Father Thought Son W ord Holy Spirit Action Finally, the Theurgis t does not pretend to make submit , but to obtain : and this is very different!

T hen, there is no m ore Magic ... * * * For the Theurgist, no “explanation” to dim inish his powers need be feared, since at the very first m oment he discards all m ateri al factors endowed with an occult virtue, all powers contained or infused through the rites in his m aterial props. Sym bolism alone can unite him with the Divine, with the transport of his soul as his vehicle. From the start he poses the problem : how to address him self to GOD through the channel of Spirit an d Heart , and so no defloration of the great arcane need be feared, and, whatever m ay befall him in his various realizations, the Myster y of these latter v ehicles rem ains intact.

Va ughan A belief in the inf erio rity of the f eminine sou l in com parison to the m asculine sou l, derives f rom trad ition al Symbolism , key and rule of Theurgy itself. In fact, W oman represents by analogy the Virgin Mother, or E ternal-Nature, naturata as naturanda . Man him self expresses above all the im age of the Logos, the W ord, Creator, em anator and im pregnator of this sam e Nature. As the Virgin Mother is equal to the Son and to the Father in the Divine T rinity, Woman is the spiritual equal of Man. But, just as Na ture lives in subm ission to the Creator, so Wom an is corporeally inferior to Man. Let us add as well that her m enstrual im pur ity, which risks all, and which in olden tim es would have soiled the floor of Orator ies or Occultum s (due to the almost tota l absence of undergarm ents), and which for se veral days of the month also m ade the female body a condenser of purely magical fluids, by reason of this very rhythm , repres ents th e lunary elem ent of the Hum an Couple. W oman is in fact and because of this role analogous to Night, S ilence and Water; just as Man is the solar elem ent of the said Couple, analogous to Day, Light, the W ord and Fire. And the popular saying that: “sad is the pou lterer when the hen sings and the cock rem ains sile nt...” seem s to te ll us of the im portan ce of the m asculin e W ord, reserv ing to the wom an t he role of the fecund yet passive support of this creative word 2 . B. Requ ired Knowledge He who wishes to beco me a Theurgist m ust possess a general educa tion at le ast a t th e level of a Bachelor of Arts. The works of the ancient au thors are not at all clear, and therefore a basic understanding of Latin; Greek and above all Hebrew are indicated! Let us add a fair knowledge of classical philo sophy, m etaphysics and even theology, and we will have satisfied the ex igenci es of regularly req uired knowledge. But th is will no t b e all, s ince the Theurgis t o f old was a savant, a priest and a m age as well... In the dom ain of her metic knowledge, it is the sam e. One should have read the ancient classics (Cornelius Agrippa, Par acelsus, Robert Fludd, Henry Khunrath, Jakob Boehm e, etc); have a solid understanding of Astrology, both judicial and Kabbalistic; knowledge of the general laws, principles and vocabulary of Alchem y; and know the basic laws and applications of Magic. Fi nally, and above all, one m ust be acquainted with the Kabbalah. Kabbalah is the very foundation of Theurgy . W e don’t wish to say that other spiritual exercises, relying on different custom s though tending towards the sam e end, but deriving from philosophies fore ign to Europe, would not know how to lead one to the sa me result. But in th is wo rk, ai med at Europeans, we only deal with Theurgy which rests on the one hand on a Judaeo-Chris tian docum ent ary and m ystical foundation, and on the other hand on a Celto-m ystical m agic.

In this, we will comm it no perjury, for we are not bound by any obligation, as these thin gs have come to us by m eans of the Theurgic path itself , and they are th e result of our meditations , our Operations , and these a lone – by m eans of Ritual – c onstitu te a tr aditional “d eposit”. Fin ally, it will b e necessary to have some rudiments of Hebrew , and a gramm ar and dictiona ry will b e indispensable. C. Lifestyle It m atters not if one is single or m arried. The essential point in both cases is not to exaggerate the im portance of sexual activity. A perm anent repression of desire, dif ficu lt to sustain in a young person, would be a ball and chain to drag behind one. One the other hand, overly freque nt repetition of the sexual act, and overly exhausting and attractiv e voluptuous “gam es” are each as harmful to the psychic equilibrium as they are to spiritual and m oral elevation. Both repression and exaggeration of the venereal act or its frequency indicate obsession, w hich is com pletely contra ry to the asceticism of Theurgy. It is the same in the dom ain of nutrition. Excess in anything is a fault, and one should observe a co mplete continence and fasti ng (partial or absolu te) during the period preced ing Great Operations. Do not overindu lge in m eat and spices in th e regular diet. Their psychic properties are of ten opposed to certain work. The only dom ain in which no lim it m ay be admitted is that which flows out of reading and m editation. One should focus on tradition al works: the Sepher Yetzirah , the Sepher ha Zohar , and all the classics of the Kabbala h: Kircher, Khnor von Rosenroth, Drach, Luria, etc...(refer to the bibliography of the Kabbalah in the work of Papus entitled “The Qabbalah”).

The windowpane(s) should be covered with a good quali ty paper “stained glass window” effect, whose general shade is yellow , orange or clear red.

Va ughan The floor, of wooden floorboards, flaggi ng, or composite m aterial, should be com pletely covered by a thick pile carpet, un iform, red, hyacinth, navy blue or any other dark shade instead. Many authors use the sam e na me Oratory, or “occultum ”. The sam e type of ideal Oratory for a practitioner of Magic was described in “In th e Shadow of t he Cathedrals 4 ”, pages 20, 21 and 22. The idea of coloring th e ceiling in blue is taken from Masonic tradition, which prefers to do this in its Lodges. The presence of st ained glass was also justified in our work: “In the Shadows of the Cathedrals”, on pages 217 and 218. Finally, an “Occultu m” was described ( under this nam e) in the engr aving on page 23 in R. P. Sabazius’ book: “Spell 5 ”. The trad itional shades prescrib ed f or the decoration of such an Oratory are taken from the text of Exodus (the Tab ernac le ten ts, the Holy-o f-Holies of the Tem ple of Solom on, etc). B. Oratory Fu rniture The furniture is com posed of an Altar, a Ch air, two W ardrobes, a Table, a Lectern, to which can b e added, for certain practices : a pr ie-Dieu, or, better still, a special “prayer ma t”. This last item, it is true, is not m entione d often in herm etic m aterials. Yet for meditations taking the form of adoration, of long duration, it has its advantages. Moreover, the position of the Theurgist, kneeling imm ediately upon it, his gaze on the Oratory, m akes them very particular generators of a m ental state. By m eans of it, the subconscious leads us towards certain states of consciousness, which no other physical position can create. a) The Altar – either a cupboard around 80 – 90 cm. high, or a rectangular table about 1.3 meters by 70 cm. If one decides on a cupboard, this also rem oves the need for one of the two wardrobes. This cupboard th en serves to organize certain regularly used accesso ries: jars of res in, perfum es, coals fo r th e censer, lamp oil, parch ment, etc. The presence of an altar in the Oratory is indicated by the following authors: Cornelius A grippa, Book IV, page 35; Eli phas Lévi, t.1, page 287; Alphonse Gallais, pages 98-99; P. Piobb, page 231, Papus, page 296; R. Am belain, “Cathedrals”, page 67. According to these authors it is m ade of wood a nd often serves as a cupboard to contain accesso ries. b) Prie-Dieu – As we have said, it serves for long prayers of the half-m editational, half-adoring for m. It should be of classic styl e, with a red cushion affixed to it with the aid of four cords or Corde liers a ttach ed to the two upr ights and the two feet, which should be co nveniently p laced.

If not, one should be selected with interior shelves to house the sam e accesso ries as would be placed in the cupboa rd (jars, virgin skins, coals, etc). The presence of one or several wardrobes in a Magical Oratory is indicated by: Pierre Mora, pages 13 and 14; Papus, page 297; Alphonse Gallais, page 98. It is used for the custom ary purpose.   The second, without in terior sh elv ing, should be furnished with hanging sp ace, and a rod sh ould be f ixed inside, with som e coat hangers. T his will h ous e the r itua l clothe s on o ne side, and will se rve as the “c loakr oom ” f or the Operator 7 . To separate these two functions, one ritual and the other profane (and im bued with “souvenirs” which are often im pure and co mmonplace), the wardro be should be divided into two parts b y a vertical partition of wood or lam inate if possible, or at least with hanging m aterial 8 . e) Table – It w ill b e used f or sever al p urposes. Up on it th e The urgist g rinds the arom atic resins, m ixes their respective quant itie s, m akes the inks and the ta lism anic “designs 9 ”, copies the ritual texts, the lectur es, the works for study, etc. Tables of analogical correspondences could be fixed to the wall above this table, taken from the “ Virga Aurea ” or the “ Magical Calendar ” of Duchanteau. f) Lectern – the lectern is a high desk of w ood, intended to support the Theurgic Ritual, also called the “S acram entary ”. It can be m ade at hom e, using the m usic stands of musicians, used by conductors, as a model. It can either be m ade of m etal or wood. However, wood is preferable overall, since one should avoid overly gross m etallic m asses in certain w orks which com e closer to Magi c than pure Theurgy, which is inevitable in certain phases of theurgical training. A lectern or desk, intended to hold th e Sacram entary, appea rs in the an cien t engravings representing m agical Oratories.

By this one rids oneself of inc onvenient com ings and goings, and even just for reading, the Oratory is an excellent room . N.B.: All these pieces of furnitu re should be painted a dark sh ade. If white wood is being used, they should first be tinted with dark walnut stain, then regularly stained and polished. C. Ordinary Accessories These are th e m ost indispensable accessories. 1) Mortar and pestle : to g rind the a romatic res ins, which are n orm ally purchased in tears, into a fine powder. Tears are to be preferred ove r pre-ground resin, in which one risks finding a little of everything. The re sinous tears can be pulverized by firstly crushing them between two zinc or copper plat es under forearm pressure (or desk press). Form this one can get a p ancake of co mpact powder, which one can then process easily with the pe stle to reproc ess it. 2) Silver spoo n : to m ix these resins and to count out the “parts” asked for in the for mulae. 3) A couple of dozen glass carboys , half a lite r capa city, to contain pure res ins, specific m ixtures, and accessories (p ulverized poplar charcoal, saltpeter, etc). A label should be affixed to the jar, w ith the contents written in larg e letters. Do not write too sm all, since it is g ener ally dif ficult to read fine script in the re duced lighting of the Oratory, when one is perfor ming Operations. 4) Parchment . A certain quantity of parchm ent should be kept in reserve, the sheets kept flat. Genuine parchm ent should be used, not artif icial (sulfurized paper). Real parchm ent is m ade from the skin of lam b, s heep, goat or kid. It is used to create the ordinary Pentacles. It can be easily found at parchm ent m akers’ shops. Before being used, in free tim e, one should pum ice the parts which are still rough and trim the sides sm oothly. The use of virgin parchm ent is not new. Pierre Mora, page 18; Papus, pages 312 and 315; and R. Am belain (“Cathedrals”), pages 22 and 276 discuss the subject at length, as well as Alphonse Gallais, page 100 and Agrippa, book IV, page 31. 5) Pens . In order to associate Nature sym bolically with his action, the Theurgist should not use steel or iron nibs. One should use goose feathers, or t hose of doves, turtle- doves, eagles, or other solar anim als (never the feathers of ni ght birds, such as the raven, magpie, etc). One can often find goose-feathe r commercially prepared, already cut, in middle-sized stationers. One m ay al so use a very fine paintbrush. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan One should also have a 45 degree square, a 60 degree one, a protractor, a com pass, pencils and a flat ruler, in or der to pre-draw the schem as. Pierre Mora, on page 21, indicated the use of a raven feather f or talism ans. The ancient use of goose feathers is known! On page 315 of his book, Papus cites the following: “Exorcism of pens....you will wet the end of the feathers ...”. These item s should be put in the draw er of the ordinary Table, and a writing-pad a sm all drawing-board, completes this ensem ble, together with a pen-box, eraser, etc... 6) Inks . In op erative Theu rgy, one can acceptably use comm ercial inks. O nly the color is symbolic, and th e ingred ients enter ing in to th eir com position are only of im portance in the dom ain of pure Magic. Four g ood quality inks will be s ufficient: (China) black, ultram arine blue, red (carm ine or poppy), and green (a good jade color) will be ad equate f or all work. 7) Charcoal . The best are those specially m ade for church censers, and which can be found in shops specializing in liturgical accessories. They light easily from the flame of a candle. If they burn with difficulty, one m ay pass them for a m oment through a warm oven, in order to dry them out without lighting them . The use of charcoal briquettes as used in the Catholic Church, has been indicated since 1937 on page 2176 of our work: “Tre aty on Esoteric Astrology, Volum e 2: Onom ancy”. 8) Perfumes . Sym bology attributes a perfum e to each of the seven orig inal Planets. Bearing th is in m ind, one m ay easily di scover m ultip le co rres pondences with the Septenary, uniting the resins and perfum es with the Macrocosm . These are th e attribu tion s: - Frankincense.....................Sun - Myrrh..............................Moon - Galbanum.........................Mars and Earth - Siam ese Be nzoin.................Jupiter - Sum atran Benzoin...............Mercury - Sandalwood.......................Venus - Storax..............................Saturn They are norm ally only used acco rdin g to well-defined and ex trem ely ancient for mulae.

One can find the planetary correspondences given by us in our book: “ In the Shadow of the Cathedrals ”. Regarding the three formulae: Ros e-Croix In cense , Incense of the Magi and Jerusalem Incense , recreated by us in term s of proportions , they are ou r intellectu al property.

One will always find it useful to ad d pulverized wood carbon and saltpeter to those com position s, which do not indicat e them , in the proportions of 1/8 th carbon and 1/10 saltpeter respectively. These ingredient s facilitate com bustion, preventing the resins from turning into ‘glue’ and extinguishing th e fire. They can be found at drugstores, pharm acists, etc. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A.

An oil of unction will be necessary for cerem onies consecrating ritu al Objec ts, litu rgical Vestm ents, and to perf orm the vario us “Sacram ents of the Or der” which m ight occupy the Theurgist with his follow ers.

This should be stopped with a herm etically sealed lid. Six m onths later the paste should be placed on a fine cloth an d gently p ressed to exp ress the perfum ed Oil, which will be co llected in a s mall bottle. This bottle s hould have a ground stopper. This is th e o il of the Pon tiffs of Israe l, used in the Tem ple of Jerusalem at the ordination of the High Priests, and gi ven to us in Exodus (XXX, 23, 24, 25): – Myrrh dissolved in alcohol...........500 shekels – Pulverized Cinnam on..................250 shekels – Sweet Calam us.........................250 shekels – Cassia....................................500 shekels – Olive Oil.................................a “Hin” The for mula published here is the on e given in a m anuscript from the 18 th Century, form the Arsenal Lib rary , origin ating from the archive Paulm y d’Argenson, and titled: “The Sacred Magic of Abram elin the Mage”.

Liturgica l Objects We denote as being Liturgical Objects thos e in ten ded to “appear” perm anently or at certain phases of the Operations, on the Altar Stone, properly stated. Liturgy is a word derived from the Greek lithos : stone, and ergon : work. Thus litu rgy is wo rk upon the “stone”, or the shaping of the sym bol ic “Stone”... These Objects are for the Theurgy which concerns us here: - Altar cloth, - Altar Ston e, - Lights, including the Candlesticks, Candles and C herubim , - Sanctuary L amp, - Censer and Boat, - Crystal Sph ere, - Great Metallic Pentacle, - Luciferum , or Active Can dle, - Sword, - Pentacles, - Al mond-tree W and. 1) Altar c loth – Of white linen, with a wide lace border in m atching white. T his should be covered with another cloth, of crim son red, over the entire upper surface of th e Altar, a cloth that w ill be trimm ed with gold ed ging. For cerem onies following the rhythm of the planetary W eek, one m ay adopt an upper cloth in the color of the Da y on which one is operating: Sunday: Sun, orange-yellow Monday: Moon, pale blue Tuesday: Mars, bright red Wednesday: Mercury, yellow or silver-gray Thursday: Jupiter, purpose or violet Friday: Venus, jade green Saturday: Saturn, indigo, navy blue, clear brown The use of cloths for m agical altars is attested to by Agrippa, book IV, page 235, by Papus, page 297 and other authors. 2) Altar Stone – One should procure a pure m arble plaque 65 centim eters square by 20 m illim eters thick. One should hav e a Pentag ram engraved on one side and a Hexagram on the other, and then gild these engravings. One side or the other will be used depending on the ritual polarity (see co rrespondences and their diagram s). Eliphas Lévi, indicates the us e of a stone on the m agical altar. Vol. I, pages 267 and 268, see also in our work: “ In the Shadow of the Cathedrals ”, page 257. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan 3) Lights – a) Candlesticks . Generally two will suf fice to b egin with. But so on one will f ind tha t to sym bolize cer tain F orces or Attr ibutes, f our – or even f ive – will be necessary. One could buy all of them at the outset: and very beautiful ones can be f ound in antique stores. b) Candles . The best wa y is to pro cure cand les made of “litu rgical wax” ( stear ine with 40% beeswax) which are intended for the tw o Candlesticks necessarily placed on eithe r sid e of the Crucif ix on a Catho lic Altar, sy mbolizing th e two grea t Archangels, Michael and Gabriel, the two Lum inaries of the S un and Moon, or acco rding to others the two other Persons of the Trinity: Father and Holy Spirit. c) Cherubim . – Intended to represent the “Holy Anim als” or Chayoth-ha-Kodesh of Ezekiel. One can also use Sphinxes, or two figures, one m asculine and the other feminine. One can find bookends or copper fired ogs, which will perfectly fit the situation. In the case of bookends, it is preferable for them to be m ade of wood rather than plaster or agglom erate. d) Seven -branched Candelabra . – A Seven-Branched Ca ndelabra should also be procured, as it f igure s in certain Cere monies, which we will d iscuss later. But it is not generally required. The use of candlesticks or flam beaux with wax candles is referred to by: Agrippa, book IV, pages 35 and 38; Pierre Mora, pa ge 149; by Papus, page 306; and by R. Am belain, in “Treatise of Esoteric Astr ology”, Vol II; “Onom ancy”, page 217, and in “Magical G eom ancy”, page 37. 4) The Sanctuary Lamp . – A La mp as found in the Sanctuary, Chapel or C hurch Choir, with gilded copper or gilded silver feet, with solid ruby-red glass. The lam p from a Mosque is a less attractive proposition, as the glass is green and covered in gold filigre e, and this would modif y the ambience of our Oratory consider ably . The m ystical orientation would be very different. This lam p is norm ally placed, regarding its sym bolis m of fire (Shin), upon the Altar. Its pr actical use resides in the fact that it does not give of f much light, the better to r eveal app aritions, and ab ove all on ce lit, its em its an intensely mystical and religious atm osphere. One should naturally select an oil lam p, with glass s haped lik e a floral calyx or a uterus, but one should only ever burn wax or stear ine n ightligh ts in it, which will last for aroun d eight hou rs. Oil, apar t from necessarily giving a co at of gr ease to all the glass surfaces of the lam p through capillary action, could fall over on the Altar or the floor, causing irreparable havoc. The use of a special lam p of the sanctuary type, is recomm ended and written about in the m anuscript cited abo ve: “The Sacred Mag ic of Abram elin the Mage ” (Arsenal Library), and by Eliphas Lévi: Vol. II, pages 132 and 133, and page 102 (engraving). Alphonse Gallais on page 32 included a foot note which shows a lam p of t his type. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan 5) The Censer and Boat . – A Church Censer or else an oriental-style incense-burner, either in copper or brass, gilded or not. In the latter case, one s hould rem ove the crescent moon, which is m ost often figured upon it, from the top cover. The church type, which is tall and narrow with chains, is to be preferred, as th is f acilitates the r itu alistic censing s in the room , about the Theurgist. W ith an ordi nary incense-burner it is always possible to burn the fingers even after only a short tim e. The Censer is accom panied by a Boat, which is a little recep tacle in the form of a boat or antique lamp, which can also be in copper or not, and which holds the incense. It is also place u pon the Altar, beside the Censer. A little spoon is usually attached to it by means of a short chain. Khunrath, in diagram 11 of “Am phitheater of the Eternal W isdom ” shows a censer am ong the objects furnishing the m agical Laboratory; Agrippa, book IV, page 36, mentions it am ong the ritual ob jects of the m agic ian; Piobb, page 240, also m entions it. Adding a boat, a little container for the incense, is not unusual in itself since the censer is always sold with a boat, and this is o ften accom panied by a little spoon for the incense by the m akers of religiou s artifacts. The censer with chains a llow s for circular fum igations, which an incense-burner does not. 6) The Crystal Sphere . – A crystal ball, obviously. These balls are still called “Hindu Mirrors”. They are norm ally used in operations of seeing (crystallom ancy). One should use one with a diam eter of 10 to 15 centim eters, and select one, which is quite spherical. G et rid of the wooden support, whic h com es with the ball, and replace it with a copper bowl, which fits the bottom of the s phere well, to a height of less than a centim eter, so that it doesn’t wobble. An incense-burner in the shape of a bowl of oriental style perform s this duty well, but one needs to use a conical or truncated con ical shape, since an incense-burner with three f eet risks being easily knocked over. Beneath the ball, in the bowl, one puts som e water, so that it is ba thed in it. One m ay also put down a s mall m etal or parchm ent pentacle, and we shall see w hat type shortly 10 . The water can also som etim es be replaced by fine river san d. These balls, serving both as a m agic m irror and a condenser, have been purchasable at occult bookstores for over thirty years, both in France and abroad. Made by Carl Zeiss, at Iena, before the W ar the best ones were de stin ed f or tem ples in Asia. These balls are always purchased together with a black w ood support, which are quickly discarded so that one m ay m oisten the bottom of the ball. They are cited in the book by Bosc: “Magic Mirrors” (Paris 1912), and by Dr. Paul Joire, in his work “Psychic Phenom ena” (Paris 1909). The idea of adding a pentacle on parchm ent, under the ball, as is also spoken of in our “Practical Talism ans”, is unpublished.   10 One ass umes Am bel ain m eans beneat h t he bowl whi ch, i f it goi ng to contain wat er, would q uickly erase any design on a parchm ent ! – PV . 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan 7) The Great Meta llic Pe ntacle s . – The described Pentacle is in reality double. A Hexagram (Seal of Solomon) and a Pentagram (S tar of David). One is in lead, the other in copper (they should regularly be of silver and gold), contained in a circumference of 20 to 30 cen tim eters in d iam eter, and which will be used sim ultaneou sly. W hen one of them is vertical, and hanging on the wall a bove the Altar, between the tw o Candlesticks placed a little in front, th e second is in front of the Lam p and between these two Candlesticks, a little behind the Censer and the Crysta l Spher e (in the cen ter of the triangle form ed by the Lam p-Cense r-Sphere). Neither of them should be enclosed in a “circle”: on the contrary, the poi nts of the stars must ray freely. The Hexagram signifies “Severity” (in Hebrew, Solomon signifies prison, punishm ent); the second signi fies “Mercy” (in Hebrew, David signifies Love). The first has two sens es: Salem or Salom , m eani ng Peace, Equilib rium, Beatitud e, and also Shlom : Seve rity, Punishm ent, Prison. This is the seal, which Solom on us ed to im prison the genies, as legend tells us... The Pentagram is indisputably the star of light and love, being the symbol of Venus, of Anael, and thus in correspondence with the equivalent Sephirotic level. The Hexagram is Faith, Understanding. The Pentagram is Knowledge, Hope and Charity. The Hexagram is the im age of the Father; the Pentag ram that of the Son. The idea of having a pentacle above the Altar, and another on the Altar itself, and the idea of only using the Pentagram (sta r with f ive p oints) and th e Hexagram (sta r with s ix points) is not new. Eliphas Lévi, Vol. I, page 268 and Vol. II, page 96; and Agrippa, Book IV, page 35, teach it. 8) The “Luciferum” or Active Candle . – The Luciferum is a special candle, analogous to that carried by penitents and the faithful in processions or religious cerem onies. One should select a candle about a meter tall, and with a diam eter going from 40 to 15 m illim eters from one end to the o ther. It should be d ecorated with a holder made of red velvet, fringed with gold (vel vet, wax, gelatin and wood charcoal are all substances which condense “astral light” perfec tly). This holder should be fixed about a third up the candle. As the candle is conica l, and since the holder m ight slip, it m ay be fixed with two silk ligatures. The substitu tion of the almond or hazel W and of t he m agicians of for mer tim es by a wax taper is well known. Le Forestier, in his book on the “Elus Cohen”, page 85, cites texts from the Eighteenth Century, drawn from letters by Martinez de Pasqually to his discip les, w hich show him using the wax candle in place of th e operative wand. Upon the wax, imm ediately after its consecr ation, the following “Divine Na mes” are to be engraved near the base, beneath the holde r, with the aid of a silver or copper needle (gold is b est), each occu pying one of the four sectors of the s ection : 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan Yvcb 11 “Bachur” (L ight). Hyn 12 “Niah” (Go d of Light). Hyz “Ziah” (Shining and Lum inous God). Hyd “Diah” (Gates of Light). Towards the top, close to the extrem ity of the candle, just before the wick, one engraves the fifth He brew Divine Nam e: Avayav \u001f\u001f “Aeyahouah” Acrostic of the Hebrew phrase signifyi ng “And God said let there be Light...” (Genesis 1 :3). The Luciferum is the magic wand of Theu rgy, replacing the branch of almond or hazel, which are m entioned in ord inary m agic ritu als. W hen not being us ed and held in the r ight han d of the Theurgist, it is p ut uprigh t into a Candlestick, at the f oot of the Altar. 9) The Sword . – This is a sword with a straight blade, full bladed or two-edged (and a lozenge in cross- sectio n), with a gr ip in white, black or light horn; pom mel and cross- guard in copper, which m ay be gilded. The guard m ust always be crucial.

They should be m ade fr om two pieces of lead, around 20 centim eters in diam eter, and about on e centim eter or less th ick (total weight: around 6 kilogram s), carrying engravings of the figures of a Hexagram and a Pentagram. The first will be pectoral (chest) and the second dorsal, according to the tim es of the Operations. One m ay add Kabbalistic inscript ions drawn from the Scriptures to these Figures. They can be carried with the aid of two straps passing over the shoulders, and fixed on the torso by two red velvet ribbons joining the two together. The necessary wearing o f the Pentagram and the Hexagram , as protecting pentacles, upon the Operator him self, is attested to by E liphas Lévi, vol. II, page 66 and 96. W e cite the pectoral and dorsal pent acles in lead in “Cathédr ales”, pages 60, 61, 64, 65, 66 and 67. One can forge them oneself with the aid of a plumber’s torch (or at least an old iron stove). The plaster m old is prepared in advan ce, in a plate or m etal receptacle. W hen the lead is liquid, it is carefully poured into the m old; with the help of an iron fork or spoon one should rem ove the slag floating on the surf ace, and leave it to cool. It can be taken out of the mold when it is well se t. T ake car e to e nsure tha t no m oisture r emains in the plaster. This can result in spattering by the m olten m etal.

For our part, we give preference to Pentacles without circles around them . The points of the stars are thus m ore exposed, and can freely radiate, which is essential. A circle m odifies th e rad iation of the Pentacle. E. Ritual Vestments The ensem ble consists of undergarments and symbolical vestm ents. The first are to help the Operator avoid being in contact w ith underwear polluted by everyday by use, or through contact with corporeal organs. The la tter have the effect of m aking of the Theurgist a true m icrocosm , in whic h sym bols a nd paradigm s, as expressed in the em broidery, establish points of contact with the Superior At tributes of the Macrocosm . We will see this sho rtly. 1) Undergarments . – The operator will furnish him self with a shirt of linen cloth, with drawers in the same m aterial. The shirt will have long sleeves, closed at the wrists, and a collar, which can be tightened with a running ribbon or sm all cord. The drawers are short, down to the knees at m ost. It shoul d have a waistband of co rd or, better still, buttoned straps or an elastic m artingale. 2) Symbolic Vestments . – T hese com prise a Cloak, a Miter or a T iara, and Sandals. The Robe is a long tun ic falling to the ground, a few fingers above the floor. The sleeves have drawstrings at the wr ists , like those o n the shirt, to avoid the possibility of upsetting any of the objects on the Altar. The n eck is closed at the shoulder or the chest by three or five buttons covered with the sam e m aterials as the robe. It will be bound at the waist by a cincture m ade of a band of m aterial or by a la rge Cordelier, in a colo r a little d arke r than the Rob e. One can be content with a single Robe to be gin with, and this should alw ays be white. If one can, three Robes m ay be us ed for the follo wing Operations: a) Purple or Crim son Robe: Cerem onies of Evocation and Invocation of Higher Powers. b) White Robe: Operations of occult Th erapeu tics : m agnetism , etc... c) Black Robe: Exorcism s, conjurations of Malefic Forces, and spiritual Meditations or Exercises.

On his feet the Theurgis t wears Sand als or lo w Shoes, in leather, canvas, cork, etc. Rubber is proscribed, as it is too isolati ng and generates a dampness contrary to good fluidic circulation. There shoul d be three pairs of Sandals corresponding to the Robes, if possible. It is better to a void lea ther, whic h usually requ ires a fair m etallic presenc e in the nails, which hold it together. Regarding the head, one m ay operate with h ead bare or covered.

It is possible that the alm ond branch which Eliphas Lévi associates with the Key of Solom on (the Hexagram in the Pentacle), in Operations of Theurgy, cited in the “Sacred Magic of Abram elin the Mage”, and the Ritual of Avignon (“Illum inati” of Don Pernetty), is in fact an error, arising from a poor translation of the Scriptures. In fact, in identical Cerem onies, Martinez de P asqually an d the ritual of the Elus Cohen, proscribing the sword or wand, im pose the use of a wax Candle . Now, in the Book of Jerem iah (I, II), the tr anslato rs have sev erally translated this verse, hesitating to translate “shaked” (a lm ond) or “shakad” (watcher). Only the masoretic p oints would allow the d istinc tion of this nuance. Som etim es one m ay read: “The word of the Lord cam e unto me, sayi ng, Jerem iah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree . Then said the Lord unto m e, Thou hast well seen: for I watch for th e execution of m y Words...” Other tim es it is tr ansla ted: “...And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree . Then said the Lord unto m e, Thou hast well seen : for I am a Rod who watches for the execution of m y W ords...” Now, the rod, which watches, is incontesta bly a Candle. Around the Christian altar, Candles symbolize the Angels of the Celestial c ourt, and th e two candles, which m ust be of beeswax (in the term s of the Canon), on either side of the vertical crucifix, are the two great Archangels. And the Book of Enoch calls Angels the “Watchers of Heaven”. Lenain, in h is book “Mysterious Science”, te lls u s the following on the su bject of the Theurgic Wand: “Kabbalis ts write the na me Agla on the m ysterio us wand which serves in Kabbalis tic events, and here is how they do it: one m ust cut a branch of one year of age, of virgin hazel tree o r bush, which is to say that the tree m ust never h ave born fruit, and that no branch should have been cut or broken, whic h is easy to find on a sm all shrub tree with new growth.

These Forces are subd ivided into : a) Entities (from the schola stic La tin entitas : be ing). The Entity is a “princ iple ” whose existence is d istinct f rom the actua l thing it deno tes.

Entities Entities are nam ed differently acco rding to race, religion and epoch: Gods, goddesses, seraphim , cherubim , archangels, angels, devas, gandarvas, daimons, geni(us)es 33 , etc, and designate different natures in detail, but always one in principle. Their purpo se is, in the ir own little s phere or in the plane in which they e volve, to collabo rate as m uch in the crea tion a s in th e p reservation of the Universe. The creativ e Logos uses them to adm inister His Work.

Before them, Plotinus, Iamblichus, P ytha goras, P lato, Socrates, Moses, and all the mystics had reached the sam e conclusion. * * * According to universal tradition, th ere are three types of Entity. Only term inology differs between races, religions and places. Those in the First Order belong to the supercelestial world. They have no governm ent over the things of the world, and pe rform no m inistry. Th ey are intellectual spheres, “pure spirits” in the com plete sense of the word. They alone are turned towards the Absolute. Moreover they serv e as the ex ecutive channel with regard to the m edian class. Catholic Angeology has the Seraphim , Cherubim and Thrones in th is c lass. Those in the Second Order, or interm ediary class, are situated in the cel estial world. The ancient philosophers called them mundane daimons , since they did not w ork in the d irec t servic e of th e Creato r, but in th e sph eres of the World. These are the anim ators of the Primum Mobile . Catholic theologians class them as Dominations , Powers and Virtues . Kabbalists see them simply as th e Angels of the spheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the lunar planet. To this class also belong the geniu ses of the Decans, Faces an d Degrees, of the Zodiacal sphere or the Fixed Stars, and those of the Twelve Celestial Signs. Finally, the third category is that of terrestrial g eniuses . Herm etic philosophers placed them in four categ ories, accord ing to th e four elem ents (fire, air, water, earth ). Origen, the Christian philosopher, tells us that they particip ate in our lives here below by guiding our actions, according to the nature p ecu liar to ea ch of them . The Catholic theolog ians see in them the three fi nal choirs of Angels, which include Principalities , Archangels , and “guardian” Angels 35 . The Herm etists assu re us that these b eings orient us towards the dom ain which is proper to them when we are, in ourselves , turned towards the m spiritua lly .

One m ay adm it that th ey are neu tral in their actio n, and lead u s towards a pu rely veg etative lif e, if we atta ch ourselves too clos ely to inanim ate m atter (avarice, ind ifference to wards ideals , etc...). * * * In these four elem ents (Fire, Air, W ater, Earth) one shoul dn’t see the physical things defined in present day expression, but sym bolic essences , with all that this analogy suggests. Then our Reason will b e able to conc eive th ese B eings as currents , intelligences , living thing s , but with a rudim entary intelligence, for exam ple, ignorant that elem ents different to theirs ex ist. We will retu rn to th em shortly, while studying “ Matter ”, material support of talism anic “ Form ”. These currents , these forces, connect to us th rough our spiritual or sensual orientation. We establish a contact with them , and in the ir turn they tak e us in th e e xact direction of the beyond, into the spiritual realms, which are their own . And if we visualize them in the course of m etaphysical m anifestations, either ecsta tic o r magica l, we will b e led to express the m according to an exac t mode, unchangeable whatever the individual who is the object. And herein is the key. Hum an m orphology alone does not people the psychic universe, for the thoughts of m an and the gam es of his creative im agin ation are only one of the m any aspects of Universal L ife. Eternal s ubstance thu s assu mes many for ms in the heart of which strange creatures are manifested. It is certain that these form s do not in fact assum e the intuitive countenances given them by our im agination in its analogical reverie. These corpor eal realizations are far from the f eeble stab ility of tangib le Ma tter. They are infinitely free, moveable, fluid and changeable.   But since ou r intellect intuitiv ely ac ts to recogn ize Man as being the highe st aspect of Form , and since logical experien ce gives him proof of this, it follows that rightly or wrongly we almost always attri bute an anthropom orphic countenance to the entities which populate the eternal substratum 36 . 36 The Astral of o ccu ltists. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

But does the form al beauty in which we instinctively clothe them imply a m oral beauty? Not at all! For we only perceive the external side of these beings, and not their inner sta te , which is only visible th rough experience and after th ese beings are revealed to us over a long tim e through their actions . Until th en, we only perceive one thing, an inte lligence at work in a substance more refined than ours (and which creates an illusion for us), which it m oulds, kneads, and transf orms at will.   Also, the Be ings, which live in the h eart of the eternal Substratum , can fa scinate us with an apparent beauty, proceeding from th eir essential superiority over us. But this is not a strong proof of Goodness and Purity. A nd these Beings have the sam e interest in us that we have for bees, which give us th eir honey. “The Gods”, Shakespeare tells us, “serve m en as m en serve torches! T hey only illum inate them for their ow n use...” Certainly it is possible for them to comm une to a certain extent with the Superior Divine Power Him self, within the lim its of their greater or lesser spirituality. W ithout doubt, power put into service of the most ego tistical intelligence in existence is less frightening than the fearf ul and des tructive stupidity of an obscuring Pow er. But for these Gods it is a n ecessity; m an however great h is holiness, cannot pro long his life except by destroying the life of other natural beings, be they vegetable or anim al. The East speaks to us of “hum an livestock, fatte ned by the gods!” The W est tells us that “God is a fire which burns!” and the mystics agree that it is enough to have been placed for a single instant in the presence of a bel oved G od so that, receiv ing the kiss of fire o f these m ysterious nuptials, “the soul is overcom e in Hi m forever...”. Also if, as Martinez de Pasqually affirm ed to his disciples, “Man is by right their Master”, how m any theurgists are neverthele ss strong enough to approach these psychic Beings, and understand them rather than to in tuit them , and to preserve them selves from the fatal “attraction” which constitutes this very m ethod? Very few, no doubt! And yet this is the g reat secret of operative Gnosis , the redoubtable arcana of “Life Eternal”, known to the gods , and liberated from them .

The subconscious receives this perception from the higher consciousness , a little like a vague intuition, poorly defined.

The details of the image specify this for us. When the visualized form is half-hum an and half-anim al, the entity is clearly from a lower plane. The charac ter istic of its partial anim ality will def ine its true na tur e. As such were represented the gods of ancien t Egypt, gods with heads of a lion, a lioness, a hawk, a cat, an ib is, etc., or the gnostic Abraxas , the m an wi th the head of a cockerel, im age of the Sun (the bird which a nnounces the rising of this astral body). When the visualized form is purely anim al or monstrous, it is rare for it to act in a perf ectly n atural f orm . Usually th e apparition w ill b e com posite. W e can then be su re that this entity in ques tion is close to us and that this shoul d incite us to be suspicious.

But, once more, le t us n ote tha t the se Entities a re powers , currents , and nothing more. We visualize them in two dimensions, but this should not convin ce you that they are two-dim ensional beings. Perhaps they sometimes only have one dimension ...

Egregores We give the nam e Egregore to a Force generated by a powerful spiritual current and later fed at regular intervals, conf orm ing to a rhythm in harm ony with the Universal Life of the Cos mos, or to a m eeting of Entities united by a comm on characteristic. In the Invisible, outside of the physical perception of Man, th ere exist artificial beings, generated by devotion, enthusiasm or fanaticism , whi ch we call egregores. T hese are the hearts of the great spir itual currents, good or evil. The Mystical Church , Celes tial Jerusalem , the Body of Christ , and all su ch title s, are th e qualifications, which give communion to the egregore of Catholicism . Freem asonry, Pr otestantism , Islam , and Buddhism have egregores. Great po litical ideologies have them too. Psychically integrated through ritual initiation or through an intellectual adherenc e to these cu rren ts, the af filia te becom es one of its co nstitu tiv e ce lls. He augm ents the power of the egregore through the qualities or faults which he possesses, and in exchange, the egregore isolates him from the external f orces of the physical world, and with the colle ctiv e f orce it had p revious ly stored, greatly enhan ces th e feeble m eans of activity of the m an who joins with it. Instinctively, popular la nguage gives the nam e of “circle” to an egregore, thus in tuitively expressing the idea of a circuit . Between th e constitutive cell and the egregore – that is to say, between the affiliate and the group – a sort of inner psychic circul ation is thereby established. This explains why opponents of such a concept , on studying the origin, nature and life of this concept , often end by joining with it or at least by espousing a part of the theories, even without their knowledge. They are connected to a current, which, as it is more powerful than thos e who are prim itivel y lin ked to it, carries them unknowingly away from the road that they im agined they were following. If they were free of any affiliation 41 , this action w ould only be the m ore brutal and strong. This rule holds for all great currents of ideas: philosophical, religious and politica l. * *   But a spiritual current cannot become aliv e in the occult sense of the word, unless ritu als v italize it. Eg reg ores ar e vita lized concep ts . This explains why only hum an associations having a ritual character (Catholic religion, Ma sonry, Martinism , etc) can expect to generate an egregore, and cons equently, for it to endure for a long tim e. 41 Th is wo rks on bo th a ph ysical an d psych ic level: any scien tific writer proposing a rad ically d ifferen t theory to the no rm will fin d hi m- or herself ostracized by the scien tific commu nity, as well as feeling the force of going agai nst its egregore (for right or wrong), if he or she doe s not bel ong to another power ful egrego re (perhap s a scien tist tryin g to introdu ce astro log ical th eory in to astron omy will t o so me ex ten t be shielde d by the egregore of as trologers ?) in the first place – PV. 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

The egregore will be slo wly destroy ed when it is abandoned to itself, with no rituals, no spiritual current being generate d through precise occult rules, which would perpetu ate its existence. The incineration of its living m embers a nd the w ritings connected with it, alone assure the destruction of the physical body and of the double of all beings or all things. A sim ple, ordinary death (without the total destru ction of the image ), while it rem oves material life, is not an obstacle to astral life. Moreover, a death accom panied by the shedding of blood will o nly strength en the occu lt vitality of an egregor e, by virtu e of the mysterious power of blood when it is liberated u nder a sacr ificia l form . This explains why the pagan persecutions against Christianity in fact only served to increase its abundance; equally, the fact th at heretics and their writings were often destroyed by fire. Here one can see that the Cath olic Church surm ised the secret of th e life of egreg ores . The reaction s of the egregore toward s an expelled cell are often very dangerous, although always affecting a perfectly natural dem eanor. Most often th is rejection will considerably m odify the des tiny of th e “excomm unicated”, a d estiny alread y m odified once before through th e affiliation. When quitti ng an egreg ore, he would be prudent to integrate him self, even if only for a mom ent, with the idea of an equivalent but opposite power. * * * Just as the c onstitu tiv e c ells of an eg regore are d rawn f rom hum anity itself , form the m aterial plane, so other constitutive cel ls of this egrego re are ex tracted for m the world of entities. Thus the egrego re live s on the physical plane (w here it acts through the interm ediary of Man) and on the higher plane (w here it acts through the interm ediary of the Entities). It thus po ssesses a body , a double , a soul . This has its equivalent in the triple Church: militant (terrest rial), sufferin g (astral), and triumph ant (ce lestial). * * * The rhythm of life of th e egregore being assured through ritual, one m ay easily understand that the least disturbance of this ri tual brings with it an identical disturbance 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Once established and perpetuated thr ough usage and tim e, a ritual cannot be modified without causing a weakening of the eg regore. This explains why this secret is of particular im portance in rituals of Initiation. * * * Just as Divine Names , Words of Power , etc (that is to sa y, ritual definitions hallowed by custom ), concurrently allow for mulae, prayers and invocations (also hallowed by custom ) to establish a spirit ual rapport between Ma n and God, so also special and s ecret nam es, words and form ulae are used to awaken and establish th e egregore.

This im plies that there is , of necessity, a hierarch al structu re in all Associations. Equality, if one m ust have equality, can onl y be set up for th e “i nner circle” placed in charge of the egregore. * * * Finally, the great cosm ic laws and most pa rticularly those relating to tim e, epochs, duration, m ust collaborate in the life of the egregore.   This explains why all great cerem onial r ituals, be they religi ous or philosophical, are held at the equinoxes a nd the solstices, or on dates corresponding with these four great annual divisions, and their flows. E qually, the progression of the Stars is observed, as well as the influence, which can be obt ained from a location, and orientation, etc 43 ... * * * The conventional image of an egregore, its m ental representation, equate to a reality in the astral plane or imm ediate hyperphysical worl d.

Such are, su ccessiv ely, the Seal of Solo mon or Hexagram , the Pentagram or Star of David 44 , the Latin Cross, the Masonic Triangle and the innum erable signs and seals, repres enting Entities, wh ich are trans mitted to us in the books of Magic an d Kabbalah.

T hen it no longer obeys the im pulses, which the master s of the sect transm it to it through the interm ediary of ritual, and, no longer a docile slave, it often becom es a fierce tyrant.

Now, this very tolerance assures that s oul of a prolongation of his stay in this place of suffering. One the other h and, the purif ication of the Soul is th e required state for his liberation from the tenebrous soj ourn. This law was form ulated by Egyptian asceticism thus: “None m ay approach the Throne of Osiris without first being purified by Water and by Fire”.

He is the Very Low One, the God of the Realm of Darkness. One m ay give him a more precise definition in saying that he is the sem i-conscious sp irit (we use the word ‘conscious’ as an accountable synonym ) of this realm , which is lim ited in Space, and constitutes the Cone of Shadow.

The m an, w ho wakes during the night, a little after midnight, finds him self in a stat e d ifferent to that in which he was before going to sleep. He will be exposed to a type of psychic w eakness, which he did not feel when the sun bathed the hem isphere with its rays. The cau se is not his short passage through the world of sleep. Sleep offers total security. But a door has been closed on this f oreign land, which allow s the being to renew himself. The bad influence com es from the shadows them selves, since a ll that is contained in the cone of shadow of the Earth, all this m ass of hostility and millenary h ate, return s agains t the living.

The psychic influence of the place of death acts upon the living through anguish , disgust , then despair . For it is nocturnal despair which has no rem edy save the com ing of the Morning light.

Thus the Néom énies, or conjunction of the Sun and Moon (new m oon) is a monthly date reserved for operations of low m agic. In effect, at that very m oment, the Moon intercepts the solar rays. Now, studies in Astrology show the funereal role, played in hum an de stiny by this astral aspect, w ith regard to events and m oral changes undergone by the psyche.

The world of Briah, the dom ain where the Divine Personae becom e “m anifestations” which are already individua lized, (Principal Arch angels of the Ten Orders), corresponds to the instan tan eous manife station of this eternal, higher Soul.

It is the “point” which m akes Adam etern al. It is also called the me ns . As it draws its m anifestation from the Divine anim ating fraction of the created Universe, it therefore depends on Malkuth, the Queen, la st and lowest phase of the Divine manif estation itse lf.

The final one connects Da’ath, Tiphereth and Yesod. At the ends of these three paths, Kether and Malkuth m ark the extrem e lim its of this pe riple of the R uach El ohim . This Pillar is called the “Pillar of Equilib rium” 69 or the “ Royal Road ”. The true aw akening of Ruach and spiritua lity takes place when the Ruach rises up along the vertebrae colum n, passing through the centr al channel of this fluidic column (which has n o connectio n with the s pinal m arro w), which constitu tes th e central p illar or “Pillar of Equilib rium ”.

For a Tantric, the Yantra, who follows a cult of adoration ruled by the m inutest ritual, is also a divine effig y , a “veh icle”. It is the sam e for the Kabbalis t: the “Divine Nam e” as a word, or the sam e word drawn in a Pentacle, is a “vehicle” of th e Divin e.

From this we can see the possibility of absolute confusion on a particular subject, or of becom ing unbalanced by nourishing a banal and m ateria listic “obses sio n”, or of becom ing fixated on or clinging to a m etaphysical “im age”, which will carry him , like a ship, towards tran scendental “realm s” where the presen ce of the ABSOLUTE can be pierced... Let us explain here and now that “im ages” whi ch can serve well in the exercise of mental concentration are innum erable, but that the Kabbalist has an in terest in only using those which have already been vitalized by tr aditional and secular usag e. These are th e “ vita lized -co ncepts”... Let us also note that color is not unimportant here. Red , especiallypurple or crim son, has a tonic, exciting effect on psyc hic life. By contrast , the color blue is calm ing, quieting. W e will retu rn to this idea later. But what we m ust strive to obtain before all else is the lumino sity of these “im ages”. We m ust see them illuminated from the insid e , as if they ar e radiating this light them selves. W e must never see them shaded by a troubled illum ination com ing from the side. The problem of the lum inosity of “im ages” is most im portant. Our Science m akes of Light an electrom agnetic vibration, in which electricity is the bas is of the structu re and the equilib rium of all molecu les. A growing taste for life in the open air, and for sunbathing, represents an instinctive return to wards this m aterial Light, w hich is an im age of Metaphysical L ight... As for an identity between the “Inner God” reuni ted by m ental concentration on an “im age” and the sam e “light” obtained thr ough this concentration, one m ay see it laid bare by all founders of religion if one strips the texts of all seconda ry interpretations and 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan takes them in their liter al sense. For Scriptu re tells us that “G od is a consum ing Fire”; the Koran that the believer should im agine “God is a Light within a Light”; and the Gospel of Saint John that: “...in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men...” The meditation-respiration com bination was introduced into Kabbalah by Abraham Abulafia who, m oreove r, added the secret of attitud e (postures), as in yoga, and also that of movements . Why, at the heart of this self-realization, does rhythm ic breathing occupy such an im portant place? Becau se it jo ins to gether all th e principa l m echanis ms: physiological action on the circulation, above all of che mical exchanges (not only pulm onary but also at a cellular level), the great plasticity of rhythm , and a fr eedom of thought comm ensurate with the res pira tory ac t. It is also res pira tion which is th e ch aracteristic function of Life on which we unceasing ly depend in o ur liv ing env ironm ent a nd, at the same tim e, the only function of our vegetative lives which we can distin ctively modify through exercising our will. The respiratory function establishes a liaison between our re lative lif e an d our vegetative life. It therefore has a fu ndam ental place in the m astery of the body. By means of modifications, respirato ry changes lead to chem ical changes at tissue level brought about through an increase in ener gy exchanges, the B rain finds itself in exceptionally favorable conditions for the enhancem ent of thoughts during such an exercise. * * * The “sense of the Divine” expre sses itself above all through religious em otiveness and by m eans of the rituals, cerem onies and sacrifices which flow from them . It reveals its highes t expression through Prayer. “H oly m en of God”, Kabbalistic tradition tells us, “when they wish to journe y on the Thirty-tw o Paths of W isdom, begin by m editating on the holy Psalm s, and pr epare them selves beforehand through holy orisons”. B ut Prayer, like the “sense of the holy” which it expresses, is from all evidence a spiritual phenom enon. And, like the judici ous observation of Dr. Carrel, the Spiritual World is beyond the reach of our modern expe rim ental techniques. How then m ay one acquir e a po sitiv istic un derstand ing of Prayer ? The scien tific world f ortunately includes the totality of all that is observable, and through the interm ediary of Physiology, it can be extended to the m anif estations of the Spiritu al. T hus, by system atic observation of m an in the act of prayer, we will learn : wh at com prises the pheno menon of Pr ayer, th e technique for its production and its effects. In fact, Pray er rep resen ts Man’s effort to commune with any o f the incorpo real o r metaphysical entities: ancestors, guides, saints , archetypes, gods, etc., or with the Prim al Cause, summ it of the preceding py ram id. Far fr om consistin g of a vain and m onotonous recitation of for mulae, true Prayer represents a “mystic state” for m an, a state in which 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan consciousness is absorbed into the Absolute. This state is not of an intellectual nature. It also rem ains inaccessib le – even inco mprehensible – to the Ph ilosopher an d the Thinker. In order to pray, one m ust m ake an effort to strain towards Divinity. “Think of God more often than breathing...” said Epith ets. Even very short m ental invocations can keep m an in the “p resence” of God. Besides, another as pect of Prayer is its “constructive” role, working in the “spiritual realm s”: whic h rem ain unknown or unexplored. “Ora et Labora”, says the ancient herm etic motto, “p ray and work”. A popular adage adds: “To work is to pray”. Let us conclude that perhaps, in the sam e order of ideas, praying equates to working. All depends on what is understood by this word. Perhaps the m an who prays is building for him self, in a nother world, his “glorious body”, the “body of light” of which the Manicheans spoke, and which is his “Celestial Jerusalem ”, his own “Divine City”, his “ Interior Temple ”? Then one may adm it that the m an who does not pray does not weave his own immortality, and that h e deprives h imself of an important tre asure. Then each of us would find, “beyond death”, everything he had hoped for and encountered in this terrestrial life. The atheist, therefore, travels to N othingne ss, believing it to be another Life. Psychologically, the “sense of the Divin e” seems to be an impulse which com es from the deepest part of our nature, a funda mental activity, and it m ay equally be found am ong pri mitiv e tribes and in civ ilized society. These variations are link ed to m any other funda mental activ ities no tably : m oral sense, aes thetic sense, and personal will. The opposite is also true. And, as Dr. Carrel obs erved, history shows that the loss of m oral and sacred sense in the m ajority of people who com pose a nation quickly leads to its fall and its subjection by a neighboring people, w ho have preserved what this nation lost through its o wn fault. Greece, Rom e, etc, are examples, which illus trate this point. On the other hand, m an i s a com posite of tissues and organic liquids, penetrated by an im ponderable elem ent called Conscious ness. Now, the living body, sum of its tissues and organic liquids, has its own existe nce, linked to a regular correspondence with the contingent Universe. Isn’ t one therefore allo wed to suppose that Consciousness, if it lives in m aterial organs, also continues at the sam e time outside of the physical continuum ? Can we not believe that we are immersed in a “S piritual Universe”, (by the fact of our Consciousness), a universe th rough w hich we cannot pass except through our body of flesh in the Material Universe, from wh ich the elem ents of one’s preservation are extracted: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and through the work of nutritional and respiratory functions? In this “Spir itua l Univer se”, in whic h our Consciousness draws the very essence of its own preserva tion a nd its m oral “health ”, is it perm itted to see the IM MANENT BEING, the First Cause, which ordinary re lig ions call “God” ? If we answer in the affir mative, Prayer cou ld then be con sidered to be the agent of na tura l re lations betwee n Consciousness and its own milieu , in the sam e way that resp iration and nutrition are for the physical body. 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan From this it would not be m ore prideful – whatever Nietzsche says – to pray than to breathe, to m editate than to eat or drink. Prayer is also the e quivalent of biological activity, dependent upon on our stru cture, and this is thus a natural and normal function of our spirit . To neglect it would be to atrophy our own “principal ”, in a w ord, our soul. Still it is im portant to distinguish form from act! The recitation of foolish for mulae, repetitions in which the sp irit ha s no p lace, where the lips alone have any true activ ity, is n ot to pray! Moreover it is n eces sary for the inner m an, which Claude de Saint-M artin called the “ Man of Desire”, to be attentive and dynam ize that which lips and brain together express. Joined to intuition, to moral and aesthetic se nse, and to the intellect, the “sense of the Divine” brings th e h uman being to fully bl oom. So, it is not in doubt that su ccess in life requ ires a full and in tegral d evelo pm ent of each of our physio logical, intellectual, em otional and spiritua l faculties.

In this, Pla to w as righ t when he told us that to m erit the nam e of m an, one must have “m ade a child, planted a tree, and written a book”. For Claude de Saint-Martin, s ince th e “W ord” of the Absolute was necess arily concretized in a new “hy postasis”, alone penetr ating the con tingent world, it is b ecaus e it is possible that the “W ord” of Man, in its tur n, could create the possibi lity of entering the “Spiritual U niverse ” when it is expe ditious ly attracted and oriented by his Superior Consciousness. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

This is what Martin ez de Pasqu ally called “our year”. In fact, for the Elus-Cohen, the year was six m onths long, running from one equinox to the other. To begin with, it is convenient to cho ose the p lace where one will operate during the following six m onths, shortly before Passover 78 . If one lives in the country, in a rem ote place, one has th e choice of s electing a s mall forest with spaces and clus ters of trees. In a clearing, set up a sm all altar of turf, cove red with an edifice of twigs. On the altar, one places th e Lamp and the Censer. The Lam p must rem ain constantly lit during the six lunar cycles. Around the altar, seven steps away, prepare a low pile of flowers, grass and g reen shrubs, so that this h edge clearly separates th e consecrated space fro m the res t of th e wood. The altar is in the circ le; ou tside is th e “profane world”. One will take care to leave an adequate opening in the he dge. It helps, if this is possible, if the wood is situated at the top of a s mall hill or an elevation. If one lives in town, one should select a house endowed with an adjacent terrace, preferably covered and with white pine floor ing. The adjacent terrace should have a covering of river sand, fine and cl ean, to a depth of two finge rs. The altar will be erected in the center of the Oratory. It could be of wood, and present the aspect vertically of a double cube, the height of a cubit and a half (one m eter). The altar destined for an outside Operation can be of unfinished stones, set up to form a rough cube. In the Oratory, one should set aside an arm oire destined to hold the Vestm ents and sacred O bjects, as well as reserv es of ingredients: oil, charcoal, incense, etc...   In case of difficulty in achieving all th ese conditions, one should do one’s best to do as m uch as possib le. 77 Th is en tire sectio n, the object s and the basic ritu al, co me fro m ‘Le Martinis me’ b y R.

In those of the ritual of Avignon, it is m ade of crim son silk, covered in an alb of white lace, which falls to the knees. There is no waistband. In the ritual of Abra melin, the Robe is lim ited to a crim son and gold jacket, which falls to the k nees. The waistb and is o f the sam e color. In the ritual of the Elus-Cohe n, the Operator is barehead ed. In the ritual of Avignon, he wears a “low” gilded m iter. In the ritual of Abra melin, the Operator wears a band about the forehead, a hand’s width wide, in crim son a nd gold silk. The Operato r who follows the prescripti ons of Dom Pernetty (Ritual of the “Illum inated of Avignon”) also carries upon his low m iter, a tr iangular golden plaque (or, at a pinch, silver) on which is engraved in Hebrew characters the word “KAES” (Ka ph, Aleph, Heh, Shin 79 ). It would be a good idea to have a clean wh ite housecoat, of linen or flax, which one wears to enter the Oratory and is reserv ed for this use. It could be kept in the arm oire when one dons the ritual clothing described above. A pair of Sandals, of stuff or coarse linen, com pletes the costum e. The Cohen ritu al in sis ts that the soles m ust be of cork. III. – The Pe ntacular Ob jects The ritu al of Martinez de Pasqually allows the wearing of a “s capula r” and a triangular “talism an”. The ritual of Avignon allows the wearing of a “Pectoral” for which we have been unable to find the design. There is no desc ription or figure in th e docum ents we have regarding this Pectoral. It is perh aps based on that described in Exodus. The ritual of Abram elin does not m ention anything sim ilar.   79 I bel ieve t hat this should be: Kap h-Aleph-Aleph -Tzad di, being a notariqon for “ Kadosh Ad onai El ohim Sab aoth”.

Va ughan THE CEREMONIES A) The First Tw o Moons Before engaging in any work of the Opera tion w hich begins at Easter, the Rituals of Abra melin and Avignon prescribe Holy Co mmunion. This is required according to the particular religion of the Operator (Jewish or Christian), in a co mmunion service enacted accord ing to the rites of the Adept. So one m ay, a s one chooses, communicate in a synagogue, a church, a tem ple, or alone, with a few Brothers, etc... The rite itself depends on one’s religion (pasch al lamb for the Jews, host for Catholics, bread and w ine for reform ed or Greek rites, etc... ). * * * The first m orning follow ing Easter, havi ng thoroughly washed or bathed and having put on new vestments or the h ousecoat m entioned in th e presen t Ritual, enter th e Oratory a quarter of an hour before sunrise. Kneel in front of the altar and, facing th e window or door leadi ng to the terrace, invoke the Na me of the Lord. Thank Hi m for his grace, abase yourself and ask His pardon for your faults and errors, implore His benevolence and his kindness in sending you his Holy Angel who m ay serve as you guide in the True Way dispelling all sins of oversight, ignorance and weakness. This prayer is to be rep eated each m orning at dawn throughou t the two lun ar cycles, even if the Operator is sick. C onjugal rights are perm itted during these two months. Each Sabbath (being Saturday for Jews, Sunday for Christians, and Friday for Moslem s), cense the altar, and chang e vestm ents for the day having brushed and perfum ed them . Give alm s or perfor m a ch aritable act during the course of the day.

Pi ers A. Va ughan The twice-daily Orison for these two m ont hs should be longer than that used in the first two lunar cy cles. One should spe nd longer asking for grace to enter the Tru e Way, to one day achieve true wisdom and knowledge by the interm ediation of the Holy Angels. One m ay still engage in conjugal rights during these two m oons. Each Sabbath eve wash or bathe thoroughly, and cleanse th e vestm ents or brush and perfum e the m. That day one should take no food between the rise and setting of the Sun, and abstain from living too finely or abunda ntly. Fasting is recomm ende d. On the day of the Sabbath, perform the sam e actions as for the first two moons. C) The Last Tw o Moons In these two last m onths before the Grand Evocation, perform three prayers in place of the two. These take pl ace a quarter of an hour before dawn, a quarter of an ho ur before noon, and a quarter of an hour before sunset. Wash the face and hand s with lustral water upon entering the Oratory, an d before reciting the holy orisons, say a prayer of confession for the pardon of sins. Ardently ask the Lord for grace to enjoy and bear the presence of the Holy Angels, and ask Him to deign, through their m ediation, to give the secret knowledge. The prayer is thus longer than those of the previous two m oons . W hen lighting the incense b efore each p rayer, do not forget to us e a brief prayer to de dicate the censing to the Nam e of the Lord, to His glory; and pr ay for the Holy Angels to be present and henceforth to assist at the Op erations during these two m oons . It is best to pray with the heart. For that, study the Holy Scriptures, and the Eterna l One will illum ine the m ind of the Operator to th is en d, and the Holy Spirit will penetr ate little by little. Coitus is forbidden in these last two lunar m onths. General Prescriptions Live as alone as you can and avoid b ecom ing angry during these six m onths. After the m ain m eal, study the Holy Scriptur es and the Kabbalah for about two hours. After Morning Prayer, o ne m ay sleep a little m ore if desired. The only thing one m ust not do at any cost is to in terrup t th e daily Or ison s. The room in which one sleeps should, if po ssible, be adjacent to the Oratory. It should be clean and neat, and avoid all prof ane objects or decoration. One’s bed should 10 8"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan be clean, and one should change the sheets each week on the Sabbath eve, and on each of those occasions the room should be censed. These prescriptions should be follow ed throughout the six moons. * * * Regarding the praye rs, one will c arefully note that the o riso ns for the f irst two months (lunar cycles of Aries and T aurus) are preparatory prayers. One asks the Lord to send you His Holy Angel , in order to guide you in the Tr ue Way, and to protect you from failure. In the orisons of the second followi ng lunar cycles (Ge mini and Cancer), you ask God to instruct you through His Holy Angels . In the two last moons (Leo and Virgo), you ask the Lord to give you the strength to rejoice in th e presence of his Holy Angels, to have the strength of soul to bear this presence , and to grant you, through their meditation , the secret knowledge, and, to the Angels themselves, to be present and assist the Operato r , even when invisib le. Finally, at the tim e of the Grand Evo cation, you ask only for their appearance, under one form or another (face, human silhou ette, supernatu ral light, etc...) D) The Consecration   After the tw o last lunar cycles are com plete, the Operator has com e to the end of his long ascetic period. The Néom énie of the Autum nal Equinox, the tim e and date of the Grand Evocation, begins. The m orning of the first day of the Moon of Libra, pray like the previous evening, but barefoot. As usual place coals in the cens er and dress in the prescribed Vestm ent 81 , placing the alm ond Wand lengthways upon the al tar and place in front of the W and the flask of the Oil of Unction. Throw a large am ount of Incense on the coals, kneel and pray thus: “O Lord, God of Mercy, Patient God , Most Bless ed, Most Bo untifu l and Wise, Who grants Your grace in a thousand ways and generations, Who forgets the iniquities, sins and transgressions of men, in Whose Pr esence none are found innocent, who visits the failures of the fa thers on the children and desce ndants unto the third and fourth generation, I know my wretchedness and know that I am not worthy to come before your Divine Majesty, nor to implore and pray Your Goodness and Mercy for the least grace...Nevertheless, Lord of Lords, take pity on me.

Then, having plunged the first three fingers of your right hand into the Oil, anoint the four upper corners of the altar, the p ieces of ritual costum e, the waist-b and, the m iter or the headband, and the almond W and, on both si des. Then, do the sam e to the door and the window, if there is one. Finally, with th e fingers covered with oil, trace these words on the four sides of the altar: “In wh atever p lace, where My Name shall be commemorated, I shall come to you and bless you”. The consecration is ended. Lay out the Objects and Vestm ents, kneel again and pray with th e hear t (The Obj ects sho uld never leave the Orat ory during these six m onths). Henceforth, the Operato r will go bar efoot in the Oratory. E) About the Angelic S ummons The day following the consecr ation of the altar, before dawn, get up early. Do not proceed as u sual, with lu stral ablu tio ns. Dress in Vestm ents of m ourning, and, barefo ot, enter the Oratory. Take som e coals from the Censer from the previous evening and m ark the forehead and hair with ash. Now place fres h coals in the C enser th en, return ing to the thresho ld, prostrate yourself, face to the ground, fists crossed beneath the head, which is covered with a black veil. Here the ritu al of Abramelin p resc ribes a rite, which is not found in that of the “Illum ined of Avignon” nor the Elus-Cohen. However, it appears in an analogous ritual of “Mystic Masonry”. “The m orning following the Consecration, ri se at an early hour. Do not wash; dress in clothes of m ourning; enter the Oratory barefoot. Go to the side of the Censer, and take ash es from it, placing th em on the head. Light the L amp. Place glowing coals in the Censer. Open the window; return to th e door and there prostr ate yourself, face to the ground. Have a child, 6, 7 or 8 years old at most, dressed in white, wearing a white silk veil, fine and transparent which covers the forehead do wn to the ey es, to en ter the Oratory, to place fire an d Incense in the Censer, and to kneel before the a ltar, on which one will hav e placed a s ilver Pla te . One’s own head is covered with a black veil and, hum iliating oneself with the gre ates t fervor bef ore God and His Celes tial Court, one prays the An gel to show himself to th e chil d, by giving the child a “sign” on the silver Plate . Do not look at the altar and pray w ith great fervor unt il there appears an extrao rdinary splendor, accom panied by an inde scribab le od or. Then the child will see the Angel. Then pray the Angel to “sign” and to write the sig n of its “summons” on the silve r Pla te, togethe r with all the ins tructions necessary to its future appearance. Then the 11 0"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan Angel disappears, but the splendor rem ains. The child must carry the s ilver Plate . Then exit the Oratory, leav ing the window open and th e Lam p lit. Do not enter the room again that day; speak to nobody, and avoid repl ying, even to the child whom one now dism isses”. This is ev ide ntly r eferrin g to a real C hild , analogous to that (or rather to those), used by Cagliostro as a m edium to detect sym bolic scenes in his celebrated crystal decanter filled with m agnetized wa ter, which he then interpreted. But it is pro bable th at th e child in qu estion m ust be “prepared” according to an appropriate ritual. The child m ust be pure, bot h morally and physically. That is to say, in warm er countries (the Ritual com es m ainly from Arabic inspirati on), there would be no question of a young boy or girl of 8 having alre ady lost their physical virginity, taking into account their ultra-preco cious education. Above all, the c hild must be gifted with a natural ability to ‘see’ , or be – like those used by Cagliostro – plunged into somnambulistic s leep . Here the silver plate perform s the offi ce of a “m agic m irror”, and it is probable that this Plate should be poured out, cut a nd consecrated acco rding to an appropriate ritu al. It is p robab le that the pr im itive text e nvisaged a s imple visualization , - in this “m irror”, - o f the Angel’s seal, an image that the child m ust then describe to the M aster conducting the Operation. The day following this cerem ony, if one has singularly benefited from the appearan ce of a lum inescent “g lory” and the pe rception of an extra-te rre strial odo r, then continue the cerem ony in the m anner described below. Before daybreak go to the Oratory, light the Censer and thro w a large pinch of Incense on the glowing coals. Once m ore, in m ourning Vestm ents, head covered with a black veil, prostrate yourself at the entrance and ask the Lord God to grant you a vision of the Holy Angels. Pray that the Ce lestia l Sp irits will gr ant yo u their intimate pr esence . This prayer should continue (repeated or cont inued in a variety of ways) for about two or three full hours. At m idday, one should pray for another hour. In the evening, at sunset, another hour. One fasts all day, on ly taking food when the Sun sets. When the third day has f inally arrived, havi ng bathed or washed all ov er, enter the Oratory, ba refoot, then light and f ill the Censer with coa ls and Incense. K neeling b efore the altar give thanks to the Lord of Heaven, asking him for the help of the Holy Angels in the Magical Operation being perform ed. Th en, the Angel set over you as your guardian will f inally a ppear.

W hoeve r has the least doubt ab out the value of his interior work, and the value of the Wand, is dim inished in the sam e proportion. The sym bolism of the almond is as follo ws. It is the “wood of Angels” for the Kabbalists of yore. Now, the Hebrew word “ shaked ” signifies “alm ond” and the Hebrew word “ shakad ” denotes “watcher”. A nd this distinction (of shaked from shakad ) can only be found in Hebrew which uses m asoretic point s. In ancient mystic Hebrew the sam e word is written Shin-Heh-Kaph ( khw ), so it would be im possible to distinguish the nuance except by reason of an esoteric oral Tradition, properly called the Kabbalah . The “alm ond” ( shaked ) is the tree of “those-who-watch” ( shakad ), that is to say the Angels, whom the Book of Enoc h calls the “Watchers of Heaven”. It is the W and the Gods of the Armies of Heaven , Elohim Tzabaoth, required of Priests. In herm etic sym bolis m, the alm ond is the sym bol of Birth, earthly Birth as well as celestial Birth. Hence the candl es at baptism . Its fruit easily evokes the f eminine sex, containing the future seed: the Child. It is the tre e of the Virg in Mothe r, and Mary is often depicted in the m iddle of an almond (see Notre Dam e of Paris), because she is the Virgin Mother, and because she is also the “Queen of the Angels”, the Queen of the Watchers of Heaven. Finally, with its silver foliage and its green fruit, it is th e Venusian-Lunar tree par excellence. For Jewish Kabbalis ts o r Arab Ma gicians it evok es the St ar of David; and the Pentagram (linked to the color green), whic h surmounts the Crescent m oon (linked to the color silver). It is the si gn of Chance and Good Fortune. But above all the alm ond tree is the tree, which seeks the light . Frequently blossom ing during Spring, before the last frosts have passed, it hastens to see the solar reb irth in rea lizing th e sym bol of the Sage who confronts death with no fear, in or der to sooner see the hoped-for Life. All other appropriate m ateri als, apart from the Silver Plate, can be used to advantage: notably the plat e of virgin wax, virgin lam bskin or veal skin, etc... The im pregnation of a “seal” upon a m aterial body is described in the Old Testam ent: this is the ep isode of the “Tablets of the Law”. “When the Eternal One had finished talk ing to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of Testim ony, Tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.” (Exodus: 31:18). “Moses returned and went down from Mount Sinai, and the two Tablets of ‘Testim ony’ were in his hand. The two Tabl ets were written on both their sides, they were written on one and on the other side. The T ablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of G od, engraven upon the Tablets. 82 ” (Exodus: 32:15).   82 These two quotations a pproximate the Ki ng Jam es Versi on, but Am bel ain adde d words to em phasi ze hi s poi nt, whi ch a re n ot in the bible – P V. 11 7"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Va ughan It would be wrong to see in these stone Tablets, written by the very finger of the Elohim whom Moses contem plated on the m ountain, a legislative tex t , summarizing the long prescriptions that God gave in a liv ing voice to his representative. These prescriptions cover twelve Chapters of Exodus, and are then repeated m any tim es. It would also b e futile to se e in th is jus t the engr avin g of the Ten Comm andments, f or the holy text is very precise on this m atter, and it is im agination on the part o f the exegetes who believed they saw this passage as bei ng about the ten prim ary prescriptions: in reality it is about som ething com pletely different! In Chapter 25 of Exodus, paragraphs 16 and 17, the Eternal One, having given His instructions for th e construction of the Ark of the Covena nt , a little bo x of two and a half cubits long, one and a half cubi ts tall and w ide, says the following: “Thou shalt put into the Ark the ‘Tes tim ony’, that which I shall give thee.” Now, we ha ve seen above that the ‘Testim ony’ in question is the two Tablets. Why this ex pression ? Because these stone pl aqu es, for Moses and the People, will be preem ptory and decisive proof of the reality of the miracle ! In contem plating these Tablets, Mo ses will n ever aga in the reaf ter, desp ite the p assag e of tim e, doubt the foundation of his m ission, and of his souvenirs! Never will he be able to dream that he dream ed the m agic! The ‘Tablets’ will be there, as witness, w ith th e super natura l im print that they received, th at Yahweh truly m anifest ed before the face of the leader of Israel. The text of Exodus tells us that they were “written on both sides”. This gives us Ten Comm andm ents, distributed over four side s! This is neither easy nor harm onious. But if one adm its that they were two stone Pentacles , all becom es clear. For all Pentacles have two sides, both engr aved with the appropriate symbols. If two “Tablets” were necessary, that is to say, a double “W itness”, it is b ecause, as we are told in Genesis (C hapter 1), Elohim is a ‘double’ God: “God m ade Man in his im age, m ale and fem ale created he th em ”. Here we see the expre ssions of God’s “right” and “left”. This duality is recalled by the two Cherubim who, in the words of Chapter 25 of Exodus (18, 19), m ust spread their wings above the Ark, and the pure gold Mercy Seat, which dom inates it. And the proof that the pres ence of the Eternal One, the God of Israel, is linked to the two ‘Pentacles’, which are the tw o ‘Tablets’, is also in Exodus, which tells us: “And Thou shalt put the Mercy-seat above and upon the Ark; and in the ark thou shalt p lace the ‘Testim ony’ that I sh all g ive thee. And there I will mee t with thee, a nd I will commune with thee from above the Me rcy-seat, from between the tw o Cherubim which are u pon the Ark of the ‘Testimony’, of all things which I will g ive thee in commandme nt unto the children of Israel .” (Exodus 25:22). The sequel to this prescription was that the v ery m any places of cult wors hip tha t the people and the indolent Kings allowed to occur or persist thr oughout the territory of 11 8"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Since, for them , the God of Israel coul d only be m anifest at Jerusa lem , in the Holy o f Holies, above the Ark of the Covenant, containing the famous “Testimony”... For, there w here is the A rk, is th e Elo him : “Thou shalt m ake m e a sanctuary, and there sh all I live, in the m idst of you...” * * * This traditional pr escription, im plying a “support for manifestation” for the Deity evoked, is comm on to all m agical cerem onies, whatever the tradition: W estern, E astern, ancien t, m edieval, m odern. This is th e r ole of the “ mandalas” and “yantr as” , which is th e sam e as f or “pentacles” or “circles”. This is why the “Sacred Magic of Abram elin the Mag e” an ticipates the necessary presence of a Plaque of pure silver, impregna ted and “signed” by the Angel, as a first condition to all subsequent m anifestation. We will f ind this ru le in the trad ition in which the “Grim oires” were writte n, on virgin parchm ent in the Operator’s own ha nd, and that the demons thus evoked im posed their “signature: upon each of the pages attrib uted to them . There, Sorcery, Magic and Theurgy were joined together, in a com plete ritual identification. * * * Regarding the special role reserved, in certain sacerdotal functions, to young children, here is what the “Book of Ju dges” tells us further (17:1 to 6 83 ): “And there was a m an of m ount Ephraim , whose nam e was Micah. And he said unto his m other, the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursest, and spakest of also in m ine ears, behold, the silver is with m e; I took it. And his mother said, blesse d be thou of the Lord, m y son.   “And when he had restored the eleven hundr ed shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from m y hand for m y son, to make a grav en image and a molten image : now theref ore I will r esto re it unto th ee. Yet he restored the m oney unto his m other; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who m ade thereof a graven im age and a m olten im age: and they were in the house of Mica h. And the m an Micah had a house of gods, 83 Ori ginal tex t read s: “1 to 8 ” – PV . 11 9"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R . Ambelain (19XX) . trans. Pi ers A. Va ughan and m ade an ephod, and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest . “In those days there was no king in Israel , but every m an did that which was right in his own eyes.” * * * And so we see from the preced ing text that Mica h used one o f his child ren as an “interm ediary” between him self and the entity w hich he ve nerated. Th is entity was figured in an Oratory (“And the m an Micah ha d an house of gods”, that is, a chapel) by means of two different objects; one carved and the other cast. Here, too, the m etal used was silver. It acted as a double re presentation; there were two teraphim , just as there were tw o Cherubim , and two Tablets of “Testim ony”. One of the teraphim was m ale: th is is the one, w hich was car ved , thus recalling the modeling of Ada m, the First Man, by the very hands of the Eternal One. T he other teraphim wa s poured, recalling the creation of Eve, the W oman, issued from Ada m by dividing into two. The first teraphim wa s evidently the m ould for the second one. So we m ay conclude that, in the “Ritua l of Abram elin the Mage”, the child is a real infant, and it is not nece ssa ry to investig ate, with th e aid of Ge matria, Tem urah or Notariqon, what other nam e, of equivalent Kabbalistic and num eric value, could be concealed in this im age. W e need no longer im agine that the child and th e pentacle (b oth em ble matic of “ mediators ” between the Evoked and the Evok er) as anything but a single, united accessory.

And the fruit of righteousness is sown in p eace of them that make p eace.” Epistle of Jam es, 3.17 – 18 Observation of Men has revealed a peculi ar asp ect of their nature, which shows that am ong them Laziness is the m other of all Vices. This can be explained by the fact that the ref usal of the Flesh to par ticipate in the dem ands of the works of the Spir it, inexorab ly leads to the g enera tion within th em of contrary elem ents, which are open to bette r se rve this sham eful defect. Therefore one can understand that that the Soul thus invaded by such a Vice (the manifestation of an intelligent Principle whic h is conscious of its perverseness), is going to be open to the invasion of other vices, wh ich the f irst one which f orce d entry will call to assist it, in order to preserve the stronghold it has just gained. But if this pr ocess can on ly be expressed in an inverse m anner, a natural process of generatio n of the Soul’s attributes, it is because the Soul exists by itself, and, in consequence, the Virtues of the Soul are open to harm onic manifestation and developm ent, their bloom ing forth and their perm anence dependent upon their com pleteness. So, just as in an edifice o ne stone calls fo r another, and just as two require a third, and so on until the f inal placing of th e “key ”, in the sam e way a Virtue a nd a Vice generate other Principles, and so on up to the opposition of the final whole.

They are Earth, Wate r, Air a nd Fire re spectiv ely. The Alchemists knew how to draw two Principles from these Four Elem ents, male and fe male respectively, and a third – Ne uter – Principle. These are Philosophical Sulfur, Philosophical Salt, and Philosophical Mercury. Thus, by m eans of a simple and salutary Opera tio n, the Mas ters te ll us, the Four are reduced to three. But Philosophical Sulfur, Mercury and Salt only constitute an inte rm ediary aspect of the evolution of our Elem ents. From thei r production are born two Principles, superior to all the o thers.

From the general practice of these tw o prim ary Virtues, Power and Prudence, are born respectively two others: Tem perance and Justice.

For Justice is: precise reward; and through a purely m echanical reaction, the m omentarily di sturbed equilibrium reestablishes itself . But when Prudence is subm erged by Power, then Tem perance appears. It is also called Mercy, Mildness, Indulgenc e and Pardon.

The Ritual below has been created by us, drawing upon the “Clavicles” and being inspired by the instruction given by L enain in his work “Kabbalis tic Sc ien ce” (Am iens, 1823). It is perfectly within the sp ecific s ecret tradition of the “Elus-Cohen”, since it aim s to esta blish f irstly a spir itua l contact and then a m aterial one, between one of the great Angels of the “Nam e of Seventy-Two Letters” and th e Operator. T his contact is im plicitly in cluded in th e secr et teac hings of Martin ez de Pas qually, and explic itly required in the great “Invoca tion of Reconciliation”, of which a m anuscript copy in S aint- Martin’s ow n hand is lodged in the Library of L yons. * * * The “Secret Teachings o f Martinez d e Pasqually”, a work by Franz von Baader, translated from the Germ an by René Philippon (C hacornac, ed. Paris, 1900), tells us that “...Martinez de Pasqually restored the fasts of the Ancient Covenant for his disciples...”. This “Covenant” was that concluded by Moses, Aaron and the seventy elders of Israel, in the nam e of the Jewish people, with one of the “Elohim ”. This is why the Ark was called the “Ark of Testim ony”, or the “Ark of the Cove nant”, for it contained the true witness to the divine manifestation. In f aithf ul witness to th is covenant, Is rael has continued to comme morate the day when it concluded this verita ble “pact” at each new m oon. The purpose of this Ritual is to realize at an indivi dual level what was done on a collective level five thousand years ago. Regular holders of the Elus-Cohen lineage are in possession, depending on their grade, of th e lineage of the Levites, of that of the Cohenim , indeed of that of the Judges (acco rding to Philippo n). And so nothing stan ds in the way of this ‘m icrocosm ic’ revival of the greatest theurgic Work known in the history of Hum anity. * * * At the beginning of all O perations, on e m ust distinguish a point of prim e im portance: accord ing to som e letters of Martin ez or his clo sest friend s, there are “passes” wh ich conf irm to the Initiator appr oval of his intention re gard ing a disc iple ’s advancem ent in grade. S imilarly, it is not the Operator who chooses his spiritual Guide, but indeed the Angel who chooses – or receives from God – the Initia te whom he is to lead, instruct and illum inate. It is only when the “Grand Master C ohen” (or “Grand Architect”) has been the recipient of m anifestations or “passes”, which perm it him to recognize th e Entity 16 4"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Pract ical Kabbalah – R .

Tradition and tim e-honored docum ents allow one to m ake this id entification, and to specify the Na me of the Entity. * * * Spiritual aw akening was begun when, as an “Elect Master, beneath the Black Band” 131 , during the first three Quarters of the Moon, he practiced the Invocation of the Twenty-Two Divine Nam es of God, derived from the Twenty-Two Letters, and given in Psalm 119 ( separate instruction gi ven to Master Elect Cohens). The active side of this sp iritual “im pregnation” was comm enc ed with the Equinox Operations, and the request for “Passes”. W e believe th at th e “passes” ob tained in consequence are sufficiently explicit, together with the counsel of Brothers of the sam e Lodge, to allow the Entity who has chosen the O perator as a disciple to be identified; and that the tim e for its Evocation has a rrived. Specialized tables give these “correspondences” (tim e, hour, astrological angle, analogical and planetary correspondence, perfume, etc...). * * * We reiterate, what follows has been test ed by us and our successes confirm its validity. Moreover, it w as the dreams, always occurring towards dawn, following nocturnal Operations of Invoking the Angel, which, by m eans of sym bolic but very clear visions, truly taught us the detail of this Ritual. We would add that coincidences, com pletely unexpected indications, or the oppos ite of what we were expecting, showed us without possible contradiction that the reactions of the Subconscious w ere not for nothing. Som e Brothers were instructed gradually from th ese revelations as the work progressed from the journals of dream s experienced the following m ornings. Finally, som e were present at abridged Operations, or the Operations’ begi nnings, with the sole purpose of convincing them of the reality a nd value of these Rituals.

Now, with the occult co nnection strongly established with the plane of Yetzirah, and with the known protecting en tity previously contacted; it then becom es possible for the Operator to penetrate into certain “pla nes” or lower “spiri tual regions” without imm ediate danger. These Operations can be divided up as follows: 1st – Evocation of Demo ns (in order to conjure their actions); 2 nd – Evocation of the Dead (with the purpose of appeasem ent); 3 rd – Evocation of the Liv ing (in order to console or m orally improve them ); 4 th – Evocation of Collectiv ities or State Egregores 134 (political a ctiv ity). One m ay be astonished to see a work of Theurgy include the m eans of evoking dem onic for ces in its procedures . In fact, the “Ritual of Abra melin” tells us that this is required in order to restore th e equilibrium of the Operator , w ho risks being disturbed – even destroyed – by the Superior Forces cont acted, as surely as by those f rom Below. One should rem ember the warnings of the Scriptures: “God is a fire W HICH BURNS...” “You cannot see m y face W ITHOUT DYING...” “Seek not the Truth too hard; why do you wish to IMMOLATE (aneantir?) yourself ?”   For com pleteness’ sake, we have decide d to indicate these four m ethods of theurg ic Action.
