[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Shem Ha-Mephoresch The 72 Fold Name "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This refers to the Se venty Two Names of the Expounded Name YHVH. Four is the number of the letters of the Tetragrammaton. Four is also the number of the letters of the name ADNI which is its representative and key. The latter name is bound with the former and united thereto, thus IAHDVNHY forming a name of 8 letters. 8 X 3, the number of the Supernal Triad, yields the 24 thrones of the Elders of the Apocalypse, each of whom wears on his head a golden crown of three rays, each ray of which is a name, each name an Absolute Idea and Ruling Power of the great name YHVH Tetragrammaton. The number 24 of the thrones multiplied by the 3 rays of the crown which equals 72, the name of God of 72 letters, which is thus mystically shown in the name YHVH, as under: (Or as the book of Revelation says: “When the living creatures (the four Kerubim the Letters of the Name) give glory to Him, etc. the four and twenty elders fall down before Him and ca st their crowns before the Throne, etc.” (that is the Crowns, which each bear 3 of the 72 Names, and these 72 names are written on the leaves of the Tree of Li fe which were for the healing of the nations.) These are also the 72 names of the ladder of Jacob on which the Angels of God ascended and descended. It will presently be shown how the 72 Angelic names are formed from the 72 Names of the Deity, and also how their signification is to be found. The 72 Names of the Deity are thus obtained. The 19th, 20th, and 21st verses of the XIV Chapter of the Book of Exodus each consist of 72 letters. (The English translation is:) 19th verse: “And the Angel of the Elohim, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them.” 20th verse: “And it came between the camp of the Eg yptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness (to th e first) but it gave light by night (to these); and the one came not near unto the other all the night.” 21st verse: “And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind a ll that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters divided.” These three verses are now to be written at length one above the other, the first from right to left, and the second from left to right, and the third from right to left; and as they contain 72 letters, there will be 72 columns of three letters each. Then each column will give a word of three letters, and there will be 72 names of three letters each, which are the Shem ha Mephoresch or 72 Names of the Deity, expounding the Powers of the name YHVH. From these names 72 Names of Angels are formed by the addition of, in some cases, the suffice YH which signifies Merc y and Beneficence, or in others of the suffice AL which signifies Severity and Judgment. Or as it is said: “And the Name is in Him, etc.” These 72 Angels rule over the 72 Quinances or sets of 50 of the Zodiac, and therefore each decanate or set of 100 of a Sign has 2 Quinances, and each sign has 3 decanates, which are again allotted to the Planets in regular order. This is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the formation as given above (e ach Angel’s name containing 5 letters and each name of Deity 3.). These then are the Schem ha -Mephoresch or 72 Angels bearing the Name of God, classed into nine sets of 8, each answering to the nine choirs of Angels, and also divided into 4 great divisions of 18 each, each divi sion under the Presidency of one of the four letters of the Name YHVH. They are further classed as belonging to the decanates of the Zodiac as follows: 2 Quinances to each decanate. The first divi sion of 3 Signs is under the Presidency of Y, the letter of Fire. The second Division of 3 signs, headed by the Watery sign Cancer, is under the Presidency of H the Letter of Water. The third division of 3 Signs headed by the Airy Si gn Libra is under the Presidency of VAU, the letter of Air. And the 4th division of 3 signs headed by the Earthy Sign Capricorn is under the Presidency of HEH fi nal, the letter of Earth. But it should be remembered that the mo st powerful rule of Y of Tetragrammaton is over the Fiery Triplicity; that of H ov er the Watery Triplicity; that of Vau over the Airy Triplicity; and that of H final over the Earthy Triplicity. In the 22nd chapter of the Apocalypse of St. John it is said that “The Tree of Life which bare Twelve manner of fruits an d yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations. And there shall be no more curse; but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it. ”This is exemplified in the drawing taken from the 3-8 Altar Di agram. The “Twelve Manner of fruits yielded every month” answer to the signs of the Zodiac and the Twelve Tribes of the Sons of Jacob. Also to the twelve apostles. The healing leaves are those of Schem ha-Mephoresch or the divided Name of Zauir Anpin, the Microprosopus, the Christ, the Lamb of Elohim, whose Thro ne is in the Tree, from which Throne issues the River of the Waters of Life."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The Seventy two leaves of the Tree of Life are Zauir Anpin or Microprosopus. Now the Twelve Sons of Jacob go down into Egypt, that is the Kingdom, Malkuth, which has been destroyed in the Fall, and cut from the Sephirotic Tree by the intersecting folds of the great Dragon who then becomes its Ruler as shown in the great Altar Diagram of the 4-7 grade. “Beh old, I am against th ee, Pharoah, King of Egypt, the great dragon thai lieth in the midst of the Rivers.” And the first of the sons of Jacob who goeth down is Joseph whose two Tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, balance each other in Chesed an d Geburah. That is to say, that there first comes down into the desolated Ea rth the combined power of Mercy and Severity. And Ephraim, the Ke rubic sign of the Ox, is th e natural ruler of Earth in Malkuth, under the power of H final of the Holy Name, the Br ide, Eve, and the Queen. And the Schem ha-Mephoresch, the 72, are found in the number of the family of Jacob’s sons is 70; and Jacob and Joseph equals 72. But the then ruling Pharoah, corresponds more to Hadar amon gst the Edomite Kings, as representing one of not so evil a tendency. Yet as the Apocalyptic symbol of the Lamb and the Airy Sign which leads off the Schem ha -Mephoresch is Chesed; one opposed to the evil symbol of the Dragon, so is every shepherd an abomination to the Egyptians, who yet are friendly with the Ox symbol, the Kerubic Ruler of Earth,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and therefore is it symbolically said by the Children of Israel that their business has been about cattle and not about sheep.
