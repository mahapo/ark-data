Oh, God my Father and Lord of all goodness, who did st create all things by Thy word, and who didst pre pare man in thy wisdom to rule over all creatures that were mad e by Thee, that he should rule over the world with holiness and righteousness, and judge with an upright heart. Giv e unto me that wisdom that is constantly around Thy throne, and cast me not out from among Thy children. For I am T hy servant and the son of Thy hand-maiden, a weak c reature of a short existence, and too weak in understanding, i n right, and in the law.

The Name of the 72 Letters In the name of the highest, almighty Creator, I, Ki ng Solomon, hold to the interpretation of the name of (God) Semiphoras, in other words, the First and the Great est, the oldest and hidden mystery of great power a nd virtue, to obtain all that which is asked of God, for God must be worshipped in spirit and in truth, which consis ts not in many and vain words, because each word and name of God i s self-existent, and therefore the name and prayer must agree, and no strange name must be used unnecessarily if a nything fearful or wonderful is intended to be acco mplished, in order that the divine quality may pour into our sou l and spirit His grace and gifts--that is the consc iousness of God in His name through which he comes near and abides wit h those who know His name. Therefore, this name mus t be held in the highest honor and should be hidden from all frivolous and unworthy persons, since God says himself in Exodus: \"Out of all places will I come unto thee an d bless thee, because thou rememberest my name.\" Th erefore have the Hebrew Maccabees seventy-two names for God , and named and wrote Schemhamphora, the name of seventy-two letters. First, it must be known that the names of God canno t be taught and understood except only in the Hebre w language, neither can we pronounce them in any other dialect, as they were revealed to us through the grace of G od. For they are the sacrament and emanation of divine omnipoten ce, not of man, nor of angels, but they are institu ted and consecrated through the (generent) of God, to insti ll divine harmony in a certain manner according to the characters of his immovable number and figure, and of which th ose that are appointed over the heavens are afraid. The angels and all creatures honor them and use them to praise their Creator, and to bless Him with the greatest reverence in His divine works, and whosoever will apply them pro perly, with fear and trembling and with prayer, wil l be powerfully enlightened by the spirit of God--will b e joined with a divine unity--will be mighty accord ing to the will of God--that he can perform supernatural things--th at he can command angels and devils--that he can bi nd and unbind the things of the elements, over which he ma y elevate himself through the power of God. Therefo re, he, who has purified and improved his understanding and mor als, and who, through faith, has purified his ears, so that he may without spurious alterations call upon the divi ne name of God, will become a house and a dwelling- place of God, and will be a partaker of divine influences, e tc., etc. On the other hand, the order of God should be known , that God makes use of other words among angels an d also others among men, but the true name of God is known neither to men nor to angels, for He has reserved it and will not reveal it until His order and exhibition are fu lfilled and perfected. After that the angels will h ave their own tongues and speech, about which we need not concern ourselves, because it is not necessary for us to e xamine them. In the third place, all the names of God are taken by us from`His works, as indicating a communication with God, or are extracted out of the divine scriptures through the art of Cabalisticam, Calculatoriam, Notariacam, and Geometriam. The Elements of Semiphoras The beginning of the name and word Semiphoras. whic h God the Creator, Jehovah, gave in Paradise, embra ces three Hebrew letters, Jehovah the inscrutable Creator of the world, almighty Providence, and all-powerful st rong Deity. After this there are four parts of the earth which are the most subtle light of the spiritual world: 4 . Hierarchus, Cherubim et Seraphim, Potestates et Virtutes, Archa ngelos et Angeles, Spiritus et Animus Hominum, whic h come before God. This part of the world has also four an gels that stand ripen the four corners of heaven; t hey are Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel; four angels stand for the elements, namely, Seraph, Cherub, Tharsis, Ariel; f our highly enlightened men full of the light of God. For the other light or part of the world is the hea ven of all the stars; has four Triplicitates of the twelve signs, under which the sun revolves yearly, making the change of seasons, the Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter of b irth and corruption, and changes the fourth element. In the third part of the work are the elements and everything that is subordinate to them, in which is the small world, man. He again has four elements within him. Anima is in the head, per nemos ; Spiritus is in the heart, and operates through the arteries; Corpus is the whole body with the veins; Genius , a spark of fire, is in the kidneys and governs birth. He has four spiritual and strong working fac ulties, as facultates actiones, or spiritus, as his Animali, Vitalis, Naturalis, Genitions. The soul has inward senses, a s sensum communene ; in which faith takes hold as fides and other senses Intellectus in the brain:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2. Imaginatrix , the imagination is another soul-operation or phan tasie, which draws a picture of power and accomplishes all things; 3. Rativtanatio repeats the Species on the mind on all causes and judgments. Scientia , if the soul will now turn to real reason, it will obtain a knowledge of all worl dly wisdom; 4. Memoratrix , the memory, retains all things which pertains to the faculties and operations of the spirit, to brin g an experimentum et Sensus, through agitation of the ne rves the increase of the human race is effected by God. The living spirit of the heart embraces within itse lf four virtues: Justitia , Temperantia , Prudentia , Fortitudo and these lie in the arterial blood and connect the sou l with the body. Appetitus Sensitivus , the natural spiritual action and power lies in the liver and arteries, and effect mo tion and attraction, support and subsistence; the p roper spirit of strength and sap lies in the kidneys ... to multipl y through divine perfection. The body has four elements, namely, spirit, fruit, flesh and bone--four complexions or temperaments, w arm, wet, dry. Attraction is produced by warmth; dryness, dam pness; rel retentio is produced by coldness and dryness; Lien Cactio by warmth and wet; id est rtomachus , four wet: gall, blood, mucus, and melancholia. In the fourth quarter of the world there is darknes s, instituted for condemnation in wrath and for pun ishment. Four princes of devils are injurious in the four element s: Samael, Azazel, Azael, Mehazaer; four princes of devils over the four quarters of the earth: Oriens, Pagmon, Egyn, A mayon. The Seven Semiphoras The first Semiphoras is that of Adam, because he sp oke with the Creator in Paradise; The second Semiphoras, because he spoke with angels and spirits; The third, because he spoke with devils; The fourth, because he spoke with the creatures of the four elements: the birds, the fishes, the anima ls, and the creeping things of the earth; The fifth, because he spoke with inanimate objects, as herbs, seeds, trees, and all vegetation; The sixth, because he spoke with the winds; The seventh, because he spoke with the sun, moon, a nd stars. By the power of the seven Semiphoras he could creat e and destroy all he desired. The first Semiphoras was acknowledged by Adam, sinc e God created him and placed him in Paradise, where he was allowed to remain only seven hours. The name is lov e, which name must be pronounced only in the greate st need, and then only with the most devout feelings toward the Creator. In this case you will find grace and s ure help. The second Semiphoras, in which Adam spoke with ang els, and which gave him the expression, yeseraye , that is, God without Beginning and without End, must be pron ounced when speaking with angels, and then your que stions will be answered and your wishes fulfilled. The third Semiphoras, in which Adam spoke with the spirits of the departed, and inquired of them, who gave him satisfactory answers upon the word, Adonay Sabaoth, cadas adonay amara . These words must be uttered when you wish to collect winds, spirits, or demons: Aly, Ado y, Sabaoth, amara. The fourth Semiphoras: Layamen, lava, firin, lavagellayn, tavaquiri, Lavag ola, Lavatasorin, Layfialafin, Lyafaran . With this name he bound and unbound all animals and spirits. The fifth Semiphoras: Lyacham, Lyalgema, Lyafarau, Lialfarah, Lebara, Leb arosin, Layararalus . If you wish to bind equals, as trees and seeds, you must pronounce the above words. The sixth Semiphoras is great in might and virtue: Letamnin, Letaylogo, Lestasynin, Lebaganaritin, Let arminin, Letagelogin, Lotafalosin . Use these when you desire the elements or winds t o fulfil your wishes. The seventh Semiphoras is great and mighty. They ar e the names of the Creator, which must be pronounce d in the beginning of each undertaking: Eliaon yoena adonay cadas ebreel, eloy ela agiel, a yoni, Sachado, essuselas eloym, delion iau elynla, delia, yazi, Zazael, paliel man, umiel, onela dilatan saday alma paneim alym, canal deus Usami yaras calipix calfas sasna saffasaday aylata panteo mel auriel arion phaneton secare panerionys emanual Joth Jalaph amphia, than demisrael mu all le Leazyns ala phonar aglacyei qyol paeriteron theferoym barimel, jael haryon ya apiolell echet . These holy names pronounce at each time in reverenc e toward God, when you desire to accomplish somethi ng through the elements or something connected therewi th, and your wishes will be fulfilled, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, for God will be with y ou because you know his name. The following is another name of Semiphoras which G od gave to Moses in seven parts. The first is, when Moses concealed himself and spok e with God, when the fire burned in the forest with out consuming it; The second, as he spoke with the Creator on the mou ntain; The third, when he divided the Red Sea and passed t hrough with the whole people of Israel, etc.;"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The fourth, when his staff was turned into a serpen t which devoured the other serpents; The fifth, are the names which were written on the forehead of Aaron; The sixth, when he made a brazen serpent and burned the golden calf to divert pestilence from the Isra elites; The seventh, when manna fell in the wilderness and when water gushed from the rock. In the first are the words which Moses spake as he went on the mountain, when he spoke to the flames o f fire: Maya, Affaby, Zien, Jaramye, yne Latebni damaa yrsano, no y lyloo Lhay yly yre Eylvi Zya Lyelee, Loate, lidel oy eyloy, mecha ramethy rybifassa fu aziry scihiu rite Zeloha be vete hebe ede neyo ramy rahabe ( conoc anuhec ). If you pray this word to God devoutly, your undertaking will be fulfilled without a doubt. In the second are the words which God spake to Mose s as he went on the mountain: Abtan, Abynistan, Zoratan Juran nondieras, potarte faijs alapeina pognij poda ij sacroficium . In these words the prophet spoke to the angels with whom the four quarters of the earth are sealed , through which the temple was founded Bosale. If y ou wish to pronounce these you should fast three days, be chas te and pure, and then you can perform many wonders. In the third are words which Moses spake in order t o divide the Red Sea: Oua claiie saijec holomomaatl ; bekahn aijclo inare asnia haene hieha ijfale malieha arnij a aremeholona queleij. Lineno feijano, ijoije malac habona nethee hijcere . If you have lost favor of your master, or if you wish to gain the goodwill of some one, speak these words with fervor and humility, etc. In the fourth are words which Moses spake when he c hanged his staff into a serpent: Micrato, raepijsathonich petanith pistan ijttn ijer hijgarin ijgnition temay ron aijcon dunsnas castes Lacias astas ijecon cijna caihera natu facas . Pronounce these names when you wish to have your desires fulfilled. In the fifth are the written names of the forehead of Aaron as he spake with the Creator: Sadaij haijlves Lucas elacijus jaconi hasihaia ijein ino, sep, actitas ba rne lud doncnij eija iehhu reu, vaha, vialia, eije. Vie haija hoij asaija salna hahai, cuci ijaija. Elenehel, na vena, setna . The names are powerful in satisfying each request . In the sixth are names which were written upon the staff of Moses when he made the brazen serpent and broke the golden calf: Tane mare syam, abijl ala, nuno, hija actenal tijog as ijano, eloim ija nehn ijane haij ijanehn, ahijac o mea . With this name destroy all sorcery and evil. You must not pronounce it with levity in your works. In the seventh are words which Moses employed in le ading the Israelites out of Egypt, with which he br ought manna from heaven, and caused the water to flow from the rock: Sadaij amara elon pheneton eloij eneij ebeoel messi as ijahe vehu hejiane, ijanancl elijon . Pronounce these words when you desire to do somet hing wonderful, or when you are in great need, and call earnestly on God, etc. Prayer Oh, thou living God; thou great, strong, mighty, ho ly, and pure Creator full of mercy--a blessed Lord of all things; praised be thy name. I implore Thee, fulfil my desi re. Thou canst work. Permit us to accomplish this w ork. Grant us thy grace and give us thy divine blessing, that we may happily fulfil this work. Thou holy, merciful, and gracious God, have mercy upon us. Thy name, Jeseraire, be ad ored forever and ever. Amen. In the name of the Almighty Creator, I, Solomon, ho ld to the declaration of the divine names: Agla. Th ou art a mighty God to all eternity. He who bears upon his p erson this name, written upon a gold plate, will ne ver die a sudden death. Ararita--a beginning of all Unity. Ah en--thou solid rock, united with the Son. Amen. Tho u Lord, a true king, perfect it. The Names of Semiphoras The names consist of the beginning of the chapters Adonay, which the Hebrews made use of instead of th e unutterable name, Asser Eserie. The seven mighty names may be obtained at a favorab le hour and place: Comiteijon, sede aij, throtomas, sasmagata, bij ijl ijcos . The four names of the Creator: Jva, Jona, eloij, Jeua . He who calls often upon God in faith and with fea r, and carries with him the golden letters, will never wan t for an honorable subsistence and good clothing. T he name which Adam uttered at the entrance to hell is mephenaij phaton . He who bears this name with him is unconquerable. The name which God communicated to Moses on Mount S anai, Hacedion , will put away all causes for sorrow. The name which Joshua prayed when the sun stood sti ll, baahando heltsloir, dealzhat , brings vengeance upon enemies. The ten names of [the] Sephiroth, I, Salomon, spoke in my prayer to God, and he gave me wisdom: Ethor, Hoehmal, binach, baesed. Geburah, thipheret, nezath, hod Jeh od malchut . Now follow the ten names of God: Eseie, Jod teragrammaton, Tetragrammaton Saboth, el ohim Sabaoth, Sadaij Adonaij nulech , all with ten letters. Tetragrammaton Vedath have eight letters. Ehoie , the self-existence of God, Arerite Aser, ehele, the names of God of seven lett ers."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Eseh , used by Moses as the fire of God, Elion has five letters and they are all Hebrew characters. Emeth, the true God, is God's seal. The explanation of the ten names of God and the ten Sephiroth, is given in Agrippa De occults Philosophia , Lib. 3, Cap. 10. • Hacaba , the holy and adored God; • Hu , himself the power of the Deity; • Hod , Jod , a divine being; • Iah , a just God, comparing himself with man; • Inon ; • Jesuba , the Messiah will come in the golden age; • Jaua , he who created the light; • Isaia , with the name El , resembles the changed era (each made up of 31); • Mettatron for Sadai , each name composed of 314; • Icuru Maapaz , both names are derived from a transposition of th e name Jehova ; • Messiah is derived from a transposition of the letters in Jisma Macom ; • Na , the name of God, should be used in tribulation an d oppression; • Oromasim , Mitrim , Araminem , signify God and the Spirit; these are three princ es of the world; • Pele , he who worketh wonders. These names must be selected out of each letter con stituting the work, for the accomplishment of which the help of God should be implored. Similar to a certain text, in Exodus xiv, consisting of three verses which are always written with seventy-two letters, beginning`with the three words Vaijsa, Vaiduo, Vaiot , which, when placed in a line, one and three, from left to right, the middle one trans posed from the right to the left, as in a reverse o rder, constitutes one name, the seventy-two letters of which are named Schemhamphoras . If now the divine names, El or Jod , are added, there will be seventy-two names Of God , each of them syllables, for it is written: My angel goeth before me, behold him, f or my name is in him. These are seventy-two deacons of the five departments of heaven, there are so many nations an d tongues, so many bodily functions, working with t he seventy- two disciples of Christ. And this is one method whi ch Cabalists use in making up these names. Another method to make the Schemhamphoras is when t he three verses are written in regular order from r ight to left subalternatim, without selecting this method from t he tables of Zimph, or as it is selected from the T able Commutationem: Vehuiah, Jeliel, Sitael, Elemiah, Mahasia, Lehahel, Achuiah, Cahetel, Haziel, A ladiah, Laviah, Caliel, Leuniah, Pahaliah, Nelchael, Leiaiel, Melahel, Hahuiah, Mit taiah, Haaiah, Jerathel, Scehia, Rauel, Omael, Lecabel Vasarias, Jehujah Labahiah Chaua kiah Mahadel Aniel Haamiah, Richael, ieiazcl hahael Michael, Vehuel, Daniel, Hahasias Imamiahs, Nanael, Nitael, Behahia, Poiel Nemamiah, Selalel, Harael, Mizrael, Sahhe l, Annanuel Mehael damabiah menkiel Eliapel, Habuiah, Rochel Jabamiah Haianel, Maniah. In the first period of nature God was addressed by the name of Sadai Trigrammaton . In the second period of the law he bore the unutterable name of Tetragrammaton , which is spoken Adonaij . In the period of grace he was called upon as Pentragrammaton effabile Jesu , which is also written Jusu , with four letters, and JHS with three letters. The Father gave all power to the Son, the angels re ceived heaven, but in the name of God and Jesus, wh ich is the first power in God. Afterward it spreads into the t welve and seven angels through which it was communi cated to the twelve signs and seven planets, and consequently in to all the servants and instruments of God, even to the humblest. Therefore, said Jesus: \"Everything which ye ask of the Father in my name, that will he give unto you, if ye pray unto him with a pure heart and a fervent spirit, for the re is no other name given to man whereby he can be saved but the name of Jesus.\" Amen. Of the Benefit and Use of the Semiphoras That man, who lays hold in strong faith and trust i n the first Creator, must first implore the divine help and blessing, not only wiih the lips, but also with holy gestures and humble heart, praying fervently and continuall y, that he may enlighten the mind and take away from the soul all darkness of the body. For, precisely as when our so uls are moved by some ordinary cause, so the soul moves all the m embers of the body to contribute something toward t he accomplishment of a contemplated work. Therefore, t he great Creator, when he is worshipped in spirit a nd in truth, and when no unnecessary things are asked of Him, wh en the prayer is devoutly preferred, will cause the lower order of creatures to yield obedience to the wishes of ma n, according to their state, order, and calling, fo r man was made"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"in the image and likeness of God and endowed with r eason. And working under the favor of God, he will obtain his desire through faith and wisdom: first, from the st ars and from the heavens by the rational reflection s of His spirit; second, by the animal kingdom, through his senses; third, by the elements, through his four-fold body. Therefore, man binds all creatures through comparis on, by calling upon the higher power, through the n ame and power which governs one thing, and thereafter throu gh the lower things themselves, etc. And now, he who desires to become master of the wor kings of the soul, must become familiar with the br der of all things, just as they are obtained by God in their p roper state, from the highest to the lowest, throug h natural connections, that he may descend as if from a ladde r. On this account the Heathens committed the error of worshipping the planets and fixed stars, not becaus e they heard but because they were moved by the pow ers which governed them and were, at the same time, impelled thereto by the influence of their founder and creat or. And in this manner, likewise, Christian nations have committed the error of paying homage to departed saints and g iving honor to the creature which belongs only to the Creator, and God is a jealous God and will not permit the wo rship of idols. The prayer of faith, therefore, in proper language, and for proper objects, is intimately related to t he name of God, from which we distend by words, from one to the oth er, following each other out of a natural relations hip. in order to accomplish something. The son, therefore, prevails upon the father that h e may support him, although the father may not do s o willingly. Still, since he is his offspring, he must calculate to maintain him. How much greater care our heavenl y Father must feel for us, if we serve him in a proper manner! He who desires the influence of the sun must not on ly direct his eyes toward it, but he must elevate h is soul-power to the soul-power of the sun, which is God himself, ha ving previously made himself equal to God by fastin g, purification, and good works, but he must also pray in the name of the Mediator, with fervent love to God and his fellow man, that he may come to the sunspirit, so t hat he may be filled with its light and lustre, whi ch he may draw to himself from heaven, and that he may become gift ed with heavenly gifts and obtain all the desires o f his heart. And as soon as he grasps the higher light and arriv es at a state of perfection, being gifted with supe rnatural intelligence, he will also obtain supernatural migh t and power. For this reason, without godliness, ma n will deny his faith in Christ and will becoine unacceptable to Go d, therewith often falling prey to the evil spirits against whom there is no better protection than the fear of the Lord and fervent love td God and man. Most people who are skilled in divine works and who possess the right to command spirits, must be wort hy by nature or become worthy by education and discipline for their calling -- must keep all their works sec ret, but may not conceal it from a true ad pious person. Dignity of birth comes from station, but it is due to Satu rnum, Sol, Mercurium, or Martem that he is made prosperous -- that he is learned in Physics, Metaphysics, and The ology. The Ten Sephiroth If a man has a knowledge of God as the first great cause, he must also acknowledge other causes or coo perative spirits and determine what official station of dign ity and honor to accord to them, and without which knowledge their presence and help cannot be enjoyed. Such hon or and dignity must not be shown for the sake of th e spirits but for the sake of their Lord, whose servants they are . In this manner the angels of God will encamp arou nd those who fear and love the Lord, and, as Augustinus says, \"E verything possesses a predestined angel-power.\" For this reason the Hebrew theologians -- Mecubaes and Cabalists -- named ten principle divine names as members of God and ten Numerations or Sephiroth as raiment and instruments of the Creator, through which he is infused into a ll his creatures according to the order of the ten Angelic and ten princely spirit-choirs from which all thin gs derive their power and quality. 1. The name EHEIE ( aser Eheie ), its number Cether elion (one Lord), is the simplest Deity, which no eye ha s seen, is ascribed to God the Father, gives influenc e through the order Seraphin haiath heiadosch (gate of holiness or of life), that transmits life to everyt hing through Elieic. From this he flows in through premum mohele so that all things must exist -- that the heavens must revolve every twenty-four hours. This wonderful being is called Intelligentia, Mettatron , a prince of faces. His office is to lead others i nto the presence of the Sovereign, and through him God spak e to Moses. 2. JEHOVAH ( Jod, vel Jah ), his number Chochma (wisdom): The Deity full of spirit.

H is particular Intilligcntia, Raphael , was the representative of Isaac and of the youthf ul Tobias, and Pehel was the representative of Jacob. 7. TETRAGRAMMATON SABAOTH, or Adonaij Sabaoth , the God of Hosts. His number is Nezaeh (triumph and victory). To him is accorded the right pillar and signifies eternity, the justice of God, and avenger. He flows in through the order of Principatum or through the Hebrew Elohem, that is, God in Sphaeram Veneris (love and justice). He produces all Vegetable grow th and his peculiar Intelligentia, Hamel , and the angel Cernaiul , David's representative. 8. ELOHIM SABAOTHI, God of Hosts, not of war or wrath, but of pity, for he has both names and goes before his hosts. His number is called Had , that is, honorable confession, ornament, and reno wn.

Messiae See also the Formation of the Sephiroth and the Ord er of Angels. The Nine Choirs of Angels Divide Theology into Three Hierarchies In the first hierarchy are the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Throni. These, more than celestial spirits, are called gods or the sons of the gods because they continually behol d the order of divine providence. Being foremost in the goodness of God, they praise Him unceasingly and pray for us ; the second, in the being of God, according to for m; and the third, in the wisdom of God, stand continually befo re God. In the middle hierarchy are the Dominationes, Potes tates, [and] Virtutes as spirits of intelligence to rule the whole world. The first command what the others perform. T he second steer that which interfere with the laws of God. The third oversee the heavens and occasionally perform great wonders. These six orders of spirits are neve r sent upon the earth. In the lower hierarchy are the Principatus, Archang eli et angeli, which are ministering spirits to ove rsee earthly affairs. The first, in general, provide for princes and magi strates, and care for kingdoms and countries, each in his own especial sphere, as Moses declares in his song (Deu t. xxxii, 8): \"When the Most High divided to the na tions their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the numb er of the children of Israel.\" And Daniel says (x. 13): \"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me tw enty-one days. And Jesus Sirach bears witness, that each nation ha s its angel as a director.\" Therefore did the Roman s at all times invite the angel of their country. The second are engaged in divine affairs, institute and regulate the worship of God among all men, and present the prayers, offerings, end piety of men to God. The third order all things of minor importance, and each one is appointed as a protector to every man. For this reason the fourth hierarchy are added to t he former as the souls of heavenly bodies -- Animae Corporum Colestium, the souls of Hervos, vel Heroas, and of the Martyrum. They first control the light and the influence of the strong so that their power may proceed from God to the lower regions. The second are the chosen souls of the redeemed. The third are the souls of the innocent m artyrs and followers of God who offered up their li ves, amid pain and suffering, out of love to God. Since God the Father gave to the Son -- our Mediato r, Savior, and Redeemer -- all power in heaven and on earth, and the angels of the great name of God and Jesus, which is the firstmight in God, it flows accordingl y into the twelve angels and twelve signs, through which it sp reads into the seven planets and, as a natural cons equence, into all other servants and instruments of God, until it penetrates into the lower regions, so that even an insignificant herb may develop a peculiar power, even if if is decayed , and so the angel of man appears before God at all times, bearing his prayers into his presence. Without the name of Jesus the old Hebrew cabalists can accomplish nothing in the present day, with [th e] old arts as they were used by the[ir] Fathers. Therefore it is that all creatures fear and honor him. All men who believe in him"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"are enlightenid through his brightness, our souls a re united with him, and the divine power emanating from him is communicated to us. Of the Movement of the Heavenly Powers The first course in Mundo Ceolesti watches day and night -- Primum Mobile Rechet Hagallalim -- it continues from morning until night. From these the Heathens divide d the angels into thirty-three orders. The first gr eat light communicates light, life, and station out of the fi rst course, and opposes others in the Saphaera Zodi aci, causes summer and winter, [and] the spring of all the thin gs of the elements. Hebrew Masloth goes from evening to morning according to the twelve signs of the heaven s. But even if all things have their existence from Go d, the great First Cause, we should not despise oth er causes, according to changes in time, in the year, in the m onth, day, and hour. Neither should we regard these causes exclusively and forget God, for in this manner heat hen idoltry was instituted. For this reason God doe s not regard time because it robs him of his honor. For the heat hens experienced that the heavenly spirits were not united with their bodies, as our souls are united with our bodi es, but they could rejoice in the presence of God a nd prepare their bodies without much labor to work with the lower cr eatures of God. They regarded the celestial spirits as gods and conferred divine honors upon them. Very often [cert ain] Jews turned away from God and worshipped the h ost of heaven and, therefore, the wrath of God was kindled against them. But on account of the order of all t hings, God has set them before us as his instruments and which we, on account of their honorable office, are to regar d as the noblert creation of God and that we should honor them, next to God. according to their station, not as gods bu t as creatures, which he has appointed as twelves princes over the twelve gates of heaven, that they may admit what th ey received from the divine name, transposed twelve times. Ezekiel writes: \"The laws of the twelve tribes of I srael were thus written, and God Tetragrammaton rul es over them.\" Thus it is written in Revelations that the s tones in our heavenly city are planted in the groun d, or that the Church of Christ is represented by the twelve names of the Apostles, including twelve angels and of th em the name of Jesus, who received all the power of the Father so that the heavens will receive what the angels gi ve to them, according to the will of God. If, then, an Intelligentia is ascribed to each heav en, each Star and department of heaven must have a distinct and separate power and influence and, therefore, must a lso have a distinct Intelligentiam. Therefore, ther e are twelve princes of angels, who represent the twelve signs o f the Zodiac; thirty-six, who represent so many Dec uriis; and seventy-two angels, who represent so many Quinariis of heaven, of the seventy-two nations and language s of man. Likewise, seven angels of the hosts for the seven h eavens of the seven planets to rule the world, etc. Also, four angels who represent the Triplicitatibus of the twe lve signs of the Zodiac and the four elements.¹ All of these have their names and signs which the p hilosophers used in their works, signs, images, clo thes, mirrors, rings, cards, [and] wax-figures, as if they had a s un-work before them, and they called them the names of the sun and his angels, and likewise of others, etc. In the third place they designated the lowest angel s as servants. These they distributed over the worl d and named them after the seven planets, and these have their special course after the four elements and after th e four parts of the air and earth -- of the daytime several Diurnos, se veral Nocturnos, [and] several Merailianos, not tha t they are subordinate to the influence of the stars as the bo dy which they represent, but that they are more nea rly related to the star-body-kind-time than others, otherwise they mig ht be everywhere, as each human being has three ang els, for God has ordained that each human being shall have h is good angel as a protector, who also strengthens the spirit and urges and exhorts us to what is good and commendabl e, that we may fly from what is fati malignitatem. And so every man has also an evil spirit, who controls the desires of the flesh and awakens the lusts of the heart. Between these two angels there is a constant strugg le for supremacy, and to whichever man gives the pr eference, he will receive the victory. If the evil angel triumph s, then man becomes his servant; should the good an gel prove the stronger, then he will cleanse the soul and save ma n from destruction. The angel and his impulses come from the stars. In the third place are the Genii of man who govern birth and are joined to each perfection in man. The se are recognized from the star, which is the Lord of the births. The Chaldeans seek this Genium in the sun a nd moon. Astronomers would have the good Genium out of the e leventh house which, on this account, they call bonum Genium (the evil one [comes] out of the sixth house), but each one will learn to know him through natural inclination, to which everyone was inclined from hi s youth. On this account he is called the birth-ang el, who is sent into the world by God. Of this the Psalmist says, \" Thou hast made the spirit of man as a flame of fire ,\" for experience teaches us that the flame of fire and th e spirit of birth may be separated without injury t o man, that we can learn hidden things from him if he is good and true. But he is powerless over the members of birth if, however, a virgin or a companion becomes marriageable, he may be liberated from the glass and our time of life wi ll be extended."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"_____________ ¹See also Precession as it Relates to the Sophia of Jesus. Man's Divine Character God has endowed man with a divine character, throug h the number Phahad , the left-hand sword of God, through which man becomes a curse to all creatures. And the n again he has another character in the number of G od, Hesed , the right-hand sceptre of God. through which he fin ds favor in the sight of God and all his creatures. An evil conscience is the judge of men, but a good conscien ce is his happiness. Therefore, through the other d ivine numbers, and through the angels and stars, a man becomes imp ressed with signs and characters of conscience whic h cause him to be happy at one time and unhappy at another. On this account, if a man has committed murder, the ft, or any other act which his conscience condemns, he can be brought to a confession of his guilt through persis tent calling upon the name of God, for his Conscien ce will then give him no rest until he returns what he has stole n or until he has suffered the punishment due to hi s crime. Therefore, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, take three small pieces of wood from the d oor-sill over which the thief passed in leaving the place where h e committed the theft, place them within a wagonwhe el, and then through the hub of the wheel say the following word s: \"I pray thee, thou Holy Trinity, that thou mayes t cause A, who stole from me, B, a C, to have no rest or peace until he again restores [to] me that which he has stolen.\" Turn the wheel round three time and replace it again on the wagon. Nevertheless, all pious Christians, who have any re gard for their future happiness, should carefully a void all superstitious matters and should beware of using th e holy name of God unworthily, holding it in the gr eatest reverence lest they bring upon themselves eternal p unishment. If a man knows himself and realizes that he is created in the Image and likeness of God, he will acknowled ge God the Creator before all things, and afterward the world and all its creatures. From the high spirits, angel s, and the heavens, he has his portion. and from th e elements, animals, vegetation, and stones, he has within hims elf.everything that he desires to obtain. If a man knows how to appropriate the particular pl ace, time, order, bulk, proportion, and mental orga nization of anyone, he can attract and draw them, just as a mag net attracts iron, but he must first be prepared, j ust as the magnet must be fashioned by the file and charged with elec tricity. To this end, the soul must first be purifi ed and dedicated to God through faith -- a pure heart and constant j oy in the spirit are requisites. He must possess lo ve to God and his fellow-man, and then he may arrive at a perfect sta te and become like unto the Son of God. He will bec ome united with God and will once more be like him. It is not given to angels nor to any creature to unite with G od, but only to man, and he may become his son; and when this takes place, so that he overcomes himself, he overcomes and can draw to him all other creatures and command their o bedience. But our spirit, word, and act have no power in magi c and knowledge if they are not everywhere strength ened by the word of God, which we should hear often. We must pr ay to God without ceasing [and] live a sober, tempe rate, and unstained life. We must live in a continual state o f repentance, give alms, and help the poor, for Chr ist has not said in vain, \"Make unto you friends with the unrighteou s Mammon, so that he will receive you into eternal habitations\" - - that is, apply your wealth and abundance to the s upport of the poor, that they may receive their dai ly bread from you and be satisfied. Christ says, \"What ye have do ne unto the least of mine, that have ye also done u nto me.\" These are the friends that will lead us to a divine abode in heaven, where we shall receive a thousandfold a nd life eternal. On the other hand, there are others who will be rej ected, for Christ also says, \"I was hungry and thir sty and ye gave me no meat and drink -- depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, into outer darkness.\" Therefore, by fasting, praying, giving alms, [and] preparing the souls of the believing for the temple , we may become co-heirs of heavenly gifts, which the Most H igh will confer upon us in this life if we know how to use them properly. Since all things have their life and being from God , so the proper name of everything was taken from t he being of that thing, and all things derive an influence from the Creator, if they have been appropriately named , for as God brings forth all things through the influence of he aven and the operation of the planets, even so the names of all things have been given in accordance with some qual ity of the thing named by him who counts the stars. And thus God led all creatures to Adam in order to have them named, and their names indicated some peculiar qua lity or part possessed by each. Therefore, each name that has a meaning shows, by comparison with the heavenly infl uence, an inherent qualification of the object, although it i s frequently changed. When, however, both meanings of the name harmonize, then the willpower and natural power bec ome identical. Moreover, the celestial office to wh ich man is ordained by God endows him with [the] power to pond er life, and tells him what to encourage, what to e levate, what to suppress in his cause Sphaera, and to perform wo nderful works with full devotion toward God, etc. What Man Receives from the Order of Angels"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Man becomes strengthened with wonderful power throu gh the order of angels, so that he declares the div ine will: • From the Seraphim, that we cling with fervent love; • from the Cherubim, enlightenment of the mind, and p ower and wisdom over the exalted figures and images, through which we can gaze upon divine thing s, etc.; • from the Thronis, a knowledge of how we are made an d constituted. that we may direct our thoughts upon eternal things; • from Dominationbius, assistance to bring into subje ction our daily enemies, whom we carry with us constantly, and enabling us to attain salvation; • from Potestatibus, protection against human enemies of life; • from Virtutibus, God infuses strength into us, enab ling us to contend against the enemies of truth, an d reward that we may finish the course of our natural life; • from Principatibus, that all things become subject to man, that he may grasp all power and draw unto himself all secret and supernatural knowledge; • from Archangelis, that he may rule over all things that God has made subject to him -- over the animal s of the field, over the fishes of the sea, and over the birds of the air; • from the Angelis he receives the power to be the me ssenger of the Divine will.

This method of obtaining all kinds of things with p eculiar power, in the twelve signs, is described in many kinds of books. The seal of Hermetis teaches how the powers of the heavenly influence may be obtained under eac h sign in a crystal or gem, that they are constellated, and the n at each period of the twelve signs the appropriat e character of each is divided into four parts, each of which is r epresented by an angel. Therefore, each of the twel ve stories in the badge office of Aaron (Solomonis) was constellated, and the Amorites possessed a constellated stone fo r each idol, and to this end they consecrated the book. Further, King Solomon teaches a hidden Almadel or a Geometrical figure bearing upon the twelve signs o f heaven, which he calls heights, and gives to each height se ven or eight names of princes. There are also many other methods for seeking after the powers of heaven in the twelv e signs, which, for good reasons, must not be made known, because they are not mentioned in the Holy Scriptur es and were kept secret.
