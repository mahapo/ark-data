[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Sefer Yetzirah The Book of Creation Exactly what is the Sefer Yetzirah? Although the name \"Sefer Yetzirah\" means \"The Book of Formation\", or \"The Book of Creation\", is not in any sense a narrative of Creation, or a substitute Gene sis, but is an ancient and instructive philosophica l treatise upon one aspect of the origin of the universe and mankin d; an aspect at once archaic and essentially Hebrew . The grouping of the processes of origin into an arrange ment, at once alphabetic and numeral, is one only t o be found in Semitic authors. See Bob Zucker's Kabbalistic Time Line for the hist ory of The Sefer Yetzirah ยง The \"Gra-Ari\" version started life around 1550 A. D. Rabbi Moshe Cordevero sifted throught the ten be st manuscripts available, choosing the one most closel y fitting the tradition of the Kabbalists. A genera tion later, the text was further refined by \"The Ari\", Rabbi Yitzch ak Luria, one of the greatest Kabbalists of all tim e. A final edited text was finally produced by \"The Gra\", Rabbi Eliah u - Gaon of Vilna, in the 18th century. This is the version used by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in his Commentary \"Sefer Yetz irah: The Book of Creation in theory and practice\" (Revised edition, ISBN 0-87728-855-0, Weiser, 1997), conside red by many to be arguably the most erudite comment ary available in the english language. It includes the complete Hebrew, and English texts of all four majo r versions of this book, a clear and generous commentary and expl anation, and in depth discussions of many areas of Kabbalah lucid explanations and diagrams. An absolutely esse ntial addition to the library of anyone who purport s to study Kabbalism, be it Judaic, Hermetic, Christian or Isl amic. From Rabbi Kaplan's Introduction The Sefer Yetzirah is without question the oldest a nd most mysterious of all Kabbalistic texts. The fi rst commentaries on this book were written in the 10th century, and the text itself is quoted as early as the sixth century. References to the work appear in the first century, while traditions regarding its use attest to its e xistance even in Biblical times. So ancient is this book that its or igins are no longer accessible to historians. We ar e totally dependent on traditions with regard to its authorship. Careful study indicates that it is a meditative tex t with magical overtones. Talmudic traditions indic ate that it could be used to create living creatures, including the G olem! The Sefer Yetzirah is a small and concise boo k, only 1300 words long in the short version and 2500 words long in the long version. The first chapter discusses t he Sefirot; The second chapter is a discussion of the letters of th e Hebrew alphabet, and the 231 gates; Chapters thre e to five discuss the divisions of the letters in relation to astrolo gy. The text was deliberately written in a fashion so t hat it would be meaningless to those who read it wi thout an extensive background in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) a nd Midrash. To guide the novice, Rabbi Kaplan takes great care to introduce the necessary knowledge to the re ader, making it accessible for the very first time to English speakers without a Kabbalistic background.
