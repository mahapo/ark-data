[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"  C A B A L A This ia a simple discourse on some of the major fa cets of the Cabala. It is also spelled as Kabbalah and Qabalah.  O R I G I N S Kabbalah: From the Hebrew word QBL meaning 'an ora l tradition', the esoteric and mystical division of Judaism. The Kabb alah presents a symbolic explanation of the origin of the universe, the relationship of human beings to the Godhead, and an emanationist approach to creation whereby the Infinite Light (AIN SOPH AUR) manifests through different SEPHIROTH on the TREE OF LIFE. Al though the central book of the Kabbalah, the ZOHAR, was not written do wn until around 1280 -- probably by MOSES de LEON -- the Kabbalah h as spiritual links with GNOSTICISM and other early mystical cosmologie s. In the Kabbalah, all manifestations are said to ha ve their origin in the AIN SOPH AUR and the successive emanations o f the Godhead reveal aspects of his divine nature. The system is thus mo notheistic in essence, but allows for the tenfold structure of th e sephiroth upon the tree of life. The emanations as they proce ed down from the Godhead to the manifested world, are: KETHER (The Crown);CHOKMAH(Wisdom); BINAH(Understan ding);CHESED(Mercy) GEBURAH(Power);TIPHARETH(Beauty & Harmony);NETZACH( Victory); HOD(Splendor);YESOD(Foundation);MALKUTH(The Kingdom ) Occultists in the HERMETIC ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAW N use the Kabbalistic Tree of Life as a matrix or Grid for comparing the Archetypal images of different mythologies that could be adapted to Cere monial Magic. For example, the merciful father (Chesed) has paral lels in other pantheons, namely ODIN (Scandinavia); ZEUS(Greece); JUPITER(Rome); and RA(Egypt). This system of comparison became kno wn as MYTHOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCES. It has become common in the occult tradition to link the ten sephiroth of the Tree of Life with the 22 cards of the MAJOR ARCANA of the TAROT.  D E F I N I T I O N S QBL: Hebrew word meaning 'from mouth to ear', ther eby signifying a secret oral tradition. It is the meaning of Ka bbalah. Ain Soph Aur: Hebrew expression meaning 'the limit less light'. Sephiroth: The ten speres or emanations on the Kab balistic Tree of Life, a symbol which depicts the divine energ y of creation proceeding like a lighting flash throug h ten different stages, culminating in physical manifestation. The sephiroth represent levels of spiritual reality both in the cosmos and in people because the Tree, metaphorically, is th e 'Body of God', and people are created in his image. The Tr ee is sometimes shown superimposed on the body of ADAM KADMON --the archetypal man. Tree of Life: The Tree consists of Ten spheres, or sephiroth, through"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" which according to mystical tradition- -the creation of the world came about. The sephiroth are al igned in three columns headed by the SUPERNALS (KETHE R, CHOKMAH, BINAH) and together symbolize the process by which the infinite light (Ain Soph Aur) becomes manifest in the universe. Beneath the Supernals are the 'Seven d ays of Creation': CHESED,GEBURAH,TIPHARETH,NETZACH,HOD,Y ESOD,MALKUTH. Taken as a whole, the tree of life is also a symbol of the archetypal man -- ADAM KADMON, and the sephiroth have a role resembling that of the CHAKRAS in YOGA. The mystical path of self knowledge entails the red iscovery of all the levels of ones being, ranging from Mal kuth (physical reality) to the infinite source. With this in m ind, the medieval Kabbalists divided the Tree of Life in to three sections of the soul: NEPHESCH (the animal soul) corre sponding to the sephiroth YESOD: RUACH (the middle sou l), corresponding to the sephiroth from HOD to CHESED: and NESC HAMAH ( the spiritual soul) corresponding to the Supernals - -especially BINAH. Practitioners of WESTERN MAGIC, who us e the Tree of Life as a glyph for the unconscious mind, s ometimes distinguish the MAGICAL PATH (which embraces all t en sephiroth) from the MYSTICAL PATH of the MIDDLE PILLAR , which is an ascent from MALKUTH through YESOD and TIPHARE TH to KETHER on the central pillar of the Tree. Zohar: 'The Book of Splendor'--the principal book of the Kabbalah. It is thought to have been written by Moses de L eon and was first circulated around 1280-1290, in Guadalajar a. It included commentaries on the TORAH. Gnosticism: Gnosis is a Greek term for 'knowledge' . The term applies to (Gnosis) certain religous sects that emerged du ring the early formative years of early Christianity, and which belived in 'Hidden Spiritual Knowledge'. The main factor that differentiated them from Chritianity w as their emphasis on knowledge rather than faith. The Christian churche fathers consider ed the Gnostics Heretical, or Heretics. Kether: The first Emanation on the Tree of Life. O ccultists indentify Kether as the state of consciousness where creaton merges with the veils of nonexistance. Kether lies on t he MIDDLE PILLAR and trancends the duality of CHOKMAH (male) and BINAH (female), which lie immediately below on the Tree. It is th erefore symbolized in mystical tradition by the heavenly ANDRO GYNE (male and female united in one), and represents a state of m ystical Transcendence and union with the Supreme. It is compared to SATORI and NIRVANA. Chokmah: The second emanation on the Tree of Life, following Kether. Occultists identify Chokmah with the Great Father, the giver of the seminal spark of life which is potent o nly until it enters the womb of the Great Mother, Binah. From t he union of the Great Father and Great Mother come forth al l the images of creation. Chokmah is associated with such d eities as KRONOS, SATURN, THOTH, ATUM-RA,and PTAH, in other p antheons. Binah: The third emanation on the Tree of Life. Oc cultists identify"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Binah with the Great Mother in all her forms . She is the womb of forthcoming, the source of all the great images and forms that manifest in the universe as archetypes. She is also the Supreme female principal in the process of C reation and, via the process mythological correspondences, is associated with such deities as The VIRGIN MARY, RHEA, ISIS, and DEMETER. Chesed: The fourth emanation on the Tree of Life. Occultists identify Chesed as the ruler (but not Creat or) of the manifested universe; and he is characterised as stable , wise, and merciful by contrast with his more dynamic opposite, GEBURAH. Chesed is asscociated with Gods ZEUS (Greek ), and JUPITER(Roman). Geburah: The fifth emanation on the Tree of Life. Geburah is often associated with MARS, the Roman God of War, and represents severity and Justice. The destructive force s of the sphere of Geburah are intended to have a purging, cle ansing effect on the universe. Geburah represents the Creator Go d, who applies discipline and presicion in governing the c osmos and removes unwanted or unnecessary elements after thei r usefullness has passed. Geburah is reflected in THE CHARIOT EER in the TAROT. Tiphareth: The sixth emanation on the Tree of Life .It is the sphere of beauty, harmonizing the forces of mercy(C hesed) and Judgement (Geburah), higher on the Tree. Occultists identify Tiphareth as the sphere of spiritual REBIRTH, and a scribe to it the Solar Deities such as RA,APOLLO, and MITH RA as well as OSIRIS and JESUS CHRIST. The TAROT card TEMPERAN CE identifies the direct mystical ascent to Tipareth from M alkuth(the physical). Netzach: The seventh emanation on the Tree of Life . Netzach is regarded as the sphere of creativity, subjectivity, and the emotions -- a very clear contrast to the sphere of HOD, which represents intellect and rational thought. Netzach is the sphere of Love, and spiritual passion and is therefore associated with su ch deities as APHRODITE, VENUS, HATHOR, and others that p ersonify these qualities. Hod: The eighth emanation on the Tree of Life. Hod is associated with the planet Mercury and represents intellect and rat ional thought. It also represents the structuring and measuring capaci ties of the mind as opposed to the emotion and intuitional aspects of Netzach. Hod has no exact parallel in the TAROT, but is closely linked to the card JUDGEMENT, ascribed to the path between Hod and Malkuth. Yesod: The ninth emanation on the Tree of Life. Ye sod is associated with the Moon and the element Water. Regarded as a Female sphere, it is the seat of sexual instinct and corresponds t o the Genitals Chakra on the archetypal man, ADAM KADMON. On the Tr ee of Life Yesod has the function of channelling the energies of t he higher down to the earth below(Malkuth). Occultists associate Ye sod with the ASTRAL PLANE, because if the sephiroth above Malkuth are regarded as a map of the unconscious psyche, Yesod is the most accesible area of the mind. Because Yesod is the sphere of Fertility and Lunar imagery, it is identified with Witchcra ft and Goddess Worship."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" It also the so called 'animal soul' know by k abbalists as Nephesch. Malkuth: The tenth emanation of the Tree of Life. Malkuth is associated with the Goddesses of the Earth especially PERSEPHONE(Greece), PROSERPINA(Rome), and GEB(Egypt). Malkuth i s the domain of the manifested universe, the immediate envirome nt, the plane of physical reality. As a consequence, all 'in ner journeys of consciousness' begin symbolically in Malkut h; it is particularly appropriate, for example, that the myth of the rape of PERSEPHONE confirms her both as queen of the UNDERWORL D and as a Lunar Goddess. From an occult point of view, the Underworld equates with the Lower unconscious mind, and the Mo on, represented by the sphere of Yesod, is the first Sephirah reac hed on the inner mystic journey up the Tree of Life. Malkuth is closely linked with the TAROT card THE WORLD. A SAMPLING OF HIDDEN CODES IN THE TORAH ======================================= Here is a sampling of some of the hidden words in the Torah. Since the Hebrew cannot be uploaded, the transliteration is a s follows: Aleph = A Bet = B Gimel = G Dalet = D Hey = H Vav = V Zayin = Z Chet = Kh Tet = T Yod = Y Kaf = Ch Kaf Sofit = Ch: Lamed = L Mem = M Mem Sofit = M: Nun = N Nun Sofit = N: Samech = $ Ayin = E Pei = P Phei = Ph Phei Sofit = Ph: Tzadi = Tz Kuf = Q Reish = R Shin = Sh Sin = S Tav =Th The chart below works as follows: The first column is the hidden word. Second colu mn is the location of the starting letter. The third column is the word in th e sentence which \"houses\" the starting letter of the hidden word. The letter enclosed <X> is the first letter of the hidden word. If the housing word appe ars more than once in the same sentence, the number of the correct word appea rs here in parentheses. The fourth column indicates spacing, i.e., 49 indic ates there are 49 letters BETWEEN the letters of the hidden word. An \"R\" in t he fifth column indicates the hidden word is spelled out in reverse. The last column is just a transliteration of the first column for ease of com prehension. .\"AMTh\" Genesis 1:1-5 BRAShY<Th> 50 R Emet (Truth) .\"ThVRH\" Genesis 1:1-5 BRAShY<Th> 49 Torah .\"ThVRH\" Genesis 49:28-30 VZA<Th> 49 Torah .\"ThVRH\" Exodus 1:1-7 ShMV<Th> 49 Torah .\"ThVRH\" Exodus 39:8-13 ThChL<Th> 49 Torah .\"ThVRH\" Numbers 1:1-3 MSh<H> 49 R Torah .\"ThVRH\" Numbers 34:9-12 Z<H> 49 R Torah .\"ThVRH\" Deut. 1:5-8 <H>ThVRH 48 R Torah .\"ThVRH\" Deut. 32:3-7 LAL<H>YNV 48 R Torah .\"ALHYM\" Genesis 1:7-9 <A>Th 26 Elokim .\"Y-VH\" Genesis 1:8-9 AL<H>YM 26 R The Name .\"QYN\" Genesis 4:13-15 <Q>YN 49 Cain .\"HBL\" Genesis 4:23-25 OD<H> 49 Abel .\"MLACh\" Genesis 2:1-2 V<Ch>L 26 R Malach"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" .\"ShBTh\" Exodus 34:35- M<Sh>H (2) 49 Shabat .\"ShBTh\" Exodus 35:3-5 A<Sh> 49 Shabat .\"ABRHM\" Genesis 1:22-26 <A>LHYM 49 1 Avraham .\"Y-VH\" Levit 1:1 V<Y>QRA 7 The Name .\"Y-VH\" Levit. 1:2-3 <Y>QRYB 21 The Name .\"Y-VH\" Levit. 1:3- <Y>QRYBNV 13 The Name .\"Y-VH\" Levit. 1:3 YQR<Y>BNV 34 The Name .\"MThThYHV\" Deut. 34:5-10 <M>ShH 49 Matityahu .\"YSRAL\" Genesis 1:30-2:3 E<L> 49 R Yisrael .\"YSRAL\" Genesis 1:31-2:1 HShSh<Y> 7 Yisrael .\"LAH\" Genesis 28:2-6 <L>Ch: 49 2 Leah .\"RKhL\" Genesis 28:5-6 A<R>M: 49 2 Rachel .\"YHVDH\" Genesis 49:8-11 YHVD<H> 49 R,2 Yehuda .\"MShH\" Genesis 50:24:25 V<H>ELH 49 R,2 Moshe .\"MShH\" Exodus 13:18-19 ALHY<M> 49 2 Moshe .\"ThVRH\" Genesis 28:13-16 A<Th>NNH 26 Torah .\"MQDSh\" Genesis 28:15:16 VH<Sh>BThYCh:26 R Mikdash(Temple) .\"HMVEDYM\" Genesis 1:8-16 ShMY<M> 70 R HaMoadim .\"Y-VH(Y)\" Genesis 1:25-27 V<Y>ES 26 The Name .\"(Y)-VHY\" Genesis 1:25-27 H<Y>M: 26 R The Name .\"ERBH\" Genesis 1:11-15 V<E>Tz: 49 Arava .\"LVLB\" Exodus 2:7-11 HE<L>MH 49 Lulav .\"HD$\" Numbers 4:28-32 ShN<H> 49 Hadas .\"AThRG\" Deut. 1:32-37 L<A>MR 49 Etrog .\"BRChH Deut. 1:1-32 HD<B>RYM 613 Bracha .\"RMBM\" Exodus 11:9-12:13 <R>BVTh Init 3 Rambam .\"MShNH\" Exodus 11:9-12:13 <M>ShH 49 3 Mishneh .\"ThVRH\" Exodus 11:9-12:13 A<Th>V 49 3 Torah .\"NTzY\" Deut. 28:63-64 V<N>$KhThM: 49 Nazi .\"HShVAH\" Deut. 31:16-18 MSh<H> 49 HaShoah .\"HYTLR\" Genesis 8:21 <H>ADMH 31 R Hitler .\"H$\" Genesis 8:1 BThB<H> 31 Hess .\"RVML\" Genesis 8:20 HTHV<R> 31 Rommel .\"BQ\" Genesis 8:22 V<Q>R 31 R Beck .\"DNYTz:\" Genesis 8:21 EV<D> 31 Danitz .\"MVTh\" Genesis 8:3 H<M>YM:(2) 31 R Mavet .\"HShVAH\" Genesis 8:14 <H>ARTz: 62 2x31 HaShoah 1) \"ABRHM\" begins with the Aleph <A> of ALHYM and ends about 250 letters later on the Mem <M> of ALHYM. 2) Note the section of Torah this word is embedded in. 3) Rambam appears as the initial letters of \"Rabos Mofsai B'eretz Mitzrayim.
