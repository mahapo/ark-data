Nor will it be needful to state that the literature called Kabalistic rose up among the Jews during the Christian centuries which succeeded their dispersal and the destruction of their Holy City. It offers a strong contrast to the sacred scriptures of Israel, which are direct, beautiful and simple, while Kabalism is involved, obscure and in many ways repellent as regards its outward form. The Bible is in focus with humanity ; the Kabalah is distorted out of all correspondence with the simple senses, and we must grind our intellectual lenses with exceeding care if we would bring it into perspective. From whatever point of view it may be approached, the Kabalah is, however, of importance : it connects with literatures which are greater than itself and with pregnant issues of history. It is part of the history of philosophy, and as such it once entered into the thought of Europe. It is responsible, broadly speaking, for all that strange tissue of symbolism and ceremonial which made up the magic of the Middle Ages; at a later period it sought to transform alchemy ; it tinctured many of those con ventional practices and beliefs which we term super-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"x. preface stition generically, and the guise in which we know them is therefore chiefly a Kabalistic guise. If we might dare to suppose for a moment that behind magic, behind alchemy, behind astrology there is any mystery of secret and real knowledge, then it is entitled to peculiar respect, because, by the hypothesis of some of its defenders, it is through this seemingly impassable literature that the road to the secret lies. A comprehensive account of the Kabalah, in the main bibliographical and historical, but seeking to establish its connections with other forms of occult phil osophy and to determine its influence and importance from more than one standpoint, is the design of the present work, in which special regard has been also paid to the limitations and requirements of English readers in other words, of those unacquainted with the lan guages, dead and living, in which Kabalistic literature has been, with few exceptions, available heretofore. The subject is exceedingly abstruse, and has been presented by some of its expositors after a highly technical fashion ; in this case there is no knowledge assumed in the reader, and hence all technicalities have been avoided, while the scope of the enterprise much exceeds the one or two attempts mostly in foreign tongues which have been made to simplify the study of the Kabalah. It is the result of an inquiry under taken, in the first instance, for my own personal requirements ; and I must add, in fairness to my readers and in gratitude to early labourers in this obscure field of research, that the abounding diffi culties of the Hebrew and Aramaic originals have been simplified by recourse to the vast storehouses of Rabbinical lore entombed for some centuries in such Latin collections as those of Buxtorf, Bartolocci,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"JkeCace xi. Pistorius and Rosenroth ; a very large proportion of the materials necessary for an intelligent familiarity with Jewish esoteric tradition are, indeed, to be found in these. These and other resources have been strengthened subsequently by a considerable range of reading among modern writers in England, France and Germany who, directly and indirectly, have concerned themselves with the subject. The work has there fore the learner s advantage of being without pretence and without ambition, but it is believed at the same time to contain all that the ordinary student is likely to require in order to appreciate at their proper worth the various claims preferred on behalf of the Kabalah by those who take it seriously at this day. It is necessary to add that it has been written by a tran- scendentalist and chiefly for the use of transcendent- alists ; in offering materials for their judgment, it also indicates the lines of the conclusions to which the writer leans himself, and seeks to enforce some of them. It has been preceded in England by only two books dealing directly with the subject ; one is the slight but not inconsiderable essay of Dr. Ginsburg,* which is critical rather than descriptive, and is, on the whole, hostile in its tendency. It has been, moreover, long out of print. The other is the &quot; Kabbalah Unveiled&quot;! of Mr. S. L.

The present comprehensive account fulfils a distinct purpose, and may, it is hoped, be held to occupy, not altogether unworthily, a vacant place from which there is a wide prospect, by no means deficient in importance for those who are not transcendentalists, for the student of philosophy and history, and for the curious in paths of literature which the elder D Israeli, despite the bias of his birthright, forebore to enter. The works containing the esoteric tradition of Israel, as distinguished from the exoteric tradition embodied in the Talmud and its dependencies, fall, under two heads : a. The Sepher Yetzirah, or &quot; Book of Formation.&quot; b. The Zohar, or &quot; Splendour.&quot; Connected with the &quot; Book of Formation &quot; are its commentaries, foremost among which are those of Saadya Gaon, Rabbi Azariel Ben Menahem and Rabbi Abraham Ben Dior. The treatise itself is comprised within a few pages. The Zohar proper is a commentary on the five books of Moses,* but a number of distinct treatises are connected with or embedded therein. There are also supplements and additions which must be considered to some extent separate from the original collection. With the Zohar, furthermore, are connected certain important developments and commentaries, some of which are included in the Kabbala Denudata of Rosenroth. They fall under two heads : i.

Those which expound and extend the doctrines of Pneumatology which are established in the Zohar. These commentaries are, of course, the work of later Kabalists whose dates can be fixed with more or less certainty. Such Zoharistic writings have been sometimes confused with the Zohar.f Some classifications of the Kabalah also include and give prominence to : c. The Sepher Sephiroth i.e., the &quot; Book of Numerations,&quot; or &quot; Emanations.&quot; d. A treatise entitled ^sk Metzarcph, or &quot; Puri fying Fire.&quot; Whatever their authority and importance, there is no warrant for placing these works among the great classics of the Kabalah. The &quot; Book of Emanations &quot; is more properly set down among the dependencies of the Sepher Yetzirah, while that of &quot; Purifying Fire&quot; occupies a peculiar position, as it is almost without a history, and as it is perhaps the only Kabalistic treatise which deals directly with alchemy. Its date is doubtful and its authorship entirely unknown. A short but comprehensive account of all the works which have been mentioned above will be found in Books IV., V., and VI. ; an attempt at such a formal tabulation has not been made previously in the English language. The first three books contain a historical and critical survey of the entire subject, t Thus in the &quot; Kabbalah Unvcik-d,&quot; Mr. Mathers mentions the &quot;House of God,&quot; or of &quot;The Elohim,&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Revolutions of Souls,&quot; among the most important sections of the Zohar.

The seventh book is devoted to the Christian students of the Kabalah, and collects for the first time the opinions of the chief Christian scholars whose names have been connected with Kabalism. The design of this book is to exhibit a consensus of opinion among all those authorities who are most in vogue with occultists as to what is of value in the Jewish esoteric traditions and as to what is waste substance. On this point there has never been any real difference of sentiment, except in the modern school of transcendentalism, which, devoid of a proper criterion of judgment, and regarding the entire subject from a new standpoint, has been disposed to accept everything indiscriminately as part of the genuine tradition, and has thus esteemed the apparatus of Gematria and Notaricon as no less important and mysterious than the Zoharistic philosophy of the unconditioned summed up in Ain Soph. The eighth book deals briefly with other channels through which the esoteric tradition is believed to have been perpetuated in the West and their con nection with the channel of Kabalism. To those who may approach the work from the historical and bibliographical standpoint the presence of its leading motive and its appeal to a single class of students may require some explanation. It has, I believe, been suggested that since the appearance of Dr. Ginsburg s destructive criticism there has been no"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ih-cfacc xv. interest among English scholars in the subject of the Kabalah. Among mere scholars that is to say, within the region of research which has only a scholastic horizon there was no interest which calls for special mention at the period which preceded that work immediately, and it is quite true that there has been as little subsequently to its publication, but not mainly on account of Dr. Ginsburg s criticism. There has been always, or, speaking exactly, since the days of Thomas Vaughan, Cudworth and the Cambridge Platonists, a certain class of thinkers for whom the claims made by and on behalf of the Kabalah have possessed great interest and importance, and this class is now much larger than at any date prior to 1865. It also forms intellectually a more respectable and considerable body than the academical reader might be disposed to imagine in the absence of much acquaintance with the literature by which it is represented. One is obliged to speak of these thinkers under the generic designation of occult students, though the phrase is somewhat inexact and has been used to describe persons who have little title to earnest consideration. A proscribed mode of thought is here, as in other cases, identified ungenerously with the meaner capacities that follow it, and an unpopular subject is classed according to the waste and drift which has collected about it. But the class to which I have adverted does not in itself deserve either ridicule or contempt ; it is that which believes in the perpetuation of a secret religious, or, more correctly, theosophical, tradition from an early period of human history, and this is not manifestly an unwarrantable consequence to draw from the study of religions undertaken philosophically. Now,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xv. the Kabalah is not only, as I have said, the occult philosophy of Jewry, it is not only one of the chief sources from which occult science and philosophy have drawn in the western world, but it has been further represented to be the channel of such a tradition as I have just mentioned. It is therefore not merely reasonable to suppose, but it is true as a fact, that to occultists, and to them almost exclusively, an inquiry like the present must appeal. Other interests are accidental ; their interest is vital. To determine the claims of the Kabalah as a department and inspiring centre of occult philosophy is to deter mine that which is of most real moment regarding it. It is for this reason that I have been led to consider the Kabalah, not, indeed, as an occultist in the accepted sense, but from the occult standpoint, and to recur with so much frequency to the belief in a secret doctrine of religion, as well as to some other connected questions which need reconsideration at the hands of those who hold them. If I have had in the course of the inquiry to reduce certain illusions to their proper place in the realm of the fantastic, more especially if I have contracted the sphere of what is called Mysticism within its proper dimensions, I trust that I shall be justified, so far as regards my intention, by those whom I have sought to disabuse. From its nature the foundation of Mysticism cannot be in occult science or in occult philosophy, while it is on the historical side alone that it connects with any traditions of the past, popular or achromatic.* * The reason is indicated by Schopenhauer, when he remarks on the astonishing unanimity of mystics in all ages, unlike in everything except those principles which constitute mysticism, and yet not holding those principles as a sect clings to its tenets, for they are not and can never be a sect."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xv - In the course of the general inquiry I have endeavoured to elucidate the most curious Kabalistic teachings on the subject of the soul, its origin and destiny, the primal state of man, the life of the world to come and the Messianic dream of Jewry. I should add that this study is mainly concerned with the documents, and as such it cannot deal exhaustively with all the issues. It is also biblio graphical rather than philosophical. The exhaustive study of the Kabalah would have to be made in connection with that of comparative religion, demand ing qualifications to which I can make no claim and a space for its development which would have been, under any circumstances, impossible. I could wish my inquiry to be regarded rather as the note-book of a student methodised. Finally, the work has been performed in a spirit of impartiality, and this is per haps the only side on which it leans towards perfection. There has been no interest at stake which I have felt myself compelled to defend, and it is therefore free from the animus of extreme hostile criticism, as well as from the unreasoned assumptions of those in the main non-critical believers who still have the cause of the Kabalah at heart. I claim, furthermore, that I have considered honestly and sympathetically all the interests at stake, including those which the bias of modern scholarship is inclined to overlook, or to dismiss in an intolerant spirit. I should add that the history of this book has been chequered and somewhat unfortunate. The manuscript was completed for press at the end of 1898, and in the year following the greater part had been set up and a number of the sheets machined, which were wholly destroyed in a fire at the printer s."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xv. The delay which thus occurred was considerable in itself, and was increased still further through the suspension of the publishing house by which it was to be issued. In the interval which has elapsed during the course of those fresh negotiations which have resulted in its production under the auspices of the Theosophical Publishing Society, and during the resetting of the entire work, Dr. S. Karppe has published in Paris his elaborate Etude sur les Origines et la Nature du Zoliar, which approaches the subject from a standpoint entirely different to my own, but is at the same time a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Jewish theosophy, and I note with satisfaction that there are many debated points on which, working thus independently, we have reached the same conclusion. Dr. Karppe s study is designed for the scholar and the philosopher, while my own, as already explained, is intended, primarily at least, for the occult student. The Jewish mysticism which led up to and preceded the Zohar is very fully presented by him, but of the influence exercised by that work and of its after history he has nothing to tell us. On the other hand, the scheme of my own treatise has led me of necessity to pass lightly over pre-Zoharic theosophy, over Saadyah, Ibn Gebirol, Judah Ha Levi, Aben Ezra, Maimonides, &c., because they did not affect materially the occult thought of Europe, and to give prominence to Kabalistic literature in its later phases, to the Christian students of the subject, and to its influence upon other channels of esoteric tradition in Europe. Among the points of agreement between Dr. Karppe and myself may be mentioned the common recognition of the heterogeneous nature of the Zohar, which has"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xx. justified me in terming it a medley ; of the specifically Jewish character of Zoharic mysticism, which has justified me in denying that it is referable exclusively to any one school of thought outside Jewry ; of the rapid deterioration of the Kabalah, subsequent to the appearance of the Zohar, into a thaumaturgic system ; of the undue prominence which has been given to the commentaries on the Zohar and the false impressions which have been the result ; of the preconception which governed the mind of most Christian students of the literature, by which they were led to regard it as an unacknowledged depository of Christian doctrine ; of the absence in the Sepher Yetzirah of any distinctive pantheism or emanationism. There is also considerable similarity, both of thought and treatment, in the development of the Kabalistic and typically Zoharic doctrines concerning God and the universe, more especially concerning Ain Soph and creation ex nihilo. It would be easy to multiply these instances, nor less easy to furnish numerous points of divergence, for, on the other hand, Dr. Karppe has, I think, laid too much stress on his distinction between the early Jewish mysticism and that of the Zoharic period, not because such a distinction is either non-existent or unimportant in itself, but because I cannot find that it has been challenged by any qualified writer. And I must, of course, as a mystic, take exception to the conception of mysticism expressed or implied throughout the whole work. Mysticism is not a double doctrine, whether of monotheism for the initiate and of many deities for the vulgar, or of any other such antithesis as the priestcrafts may have derived in the past, but it is outside possibility to do more in the present place than"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"xx. refer to this point and register the bare fact that the students to whom personally I appeal will join issue with Dr. Karpe as to all that follows from his con ception, whether it be a matter of simple definition, such as that mysticism is a reprisal of faith against science, or of historical criticism, as for example, when he observes that the doctrine of ecstacy is almost unknown to Jewish theosophy, a statement, however, which the author himself abundantly, though not explicitly, modifies at a later stage of his study. To this exception may be added certain points of critical importance, to which, personally, I have only had occasion to refer in passing. The student will also notice a tendency in certain instances to pass over questions of criticism as if there had never been a dispute regarding them : on the one hand the commentary of Hay Gaon is made use of as if no scholar had challenged its authenticity ; and, on the other, the late date of the Bahir is taken for granted. Criticism may not have said its last word on either subject, but Dr. Karppe ignores the criticism. The limits of the present work which, as regards the original intention, have been already exceeded, have necessitated the omission of a number of subsidiary yet not unimportant matters. I will mention two only : certain developments of pneuma- tology and eschatology which are representative of the doctrinal or systematic part let us say, the hells of Kabalism : certain historical consequences, such as the mission of Sabbatai Zevi, the Neo-Pietists and the Zoharists. But in each case these omissions are without real consequence for the occult student."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"BOOK I POST-CHRISTIAN LITERATURE OF THE JEWS ARGUMENT The literature of Kabalism has a philosophical, historical and, within certain limits, an exegetical interest for ordinary students, but it has a living interest only for those who believe ; (a) That a secret religious tradition has been perpetuated from the early ages of history, and (b) That Kabalistic literature has been one of its vehicles. Such persons are here termed occult students. The purpose of the present book is to show that whatever be the value of the first view (a), imperfect investigation has placed the second (h) in a false position.

This storehouse of Hebrew theosophy, for such it is, has exercised a peculiar fascination on many great minds of Christendom, and its Gentile students, even at the present day, may, for all that we can tell, be as numerous as its Jewish disciples. It is called the Kabalah, of which term there is more than one expla nation suggested by the makers of romance in etymology. For example, the word has been derived from the name of the Hindoo teacher Kapila,* to whom a philosophy of numbers is ascribed, seemingly on the slender ground that one branch of Kabalistic literature also deals largely with this subject. Another equally fanciful suggestion makes the term an analogue of Cybele,t the mythological Queen of Heaven, who is thus connected with the Jewish personification of Wisdom under a female aspect. As to the true derivation there is no room for uncertainty, and it possesses that simplicity which is so often the seal of truth in things of language as it has been said to be in Mr. C. W.

THE DOCTRINE OF THE FOUR WORLDS The Sephirotic system was concerned first of all, as I have indicated, with the mystery of Divine Evolu tion. From that unsearchable condition which is above consciousness, by a mysterious operation, the Uncreated Will moved outward, and subsequently three manifestations or relations of Deity were estab lished. By the first manifestation the Ain Soph passed from latency into activity ; the non-Ego became Ego, subsisting still, however, in a condition which is humanly inconceivable, in the state of pure abstract thought.

But AL and its derivatives, Jehovah, or the Lord of Hosts, those lesser names of which the contents can be grasped by the human mind and can therefore be uttered, are the Names of the Lesser Countenance. The relation between Macroprosopus and Microprosopus is the philosophical hypothesis of the correspondence between the absolute as it is and the absolute as conceived by man. The disparity between them registers the inadequacy of all human conceptions of the Uivinity, fully recognised by every Kabalist as abounding in that book which he re garded as more Divine than any. Like the Sephirotic system, the doctrine of the Four Worlds and the two Countenances is curiously involved, and though in its elements it is exceedingly simple, in its elaborations it is highly technical. As in the single Sephirotic scheme with which we have been dealing here the first triad of emanations is held to represent the world of Atziluth, so the second triad comprehends Briah and the third the world of Formation, or Yetzirah. Assiah^ the fourth world, is contained in Malkuth. Now, with Microprosopus there is associated the symbol of a Bride, who is in fact Malkuth, or the Kingdom, in which sense it would follow that the visible creation is the Spouse of God, or rather of that lesser Divine Manifestation which alone communicates with man.

V. THE INSTRUMENTS OF CREATION It must be confessed that, so far, Kabalistic litera ture deserves to be called philosophical. The doctrine of A in SopJi may be classed with Platonic con ceptions ; the SepHirotic system will not suffer by comparison with any other dream of emanation and may even challenge all ; the motive which underlies the metaphysics of the two Countenances is singularly profound and may be regarded as the chief glory of the Kabalah. We must now, however, approach its fantastic portions. We have seen that the World of Briah is that of Creation, but whatever reservations may be inferred from Kabalistic writers on the axiom ex niJdlo nihil fit,\\ we have seen also that their use and the act itself, was invested, as he said, from the earliest times.

Now the materials used and shaped, or, perhaps, more properly speaking, the instruments, the matrices of the material world, are said by the Kabalists to have been the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. According to the Sepher Yetzirah, God imparted to them form and weight by combining and transforming them in divers manners, Aleph with all the rest and all the rest with Aleph ; Beth with all and all with Beth ; and so of the rest.* Some hundreds of permutations were obtained in this manner, which are the origin not only of all languages but of all creatures.

In a word, for him they ceased to be conventions ; a divine revela tion required a divine language to express it, and the alphabet of that language was a derivation from the noumenal world, vessels of singular election, instru ments of Deity, from which it was an easy transition to suppose that such channels of spiritual grace and life must have fulfilled some exalted office in the shaping of the universe itself. * The Massorah was concerned with the body of the text, the rules as to reading and writing the Thorah, and special considerations on the mystic sense of the sacred characters. It was hence the criticism of the Hebrew text. It was also, as already seen, that which was openly delivered by the rabbins in contradiction to that which was supposed to have been communicated secretly.

THE DOCTRINE OF PNEUMATOLOGY We have now ascertained the heads of Kabalistic instruction as to the essential nature of God, the transition from the divine unmanifest into the mani festation of divinity, the extension of the powers and attributes thus developed through the archetypal, creative, formative and material worlds, the Kabalistic hypothesis of creation and the doctrine of tran scendental and natural science. It remains for us to present in brief outline the doctrine of spiritual essences according to Jewish theosophy. This is, perhaps, the favourite and certainly the most recurring subject of the Zohar, and it is this also which was destined to receive fuller development than any other in the later literature of Kabalism. The history of its growth is also worth noting. Pre-existence and the subdivision of the spiritual nature are found in the Talmud, but the Sepher Yetzirah has nothing to tell us on the subject, and there is very little in the first commentators on that treatise. It may be said, with considerable truth, that the book and its connections"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Jlortrinal Content of the gabalafi 75 were concerned rather with the physical forces which produced the universe, but the commentaries at least are sufficiently discursive to have included it in their scheme if they had anything to say upon the subject. It remains, therefore, that the fascinating hypothesis with which we are here dealing is in the main a late growth. The distinction between a holy intelligence and an animal soul in man is found, however, in the &quot; Book of Concealment,&quot; * which, so far as can be judged from its form, is the most ancient portion of the Zohar. The latter cycle may be regarded, broadly speaking, as the chief source of pneumatology in Kabalism proper. The indications contained therein became a vast and ponderous system in the schools of Isaac de Loria and Moses of Cordova. This system has at all times exercised the greatest influence on occultists, and, chiefly, perhaps, because it has been made available in Latin by Rosenroth, has superseded that of the Zohar itself. Franck states that it is not true Kabalism and hints that it is full of distorted rabbinical reveries, but it may be doubted whether there is any real canon of criticism. The later speculations are in any case founded on the Zohar, and the following slight sketch contains the general elements of the subject. We have seen that the world of Briah is that of Creation so-called, that is, of the emanation of creative forces. These forces are the Elohim, and Uriah is * &quot; When the inferior man descends (namely, into this world) there are found (in him) two spirits, according to the supernal form.

It would not be exact to say that the archangels are Elohim, much less that Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Metatron and so forth, are deities according to the Kabalah.* The system is much too involved to admit of such clear identifica tions. In a general way it may perhaps be affirmed that the intelligent forces of the Briatic world, when assumed, so to speak, by the divine world, may be regarded as the Elohim. Thus, according to Kabalism, the three men who appeared to Abraham in the vale of Mamre to announce the destruction impending over the cities of the plain were three archangels, but they were also Adni, the Lord, for they were the forms assumed by the Divinity. Of the hierarchy of spiritual beings outside humanity we meet with various classifications by different Kabalistic writers, the sources of which must be referred to Talmudic times ; but, as regards the descending scale more especially, later authorities do not even hesitate to contradict Zoharic statements.

To determine these points we shall do well to glance first of all at the history of the criticism which has befallen this vast document. We shall get very little help from the insight of contemporary Israel as to either point. The Sepher Yetzirah was known and accepted before docu mentary criticism can be well said to have been born, and so also when the Zohar was promulgated it was among a mixed audience who either took or rejected it on a priori grounds.

The fourteenth century made the grave, but yet excusable, mistake of supposing that most people wrote the books attributed to them. They accepted the claim of the Zohar for much the same reason that they were persuaded of the antiquity of Homer.

In the department of belles lettres it is sufficient to mention the so-called Rowley poems. These, as everybody is well aware, were forgeries pure and simple, and their disguise is so entirely spurious that it can be peeled off without any difficulty. It is not necessary to add that they possessed their believers, and not further back than the days of the Bell edition of Chatterton, the race of Rowleyites had still a few survivals, for we find the editor describing their characteristics in terms which have a wider appli cation than he was concerned with at the moment.

Finally, there are certain works which may or may not be fabrications, but they either incorporate so much genuine material belonging to the depart ment of literature which they pretend to represent, or else are so skilfully constructed that the balance of probability is poised pretty equally concerning them, and it is almost impossible to arrive, by impartial methods, at the determination of their claims. I do not know whether there is any good instance in belles lettres of this kind of alleged fabrication. Hogg s &quot; Jacobite Relics of Scotland &quot; is perhaps the nearest approach to a parallel. That collection undoubtedly contains a large proportion of genuine material, but it is suspected that the Ettrick Shepherd supplied a proportion of the collection by his own skill in verse- craft, and criticism, though it has not concerned itself very seriously, is perhaps fairly divided on the question.

But the most renowned of all the instances is that with which we are here concerned the Kabalah itself. Destructive criticism has maintained that its foremost work was forged by a single writer, of indif ferent claims to our intellectual consideration, at the end of the thirteenth century.

We admit, therefore, that Kabalistic literature belongs to a suspected class, but how we are to regard its impeachment is a different question. The fact that this inquiry has been undertaken will indicate that, in my own opinion, the hostile critic must change the nature of his indictment.

It may be highly probable that in the absence of any such testimony the same point would have been reached independently, but the fact remains that it is not the discovery of modern criticism at all ; it transpired without being sought for, and hence the case against the work is based both on external and internal grounds. It is not therefore at first sight a weak case, and I have sketched it fully and frankly that I may not be accused of any bias in the matter. At the same time it is my purpose to show that the indictment breaks down altogether. Let us dispose first of all of the alleged external evidence.

Simeon ben Jochai, of the period of the Emperor Antoninus, under whose name it appears, but is really the work of his disciples ; and that, finally, it did not become public till after the death of Nachmanides, namely, the second half of the thirteenth century. It is therefore obvious that Zakut must not be classed among those who opposed the Zohar, as some modern critics have attempted. It will seem almost incredible that in this work, which so elaborately defends the Zohar, a narrative should appear which represents it as an imposture devised from mercenary motives by Moses de Leon, yet such at first sight is the case, and as such it has been accepted by those who impeach the Kabalah. The explanation is in reality simple ; the narrative in question is a fragment, and the proof that its missing conclusion is really to the credit of the Zohar, and exculpatory as to the transcriber of that work, is found in the fact that the person whose adventures it relates became subsequently assured that the Zohar was not a sordid forgery, as he embodied some of its principles in one of his own treatises.

In either case, he was at Novara, in Italy, about 1293, when he heard that a Spanish Rabbin was in possession of the original Zohar MSS., and, being very anxious to see them, he made a journey into Spain. He there learned by report that the erudite Moses Nachmanides was said to have transmitted the book to his son in Catalonia from Palestine, f but that the ship which bore it was driven by the wind to AragoniaJ or to Catalonia, and the precious volume came into the hands of Moses de Leon.

The women had been left in poor circumstances, and there was every reason to suppose that they would comply gladly.

The absence of Christian influence, if not absolutely of all reference to Christianity, the absence also of Aristotelian influence, and some points of the argument from the dialect in which the work is written, seem to possess as much force as they did originally in 1843. But the strength of the case in favour of the Zohar is also the strength of the chief objection against it.

The minute considerations are of course highly tech nical, and there are some on both sides which it is wise to abstain from pressing. One of these is the argument that Moses de Leon was an unlikely person to have written such a work as the Zohar, because he was intellectually and morally unfit.* I have noted that he was unlikelv, but possibilities of this kind can only be determined by the event. Many great books have been accomplished by persons who were antecedently improbable, and after all, at the best, we know Moses de Leon only through the testimony of a hostile relative. There is no doubt that the Zohar was to some extent sprung upon the Jewish people at the period of its publication. The manner of its reception was not unmixed ; it was the kind of reception which would be given to a work which was old as regards its materials, but unfamiliar less or more in its form, and this is sufficient to account for any silence of previous authorities, while in the shaping of those materials and the impressing of that form the individual who multiplied the copies may have had a hand.t * Dr. Schiller-Szinessy shows that he was proud of the authorship of his books, and hence unlikely to conceal his hand in the composition of any, but this argument also must not be pressed too far. The same writer terms him an inferior Kabalist, and it seems admitted on all sides that his original books are poor in quality.

THE AGE OF ZOHARIC TRADITION It must not be supposed that the field of criticism is entirely occupied by a hypothesis of unmixed fraud, or that this hypothesis has always fastened upon the same person.* The most favoured delinquent is, of course, Moses de Leon, because he is reported to have circulated the Zohar, but occasionally he appears as the tool of other conspirators. Thus, Samuel Cohen maintains that the Zoharic writings were composed by a convocation of converted Rabbins, convened for the purpose in a Spanish monastery, employing Moses as their publisher, and thus the Church itself seems to figure as an accomplice.f Others, like M. H. Landauer, argue that the true author was Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, while the voice of Dr. Graetz is raised in favour of the school of Abraham ben David of Beaucaire. Abraham ben David of Posquiere and Isaac the Blind are also favoured names, to whom it is indubitable, in any case, that Kabalism owed some thing of development and of impulse.

These remember, for example, that Abraham was in Egypt, and, accepting at once the fairy-tale attribution of the &quot; Book of Formation &quot; to the patriarch, conclude that this document is older than the Ritual of the Dead. It is useless to reason with those whose confidence is not shaken in the face of impossibilities, whose imagi nation can bridge all gulfs in evidence by fantastic suppositions.

We are therefore more concerned in ascertaining the state in which modern criticism has left the content of the Zohar than the form in which it is presented to us. The early students of the work, who accepted and defended its antiquity, did not make this saving distinction, and in many instances modern hostility does not make it either. Upon the surface of the history of Kabalistic criticism the first presumption is, of course, unfavour able to any hypothesis of antiquity, because this would seem to have been admitted in days when scholarship was insufficiently equipped for the determination of such a question. In the light of fuller knowledge it will be thought that the claim has lapsed, or remains only as a pious belief prevailing among an uncritical minority, a few persons being always found whose mental bias predisposes them to the defence of exploded views.

The history of debated questions of this kind teaches another lesson, and the closest approximation to truth is found usually in the mean of extreme views.

If we fail entirely here we may regard the case as closed.

The Jew of Salerno differed from that of France, and the Jew of Spain offered contrasts to both. Without attempting to add another hypothesis to the scores extant as to the origin of Kabalism, I propose to indicate that this literature is naturally, if partially, elucidated by the features of its partial birthplace. Having made a reasonable allowance for spontaneity in Jewish thought, and having noted its observed connections and correspondences in distant times and places, it seems fitting that we should look now to that which lay the nearest. Without dis puting or defending the opinion that Israel may have possessed a tradition handed down by the oral way from early times, of which we have enough evidence to warrant the presumption that it existed but not enough to determine what it actually was, let us begin by considering where the Kabalistic books first began to circulate. That was in Spain. Now, what was the environment of the Jews in the Peninsula at the period in question let us say, from the ninth century and onward ? It differed considerably from that which surrounded them in other countries of Western Europe.

Avicebron is a case in point. There can be no doubt whatever that the erudition of Mohammedanism exercised an influence on the Rabbins, j- who reacted in their turn on the Moslem doctors.} The questions of priority and preponderance may be passed over, because they are here of no importance. We have concluded already that the Zohar presents the mystic thought of preceding centuries in Israel under a certain aspect of transformation. The traditional knowledge, of which we have evidence as to its existence in Talmudic times, had received many developments from many sources and under the influence of many minds. There is ground for supposing that the nucleus in Christian times is first heard of in Palestine, which indeed follows from its connection, once admitted, with R.

Joseph, disciple of Moses the sack-clothed, during the reign of Haschem II., King of Cordova, is the best evidence which can be cited on this point. Islamic mysticism is almost coincident with the mission of the great Islamic prophet. For example, the Ghoolat sect, famous for the &quot; extravagance &quot; of its doctrines, is referred to the time of Ali.

But despite the legend which represents the Zohar as sent from Palestine by Nachmanides, everything points to Spain and the South of France as the chief scenes of the final developments of the Kabalah, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that it has been affected by the prevailing tone of mystic thought in one or both of these places. There is evidence to show that such influence was at work outside the Zohar and prior perhaps to its existence in the form that it now possesses. It was then most probably a part of the very large influence of Avicebron. In post-Zoharic mysticism, and in the commentaries on the Zohar which are the work of Spanish Jews, it may be traced more fully and plainly. In no case does it justify the now exploded criticism which would make the Zohar merely a reproduction or echo of Arabian theosophy, or would regard all Kabalism as referable to Islamic mysticism for its sole source, plus the Greek influence at work in Islam. This was the hypothesis of Tholuck. We are concerned only with a question of complexion and of tincture, and have other criteria by which to judge the true significance of the points of doctrinal resemblance between Sufi and Kabalist concerning the latent state of Deity, the operation of the Divine Will at the beginning of creation, the emanation of the world, &c.

One of the poems in this collection is entitled &quot; Salomon and Absal,&quot; a mystic story of earthly and heavenly love.

The influence of this environment was felt outside the Kabalists, and was confessed even by the most inflexible of the sects in Jewry that of the Kairites, or Literalists, who rejected all innovations in the primeval doctrine of Israel, who set no store by tradition, and were thus as much opposed to the Talmud as to the Zoharic writings. The proof is their analogies, indeed one might say their fusion, with the Motozales, a sect of scholastic Arabs.* A Kairite Jew of the period allows that his brethren followed the doctrines of this sect, and they even assumed its name. The purpose of this section should not be mis construed. Once more, it is by no means designed to indicate that the mystic sects of Mohammedanism are responsible for the peculiar scheme of the Kabalah, or that the Sufi drew from the rabbin.

This is the case with the Sepher Yetzirah itself ; but there is no doubt that all these works pretend to embody an occult tradition, or that it was the elements of oral tradition which subsequently received development from the commentators on the Sepher Yetzirah, as well as from the Zohar, and, later still, from the expositors of Zoharic mysteries. The attention of early Kabalists was concentrated on the &quot;Book of Formation,&quot; and numerous elucidations of that work appeared between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. I.

He wrote philosophy in Arabic and poetry in Hebrew ; the Jews valued his poetry, but his metaphysics were not in repute among them ; the Christian scholastics adopted his philosophical ideas, and knew nothing whatever of his verses.

It is difficult, however, to omit it in giving an account of the documents, and it will perhaps be best to begin this brief bibliographical notice by a summary of the points which have been determined previously concerning it. The legend which attributes it to the patriarch Abraham, who transmitted it orally to his sons, by whom it was perpetuated in turn till the &quot; sages of Jerusalem,&quot; committed it finally to writing, so that the tradition might not perish even when the chosen people seemed themselves on the eve of perishing this, we have seen, is legend. It is interesting and respectable in its way. At the period when we first hear of the existence of such a tract it was possibly already old, and most old books have myths designed to explain them. Those who take the myths historically convert honest legend into something approaching farce. We must be content therefore to say that the Sepher Yetzirah is first mentioned probably in the ninth century ; there is some reason to suppose that it is quoted in the Talmud, but it is not wholly certain;* it * The treatise Sanhedrim contains the following passage: &quot;By means of combining the letters of the ineffable names as recorded in SPR ITsIRH (/ .*, the sealing names enumerated in the first chapter, being permutations of IHV), Rava once created a man and sent him to Rav Zeira.

Let us realise that we do not know, and that those who judge the question dogmatically on either side deserve to be classed as intemperate. Let us now look a little more closely at the work itself. It is divided into five chapters, the first being concerned with the office of the Sephiroth in creation and the remaining four with what have been termed the Instruments namely, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It was after the revelation of these mysteries to Abraham that he received the manifesta tion of God and that the covenant was instituted. According to the expression of the original, God &quot; bound the twenty-two letters &quot; on the tongue of the patriarch and discovered to him all their secrets.* The symbolism of the Book of Formation having been sufficiently considered in the second part of our inquiry, there are only two points which require to be noted here.

Separated from all number and transcending all expression, He is represented as a faithful king sojourning in eternity and ruling the Sephiroth for ever from His holy seat. The second point concerns the emanation of the Sephiroth, to which, in preference to their creation, all later Kabalism inclines. There is little on the face of the Book of Formation to countenance this view ; they appear as the instruments and servants of the King of Ages, informed by whose word they go forth &quot; and returning, fall prostrate in adoration before the Throne.&quot;* It is said, however, that their end is joined to their beginning, as the flame is joined to the firebrand, and perhaps the principle of emanation is contained implicitly in this statement. We have no reason for rejecting a con struction which has been adopted invariably, but it is just to draw attention to the fact that the first work which mentions the Sephiroth leaves this point in obscurity, while it certainly depicts God as the active architect of the universe, who graved, sculptured and builded. The first Sephira is described as the Spirit of the Living God, the blessed and again blessed name of God living eternally. Voice, Spirit and Word these are the Holy Spirit.

As each Sephira was supposed to contain all the Sephiroth, so there was a superin- cession of the four worlds which were all contained in each.

The one question which now remains for con sideration is how we are to account for the importance attributed by occultism to such a work as the Sepher Yetzirah. Do its defenders believe that the com bination of Aleph with all the other letters and all the rest with Aleph, Beth with all the others and all the rest with Beth, &c., &c., actually produced the universe ? That seems an insupportable assumption. Do they regard the letters as symbols of forces and hold that the Sepher Yetzirah teaches that the universe originates in the orderly combination of certain forces ? That is reasonable enough, but it is a commonplace which seems scarcely worth stating and certainly does not require a secret tradition to secure it. But do they consider that the letters represent occult forces, of a fixed, determinable character, and that initiation into the real meaning of Kabalistic tradition will discover their nature, explaining thus the secret behind the arbitrary doctrine of a virtue inherent in words and letters ? This might indeed be valuable, but I have never met with an occultist who took such a view, or had anything to substantiate it if he did.

CONNECTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES OF THE BOOK OF FORMATION Were there evidence to warrant us in believing that Moses de Leon did actually, as his hostile relative is reported to have affirmed, write the Zohar bodily &quot;out of his own head,&quot; there would still be substantial evidence that the Kabalistic system which it contains was not his invention. The existence of the Sepher Yetzirah is part of this evidence, which appears, however, more fully and more strongly in the commentaries and developments of that work. We have seen already that when it came to be printed at Mantua, the Book of Formation was accompanied by five such connections, which at the same time do not exhaust the list that might be given in a full bibliography. The best known is unquestionably the Sepher Sephiroth, or &quot; Com mentary on the Ten Sephiroth by way of Questions and Answers,&quot; the work of R. Azariel ben Menahem ; that of Rabbi Abraham has been regarded as the most important from an occult standpoint, while the earliest in point of time is the work of Saadya Gaon in the tenth century.

Saadya Gaon was published in Hebrew at Mantua together with the Sepher Yetzirah,+ but it was written originally in Arabic, and a copy is preserved in the Bodleian Library. After remaining in MS. for over eight hundred years this Arabic original was at length printed at Paris, together with a French translation, in 1892. In the introduction prefixed to his version, M. Lambert observes that Saadya Gaon appears as a theosophist in his commentary, which is equivalent to saying that the first expository treatise on the Sepher Yetzirah possesses a Kabalistic complexion, though the author is frequently regarded as a purely rationalistic writer. It must be confessed, however, that Saadya offers little connection with Zoharic doctrine. We have noted that the Sephiroth of the Sepher Yetzirah show scarcely any trace of an emanational system. For Saadya Gaon there is one intermediary between God and the world, but this is the physical air and not the transcendental numerations. In this air God is everywhere present, and it penetrates all bodies, even the most compact. Of the doctrine of Ain Soph there is also no real trace. It is, * He describes the Kakilah as a most pure and holy philosophy, but exhibits no acquaintance with the Zohar. + Bartolocci, iv. 267."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"176 ^Elte gJortrine aitb IJiteratttr* ot the Jiabalah however, recognised, on the one hand, that we cannot have an adequate notion of the Divinity or His correspondences with the world, but, on the other, that some approximate idea may be obtained as to the latter and that they may be shown forth by means of figures and comparisons. One of these illustrations tells us that God is the life of the world as the soul is the life of the body, and as in man the soul is all-powerful, so God is omnipotent in the world. He is also its Supreme Reason, and as in man the rational faculty is the guide of life, so the Divine Power is directed by the Divine Reason. Above this elementary and commonplace form of natural theology the commentary never soars, and we may be indeed warranted in saying that the work, as a whole, has no inherent interest, though it is valuable as a historical document. Unlike the Sepher Yetzirah, which makes no reference to pneumatology, Saadya Gaon devotes a certain space to the consideration of the soul in man ; and here, in a sense, he connects with Zoharic Kabalism, though he rejects metempsychosis, for he recognises its five aspects and calls them by their conventional names, which names, however, occur, as we have seen, in the Talmud.* Unfortunately, his classification is exceedingly clumsy, and he begins by following Plato in the recognition of three faculties reason, concupiscence and anger. On account of reason the soul is called Neshamah, on * Despite his hostility to reincarnation as understood by the Kabalah he accepts the pre-existence of souls and teaches that the resurrection of the body will take place when all souls destined for earthly life have passed through it."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"vlhc &amp;lt;I&amp;lt;Llrittcn &amp;lt;l&amp;lt;Uorb of ^abalism 177 account of concupiscence it is called Nephesh, and on account of anger it is called Ruach. The two other names, Chaiah (living) and Jechidali (unique), refer to the vitality of the soul and to the fact that no other creature resembles it. The doctrine concerning divine and angelic names is also the subject of some references which are important to our inquiry because they establish the fact that Saadya Gaon did not ascribe to them any occult virtue. The names of the angels vary according to the events which they are commissioned to accomplish, and, in like manner, those referred to the Deity are descriptive of His operations. In the work of the creation He terms Himself Elohim ; when ordaining the covenant of circumcision He is called El Shaddai ; He is the I AM in connection with the wonders of the ten plagues ; and He is Jah when producing the great miracle of the Red Sea.* As it is with the names of God and the angels, so is it with those of the stars, which vary according to their qualities namely, their greater or lesser brilliance, their hot or cold natures, &c.

With these categories, the ten commandments are also forced to correspond in an arbitrary manner. For example, that against adultery answers to the category of position, for the act itself is a position and a contact. Lastly, in his analysis of the Hebrew alphabet, the commentator seeks to account for its sequence. Aleph is the first sound pronounced z&amp;gt;., it is vocalised at the back of the tongue. Shin is vocalised in the middle of the mouth and Mem on the lips. Un fortunately for the analogy, Mem precedes Shin in the alphabet, and indeed the design of the speculation seems past conjecture. About the commentary ascribed to Hay Gaon there is considerable confusion, which Isaac Myer increases by representing that it deals with the &quot;Book of Concealment,&quot; instead of that of Formation. There are no historic notices and no traces whatsoever of the former tract before the appearance of the Zohar, in which it was first made known. The work of Hay Gaon needs only to be mentioned in passing on account of its disputed authenticity. Other works attributed to him are not above suspicion, but it may be admitted in a general way that he had more distinct Kabalistic connections than Saadya.

Abraham, however, there are Zoharic elements which admit of no question, and it is indeed to the school which he represents that Graetz and others have referred the authorship of the Book of Splendour. There is the peculiar distinction between upper and lower Sephiroth which is not only characteristic of the Zoharic period, but offers a connecting link between R Abraham and the late Kabalism of Isaac de Loria.* But more than this, there is the doctrine of the Unknowable God, of &quot; the Cause of Causes which is not appre hended by any one outside Itself,&quot; being void of all distinction and all mode of existence. It has not assumed the final shape in which it is presented by the Zohar, and it appears to be something more concealed and latent than the conception of Am Soph, the Non Ens or Corona Sut/tma, which again is distinguished by R. Abraham from Kether, the Crown of Creation, on the ground that &quot; the accident is not made from the essence nor the Res from the Non Res or Non Ens&quot; thus occasioning an insoluble difficulty as to the emanation of the manifest universe.

There are also traces of the peculiar angelical system which was destined to receive so much elaborate extension from the com mentators on the Book of Splendour. Before dismissing this commentary we may note the alleged connection of its author with that Abraham the Jew* who belongs to the literature of alchemy. The testament of this mysterious personage transformed Nicholas Flamel from a simple scrivener into a seeker after the Great Work a search, moreover, which legend represents as a success. The memorial in question was addressed to the nation of Israel dispersed by the wrath of God in France, by one who styled himself &quot; priest, prince, Levite, astrologer and philosopher.&quot; The description which constitutes our sole knowledge concerning it is given in another testament, that of Nicholas Flamel, and it is very difficult to decide how far this can be regarded as authentic.

Abraham the Kabalist belongs to the twelfth century. Flamel was two hundred years later, and the book which he mentions could scarcely have existed in Jewry, on the Levi hypothesis, for such a space of time without something transpiring concerning it. As a literary and philosophical work the first place among the dependencies of the Sepher Yetzirah seems correctly assigned to the commentary of Azariel. Its author was born at Valladolid in or about the year 1160. According to some authorities he was a pupil of Isaac the Blind,* but others say that his teacher was R. Jehuda, son of Rabad. He became in turn the instructor of R. Moses Nach- manides, who also belongs to the chain of Yetziratic tradition.f He is said to have travelled much in search of secret wisdom, but it was an age when men of learning were frequently wanderers, and it was perhaps less recondite motives which actuated him- He connects with the Kabalistic system which was expounded by the school of Gerona, and there are no * A.D. 1190 to circa 1210.

The teachings of Azariel aroused the opposition of the Aristotelian Jews, and it is thought by Isaac Myer that the logical form of his commentary was a concession to this school of thought. Whatever its motive, the fact, broadly taken, is of importance to our inquiry ; it shows that the Sephirotic notion in its earliest development could not really have been that of the categories, since it had to be conformed to the principles espoused by the disciples of Aristotle. The Jewish literati followed various schools, and the influence attributed to the Stagirite has perhaps been exaggerated. The votaries of the so-called secret wisdom were a small minority. Platonism, as it is needless to say, was very little known in the West at the period in question, though it appears in the later Kabalism. As regards both matter and form, Azariel s com mentary has been the subject of high praise. It contains the doctrine of Ain Soph, which is not in the Scpher Yetzirah, and it has express views on the emanation of the Sephiroth, which are said to be contained in Ain Soph and of no effect when separated.

With his philosophical speculations the Kabalist mingles something from the fantastic region, attributing, for example, certain symbolic colours to the Sephiroth. * Kether is &quot; like the Concealed Light,&quot; or the light which is veiled in darkness, the comparison intended being probably that of a luminous mist. Binah is sky-blue, because Binah is the great sea of Kabalism. Chokmah is yellow, Chesed white and Geburah red ; Tiphereth is white, red, or pink, Netsach is whitish-red and Hod reddish- white.

The Kabbala Denudata, by attempting to cover much too wide a field, gives no adequate idea of the work which it is meant to elucidate. It attributes an exaggerated, though not inexcusable, importance to three tracts introduced into the body of the Zohar and to late commentary on these ; the apparatus in the form of a lexicon which fills most of the first volume, though it has a -methodical appearance, is little more than a chaos, in which late and early expositors are bundled together after the uncritical manner of the period ; in a later section undue prominence is given to some personal discussions and correspondence between the Editor and Henry More, the English platonist ; finally, the second volume includes an enormous treatise on the doctrine of the Revolutions of Souls by a Kabalist of the seventeenth century.

The philosophical doctrines which I have sketched in the early sections of the previous book do certainly connect superficially with occult philosophy, which itself seems to connect magnetically with everything that is unsound in faith and unreasonable in doctrine. The connection in the present instance can only show that neither is of serious account in the last analysis. That God is immanent in the material world is a much simpler and more rational hypothesis than to establish intermediaries between finite and infinite, which create innumerable difficulties without resolving any.

We have seen that in a certain manner somewhat occasional and informal it is a commentary on the Pentateuch, and it is understood and passed over that it is a forced, arbitrary commentary, which has nothing in harmony with the simple sense of Scripture. It would serve no purpose to enlarge upon this fact, which applies to all Kabalistic exegesis. The governing principle of its inter pretation or treatment is the existence of several senses in the written word. These are differently enumerated, and there seems no reason why they should not be extended indefinitely, but they are reducible broadly under three heads, which are compared by the Zohar to the garment, the body which is within it and the soul which is within the body. &quot; There are those unwise,&quot; it says, &quot; who behold how a man is vested in a comely garment, but see no farther, and take the garment for the body, whereas there is something more precious [than either], namely, the soul.

It led of course into extravagance ; the second sense became in its turn inadequate and one more concealed was inferred. So also, besides a general latent meaning, there was that more particular triple significance attributed to each several word. As the possibilities suggested by such a method are infinite, it is unnecessary to say that these senses were never methodised, or that the Zohar does not unfold in a consecutive form either the allegorical or mystical meaning. It gives glimpses only, and it may be in this sense that the original Zohar is said to have been a camel s load. That original was a latency in the minds of Kabalistic rabbins, but it was never written with pen. As the Zohar establishes the necessity of the concealed meaning on the insufficiency of the outward, arid as the sense of such insufficiency is indubitably a late event in the history of sacred documents, we have full evidence for deciding the value of the claim which it elsewhere makes to a high antiquity for its interpretation.

We know that, according to Genesis, he was made of the dust of the earth, that the breath of life passed over him and that he became a living soul. The Zohar is able to tell us what transpired before this event : &quot; When it entered into the will of the Holy One to create man, He called before Him many- hosts of the superior angels and said unto them, It is my will to create man.

There are, of course, many other passages in the Zohar which are explanatory of the creation of man.

In Psalm xci. 11, it is said: &quot; He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways,&quot; which passage the New Testament applies in a special manner to Christ. The Zohar explains it as follows : &quot; When man comes into the world there appears in him at that moment the evil spirit which always arraigns him. . . . This evil spirit never forsakes man from the day that he is born into the world. But the good spirit comes to the man from the day that he is made clean. When does a man become clean ?

The pneumatology of the Zohar is more fully developed in the connections of that work than in the commentary proper.

In the excerpts which have been now given the Zohar appears at its best, but I may observe in conclusion that, again after the manner of a medley, it combines with things precious others that are of little value and not a few that are indescribably foolish.

But, in conclusion, as there was an occultism and mysticism in Israel prior to the Sepher Raziel and to the Zohar, so both were incorporated in the latter; both in the process underwent a species of transmutation, and as I venture to think the process, like that &quot;sea-change&quot; of the poet, produced something more strange and rich..

II. THE BOOK OF CONCEALMENT The Sepher Dzenioutha, the Book of Conceal ment or of Occultation, to which so much prominence has been given by occult writers, is not, therefore, as they occasionally seem to suppose, the beginning of the great cycle entitled the Zohar. In the Sulzbach edition, edited by Rosenroth, it begins at fol. i?6b and ends at fol. ij$b of the second volume. Most editions are either paged in correspondence with one another or refer readers to the pagination of the previous codices. Among early codices that of Lublinensis follows the Cremona edition, which, though used by Rosenroth for his references, was regarded by him as inferior to the simultaneous or slightly prior edition of Mantua. The latter he terms invariably Codex correctus. From the silence of occultists on the subject of the Zohar proper it might be judged that they do not regard it as of great occult importance ; but there is a simpler explanation, which, as seen, is not far to seek. The &quot; Book of Concealment,&quot; on the contrary, though small in its dimensions, is of the highest occult importance ; it is regarded as the root and foundation of the Zohar,* as it is generally understood, and also as the most ancient portion of that collection, which is almost * Mathers, &quot; Kabbalah Unveiled,&quot; p. 14."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"TTIu (Uttritten (SQorb of gUbitliem 213 provably correct.* It has been said further that it is a theogony comprised in a few pages, but with developments more numerous than the Talmud.f In a word, for occultists, the Book of Concealment and the Book of Formation are the fountain heads of all Kabalism.

For Sepher Deznioutha Rosen roth gives Liber Occulta- tionis.\\ The work is concerned with the manifestation of the Divine Being as the term of His concealment in the eternity which preceded manifestation. The first chapter deals with the development of the Vast Countenance, the image of the Father of all things, the Macroprosopus, when equilibrium had been established in the universe of unbalanced forces. This Countenance, which is referred to Kether, or the Crown, is compared by the Zoharistic commentators to the tongue of a balance, lingula exauiinis.

The Countenance, which no man knoweth, is secret in secret, and the hair of the head is like fine wool hanging in the equilibrium.

Macroprosopiis, although manifesting in the Crown, is still regarded as ever hidden and concealed, by way of antithesis in respect of Microprosopus, who is both manifest and unmanifest When the life- giving influx rushes forth from the Ancient One, amid the intolerable refulgence of that great light the likeness of a head appears. The distinction between the two Countenances is the distinction of the profile and the full face, for whereas the God of reflection is manifested fully, the Great Countenance is only declared partially, whence it is perhaps inexact * Compare Bk. ii. 4, where it is stated that AHIH is referred to Kether, i.e., as representing the world of ,-//// Soph ; and the Tetra- grammaton to Atziluth generally.

THE GREATER HOLY SYNOD The Book of Concealment has been simplified to the utmost in the preceding account. It may be now added that it is anonymous ; it quotes no rabbinical writers and has no references by which a clue to its date may be obtained. It has, however, two characteristics which give it the appearance of a much older document than those which follow it immediately, and are designed, as already said, to develop and expound it. These are its rudeness and the mutilations which it would appear to have undergone. The first translator, Rosenroth, supplies the gaps and omissions thus occasioned by con jectural words and passages placed within brackets, but even with these it is in an exceedingly faulty state. The treatise now under consideration is in most respects entirely different. It possesses almost a literary aspect, begins in narrative form, methodises the ensuing dialogues in a manner which is perfectly explicit and stands in need of few emendations. It deals, of course, with the barbarous symbolism of the preceding book and so far is admittedly repellent to modern taste, a fact which has been noted by at least one sympathetic critic who was himself an elegant and highly suggestive writer.* The first point which otherwise calls for notice is that the Greater Sacred Synod claims Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai as the author of the &quot; Book of Concealment,&quot; and itself contains the discourses of this Master in Israel, delivered in a * Eliphas Levi, I.a Clef des Grands Mysterts."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"218 ^he Jlxrrtiitu anb fit*ratnre of the Jiabalah field beneath trees in the presence of his disciples, namely, Rabbi Eleazar, his son, Rabbi Abba, Rabbi Jehuda, Rabbi Josi, the son of Jacob, Rabbi Isaac, Rabbi Chiskiah, the son of Rav, Rabbi Chia, Rabbi Josi and Rabbi Jisa. These are historical names belonging to the period which succeeded the destruction of Jerusalem. For an account of Rabbi Simeon himself we must have recourse to tract Sabbath of the Talmud, Babylonian recension, which contains the narrative which I will here give in its substance : &quot; On a certain occasion R. Jehudah, R. Josi and R. Shimeon were sitting together, and with them also was Jehudah, the son of proselytes. R. Jehudah opened the conversation, saying, How beautiful are the works of this nation (the Romans). They have established markets ; they have built bridges ; they have opened bathing-houses. Whereupon R. Josi was silent. But R. Shimeon ben Jochai answered, saying : All these things have they instituted for their own sake. Their markets are gathering-places for harlots ; they have built baths for their own enjoyment, and bridges to collect tolls from those who cross them. Jehudah, the son of proselytes, repeated this conversation, and it came to the ears of Caesar, who proclaimed : * Jehudah, who extols us, shall be extolled ; Josi, who said nothing, shall be exiled to Saphoris (i.e., Cyprus) ; Shimeon, who has disparaged us, shall be put to death.

In this wise they spent twelve years in the cave, when Elijah came to the opening, and said : Who will inform the son of Jochai that Caesar is dead and his decree is annulled? Hereupon they left the cave.&quot;* The secret wisdom embodied in the Zohar is supposed to have been the fruit of the long seclusion enforced upon R. Simeon by the Roman decree. The Talmud mentions expressly the learning obtained during this period, but without specifying its kind, According to the tradition of the Kabalists the &quot; Book of Concealment &quot; was the first form in which it was reduced to writing.

In an account like the present, which does not even pretend to be synoptic, it is impossible to attempt a tabulation of the singular typology with which the Greater Synod is concerned, and it should be noted in this connection that the few modern writers on Kabalism who claim to speak magisterially and from within an occult circle of knowledge, may have shown us glimpses in one or two rare instances of the system on which the typology is constructed, but have done nothing to elucidate and therefore to recommend it to our understanding. It is a question which it is hard to approach from the side of the literal sense, and to the occult student, in the absence of initiation, the esoteric aspects of the literature are chiefly a subject of curious speculation. Fortunately it has other aspects which make it deserving of considera tion, or there would be no purpose in the present inquiry. The unbalanced forces of the universe, the world in its void state, are considered under the symbolism of the kings who reigned in Edom before a king was raised up to rule over the children of Israel, that is to say, before the emanation of Microprosopus* * The Kabalah represents the present universe as preceded by others which passed away quickly.

So also when the &quot; Greater Synod &quot; represents the Ancient of Ancients creating and producing the essence of light, the same inter preter, who speaks with the authority of immense knowledge, as regards at least the literature of Kabalism, observes that the reference is to the Law,* in other words, to the letters of the alphabet, by the transpositions of which the Law was recorded subse quently.

A specimen of the original text may, however, be given in this place, separated from many technicalities which would be burdensome to the beginner. &quot; All souls go up with the revolutions or windings [that is, are subjected to the law of transmigration], but the children of man do not know the ways of the Holy One ; they know not how He judges the children of man every day in all time, how the spirits (Neskamotk, the higher soul, anima animce of Christian theology) ascend to be judged before they descend into this world, or again how they go up to judgment after that they have departed from this world ; to how many revolutions and mysterious ordeals they (or their essential substances) are subjected by the Holy Blessed One ; how many naked souls and how many naked spirits enter the other world, yet not through the King s curtain ; how many worlds revolve with them and how the world itself turns about in many concealed wonders.

The basis of the doctrine is set forth as follows in the &quot; Discourse of the Ancient One &quot; : &quot; When the child of man is born into this world there is appointed to him animated life (Nepkesh) from the side of the animals, the clean side, from the side of the Holy.

It is not to be supposed that when Kabalism divides and subdivides the soul it means anything else than to distinguish certain essences and qualities therein ; in a word, it means what it says, just as modern theosophy does at the present day when it affirms seven principles in man. The concealed sense of the Zohar, as before indicated, is simply the extraction of some method from its vast and confused mass, whichat first sight appears altogether delirious. In the present instance it will be seen that the animistic nature of man has a sevenfold aspect, whereas other Kabalistic dicta really extend it to ten. When these discrepancies are harmonised we have the concealed sense of the Zohar as to the inner nature of man. Perhaps we might reach it by supposing that the discourse of Elias really describes the development of mystic experiences in seven stages, ending, as it states literally, in the communication of the divine to man. * Zohar, ii. 94^, Brody ed."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"234 ^he 5oxtrtne anfc iEiterature of the giabalah VI.

Isaac Delates, that unknown but &quot; highly learned Jew un surpassable in all the branches of knowledge required,&quot; whom the publisher describes. In this case, they have no connection with Moses de Leon. There is, of course, little unanimity in hostile or indeed any Kabalistic criticism. As, on the one hand, a defender of the Zohar challenges the Bahir excerpts, so the latter have been exalted as the prototype and actual inspirer of the former work. This view, though in any case of little moment, involves the existence of the Bahir prior to the alleged date about which the Zohar was produced out of the head of Moses de Leon, like Minerva out of the head of Jupiter, ready made and at one leap. Morinus, who has left perhaps the most sensible review of the subject, founds his opinion that the Bahir was a product of the thirteenth century, on the silence of writers prior to that date, and especially of Moses Nachmanides, a Kabalistic Jew of Jerusalem, whose literary labours belong to the period before and after 1250, According to Wolf the first reference to the Bahir is made by R.

As regards their authenticity, Franck classes these excerpts along with those of the Bahir, but, as in that instance so in this, he gives no account of his suspicions, which may be taken, however, to follow from his conviction that much of the Zohar is really attributable to the period of Simeon ben Jochai and the disciples that came after him. In either case, the &quot; Discourse of the Faithful Shepherd &quot; contains much that is important to our purpose. Its views on vicarious atonement and on the Messiah to come will enable us to appreci ate further the value of the occult standpoint ; some of its moral teachings will illustrate its ethical position ; its references to the Shekinah will cast light on this curious feature of Kabalism ; and its specula tions on angels and demons will show the Zoharistic foundation for the later system of pneumatology which was developed by Isaac de Loria. The discourse introduces two phases of vicarious atonement, the one effected through the suffer ings of just men and the other by means of the Messiah. &quot; When the righteous are afflicted by disease or other sufferings in atonement for the sins of the world, it is so ordered that all the sinners of their"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"248 ^he Jtortdne anb literature of the giabalah generation may obtain redemption. How is this demonstrated? By every member of the physical body.

It is chastised by the blood being drawn from it, which ensures healing in all the other members of the body. It is in like manner with the children of the world ; the members are in relation with each other even as those of the body. When the Holy Blessed One willeth the health of the world, He afflicts a just man therein with pain and sickness and heals the rest through him. How is this shown ? It is written : But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed (Isa. liii. 5). By his stripes, as by the bruises [incisions] made in bleeding the arm, are we healed, that is, recovery is insured to us as members of one body.&quot;* Here, it will be said, the Kabalah recognises the great and fruitful doctrine of the solidarity of humanity. That is quite true, and it is one of those instances wherein Jewish theosophy has forestalled modern ideas. But if we take the illustration which it gives, we shall see that it is fantastic in character ; the affliction of a diseased rabbi does not as a fact benefit his neighbour physically, and only on the most arbitrary hypothesis can we suppose that the patience with which he may suffer will reflect credit * Zohar, Cremona ed., part iii. fol. ioia."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"dMrittcu 8$lorb of gUbaliem 249 on any one but himself. It would be barely reason able to dispute about such a position were it not necessary to show occultists the real messages of the Kabalah on points with which they are concerned. Now the modern students of occult philosophy every where reject with disdain the doctrine of vicarious atonement. Let us pass thence to the question of Messianic atonement, concerning which it is said in the Vision of the Faithful Shepherd : &quot; This is also exemplified in the history of Job. For the Holy Blessed One, seeing that the entire foundation was sinful, and how Satan appeared to accuse them, said unto Him, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth* (Job i. 8), to save his generation through him?&quot; This may be illustrated by the parable of a shepherd who beheld a wolf approaching to rend his sheep and destroy them. What did this shepherd ? Being wise, he gave unto the wolf the strongest and stoutest bell-wether, even that which the flock was accustomed to follow, and while the wolf was bearing it away, the shepherd hurried with his sheep to a place of safety, and then returning rescued the bell wether from the wolf. So does the Holy Blessed One deal with a generation : He surrenders a righteous man into the power of the accuser for the salvation of the generation through him. But when such an one is strong like Jacob, it is said, A man wrestled with him (Gen. xxxii. 24).

Theologians have, I believe, found some trouble in locating the accuser of Job, and it is perhaps most accurate to say with the poet that &quot; He, too, is God s minister,&quot; but the Zoharic commentary on Job makes him in most respects a match for the Almighty, who must have recourse to a stratagem in order to save his people- The Kabalah on the problem of evil is therefore, in this place, neither illuminating nor reassuring; it is, in fact, crass and childish. &quot; The ancient pillars of the world [the intellectual luminaries of Israel] differ,&quot; says the same disquisition, as to the nationality of Job. One affirms that he was a righteous Gentile who was chastised for the atonement of the world. At a certain time R. Hammarumnah met the prophet Elijah and said to him : How is it to be understood that the righteous man suffers while the wicked one has joy of his life? He answered, saying, The just man of few sins receives his punishment for these in this world, and hence it is that he suffers here ; but the man whose sins are many, while his good deeds * Zohar, Cremona ed., part ii. fol. iool&amp;gt;."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"{jBrittm flHorb of gabaliem 251 are few, receives recompense for the latter in this world and hence has the joy of life.&quot;* In this instance the Kabalah offers an explanation which, shallow though it be, is identical with that accepted by some sections of Christian theology, by which, however, it is applied more mischievously. Thus, not only the sporadic good actions of those who are wicked habitually but all natural goodness can find their reward only in this world. The Kabalah is not disfigured by methodised enormities of this kind. There are times also in which it loses its .grotesqueness for a moment, and by some not unhappy reference to Scripture illustrates an elemen tary spiritual truth, as, for example, concerning the change necessary to sinners. &quot; Those who are oppressed with sin need a change of place, a change of name and a change in their actions, even as it was said unto Abraham : Get thee out of thy country (Gen. xii. i). Here is a change of place. And : Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham (Gen. xvii. 5). Here is a change of name. A change of deeds : he changed from his former evil actions to good actions.&quot;f The Christian mystic might develop the significance of this quotation in connection with the new name of the Apocalypse, the new name received in confirmation, ordination and the monastic and conventual life. Such analogies, though suggestive, are of slender value ; the change mentioned in the * Zohar, Cremona eel., part ii. fol. io6b.

The consequences of the first sin are thus described in the Faithful Shepherd. &quot; Come, see ! Had Adam not sinned man would have known not the taste of death before he ascended to the superior world, but having sinned he became acquainted with the taste of death before ascending to the world above. Through the sin of Adam the rational spirit (RuacJi) is separated from the body which remains in this world. It has to cleanse itself in the river of fire (Dan. vii. 10), to receive punishment, after which it goes up to the Garden of Eden, which is above the earth, and there are prepared for it other garments of light, in conformity with the appearance of the body in the present world ; it is clothed therein and therein is its habitation for ever.&quot;* This passage is important because it shows that Jewish theosophy has nothing better to offer us than the old Biblical instruction that sin &quot; brought death into the world and all our woes.&quot; It is not our purpose here to question that doctrine, but simply to demonstrate that the Zohar, where it is intelligible, does not improve on accepted religious instruction.

The Zoharistic speculations on the Shekinah have an air of mystic symbolism which would be perhaps naturally wanting in commentary upon ordinary doctrinal matters.

But the discourse of the Faithful Shepherd adds that all are one, that is, God is one with His manifestation. This may be illustrated by the much more interesting and spiritual doctrine of the Eucharist ; the bread is the vestment of Christ, the mode of His manifestation in His Church, but Christ, by the hypothesis of the doctrine, is one with the veil which He assumes. It is otherwise in man, says the Zohar. &quot; His body is earth, but the soul is called reason. The one is death, the other is life.&quot; This is the ascetic notion which modern occultism has agreed to reject. &quot; But the Holy Blessed One is life, and the Shekinah also is life. Whence it is written : She [meaning the Shekinah, but the Scriptual reference is to Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that can lay hold upon her&quot; (Prov. iii. 18). The Shekinah of Kabalism is not, however, merely the visible splendour which shone in the Holy of Holies.

The passage continues : &quot; As He is humble, so is the Shekinah humility ; as He is benevolent, so is she benevolence ; as He is strong, so is she the strength of all the nations of the world ; as He is the truth, so is she the truth ; as He is the prophet, so is she the prophetess ; as He is righteous, so is she righteous ness ; as He is King, so is she Queen ; as He is wise, so is she wisdom ; as He is intelligent, so is she His intelligence ; as He is the crown, so is she His diadem, the diadem of glory.

The Kabalah, as we have seen many times, is in some respects the very opposite of pantheism. Our quotations must close with a few references to the pneumatology of the Faithful Shepherd. They concern, firstly, the great Presence Angel Metatron, who is the sole occupant of the Briatic world, as the supernal Adam is of that of Alz^uth. He is the garment of Shaddai. According to some his form is that of a boy, while others ascribe to this angel a female aspect This shows a connection with the Shekinah, and indeed Metatron, with the difference of an added letter, signifies the cohabiting glory.f There is, secondly, some information con cerning Samae l, or Satan, and his wife Lilith.

THE HIDDEN THINGS OF THE LAW The extant morsels of this work are located by Rosenroth as follows in the Cremona edition : Part I., col. 221, 258, 262, 370. Part II., col. 250. Dr. Ginsburg has discovered others in the Amsterdam edition, to which his references are made. They traverse ground covered by other sections of the Zohar, such as the evolution of the Sephiroth, the emanation of the primordial light and so forth. In a word, the contents show nothing which need detain us long. As an example of the puerility and pre tensions of its exegesis, let us take the following passage : &quot; It is written, If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small (Prov. xxiv. 10). Thy strength ; this means, if his grasp on the Thorah become languid. In the day of adversity ; this means, when he so weakens his strength becomes small [thus changing the simple statement of Scrip ture into a foolish platitude.] What is meant by thy strength becomes small ? It means Ko-a h [the initials of words signifying the Throne of Glory]. Then the evil is expelled, so that it cannot come near man and cannot accuse him [the meaning seems to be that when a man does not weaken in adversity, his strength is like that of the right hand, the Throne of Glory being on the right of God]. But when man deviates from the Thcrah [or has a weak hold thereon], then the strength is the strength of the left hand, because that evil which is the left side rules over man and sets aside the Throne of f"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The ddlrittcu &amp;lt;lorb of giabftliam 257 Glory.&quot;* On the whole, we shall most of us prefer to conclude simply with Solomon that giving way in the day of adversity is a sign of weakness. Those who prefer the Mysteries of the Thorah have full opportunities for entering more deeply into the significance of Solomon s homely aphorism, for they have only to remember that the Throne of Glory is a title of Tiphereth , and of MalkutJi occasionally because it is the seat of Tiphereth. In a more notable passage, which is supposed by Myer to distinguish certain stages of mystic vision, it is said that the will of the King is discovered in three colours. The first is above and so far away that no eye can perceive it in its purity, but it is distinguished (dimly) by contracting the range of vision [/.*., by the closing of the eyelids, as in blinking]. The second colour is seen with one eye shut, and cannot be seen by the other eye except when that eye is shut so that it can see little, as in blinking. The clearness of the light could not be endured otherwise. Of this it is written, What seest thou ? [Jer. i. u. The prophet, however, did not see the will of God but a branch of an almond-tree]. The third colour is that bright luminous mirror which cannot be looked into at all, except between the rolling of the eyes when the lids are altogether closed and they move in their sockets. There can then be seen in that rolling the light of the luminous mirror, and the colour thereof can be comprehended only by him who beholds the shining with eyes shut, whence it is written, The li.md of the Lord was upon me (Exck. xxxvii. i), and The * Ibid., part i. fol. 890."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"258 ^he Iportrinc ub JJitemture of the giatmlah hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening (Jbid. xxxii. 22).* No doubt the Kabalists had visions and means of inducing visions, as also had Boehme, St. John of the Cross and all the seers and mystics, but this clumsy process confuses cause and effect, while it offers no intelligible result. As another example, let us see what the Mysteries of the Thorah can tell us of the three angels who appeared to Abraham. &quot; It is written, And lo, three men stood by him (Gen. xviii. 2). These are three angels, clothed in ether, which came down to this world, and were seen in appearance even as a child of man. And they were three like that above, because the rainbow is only seen in three colours [this point should interest ethnologists]. Surely this is so. And these are three men ; three colours, white, red and green. The white is Michael, because he is the right side ; the red is Gabriel, because he is the left side ; and the green is Raphael. And these three colours are those of the rainbow, because it is never seen otherwise than with them. Hence it is written, And the Lord appeared unto him [Abraham] in the plains of Mamre (Gen. xviii. i), that is, the Shekinah revealed itself in these three colours. It is also written, And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament (Dan. xii. 3). They shall shine with a light which is enkindled by igniting a splendour. That brilliant light which is hidden, the spark of all sparks, of all lights, is therein invisible and hidden, concealed and made known, seen and not beheld.

The explanations of Christian interpreters may not be wholly satisfactory, but they are much better than the Zohar in any instance, and more especially in that section which dissolves the mysteries of the Thorah by a process of multiplication. As a specimen of the demonology in the Sithrai Thorah one quotation may be appended : &quot; When man joins himself with the truth, that is, the Thorah, he requires proving in the same place where his father was put to the proof ; so shall he ascend perfect and shall return perfect. Adam went up, but, not watching over himself, he was enticed by that harlot, even the first serpent, and sinned with her [i.e., Lilith]. It is written, And Jacob passed out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran (Gen. xxviii. 10). And went toward Haran, that is, the side of the harlot, which is a mystery. From the strength of Isaac, that is, from the strength of judgment, from the lees of old wine, went out a spark which comprised male and female, and it spread itself out to many sides and into many paths.

THE SECRET COMMENTARY We know that Scott provided headings to very many chapters of his romances by pretended quota tions from old plays which existed only in his imagination, and it occasionally happened that these mythical excerpts contained stronger lines than much of his acknowledged versecraft. Those who believe that Moses de Leon wrote the Zohar out of his own head will account in a similar manner for the manifold fragments of unknown treatises which are found only in that work. Of some of these it may also be said that they are more interesting than the Zohar proper. As we have seen, the whole world of Kabalism has agreed to exalt the &quot; Book of Concealment &quot; over all the other discourses attributed to Simeon ben Jochai, but for the purposes of our present inquiry it must be confessed that considerable interest attaches to the &quot; Secret Commentary.&quot; The extant fragments of this work are found in the Cremona edition at the following places : Part L, col. 257, 260, 261, 264, 265, 268, 269, 272, 273, 276, 296, 370.

We have learned in the Mathnuthah Kadmoah that because the higher soul [Neshamah] dwells in its perfection in the upper place [i.e., prior to birth], it has no desire towards the body except to create from it other similar souls [Neshamoth]. These come out of her, but she abides in her place. Thereupon R. Simeon ben Jochai stood up and explained : If in this world which is vanity, into this body which is a fetid particle, the Neshamah yet enters, verily, in the time to come, when all are made clean, when the body will be in the fulness of its perfection, the perfect Neshamah will enter therein, in the world above.

Isaac said : The Neshamah goes straight to the place prepared for it in Paradise.&quot; * In another part of his discourse the same Rabbi distinguishes two Edens and two places of per dition : &quot; The Holy Blessed One not only created a paradise on earth and a Gehennon on earth, but a garden of Eden above, and a Gehennon above. He created a garden of Eden on the earth below, as it is written, And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden (Gen. ii. 8). He created also a Gehennon on the earth, as it is written, A land of darkness, as darkness itself (Job x. 22). In like manner he created a garden of Eden above, as it is written, But the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God (I. Sam. xxv. 29). And it is again written, The Spirit shall return unto God who gave it (Eccles. xii. 7).

The next point upon which we may seek infor mation from the occult commentary is that of retri butive justice in the world to come : &quot; R. Judah said, The time of a man s departure from this life is the day of the great judgment, for then the Neshamah separates from the body. But man does not depart from this world until he has beheld the Shekinah. Hence it is written, There shall no man see me and live (Ex. xxiii. 20). Three angels come with the Shekinah to receive the Neshiimah of the righteous. Hence also it is written, And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : as he sat in the tent-door in the heat of the day (Gen. xviii. i). That is, the day of judgment, which burns even as an oven for the separation of the Neskamah from the body. And he lift up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him, who search the deeds which he has done, and through whom he confesses, yea, even with his mouth. When the Neshamnh sees this, it parts from the body as far as the opening of the gullet and there tarries until it has confessed all things whatsoever which the body has committed with her in this world. Then the Nashamah of the righteous man rejoices over her deeds [the higher soul is presented by the Kabalists under a feminine aspect] and because she has been so faithfully preserved.&quot; R.

According to this the Christian soul, whatever sentence is about to be pronounced upon it, sees Christ, as the soul of the Jewish Kabalist sees the glory of the presence. We find, therefore, that the Zohar at its best has no richer gift to offer us than a variation upon all that which the occultist has agreed to set aside as belonging to the letter and the convention. It is, perhaps, superfluous, as to the Kabalist it is certainly useless, to point out that the apparition of the angels to Abraham in the plains of Mamre can by no natural process of exegesis bear the construction placed on it. It is understood, of course, that the Kabalah has no such processes. Having seen how the soul is judged, another quotation will afford us some vague notion of the future happiness of the righteous : &quot; R. Joseph said : At that time the just man shall attain full knowledge ; namely, in the day when the Holy Blessed One shall rejoice over His works, the just shall know Him in their hearts, and their under standing shall be as great as if they had seen Him with the eyes, for it is written : And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God (Isa. xxv. 9).

This is what is meant by the good which is preserved for the just in the world to come. Hence it is written : These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham s son (Gen. xxv. 19). This refers to the NeshamaJi which deserves such joy and is perfect in her elevation. * Abraham begat Isaac, (Jbid.), that is, the soul brought forth this rejoicing and cheerfulness in the world. R. Yehudah said unto R. Cheyah : This have we learned that there is a feast which the Holy Blessed One will prepare for the righteous in the coming time. What is this feast ? He answered him : When I came before those holy angels, even the lords of learning, I knew only this which ye have heard, but afterwards I received the explanation through R. Eleazar, who said : The feast for the righteous in the coming time will be thus, as it is written : They saw God and did eat and drink (Ex. xxiv. 11). Now these are the foods, even as we have been taught. And R. Eleazar said again, We. have learned in one place, We have rejoiced, and in another, We have been fed. What is the difference? Thus spake R.

As to the duration of punishment, the opinions expressed in the Zohar are confused if not conflicting, but it does not seem to be everlasting. J Two other passages in the Secret Commentary refer to the resurrection of the dead : &quot; R. Isaac spake and said : The mandrakes give forth a smell (Song of Solomon vii. 13). Our rabbis have learned : In the time which is to come the Holy Blessed One will quicken the dead and will awaken them from the dust, that they be no more an earthly habitation. Formerly they were created from the dust of the earth, which hath no permanence, as it is written : And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground (Gen. ii. 7). But in that time they shall be sifted from the dust of that building and shall stand a firm building, and the same shall be unto them a lasting habitation.

Isaac added ; Do not call it mandrakes [Dudaim} but friendship \\Dodini\\, meaning that body and soul are friends and companions to each other. R. Na hman said : This word truly means Dudaim, for the Dudaim [understood as the love-apple] bring forth love in the world. What does this mean ? They give a pleasant smell. It describes the rectitude of their deeds, through which their Creator becomes known and comprehended by their generation. * And at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old (Song of Solomon vii. 13).

The theory of the risen body in the &quot; Secret Commentary &quot; recalls also that which was much better expressed by St. Paul when he said : &quot; It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.&quot; * Zohar, Cremona ed., part i. fol. 80."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"c&lrittcn SBorb of gabalicm 269 The other passage is as follows : &quot; While the Neshamah has its nourishment from the supernal splendour, the Holy Blessed One says to the angel Dumah : Go and proclaim to that body that I am prepared to quicken it at the time when I shall raise up the just in the age which is to come. But the body answers : Shall I have pleasure when I have decayed? [Referring to Gen. xviii. 12 where Sarah says : After I have waxed old, shall I have pleasure ?] Even when I have decayed in the dust, and have dwelt in the earth where worms and moles have eaten my flesh, shall it be possible for me to be renewed ? Then the Holy Blessed One says unto Neshamah : It is therefore written : And the Lord said unto Abraham . . . is anything too hard for the Lord? (Gen. xviii. 13, 24).

THE ADDITIONS The small additional pieces which pass under the generic name of Tosephtha, i.e., additauienta, or accessions, are scattered through the Cremona folio as follows : Part I. col. 83, 87, 145, 176, 188, 189, 203, 222, 259, 265, 295, 303, 318, 367, 371, 487, 513 ; Part II. col. 48, 107, 120, 163, 238, 358, 426 ; Part III. col. 50,82,97,98, 117, 149, 155, 163, 177, 184, 1 86, 191, 274, 331, 441. Some of these fragments arc addressed more particularly to proficients in the secret things of Kabalistic doctrine. Perhaps the most curious of all concerns the Treasury of Souls situated in the supernal Eden. &quot; Before the world was created all the spirits of the just [i.e., the rational spirits, the Ruachin] were"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"272 ^hc jportritte anb literature of the Jiabalah hidden before Him in thought, each in his likeness [i.e., they existed in the divine thought, possessing characteristic individuality].

He then gathered them into a treasury in the supernal garden of Eden, and that treasury is never filled, but cries out for ever : * Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare (Isa. xlii. 9). What does this mean ? It means, I show forth all by their name, and this treasury hath neither desire nor appetite, save only to accumulate souls therein [the word here used signifies the higher soul, or third principle of the Kabalists], even as Gehennon, which hath neither desire nor lust, save only to take souls and to purify them, calling daily, Give !

This means the animal nature [Nephesh} which is the higher life [i.e., Chaiah, meaning possibly the Nephesh of ChaiaJi, the fourth principle of the Kabalists ; according to one classifica tion, Cliaiah is referable to Chokmah in the Sephirotic system].

There is also extant an allegorical commentary* which has been twice printed, and yet another, attributed to the fourth century. C. THE MANSIONS OR ABODES We have already made acquaintance with a work anterior to the appearance of the Zohar in which there is a methodical description of heaven. It must not be confused with the excerpts which, under the above title, termed in the original HIKLVTh, rendered Palaces by Rosenroth, give account of the structure of Paradise and the infernal region. Their places in the Cremona edition will be found in Part I., col. 116 et seq. ; Part II., col 358 et seq., and col. 438. The mansions are seven in number and were the original habitations of the earthly Adam. After the fall of man they were reconstituted and became the abode of the saints. The term which signifies Mansion, Temple or Palace, is applied to Malkuth, in which Tiphereth is said to be concealed as in a palace. So also the name Adonai [ADNI], Lord, is the Palace of Tetra- grammaton, because it is the same number as H\\iL,=Palatium=6$. This name is attributed to Binah, and in an especial manner to Kether, on the authority of the Zohar proper, for HIKL, Palace, is the place in which HKL, that is, the * Commentatio Allegorica super quinque parvos Libellos, videlicet, Canticus Canticorum, Liber R^ith, &c.

The palace of the Holy of Holies corresponds, says Rosenroth, to the three supernals. The Zohar proper has also a good deal to tell us concerning the seven heavens, one above the other, like the layers of an onion. &quot; Each heaven trembles with fear of its Lord, through whom they all exist and all are taken away. Over all the Holy Blessed One holds all in His power.&quot; There are also seven earths below, arranged after the same manner. &quot; These earths are disposed according to their names, and between them is the Garden of Eden and Gehenna.&quot; They are inhabited by creatures of whom some have four faces, some two, while others are single visaged, like humanity. They are not the children of Adam ; some of them are clothed in skins and others in shells, &quot; like the worms which are found in the earth.&quot; It would serve no purpose to enlarge upon monstrous inventions of this kind. The concealed meaning which some occultists suppose them to possess is again evidently the plan upon which they are based, and to understand them is to know the method by which they can be calculated out, so to speak. In neither case are they justified to reason.

THE SECRET OF SECRETS The single fragment which is extant of this treatise is found in Part II. of the Cremona edition, beginning at col. 134. It treats, firstly, of the con nection between the soul and the body, of which a sufficient idea has been conveyed by previous quota tions ; and, secondly, of physiognomy, which, no doubt, in a certain manner connects with the lower divisions of occult science, but is not of much importance to our inquiry. It may, however, be worth while to say that Kabalistic physiognomy proves, as might be expected, to have no connection whatsoever with any accepted principles to which this empirical art may be supposed to have attained, and is, indeed, purely arbitrary and conventional. Lavater was something of a mystic, but fortunately for his subject, he borrowed nothing, as probably he knew nothing, of the Zohar and its connections. Four general types of the human countenance are dis tinguished, and these are referred to the faces of the four living creatures in Ezekiel s vision. We have thus the leonine, the bovine and the aquiline types, and another, less easy to characterise, but correspond ing to the &quot; living creature &quot; which &quot; had the likeness of a man.&quot; The approximation of any individual to a given type depends upon his intellectual and moral rank.

Gabriel Delanne, the latest and perhaps most accomplished writer on the French theory of reincarnation, would say that the Zoharic fragment here refers undoubtedly to the perisprit of the Kardec school of spiritism, which he holds to be the plan or type upon which the body of the man is fashioned. The &quot; Secret of Secrets &quot; also pretends that every feature in a given countenance indicates to those who can read therein whether it is possible or not for the possessor to be initiated into divine mysteries.* It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that the fragment does not disclose the rules which governed the sages in their discernment, so that the Kabalah is not likely to be of much practical use to the few occultists who may be inclined to include physiognomy within the charmed circle of the secret wisdom.

II., comprised in a few columns, 91 et * In the writings of the Gaon R.

Hammnuna, but living at the period in question with his widowed mother in a certain village. One day two disciples of R. Simeon ben Jochai, namely, R. Isaac and R. Judah, passed through this village on a journey and paid a visit to the widow. When her son returned from school she wished to present him to the rabbis to receive their blessing, but he declined to approach them, after the unamiable manner of prodigies. The reason assigned by the narrative is that he discerned by the odour of their garmenls that they had not recited the requisite &quot; Hear, O Israel ! &quot; in honour of the unity of God. He did not, however, disdain to converse at the table, delivering sundry discourses (i) On the symbolism of washing the hands, a function of some mystery, because it is written, So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not (Ex. xxx. 21), that is, Aaron and his sons, when entering the tabernacle of the congregation ; (2) On grace before meat ; (3) On the Shekinah ; (4) On the utterance of Jacob, &quot; The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads&quot; (Gen. xlviii. 16) ; and on other matters. The cautious critic will not be prepared to deny that the invention of this history was beyond the genius of R. Moses de Leon. However, the discourses con vinced the disciples of Simeon ben Jochai that such a precocious youth could not be the child of human parents, and the great light of Kabalism, when the remarks were repeated to him, coincided with this opinion."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"(SHritten fillorb of gabalism 279 Our analysis of the Zohar, regarded as a literary document, has reached its utmost limit, and this specimen of the matters not included in the Mantua recension must be held to serve for the whole. Though he regarded the Mantua edition as Codex correctus, Rosenroth ingarnered all the tracts and fragments embraced by that of Cremona when he produced his own careful codex ; but it must be remembered that the Zohar had in all probability grown under the hands of transcribers and makers of glosses during the space, approaching three centuries, which elapsed between its first promulgation and the date when it was first printed. We have no means of knowing how much of it was actually contained in the script of Moses de Leon. The suspicion under which it has remained may be partly accounted for by its frequent quotation of unknown works which have been considered fictitious ; but the Zohar was edited prior to the persecution of the Jews inaugurated by the atrocious edict of Ferdinand and Isabella, and many documents existing in Spain may have been destroyed during that fiery epoch. Again, it is impossible to say that Continental libraries contain no MSS. by which ths excerpts of the Zohar might be justified. The unprinted literature of Jewry has been catalogued by various bibliographers, but no critical knowledge of its contents is possible by recourse to bibliographies. Let us take, for example, the passages from a commentary on the Canticle of Canticles, which is peculiar, as we have seen, to the Cremona editio princeps.

XI. THE ANCIENT AND LATER SUPPLEMENTS The sudden appearance in public of a work which either has or purports to have remained in concealment for several centuries may be expected to lead to the discovery or manufacture of continuations or con nections thereof, and thus we have two series of Zoharic writings subsequent to the Book of Splendour and distinguished as its ancient and later supplements.

I should add, however, that considerable importance and authority have been always ascribed by Kabalists to the Ancient Supplements, and according to Franck they have been known as long as the Zohar itself. They contain explanations of the term BRAShlTh by R. Simeon ben Jochai after seventy different ways, and hence the work is divided into seventy chapters, with eleven further chapters added at the end. It was printed by Jacob ben Napthali at Mantua in 1557 under the editorship of Immanuele di Benevento, and appeared again at Cracovia. Among notable matters in these Ancient Supple ments we find the attribution of the members of the human body to the Sephiroth, whence the practical magic of the West may have obtained later on its notion of divine and angelic names ruling those members.* The apex of the head and brain is referred to Kether, the brain as a whole to Chokinah, the heart to Binah, the back and breast are attributed to Tiphercth, the arms to Chesed and Geburah, the legs to Netzach and Hod, the generative organs to Jesod, the feet to Malkuth. Later Kabalism recognises other corres pondences, the arbitary nature of which is obscured sometimes by an appearance of methodical precision.

One of the most celebrated quotations from the Ancient Supplements is, however, the Prayer of Elijah, though it belongs only to the prefatory part.* &quot; Lord of the universe, one alone art Thou, but not according to number.

To mention them in this place will be therefore sufficient, and we may proceed at once to the consideration of the commentaries and developments to which that work gave rise, and to the names, illustrious in later Kabalism, which are connected with these. A. MOSES OF CORDOVA Assuming that the Zohar first became known in Spain towards the end of the thirteenth century, there was a lapse of two hundred and fifty years, according to the dates fixed by modern scholarship, before any literature followed from it. Hence this literature may be largely regarded as a consequence of the Cremona and Mantua editions.

On the other hand, Bartolocci* and Basnagef agree in assigning Moses of Cordova to the fourteenth century. The earlier date is of importance to the history of Kabalism, because certain side issues of documentary criticism^ untouched in this study, depend upon it. Here I need only say that Franck does not state his authority or indeed his reason for accepting the later period. In either case Moses of Cordova is the first commentator on the Zohar, for, assuming that Bartolocci was mistaken and that Basnage reproduced his error, Joseph Gigatella, called the divine Kabalist and thaumaturge, who was of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, was a writer on the Sephiroth, and connects with the Sepher Yetxirah rather than the Zohar, though he refers to the Kabalistic Work of the Chariot As his name indicates, Moses of Cordova was a Spaniard, but he travelled to Palestine, and it is conjectured that he was instrumental in founding the Academy of Sapeth in Upper Galilee, nine miles from Bethsaida. In either case he was one of teachers and helped to make it illustrious, for he was regarded by his fellow theosophists as the greatest light of Kabalism since Simeon ben Jocliai. Franck says that he adhered to the real significance of the original monuments of Kabalism, but, althnu-1, this appears worthy of praise, he sec-ins t&amp;lt; complain that R.

When a man who has performed many good works finally falls away from righteousness and is lost, what becomes of his earlier works ? Though the sinner may perish, they, says R. Moses, remain. If, therefore, there be a just man walking in the ways of the Supernal King, yet wanting something of his vestments, God will supply the deficiency from the good works of the impious one.

However, he died at Sapheth or Separth, having published nothing himself, though some suspected treatises are attributed to him. The substantial authenticity of the great body of his doctrines collected by his disciple, R.

The Ltber Drushtm is a metaphysical introduction to the Kabalah, which discusses a variety of subtle and abstruse questions much after the manner of the scholastic philosophy, and there is no doubt that Isaac de Loria would have diffused a great light of reasoning at Salamanca had he been a Christian Doctor instead of a Jewish Rabbi. His first point, as he tells us, is one over which the Kabalists, late and early, had already outwearied themselves, namely, for what reason were the worlds created and was their creation of necessity ? Assuredly from the period of the Angel of the Schools, the halls of Salamanca, of Padua, of Louvain and the other seats of scholastic learning, had echoed with this debate. Perhaps the Kabalists owed something to the Scholastics, perhaps they drew both from one another. In the early centuries of Christianity the so-called Areopagite offers curious points of contact with the system of Sephirotic emanation in the angelical world, and the Wisdom of the Exile was encompassed on all sides by the great debate of Christian speculation.

Let me indicate therefore the answer of Isaac de Loria, and perhaps some student at large among scholastic quartos will find illuminating parallels in the Scholastics.* The answer is that God cannot fail of perfection in all the works and names of His magnificence, His excellence and His glory ; but unless those works were brought from potentiality into act they could not have been termed perfect, as regards either the works or the names. The name Tetra&rammaton signifies perpetual existence, past, present and future, in the condition of creation before the creation, and thereafter in the immutability of things. But if the worlds had not been created, with all that is in them, it could not have thus signified the continuity of existences in every instant of time, and Tetragrammaton would have been an empty name. How very curious is the treachery of this reasoning, which ascribes to a name of the Deity an existence independent of the intelligent creatures whose convention it is ! But we should probably find many parallel treacheries among scholastic rcasoncrs, were there any one at hand to disinter them. So also the name of A,i\\ //&amp;lt;//, or the Lord, involves the idea of ministers or servants, and if there were no ministers God could not be called by this name.

The next point discussed by the Liber Drushini is why the world was created at the time and moment that it was. and not at an earlier, or, for that matter, at a later epoch. The answer is that the supreme and most excellent Light is infinite, exceeding com prehension and speculation, and that its concealed foundation is far from all understanding. Before any thing was produced by emanation therefrom, there was no time or beginning therein. This is the solution of the difficulty which is offered by all official theology, and it could have no aspect of novelty at the late period of Isaac de^Loria. It may be affirmed in a general way that when the Kabalists touch the common ground of speculation they seldom surpass their epoch in profundity or subtlety, I might add also in the adequacy of their views, though philo sophical sufficiency was not, of course, to be expected on any side. But it is not often and it is not for long that works like the Liber Drushim confine themselves to the common ground of speculation, and the Kabalist in this instance passes speedily into the transcendental region of the Sephiroth and the manner of their emanation, another question, as he tells us, which has involved all Kabalists in controversy.

These questions, says R. Isaac, are hard and difficult to resolve, but he offers a solution on the authority of the Zohar, namely, that before the order of things was instituted, they were disposed one over the other, but after that time in three pillars, those of Mercy and Severity, with the central column of which Kether is the summit and Malc/uit/i the base. In subsequent chapters the Sephiroth are con sidered under a dual aspect, namely, as regards the portion of the Divine Light contained in each and as regards the containing vessel, while these are again distinguished into an ambient and an inward Light, and an external and internal vessel. The existence of many worlds prior to the Sephirotic emanations is affirmed, herein following, as we have seen, both Talmudic and Zoharic tradition. Finally, several classifications of the Sephiroth are considered in the last chapter. The study of the Liber Drushim may be especially recommended to those occultists who have been taught to regard the Kabalah as a doctrine of certitude, whereas it is largely empirical, its leading theorems giving rise to as much disputation regarding their proper meaning as the principles of any other speculative philosophy. The commentary on the &quot;Book of Concealment,&quot; as might be expected, is written somewhat on the Incus a non lucendo principle.

On the authority of the Zohar, section Pekude, the balance symbol, which has made this treatise so famous in Kabalism, is explained to represent the Male and Female principles, which indeed follows from the developments of the Lesser Holy Synod.&quot; The male denotes Mercy, the right hand pillar of the Sephiroth, and the female Severity, the pillar on the left hand. These principles are termed the Father and the Mother, and in the Hebrew Alphabet are referable to Jod and Nun. The Father is perfect love and the Mother perfect severity. The latter had seven sons, namely, the Edomite kings, who had no foundation in the Holy Ancient One. These are empty lights dispelled by the source of lights concealed within the Mother. Male and female are conformations of the Holy Ancient One, corresponding to Kether, and repre sented mystically by three heads signifying : a, the Unmanifested Wisdom, which is so withdrawn that it is as though it were not, in contradiction to that which is manifested in the thirty-two paths ; b, the Supreme Crown, which is the Holy Ancient One ; and c, the Head which neither knows nor is known, namely, the A in Soph. Thus on the one side of Kcther is Chokmah, and on the other is the latens Deltas, and C/wkmah, or Wisdom, is the Father, while the Mother is the increment of Understanding, i.e., Binah.

In this manner the obscurities of Kabalism are at times redeemed by the simplicity of the lesson which is extracted from them. &quot; The Book of the Revolutions of Souls &quot; is no doubt a more fascinating treatise than an obscure exposition of so obscure a work as the Sepher Dzeniouthi, but it is also difficult to give account of it in a small space because the system which it develops is much involved, even for a Kabalistic work. The greatest importance has been attached to it by occultists like Eliphas Levi, who made no distinction between Zoharic and later doctrine. It will be therefore useful to see what is really involved in the famous treatise of Isaac de Loria. The basis of its scheme is the doctrine of the &quot; Book of Concealment &quot; and its expository synods, concerning the seven Edomitc kings who emanated and passed away prior to the production of the present universe. In these kings there was good as well as evil, and a separation was therefore made, that which was good being used for the material of the four Kabalistic worlds as they are now constituted.

A like origin is attributed to souls, and they are disposed similarly in the four worlds, some corre sponding to the Bride, some to Microprospus, some to the Father Supernal, some to the Supernal Mother, and some again to the Microprospus in the world of Assiah. The totality of these souls constitutes Psyche in Assiah, which in reference to the supernal per sonalities of that world has therefore five parts : the Psyche in the Psyche, or Nephesh of Assiah, the mundus factivus ; the medial spirit, or Ruach of the Psyche factiva ; the mem, or Neshamah ; the vitalitas, or Chaiah ; and the singularitas, individuality, or Jechidah, all belonging to the Psyche factiva, or Nephesh of Assiah. There is a similar distribution through the three superior worlds, Ruach and its five-fold division being referred to Yetzirah, Nesha mah to Briah, Chiah to Atziluth, and Jechida, possibly to the world of unmanifest Deity which is beyond Atziluth. Loria s system proceeds, however, upon a five-fold division of four principles only. Each of the five divisions are again attributed as follows in the Sephirotic scheme : I. Nephesh to Malkuth, the Kingdom, i.e., the Bride. II. Ruach to the Sephiroth of Microprosopus. III. Neshamah to the Mother, i.e., Binah. IV. Chiah to the Father, i.e., Chokmah. V.

Now these souls are those of the Israelites, who are the nnica in terrain. We must look elsewhere for the origin of the nations of the world. The recrements, the evil and rejected parts of the Edomite kings are the cortices or shells which compose the averse Adam Belial. But when the protoplasts partook of the forbidden fruit, their fall confounded the good with the evil of the cortices, that of Adam with the male shells of Samael or Adam Belial, and that of Eve with the evil of his bride Lilith, the spied tics of the serpent; for the serpent had commerce with Eve according to Isaac de Loria, which does not seem to be the consistent doctrine of the Zohar. It was after this fall that the nations of the world were produced from the shells. This is the doctrine which occultists accept by implication when they speak, as they do speak, of the connection between later Kabalism and the secret tiv.ditions on which their devotion is fixed.

From the time when the good and evil were thus confounded two things have been necessary (i) That the good man should be separated from the evil ; (2) That the portion of the good should be restored. The first is accomplished by the observation of the prohibitive precepts of the law, a nd the second by that of the affirmative. Both classes must be accomplished in all their number, and in thought, word and deed, by every soul, whose revolutions must therefore continue until the whole law has been fulfilled. This law must also be studied in each of its four senses, failing which the revolu tions of the deficient soul will again be prolonged. This scheme seems to apply exclusively to the Israelites, as the nations of the world can only be destined to return whence they came, and Adam Belial is obviously not under the law. The scheme, however, is subject to a certain mitigation, as revolution proper is sometimes replaced by status embryonatus. Revolution is the entrance of a soul into the body of an infant at birth to experience the pain and trial prepared for that body. The alternative condition is the entrance of a soul into the body of a grown man, who must be at least thirty years old,* i.e., when he is obliged to fulfil the precepts.

Four souls may revolve in one body, but not more, while the status cmbryomitns may associate three alien souls with a single man, but again no more. The object of all revolutions and all Kabalistic embryology is the return of the Israelites into the stature of the first Adam, all having been involved in his fall since he included all. Such is the Kabalistic doctrine of revolution according to Isaac de Loria. It is not pure Zoharic doctrine, nor is it any scheme of reincarnation peculiar to any school of occultism at the present day. In so far as it differs from the Zohar, it would be unreasonable to regard it as a fuller light of an old tradition ; it is very interesting and very curious, yet fitly described as a reverie, written by R.

J The greater part of the &quot; Royal Valley &quot; is therefore included in the Kabbala Denudata, the excerpts extending over several hundred pages. Its author belonged to the school of Isaac de Loria, and appears to have traversed a portion of the ground covered by the Lorian MSS. of R. Chai m Vital. We know these only, as we have seen, by the excerpts of Rosenroth, which are concerned so largely with the doctrine of spiritual essences. After the same manner that these develop and exaggerate Zoharic pneumatic teaching, so the &quot; Royal Valley &quot; extends Kabalistic cosmology, but not with as much extravagance. The mundus prior of Kabalism, i.e., the emanation of the seven Edomite kings, is termed the world of Nephesh, and it was destroyed with the souls belonging to it because evil prevailed therein. The actual world is that of Ruach, in which good and evil are confused, but good comes out of the evil and at last all shall be good. Then a new world shall suc ceed that of Neshamahy and this will be the Sabbath of grace. It follows, therefore, that the present order must pass away, and this is symbolised by the death of the second Hadad, the eighth Edomite king, as * Kabbala Demidata, Apparatus in Librum Sohar pars sectinad, i. 1 50 et seq. t Ibid. ii. 152 et seq. % Ibid. ii. partis secundce tractatus quartits^ p. 47 et seq."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The eiBrittfu &amp;lt;&lorb of |iabali0m 305 recorded in I.

The hypothesis of the creation of the world begins with the contraction of the Divine Presence, producing that space which is termed primeval air. &quot; Before the emanations issued forth and the things which are were created, the supreme light was infinitely extended. When it came into the Supreme Mind to will the fabrication of worlds, the issue of emanations and the emission as light of the perfection of His active powers, aspects and attributes, then that light was in some measure compressed, receding in every direction from a particular central point, and thus a certain vacuum was left in mid-infinite, wherein emanations might be manifested.&quot; It is to this treatise that Kabalism owes the curious conception of the evolution of the Sephir&amp;lt;-t/i by a process of explosion through the excess of light which distended them. From the fragments of the broken vessels originated the Four Worlds, the shells both good and evil, and myriads of souls.

We see, therefore, that, according to the late school of Kabalism, the first attempt at manifestation by the latens Deltas went utterly astray, and that the evil of the whole world is the result of the failure of God. This peculiar instruction is also found in the Talmud. D. ABRAHAM COHEN IRIRA This Portuguese Jew was another follower of the school of de Loria, but tinctured with the Platonic philosophy, which he sought to harmonise with Kabalism in his &quot; Gate of the Heavens,&quot;* as we have already seen. His other treatise is Beth Elohim, the &quot; House of God,&quot; containing three dissertations in exposition of the doctrines of Loria, but directly founded upon and citing at considerable length the pneumatological portions of the &quot; Faithful Shepherd,&quot; the Pekude section in the Zohar, and the &quot; Ancient Supplements&quot; of that work.f So much space has been given to Kabalistic psychology that it will be permissible to dismiss this writer in a few words. The first dissertation in the &quot; House of God &quot; rests chiefly on the utterances attributed to R.

Moses of Cordova concerning the connection of the angels with the celestial bodies, and concerning their physical vest ments. The second dissertation treats of the different angelical orders and the seven heavens, while the third deals with elementary spirits and the nature of the soul.

THE BOOK OF PURIFYING FIRE When a given order of mystic symbolism, possessing distinct objects and a sphere of application more or less defined, is applied to the purposes of another order, we may expect to derive some curious results from the analogy thus instituted if we can get to understand the method, though, as I have already indicated, this superincession of typology is usually somewhat dazing in its results. The treatise entitled jEsh Metzareph, which signifies Purifying Fire, is an instance of the application of Kabalistic apparatus to the purposes of alchemy, and is, so far as I am aware, the sole instance of its kind. In this connection we shall, however, do well to remember that Hermetic and Kabalistic philosophy are ascribed by the majority of authorities in occultism to a common source,* while the rabbicinical influence in alchemy is well illustrated by such legends as that * Thus Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes), see Book vii. 11, affirms in his Magia Adamica that the learning of the Jews, i.e., their Kabalah, was chemical, and that Flamel s &quot;Book of Abraham the Jew&quot; is the best proof thereof.

A few alchemical allusions are to be found in the Zohar, which recognises the existence of an archetypal gold, and regards the metals generally as composite substances. But these references are almost less than incidental, and it is needless to say that there is no occult chemistry, seriously speaking, in the great theo- sophical storehouse. The treatise on Purifying Fire is written in Aramaic Chaldee, which is the language of the Talmud and the Zohar.

THE MYSTERIES OF LOVE With the sole exception of Abraham Cohen Irira, the succession of Kabalistic writers whom we have thus passed in review never descended to the use of a vulgar tongue. To that exception we must now add the case of R. Juda, son of Isaac Abravanel, better known under the designation of Leo the Hebrew. I must confess that there is no reason of a necessary kind for his inclusion in an account of the chief documents of Kabalism ; he is exceedingly late, having been born in the kingdom of Castile shortly after the middle of the fifteenth century, and it is even stated that he broke away from all Jewish tradition by becoming a Christian. At the same time there are two points by which he is forced upon our notice ; in the first place, he is a favourite subject of allusion with occult writers, and cannot therefore be overlooked in a work which deals expressly with the occult interest in Kabalism ; in the second place, his dialogues on love have been more popular than any Kabalistic treatise. According to the best opinion, they were written originally in Italian and first appeared at Rome in the year 1535. They were reprinted at Venice in 1541. Then they were translated into Latin by Sarrazin, being published, according to Wolf, in 1564 at Vienna. This version, which has been praised for its elegance, was next included by Pistorius in his famous Artis Cabalisticce Scriptores, Basle, 1587.

Though he wrote, as it is said, in Italian, Abravanel was Spanish by birth, but was driven from his native country through the edict of Ferdinand and Isabella. This was in 1492. His first refuge was Naples, where he entered the king s service, but the king died and his realm fell into the hands of Charles VIII., after which the Spanish Jew again became a wanderer. Some say that he retired to Sicily, afterwards to Corfu and Ponilles, and, finally, to Venice, where he died in 1508. Others relate that he fixed his abode at Genoa, and there practised medicine with honour for a long period. As to the change, real or pretended, in his religious opinions there is also serious con fusion. Basnage says that he was a man of a mild nature who mixed familiarly with Christians, but inveighed against them in his writings, especially against the priests and the Pope.* Pistorius, on the other hand, represents him as a converted Jew.f He is the subject of high praise, based on intimate knowledge, in the bibliography of Bartolocci.J It must be confessed that the occult interest in Leo the Hebrew is not of an intelligible kind, and it is past speculation why he was included by * ///i/. iksjitifs, 1. vii. t. v. pp. 1898, 1899. t So also does Drach in his notice of the Kabalah in HHarmonie entre ?

The machinery of the dialogues, if they can be said to possess machinery, belongs to classical mythology ; the allusions, the illustrations, the images are echoes of the Greek and Latin poets ; when the philosophical authority is not Aristotle, it is Plato ; there is only one direct reference to the Kabalah in the whole three hundred folio pages which the dialogues occupy in Pistorius, and it is then a slender allusion to successive renewals of the world, which suggests that the author had misconceived the &quot; restoration &quot; of the &amp;lt; Book of Concealment.&quot; As against this there is not one trace of Hebrew thought or influence ; there is nothing which would lead us to suspect a Jewish authorship except such negative evidence as the similarly entire absence of any Christian reference.

It has many passages which even at the present day may be called delightful reading, and it is redeemed from the commonplaces of sentiment by tender suggestions of shallow allegory. The Philo and Sophia of the dialogue are enough by their mere names to suggest transcendentalism to an occult student, and more than one criticism has supposed it to be concerned wholly with the love of God. As a fact it discerns in all things the activity, the influence and the power of the master passion, and another of the secrets of its popularity in the warm-blooded world of the South, is that however much love is transcendentalised in the dialogues, it is always sexual. So also the philosophy of this love is the doctrine of delectation and felicity. Delectation is union with the beloved, and the good and the beautiful are identified in words that recall the light metaphysics of Cousin and the blessed life of Fichte. The general definition of love is that it is a vivifying spirit which permeates all the world, and a bond uniting the entire universe. But the proper definition of the perfect love of man and woman is the concurrence of the loving with the beloved to this end, that the beloved shall be converted into the lover.

God is loved in proportion as He is known, and as He cannot be known entirely by men, nor His wisdom by the human race, so He cannot be loved as he deserves, for such an exalted sentiment transcends the power of our will. The mind, there fore, must be content to know God according to the measure of its possibility and not that of His excellence. The knowledge and love of God are both necessary to beatitude, for He is the true intellectual agent with Whom consists felicity, which is not to be found in the knowledge of all things, but in the One alone who is Himself all others. This felicity does not consist in the act cognoscitive of God, which leads to love, nor in the love which succeeds such knowledge, but in the copulation of the most interior and united divine knowledge, for this is the sovereign perfection of the created intellect, the last act and happy end in which it finds itself rather divine than human. Such copulative felicity with God cannot, however, be continuous during our present life, because our intellect is here joined to the matter of our fragile body.

MINOR LITERATURE OF KABALISM We have now completed our study of all Kabalistic writings to which any currency has been given in connection with the claims of occultism, but we have by no means exhausted the literature either before or after the appearance of the Zohar. It has been classified in chronological order in a special list by Bartolocci at the beginning of his great work, and those who desire to pursue the subject further will there see how impossible it is to deal with in this place. It is, moreover, outside the purpose of our inquiry. A few names, however, may just be mentioned which are to some extent typical of the minor literature of Kabalism. When the Zohar was on the verge of the historical horizon, in the reign of Alphonso X., we find at Toledo Rabbi Mevi, the son of Theodore, Prince of the Levites of Burgos. Though a Kabalist and a light of Kabalism, he opposed Nachmanides, thus showing that at a comparatively early period there was little unanimity among the doctors of theosophy and the voices of tradition on"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"320 ^hc JBoxtriiu anfo jpiteratur* of the Jiabalah the subject of theosophy or tradition. His book is entitled &quot; Before and Behind,&quot; which is supposed to indicate that he had approached the Kabalah from every point of view.* Side by side with philosophical Kabalism the spurious practical part, the Ars Kabalistica, never wanted its professors. As neither worse nor better than the rest we may mention R. Chamai of Arragon, in the early part of the fifteenth century. One of his practical secrets was the determination of the sex of an unborn child by placing the nuptial couch from north to south, thus indicating respect for the majesty of God, which resided between east and west, and might suffer dishonour by marital intercourse taking place in the same direction. Such consideration, it was deemed, would not go without its reward in the birth of male children.f In the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, and a victim of their edict of expulsion, flourished Joseph Gikatella, called the divine Kabalist and the Thaumaturge, who wrote on the attributes of God, the Divine names, and the Sephiroth.% At the period of Picus de Mirandola Kabalists abounded in Italy, many of whom were refugees from persecution in Spain and Portugal. Picus in his Apologia affirms that his demonstrations of Christian dogma in Jewish theosophy effected the conversion of a Kabalist named Dattilius. As it is one of few instances on record the sincerity of the change may * Bartolocci, Bibliotheca Magnet Rabbinica, iv. 1 8 ; Basnage, Histoire desjuifs, v. 1773- t Bartolocci, Bibliotheca Magna Kabbinica, ii. 840 : Basnage, Histoire desjuifs, v. 1895.

Basnage hints that such an action at that period seemed scarcely less subversive in Israel than to embrace Christianity. On the other hand, Judas Azael, about the same period, contributed to the literature of the tradition by his &quot; Thrones of the House of David,&quot; a treatise dealing with the Fifty Gates of Understanding, while in Germany Nathan of Spire, better known, however, for a treatise in praise of the Holy Land, produced a Kabalistic commentary on Deuteronomy iii. 13, under the title of Mcgi ltn/i Hamncoth. In Holland, a few years previously, the famous Manasses composed his work on the resurrection of the body, which connects with Jewish esoteric theology by its defence of metempsy chosis ; and Isaac About, a Brazilian settled in the Low Countries, translated the Porta Ccelorum of Abraham Cohen Irira from the original Spanish into Hebrew.

While the traces of the philosophical tradition are nowhere met with in antiquity, that of magic abounds. It was to be expected that the newer order of ideas should become interfused with the older. But the Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar are not magic, and that which drew the Christian students of the literature and made them seek to fathom the Kabalistic mystery was assuredly its philosophical, transcen dental indeed, but not its thaumaturgic part. We are on the track here of another great misconception which prevails among the class of thinkers who have most reason to concern themselves with the claims of the Kabalah. It is useless for occult writers and their too easy disciples to continue, as they have done in the past, appealing to Christian authorities as to great names supporting their view of the subject. Those who accepted and those who vindicated the authenticity of the secret tradition had never dreamed of the religion behind all religions, nor did the^ look to the sanctuaries of Egypt for any light but that which perchance was carried into it by the descendants of Abraham.

The purpose of the brief studies which follow is to demonstrate these facts, which possess considerable importance for those whom I address, and are therefore an integral part of my scheme. They are not biographical sketches, and they are not biblio graphical notes. They are designed to exhibit that among the names commonly cited in connection with Kabalism, some should no longer be mentioned, some belong only to a Quixotic attempt at discovering an eirenicon for Christendom and Jewry, some are not worth citing, because, despite their imputed authority, they have nothing of moment to tell us, and some, a bare residuum, with a handful of recent writers, may be left on the otherwise vacated benches. II. RAYMOND LULLY The name of Raymond Lully has been usually cited as that of a considerable authority on the Kabalah, as upon several other departments of the secret knowledge.

This is therefore the personality which would naturally connect with Kabalism. The second Raymond Lully connects, however, exclusively with alchemy, and his works are evidence that he did not renounce the Christian faith.* It is to him must be attributed those keys, compendiums, testaments and codicils of alchemy which are found in all the great collections of Hermetic treatises. He was so far imbued with the apostolic spirit of his predecessor that his great ambition was to engage some Catholic monarch in another barren crusade for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. According to his legend he transmuted into gold sufficient base metal for the minting of six million nobles, for the benefit of an Edward, King of England, on condition that he assumed the Red Cross. The king did not keep his promise, and the adept escaped as he could from the extortion of further projections.

The doctor of Majorca does connect artificially with the esoteric tradition of the Jews, by the arbitrary use of certain words and methods, though he was not a proselyte of the gate, but his system is a mechanical introduction to the sciences, and has no title to the name, having nothing to do with a tradition, exoteric or esoteric, Jewish or Gentile.

The best that can be said for the Ars Magna is that it was discoursed upon by Cornelius Agrippa and that it was tolerated by Picus de Mirandola. And of these facts, at the present day, neither possesses a consequence. The chief philosophical mission of the first Raymond Lully was to protest against the school of Averroes ; his chief practical work was the exhortation of prelates and princes to found schools for the study of languages so as to facilitate the conversion of Kabalah to Christian Europe, for which there is no ground in fact ; he thinks that it would be difficult to determine how far Lully was &quot;an initiate of this mystic science &quot; or the precise influence which it exercised on his doctrine. &quot; I refrain from saying with a historian of philosophy (Tennemann) that he borrowed thence his belief in the identity of God and Nature &quot; (I think that Tennemann has here misconstrued his author), &quot; but it is certain that he had a very high idea of it, considering it a divine science, a veritable revelation addressed to the rational soul, and it may perhaps be permissible to suppose that the artificial pr&amp;lt; used by Kabalists to connect their opinions with the words of Scripture, such as the substitution of numbers or letters for ideas or words, may have contributed in no small degree to the invention of the Great Art.

Agrippa is therefore of very great importance to our inquiry, and his three books, entitled De Occulla Philosophia, are the starting-point of Kabalistic knowledge among the Latin-reading scholars of Europe. It is needless to say that his treatise enjoyed immense repute and authority.

It would serve no purpose to repeat all the points of the instruction, because much of it has been already given, while the tables of commutations showing the extraction of angelical names would require elaborate diagrams. My object is to note rather than illustrate exhaustively the character of Agrippa s exposition, which is concerned largely with the so-called practical Kabalah, and very slightly with the more important philosophical literature. It brought him no satisfaction, and before his troubled life drew to its disastrous close he recorded his opinion that the Kabalistic art, which he had &quot; diligently and laboriously sought after,&quot; was merely a &quot; rhapsody of superstition,&quot; that its mysteries were &quot; wrested from the Holy Scriptures,&quot; a play with allegory proving nothing. As to the alleged miracles wrought by its practical operations, he supposes that there is no one so foolish as to believe it has any such powers. In a word, &quot;the Kabalah of the Jews is nothing but a pernicious superstition by which at their pleasure they gather, divide and transfer words, names and letters in Scripture ; and by making one thing out of another dissolve the connections of the truth.&quot; What was done by the Jews for the literature of the Ancient Covenant was performed, he goes on to say, for the Greek documents of Christianity by"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"348 &he 5} 0r * r i ne an ^ 3Pitct*ttM ot the the Ophites, Gnostics, and Valentinians, who produced a Greek Kabalah, as Rabanus, the monk, later on attempted with the Latin characters.

I do not think that any one at the present day can regard transpositions and extractions seriously, but the question is whether these things were not after all a subterfuge, or if not exactly a subterfuge, a corruption of an older system. Agrippa adds another argument which also, from its own standpoint, could not be better expressed : * If Kabalistic art proceed from God, as the Jews boast, and if it conduce to the perfection of life, the health of men and the worship of God, as also to the truth of understanding, surely that Spirit of Truth which has left their synagogue and has come to teach us all truth, would not have concealed it from His Church even until these last times, and this the more seeing that the Church knows all things which are of God, while His mysteries of salvation are revealed in every tongue, for every tongue has the same power, if there be the same equal piety ; neither is there any name, in heaven or on earth, by which we can be saved, whereby we can work miracles, but the one name Jesus, wherein all things are recapitulated and contained.&quot; Of course, in the last analysis this argument proves too much. There is either a peculiar virtue in Divine Names or there is not.

The name of Jesus spells grace and salvation to millions, but it spells nothing when lettered separately and nothing when it is transposed. To say otherwise is to rave. V. PARACELSUS Among the great names of occultism which are cited in support of the influence exerted by the Kabalah and the authority which it possessed, that of Paracelsus is mentioned. We are given to under stand, for example, by Isaac Myer, that it is to be traced distinctly in the system of the great German adept.* Statements like these are themselves a kind of Kabalah, which are received by one writer from another without any inquiry or any attempt at verification. In this way we obtain lists of authori ties, references and testimonials which seem at first sight to carry great weight, but they will bear no examination and defeat their own purpose when they come into the hands of a student who has sufficient patience to investigate them.

When he concerns himself with magic, he has few correspondences which will enable him to be illustrated by other writers on this subject : again, he was his own magician. And to come to the question of the Kabalah, if we discover, on examination, that he has anything to say concerning it, we should expect that it would be quite unlike anything that went before him, and quite foreign to the known lines of Kabalism. Once more, we should find that he would prove to be his own Kabalist. In every department of thought he illustrated his own maxim : Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest. It must be added also that any contributions which he offers are seldom helpful. They do nothing to elucidate what is obscure in previous authorities, and they constitute new departures which are themselves much in need of explanation. Nearly two centuries elapsed between the death of Moses de Leon, the &quot;first publisher of the Zohar, and the birth of Theophrastus of Hohenheim, and though no attempt to print it took place till some forty years after his turbulent life closed so sadly at Strasburg, or wherever it actually occurred, there * He is said, indeed, to have boasted that his library would not amount to six folio volumes.

It is very difficult to judge Paracelsus, and many false statements have been made concerning him by friends and enemies.

JOHN REUCHLIN As these sketches are not constructed biogra- phically, there will be no difficulty in regarding the subject of the present notice as the representative of a group, which group illustrates most effectively the standpoint and purpose of our inquiry as regards the Christian students of the Kabalah. The missionary enthusiasm which may be said to have begun with Mirandola, which, if Lully had been a Kabalist, would have been already at fever heat in the doctor illumi- ncitus of Majorca, which ceased only in the earl)- part of the eighteenth century, assumed almost the aspect of a movement between the period of Rcuchlin and that of Rosenroth.

Nor is it so strong in the writings of Reuchlin as in those of Archangelus de Burgo Nuovo. It is impossible to survey the vast treatises, extending in some cases to hundreds of folio pages, by which the enthusiasm is represented, and it is fortunately not necessary. We have only to establish their proper connection with Kabalism and to show that it has been so far misconceived by occultists. We are justified in regarding Eliphas Levi as to some extent the mouthpiece of modern occult thought ; it is to him more than to any one that such thought owes its impulse towards the Jewish tradition as to the absolute of philosophy and religion, &quot; the alliance of the universal reason and the Divine Word.&quot;f It was he first who told us that &quot; all truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return therein,&quot; that it has &quot; the keys of the past, the present and the future.&quot; \\ In order to receive initiation into this great tradition he has counselled us, among other books, to have recourse to the &quot;Hebrew writers in the collection of Pistorius.&quot; * Artis Cabalistica, hoc est, recondita; theologia: et philosophies Scriptorum, Tomus I., Basiliae, 1587. f Dogme, de la Haute Magic, p. 95, 2me edition, Paris, 1861 ; &quot;Transcendental Magic,&quot; p. 20; &quot;Mysteries of Magic,&quot; second edition, p. 502.

If is well also to add that they are not the work of occultists or of persons who believed that &quot; Catholic doctrine,&quot; or Lutheran, is &quot; wholly derived &quot; from the Kabalah. The writers are of three types : I. The Jew who had abjured Israel and directed his polemics against it. He is represented by Riccius, and his presence is fatal to Levi s standpoint.

He is represented by a writer who, as a fact, was born a Jew and seems to have been included by Pistorius because of his supposed conversion. I refer to Abravanel, whose &quot; Philosophy of Love &quot; is the subject of special mention by Eliphas Levi as if it were a text-book of Kabalism. The &quot; Dialogues &quot; have been already dealt with, and here it is enough to say that their citation annihilates Levi, because a student of the Kabalah might as well be referred to the &quot; Art &quot; of Ovid. As regards Pistorius himself, the only point at which he makes contact with occultism is in the fact that his enterprise was undertaken, among other reasons, as a counterblast to the superstitions which the Kabalah had promoted in Christendom ; a reference, we may presume, to the unfortunate budget of Agrippa and to the increasing grimoire literature. The Kabalistic studies of the editor began in his boyhood, but, so far from leading him to the boasted certitude of Levi, he passed under their escort into Protestantism, and there was conferred upon him the august distinction of figuring as one of the deputies charged to present the Lutheran Confession of Faith to the Diet of Augsbourg.

In place of them, as opportunity afforded, they burnt De Verbo Mirifico and De Arte Cabbalistica, the contributions of Reuchlin to the right understanding of the secret tradition in Israel. The treatises remain all the same as witnesses of the standpoint of Christian students in the sixteenth century, and they help to warrant us in affirming that the chief Latin collection of Kabalistic writers, outside the Kabbala Denudata, contains no evidence in support of the occult hypothesis. I must by no means leave this brief and con fessedly inadequate notice of Reuchlin and his connections without a word of reference to his learned pupil, J. A. Widmanstadt, whose collection of Hebrew manuscripts, for the most part Kabalistic, is one of the great treasures of the Library of Munich. In the course of his life-long studies he gave special attention to the Zohar and to the theurgic side of the Jewish tradition. VII.

The result of these errors of enthusiasm was that Postel was shut up in some convent, a course dictated possibly as much by a feeling of consideration, and even of mercy, towards a learned man unfitted for contact with the world, as by the sentiment of intolerance. The seclusion, in any case, offered him the kind of advantages that he most needed, and he died in peace, having retracted, it is said, everything that was disapproved by his superiors. As already seen, Postel connects with Kabalism by the great fact that he discovered and made known in the West that celebrated &quot;Book of Formation&quot; which contains some of its fundamental doctrine.f He also expounded its principles in a species of commentary to which I shall recur shortly.

While it is quite true that he was excessively fanciful in his notions, which are extrava gant in the philological as well as the conventional sense of that term, it is not at all true that he had set aside or exceeded the accepted doctrinal views of his period, nor does he appear to have possessed a specific light on given points of teaching which can be regarded as considerable for his period.

There is no mischief in such adoption, provided the limits of the pretension are clear, and, with the exception of one or two which have appeared in America, this has, I think, been the case.

Having given the usual legend of the tradition, its reception by Moses from God, and its oral perpetuation till the time of Esdras, he divides the Kabalah into two parts, that of Cosmology, dealing with the forces operating in created things, both sublunary and celestial, and expounding on philosophical grounds the arcana of the written law. This division, he observes, does not differ materially from the Natural Magic in which Solomon is recorded to have excelled, and he adds that the magical powers of natural things, concealed in their centre, can be brought forth by this species of Kabalah. The second division is entitled Mercavah, which contemplates things Divine, angelical powers, sacred names and signacula. It is sub-divided into Notaricon and Theomantica. Notaricon treats of the angelical virtues and names, of demoniacal natures and of human souls; Theomantica investigates the mysteries of the Divine Majesty, of sacred names and pentacles.

More, however, contributed another thesis in exposition of the Vision of Ezekiel, i.e., the Kabalistic work of the Chariot, together with a Kabalistic catechism and a refutation of the doctrine that the material world is not the product of creation ex nihilo, in which last the Platonist seems to have scarcely understood the Kabalah.

The &quot; Philosophic Cabala &quot; is established on the denary after the following fantastic manner : The Archetypal World = Monad, i. The First Matter = Duad, 2. The Habitable Order = Triad, 3. The Making of the Starry Heavens = Tetrad, 4. The Making of Fish and Fowls, or Union of the Passive and Active Principle = Pentad, 5. The Making of Beasts and Cattle, but chiefly of Man = Hexad, 6. What becomes of the rest of the denary does not appear. In his first estate Adam was wholly ethereal, and his soul was the ground which was blessed by God, whereby it brought forth every pleasant tree and every goodly growth of the heavenly Father s own planting. The Tree of Life in the garden of man s soul was the essential will of God, while the Tree of Knowledge was the will of man himself. We have here the keynote of the allegory, which is merely pleasing and altogether unsubstantial. It may, how ever, be noted that the sleep which fell upon Adam was a lassitude of Divine contemplation. The &quot; Moral Cabala &quot; recognises two principles in man, namely, spirit and flesh.

THOMAS VAUGHAN With the questionings, difficulties and tentative expositions of Henry More it will be useful to contrast what is said on the subject of Kabalism by his contemporary Eugenius Philalethcs, other wise Thomas Vaughan. It will not be forgotten by students of the byways of literature in the seventeenth century that the two writers came into collision in pamphlets. When Vaughan began his philosophical labours by the publication of two tracts on the nature of man and on the universal Spirit of Nature, More, who was after all more Platonist than mystic, and had scant tolerance for mystic terminology, published some observations concerning them, to which the Welsh mystic replied in satires with the polemical virulence of his period.

In his discourse on the antiquity of magic we find him alive, like the students who had preceded him, to the distinction between the true and the false Kabalah. The latter, described after the picturesque manner of his period, as the invention of dispersed and wandering rabbis &quot; whose brains had more of distraction than their fortunes,&quot; consists altogether &quot; in alphabetical knacks, ends always in the letter where it begins and the vanities of it are grown voluminous.&quot; But in respect of the &quot; more ancient and physical traditions of the Kabalah,&quot; Thomas Vaughan tells us that he embraces them for so many sacred truths.* He recognises also a metaphysical tradition in which the greatest mystery is the symbolism of Jacob s Ladder. &quot; Here we find two extremes Jacob is one, at the foot of the ladder, and God is the other, who stands above it, ewittens fornias et inflitxus in Jacob, sive subjectum hominew. The rounds or steps in the ladder signify the middle nature, by which Jacob is united to God.&quot;f With this symbolism he contrasts the &quot; false grammatical Kabala &quot; which &quot; consists only in rotations of the alphabet and a metathesis of letters in the text, by * &quot; Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan,&quot; edited by A.

For him the Sephiroth are ten secret principles, of which the first is a spirit in retrecesso suo fontano, while the second is the Voice of that Spirit, the third is another Spirit which proceeds from the Spirit and the Voice, and the fourth is &quot; a certain water &quot; proceeding from the third Spirit, and emanating Fire and Air. ) It will be seen that the reflections of the Welsh mystic on the apparatus of Kabalism are not elucidating, and while recording the Sephirotic attributions of the Sepher Yetzirah are not fully in consonance there with.

From the occult standpoint it is, perhaps, more interesting to ascertain the motives which led the editor of the Kabbala Denudata to the consideration of Jewish theosophy than those of any other student of the subject.

In the preface to the translation of the Zohar he expressly founds his opinion that Kabalistic dogmas may be of Divine revelation on the ground of their sanctity and sublimity, as well as their great use in explaining the books of the Old and New Testaments. He also notes that, unlike the later Jewish writings, the Zohar does not contain a single utterance against Christ. Finally, after enumerating twenty -four reasons why the Jews should enjoy toleration at Christian hands, he mentions the chief things which will assist their conversion.

RALPH CUDWORTH The honoured name of Ralph Cudworth, perhaps the greatest theosophist of his age, is still a precious memory in English theological literature of the higher type, though, except among rare students, the &quot; True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; is now unknown. It is a mine of Platonism, learning and sapience, and more than this, it is a deeply reasoned treatise of its period in opposition to the atheism of that period ; its points are established victoriously, and turning over the leaves of the colossal folio one almost regrets that the difficulties of the seventeenth century disturb us no longer and that their solution no longer helps us. It must be confessed that Cudworth connects somewhat superficially with Kabalism, and the connection, such as it is, need not detain us long. The chief thesis of the &quot; Intellectual System &quot; is that behind all the tapestries and embroideries of pagan mythology there is the doctrine of monotheism, and that civilised man in reality has never worshipped but one God, whose threefold nature was a &quot; Divine Cabbala&quot; or revelation, successively depraved and adulterated till it almost disappears for Cudworth among the &quot; particular unities&quot; of Proclus and the later Platonists.* Among * For the purposes of this notice I have used the original edition of the &quot;True Intellectual System of the Universe,&quot; London, 1668."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"gome Chri0tn gtubents of the $abalah 387 the cloud of witnesses who are convened in support of this view are included the later Rabbinical writers, the Halacoth of Maimonides, the Gnolath Tamid of Moses Albelda, the Ikkanm of Joseph Albo, the commentaries of R. David Kimchi, the book Nitsaclwn and the glosses of Rabbi Solomon, references and citings which at least serve to show that this Christian divine had attempted some curious exploration in the unknown world of Hebrew literature. His conclusion was &quot;that the Hebrew Doctors and Rabbins have been generally of this persuasion, that the Pagan Nations anciently, at least the intelligent amongst them, acknowledged One Supreme God of the whole world, and that all their other Gods were but Creatures and Inferior Ministers, which were worshipped by them upon these two accounts, either as thinking that the honour done to them redounded to the Supreme, or else that they might be their Mediators and Intercessors, Orators and Negotiators with Him, which inferior Gods of the Pagans were supposed by these Hebrews to be chiefly of two kinds, Angels and Stars or Spheres, the latter of which the Jews as well as Pagans concluded to be animated and intellectual.&quot; The question at the present day is chiefly archaic or fantastic, but it has its interest, for it serves to illustrate the strange contrast which exists between the Hebrew mind at the period of Maimonides and at that far distant epoch when the song of the Psalmist described the idols of the Gentiles as &quot; silver and gold, the work of the hands of men.&quot; In addition to the &quot;True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; Cudworth published some sermons and"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"388 ^he J)0rtrtne anii literature ot the a discourse on the &quot;True Notion of- the Lord s Supper,&quot;* afterwards translated into Latin by Mosheim, with a confutation representing the con- substantial doctrine of Lutheran theology ,f and yet again enlarged upon by Edward Felling in his &quot;Discourse on the Sacrament.&quot; The drift of the thesis is represented sufficiently by the summary of the first chapter : &quot; That it was a custom of the Jews and Heathens to feast upon things sacrificed, and that the custom of the Christians in partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ once sacrificed upon the Cross, in the Lord s Supper, is analogous thereto.&quot; It is outside my province to pronounce upon this view, but as a Christian Mystic who holds that sacrament- alism is the law of Nature and the law of Grace, it may just be remarked in passing that no theory which reduces the Eucharist to a memorial or a religious banquet can be mystically acceptable. Cudworth was by no means a mystic, and the most that his subject afforded was an opportunity to give further evidence of his unusual erudition, and it may be added of no inconsiderable skill in its manage ment. The thesis is mentioned here because it has recourse so frequently to the Rabbinical writers, to the glosses of Nachmanides, the writings of Isaac Abravanel, the Mishna, the commentary on that work by Rabbi Obadiah, the scholiasts on Judges, rare MSS. of Karaite Jews and so forth.

XIV. THOMAS BURNET With the Cambridge school of Platonists the name of Thomas Burnet, some time master of the Charterhouse, connects by association rather than the similarity of intellectual pursuits. He entered Christ s College in 1654, when Ralph Cudworth was master, while Henry More was just in his fortieth year. It was probably to the last-named divine that he owed his slight knowledge of the subject which entitles him to mention in this place. The amicable discussion between More and the editor of the Kabbala Denudata appeared, as we have seen, in that work in the year 1677, but the &quot;Interpretation of the mind of Moses&quot; had preceded it by a number of years. When Burnet published his Telluris Theoria Sacra, he gave no evidence of his interest in Platonic or Kabalistic subjects; it has been described by Brewster as a beautiful geological romance. It is, of course, concerned largely with the Mosaic scheme of creation, and the more important work which followed it, dealing as it does with the ancient doctrine concerning the origin of things, is really its extension or sequel.* In this interesting volume, written elegantly in Latin of the period, tout un grand chapitre, as the bibliography of Dr. Papus describes it, is devoted to the Kabalah.

We find, as might be anticipated, that Burnet raises no question as to the wisdom of Moses, by which he understood what all other Kabalistic students have understood also, a knowledge of natural mysteries derived from the Egyptian education of the Jewish lawgiver. He differs, however, from the Kabalists by questioning seriously how much of this wisdom came down to the Israelites. Assuming some tradition of the kind, there could be no doubt that it was depraved in the lapse of time.* In particular, the Kabalah, as we now possess it, abounds in figments of imagination and in nugatory methods. From this statement of the general position, which may be regarded as the common ground of all criticism, he proceeds to a more detailed examination, with the specific results of which no sympathetic inquirer at the present day can reasonably quarrel. The debased character of the Jewish tradition is indeed, as already seen, admitted by those who most earnestly maintain its mystical and theosophical importance.

The warning which it implies is not less needed at the present moment than in the days of Thomas Burnet. The delight in unintelligible language because it is unintelligible is as characteristic of some occult writers at the present day, even as of gloom -wrapped Hades according to the Ritual of the Dead, and it is a tendency which has an inscrutable foundation in the entire subject. It would seem indeed that the sphinx who propounds the arcana in terms as monstrous as herself needs only a commonplace to overwhelm her, as in the case of CEdipus. In accordance with his intention Burnet proceeds to divide the Kabalah into the Nominal and Real. The first is that which he has specified as worthless Gematria, Tcinurali, Notaricon, Vocabula. Its devices, he says, are the diversions of our children, and in truth it would seem hard to decide whether intellectual superiority and philosophical seriousness should be ascribed to rabbinical anagrams or to the apparatus of &quot;Tit: Tat: To.&quot; In any case, &quot; they do not belong to sane literature, much less to wisdom.&quot; So far we can accept very readily the judgment"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"39 2 ^QThe jpocitme zinfc fCitentture x&amp;gt;f the of Burnet, but destructive criticism is always com paratively easy, and there was no novelty in the line taken even so far back as the second half of the seventeenth century.

Thus, he tells us that the real Kabalah contains two things which are important for our consideration, the doctrine of the SephirotJi and that of the Four Worlds, but he complains that the conception which underlies the former does not appear clearly. With the help of the Lexicon of Rosenroth he decides finally that they are emanations from God.* He sets forth what he can glean from that source con cerning Kcther and Chokmah, and then surrenders the inquiry in the hope of finding more intelligible state ments concerning the Four Worlds.f He concludes, however, that the condemnation of all the pseudo- mystics of Kabalism, Theosophy and Hermetics is that of the unbelievers who continued to love the dark ness rather than the light when the light was come already into the world. + He assumes, as might be expected, that the &quot; Book of Occupation &quot; is the most important part of the Zohar, and glancing at the * Elsewhere, he attempts to consider their significance in connection with the axiom ex nihilo nihilfit. t He mentions in addition to the Sephiroth and the Four Worlds, the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom, from the Sepher Yetzirah and its commentary, and the Fifty Gates of Providence &quot; through which Moses attained his marvellous science, and concealed the same in the Pentateuch,&quot; i.e., according to the Kabalists. % John, iii. 19-21."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"(Dirisliau &amp;lt;Slubcnt0 of the gUbalah 393 commentaries of Isaac de Loria and of Hirtz on the tract in question and its developments, confesses his inability to understand either from text or interpreters what is meant by the symbolism of the Vast and the Lesser Countenance. &quot; We are all of us liable some time or other to be distracted by reasoning, but it is a common complaint of the mind among Orientals to be distracted by allegories.&quot; To sum the general position : We know from Maimonidcs that the Hebrews once possessed many mysteries concerning things divine, but that they have perished.* It is at the same time scarcely possible that all foundation should be wanting to the Kabalah, yet if its doctrines were openly and clearly set forth, it is hard to say whether they would move us to laughter or astonishment. Thomas Burnet has higher claims to considera tion than his ability as a critic of Kabalism. He had perhaps few qualifications from which he might be expected to understand or sympathise with the aspirations embraced by theosophy.

SAINT-MARTIN The life and doctrine of Louis Claude de Saint- Martin, the Unknown Philosopher, who at the end of the eighteenth century and amidst the torch lights of the Revolution diffused in France the higher spirit of mysticism, having been the subject of a special study,f I shall refer to him here only very briefly, for his Kabalistic connections are discussed at some length therein. He was the recipient of an esoteric tradition through Martines de Pasqually, the genesis of which remains undetermined, though it was termed Rosicrucian by his initiator, and is now termed Swedenborgian by his present interpreters in France. It is a tradition which differs very consider ably from other presentations of occult doctrine, and in particular it has little in common with what we know or may infer concerning Rosicrucian teaching.

Now, Saint- Martin was a man who cared very little, and does not scruple to say so, for purely traditional doctrines, at least as traditional, nor did he show much deference towards doctors of authority therein. He considered books at best a makeshift method of instruction, though he wrote many ; he preferred learning at first hand from God, Man and the Universe. Till he came under the influence of Jacob Bohme he neither quoted nor possessed &quot; authorities,&quot; with the exception of the Scriptures. He drew, of course, from the source of his initiation, but he never mentions it in any clear manner, except in his correspondence and his life-notes, both published posthumously. There is nothing to indicate that he had ever read Kabalistic literature ; there is every presumption that he did not. Some of his lesser doctrines possess a Kabalistic complexion. There is that in particular concerning the Great Name which I have developed at some length in the study to which I have referred, but it has lost all touch with Kabalism in the hands of Saint-Martin. So also he has a complex system of mystic numbers which suggests the Rabbinical Notaricon, but it is entirely out of line with all other numerical mysticism, as I am aware, are unknown, and I must add that personally I regard them as mythical.

Franck s work has, of course, its limitations, and it is well known to scholars that his excerpts from the Kabalistic books were early subjected to severe strictures in Germany ; but for an accomplished and luminous review of the whole subject nothing of later date can be said to have superseded it. Its analyses of the Sepher Yetzirah and of the Zohar, together with its delineations of the correspondences between the philosophical school of Kabalism and the schools of Plato, of Alexandria, of Philo, created French knowledge on the subject, and together with the researches of Munk, published some few years subsequently, have been practically the only source of that knowledge down to recent times, with the exception of such light as may be held to have been diffused by the writings of Kliphas Levi.

It did not reappear till the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in certain schools of Italy and Germany. This new mysticism, called Kabalah, from a name known already in the schools of Alexandria, but since entirely disappeared, and signifying oral tradition, issued from the bosom of the scholastic, and acted with the instruments of the scholastic, as formerly the neoplatonist Porphyry evoked with Platonic words. The Cabbala (sic) of the fifteenth century put in operation bizarre formulae, magic squares and circles, mysterious numbers, by the power of which the demons of hell and the divinities of heaven were compelled, as it was pretended, to appear in obedience to the wand ; hence the mystic ecstasies of Raymond Lully, who attracted such zealous partisans and furious enemies, causing blood to flow ; hence the delirium which brought Bruno to the stake.&quot; Victor Cousin : Cours de Philosophic, Paris, 1836.

As it is to the Lesser Coun tenance that the name of Tetragrammaton is attributed, it follows that the secret of the Zohar is the mystic utterance of the adept to the recipiendary of the Egyptian mysteries : &quot; Osiris is a black god.&quot; Microprosopus is, however, &quot; neither the Ahriman of the Persians nor the evil principle of the Manichaeans, but a more exalted concept, a mediating shadow between the infinite light and the feeble eyes of humanity ; a veil made in the likeness of humanity with which God Himself deigns to cover His glory ; * I.e.: &quot;The Mysteries of Magic,&quot; first and second edition, London, 1886, 1897."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"(Christian gtutonte ot the JUbalah 405 a shadow which contains the reason of all mysteries, explaining the terrible Deity of the prophets, who threatens and inspires fear.

The students whom we have considered heretofore have been either Christian propagandists or writers by the way whose connection with the subject is unsubstantial ; but the standpoint of Levi is that there is a feligion behind all religions and that it is the veiled mystery of Kabalism, from which all have issued and into which all return.

XVII. TWO ACADEMICAL CRITICS Having regard to the fact that, as already stated, there has been always in England a certain number of persons who have been interested, mostly through sympathy with occultism, in the study of the Kabalah, it will appear almost incredible that there are no memorials of their interest between the period of Thomas Vaughan and the year 1865, a space of two centuries. There is a similar hiatus in the merely academical interest represented by Burnet. I do not say that there have been nowhere any references to Kabalism ; they have made up in number what they wanted in learning and authority ; and a few valuable gleanings might be gathered from early editions of the larger cyclopaedias, but as there has been no occult student who wrote anything of real moment concerning it, so there has been no scholar apart from occult interests who has treated the subject seriously. The work of Dr. Ginsburgh, so well known that it scarcely needs describing, was epoch-making, because it was the first clear, simple and methodised account of Kabalistic doctrine and literature. It leaves naturally much to be desired, as it arose in an informal manner out of a meeting of some literary society in Liverpool, and the nucleus of the short paper produced for the occasion in question was afterwards expanded into a slender volume.

There is good reason to believe that it did not represent Dr. Ginsburgh s knowledge at the period, yet it went much further than cyclopaedic or theological notices. Dr. Ginsburgh is therefore entitled to a place among the Christian students of the Kabalah, and I purpose in this brief notice, which is mainly concerned with a standpoint, to connect him with the name of a writer who recalls him in France of to-day. Both, I believe, are accomplished Hebrew scholars ; both of Jewish origin. Dr. Ginsburgh is, however, a Christian, and has done work in connection with the Trini tarian Bible Society, while M. Isidore Loeb, so far as I am aware, has remained in the faith of Jewry, and it is therefore only by way of contrast with his English prototype that I am warranted in referring to him in this place. There is a period of a quarter of a century between the two writers, and as their point of view is in general respects almost identical and, indeed, suggests that the French critic has profited by the English, it is interesting to note the one matter over which they diverge, namely, the authorship of the Zohar. It has been objected against Dr. Ginsburgh that he draws chiefly from Continental writers, reflects their views and shows little independent research. His quotations from the Zohar are, it is said, derived from Franck, and are open therefore to the harsh criticisms passed on them many years ago in Germany. These matters are of no importance to the reader who is in search only of elementary information, whose"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"410 ^h* Jortrine anb ^iitt&tnu ot the gabalah purpose is served well enough by the translations of Franck and for whom a digest of authoritative criticism is about the best text-book possible. The fact itself makes Dr. Ginsburgh s little treatise the English representative of a particular school of research, that of the hostile criticisms which refer the Zohar to the authorship, more or less exclusive, of Moses de Leon. In England Dr. Schiller-Szinessy s article on the Midrashim in the ninth edition of the &quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica,&quot; referring the nucleus of the book to Mishnic times and regarding Simeon ben Jochai as the author in the same sense that R. Johanan was the author of the Palestine Talmud, has helped to create another and more natural manner of regarding the Zohar. The critical objections of Dr. Ginsburgh derived from the work itself have been equally disposed of in the majority of cases and the few which still remain can establish nothing conclusively. They have been noticed briefly in Book II., sec. 3. If we take in connection with this the fact that M. Isodore Loe b, who so closely reproduces Dr. Ginsburgh, abandons the theory of unqualified imposture, we shall see that some progress has been made with the subject during recent years, and as it is one of the purposes of the present study to place the evidence of this fact before the English reader, I feel warranted in giving space to the following synopsis of M. Isidore s Loeb s essay, as it may not be accessible to some who are acquainted with that of Dr. Ginsburgh.

Loeb towards the elucidation of Kabalistic literature occurs in La Grande Encyclopedic. M. Loeb was, however, for some time president of the publica tion committee of the French Society of Jewish Studies. His other literary work comprises a mono graph on the Jewish chroniclers, a table of Jewish calendars, and some observations on the situation of the Israelites in Turkey, Servia and Roumania. In the essay with which we are here concerned he records the opinion that the term Kabalah may not be anterior to the tenth century and that the claim to antiquity which it signifies is supported by no written monument. It seems difficult in the nature of the case that it should be so substantiated. M. Loeb, however, makes a very proper distinction between the metaphysical or mystical Kabalah and the gross thaumaturgy connected with the practical branch. To the original elements of the first he ascribes, like all critics, a high antiquity, but not, as it need scarcely be said, of a kind which would permit it to be regarded as the perpetuation of an indigenous, much less an uncor- rupted, tradition. As we have had occasion to see, this claim is no longer made by any competent student of the subject. For M. Loeb the Kabalah is a part of the universal mysticism which seeks to explain the disparity between an infinite God and a finite world by means of intermediate creations through which the Divine Power descends, diminishing in its spiritual qualities as it removes further from its source, and becoming more imperfect and material. The difficulty is removed by this process much in the same manner as the difficulty of a terra firma for the"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"4i2 ^h* Jlortrtiu an& literature of the elephant which supports the universe is disposed of in Indian cosmology by assuming the tortoise. In other words, it is not removed at all. At the same time the explanation of emanationist mysticism, which is not all mysticism, as M. Loe b seems to assume, is not in the last analysis open to greater objection than any other philosophic attempt to bridge the gulf between finite and infinite. Passing from this consideration the French critic discovers the foundation of the Kabalistic theory of meta physics in the Scriptural personification of Wisdom, and the chief elements of its symbolism in the prophetical books, about which points there is no question whatever, and they are matters of common knowledge. So also he refers correctly the name or catchword of the Zohar to Daniel xii. 3. He cites the number of the beast in the Apocalypse, as every one has cited it before him, as an example of gtmatria, but he raises a less hackneyed point by suggesting, on the authority of Munk, that Temurah was employed by Jeremiah. He does better service by reminding us that the Essenians attached great importance to symbolical angelology, and that each individual of that mystical fraternity was required to remember accurately the names of the angels. It is, however, among the Jews of Alexandria that, following several previous authorities, he discovers the germs of Kabalistic mysticism, but in this con nection he cites only the Platonic doctrine of the Logos, its influence on the Greek Septuagint and on the Chaldee version of the Old Testament.

He sketches the decline of the Palestine schools and the rise of those of Babylon, &quot;the traditional country of magic.&quot; He cites from Rab, the Babylonian, of the third century, that passage which I have mentioned elsewhere, and confesses that it is another germ of the mediaeval Kabalah, that is, the doctrine of the Sephiroth. With a rapid pen he runs over the great impetus given to Jewish literature under Arabian influence from the middle of the seventh century. He refers to the ninth century that all-important treatise entitled &quot;The Measures of the Stature of God,&quot; which is, in fact, as we have seen, the first form of the Zoharistic Macroprosopus, and is mentioned by Agobad. He places the alphabet of Akiba, dealing with the symbolism of the Hebrew letters, about the same period, together with a crowd of apocalyptic treatises, including Pirke of R. Eliezer, which has an elaborate doctrine of Pneumatology. Among all these he distinguishes the Sepher Yctzirah as occupying a place and deserving a rank apart.

When he observes further that its fountain-heads must be sought in Azariel s Com mentary on the Sephiroth and in the Bahir, I fail to understand the grounds on which he attributes a superior antiquity to those works. He assigns to the Zohar itself a Spanish origin, but does not press the authorship of Moses de Leon. Among the fine points of his criticism is a picture of the pure Talmudists of the period of Maimonides, especially those of the Peninsula and the south of France, living under the influence of Arabian philosophy, without philosophical doctrine, without perspective, having only the literature of the Law, and the anthropomorphic mysticism of the Jewish schools of Northern France, between which the Kabalah rose up as a mediator, &quot;completing Talmudism by philosophy, correcting philosophy by theosophy, and anthropomorphic mysticism by philosophic mysticism.&quot; XVIII.

There are rumours of the initiations which were offered him and of the rites which he remodelled, but all that is known certainly is that he collected around him a small group of private students who looked up to him as their master, regarded his suggestive speculations almost in the light of revelation, and, following his leading, accepted the Kabalah as the great synthesis of religious belief. It was not till another ten years, after his death, had elapsed that any visible result of his influence became manifest. During that period a marked change had come over philosophic thought in Paris ; the younger generation broke away from the traditions of positivism and materialism, and, without returning to the Church, passed off in the direction of mysticism, and mysticism moderated by science became the characteristic of the succeeding epoch. When about the year 1 884 the Theosophical Society opened a lodge in Paris and began the publication of a monthly magazine, a proportion of the French mystics gathered round it, and one of the most noticeable in the group was Dr. Gerard Encausse, the young chef de laboratoire of an eminent doctor celebrated in connection with one of the schools of hypnotism. His first contributions appeared in the pages of Le Lotus and his first work, on the elements of occult science, under the auspices of the Society. A rupture, however, took place and the seceding members, abandoning for the moment their interest in la metaphysique orientate, established, so to speak, a school of Western occultism, of which Dr. Encausse became the moving and leading spirit and Eliphas LeVi the most immediate inspiration of"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"4i 6 ^he |p citrine anb JCtterature at the the past. The ostensible characteristics of this school are Neo-Martinism and Neo-Rosicrucianism, but the transcendental conceptions associated with these names have undergone developments which have to some extent effaced their original outlines. So also the admired masterpieces of Eliphas Levi have been a point of departure quite as much as a guide. It is, broadly speaking, nevertheless, the work of Levi which has been continued, and along with other occult interests the study of the Kabalah has been revived under the reflected impulsion of his enthusiasm. It has not been so far an exhaustive study, nor has it, I think, been altogether a critical study, for it began by taking too much for granted and it has not shown a comprehensive acquaintance with the documents. There is, however, no writer of this group who has not had something to tell us concerning Jewish theosophy, while its activity has engendered consequences of much the same kind outside its immediate circle. The two names which most call for notice in this connection are Dr. Gerard Encausse and Stanislas de Guaita. The literary and occult antecedents of the first writer are Saint Yves d Alvedre, Fabre d Olivet, Eliphas Levi and Adolphe Franck. From the first he has derived a systematic view of Jewish history, from the second his notion of esoteric mysteries concealed in the Hebrew language, from LeVi unfortunately a burden of historical suppositions, and from Franck an academic precedent for the antiquity of Kabalistic literature.

PAPUS The word Papus signifies physician, and according to a commentary of Eliphas Levi on the &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; of Apollonius, it is the title of a genius belonging to the first hour of that mystic period. It is also the pseudonym adopted by Gerard Encausse, the head of the French Martinists and the leader of occult activity in Paris, presumably because he is a doctor of medicine. Papus is a voluminous writer, methodical and laborious, and he has done work which along its own lines is admirable. From the beginning of his literary life he has been occupied with Kabalistic questions, and so far back as the year 1887 he made the first French trans lation of the Sepher Yetzirah, which appeared in the theosophical review Lotus. It is not entirely a satisfactory translation and has been superseded by that of Meyer Lambert, which Papus himself recom mends with the generosity of a true student. The chief blemish of his own version is that by some misconception or error, founded apparently on the use of a dubious word in the Latin rendering of Postel, he has made this ancient work responsible for the doctrine of Ain Soph and it is a point of great critical importance that there is no such doctrine in the &quot; Book of Formation.&quot; DD"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"4i 8 ^The Ipodritu anb ffiterature of the Jiabalah In 1892 Papus published a methodical summary of the Kabalah, together with a bibliography, which are both useful, but are again open to criticism. The bibliography has been constructed upon the most debatable of all principles, viz., the increase of the numerical importance by adventitious elements which are not Kabalistic at all, and again by the inclusion of works which are evidently unknown to the writer, with results which are occasionally ludicrous. Thus, in the one case, among books in the French language, we find Figuier s &quot; Alchemy and the Alchemists,&quot; which contains no reference to the Kabalah ; Saint-Martin s &quot; Crocodile,&quot; a clumsy satire open to the same objection ; Eckartshausen s &quot; Cloud on the Sanctuary,&quot; also non- Kabalistic ; and a number of esoteric romances which have as much claim to insertion as Baudelaire s translation of Poe.* In the other case, Dr. Papus, who is only superficially acquainted with English, classifies Mr. Massey s translation of Du Prel s &quot; Philosophy of Mysticism,&quot; my own &quot; Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers,&quot; Dr. Hartmann s &quot; White and Black Magic,&quot; a catalogue of second-hand books issued by Mr. Redway, and, unfortunate above all other instances, the once celebrated &quot;Supernatural Religion.&quot; The bibliography of works in the Latin language is much better done, though it contains some useless numbers. * Another instance is Julien Lejay : La Science Occulte Appliquec a / Economic politique, in a volume of composite authorship, entitled La Science Secrete. I may observe, however, that this volume contains a paper on the Kabalah by Papus, subsequently embodied in his larger work. Outside this, the only reference to the subject is in an essay by F. C. Barlet, which refers the origin of the Kabalah to the fourth century."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"omt Christian &amp;lt;tubents of the gabalah 419 As regards the treatise itself it has the merit of extreme modesty ; it is, in fact, mainly a series of tabulated quotations from Franck, Loeb, de Guaita, Kircher and so forth, with a number of serviceable diagrams derived from similar sources. It is altogether excellent as a general introduction to the subject by an occultist and for the use of occultists. But it makes the mistake of attributing a real importance to the debased Hebrew influences found in the literature of Ceremonial Magic. Thus Dr. Papus says that ! the practical part of the Kabalah is barely indicated in a few manuscripts dispersed through our great collections. At Paris the Bibliotheque Nationale possesses one of the finest examples, of which the origin is attributed to Solomon.&quot; Having appreciated in another section the claim of the clavicles to recognition in Kabalistic literature, it is here only necessary to say that in the work under notice there is no attempt to justify their inclusion, which is explained by the sympathies of the author, who in this connection owes something to the French version of Molitor. Dr. Papus has also unfortunately a bias common to the majority of French and English occultists, and by this bias he is led irresistibly to prefer the imperfect equipment of past authority to the result of modern scholarship. In Egyptology he knows no higher name than that of Court de Gebelin ; in problems of Hebrew philology his great master is Fabre d Olivet ; and hence, on the one hand, we shall not be surprised to find that he regards P.

But it might be scarcely worth while to speak of it were it not for the consequences that it involves, at least in the case of Papus, as, for example, the descent of the esoteric tradition from Moses and its identity -with the mysteries of Egypt, points which, debatable or not, must not be determined after this unscholarly fashion. I have said sufficient to indicate that the historical argument, so far as it exists in Papus, is altogether unsatisfactory, and there is indeed no need * He is not alone among recent French writers in taking this view. M. Edouard Schure, in Les Grands Inities, Esquisse de t&amp;gt; Histoire Secrete des Religions, Paris, 1889, maintains that, &quot;owing to the education of Moses, there can be no doubt that he wrote Genesis in Egyptian hieroglyphics, having three senses, and confided their keys and oral explanations to his successors. In the time of Solomon it was rendered into Phoenician characters, and after the captivity of Babylon into Aramaic Chaldean characters by Esdras. The esoteric sense was lost more and more, and the Greek translators had a very slight acquaintance therewith.&quot; In this case it may have been the remnant of this knowledge which made the Jews so hostile to the Septuagmt. M. Schure continues: &quot;Jerome, despite his serious intention and his great mind, penetrated only to the primitive sense when he made his Latin translation. The secret sense does, however, remain buried in the Hebrew text, which plunges by its roots into the sacred tongue of the temples,&quot; and the writer affirms that it flashes forth at times for tl intuitive, that for seers it &quot;shines forth once more in the phonetic structure of the words adopted or created by Moses,&quot; and that by the study of this phoneticism, by the keys which the Kabalah furnishes, and by comparative esotericism, &quot; it is permitted us at this day t reconstruct the veritable Genesis.&quot; Pp. 180, 181."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"omt (Ehrietian tubents of the giabalah 421 to reckon with it. But his little work is useful as a summary of the content of the Kabalah, though even in this respect it might have been simplified with advantage. As regards the special motive of our own inquiry, the standpoint of Papus is that the Kabalah is the keystone of all the Western tradition of transcendentalism ; that the alchemists were Kabalists, and so also all mystic fraternities, whether Templars, Rosicrucians, Martinists, or Freemasons ; that the source of the Kabalah was Moses and that Moses drew from Egypt, whence the Kabalah is the most complete summary in existence of the Egyptian mysteries. Why those mysteries should have an absorbing claim on our respect does not appear from Papus, but the sub-surface understanding is un doubtedly that a tradition of absolute religion has been perpetuated from antiquity, and with all his dissemblings and palterings, with all the hindrance of his scepticism, that also is LeVi s standpoint.

He began his literary life as a poet, and in that character connects with the school of Baudelaire. His mystic preoccupations appear, however, in his verses, and he soon devoted himself exclusively to the occult sciences. His works entitled &quot; The Threshold of Mystery,&quot; &quot; The Serpent of Genesis &quot; and &quot; The Key of Black Magic &quot; are much admired for their &quot; magis terial form,&quot; which recalls that of his master. In occult science de Guaita was chiefly attached to the Kabalistic tradition, and he considered that in &quot; Neo - Mosaic Christianity, explained by the Holy Kabalah and Alexandrian Hermeticism (under certain reserves), the absolute truth must be sought in all knowledge.* At an early period of his occult enthusiasm Stanislas de Guaita founded a Kabalistic Order of the Rose-Cross, comprehending three grades, to which entrance could be obtained only after successful examination, and the possession of the three grades of the Martinist Order was an indispensable pre liminary condition.

De Guaita is termed an erudite orientalist by his friends, who also mention the Hebrew folios which enriched his library.* Finally, it is recorded that he believed himself more thoroughly possessed of the Kabalah than all others. Hut if we may accept the authority of Dr. Marc Haven he seems to have distinguished two species of Kabalah, the first a science which no one could teach and no one could learn, except with the most arduous toil and by years of sacrifice, for it is &quot; more rugged than Wronsky, more diffuse than Spanish Mysticism, more complex than Gnostic analysis.&quot; And after all it appears to be only a pseudo- Kabalah. The other is apparently the Kabalah as presented by William Postel, Nicholas Flamel, Khunrath, Saint-Martin and so forth. I must confess that this distinction is a puzzle. I know well enough that Saint-Martin was not a Kabalist, except in the most phantasmal sense and by a most remote derivation. I know that Flamel the alchemist, if he ever wrote anything, was concerned with the transmutation of metals and not with the mysteries of Am Soph. It is, however, the Kabalah of such Kabalists that is said to illuminate the pages of de Guaita and to have inspired his active works. Despite therefore tf his accredited erudition, the author of the &quot; Serpent of Genesis has no message to the serious student of Kabalism ; the Zohar has its difficulties, and by these he was clearly intimidated.

But in de Guaita, as in Levi, it is not the orthodox Christianity, as understood, on the one hand, by Mirandola and Postel, or, on the other, by Rosen roth, with which the Kabalah is connected, but Christianity permeated by Gnostic elements, and this is the special characteristic of all occult students who take any interest in the light cast on the religion of Jesus by the post-Christian develop ments of Jewish theosophy. Thus, the missionary enthusiasm of the early Christian schools of Kabalism, and the Messianic dream constructed by Jewry out of the wild elements of the Zohar, have been exchanged for an attempt to go back upon the path of doctrinal development and to discover in the analogies between the Kabalah and the Gnostics a practicable thoroughfare into the debated regions of esoteric religion. As disappointment waited on the mistaken ardour of the first zealots, so it is possibly in store for the revived zeal in Kabalism. * &quot; The Zohar has wedded the Gospel ; the spirit has fructified the soul ; and immortal works have been the fruits of this union.

It is unnecessary to say that it is an entirely hostile criticism. &quot; In place of the orthodox syna gogue and the true doctrine of Moses which God Himself inspired, modern Kabalists represent the paganism with which certain Jewish sectarians became imbued during the captivity of Babylon.

Hence we are compelled to recognise a close connection between Kabalistic philosophy and ancient paganism which is difficult to explain except by the inspiration of the same author, in other words, the Lying Spirit who is the enemy of mankind.&quot; The entire treatise may be regarded as the development of this paragraph, which, it must be confessed, is the view that would be taken inevitably by the Latin Church. We have seen that under the auspices of Christian Kabalists, with Picus de Mirandola as their mouthpiece, there was for one moment a sign of rapprochement between the Church and the Jewish tradition, but it was impossible in the nature of both, and the Church was saved then, as it has been occasionally saved since, as if by some happy intuition which preceded any real knowledge of the interests at stake. The general position being thus defined with perfect accuracy by Mgr. Meurin, he proceeds at a later stage to develop his impeachment by exhibiting the fundamental error of all pantheism, that, namely, which concerns the transition of the Infinite to the Finite, which wears, he tells us, for any serious thinker, the aspect of a fraudulent device. Basing his argument on the well-known verse in Wisdom : &quot; Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight,&quot; he advances that we musk seek in these the distinction between the Infinite and the Finite, for these categories do not exist in God, or rather they are &quot;elevated above themselves and lost in a superior unity.&quot; Creation out of nothing is the only rational solution of the grand problem concerning the"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Christian .Stnbents of the glnbalah 427 origin of a world which is governed by number, weight and measure, a doctrine which assumes no passage from Infinite to Finite, since it does not derive the universe from the divine substance by an emanation of any kind. &quot;It is true that ex nihilo nihil fit. But in the creation there is not only the nihilum ; there is also the Omnipotent, and it is untrue to say that with nothingness and the all-powerful, nothing can be made. Ex nihilo nihil fit a Deo would be a false axiom.&quot; In a study like the present it would be entirely out of place to discuss the points at issue between emanationists and creationists. The Kabalah is a system of emanation, and it is so far opposed to the official doctrine of orthodox religion on a question of fundamental philosophy. I think personally that the better reason is on the side of the hypothesis of emanation on the simple ground that the conception of nihilum cannot co-exist with that of an infinite God. I shall be told, of course, that I am confusing the notion of endless space with that of the Divine Nature, but as God is everywhere by the hypothesis, there is no place which is not filled by His power and His presence, and then where is the nihilum ? But the whole controversy concerns a res ardua ct diffic-lis, as Isaac de Loria would have termed it, which fortunately cannot produce a single consequence of importance to the human mind, though it is precisely to such arid speculations that official orthodoxy has always sought to attach an eternal consequence for the soul.

I think that no intelligent person can well deny the intellectual clumsiness with which the system of Sephirotic emanation is presented in works like the Greater Sacred Synod. We have, for example, such notions as the commence ment of thought in Ain Soph which proceeds the emanation of understanding, thus reversing the psychological order, as the prelate well observes, besides formulating an absurdity concerning the one Being in whom there is no beginning. It may well be that in the last analysis these things are to be understood more profoundly than is suggested by their surface meaning, but they are crude and mis leading enough in their outward sense. XIX. THE KABALAH AND ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY A discussion of the points of contact between Christianity and the mystical tradition of the Jews must not close without some reference to a scheme of mystical Christianity which obtained for a period a certain vogue in English occult circles and met with especial commendation from certain Kabalistic, students.

The text books of this movement were, firstly, a small collec tion containing the illuminations, and, secondly a formal treatise which, under the title of &quot; The Perfect Way,&quot; constituted a philosophical development and historical verification of the doctrines received by the seeress. Mr. S. L. McGregor Mathers dedicated his English translation of some of the Zoharistic books to the authors of this treatise on the ground that it was &quot; one of the most deeply occult works that has (sic) been written for centuries.&quot; The dedication also described it as an &quot; excellent and wonderful book,&quot; touching much on the doctrines of the Kabalah and laying great value upon its teachings. It was welcomed in terms of still higher apprecia tion by Baron Spedalieri, of Marseilles, the disciple of Kliphas Levi, who regarded it as &quot; in complete accord with all mystical traditions, and especially with the ^reat mother of these, the Kabalah.&quot; In connection with this appreciation the respectable French occultist observed : (a) That the Kabalistic tradition as we now possess it is far from genuine, and was much purer when it first emerged from the sanctuaries, (b) That when William Postel and his brother Hermetists predicted that the literature con taining the secret tradition of the Jews would become known and understood at &quot; the end of the era,&quot; they meant that it would be made the basis ol &quot;a new illumination,&quot; reinstating that tradition in its purity.

Since the whole tradition thus finds itself recovered or restored to its original purity, the prophecies of Postel and his fellow Hermetists are accomplished ; and I consider that from henceforth the study of the Kabalah will be but an object of curiosity and erudition, like that of Hebrew antiquities.&quot; If this be the case, the inquiry with which we have been occupied at such considerable length is only prolegomenary to the New Gospel of Inter pretation, and our concluding words should be simply to direct the student who is in search of the true meaning of esoteric tradition to the doctrines con tained in this last word of revelation. Indeed, such a course would seem at first sight the only one which could be followed. I must add, however, that the opinion expressed by Baron Sped dieri has produced no consequence, that the Kabalistic School of occultists in England has not followed the lead thus indicated, and would not endorse the opinion, though committed to a certain extent in the same direction, while the New Gospel of Interpretation has taken no permanent hold on the occult thought of the time. It is still occasionally quoted with respect by writers who represent Kabalism, and notably by Dr. Wynn Westcott, the translator of the &quot; Book of Formation,&quot; but this is the extent of its influence. I infer also that Baron Spedalieri s statement as to the adulteration of the genuine tradi tion in the Hebrew Kabalah would not be traversed seriously, but for its recovery occultists seem inclined"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Some (Christian &amp;lt;tubente of the gUbalah 43 r to look backward towards Egypt rather than to any form of supplementary revelation. I do not propose to recite here even the leading aspects of the system of esoteric Christianity developed in &quot;The Perfect Way,&quot; for the work is well kn-Avn and its substance has been made accessible in many forms, thanks to the untiring devotion of Mr. Edward Maitland. It does offer some conspicuous points of contact with the tradition of the Kabalah, especially as to the dual nature of God, or the Divine- Feminine, and &quot; the multiplicity of principles in the human system&quot;; but it would be easy to exaggerate their extent, as also, in some less conspicuous cases, their importance. The traceable references are few and superficial. We may find, for example, the Kabalistic doctrine of Ain Soph and His emanations in the statement that &quot; God unmanifest and abstract is the Primordial Mind, and the Kosmic universe is the ideation of that Mind,&quot; but it is not a far-reaching correspondence. So also the conception of Macro- prosopus reflected in Microprosopus is thinly sketched by the following passage. &quot; In * the Lord the Form less assumes a form, the Nameless a name, the Infinite the Definite, and these human.

Also at the close of Mr. Maitland s life he wrote much which must have been regretted by his friends, bringing his earlier work into discredit by exaggerated claims concerning it.

XX. THE KABALAH AND MODERN THEOSOPHY The attempt which was made in the year 1875, by the foundation of the Theosophical Society, to ex tend and perhaps to centralise the study of Oriental Occult Philosophy, has, in spite of its chequered history, succeeded to a very large extent in that object. If we remove from consideration certain claims advanced by the founders, about which it would be unbecoming to speak positively, as it would be impossible and misplaced here to attempt their full discussion, and if we regard the Society rather as it assumes to regard itself, namely, as an organisation designed to promote a neglected branch of knowledge, we have only to survey its literature during the past twenty years to see how large a field it has succeeded in covering. No occult student will be inclined to overlook this fact, and as the Theosophical Society possesses at least this aspect of importance, it will be useful to ascertain how far the expositions of eastern philosophy which we owe to it connect with the subject of our inquiry. It may be said in a general manner that the correspondences which I have already established are, of course, recognised.

Thus, she distinguishes between the ordinary, or Judaistic, and the universal, or Oriental Kabalah. If little be known of the one, there is nothing, at least nothing that is definite, known of the other. &quot; Its adepts are few ; but these heirs elect of the sages who first discovered the starry truths which shone on the great Shemaia of the Chaldaean lore have solved the absolute and are now resting from their grand labour.&quot; J That is a statement which, of course, we cannot check, and for any critical study of the Jewish Kabalah it can, * Compare the ignorant absurdity and assurance of the late W.

The claims of the Tarot as a key of Kabalistic symbolism are set aside, without prejudice to their merits, because of an insuperable difficulty.

We may conclude in a general manner that the tradition being ubiquitous by the hypothesis is thought to have assumed its forms everywhere and at all times. There was, for example, no exoteric religion which did not possess an esoteric interpretation* and there was no esoteric interpretation which did not connect that religion with all that is more especially understood here by the secret teaching. For this hypothesis the integral connection of Kabalism with other systems belonging to the far past would be evidence enough that it had its root in the secret tradition, but, without denying altogether that there may be a certain warrant for a not dissimilar view, we have found that many of the resemblances may be accounted for in a more natural and spontaneous manner. As, however, it was in the western world that Kabalism was chiefly propagated, and may be said roughly to have developed,! it is necessary to observe its connections with other channels by which the arcane knowledge is believed to have been communicated to the West.

Far too much stress has been laid upon the common basis of all the occult sciences, while those who look for their enlightenment more especially to the Kabalistic apparatus have been unduly predisposed to discern Kabalism at the root of all. We shall see that in most instances the connection was accidental, a matter of adornment, late in its introduction, or chiefly of the historical order.

Without attempting an inquiry in which we should be probably baffled, it is sufficient here to indicate that at the sources to which Kabalistic tradition is generally referred, namely, Akkadia, Chaldaea and Babylonia, this doctrine prevailed ; it was no doubt brought out of Babylon by the Jews, and they carried it with them into the dispersion of the third exile. It inspired a whole cycle of bizarre legends concerning Solomon and his marvels. More than this, it may be said to be directly connected with the Kabalistic symbolism concerning the divine powers and qualities attaching to the Hebrew alphabet The worlds were made, so to speak, by the instrument of a single letter, and four letters are the living forces which actuate them. There can be therefore no question that every Kabalist accepted, symbolically at least, the doctrine of the power of words.

It has been done in England and is being done at this day in France.* The professed Kabalistic occultists of the latter country would actually seem to ascribe a superior importance and an additional aspect of mystery to the worthless Clavicles of Solomon, by representing that they are the only written memorials of a most secret oral branch of practical Kabalism instead of the final debasement of a perfectly traceable if not rationally accountable doctrine concerning Divine Names.

It attributed certain names to the Sephiroth, and these were regarded as analogous to the divine forces and attributes associated with the Sephiroth. The Divine Name connected with Kether was that signifying the essence of the Deity, Eheieh (AHIH). That of Ckokmah is Jod, Jah, or Tetra- grammaton, commonly rendered Jehovah (JHVH), and susceptible of twelve permutations, similar to the sealing names of IHV in the Sepher Yetzirah. These permutations are called Banners by the Kabalists. The name Jehovah Elohim (JHVH ALHIM) is attributed to Bin&amp;lt;ih and signifies God of Gods.

II. THE KABALAH AND ALCHEMY Some reference has been made to the subject of Hermetic tradition when considering the Kabalistic treatise entitled &quot;Purifying Fire.&quot; We have there seen that the Hermetic and Kabalistic philosophies are generally ascribed to a common source, and this is the case with sympathetic as well as hostile critics. The question, however, is exceedingly complicated, and though I should have much hesitation in differing from such a consensus of authorities,* I am not less sure that as regards the branch of Hermetic philosophy which is known under the name of alchemy, we should be exceedingly careful about making and accepting statements. We must begin first of all by distinguishing the earlier books ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus, and not concerned with the transmutation of metals,f * In a pamphlet entitled &quot; The Science of Alchymy,&quot; by &quot; Supere Aude,&quot; Fra. K.R. et A.C., the &quot;sages of medieval Europe are said&quot; to have derived their knowledge of this subject, (i) from the Arabs, (2) from the heirs of the traditional lore now identified by the name &quot; Kabalah,&quot; (3) from ancient Egypt. Of these alleged sources, the first only is historically certain. t Compare, however, the anonymous preface to the first English translation of the Divine Poimander, that of Dr. John Everard, 1650; FF"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"450 Ihe itortrine an& literature ot the from such late compositions, to make use of no stronger term, as the Emerald Table and the Golden Treatise.

We may search the Greek alchemists in vain for any definite doctrinal connection with these works, though Hermes is naturally included among the great names of antiquity who are associated with the making of gold, and there are also other references to this mystical personage. While we must discount altogether such extreme opinions as that of Isaac Casaubon, who represents the earlier Hermetic treatises as the work of a Kabalistic adept who was probably a Jew of Alexandria,^ we have numerous general reasons for admitting that there were points of contact between Neo-Platonism here the possession of &quot;the great Elixir of the Philosophers&quot; is ascribed to Hermes Termaximus.

It is known that the Jews exercised an influence of the first importance in this fusion of the religious and scientific doctrines of the East and of Greece, which presided at the birth of Christianity.

There was never much excuse for this opinion, and it is only necessary to add that since the researches of Berthelot it has become impossible.

So also the reference to the Labyrinth of Solomon which occurs among the remains of still earlier Greek alchemists is a mediaeval inter- polation.f In short, the celebrated Byzantine collection, which is so far the source of all alchemy, shows no traces of acquaintance with the Jewish secret tradition.

From a priori considerations we shall be disposed to believe that the case of astrology will prove some thing like that of alchemy, namely, that its history and literature contain little to connect it essentially with Jewry. It has the air of an exact science and seems to suggest few possible analogies with the speculations of a theosophical system. There are two facts, however, which it must be admitted are above challenge, firstly, that the Jews were much addicted to astrology,* and, secondly, that the prophetic science of the stars, as it is known in the West, has derived something from the later Hebrews. Against these must be placed two other facts, not of less significance, namely, that ancient Israel contributed very little to the science of astronomy, that Jewish astronomical writings belonging to the Christian centuries draw chiefly from Arabia, and that as regards astrology in Jewry, during the Kabalistic period, it was imbedded in fastastic notions and puerile processes.

THE KABALAH AND FREEMASONRY It is generally agreed among occultists that the Masonic Fraternity is an institution of mystic origin, but that it has lost its real secrets and is interesting only as a survival. As such, it continues to preserve certain legends arid symbols of occult philosophy, but it applies to them a conventional meaning of an obvious and meagre character. As to its historical origin, there is also a general opinion prevailing in the same circles, namely, that Freemasonry, after some manner that is not wholly apparent, is a survival of the ancient mysteries, but this term is used in a catholic sense, not as signifying the initiations of Egypt, of Greece, or of Rome, but rather the secret power and intelligence which is thought to have been present behind the philosophical associations of all ages and most civilised countries. During the Christian period the knowledge which would otherwise have perished was preserved among successive occult fraternities, some known to history, such as Templars and Rosicrucians, the rest working in complete silence. Corporately or otherwise, they were all affiliated with each other and symbolic Freemasonry forms the last link in the Western chain of transmission."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"(Channels of (Esoteric ^rabition 47 l No presentation of this hypothesis has so far been able to survive analysis, and the inductive student must be content to recognise, (a) the mystic nature of most Masonic symbolism to which the fraternity now attaches only elementary meanings belonging to the ethical primer ; () a certain analogy of ostensible purpose as regards the ends of human existence, but it is not worth while to insist strongly on this point ; (c) the affinity for Mysticism which has always been shown by Masonry during its historical period. It may be added that there are certain indications which point to a possible connection between Masonry and Rosicrucianism, and this, if admitted, would constitute the first link in its con nection with the past. The evidence is, however, inconclusive, or at least unextricated. Freemasonry per se, in spite of the affinity with Mysticism which I have just mentioned, has never exhibited any mystic character, nor has it a clear notion how it came by its symbols; though occultists at all times bave gravitated towards it, and though it has tolerated and even received them, it has shown no sense of under standing on occult subjects.

During the prevalence of the passion for rites we know that alchemists, Swedenborgians,* Martinists, theurgists, astrologers, all invented new grades and new orders, and as at this period there were also Kabalists, so in one or two instances we hear of Kabalistic rites, and especially of rites and grades which exhibit Kabalistic influences. As Free masonry is not Swedenborgianism, as it is not alchemy, as in spite of the Elect Cohens, the evocations and rituals of Pasqually, and all the magical marvels of Schrcepfer, it is not theurgy, as it is still less the mysticism of any of the true Mystics, so it is not Kabalism, but it has been developed somewhat in Kabalistic as in other interests. It must be added that the few Kabalistic degrees which have left any record behind them beyond their name, and the uncommon swiftness with which they passed into extinction, give no evidence of acquaintance with the Jewish esoteric tradition. They represent the Kabalism of the period.

There may be many of its own brethren at the present time in whom this statement will excite only incredulity, * Among the degrees collected by the French Mason Peuvret, there was that of Mafon Cabbalistique.

The evidence of all these things is to be found in the vast body of instruction which he compiled, chiefly from sources in occult literature, for all the grades of the order.

V. THE KABALAH AND THE TAROT It is very well known to all occult students at the present day that the Tarot is a method of divination* by means of seventy-eight symbolical picture - cards, to which great antiquity and high importance are attributed by several authorities. Their literary history is also equally well known. They were first mentioned by the French archaeologist Court de Gebelin at the close of the eighteenth century, and were attributed by him to an Egyptian origin. Much about the same time the subject was taken up by a professed cartomancer, named Alliette, who wrote a great deal about them in several illiterate tracts, and endeavoured to trace their connection with Egypt through the Jewish Kabalah. The inquiry then fell into neglect, except in so far as Continental fortune-tellers were concerned, until the year 1854, when Eliphas LeVi made his first contributions to occult science. * As there may, however, be some readers who are not acquainted with this matter, I may observe that Mr. S. L. MacGregor Mathers is the author of a small explanatory treatise, entitled, &quot;The Tarot; its Occult Signification,&quot; &c., published with a set of the cards, London, 1888."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"480 i;he gortritu anb JDitmture of the Jhtbalah In 1857, J. A. Vaillant* endeavoured to prove their Chinese origin^ and transmission by means of the gipsies ; their connection with these nomads was subsequently adopted by LeVi, who gave great prominence to the Tarot in all his writings up to the year 1865. The subject was also taken in hand by P. Christian, who published a large history of Magic in 1870. He developed still further the Egyptian theory, but no statement which he makes can be accepted with any confidence. In the year 1887 I was the first who introduced the claims of the Tarot to English readers in a digest of the chief works of Eliphas Levi. An important contribution to the inquiry was made shortly after by the French occultist Papus, whose elaborate work entitled the &quot; Tarot of the Bohemians,&quot; though scarcely of critical value on the historical side, remains the most comprehensive and attractive summary of all the arguments. The point which concerns us here is, of course, the Kabalistic connections. Eliphas LeVi says that * Histoire Vraie des Vrais Bohhniens. As a notice of the gipsies this work is exceedingly good for its period ; its Tarot speculations are worthless, and its philological arguments absurd. M. Vaillant described the Tarot as &quot; the synthesis of ancient faith, a deduction from the sidereal book of Enoch &quot; (412). Its origin he affirms to be lost in the night of time (413). He only mentions the Kabalah to establish its connection with Cabul !

It must be admitted, on the other hand, that the analogies are exceedingly striking, and that although the historic evidences can scarcely be said to exist, and have been supplied from the treasures of imagination, there can be no doubt that the Tarot is actually, as it is claimed to be, of considerable importance symbolically. I may perhaps be per mitted also to register my personal belief that it has distinct Kabalistic connections, some of which were broadly outlined by Eliphas LeVi. Unfortunately, the interpretations of its symbolism which have been attempted by various writers are nearly worth less, in the first place because they have all proved themselves incapable of conducting a dispassionate historical inquiry ; they have allowed affirmation to take the place of evidence ; they have regarded a hint as a sufficient ground of conviction ; they have made conjecture certitude.

In the second place, the symbolism of the Tarot, which, to do justice to Dr. Papus, is most patiently and skilfully elaborated in his work, is at once disorganised if there be any doubt as to the attribu tion of its trump cards to the Hebrew alphabet. Now there is one card which bears no number and is therefore allocated according to the discretion of the interpreter. It has been allocated in all cases wrongly, by the uninstructed because they had nothing but their private judgment to guide them, and by those who knew better because they desired to mislead.

The symbolism is, however, so rich that it will give meanings of a kind in whatever way it may be disposed, and some of these may be strikingly suggestive, but they are illusory none the less. The purpose of this short paper is therefore to show that the published Tarots and the methods of using them may be very service able for divination, fortune- telling and other trifles, but they are not the key of the Kabalah, and that the Royal Game of Goose may be recommended with almost as much reason for the same purpose. Dr. Papus is therefore unconsciously misdirecting his many followers when he advertises his laborious readings as the &quot;Absolute Key to Occult Science.&quot; VI. THE KABALAH AND MYSTICISM It is a task of no inconsiderable difficulty to attempt a judgment upon the Kabalah from the purely mystic standpoint. On the one hand the history of Kabalism is so imbedded in that of mysticism, that it is scarcely known or admitted in any distinct connection. On the other hand, to the pure mystic, there is so much in the Kabalistic system which seems extrinsic to the subject of mysticism, that there is a temptation to underrate its real influence.

For that far larger class to whom the possibility of sanctity is denied, who are in search rather of a guide for thought upon questions of fundamental philosophy, I conceive that the Kabalah but again, like other metaphysics has some useful and reassuring lights. It is a source of intellectual consolation that one of the most barren of all the ways pursued by the human mind has its own strange flowers and fruit. There is no book, and there is no system, to which this moderate office can be denied.

Now, the speech of the human soul, in what state soever, must be a message to the mystic. There is no need to add that on the philosophical side the Kabalah connects assuredly with mysticism.* With occultism, of course, it connects wholly, throughout all its history. The difference between occultism and mysticism is much more than that of a Latin equivalent for a Greek term, as might appear at first sight. We are all acquainted with the distinction which is made between the magnetic and hypnotic sleep. They have much in common, but they are pathologically separate, having diverse characteristics and a divergent mode of induction. Sleep, however, is obtained in both, and this is their * M.

Between occult science and mystic science there is the common point of union which is created, let us say, by their secrecy. Beneath this fantastic resemblance there is the more important fact that they both profess to deal with the inner and otherwise uninvestigated forces of the human soul. In the case of occult science it is, however, for the kind of end which we connect with the notions of magic. For example, Talismanic Magic, so called, is ostensibly the art of infusing a certain recondite spiritual power into some object composed artificially. This is an operation of occult science because it deals with a power which is, by the hypothesis, of an occult or generally unknown nature and applies it in accordance with the formulae of a concealed instruction. A knowledge of the powers which are latent in human nature is not unlikely to lead to mysticism, which is the develop ment of the latent powers in the direction of divine union. There is usually, however, no person less really mystic than the occultist conventionally under stood. The points of contact between occult science and the Kabalah are very numerous, but between Mysticism and the Kabalah they are, com paratively speaking, few.

This is true in a degree even of astrology, though it must be said frankly that its rabbinical aspects are often highly fantastic, confined by their ignorance to the most general conclusions and based upon absurd principles, as appears most explicitly, though not with intention, in the defence of Gaffarel. Ceremonial Magic in the West had, as we have seen, its root in Kabalism ; so had all methodised Divination, while the connections of alchemy with the ALsh Metzareph have been the subject of a special study. It seems unnecessary to prolong the thesis of the present section. The end of Mysticism is the recovery or attainment of conscious ness in God. The secret doctrine of the creation, as that of the emanation of souls, written symbolically, cannot in the absence of the Key which will open its mysteries, be of any use to the mystic, nor can the Key itself, which is the successful methodising of the confused Kabalistic medley, provide more than intellectual knowledge, even by the most extreme hypo thesis. Should he enter within the circle of initiation where that Key is said to be obtained the student will in due time be in a position to know whether the secret knowledge which underlies such symbolism can contribute to the success of his enterprise. But it is not impossible that a knowledge so obtained will take him far from any traditions of Israel.

Finally, the greatest students of occult science within my acquaintance have been invariably taken further afield. It must be confessed, however, that the question is complicated by a number of issues to which it is impossible to do justice in a brief space. But it may be clearly set down that as mysticism, properly disengaged from its adventitious associations and regarded essentially, is a sacramental experience of the soul, not a system of cosmology, not a doctrine of spiritual essences con structed hypothetically, so it has at best but an extrinsic connection with Bereshith and Mercavah^ as, in like manner, with all that we understand conventionally by the occult sciences. We have now reached the term of our inquiry, and a small space only can be spared to a summary of its results.

We reject entirely the German school of Dr. Graetz, whose popular English exponent is Dr. Ginsburgh. We regard the Zoharic writings as the growth of some centuries.

We consider that the period of R. Akiba is not an unwarrantable date to ascribe to the Sepher Yetzirah, or to some earlier form of that document, but the extent to which it antedated the ninth century must remain conjectural. We observe in the Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar certain doctrines which in some form or other belong to all occultism ; they are part of its burden, but they go far back into antiquity. We believe these doctrines to have been derived by the Jew in his early settlements and captivities. We regard the other doctrines of the Zohar, in so far as they follow from Scripture, to be of various and chiefly unassignable dates and periods, but in so far as they are philosophical subtleties or theosophical fantasies we regard them as largely post-Talmudic. We look upon the Kabalistic writings as documents of humanity, and among such as memorials of the genius of Israel, possessing their connections with other systems and other modes of thought, but by correspondence, by affiliation, by filtration, by causal identity, rather than by historic descent.

It contains few or no traces of that doctrine of secret religion which occultists look for therein. It is the theosophical doctrine of Jewry. It supposes and involves the whole claim of Jewry, and as such its acceptation in any serious teaching sense is intolerable to the modern mind and would not be worth arguing were it not for the strong trend of occult thought in its direction. The existence of a concealed doctrine of religion perpetuated from antiquity cannot be proved by recourse to Kabalistic literature, and in so far as this notion has been rested thereon, it is to that extent discounted, yet the question itself does not stand or fall by the Kabalah. Speaking from the transcendental standpoint for the first time, as I feel warranted to do in concluding, I venture to say that it is in Christian channels that this doctrine must be sought by those who assume it, by which I mean that the transcendental succession has passed into the Church of Christ. The question, however, is not approachable from the historical side, and in no real sense of the term can it be said to possess such a side.
