[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Sefer ha-Zohar The Book of Splendour What is The Sefer ha-Zohar? The Zohar [radiance] is the greatest classic of Jew ish mysticism. It is a mystical commentary on the Torah, written in Aramaic, and is purported to be t he teachings of the 2nd century Palestinian Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai. Legend relates that during a time of Roman persecution, Rabbi Shimon hid in a cave for 13 years, studying Torah with his son; During t his time he is said to have been inspired by G@d to write the Zohar. However, there is no real mention of this book in any Jewish literature until the 13t h century. In the 13th century, a Spanish Kabbalist by the nam e of Moses De Leon [1240-1305] claimed to discover the text of the Zohar, and the text was su bsequently published and distributed throughout the Jewish world. However de Leon denied authorship his entire life. However, there is a school of thought (based on the writings of historian Gershom Scholem) that de Leon himself was the most likely author of the Zoha r. Among other things, Scholem noticed the Zohar's frequent errors in Aramaic grammar and its highly s uspicious traces of Spanish words and sentence patterns. This is still highly disputed by most (bu t not all) Orthodox Jews. Whoever the author is, the content of the book is n ot fraudulent. It definitely is based on older work s, and it was a common practice to ascribe the authors hip of a document to an ancient rabbi in order to g ive the document more weight. The Zohar contains and elaborates upon much of the material found in 'Sefer Yetzirah' and 'Sefer Bahir ', and without question is the Kabbalistic work par ex cellance. Among the issues discussed at length are the divine creation process [through a series of te n spheres] and the problem of evil. It stresses the cosmic significance of human deeds.

[Genesis 1:3] This is the light that the Blessed Holy One created at first. It is the light of the eye. It is the li ght that the Blessed Holy One showed the first Adam; with it he saw from one end of the world to the other. It is t he light that the Blessed Holy One showed David; he sa ng its praise: \"How great is Your good that You have concealed for those who fear You!\" [Psalms 31:20] It is the light that the Blessed Holy One showed Mo ses; with it h e saw from Gilead to Dan. But when the Blessed Holy One saw that three wicked generations would arise: the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Tower of Babel, He hid the light away so they would not make use of it. The Blessed Holy One gave it to Moses and he used it for the three unused months o f his gestation, as it is said: \"She concealed him fo r three months\" [Exodus 2:2] When three months had passed, he was brought before Pharaoh and the Blessed Holy One took it away from him until he stood on Mt. Sinai to receive the Torah. Then He gave him back that light; he wielde d it his whole life long and the children of Israel c ould not come near him until he put a veil over his face, as it is said: \"They were afraid to come near him\" [Exodus 34:30] He wrapped himself in it as in a tallit, as it is w ritten: \"He wraps Himself in light as in a garment\" [Psalms 104:2] \"'Let there be light!' And there was light.\" Every subject of the phrase \"And there was exists in this world and in the world that is coming. Rabbi Isaac said, \"The light created by the Blessed Holy One in the act of Creation flared from one en d of the world to the other and was hidden away. Why was it hidden away? So the wicked of the world would not enjoy it and the worlds would not enjoy it because of them. It is stored away for the righteous, for the Righteous One! As it is written: 'Light is sown for the righteous one, joy for the upright in heart' [Psalms 97:11] Then the worlds will be fragrant, and all will be o ne. But until the day when the world that is coming arrives, it is stored and hidden away....\" Rabbi Judah said \"If it were completely hidden the world would not exist for even a moment! Rather, it is hidden and sown like a seed that gives birth to seeds and fruit. Thereby the world is sustained. Ev ery single day, a ray of that light shines into the wor ld and keeps everything alive, for with that ray th e Blessed Holy One feeds the world. And everywhere th at Torah is studied at night one thread-thin ray appears from that hidden light and flows down upon those absorbed in her, as it is written: 'By day YHVH will enjoin His love; in the night His song is with me\" [Psalms 42:9] as we have already established...

He blessed them and called their name Adam on the day they were cre ated. [Genesis 5:1-2] Rabbi Shim'on said \"High mysteries are revealed in these two verses. 'Male and female He created them' to make known the Glory on high, the mystery of fai th. Out of this mystery, Adam was created. Come and see: With the mystery by which heaven and earth were created Adam was created. Of them it is written: 'These are the generations of heaven an d earth' [Genesis 2:4] Of Adam it is written: 'This is the book of the generations of Adam.' Of them it is written: 'when they were created.' Of Adam it is written: 'on the day they were created.' 'Male and female He created them.' From here we lea rn: Any image that does not embrace male and female is not a high and true image. We have establ ished this in the mystery of our Mishnah. Come and see: The Blessed Holy One does not place His abode in any place where male and female are not found together. Blessings are found only in places where male and female are found, as it is written: 'He blessed them and called their name Adam on the day they were created\" It is not written: He blessed hi m and called his name Adam\" A human being is only cal led Adam when male and female are as one.\" Index After The Flood Rabi opened \"'YHVH smelled the pleasing aroma and s aid \"Never again will I doom the world because of human kind\" ' [Genesis 8:21] When Noah came out of the ark he opened his eyes an d saw the whole world completely destroyed. He began crying for the world and said 'Master of the world!

' He offered up offerings and began to pray before Him and the aroma ascended before the Blessed Holy One and was sweet.\" Rabi continued \"A triple aroma ascended to God: the aroma of Noah's offering, the aroma of his prayer, and the aroma of his actions. No aroma in the whole world was as pleasing to Him. Therefore He commanded: 'Be observant and present to Me in due s eason My pleasing aroma' [Numbers 28:2] This means: 'Be observant: Present to me the aroma that Noah presented to Me: the aroma of offering prayer and right action. ' \" Our Rabbis have taught: How did the Blessed Holy On e respond when Noah came out of the ark and saw the whole world destroyed and began to cry over the holocaust!

Noah did not shield his generation and did not pray for them like Abraham. For as soon as the Blessed Holy One said to Abraham 'The outcry of Sodom and G omorrah is so great,' immediately, 'Abraham came forward and said \"Will You sweep away the inno cent along with the guilty\" ' [Genesis 18:20, 23] He countered the Blessed Holy One with more and mor e words until finally he implored Him to forgive the entire generation if just ten innocent people c ould be found. Abraham thought there were ten in th e city, counting Lot and his wife and his sons and da ughters; that is why he entreated no more. Moses also shielded his entire generation. As soon as the Blessed Holy One said 'Israel has sinned, \"quickly they have turned from the way,\"' what is w ritten' 'Moses implored' [Exodus 32:8, 11] What does 'implored' mean' It means that he prayed Until he was overtaken by trembling.\" Our Rabbis have said: \"Moses did not leave the Bles sed Holy One until he pledged his life for them bot h in this world and the world that is coming, as it i s written: 'And now if You would only forgive their sin!

Index Abram, The Soul-Breath YHVH said to Abram \"Go forth from your land, your place of birth, your father 's house to the la nd that I will show you. I will make you a great natio n, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you; he who curses you I will curse; all the families of the earth will bless themselves by you.\" Abram went forth as YHVH had directed him and Lot w ent with him. [Genesis 12:1-4] Rabbi Jacob son of Idi said \"All soul-breaths of th e righteous have been carved from the bedrock of th e Throne of Glory to guide the body like a father gui ding his son. For without the soul-breath, the body could not conduct itself, would not be aware of the Will, could not actualize the Will of its Creator. As Rabbi Abbahu has said: 'The soul-breath directs and trains the human being and initiates him into ever y straight path.' When the Blessed Holy One sends her from the place of holiness He blesses her with seven blessings, as it is written: 'YHVH said to Avram,' this is the so ul-breath who is av, 'a father,' to teach the body and ram, 'high' above him for she has come from a high and lofty place. What does He say to her? '\"Go forth from your land, your place of birth,\" yo ur dwelling, your place of bliss.'\" \"And from your father's house\" Rabbi Jacob said, \"T his is the mirror that shines. 'To the land that I will show you' means to such and such a body, a holy bod y, an upright body. And even so, 'I will bless thos e who bless you,' those who treat you correctly and v irtuously, those who bless Me for you, saying 'As long as the soul breathes within me I acclaim in Yo ur presence: YHVH is my God.' 'He who curses you I will curse,' those who curse y ou by acting perversely. 'Abram went forth as YHVH had directed him.' Blesse d with these seven blessings, Abram, the soul- breath, went forth, father to the body and high fro m the place of the highest. 'As YHVH had directed him' to enter the body that she had been commanded to guide and train.\" Rabbi Jacob continued \"Look what is written about h er once she has entered the body: 'And Lot went"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"with him.' This is the Devisor of Evil, destined to enter along with the soul-breath once a human is b orn. How do we know that the Devisor of Evil is called b y this name? It is said: 'The devisings of the huma n mind are evil from youth' [Genesis 8:21] This is Lot, who was cursed. This corresponds to w hat Rabbi Isaac has said: 'The serpent who seduced Eve was th e Devisor of Evil.' We know that he was cursed, as it is said: 'Cursed are you above all animals' [Genesis 3:14] Therefore, he is called Lot, Cursed. When the Soul-breath enters the body, immediately, 'Lot went with him.' For he is destined to enter with hi m, to mislead him and challenge the soul-breath.\" Index Abram's Descent Into Egypt And Abram went down to Egypt. [Genesis 12:10] Rabbi Shim'on said \"Come and see: Everything has se cret wisdom. This verse hints at wisdom and the levels down below, to the depths of which Abraham d escended. He knew them but did not become attached. He returned to face his Lord, was not sed uced by them like Adam, was not seduced by them like Noah. When Adam reached that level, he was seduced by the serpent and dragged Death into the world. When Noah descended to that level, what is written' 'He drank of the wine and became drunk and uncovered himself within his tent' [Genesis 9:21] The spelling implies 'her tent.' But what is written of Abraham' 'Abram went up from Egypt' [Genesis 13:1] He went up and did not come down. He returned to his domain, the high rung he had grasped before. This story appears in the Torah to reveal wisdom. A braham fulfilled himself, was not seduced, rose to his full stature, returned to his domain: 'into the Negev' [Genesis 13:1] the South, the high sphere he was linked to before. Before, it was written: 'Abram jo urneyed by stages toward the Negev' [Genesis 12:9] Now, 'into the Negev, the domain he adhered to befo re. Come and see the secret of the word: If Abram had n ot gone down into Egypt and been refined there first, he could not have partaken of the Blessed Ho ly One. Similarly with his children, when the Bless ed Holy One wanted to make them unique, a perfect peop le, and to draw them near to Him: If they had not gone down to Egypt and been refined there first, th ey would not have become His special ones. So too the Holy Land: If she had not been given fir st to Canaan to control, she would not have become the portion, the share of the Blessed Holy One. It is all one mystery.\" Index Openings He [Abraham] was sitting in the opening of the tent Sarah heard from the opening of the tent. [Genesis 18:1, 10] Rabbi Judah opened \"'Her husband is known in the ga tes when he sits among the elders of the land' [Proverbs 31:23] Come and see: The Blessed Holy One has ascended in glory. He is hidden, concealed, far beyond. There is no one in the world, nor has there ever been, wh o can understand His wisdom or withstand Him. He is hidden, concealed, transcendent, beyond, beyond. The beings up above and the creatures down below-- none of them can comprehend. All they can say is: 'Blessed be the Presence of YHVH in His place' [Ezekiel 3:12] The ones below proclaim that He is above: 'His Presence is above the heavens [Psalms 113:4] the ones above proclaim that He is below: 'Your Presence is over all the earth' [Psalms 57:12] Finally all of them, above and below, declare: 'Blessed be the Presence of YHVH wherever He is!' F or He is unknowable. No one has ever been able to identify Him. How, then, can you say: 'Her husband is known in the gates'! Her husband is the Blessed Holy One! Indeed, He is known in the gates. He is known and g rasped to the degree that one opens the gates of imagination! The capacity to connect with the spiri t of wisdom, to imagine in one's heart-mind-- this is how God becomes known. Therefore'Her husband is known in the gates,' throu gh the gates of imagination.

Who are these gates' The ones addressed in th e Psalm: 'O gates, lift up your heads! Be lifted up, openings of eternity, so the King of Glory may come !' [Psalms 24:7] Through these gates, these spheres on high, the Bl essed Holy One becomes known. Were it not so, no one could commune with Him. Come and see: Neshamah of a human being is unknowab le except through limbs of the body, subordinates of neshamah who carry out what she des igns. Thus she is known and unknown. The Blessed Holy One too is known and unknown. For He is Neshamah of neshamah, Pneuma of pneuma, completely hidden away; but through these g ates, openings for neshamah, the Blessed Holy One becomes known. Come and see: There is opening w ithin opening, level beyond level. Through these the Glory of God becomes known. 'The opening of the tent' is the opening of Righteo usness, as the Psalmist says: 'Open for me the gate s of righteousness ...' [Psalms 118:19] This is the first opening to enter. Through this o pening, all other high openings come into view. One who attains the clarit y of this opening discovers all the other openings, for all of them abide here. Now that Israel is in exile, this opening is unknow n; all the openings have abandoned Her. It is impossible to know, impossible to grasp. But when I srael comes forth from exile, all the soaring spher es will touch down upon this opening, one by one. Then human beings will perceive wondrous, precious wisdom never known by them before, as it is written : 'The spirit of YHVH shall alight upon him: a spir it of wisdom and insight, a spirit of design and power , a spirit of knowledge and awe of YHVH' [Isaiah 11:2] All these are destined to alight upon the opening below, the Opening of the Tent. All these are destined to alight upon King Messiah so that he may judge the world, as it is written: 'He shall judge the poor with righteousness...' [Isaiah 11:4] Therefore when Abraham received the good news, this sphere delivered it, as has been said, for it is written: 'Then one said, \"I will return to you when life is due\"' [Genesis 18:10] 'One said' Who it was is not spelled out. It was the Opening of the Tent! Now the same verse says: 'Sarah heard.' She heard t his sphere speaking with her husband; someone she had never heard before. And so it is written: 'Sara h heard the Opening of the Tent' who was delivering the good news: 'I will return to you when life is d ue and your wife Sarah will have a son.' \" Index An Offering To God Rabbi Shim'on opened and said \"Anyone who rejoices on the festivals and does not give the Blessed Holy One His portion, that stingy one with the evil eye, Satan, Archenemy, appears and accuses him, removes him from the world. Oh, how much trouble an d suffering he brings upon him! What is the portion of the Blessed Holy One? To gladden the poo r as best as one can. For on these days the Blessed Holy One comes to observe His broken vessels. He en ters from above and if He sees that they have nothing to celebrate He cries over them. Then he as cends to destroy the world! The members of the Academy of Heaven appear before Him and declare: 'M aster of the world! You are called Compassionate and Gracious. May Your Compassion be aroused for Your children!' He answers them: 'Does not everyone know that I bas ed the world solely on love? \"I have said, 'The world is built by love' \" [Psalms 89:3] It is love that sustains the world!' The angels on high then declare: 'Master of the wor ld! Look at so-and-so who is eating and drinking hi s fill. He could share something with the poor but he gives them nothing at all!' Then the Accuser steps forward, claims authority and sets out in pursuit o f that human being. Who in the world was greater than Abraham' He was k indhearted to all creatures. One day he prepared a feast, as it is written: 'The child grew up and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned' [Genesis 21:8] To this feast Abraham invited all the great people of his time. Now we have learned that the Accuser comes to every joyous meal to see if the host has already provided for the poor or invited the poor into his home. If so, the Accuser departs and does not enter . If not, he enters and witnesses this chaos of joy with out poor, without gifts for the poor. Then he rises above and accuses the host. When Abraham welcomed all those great people the Ac cuser descended and stood at the door disguised as a poor man. But no one noticed him. Abraham was serving the kings and celebrities. Sarah was"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"nursing all their children, because no one believed that she had given birth; they said, 'It is a foun dling from off the street!' So Sarah took their children who had come along and nursed them in front of everyone, as it is written: 'Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle children'' [Genesis 21:7] 'Children,' in the plural! Meanwhile, the Accuser was still at the door. Sarah said, 'God has made me a laughingstock. At once, the Accuser rose to face the Blessed Holy One. He s aid, 'Master of the world! You call Abraham \"My friend\"' [Isaiah 41:8] He held a feast and gave nothing to me and nothing to the poor; not even a single dove did he present to You! Furthermore, Sarah says that You made fun of her!' The Blessed Holy One responded 'Who in the world is like Abraham?' But he held his ground until he ruined the whole ce lebration and the Blessed Holy One commanded that Isaac be brought as an offering and it was decreed that Sarah would die in anguish over her son's orde al. All that suffering he brought about because he gave nothing to the poor!\" Index The Binding Of Abraham And Isaac And it came to pass after these devarim that Elohim tested Abraham. He said to him, 'Abraham.'\" and he answered, \"Here I am. \" He said, \"Take your son, yo ur favored one, whom you love, Isaac and go to the land of Moriah and offer him up as an offering...\" [Genesis 22:1-2] Rabbi Shim'on said \"We have learned that the expres sion 'And it came to pass in the days of' denotes sorrow, while the expression 'And it came to pass' even without 'in the days of' is still tinged with sorrow. 'And it came to pass after, after the lowest of all the higher spheres. Which is that' Devarim. As Mos es said: 'I am not a man of devarim' [Exodus 4:10] And who came after this sphere' 'Elohim tested Abraham.' The Devisor of Evil came to accuse him in the presence of the Blessed Holy One. Here we must reflect: 'Elohim tested Abraham. The v erse should read: 'tested Isaac,' for Isaac was already thirty-seven years old and his father was n o longer responsible for him. If Isaac had said, 'I refuse, his father would not have been punished. Wh y, then, is it written: 'Elohim tested Abraham,' an d not 'Isaac'! No, it had to be Abraham! He had to be crowned with Rigor. For until now, Abraham had no rigor at all. Now Water was crowned with Fire. Abraham was not complete until now when he was inve sted with the power to execute Judgment, to ordain it in its doma in. His whole life long, he had not been whole unti l now when Water was crowned with Fire, and Fire with Water. That is why 'Elohim tested Abraham,' not Isaac. He summoned Abraham to be crowned with Rigor. When he had done so, Fire entered Water, each compl eting the other. One was judged and one executed judgment, each crowning the other. That is why the Devisor of Evil appeared to accuse Abraham. For until he had executed judgment by binding Isaac he could not attain perfection. The D evisor of Evil always appears behind things and words; he comes to challenge. Come and see the secret of the word: Even though we have said that Abraham, not I saac, is designated in the verse, Isaac is secretly implied, for it is wri tten: 'Elohim tested et Abraham.' Not 'Abraham,' bu t 'et Abraham.' It is precisely this et that refers to Is aac. For until now, Isaac was dwelling in the spher e of low power. As soon as he was bound on the altar, initiated into Judgm ent by Abraham, he was arrayed in his own sphere alongside Abraham. Fire was crowned with Water; both rose higher. Thus the battle was joined: Water versus Fire Who has ever seen a compa ssionate father tur n cruel? It was only to reveal the polarity: Water versus Fire, each one arrayed in it s own sphere, until Jacob appeared and everything harmonized: the triad of the Patriarchs, the symmet ry of above and below.

Those r ays of color do not wait to be seen; they merge int o the fusion of zohar. In this zohar dwells the one who dwells. It provide s a name for the one who is concealed and totally unknown.

Here Jacob is found, perfection of the Patriarchs, linked to all sides. This zohar is called by the singled-out name : \"Jacob, whom I have chosen\" [Isaiah 41:8] Two names he is called: Jacob and Israel. At first , Jacob; later, Israel. The secret of this secret: First he attained the En d of Thought, the Elucidation of the Written Torah. She is the Oral Torah, called Be'er, as it is said: \"Mo ses began be'er, to explain, the Torah\" [Deuteronomy 1:5] She is a be'er, a well and an explanation of the o ne who is called Sheva, Seven, as it is written: \"I t took him sheva, seven, years to build it\" [1 Kings 6:38] Sheva is the Mighty Voice, while the End of Thought is Be'er Sheva. Jacob had entered this gateway to faith. Adhering t o that faith, he had to be tested in the same place his fathers had been tested, entering in peace and emer ging in peace. Adam entered but was not careful. Seduced by her, h e sinned with that whore of a woman, the primordial serpent. Noah entered but was not careful. Seduced by her, h e sinned as well, as it is written: \"He drank of th e wine and became drunk and uncovered himself within his tent\" [Genesis 9:21] Abraham entered and emerged, as it is written: \"And Abram went down to Egypt ... And Abram came up from Egypt\" [Genesis 12:10; 13:1] Isaac entered and emerged, as it is written: \"Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Ger ar ... From there he went up to Be'er Sheva\" [Genesis 26:1, 23] Jacob, having entered into faith, had to continue a nd probe the other side. For one who is saved from there is a loved one, a chosen one of the Blessed H oly One. What is written?

The secret of secrets: Out of the scorching noon of Isaac, out of the dregs of wine, a fungus emerged, a cluster, male and female together, red as a rose, e xpanding in many directions and paths. The male is called Sama'el, his female always included within h im. Just as it is on the side of holiness, so it is on the other side: male and female embracing one another. The female of Sama'el is called Serpent, Woman of Whoredom, End of All Flesh, End of Days. Two evil s pirits joined together: the spirit of the male is subtle; the spirit of the female is diffused in man y ways and paths but joined to the spirit of the ma le. She bedecks herself with all kinds of jewelry like an abhorrent prostitute posing on the corner to sed uce men. The fool who approaches her- she grabs him and kisses him, pours him wine from the dregs, from the venom of vipers. As soon as he drinks, he stray s after her. Seeing him stray from the path of trut h, she strips herself of all her finery that she dangl ed before that fool, her adornments for seducing me n: her hair all arranged, as red as a rose, her face white and red, six trinkets dangling from her ears, her bed covered with fabric from Egypt, on her neck all the jewels of the East, her mouth poised, a delicate opening, what lovely trappings!

What does she do' She leaves him sleeping in bed. She ascends, de nounces him, obtains permission, and descends That fool wakes up and plans to play with her as before. But she removes her decorations and turns into a powerful warrior confronting him. Arrayed in armor of flashing fire, his awesome terror vibrates the victim's body and soul. He is full of fearsome eyes ; in his hand a sharp-edged sword drips bitter drop s. He kills that fool and flings him into hell. Jacob descended to her, went straight to her abode, as it is said: \"and he set out for Haran.\" He saw all the trappings of her house and was saved from her. Her mate, Sama'el, was offended and swooped down to wage war but could not overcome him, as it is wr itten: \"And a man wrestled with him... \" [Genesis 32:25] Now he was saved and perfected, raised to a perfect sphere and called Israel. He attained a high rung, total perfection! He became the central pillar, of whom it is written: \"The center bar in the middle o f the planks shall run from end to end\" [Exodus 26:28] Index"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Joseph's Dream Joseph dreamed a dream and told it to his brothers, and they hated him even more. [Genesis 37:5] Rabbi Hiyya opened and said \"'He said, \"Hear my wor ds: If there be a prophet among you, I, YHVH, make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream\"' [Numbers 12:6] Come and see how many levels within levels the Bles sed Holy One has made, arranged one on top of the other, step by step, this one higher than that one, these absorbing those, as they should, these on th e right, those on the left, each one assigned its dom ain, all as it should be. Come and see: All the prophets of the world were nu rtured from a single aspect through two well- known levels. Those levels appeared in the mirror that do es not shine, as it is written: 'I make Myself know n to him in a vision, mar'ah.' What is this mar'ah? It h as been explained: a mirror in which all colors app ear. This is the mirror that does not shine. 'I speak with him in a dream.' This is one-sixtieth of prophecy, as they have established. It is the s ixth level from the level of prophecy, the level of Gabr iel, appointed over dreams. This has already been s aid. Come and see: Every proper dream comes from this le vel; so you cannot have a dream without false imaginings intermingling, as we have established. T herefore parts are true and parts are false. You cannot have a dream that does not reflect both this side and that. Since everything is contained in a dream, as we hav e said, all dreams of the world follow the interpretation of the mouth. They have established this based on the verse: 'As he interpreted for us, so it came to pass' [Genesis 41:13] Why? Because a dream includes illusion and truth, a nd the word rules over all. So a dream needs a good interpretation.\" Rabbi Judah said \"Because every dream is from that lower level, and Speech commands that level; that is why every dream follows the interpretation.\" He opened and said \"'In a dream, a vision of the ni ght, when slumber falls on humans as they sleep upo n their bed, He uncovers human ears, terrifies them w ith warning' [Job 33:15-16] Come and see: When a person climbs into bed, first he must enthrone and accept the Kingdom of Heaven, then say a verse of mercy, as the Comrades have established. For when a person sleeps in his bed, his soul leaves him and soars up above, each o ne on its own path. She ascends in this way, as has been said. What is written! 'In a dream, a vision o f the night,' when people are lying in their beds a sleep, the soul leaves them, as it is written: 'as they sl eep upon their bed, He uncovers human ears.' Then t he Blessed Holy One reveals to the soul, through that level presiding over dreams, things that are destin ed to come about in the world or things corresponding to the mind's reflections, so that the dreamer will respond to the warning. For nothing is revealed while the person is still u nder the spell of the body, as we have said. Rather , an angel tells the soul, and the soul, the person, and that dream is from beyond, when souls leave bodies and ascend, each on its own path. There are levels upon levels within the mystery of a dream, all within the mystery of wisdom. Now come and see: Dream is one level, vision is one level, p rophecy is one level. All are levels within levels, one above the other. 'Joseph dreamed a dream and told it to his brothers ... and they hated him even more because of his dreams' [Genesis 37:5, 8] From here we learn that a person should only tell his dream to one who loves him Otherwise the listener interferes, and if that dream is transformed, he is the cause. Come and see: Joseph told the dream to his brothers , and they made the dream disappear; for twenty- two years it was delayed.\" Rabbi Yose said, \"How do we know this' Because it i s written: 'They hated him even more.' This implies that they provoked accusations against him. What is written? 'He said to them, \"Please hear this dream that I have dreamed\"' [Genesis 37:6] He begged them to listen; then he revealed the dre am to them. If they had transformed its meaning, it would have com e true ac cording to their words. But they responded: 'Will you reign over us! Will you rule over us'' [Genesis 37:8] Suddenly they had revealed the interpretation of the dream and sealed their own fa te! That is why 'they hated him even more.' \" Index"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Seduction Above And Below And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph an d said, \"Lie with me!\" And he refused. Though she urged Joseph day after day, he did not y ield to her, to lie beside her, to be with her. [Genesis 39:7-8, 10] \"Though she urged him day after day\" Rabbi El'azar opened and said \"' [TO guard you from the evil woman, the smooth-tongued alien' [Proverbs 6:24] Happy are the righteous who know the paths of the B lessed Holy One, who learn how to follow them by striving for Torah day and night! For everyone who engages Torah days and nights occu pies two worlds: the higher world and the lower world. He obtains this world even if he engages in Torah with selfish motives; he obtains that w orld if he engages in Torah for the Name within her. Come and see what is written: 'Long life she offers with her right hand, with her left hand riches and honor' [Proverbs 3:16] One who walks on the right side of Torah is extend ed long life in the world that is coming. There he acquires the splendor of Torah, for the crown of Torah is in that world. 'With her left hand riches and honor' in this world. Even if he ha sn't studied Torah for the Name within her he still obtains in this world riches and honor. Now when Rabbi Hiyya came from Babylonia to the lan d of Israel he read from the Torah until his face shone like the sun, and when everyone studying Tora h stood before him he would say: 'This one engages Torah for the Name within her; that one does not.' He would pray for the first one that he always be l ike that and obtain the world that is coming. He would pray for the other that he discover how to study Torah for the Name within her and obtain eternal li fe. One day he saw a student toiling over Torah whose f ace turned pale. He said, 'This one is conceiving sinful thoughts!' He held him and looked into his e yes and emanated words of Torah to him until he became calm. From that day on, he resolved not to p ursue those evil imaginings and to strive to study Torah for the Name within her.\" Rabbi Yose said \"When a person sees that evil imagi nings are assailing him he should occupy himself with Torah and they will pass away.\" Rabbi El'azar said \"When that evil side approaches to seduce a human being he should pull it toward Torah and it will leave him. Come and see what we h ave learned: When that evil side confronts the Blessed Holy One, accusing the world of evil doings , the Blessed Holy One feels compassion for the world and offers a device to human beings to save t hemselves from him, to neutralize his power over them and their actions. What is the device? Engaging in Torah! This saves t hem from him. How do we know? Because it is written: 'A mizvah is a lamp; Torah is light; rules of discipline lead to life' [Proverbs 6:23] What is written in the following verse? 'To guard you from the evil woman, the smooth-tongued alien.' This is the unclean side, the Other Side, who constantly co nfronts the Blessed Holy One to press charges based on human sin, who constantl y confronts human beings to pervert and mislead the m below. He constantly presents himself above to report the sins of humans and accuse them of their doings so that they be delivered into his power as was done to Job. At the same time, he looms over humans below to mislead them and remind them of their sins, everything they have done. Especially when the Blessed Holy One stands in judg ment over the he rises to indict them and enumerate their sins. The Blessed Holy One, however, felt com passion for Israel and gave them a device to save themselves from him. What! A shofar on Rosh ha-Shan ah, and on Yom Kippur a scapegoat to give to him so that he leave them alone and occupy himself with that portion of his. This has been established . Come and see what is written: 'Her feet lead down t o death, her steps grasp the netherworld' [Proverbs 5:5] But of the mystery of faith, it is written: 'Her w ays are ways of delight, all her paths are peace' [Proverbs 3:17] These are the ways and paths of Torah. All is one, this peace and that death, reverse sides of each other. Happy is Israel's portion! They are perfectly linke d to the Blessed Holy One. He offers them guidance on how to be saved from all other tendencies in the wo rld since they are a people consecrated to Him. He"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"offers them guidance on everything. Happy are they in this world and in the world that is coming! Come and see: When this evil side comes down and ro ams through the world and sees how human beings act, how they all stray from their paths in this world, he ascends and accuses them. If the Ble ssed Holy One did not feel compassion for the work of Hi s hands, no one would survive! What is written' 'Though she urged Joseph day after day' She rises faithlessly every single day and uncovers for the Blessed Holy One so much evil news so that she can destroy humankind. What is written! 'He did not yield to her, to lie b eside her, to be with her.' He does not yield to he r request because He feels compassion for the world. 'To lie beside her' Why does she want Him to lie beside her' So she can take control and dominate th e world! Her control does not prevail until she is given power. Something else about 'to lie with her': as it is sa id: 'and the man who lies with an unclean woman' [Leviticus 15:33] 'To be with her,' to give her dignity, blessings, a nd help. For if she had help from above, not even a single person would remain alive. But the Blessed H oly One feels compassion for the world; so the world remains in existence.\" Rabbi Abba said \"It is all one path, but it is the Devisor of Evil who comes to seduce human beings, t o pervert their paths, to cling to them day after day . Time after time, he diverts one from the path of truth to force him off the path of life and draw him on t oward hell. A righteous person--what does he do? He watches his step on the path so the Devisor of Evil cannot cling to him, as it is written: 'Though she urged J oseph day after day, he did not yield to her,' to w hat she proposed day after day. For the unclean spirit, the Devisor of Evil, seduces a man every c 'to lie bes ide her' in hell, to be condemned there 'to be with her .' Come and see: When a person joins that side he is d rawn to her more and more; he defiles himself with her both in this world and the other world. Come and see this unclean side: it is ugly, it is f ilth. '\"Out!\" you will call to it' [Isaiah 30:22] Excrement! One who turns away from Torah is punished in excrem ent! Sinners of the world who do not believe in the Blessed Holy One are punished in excrement! What is written? 'One such day, he came into the ho use to do his work. There was no man of the household there inside' [Genesis 39:11] 'One such day,' a day when the Devisor of Evil is at large in the world, coming to lead humans astray. When is that d ay' The same day a person acknowledges his sins and begins to turn himself around, or when he engag es Torah and resolves to obey her commands. At that very moment, he descends to lead humans astray . 'He came into the house to do his work,' to engage Torah and obey her commands, for that is the work a person should do in this world. Now since a person' s real work in this world is the work of the Blesse d Holy One, he must be as strong as a lion on every s ide so that the Other Side will not overpower him o r be able to seduce him. What is written? 'There was no man,' no man to stan d up against the Devisor of Evil and wage war with him as one should. How does the Devisor of Evil operate? Once he sees that no man stands in his way, ready to fight him, immediately 'she grabbed him by his coat and said, \"Lie with me!\"' [Genesis 39:12] She grabbed him by his coat because when the Devisor of Evil takes con trol of a person he dresses him up in beautiful clothes and curls his hair and says, 'Lie with me! Join me!' One who is pure steels himself and wages war. What is written? 'But he left his coat in her hand and fled outdoors.' One should abandon him, harden oneself against him, flee from him to be saf e from him. Then he cannot take control.\" Rabbi Isaac said \"The righteous are destined to see the Devisor of Evil in the shape of a huge mountai n. Astounded, they will say: 'How were we able to over turn that huge mountain!' The wicked are destined to see the Devisor of Evil as thin as a thread of h air. Astounded, they will say: 'How could we fail t o overcome a thread of hair so thin?' These will cry and those will cry. The Blessed Holy One will sweep the Devisor of Evil off the earth and slaughter him before their eyes, and his power will be no more.

'You blind o nes' who do not examine your own foundations, who do not seek to know why you are alive! Every single day a herald comes forth and proclaims but no one hears his message! It has been taught: When a human being is created, on the day he comes into the world, simultaneously, all the days of his life are arranged above. One by one, they come flying down into the world to alert that human being, day by day. If, when a day comes to al ert him, he sins on that day before his Master, the n that day climbs up in shame, bears witness, and sta nds alone outside. It has been taught: After standing alone it sits an d waits for that human to turn back to his Master, to restore the day. If he succeeds, that day returns t o its place; if not, that day comes down to join fo rces with the outlaw spirit. It molds itself into an exa ct image of that human and moves into his house to torment him. Sometimes his stay is for the good if one purifies himself. If not, it is a horrible visi tation. Either way, such days are lacking, missing from the total. Woe to the human being who has decreased his days in the presence of the Holy King, who has failed to reserve days up above-- days that could adorn him in that world, days that could usher him in to the presence of the Holy King! Come and see: When those days draw near to the Holy King, if the person leaving the world is pure he ascends and enters into those days and they become a radiant garment for his soul!

Their days are all stored up with the Holy King, woven into radiant garments to be worn in the world that is coming We have learned in the mystery of our Mishnah: Why is it written: 'And they knew that they were naked' [Genesis 3:7] Adam and Eve knew the naked truth: the radiant gar ment woven from their days had faded away. Not one single day was left to wear, as it is written: 'Your eyes saw my unformed limbs; i n Your book they were all recorded. The days that wer e fashioned-- not one of them is left' [Psalms 139:16] Exactly! Not one of those fashioned days was left to be worn. And so it remained until Adam made the effort to turn back to God and mend his wa ys. The Blessed Holy One accepted him and made him different garments but not from his days, as it is written: 'YHVH Elohim made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and He clothed them' [Genesis 3:21] Come and see: Abraham, who was pure, what is writte n of him! 'He came into days' [Genesis 24:1] When he left this world he entered int o his very own days and put them on to wear. Nothin g was missing from that radiant garment: 'He came into days.' But what is written of Job' 'He said, \"Naked I came from my mother's womb and naked shall I return there\"' [Job 1:21] No garment was left for him to wear. It has been taught: Happy are the righteous for the ir days are pure and extend to the world that is coming. When they leave this world, all their days are sewn together, made into radiant garments for them to wear.
