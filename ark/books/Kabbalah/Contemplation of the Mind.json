As you read through you are likely to find it different from your regular Vipassan æ practice but very interesting, beneficial and enriching. Also it could be helpful in understanding your own practice better without having to ‘convert’ or change the way you meditate. This is about ‘the watching of the mind by the mind’ but not separating the mind from the rest of the Foundations of Mindful - ness ( kæya / body, vedan æ / feelings and dhamma / mental objects), as this is impossible. They arise together and are inseparable. A good meditator must be skillful with all of them. By prac - tising Cittænupassan æ one is practising all of them because when you observe anything, all Four Foundations of Mindfulness / Satipa¥¥hæna are already there anyway. INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! ‘Whether you are doing Kæya or Vedæna or any other combination, you have to reach the knowing mind, because this is how the Path is. There is no other way.’ Why do I like this approach? Because of the obvious distance that appears between object and observing, which leaves you without a doubt that there is ‘nobody there.’ The question most yogis ask at this point is: But does it work as with the Vipassanæ Ñæ¼as ? Yes it does ! As you go through these pages don’t expect to understand everything at a glance. However, it will all become very clear and simple to you once you go on retreat. I would like to make it very clear that this was written with enthusiasm but not antagonism towards other methods of practis - ing Satipa¥¥hæna or Samatha as I have an awful lot of respect for other ways of practising too. It was written because of appreciation and love for this very intelligent, effective and compassionate practice as taught in the style of Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw of Burma for the last forty-two years, but not as taught by any other teachers. There is a big difference between this practice and other approaches in teaching Cittænupassanæ Vipassanæ . It’s aiming to make this practice known to as many meditators as possible especially those who would be interested in the ‘mind’ aspect of Satipa¥¥hæna as well as those who are not entirely happy with their current practice. In case you are wandering, switching from regular Vipassanæ to Cittænupassan æ is not going to hurt your meditation. Rather it will make it richer. At least this has been my own personal experience."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n  5 It feels like a big step up from where my practice was before although I can combine the two when I want to. There are two main reasons for putting this book together: — Demand. There is absolutely nothing like it in print. And there never has been. When I was first interested in the ‘contemplation of the consciousness practice *, the first thing I did was to try to find information about it. I went to teachers and other monks, yogis and pub - lishers and they all gave me the same answer. There is absolutely nothing about it in print. Even later, in the Tawya, when I asked about it they said: ‘We don’t have any booklets, this practice is so simple, no need for books !’ — I must confess that this book was not my own idea. I never intended to get into all this amazingly distracting trouble of putting this together (just think of the critics alone!) But I was eventually persuaded by a publisher acquain- tance of mine. In no way is this to introduce me, as some ‘Dhamma book author’ but if by any chance and coincidence you appreciate it, that’ll make me very happy. It is more like a gift of Mett æ to all striving meditators everywhere. Most people ask, what is the difference between the Mahæsø method and this one? 1. At the end of my retreat with Sayædaw U Pa¼ðita, after reporting to him he said: ‘I want you to turn your attention to the mind now, the body doesn’t get into any finer particles.’"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! The practice is the same, the technique is different because the emphasis is on the mind. One more thing should be said here about practice. This is not an attempt to undermine any other method, as the ‘perfect method for everyone’ does not exist. Everyone must find his or her own way. And although this is a very big and interesting issue it lies out of the scope of this book. THE TEXT Some of the text is exactly as it was said, in the interviews, some reconstructed from notes and memory, some from memory only and some was from the teacher’s agreeing with what was said. But in all cases although some actual words might have been altered the meaning has been meticulously and uncompromisingly maintained. In any case if you need to blame somebody about anything at all that will be me alone. In the text, because of effectiveness as well as for sanity’s sake I’m not using ‘a question and answer’ format but rather the ques - tion is in the answer itself (look for it if you wish). As you go on you will find that this helps a lot to keep the flow of understanding of this teaching without missing anything at all. Sometimes you get the same question answered again but in different ways. That is a bonus for you. The comments, answers and instructions are not for the same level of meditators or at the same stage of progress in the retreat, but it is all displayed in such a way that it should leave you with no doubt about ‘where you are.’"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n  7 However everyone must keep in mind that different instruc - tions and advice are given to different persons in the course of practice depending on their understanding and mental and physi - cal capacity. To many ‘advanced’, ‘Dhamma spreading’, ‘know it all’, or ‘over fifty and idle!’ meditators out there this manual might seem like some ‘Teaching others how to meditate guide.’ Please make sure you understand this correctly: It is not ! So save your self and others the trouble. This is a meditator’s aid, a simple way of understanding what this practice is about. A qualified teacher must be approached for the purpose of getting help with this practice. Please keep in mind that the last chapter of Part I, titled ‘Transformer’ is not an attempt to ‘guide through’ or ‘teach’ the Vipassanæ Ñæ¼a s / Insights. But rather it highlights some of the most colorful, deep and transforming ones while ending Part I, in a rather inspiring way. CITTÆNUPASSAN Æ I am not going to write pages about it but only briefly define it, as you are expected to be familiar with the subject. If you are not, it’ll benefit you to do some of your own investigating before going any further. Cittænupassan æ is the ‘Contemplation of the Consciousness’ as mentioned in the Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta, or as most people understand it simply, ‘the watching of the mind.’"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! In the Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta, The Buddha teaches the Four Foundations of Mindfulness: Contemplation of the body / Kæyænupassan æ Contemplation of Feelings / Vedanæ nupassan æ Contemplation of Consciousness / Cittænupassan æ and Contemplation of Mental Objects / Dhammænupassan æ . But what is Contemplation of the Consciousness in practical terms? How is one to approach and work with the mind in a way that leads to ‘Liberation through Wisdom?’ This is the question this book will try to address to the fullest. If you know your mind then you can use the mind to look at your body and your feelings. The body you know with your mind, the feelings you know with your mind. It is basic to this form of meditation that you must know mind and body, but the mind is more important . That’s why it is emphasized here. The watching of the mind by the mind: Object Watching mind Noting mind"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n  9 SHWE Oo MIN SAYÆDAW This is not easy. One feels not up to commenting about the Sayædaw. So this will be just an attempt to make him a little known to you if you have not yet heard of him. The Sayædaw’s monk Pæ¹i name is Ashin Kosalla and he was born or the 15fth of September 1913. It is the custom in Burma that well established Sayædaws are given the name of the area they live in and teach. Most people know him as the most senior monk in the Mahæsø Sayædaw’s Sangha who forty years ago left the Mahæsø Sangha and started teaching in a modest and frugal monastery, the way he believed it really did justice to the practice. However he says that this is not his way of teaching, but the Buddha’s own. After Mahæsø Sayædaw died in 1982, Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw was offered the most prestigious position of being the incumbent teacher of the Mahæsø Yeiktha. He declined the offer because it would not allow him enough time for practising he said! And practice is another thing the Sayædaw is famous for. He has been practising every day of his life and he still is practising all day every day at the age of 88! The Sayædaw, who would have been one of Burma’s top exports had the world known about Cittænupassanæ , is very well known and respected in Myanmar (Burma), as well as outside Myanmar for being very advanced in his practice. But there is also something very different about him that you cannot miss. He is nothing like any other well-known, ‘big time’ Sayædaw and he is not interested in being one."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Most Venerable Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n  11 The absence of ‘persona’ on that monk is so obvious that it can be seen even in photographs! Something else you cannot miss is that this 88-year old Dhamma Teacher is always aware and sharp. Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw does not himself teach any longer, although he is open to discussion and prearranged interviews. DHAMMA SUKHA TAWYA Dhamma Sukha Tawya translates as Hermitage of Dhamma Happiness. It is Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw’s second monastery. His International Centre. Both Vipassanæ and Cittænupassanæ are taught in the centre in the style of Shwe Oo Min Sayædaw. The main characteristics of the Tawya would be: — Not a tension factory! — Definitely Dhamma conscious. In other well-known places monks and nuns who are not ‘fast progressing’ according to certain expectations are simply and coldly told to ‘go some - where else to practice’ or are looked down on, and so on. That’s not the case at all in Dhamma Sukha Tawya where patience and compassion are plenty for all. They also cater espe - cially for people with depression problems. The schedule in this monastery is arranged in such a way that one can practice, without having to take a pause if one wishes, indefinitely."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! EVAM ME SUTTAº... Mind is the forerunner. Everything that we know and experience is seen and touched first by the mind. It is the mind that is ‘The most amazing show on Earth and beyond’, by far. And so much more interesting and exciting than anything else, in this Satipa¥¥hæna practice. So would you like to watch? To follow, you may take with you one thing only: Awareness! You might experience some difficulty leaving everything else behind! As for myself I am eternally grateful to those who taught me Satipa¥¥hæna . The Buddha, The Dhamma, The Sangha. * When we practice in a way that, what we experience is a ‘pair’, an object and a knowing of it, we don’t experience the knowing of it as an object by itself, but very easily we take it as an ‘ I ’."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n  13 We are told that this knowing is not an ‘ I ’ and that it is unstable; but that, is an understanding of an intellectual nature. Because it is not easy for us to experience it first hand in this way. When we actually practise it, is very hard to see that it is not ‘ I ’ who is thinking, paining, wanting, planning, and feeling angry. So most people don’t know the knowing mind and very rarely they might get to the point where they can see the knowing mind which is aware of the object. The only way to go beyond this kind of understanding is to experience that knowing or noting mind as object. Only when we practice Cittænupassanæ we can clearly see that another knowing mind arises and becomes aware of the noting mind as its object. And yet another knowing mind arises and is aware of all of the above! And so on. Then we can clearly see that noting mind is object and not ‘I’. The idea of ‘knowing’ as ‘I’ simply doesn’t make sense any more. And that, is not intellectual understanding, that is experiential understanding, that is Dhamma."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! People who come from other kinds of practising, often find it difficult to stop having as reference point-anchor the rising and falling, of the abdomen. Once you get familiar and able to see the noting mind you will find that the noting mind is just as big and reliable if not bigger than the abdominal movement to have as reference point-anchor, in the practice. The noting mind in this practice is the reference point- anchor, and all other minds are objects. However Ænæpæna and the rising and falling of the abdomen can be used here too."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"‘There should always be the greatest effort possible without forcing, without creating tension.’ ‘Insight comes from the realization that observation is going on without the observer. Witnessing is going on without the witness.’ ‘An ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of theory.’ FROM SHWE Oo MIN SAYÆDAW : Put your mind at the solar plexus. Don’t label. Just be aware of what is happening. If you hear something, just know there is hear - ing. If you know what sound it is you are hearing, this is not medi - tation.

It’s only meditation when there are two minds: Knowing / noting mind and observing mind. If there is only one mind, ‘ I ’ is always there. The object is not the dhamma , The dhamma is the mind That is being aware. You don’t need to follow the objects or identify or know them. Awareness will do it’s own work. Even when the person sleeps the Dhamma does not sleep, even when you are near death and you are overcome by exhaus - tion, the feeling of being overcome is just the feeling of being over - come , knowing it, is separate from the sensation. INITIATION The watching of the mind by the mind. With all practices, in all postures: Standing, walking sitting, lying down, eating etc. Watch the mind."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  17 Look into the mind, don’t worry about the body so much. With daily activities watch the mind’s reactions to objects. (The outside world and the inside world, so to speak, always react they are in a cause and effect relationship). There’s no need to walk and move very slowly, just the way you normally walk and move in a relaxed manner will do fine. Adapt to an easy normal pace. If it helps you, slowing down, you can by all means. In sitting meditation stay with that ‘which knows’ everything. Don’t try to go to objects. Let the object come to you. Try not to react to objects. Whatever arises, greed, aversion, pain, itchiness, Mett æ , likes or dislikes etc. — watch with equanimity, without getting involved, without clinging to anything. Stay in the middle path. As the watching mind ‘looks’ directly at the noting mind, pass - ing by objects are seen as if they are being looked by the corner of the eye — not directly — Watch the quality of the mind as it contacts objects. If you see any kind of tension in the mind relax immediately. Tension is excessive energy. You can also start with rising and falling and as the mind encounters objects observe the mind not the object. That is the easiest way for some, including my self. Move with the mind not with the object. So don’t think in terms of, what’s the object? When you sit, but what does the mind know of as its object. Look at that know - ing of the mind."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! Don’t fix your attention on the object of the knowing mind but look at what that mind knows next, as you let the objects come to the mind. The next moment might be a knowing of a sound, the moment after that a knowing of a rising of the abdomen, next moment a knowing of a sensation in the body or mind and so on. Follow that trail of knowings, from moment to moment con - tinuously and in a relaxed manner. The mind that arises and observes the knowing mind is what we call the watching mind. It will all become clear to you once you get familiar with the practice. The knowing mind is also known as noting mind and the watching mind is also known as the observing mind. Both these ‘minds’ are consciousness or citta . Note the mind constantly but silently, without labelling. At all times don’t worry about the body. Try to see the observer, the one who watches that mind. Be mindful at all times, continuously. Don’t fix the mind on anything at all. Let the mind do the job and just watch. Watch that anger, watch that greed, and watch that impa - tience or confusion. Watch these emotions and mind states, what are they doing, as they are being watched? If you experience pain watch the reaction of the mind to it, don’t worry about the pain at all. (More about pain to come.) Can you see what wisdom is in the mind, or viriya , what is concentration like in the mind or mindfulness?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  19 It’s not hard to watch, just recognize: that is the nature of this — this is what it feels like. The mind has a strong desire to practise, what does that feel like? Eagerness to think so much is intention. Observe intention. As you watch the invisible forces that move you every day and bounce you around, discover and face a new world appearing. Just keep practising and all the questions you have, will be answered. Wisdom just arises by practising and answers all your question s! Try to see why the mind is tense or relaxed, what lies under - neath that? Do not do any labelling — labelling is a hindrance to this practice. Key word: Look into the mind moment to moment. When ‘I-ness’ is there it’s because of delusion. When tension is there defilement creeps in strongly, but when wisdom gets strong it easily protects the mind. To be able to see the mind that observes the noting mind and the noting mind, you got to have the right balance, not try too hard. The more you try to see the harder it becomes. Remember the Burmese four-fold saying: ‘Not too forcefully, not controlling or manipulating, not trying to make it happen and not causing tension: observe it as it is. What it seems like is seeing it from the corner of your eye. Don’t look at it forcefully with open eyes!’"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! FROM SAYÆDAW U JOTIKA: ( Transcribed from a talk by the Sayædaw ) In all human activities, this meditation practice is the most impor - tant. (But note that when we say ‘without thinking about it’ we don’t mean absent minded.) Let’s see why we don’t even use noting . For example when we hear something and try to label, ‘ This is a dog bark ’. To come to this conclusion we need a very complicated process in the mind. First you hear the sound and recall from the past similar sounds that you heard, you put the two together, then the mind works very fast like a computer. Recognizes. This is the same as that, and then you recall what it was called in the past, and you remember that, that was a dog barking in the past and you bring that past to the present, ‘ This sound is a dog barking ’. You go through four different processes, four steps, in order to get to that. In this meditation you stop at the first step, no more. Even to name something you go through many-many steps, like when we hear one word, if the sound is one syllable you go four full steps, if it has two syllables we go though more than four, maybe six or eight sometimes and if the sound has three or four syllables we have to go through many-many steps to get to the conclusion. The mind works very fast very hard. In this meditation prac - tice we stop all that process we stay with the first step. That sim - ple. But it’s not easy to do that because we have a habit of going through the whole process."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  21 But as I said before if you practise it, you don’t find it very difficult either. It is just the act of being, when you see there is just ‘seeing’ when you hear there is just ‘hearing’ when you have any sensa - tions in the body, there is just sensations, when you taste there is just ‘tasting’ when you smell there is just ‘smelling’, when you think there is just ‘thinking.’ Not even ‘ I ’ experiencing that. Because that ‘ I ’ can make things become very complicated. Of all human activity, body and mind, this is the simplest. The act of just ‘being’ in all it’s simplicity and naturalness with nothing added at all. That is the most important point: nothing added at all . It’s just the experience of simple ‘being’, experience of simple process. So in practising this meditation do not expect anything to happen. That is also another important thing. Especially for those of you who have been meditating for quite a while, a long time and who have had good experiences before; whenever they meditate again they always want to get to that state as quickly as possible. They expect that. ‘I have been into that peaceful state before. Now I am going to sit and get there as quickly as possible’. The harder we try the harder it becomes. So don’t try, don’t expect. This is another paradox. If you really don’t try anything at all you will find that you are there."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! To be as simple as possible — nothing added — sit as com - fortable as possible, without overlapping anything. The most important thing is to be balanced and to be at ease. If you can sit full lotus it’s ok. I used to sit like that before but I don’t try it any more. It’s not necessary. In those detached, peaceful clear moments nothing seems to be very important. Only a few fundamental truths appear very clearly such as impermanence, egolessness, craving, suffering, greed and delusion.... WHY CITTÆNUPASSANÆ Emphasizing the mind is most important. If you know your mind then you use the mind to look at your kæya / body and vedanæ / feelings. The kæya you know with your mind, the vedanæ you also know with your mind. If you get skilful with Cittænupassan æ then you can do Dhammænupassan æ . The basics of Vipassanæ meditation requires that you know both the body and mind, but the mind is more important . So that is why it is emphasized here. When we meditate, we use our minds — that is why we should look at our mind. Cittænupassanæ is part of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness; therefore we should know the mind. When you observe anything, all four foundations of Mindfulness are already"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  23 there anyway. You must know rþpa and you must also know næma — only then you will have an all-rounded view and knowledge. The mind will be able to work smoothly only if you understand the nature of the mind that is working. When you understand the nature of the sati , the samædhi , the viriya , then you can really ascertain whether they are working properly of not. Next, the defilements / kilesa only happen in the mind. If you are not aware of their presence in the mind, you will find you can - not meditate well. If you don’t know what attitude you are practising with and you are having the wrong attitude, you cannot achieve anything in the Dhamma . Between the knowing mind and the object, if you don’t know the mind, you cannot see true paramattha . If you know-observe just only the object, you cannot be com - pletely free from concepts. And whether you are doing kæya or vedanænupassan æ or any - thing you have to reach the knowing mind because this is how the Path is. There is no other way. The practice of the Dhamma is such that you must come to this point where you know the knowing mind, awareness; being aware of your awareness. Every practice must come to this point. Knowing mind is the mind that knows the object, watching mind or ‘one step up mind’ is the one that knows of both of them. Most people don’t know the knowing mind, and don’t get to the point where they can see the knowing mind that knows the object."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! According to the Abhidhamma, these cittas / consciousness that arise one after the other and know of the process of con - sciousness that proceed them can actually arise infinitely. But to know just these two or three, is enough for you to be able to see that process and not confuse it with a self or personality. It’s only when you get to the mind that you get to real para - mattha . When you get to reality you don’t see any more concepts. You see just the basic reality; only paramattha and you can see this only through the mind. If you don’t see how the mind works you don’t know how the mind creates these concepts. Concepts are created by the mind. If you do not see that the concept is created by the mind you cannot see through it, you cannot stop it. About the practice, when you are very high level and your sati and samædhi is very strong then what happens is, that you are looking at the knowing mind and the objects come to the know - ing mind. You don’t have to go looking for the object. The objects keep coming to the mind. You are aware of this, you are aware of that; The rising and falling, The way the mind makes up things, something is always there. Of course you don’t see a head or feet or hands or something like this, there is no concept involved, but some object is coming to the knowing mind."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  25 It is not like we are aware of being aware of nothing, the object doesn’t disappear. The objects are always there, we don’t need to go down and focus on the objects. Like you don’t have to choose what object you want to know; you know the mind and the mind knows objects continuously one after the other. Objects do not stop. With Cittænupassanæ you have to have a teacher who teaches from experience, it can not be taught from the book. To teach Cittænupassanæ effectively the teacher and the student must have a close relationship and close contact and the student must be very honest and be able to explain his experiences very clearly and openly. The kind of mind and attitude one practices with is very important. Satipa¥¥hæna is the most important thing. It is the way of continuously practising and if you are practis - ing really continuously there is no way you are not going to see the mind. Your sati and samædhi will be so strong that you are going to know that this is the mind; you need a lot more strength of mind to see citta than to observe rþpa ."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! If you want to be very effective you have to practise quite dili - gently. The mind you see is very subtle and very fast. You really need to apply your self. If the mind is completely relaxed then the body will be relaxed too. If there is some tension in the body it means that the mind is not completely free of tension. That is why you have to continue to watch what you can watch, that is, the tension in the body. When the tension in the mind becomes completely zero all this will be very clear to you. (Zero is a balanced level where everything is nice and balanced and makes you feel very awake and light). So remember, body relaxed, and mind relaxed — but alert! First you have to ask the yogi to watch his mind or what does he feel in the mind. If he can feel the mind that is fine. So it is not so much to look but feel it and observe it like this. Pay attention to the feeling rather and not the place (where one imagines the mind to be). As a teacher you always have to separate the conceived reality from the absolute reality for the student. You always have to remind them that this part is concept, and that part is reality. Ask the yogis: what is the mind doing now? Everyone can tell you what their mind is doing now.

The other thing is you have to tell them to make sati- samædhi strong. How you do this? Continuous practice. You practice continuously, moment-to-moment awareness. Then your sati- samædhi become more and more continuous, your mind becomes very strong, and becomes easier to see the mind. Actually people think that this mind is so difficult to look at, but who is I? Every body goes round making this mind into ‘me’ and that makes it so difficult to look at, because of the personality in between. If sati- samædhi is weak you can’t see it. If sati- samædhi is strong then things become very clear. Actually there is not ‘ I ’. It’s just the mind. You ask people: What’s happening in the mind? Observing this is Cittænupassanæ . What work is the mind doing? What is the function of the mind? If you are aware of anger for example, that is looking at the state of the mind. That is also Cittænupassanæ . Cittænupassanæ is the watching of the mind. With everything we do, all activities without exception, there is the mind that knows of what we are doing, and the mind that observes that, and makes sure we don’t get forgetful. ‘The watch - ing of the mind by the mind.’ Anything to do with the mind is Cittænupassanæ ."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! UNDER YOUR SKIN A Quick Look At The Hindrances: •There are pleasant and unpleasant hindrances. For example, pleasant visual hindrances such as the Buddha or the Sangha, Temples, Teachers etc. •They promote faith. But too much faith brings blind devotion unless it is balanced with wisdom. If there was wisdom in the first place one would have ignored the encouraging images. Pleasant Bodily Sensations: • Just look at them until they disappear. • Pøti gives rise to joy; calm / passadhi , gives rise to comfort, to no pain, mental clarity inner happiness and so on, (caused by samædhi ). • Note, observe, and do not get attached. Unpleasant Hindrances: • Sleepiness-restlessness-boredom-doubt-remorse, (caused by lack of samædhi ). • Sleepiness : With good sati look at it directly without getting involved. If sati is weak look at the properties of sleepiness: dark, heavy, foggy and so on. By continuously applying your self you will be able to over - come it. Sleepiness is only a mental state. • Restlessness : Return to rising and falling until your mind gets calm enough to overcome it. Check for tension in your body and mind. Tension is the mother of restlessness."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  29 • Balancing the mind : Look straight into the thinking mind. That will cause it to disappear. Then turn your attention to the rising and falling for three or four times and look right into the mind again checking for thinking / restlessness. If there is restlessness turn your attention again to the ris - ing and falling for a few breaths and look again into the mind checking for thinking. Work like this again and again balancing the mind until thinking mind is totally overcome. • Boredom : Seeing repetition and getting bored. Remind your self that what you are seeing is always new. Every breath, every thought, every image, every step or movement, you experience is brand new. Mark the ending of experience carefully. • Doubt : Before anything else see the teacher because different methods apply. Look into this doubt mind, no reason to get alarmed, it’s a very natural thing, but if questions arise while you are practis - ing don’t try to answer them. Leave them for later. • Remorse : Again, see the teacher before anything else, because different methods apply. Don’t let it affect you, or the present moment.

An experienced practitioner would check his mental atti - tude first and then check bodily sensations and would avoid looking at the mental image. Will drop the image immediately, and again and again if necessary. The difficulty one faces with the dropping of the image, shows the strength of the attachment. This last method works with all sense objects. This latest practice will help you understand how mental attitudes and mental feelings cause you to suffer. • Sexual Desire : In this case check your mental attitude first, then chest-heart area for mental feelings, totally ignore image and keep checking as before again. If there is change in mental attitude you will feel it; i.e. men - tal heaviness, contraction, chest-heart area, or pleasantness and so on. Also use your wisdom, see the bad side in what seems attrac - tive and desirable, think of the results or the price you have to pay for sense pleasure. Look at what’s coming, what’s following pleasant feeling. Observe that feeling. This does not mean start feeling guilty! As you observe continuously, the unpleasant feeling will decrease. (Your observing has to be at present moment, but to be able to do that, your mental attitude has to be right.) Observe sensation until it goes down to zero.

This means that you have to face the situation at the begin - ning and not ignore it until it’s too late. Check very carefully your attitude: If there is wrong attitude there and you are able to see it clearly, acknowledge it, that ‘seeing’ by itself will change and turn in time that negative attitude into positive. Do not change object until your present object zeros. If sati is strong, usually the mental feeling will decrease to zero, then the mental attitude will change to upekkha / neutral feeling, and the mental image will disappear and bodily sensation will break up or it will be just another sensation. For a seasoned Cittænupassanæ meditator the looking at the mental attitude changing will cause the image to disappear and the bodily sensation to break up.

You want it to go for good. (Back and front of the mind are just concepts). • The arising of lobha / greed : When you come into contact with objects the mind conceptualizes and says to you: ‘This is good, useful, harmless...you can’t do without it... just this once’! Gives you all the positive qualities. That’s when lobha arises. That’s the cause of lobha . If we just observe the ‘seeing’ process then lobha will not arise. Lobha can not differentiate between want and need. Dosa / anger, cannot differentiate between right and wrong. These mind states are already in moha / delusion, and can - not know what is appropriate or not and cannot see causes and effects. Kilesa is not mature. But if you can see your mind feeling lobha , dosa , comparing itself to this or that, then this mind that is aware is more mature, it has sati , it is knowing, it is not blind. Defilements are not simple , and they don’t let you be simple. They confuse you (they are of a confusing, deluding nature) they delay you on the path, distract you and push you out of the right way. Always remember, whatever arises in the mind and body in this practice, is to be observed with equanimity. We never get involved or identify with the objects in any way at all. We let them go their way and just watch. They are just tem - porary activities of the mind and can be overcome.

So assuming that you can look into your mind, Cittænupassanæ starts with observing the characteristics of the consciousness; if you recognize the work that they do, that is their characteristic. You are aware of some object and the mind that is aware of that object. You know this mind as the noting mind or conscious - ness or citta . Then another consciousness-citta arises which is aware-watches over the first one which is aware of object and arises with the object and because of the object. It knows what this first one is doing, knows its ‘whereabouts’ object and behaviour. This consciousness is called watching mind, or one step up mind. Once an object hits the field of awareness the noting mind is automatically there. The watching mind is watching-knowing what the noting mind is doing-experiencing.

Look at all these perfect reasons that it gives you. Don’t take it for real, just keep looking at it. Then if you have to move, move. There’s no rule that says not to move. Try to see the ending of the noting mind. It happens very sud - denly; like a snap of the fingers. Don’t get attached to happiness, to peace, to comfort, in sit - ting meditation. Keep your mind balanced all the time. Fly free. You don’t think, do I like this or do I not like this, but think should I do this or should I not do this. Watch out for that liking mind! Don’t try to stop others disturbing you, it is impossible! Personality is more like an idea in the mind, a thought. Which way are you going to go concept or reality?

When there is blank as you watch your mind, don’t take it as ‘practice gone wrong’. Blank, is object. Nothingness is not nothing ! Also your reaction to it, the mental state that arises because of it: No object, what do I do now? It’s another object, don’t miss it. Save your energy to last you until the end of the day. Never think like: ‘In the morning it is best, let’s put all the effort then.’ Just practise. Save your energy to go through the whole day, until the end of it.

Do you have greed, anger, expectations, or aversion in that mind that is meditating?

Deal with it until it clears, then turn you attention to your walking, until something appears in the mind again. Then turn your attention to the mind, observe the mind.

When you speak bring happiness to everybody. Others will respect you for it and take you seriously. When you are mindful you are above all things and people will respect you and pay attention to what you have to say. No talking is for beginners, the Buddha said, be mindful when you are speaking or when you are silent. So learn to speak and be silent mindfully. Speak with awareness, listen with awareness. As soon as you are approached by people alert yourself to be mindful with talking, without getting emotionally involved . Watch out when the other person stops talking and its your turn to speak. Don’t rush into it out of control, like we usually do and lose our mindfulness."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  39 Speak slowly and short so that the other person slows down too.

In order to keep mindful when you speak, don’t follow your emotions . The moment you start liking this or disliking that — cling - ing — the mind gets carried away. Every phrase you say, look at the mind over and over again and check for right speech and mindfulness. The mind has to try to be aware of itself. Try to be aware all the time of the mind watching the mind. Keep the finger on the big one! Keep the finger on the big one means: Are you in control or being controlled? Is the mind collected or scattered? Maintain that distance between object and knowing mind. Stay with the ‘one step up mind’. Apply this to all practices. When your mind has a lot to do, has to do more work, it progresses better. Watch the mind all the time. Then you will understand how it works.

When greed arises look particularly for the specific characteris - tics (form, taste) that make you want it so much, look at it carefully. Do you really want it so much? Just how much? For how long? Viriya is the effort you make to be constantly observing the noting mind. When the mind is tired and not strong enough change to an easier object (in sitting).

It weakens the mind, it weakens sati and samædhi . Even a why or what is bad enough. The mind gets tired in a way that it loses energy and needs rebuilding . When it comes to knowing for yourself, you do not need to use words because you already know what it is. In fact when you start knowing really subtle sensations and mind states, no words can describe them because words are mostly for all the gross reali - ties we know. So words are really not helpful, they can even get in the way. Thought happens in the mind. The mind is immaterial. (Immaterial here means: not of matter). Don’t negotiate with hindrances and unprofitable things. Look at them straight in the eye, look straight into that mind. Whatever it is it will disappear and won’t come back. Do not put it aside. The easier and simpler you lifestyle is, the easier it is to keep your mindfulness. Mindfulness keeps your life simple and easy, you make less mistakes, in life and you suffer less. Meditating is knowing what is going on, being mindful. Not about trying to stop what is going on, or trying to have an experience that is not there. The most basic and important factor in meditation is to be in the present moment and have no thoughts or words about what you are knowing; this is paramattha .

The mind cannot remain without an object to attend to, when it’s not knowing anything, it tends to think and that tires the mind. Our minds are in the habit of identifying with concepts that have been given to us since we were born. These concepts hide reality from us. When meditating, the mind is taking a rest from concepts. It gives no name to what it is experiencing. It only knows what is happening directly without any thoughts about it. This can be an amazing experience. With all practices just ask: where is awareness now, what is it doing? That’s Cittænupassanæ the correct way. Another way, is to be able to watch constantly, if the mind is forgetful or collected, and this instruction comes directly from The Buddha himself , about the contemplation of the consciousness. In sitting when sati gets stronger you’ll see that the mind doesn’t go anywhere, objects come to its field of awareness. But the mind moves very fast within its field of awareness. Bored? Look at that boredom, until you can see what is behind that. Most likely it is unhappiness. Look at this unhappiness until you can see what is behind that. You will find kilesa there. Once you can see kilesa and come face to face with it and acknowledge it, a change of attitude, will take place in the mind which will eliminate that kilesa . Without you having to do any - thing at all. This process of contemplating like this, can take place as you keep walking or sitting down.

You will find there are two things there: sati and kilesa , both trying to take over the mind. So don’t be surprised that in the proc - ess of contemplation, it might take you up to thirty minutes some - times before sati predominates and the mind is really cleared. Be aware: aware in every context-contact in time and whatever the experience might be without resisting anything. This is the only spiritual exercise worth practising. Only what you can know by feeling-sensing directly is real. Thoughts-concepts are just that, they are not reality. The life of the spirit is the life that lives exclusively in the present, here and now, nowhere in the past or future. The knowledge you get from meditating is so direct and simple, you need not philosophize nor analyze to know it. It just is, you just know. People think they know themselves well, but this is not true; what they know is a lot about themselves. If you really know your own mind the greed, the delusion, the anger, the unwholesome - ness that drives the mind, then these will slowly decrease. When you understand your mind you are no longer at its mercy.

You will be able to see how the mind creates its own problems and unhappiness. It is necessary to just look and know the state of the mind. There is no need to correct, or change, or control the mind, just know what it really is. Know your feelings, how a mind state affects you and without thinking further on the subject, just know what you can experience directly, i.e. the feeling of anger or doubt, disgust. And when the feeling decreases see how the state of the mind has changed. There is no need to justify or stop what you are feeling. (What you can sense and know directly). Thoughts are merely your assumptions not what you know really or directly. When meditating, if you come across interesting experiences do not try to make them happen again. You don’t want to re- experience second hand experiences. That will cause unnecessary agitation. What you can experience is only what is happening in the present, now . Samædhi on it’s own, is not worth achieving unless it helps in getting greater sati . When there is hearing of something, keep your mind at the ear.

As soon as you look at it, it disappears. Most important, the mind has to be in the present moment. Only then it can see paramattha . Truth. Ultimate reality. A person with sati chooses simply what has better quality, whether it is his actions, words, speech or thoughts, and so the quality of his or her life improves. If you do not do what you have to do with quality, it can destroy your whole life. With sati you are aware, the moment you get excited, angry, upset, so it doesn’t grow to extreme limits. So you regain calmness and control more quickly. At this point in time it is good to have a teacher to guide you. Don’t try to get higher and higher in the practice but first try to maintain what you got. When some memory (good or bad) comes what’s important is that you don’t let it affect you any more . Just stay with the present moment. With all practices: everything you do, see arising and passing away. Where is the comfort? Slowly if you have awareness you will automatically see.

Maturity has nothing to do with age; some people are sixty but they are not mature yet. Some people are thirty but they are only fifteen in the mind. When bad, unpleasant things will come in the practice, you must keep going on so that the mind will get up to the point when wisdom wants to be free from this process. If you want freedom from suffering first you have to see what suffering is. (Every næma and rþpa is suffering). You will not want any arising and passing away any more. You will want to be free from all that. Just stay always in present moment and you will see; all this wisdom is in you and slowly growing and knowing what to do. Use your mindfulness to wake up this wisdom and help it grow. To see the arising and passing away of the mind and object is important for the realization of the three characteristics ( anicca, dukkha, anatta ). Can you see that the mind that wants to be active and the mind that is sleepy are separate? If you are aware of these as separate, this is Cittænupassan æ .

Meditation is to teach the mind to become cultured, refined and flexible. There is no expectation of the practice on you because you want to see what it presents to you, as it is. In order to realize the Dhamma you will need to see arising and passing away eventually. But as you practice meditation you should have no expectations to see arising and passing away. Everything is actually arising and passing away; so you just watch whatever you see. If you have expectations to see arising and passing away you won’t see arising and passing away. Don’t expect ñæ¼a s (insight knowledge) or anything. What you need to know is how to meditate the right way. If you do that, all phenomena will show their true nature to you. Do you have greed, anger, expectations, or aversion in that mind that is meditating? Can you see in your mind as you are med - itating your own attitudes, your own mind sets, views opinions and ideas in that mind? If you don’t, you are not really practising .

Those who practice Cittænupassanæ see the hidden side of their minds more. They see the defilements and this is important because only if you see your own defilements you know how to note and deal with the defilements when they arise in the mind. This is very important. When you have no defilement and your practice is going ok that’s not a problem, but if defilement arises what are you going to do? When you come across the hindrances you must know how to handle them, how to note them effectively so that you can get past them because they are obstacles on the path. They block progress. So to know the mind is very, very important in order to progress. If you only know the wandering mind it is not enough. You have to practice Cittænupassanæ as well as all other Anu - passanæs , (Four Foundations of Mindfulness) other wise your practice is not complete. NOTING EFFECTIVELY MEDITATION EXPERIENCES Always remember that when we say ‘noting’ in this practice we mean wordlessly . Labelling in this practice is not used at all. • Dealing with Anger : Say that you are experiencing anger. Anything to do with that anger you observe it, whether is the feelings, your body sensa - tions, your mental activity and sensations. Any of it, if you look at it, is called noting your anger."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  49 But if you are repeating anger, anger, anger, to your self, this is not called noting. Because now your mind is looking at the word anger, and you are not thinking about what you are angry about any more. You are not thinking about the story line any more. But you are also not looking at anything that you are experiencing directly that is related to anger in your body and your mind. If you are not observing any of this bodily and mental activ - ity you are not noting, you are just repeating a word to your self. Noting means looking at the bodily and mental activity that is happening in the present moment. Others — in other traditions — when they feel anger they start asking: Who is angry? Who is the entity that is angry. And they forget all about anger and noting that anger! That is not noting. You are not noting the direct effects of the experience you are having, but diverting the attention to something else . It has to be the direct effects of the experi - ence. Has to be direct experience. Try not to judge your own anger, because that doubles the trouble. You have the anger pain and the judging pain to deal with at the same time. Look at the feeling of anger and it loses its power. Look at the story and it gets stronger. When you are dealing with anger, look straight into it."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! Don’t want it to go away. If you have that attitude no matter how much you try it’s not going to go away. So simply look at it. Look right into it. Sometimes people watch their anger and expect it to disappear immediately. Don’t expect that. Just learn how to look into your mind. Use that anger to learn from. Consider these two ways of dealing with anger: — Being reasonable and thinking if the other person is actu - ally not aware of making you angry or he has a reason to behave the way he does. — Watch that sensation in your body and mind, don’t judge and don’t elaborate. Just stick with the knowing mind, don’t worry about the object. Also do not expect all sorts of pains and problems to disap - pear quickly. Even when you take medicine pains do not go away instantly. With Vipassanæ you cannot hurry things up. Just stay mind - ful all the time and in good time things will happen. * When the yogi does walking meditation he notes ‘lifting’, his samædhi is very strong and he can see the lifting of the foot in his mind but does not feel the sensations of the lifting at all ! This is not noting. So if things do not work, if the object does not decrease, or it is not clear enough you have to check your noting."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  51 Another thing that is good to check always is your attitude. What is your attitude about the practice now? Is there lazy mind, bored mind, not relaxed? Clear the mind so that you can apply yourself. Cittænupassanæ is about the content of the mind, observing it, feeling it. Whatever happens in your mind do not avoid it, don’t try to make it go away. Look at the feeling, let yourself experience it, see the reason why it arose in your mind and make this a habit in your practice always. Don’t get carried away by pleasant feeling or unwholesome feeling. If the rising and falling becomes subtle look at that mind that observes the rising and falling. Watching the subtle object requires more effort. Beginners can take a grosser object for observation if they cannot observe it. However trying to see the subtle object will make your sati- samædhi strong. When you look at the mind but you are not so strong the mind wanders."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! PAIN If you don’t want to look at the pain that’s fine; then look at the mind. You must start looking at the mind the moment that the pain begins, not when it’s already very strong, because then it’ll be too difficult to be able to watch the mind. Watch the mind, the way it reacts, the way it feels, the way it speaks to you. Then you’ll find that the pain disappears. (This also works with likes and dislikes). To be able to look in the mind you have to be more skilful, because it is not as easy as looking at the pain, which is very obvi - ous. If you look in the mind and you still see the pain, change and look at the discomfort of the situation. There are many different levels of discomfort that you can look at, there. Just choose one. With pain the most important thing is to relax, clear the mind, do not allow agitation to reach high levels. If you choose to watch the painful sensation, then just relax into it. Don’t use the word pain for noting it. It will only make things worse. Don’t think this is pain, you don’t even think at all. You are just with it relaxing into it. You might have realized by now that pain or any other sen - sation is not yours, does not in any way belong to you. It is only sensation, just sensation going its own way. You don’t think about you.

(Must never forget) ! Keep the level of sati steady throughout the day. No gaps, no loops. Do not get involved with mental impressions, stay in con - trol, don’t listen to the mind don’t follow the mind, or what the mind wants. Just observe. This will lead to equanimity. Practising mindfulness, in the beginning without labelling might feel not so strong, or not so solid but that kind of mindfulness is actually much stronger than when you are practising with labelling. In all practices see arising and passing away, in this way the mind gets stronger and less attached. Then mindfulness will see anicca automatically everywhere. Keep the finger on the big one (mind), know what the noting mind is doing. Don’t label; just know. Reactions, moods, motivations, and postures: are to be kept aware of.

Let things come to you. Don’t go after them. Don’t get too slack in the last sitting ! Go to sleep meditating. Don’t get tense during the day. That is making you tired. Check always for tension. Don’t react automatically — be mind - ful. Your life depends on the quality of your mind. Never do anything in a hurry, never be upset, and never boast! Look at that mind and liberate the moment, each moment. Make sati your companion. ‘I will not harm myself or others.’ If you harm anyone in any way it is going to affect your practice and hinder it. Be patient and forgiving, you can’t go through life without being hurt. If the ‘worse person in the world’ happens to be next to you doing the most unacceptable things and you start judging, dislik - ing, comparing, hating, even trying to control, you have totally failed in your practice ! Difficult or unpleasant situations or people? Accept, watch sensation, stay inside yourself, and don’t go out of yourself. If you see a person that you don’t like, don’t look at that per - son, look at your mind. (Do not follow the dislike in your mind! Just watch it). That person might be passing you by.

That’s irrelevant. Just be aware of the feeling of anxiety. Use your mett æ to protect you from enemies and negativity. Before you act look at who is behind the scenes. Is it lobha ? Is it dosa ? If so, do you want to please or get rid of lobha and dosa ? ‘Do not follow the mind, do not go against the mind, just look at the mind.’ You don’t do things because you like them but because you are interested.

You have to even let go of your insight. In this practice your object is changing continuously, all the time, but awareness is continuous. No matter how fast objects arise and pass away, you can keep up with them. Effort is about being continuously watching the object with - out a break. Not focusing too hard, or harder. It is relaxed effort, not tense effort. Moment to moment continuous attention leads to Vipassan æ Jhænas . That leads to being able to see arising and passing away. Every moment there is something to learn. So pay attention to the moment. You start feeling bored when you judge the experience you’ve experienced. Just know, keep knowing what’s happening as it is. Why you want to come back to what you’ve been doing before? You have this expectation that what you’ve been doing was so good! If you feel tired look at that tiredness.

When meditating: • Don’t focus too hard • Don’t control • Don’t try to create something • Don’t force or restrict yourself • Don’t try to create anything • But don’t reject what is happening. But as things happen or stop happening, don’t forget. Be aware of them. Trying to create something is lobha (greed). Rejecting what is happening is dosa (aversion). Not knowing if something is happening or has stopped happening is moha (delusion). Only when the observing mind has no lobha , dosa , nor soka (worry-anxiety) inside it, then the meditating mind will arise. You have to double check to see what attitude you are meditating with. You have to accept and watch both good and bad experiences."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! You only want good experiences. You don’t want even the tiniest unpleasant experience. Is this fair? Is this the way of the Dhamma? Don’t have any expectations. Don’t want anything. Don’t be anxious. Because if these attitudes are in your mind, it’s difficult to meditate. Why are you focusing so hard when you meditate? You want something to stop happening? It is likely that one of these attitudes is there. Is the mind getting tired? Something is wrong with the way you are practising. You cannot practise when the mind is tense. If the mind and body are getting tired it is time to check the way you are meditating. Meditating is waiting and watching with awareness and comprehension-understanding. Not thinking, not reflecting, not judging. Don’t practise with a mind that wants something or wants something to happen. The only result will be that you will tire yourself."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  59 The meditating mind should be relaxed and at peace. Both the mind and the body should be comfortable. A light and free mind enables you to meditate well. Do you have the right attitude? Meditating is, whatever happens good or bad, accepting, relaxing and watching it. What is the mind doing? Thinking? Or being aware? Where is the mind now? Inside? Or outside? Is the watching-observing mind properly aware? Or only superficially aware? You are not trying to make things turn out the way you want it to happen. You are trying to know what is happening as it is. Don’t feel disturbed by the thinking mind.

Only when there is viriya , sati will become continuous. Only when sati is continuous, samædhi will become continuous. Only then samædhi is established, then you will know things as they really are. When you start to know things as they really are, saddh æ then increases further. Just pay attention to what is, exactly in the present moment. Don’t go back to the past! Don’t plan for the future!

So depending on where you are practising you might find you are doing the same thing using different technique. When you have wandering mind it’s not you, that’s the nature of the mind. Stop blaming it on your self. If you look at an object directly, the mind in order to know has to visualize the object and in visualizing, form always comes in. So concept is not lost. When you look at the mind and you know that the mind is not doing any kind of visualization then you know you are at real paramattha . Then you get to Dhammænupassan æ . Real paramattha then is Dhammænupassan æ . What is real paramattha ? Real paramattha has only its charac - teristics, when you see the object you see only its characteristics, the characteristics are changing, are impermanent. When you get to real paramattha you don’t know this is heat, cold, tension, fear, agitation, craving. You just know that this is the changing nature of the object. The object is just object, all objects become the same as well, because identification with heat is still identification. Because identification is just a sense of what it is and it is changing.

Because you know this object, object, object! Object has only one nature: Object . If you know that you are relaxed, that’s object. You can’t say that you don’t know of anything. So if you don’t think that you know of object you still know your state or mind. Later things won’t be subtle any longer, keep acknowledg - ing that awareness is still present. You can watch your wandering mind but don’t get involved. BE WITH WHAT EVER IS You don’t select objects, just be there and aware. You don’t try to experience past experiences. You don’t try to get anywhere. Don’t encourage thinking, encourage seeing. You develop sharper awareness if you watch closely the passing away. Real happiness is not wanting anything. Don’t lie down too long it makes you lose your sharpness. If you have to rest maintain some mindfulness, keep sharp alert, awake and balanced. Do not encourage sleeping.

Have no thoughts or words about what you are knowing. You already know. When meditating the mind is taking a rest from concepts. It gives no name to what is experiencing. It only knows what is hap - pening directly without any thoughts. It is necessary to look and know the state of the mind. Know what you can experience directly. There is no need to justify or stop what you are feeling. Don’t let memories affect you, or the present moment. If you want freedom from the process, (mind and body) you must see what the process is first. Do not depend on externals- material things for your peace of mind, depend only on your own mind. Do not think of thoughts or wandering mind as a distur - bance. That is just another object. It’s not worth it getting upset about anything at all! When you meditate it is important to keep your mind on par - amattha (movements, sensations of body and mind etc.) If you don’t, the mind can still become calm and concentrated but you cannot feel reality, you won’t be able to develop deep insight.

Attitude: even if you go to a relaxed place, don’t stop trying. Attachment: watch that mind that says, I know so much.

When you are meditating whatever is happening right now is your object of meditation. Be ready, be present, an object is always there. Do not expect what will happen next, do not try to create experience, or to make your meditation experience better, just be with whatever is happening completely.

In the evolution process we have learned to interpret things the right way. But to go to beyond ordinary reality you leave these things behind. Knowing your wandering mind is Cittænupassanæ but on a very gross level. Knowing what you are hearing, is not Cittænupassanæ it is just hearing. When you’ve been meditating for some time you don’t stop looking at the subtle object and not let the subtle object disap - pear. This takes more skill and strength from the mind but now you have that. So exert energy and keep going. In Burmese ‘meditate’ also means exert energy. So try a bit harder, wake up! The samædhi required to look at the gross object, and the samædhi required to look at the subtle object is not the same. By trying to stay with the subtle object the level of samædhi increases. And only when you look at more and more subtle objects, only when it gets very subtle, you get closer to paramattha . Before that, you are with lots of concepts yet. In daily activities practice, look and watch the mind, don’t follow it. Look into it, watch what its doing, what’s happening in the mind and don’t force anything. The mind always compares, you always like some dislike some, You don’t have to follow the mind.

When you see the object and the knowing mind arising and passing away together then you understand the watching mind, because it’s the watching mind that sees that . The watching mind is also a knowing mind, which appears when we want to observe the knowing mind. If the watching mind is not so interested in the object, it tends to fly away. Then wandering mind appears. Try to look at many objects and keep the momentum happen - ing so that wandering mind does not interfere. If the momentum slows down then patches of wandering mind will appear. • Eating : It is more important to note, than it is to eat. Watch the eye scanning the food table, watch the opening and closing of the mouth as food enters it. While eating, watch flavour, pay attention to your self, don’t go outside yourself.

So you’ve had your meal, being mindful of all your sensations, eating it, and then when you ask your self, ‘well what did I eat?’ You can’t remember! Or it takes you a while to recall!

You can remember the whole process that you ate but you can’t remember what you ate! With eating remember three things always: sensations, taste, mind states. You can include movements as well as intentions as you go on. When you get very relaxed even eating is very calming. When your mindfulness is lacking you tend to eat too fast! On the other hand when you are mindful it seems that it takes so much energy just to eat! Because you are so calm! It’s exhausting! And being aware of all your sensations, makes it feel so painful! Every moment something is coming through the five sense doors to the mind constantly. So you are aware of something. With all practices, try to have awareness of yourself every moment. If you really have awareness first, and awareness is first place and everything else comes second, then you will find really you start going up in the practice. The mind becomes obedient and tamed.

If you want to ‘get somewhere’ in meditation, some certain stage or experience, remember that the harder you try the harder it becomes.

When you think of sensation, like pulling or pressing, stretching, pushing, all that, has direction so don’t think of it like that. Just be aware of it. In the mind the arising of liking and disliking, impatience and wanting is amazing and constant. It is subtler than thoughts and images and mental states because of the feeling that accompanies them.

When you have wandering mind, just try to be aware of it, if you try to get rid of it, it’ll make you very tired. The burden of life is not so big; the burden of greed is bigger. Greed is limitless. Never look-stay with the quietness and stillness because then you will really start going down. The reason you are losing it-slow - ing down, is because you don’t look at it clearly. Focus on it clearly. Just keep noting your main object focusing on it clearly. The moment you start knowing that your mind is becoming quiet put in more energy immediately.

One wants to be in a certain way, adopts a ‘teacher’ persona, starts looking down on others and feeling ‘one step above’, ‘every - one depends on me’, ‘I have to be treated in such and such a way’, ‘everyone has to do exactly as I say’ and so on.

After you have watched your mind for years, you get to know it so well, recognize it so clearly; how stupid, tricky, jealous, fool - ish, covetous, bossy, overpowering, and controlling it can be and because you can be aware of it, it cannot carry you away."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"c i t t æ n u p a s s a n æ  79 We cannot afford to be careless, always try to be very careful and use your sati as your compass . The mindful mind will always warn you when you are getting into trouble. No control, just simple bare awareness of mind. Can you hear the chattering, the monologue or dialogue going on in the mind, the comments, the judgements and so on. The mind is always tricky and craves for something, but is that what you really want to do? Run all day slaving for the mind? Just because many other people are running mindlessly after all kinds of stimulation? Watch how the mind creates its own problems. Most of our problems are mind made. Most problems will disappear just by the understanding of the mind. The present phenomenon is the only thing I have whether I like it or not. So it is more important for me. Having little distraction we can observe things easily. When you will become quite mindful you will know how to live your life. You will know what to do in any situation. Looking for satisfaction is looking for pain. Understanding this deeply we learn to let go. See how much you hurry yourself when you are upset. Be mindful. See anger as anger, not ‘my anger’. If you are upset because you enjoy music you are too demand - ing, you are asking and expecting too much of yourself. But if you see the enjoying mind and watch it with equanimity then only you will see it for what it is. Being upset which is a kind of aversion, is a close companion to greed and pride. Because you think: ‘I am a meditator so there shouldn’t be greed and pride arising in my mind’."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"80  the nibbæna aspirer’s guide to the mind! But you should be thinking: ‘Now is a good chance for me to study and examine them!’ A stream enterer still has greed and anger. But he has no iden - tification with mind and body. Only fully enlightened ones are free of greed and anger. Only the Arahat is free from comparing oneself with others. Meditate also when you are restless when you think it’s impos - sible for you to meditate because your mind is crazy. That is the most important time for you to meditate . The Buddha said: ‘When the mind is restless he or she knows that the mind is restless’. You are not expected to do more than that. You don’t feel guilty because there is anger or greed, etc. You know anger or greed are happening, you don’t deceive your self. That’s all you can do. So just be mindful, don’t beat up your self ! About consciousness-awareness-knowing, remember and observe these things always: The arising and passing away of consciousness. That every mind that arises is another and new mind. Consciousness arises because of the object and passes away because of the object. It is consciousness that sees hears, smells, tastes, touches, and thinks, not or me or mine. It is consciousness, the mind, which experiences all sense objects. When you are not mindful you get gaps of knowing. Understanding comes to those who are not in a hurry to understand.

Only when you see clearly where you are stuck, there is a chance that you might become unstuck. People behave like they are doing something and as if they know what they are doing. Do they really know what they are doing? You may stop thinking for a while just how important you are! Life is very short. There are things to be done. Only deep understanding of attachment can free the mind from it. If you force your mind to let go of attachment without really seeing the nature of it, attachment will come back very soon. The practice is being with whatever is there, regardless of speed and quantity of objects. The pace might be fast, medium or slow, even still, just some or many objects.

It’s all part of it. Relax ! This is the cool practice. No tension, check attitude, expecta - tions, lobha . Do not react in practice, or outside it ! Keep your mindfulness no matter what the problem. Keep that beauty of the heart ! If you want to get a good result in meditation don’t be in a hu rry. This ‘being in a hurry’ makes the mind agitated. Sometimes when you enjoy something you are not attached to it. That’s a kind of freedom. Enjoying something without being attached, without being greedy. As long as you are not lost in thought you are meditating, being here and now. Don’t think and run around too much. Save your energy. How is your meditation these days?

Understanding of life and understanding of Dhamma go together. First of all learn to live your daily life mindfully, sanely. Do you understand wholesome and unwholesome states of mind? This is most fundamental in the practice, really seeing them immediately and by seeing the difference of quality of mind whether they are wholesome or unwholesome. Let it happen and watch. Don’t interfere just be aware. When citta becomes very subtle, easy to lose, or difficult to find and follow, just stay with one thing until things improve. Don’t try hard to follow or strain. If you give, with expectations of getting something back then you get back small. If you don’t expect nothing back but you are happy to give, then you get back big. Just big heart, and you do get a lot back. ‘The whole world is in flames’ says the Buddha. By what fire is it kindled? It is kindled by the fire of greed, hatred and ignorance. By the fire of birth, old age, pain, lamentation, sorrow grief and despair. It is not enough just to read an idea or just listen to an idea. It is very important to live it.

You can stay with it as long as you like. Listening mindfully, is not just concentrating on the talk, and trying not to miss anything but being aware of that too. Reading and writing is pretty much the same. ‘Keep the finger on the big one.’ ‘Keep the finger on the big one’ means: Know where your mind is and what it is doing. Starting out small: Observe obvious objects and continuously. If an emotion appears watch that emotion then go on. If it is hard to observe one object, start observing more. If observing many objects is hard, observe just one stable object. Be always mindful of something. Mindfulness: Keep the mind only on what you are doing.

So you have to be more mindful then. When you can practise outside as well as you practice inside the monastery then you know that your practice is good. Even in the midst of crowded noisy places you can stay calm, in touch with your mind. The watching of the mind becomes a strong habit. Note your feelings too. Are you feeling isolated, lonely, is that wisdom, is that kilesa ? When you are out always watch kilesa arising. Stay close to yourself. When people talk to you speak slowly and mindfully so that they slow down too. It takes a greater effort, so try relentlessly. Keep to yourself as much as you can especially when it’s difficult.

When you go out the mind starts partying: ‘I’m going to break free now!’ It tells you: ‘Okay, just a little of a much needed break’! And out it goes for the whole trip! You might find it ‘being cold.’ Just keep up your viriya / effort, keep trying again and again. You are not meditating in order to calm down the mind but to observe it. To look and see why is the mind like this now and how was it different before. So that wisdom arises from this watching. You get to know what’s happening in the mind. In sitting meditation don’t worry about if the objects are very clear or not. Watch the mind follow the awareness. Of course, it is better if the objects are clear, but that will follow later. The kilesa when they know that you are meditating, they stay away from you. They say: Okay, meditate now! But when you don’t, they come and attack you when you least expect it!

When you are dying your body has no control, it’s the mind that stays mindful. Sitting on a chair and lying meditation is good exercise for viriya because you have to apply more viriya without the support and aid of posture, but you must not keep falling asleep! When you are not doing sitting meditation, and you don’t have the support of the posture but instead you are sitting on a chair or lying down, the mind relaxes and you need to try mentally harder to keep your mindfulness. If your viriya is really strong, no matter how your posture is, it doesn’t matter. You can be upside down! Keep kilesa noted regularly, don’t let it accumulate. Keep relaxed, check for tension now and then, check your emotions. Are they involved? Are you in control? Don’t panic if you are not, just relax and get in touch. The Buddha is not the statues and images in the pagodas that people go and visit all day long. The true Buddha is inside you.

When one is perfectly aware of the incessant arising and passing away of phe - nomena of experience — just going their own and natural way — but consciousness that would normally arise and pass away with them is not there. But instead it stands still and separates from phenomena while they arise and perish very swiftly, separately and at a distance. Just foreign matter, not belonging anywhere. And the awareness that knows and sees all that is not caused or supported in any way by these objects or anything else. But it’s unconditioned. An awareness, beyond arising and passing away ! At that moment a totally undeniable understanding arises. That the process of arising and ceasing of phenomena which car - ries with it — which is — all defilements, unawareness, thinking processes, delusion, neuroses and all suffering that held us prison - ers and tortured us for so long, is not in any way ours, me or mine, self or part of self.

And that gives rise to a totally unprecedented sensation to arise. Totally inexpressible, nameless and certainly not of this world. Felt in the beginning for an instant as the touch of a tiny dot in the middle of the abdomen and disappearing; then gradually expanding from that spot and taking over the whole body, a sen - sation appears which simply leaves one without any doubt that this is nothing else but a taste of Nibbæna ! Nothing that we have experienced — or even dreamed of before — naturally or artificially or through meditation practice, like crude or refined rapture, calm, bliss — or if we combine all these together and then add anything else we can imagine to it, in terms of pleasantness of all kinds and even intensify them — can amount to anything other than painful piles of excrement com - pared to this extraordinary experience.

Their fleeting, suffering and impersonal kind of nature is what makes that separation from them the most liberating and happiest event there is. Somewhere round this time if not earlier a silent, and pure mind will arise and make itself evident. Don’t overlook that mind. Cultivate and take good care of it. Without forcing anything stay with that mind and observe its characteristics. What’s it conditioned by ? ! What’s it created by ? ! We must not force this mind to be. It cannot be forced or con - trolled. If you try to force it — by suppressing thinking for example — tension will arise and later manifest as breathing problems. We can only practise patiently until it reveals itself to us. This mind is never a created, never an achieved state. It’s always a natural state. Effortless and ever-present.

For all those who ask, who or what makes it to Nibbæna, I hope that this gives some idea about how to approach their question. So where does this unconditioned freedom come from? Is it the product of morality, concentration and mindfulness or hal - lucination? The Satipa¥¥hæna practice is certainly the path that leads to it. But it’s not something ‘out there’. But rather somewhere deeper and lying dormant in each and every being and never external to us. The deathless within. Our true nature. When it is not obscured by delusion and defilements, and everyone can experience it. Nibbæna is not separate from us for one instant ! So this is why we practise. To reach the end of suffering, real freedom, and it certainly is well worth it.

There’s a special kind of peace, aloofness a great sense of relief and happiness which are always there. Indifferent to the worldly and out of reach of the worldly. Like a huge safety net that will always catch you if you fall ! Suffering is a lot more bearable and renewed interest, zeal, and faith in the practice arise now as well as equanimity, and the Path still carries on. Obviously there is a long way before the end of the road and a lot more space for realizing. From time to time some quite remark - able experiences occur, but above all now we are at Home. And no longer anxious seeking and searching. Then a time comes when the understanding of one’s own mind to a certain degree has some very important things to reveal. Again in an abrupt way, a separation occurs between phe - nomena of experience and awareness allowing for a clear seeing into the nature of the mind. And what we see, to our astonish - ment is that... suffering does not exist ! But it’s created by the mind. The mind creates its own suffering ! And once we are able to catch the mind red handed and on the act, doing that, we are automatically free from that suffering ! Again words cannot say it, and cannot explain it.

Now the suffering maker has been seen and we simply cannot be fooled by that stunt any more. The mind cannot make us suffer any longer. At this point the mind changes again and transforms irrevers - ibly. This is true liberation through wisdom !  * An amazingly blissful floating feeling of equanimity follows this insight which lasts for two, three days or more, during which the mind automatically catches and rejects all attempts of the ‘creating mind’ to inflict suffering. Although these attempts are only few. As the mind remains equanimous silent and peaceful by itself throughout the day. After that the feeling subsides but the knowledge remains, and every time the mind gets a chance to inflict suffering due to fleeting unawareness, we know, and as soon as we know the mind lets go, and that’s the end of it. So this is permanent, the mind cannot go back to what it was like before. In that respect the mind is not our master any more but its become the mastered !
