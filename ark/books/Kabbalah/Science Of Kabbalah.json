Now, for the first time in the his- tory of the Western World, readers of the English language and seri- ous students of Kabbalah have the opportunity to learn the Wisdom of Kabbalah from the 20 th Century's greatest Kabbalist, Baal HaSulam. In this text,* the student will find a systematic, graduated exposition of Kabbalah unlike any treatment found in other available texts. This text comes with a brilliant commentary by Michael Laitman, a scientist and Kabbalist who received the Tradition from that illustrious chain that includes the Ari, Baal HaSulam, and his teacher, Rabash. \"The Wisdom of Kabbalah\" is an exhaustive text that the reader will certainly make a steady companion in his exploration of the Upper Worlds for many years to come.

One of the greatest Kab- balists of all times, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Alevi Ashlag, wrote it as one of the introductions to The Book of Zohar. Without the comprehension of this article, it is impossible to understand correctly a word in The Book of Zohar. Without this book, one cannot succeed in Kabbalah. It is the key to all Kabbalistic literature: to “The Study of the Ten Sefirot” , the prin- cipal modern Kabbalistic textbook, to the Book of Zohar, to the books of the great Ari. It is the key to the door that leads from our world to the spiritual world. For a long time, I could not begin its translation and commentar- ies. My second book was an attempt to show the basic structure of the universe. It was published in 1983. In recent times, it has become very urgent to publish a textbook in English on the birth, basic structure, and correction of the worlds and souls. It is hard and \"clumsy\" to describe Kabbalistic terms in translation, to relate Kabbalistic notions in another language.

To be honest, I had to receive my Teacher’s permission. My Teach- er is Rabbi Baruch Shalom Alevi Ashlag - Baal HaSulam’s eldest son and the last Kabbalist of past generations. The period of the Descending Upper Wisdom stopped with him, and a new personal, group period of apprehending the creation has begun; it is the last stage of correction and its obvious manifestation. I spent 12 years with my Teacher and he instructed me to continue the great mission of spreading Kabbalah in the world. I called my Kab- balistic School Bnei Baruch, in his honor. This school is open to anyone who really wants to study and devote himself to the ascent to the Upper worlds. The material of the book was tape-recorded during my studies with beginners. It was typed, translated from Hebrew, proofread, edited, and prepared for publishing by dozens of my students. I am very glad that they participated in the publishing of this and other books, since those who circulate Kabbalah receive spiritual reward from above, i.e., advancement. The book contains the original (Hebrew) text of the article “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah” by Rabbi Y. Ashlag and its translation ( in italics ), supplemented by my commentaries (in regular print). Drawings of every spiritual process were specially made for this book.

All that is cre- ated in the world is for man’s sake and everything lives and develops because of man.” It is necessary to understand: Is man not content with this world and everything that is in it, existing to serve and develop him, that he desires the Upper worlds too? The Torah is a Kabbalistic book. It was written by the greatest Kab- balist Moses. The Book of Zohar is a Kabbalistic commentary for the THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTICLE “ THE PREAMBLE TO THE WISDOM OF KABBALAH”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 16 Torah. The Book of Zohar, as well as the Torah, is divided into 5 books and weekly chapters. One of the weekly chapters is entitled “ Tazriya” . It is said: “The Creator created man with a full name. And every- thing that is created is absolutely perfect; everything is found in it.” From the above statement, we see that all worlds, the Upper, and the lower, every- thing that fills and animates them, all except the Creator, is inside man. חכמת כל את לפנינו כאן להביא צריך הייתי מילואו על הזה הענין להסביר בכדי והנה ( ב בפנים לפניך יתבאר הדברים פתיחת את להבין המספיק בשיעור כלל בדרך אמנם , הקבלה ודאי והנה . כנודע לנבראיו להנות כדי היתה בבריאה ת \" השי כוונת כי , הוא והתמצית . הספר ויצאו נמשכו תיכף הנה , טוב מכל ולהנותם הנשמות את לברוא במחשבה שעלה שבעת , הוא המחשבה ' ית אצלו כי , להנותם שחשב התענוגים של גבהם ובכל וקומתם צביונם בכל מלפניו אחר צמצום העולמות ברא למה לשאול יש ז \" ולפי . כמונו מעשה לכלי צריך ואינו גומרת לבדה . ז \" העוה של העכורים בהגופין הנשמות והלביש העכור ז \" לעוה עד צמצום 2) In order to explain the above, one would need to expound the entire wisdom of Kabbalah. Through further studying, the meaning of these statements will be revealed at a later stage. The point is that the Creator’s intention is to bestow delight. The moment the Creator thought to create souls and delight them, they instantly appeared before Him in their perfection and exaltedness. They were filled with infinite pleasure, which the Creator thought to bestow upon them. His thought alone completed the entire Creation and required no physical actions. A question arises accordingly: Why did He create worlds, restriction upon restriction, down to our relatively tiny world, and then place the souls - the created beings - into the insignificant bodies of this world? If the Creator is omnipotent, why did He not provide man with everything necessary? Why did He not allow each of us to do something of our own will? If desire alone were enough – each of us would have created a much better world than this. Why then did the Creator do it all this way?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 17 If we are suffering now in whatever manner to reap the benefit in the future – it also points to imperfection. ויש (' א ענף ח \" ע ) פעולותיו שלמות לאור להוציא כדי שהוא ח \" בע איתא זה על והתשובה ( ג להשלימם צריכים שיהיו עד שלמות בלתי פעולות יצאו שמהשלם זה אפשר איך להבין אמנם , כלי ובחינת אור בחינת בהנשמות להבחין יש כי הוא והענין . הזה שבעולם ומעשה פועל י \" ע האור הוא ולענגם להנותם ' ית שחשב השפע וכל , שבהם הכלי הוא שנבראו הנשמות עצם כי , הנאתו לקבל רצון בבחינת בהכרח אותם עשה הרי להנותם ' ית שחשב מאחר כי . שבהם ההוא לקבל שהרצון ותדע . והתענוג ההנאה יגדל כן השפע את לקבל הרצון מידת לפי שהרי של כלי לבחינת ונבחן , מאין יש ויציאת התחדשות מבחינה הנשמה של עצמותה כל הוא . מעצמותו מיש יש הנמשך הנשמה של אור לבחינת נבחן והשפע ההנאה ' ובחי . הנשמה 3) The answer is in the Ari’s book “The Tree of Life”. “...It is created by Him so as to demonstrate the perfection of His actions”. However, we need to understand: how could such imperfect action emanate from the perfect Creator? Moreover, the created beings must correct and spiritually elevate themselves through actions in this world. Why did He create such a seemingly low world with imperfect bod- ies and put infinite souls in them? Was it done so that afterwards they might discover what perfection means? That is to say, the Creator created the most insignificant world and the most insignificant man, whereas man himself has to sweat in order to achieve perfection. Is this the aim and perfection of the Creator’s actions? The fact is that two parts should be distinguished in the souls: the light and the vessel. The essence of the soul is its vessel (Kli), and the abundance with which the Creator thought to delight the souls is the light (Ohr), which fills the vessel. Since the Creator thought to bestow pleasure upon the souls, He was bound to fashion it in the form of a desire to receive delight. The size of the desire to receive pleasure determines the amount of pleasure received. You should know that the desire to receive pleasure is the essence of the soul. It is created from nothing, and is called “Kli”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 18 – the soul’s vessel. The abundance and delight that fill the vessel are defined as the light of the soul, emanating from the Creator. This light spreads out from the Creator. Only the desire ( the Kli ), the vessel, was created. The light emanates from the Creator Himself as pleasure and fills the vessel. In other words, the primary goal was to bestow, the secondary – to create someone who would desire to receive pleasure. Overall, there are two components in the creation: 1. The vessel – the desire to receive pleasure, the soul, Adam HaRishon , creation. 2. The delight that emanated from the Creator. ליש הנבחן שהוא מקודם היה שלא מה דבר התחדשות פירושו בריאה כי . הדברים ביאור ( ד וכן , יחד וכוללם יכול כל הלא .' ית בו כלול שאינו מה דבר שיהיה זה נצייר איך אמנם , מאין הכלים בחינת אלא אינו ' ית שברא הבריאה כל כלל אשר ובאמור . בו שאין מה נותן לך אין מהרצון ו \" ח כלול שאינו הוא הכרח שהרי , היטב זה מובן , לקבל הרצון שהוא הנשמות של כ \" וע , לכן מקודם ממנו זכר אף היה שלא ממש חדשה בריאה הוא כ \" וא . יקבל ממי כי לקבל . מאין ליש נבחן 4) Creation is something that did not exist before, i.e., something born out of nothing. Yet, how can we imagine something non-existent in the Creator? He must include absolutely everything. It is said that the entire creation is no more than a vessel (a Kli) of the soul, a desire to receive pleasure. So it is quite clear that such a desire is absent in the Creator. Hence, the desire to receive is a totally new creation, non-existent before, and is defined as born out of nothing. We cannot imagine what “nothing” is. Everything that exists in our world has its prehistory, its previous form; it is born out of something. For example, solid matter is formed out of gas. What does it mean to be formed out of nothing? We are unable to understand it. Afterwards, while apprehending spirituality, we will become participants in the com- prehension of this process."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 19 , הצורה ובשינוי הצורה בהשואת אלא אינו ברוחניים הנוהג ופירוד שהחיבור , לדעת ויש ( ה מה אין שהרי . שנים ולא אחד והם יחד מחוברים הם הרי אחת בצורה הם רוחניים ' ב אם כי לפי וכן . לזה מזה צורה שינוי בהמצא זולת לשנים להבחינם אפשר ואי , מזה זה שיבדילם נמצאים הם שאם עד , מזה זה התרחקותם שיעור כן ביניהם הצורה השתנות של גודלה מדת המרחק בתכלית דהיינו , ממערב מזרח כרחוק רחוקים נבחנים אז מזה זה הצורה בהפכיות . בהמציאות לנו המצוייר 5) One should know that, in spirituality, closeness and remoteness are determined by equivalence (similarity) or distinction of properties. If two spiritual objects have the same form, i.e. the same properties, they are bound together constituting a single whole. If there is no distinction between the two objects, they cannot be divided into two. The division is possible only if a difference between their properties is found. The degree of distinction in their properties will determine the dis- tance between them. If all the properties of two spiritual objects are opposite, then they are infinitely remote from each other, i.e., in a state of absolute remoteness. In our world, when we say one object resembles another, it means they both exist, but are identical. In the spiritual world, this is impossi- ble. Everything in it differs by the distinction of their properties. If there is no distinction, the two objects merge and form one. If there is a partial similarity of properties, then they merge in their common properties as two overlapping circles. A segment of one circle overlaps with a segment of the other, thus forming a common area. In the spiritual world, there are two properties: (i) “to receive pleasure” and (ii) “to bestow pleasure”. There is nothing except these two. If we juxta- pose one with the other, we will see they are completely opposite and have no point of contact between them. However, if the property “to receive” is changed into the property “to bestow”, i.e., the creation and the Creator will have some common desires, then they will move closer and bond with one another in these properties. The rest of their opposing desires will stay remote. Initially creation was created as absolutely opposite to the Creator."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 20 . מלה או הגה שום ו \" ח בו לנו ואין , וכלל כלל ביה תפיסא מחשבה לית ' ית בהבורא והנה ( ו ברא שהרי , להשפיע רצון ' בבחי שהוא ,' ית בו להבין לנו יש , הכרנוך ממעשיך מבחינת אמנם הפכיות בבחינת הנשמות נמצאים ז \" ולפי .' ית מטובו לנו ולהשפיע , לנבראיו להנות בכדי הכל נטבעו והנשמות , משהו לקבל רצון ו \" ח בו ואין להשפיע רק כולו הוא שהרי ' ית אליו הצורה נשארים הנשמות היו אם ונמצא . מזו רחוקה הצורה הפכיות שאין , ל \" כנ , לעצמם לקבל ברצון . עד לעולמי ו \" ח ' ית ממנו נפרדים נשארים היו , לקבל הרצון בבחינת בפועל 6) Human thought is unable to grasp the infinite Creator’s perfec- tion. There is no way to express or describe Him. However, by feeling His influence, we can understand that He desires to bestow delight upon us, for his only goal is to give us pleasure, fill us with bliss. The souls’ properties are absolutely opposite to those of the Cre- ator. Whereas He is a giver with no trace of the desire to receive in Him, souls were created with only the desire to receive delight. Hence, there is no greater antithesis of properties and remoteness from each other than this. Therefore, had the souls remained in their egoistical desire to receive pleasure, they would have been forever separated from the Creator. No words of our language may describe Him, for we are separated from Him by our properties, and cannot feel Him. It is worth pointing out here that this Introduction was written by a man, the Baal HaSulam, who had grasped it all in himself. He says he felt the Creator and His actions, saw His absolute kindness. At our level of understanding, we are yet unable to feel it. Why is it not enough just to desire delight in order to receive it? Why do I have to approach near to the Creator, make my properties equal to His, merge with Him completely? Why could He not create such a state where the creation would, on the one hand, would receive plea- sure, and on the other, bestow pleasure as does the Creator? In fact, then the Final Correction would come immediately, creation would merge with the Creator, being filled with His light, becoming equal to Him. Why do we have to accomplish this entire evolutionary process in our senses, perceive each desire as egoistical and opposite to the Creator;"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 21 then correct it, make it altruistic, similar to Him? Why do we have to feel how we approach Him, merge with Him? What do we gain from it?

The creation of all the worlds is a consequence of the Creator’s perfection in all His actions. However, if He had not revealed His powers in the actions He is performing on created beings, He would not have been called “perfect”. Nonetheless, it is still not clear how imperfect deeds could come out of the perfect Creator? Moreover, the Creator’s actions are so imperfect that they need to be corrected by man. It is clear from the above statements that creation is a desire to receive pleasure. Although it is quite imperfect due to its being completely opposite to and infinitely remote from the Creator, it is nonetheless this specially created property of “reception” that is necessary for Creation to receive the Creator’s delight. Here arises a question: “What did the Creator create every- thing for?” A Kabbalist who speaks only out of what he has attained asserts that He created us to bestow His delight upon us."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 22 For example, say that I come to visit a person and see before me a magnificent palace. The host comes out to meet me saying: “I have wait- ed for you all my life. Come and see what I have prepared for you.” Then he begins to display all the delicacies and offer them to me. I ask him: - Why are you doing all this? - I am doing it to delight you. - What is in it for you if I am delighted? - I need nothing but to see you delighted. - How can it be that you do not need anything? - You have the desire to receive pleasure and I do not. Therefore, my delight is in giving pleasure to you. On the finite human level, we cannot understand what it means to give without receiving anything in return. This property is absolutely opposite to our nature. Hence, it is said: “Only in my sensations can I know Him.” Above it, I am unable to grasp. I have no way of knowing if the host has some secret idea or intention. If the Creator has intentions as regards us, but does not reveal them, we are unable to know them. Each of us being created as a vessel can under- stand only what enters it. That is what fills our hearts and minds. When we develop our vessels to the maximum, we will receive in them everything that emanates from the Creator. Then we will feel that He is absolutely kind and has no thoughts other than to bestow delight upon man. There are the so-called 7 th , 8 th , 9 th and 10 th millennia, after the 6 th millennium – the 6 thousand levels of the Creation’s attainment of the Creator. It reveals His thoughts, merges with Him so completely that no questions remain. It is not because the vessel is filled, but because the Creator allows the vessel inside of Himself. This equivalence of form can be achieved in two ways. Either we improve our properties or the Creator will worsen His. The correction of souls occurs when the Creator descends to their level by worsening His properties and merging with them; He then starts to improve His"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 23 properties, simultaneously improving those of the souls, as if pulling them out of their taint. For example, a teacher joins a group of youngsters, pretending to be as frivolous as they are; he starts to liken his properties to theirs, and then, by improving himself, begins to make them a little better. In this way he corrects them, elevates them from their low level towards the light of the true intelligence. Therefore, there needs to be an initial worsening of the Creator’s properties in order to become equal with the creation, followed by the improvement and subsequent correction of the created souls. This process depends on the Creator; it is carried out by Him and therefore is defined as “the Creator’s work” ( Avodat Hashem therefore is defined as “the Creator’s work” ( A v odat Hashem therefore is defined as “the Creator’s work” ( ). However, man must be willing to go through this process if he wants the Creator to change him. Hence, he has to prepare himself and have the strength and understanding to justify the Creator’s work. Such a person is called “a righteous man”, for he is able to justify the Creator’s actions. The desires to receive and to bestow constitute two opposite moral and spiritual vectors, intentions. One is directed inwardly, the other is directed outwardly. However, the fact is that later, in the process of the evolution of creation, these desires take many different forms. Each Sefira and Partzuf represents different kinds of desires. We Partzuf r epr esents dif f er ent kinds of desir es. W e Partzuf study desires in their “pure” form, but in fact, a Kabbalist who grasps them, feels them as much more complex. However, the desire to receive pleasure is always at the heart of creation, whereas the desire to bestow is at the heart of the Creator’s influence upon created beings. Outwardly, the Creator may act as if He desires to receive, as is il- lustrated by the Baal HaSulam’s example of the host and the guest. This example includes all elements of our relations. The host says, “I prepared it all for you; chose only the things you like. I will be delighted to watch you eat. Can you not give me that pleasure?” Thus, he can make the guest sit down and eat. After such persuasion, the guest feels he is obliged to"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 24 eat and enjoy the meal. Otherwise, how would the guest reciprocate with the host for all his efforts? However, the guest has a different problem; whatever he does, the desire to receive pleasure is constantly “burning” inside him. That is how he is created, and there is no getting away from it. He can only enjoy what he receives. How can he give? By receiving: to give for the sake of receiving. As a result, his act of giving is nothing more than a means to receive what he desires. According to my nature, I can receive both in action and in inten- tion. My action may be giving or receiving, but my goal is the same – to re- ceive pleasure. Man unknowingly seeks delight; it is our natural desire. In other words, the essence of my action depends solely on my intentions. With the help of intention, I can reverse the essence of my action. I can receive by giving as in the example of the host and the guest. In any case, I can only receive; I am unable to give anything. With the help of intention, I can only receive, either “for my own sake” or “for someone else’s”. Therefore, the relations between the Creator and man may take in- numerable forms. They change on each level of man’s spiritual growth. The Creator changes with regard to us through a system of His conceal- ments, demonstrating one of His properties at a time in accordance with our ability to be equal to Him. If the Creator shows us His genuine, absolutely perfect properties, the way He is, we will not be able to become equal to Him. That is why he diminishes, coarsens, and rather adapts Himself to us. We only have to rise onto this tiny level, become similar to the Creator in one little property. As soon as we do that, the Creator starts revealing Himself in this property on a slightly higher level, and in other properties too. Through a system of worlds, He conceals His perfection, allowing us to liken our- selves to Him and ascend spiritually."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 25 “Olam Hazeh” (“our world”) is man’s inner sensation of being in a state of absolute egoism. It is in this state that man feels that there is a Creator Who is extremely remote and completely hidden from him. In view of his created properties, man is totally opposite to the Cre- ator and spiritually distant from Him. Such an inner sensation is called “Olam Hazeh .” One may sit in his room and simultaneously be in “Olam Hazeh”, or in the worlds of Assiya, Yetzira, Beria, or in the worlds of Assiy a, Y e tzir a, Beria, or in the worlds of and Atzilut – man’s inner states that link him to the spiritual levels. The Creator is in a constant state of absolute calm. What does this mean? The Host, havingfound out what you like most, prepared a special meal, and is waiting for you. When you come to Him, He persuades you to accept his treat. In spite of all these actions, we still say the Creator is in a state of absolute calm, since His intention “to bestow upon cre- ation” is invariable. By absolute calm, we mean a constant unchanging desire. It exists only in the Creator, in all His deeds. These deeds are countless, infinite and vast. Since all these variations of deeds remain unchanged and seek only after one goal, we define them as a state of absolute calm. Here we see no movement, since there is no change. Yet how shall we give for the sake of receiving pleasure? In our world, we are constantly doing it. For example, somebody brought me a cup of tea. Why did he do that? Because he enjoyed doing it, otherwise he would not have done it. Our action of giving or receiving does not matter at all. Mechanical action does not determine anything. Everything is determined only by the intention. There are four combinations of an intention and action: - reception for the sake of reception; - giving for the sake of reception; - giving for the sake of giving; - reception for the sake of giving."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 26 The first two combinations, “action-intention”, exist in our world. The third and the fourth exist in the spiritual world. If man can achieve such an intention, it means he is in the spiritual world. Spirituality be- gins when one gives in order to please. This is something we do not understand; giving for the sake of pleasing. Where am I here? I am “cut off” from my ego, from my desire to receive. I give something and please somebody without receiving anything in return... Can this be possible? Then there is also “reception for the sake of giving”. When we study it in the spiritual objects - Galgalta , AB , SAG – it seems quite sim- ple. Actually, we are unable to imagine such a phenomenon in our life. The fact is that to receive pleasure through giving is not forbid- den. However, bestowal must be purely spiritual, without a trace of 'for one’s own sake'. First, man makes a Tzimtzum (a restriction), “ascends” to such a spiritual level, and acquires a quality of complete disregard for his own needs. Only then can he bestow and be delighted, receive pleasure through giving, i.e., the delight he feels is not as a result of his bestowal, but a consequence of someone enjoying his act. Tzimtzum Aleph (The First Restriction) is not just an action performed Tzimtzum Aleph ( T h e F i r s t R e s t r i c t i o n ) i s n o t j u s t a n a c t i o n p e r f o r m e d Tzimtzum Aleph in the world of Infinity. If man is able to restrict himself and not think of his own benefit, he then starts to ascend, “to count” his spiritual levels. Movement is defined as a change of desire, or more accurately, the desire to which he can add his intention “for the sake of the Creator” and not “for his own sake”. If your desire is constant in size and direc- tion, you are considered to be motionless. Suppose you wish me well only in 20% of your intention. If your desire is only such, then you are absolutely motionless. If it changes with regard to me, then you are in motion. While climbing the spiritual levels, man is in constant motion with regard to the Creator. It also seems to man that, regarding himself, the Creator is constantly moving towards him. This is because as man rises to a higher level, the Creator's revelation of Himself to him increases,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 27 i.e., he sees that the Creator is more kind and wants to bestow upon him. In man’s sensations, the rapprochement is mutual. However, we say, “the Upper Light is absolutely motionless”, the Upper Light, not the one that comes upon him, i.e., the Creator’s inten- tion, not His light. We cannot feel the Upper Light until it enters the vessel. Inside the Kli we can feel the different varieties of light , and the way it affects us. However, the Creator, the Upper Light, is absolutely motionless, for His only unchanging desire is to bestow delight upon us. How do we know this? There are people who have ascended to such a high level, where they could fully grasp the Creator’s desire with regard to creation. They reached the level of the largest Kli and entirely filled it with the Creator’s light. They are unable to rise higher, but can see that everything that comes from the Creator to creation is absolute kindness. “From Thy deeds I will know Thee” – I cannot know the Creator’s thoughts; I can only verify that everything He does is meant for me, for my ultimate good, demonstrating His infinite kindness. Then I may say His attitude to me is absolutely kind. What is it to be absolutely kind? We do not mean He Himself, but rather His properties regarding me. The Creator Himself is incom- prehensible. If man in his Kli, be it the Baal HaSulam, the Ari or Rabbi Shimon, achieves The Final Correction ( Gmar Tikkun ) and receives from the Creator everything he can – he becomes the sole receiver! Perhaps he alone enjoys the Creator’s attitude and others do not. We see that in our world the Creator treats one better and another worse. How can we assert that He is absolutely kind to all? The fact is that, while climbing the spiritual levels, man absorbs all the vessels of all the souls, attaches all created souls to his. He absorbs their sufferings and performs their corrections. It is called “he who suffers with the whole world is rewarded by the whole world”. Man receives the light descending to all souls. Therefore, in his ultimate state, each Kabbalist is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 28 afforded such sensations as if he alone was created and he is Adam HaRis- hon . Hence, he knows and feels what the Creator does with each soul. We all exist in one perfect state, but do not feel so. Our sensations are unimproved and distorted; according to them, our state is imperfect. Our inner feelings are so unrefined that we nevertheless perceive our most blissful state as imperfect. Even now, we are in an absolutely perfect state. However, we are sent such thoughts and feelings that it seems to us that we are in a differ- ent, bad state, as it is said, “When we return to the Creator, we will see it was a dream”. Then we will realize that our sensations were totally unimproved, that we saw reality quite differently from what it really was at the time. We could not perceive it correctly, for our senses were incorrectly tuned. In fact, all souls are in a perfect state. No bad state was ever created by the Creator. He created a perfect soul that is in full confluence with Him. It is completely filled with the light and is delighted by His great- ness and power. Why then do other states exist? Because there is no way we can presently feel this perfection. Why are all worlds inside us? For unless we correct these concealments and distortions inside, we will not be able to sense where we really are. Actually, we are in there and feel it, but not in our present state. A Kabbalist in this world is constantly performing corrections. He suffers and worries while making these corrections in himself. Further, there are special souls in our world that take upon themselves the general correc- tions of the entire world, thus “pulling” it towards the universal good. Even in our most “lifeless” states, we go through tremendous changes. We cannot feel them. Oftentimes, a day flashes by like one mo- ment, but at other times drags on for eternity... Question: “What does it mean when the Partzuf receives the light Partzuf r eceiv es the light Partzuf and then expels it?”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 29 In our world, it is impossible to return what was already received inside. Nevertheless, as we speak about spirituality, we mean sensations. Imagine feeling wonderful, then wretched, then wonderful again, and wretched again. This is in some way similar to receiving the light and expelling it. This example demonstrates the impossibility of juxtaposing spiritual actions with our material body. They are of a very different type. The Kli’s desire to acquire a screen and liken its properties to the Creator’s after the First Restriction is just one of a number of “external” corrections, so-called “attires”. The inner property, the desire to receive pleasure, remains unchanged in accordance with the spiritual law that holds: “desire remains unchanged”. In other words, the size of the cre- ated desire never changes. The Creator created the desire in absolute conformity to the light with which He wishes to fill creation. Neither the size of this desire, nor its quality, is subject to change. Only the creation’s intention during reception alters. Reception can be either “for the Creator’s sake” or “for one’s own sake”. There is a host, but I can neither see nor feel him; all that I see I use for my own sake. This state is called “our world”. Feeling the Creator and being able to push away what He offers me means that I have crossed the Machsom – a partition between the spiri- tual world and ours. I already have an intention not to use my egoism: desire remains and is by no means diminished, but its use was modified from “for one’s own sake” to “for the Creator’s sake”. First, I only restrain myself from receiving “for my own sake”; then I can correct my intention and make my screen so powerful that I will be able to use my egoism “for the Creator”, i.e., begin to receive “for His sake”. My spiritual level, my place in the spiritual worlds, depends on how much I can receive for His sake. If I can thus receive one fifth of the light destined for me, then I am in the world of Assiya ; if I can receive two fifths – I am in the world of Yetzira ; if I receive three fifths – I am in the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 30 world of Beria ; if I receive four fifths – I am in the world of Atzilut, and if I receive five fifths – I am in the world of Adam Kadmon . Once I am able to receive everything that emanates from the Creator, I return to Olam Ein Sof (the world of Infinity), i.e., the world of Unlimited Reception. Ein Sof ( t h e w o r l d o f I n f i n i t y ) , i . e . , t h e w o r l d o f U n l i m i t e d R e c e p t i o n . Ein Sof That was the world of Unlimited Reception without the screen, before Tzimtzum Aleph ( TA ). Now, I can also receive the light endlessly, but with the help of the screen. This state, which is so strikingly different from reception prior to TA, is called the Final Correction. There are no levels in the world of Infinity, although more and more new conditions for reception arise. We do not study the state of creation once it achieves the world of Infinity, since everything related to the state after the Final Correc- tion is called “ Sitrey Torah ” (secrets of the Torah). Everything related to the state before the Final Correction is called “ Ta’amey Torah ” (tastes of the Torah). Ta’amey Torah may and must be studied by all. Everyone is obliged to grasp them. They may be apprehended in two ways (more often in their combination): by “way of suffering” or by “way of the To- rah”; in any event, the result will be the same, differing only in time and sensation. All people will have to apprehend Ta’amey Torah, i.e., master Kabbalah - the science of attaining the light of Torah. Thus, as it was said above, the desire itself remains unchanged. It is only the screen that changes. In accordance with the screen's magnitude, I take only the part of my desire that I can use for the Creator’s sake. In any case, whatever part of my desire I may use, I always receive a certain part of the light in all my five levels of soul. Suppose there are five dishes on the table in front of me. I have to cut some layer off each dish, whereas “the thickness” of the layer would depend on the magnitude of my screen. I always have NaRaNHaY – five NaRaNHaY – f iv e NaRaNHaY lights-pleasures ( Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya, and Yechida ) felt in five parts of my desire to receive delight ( Keter, Hochma, Bina, Zeir Anpin, and Malchut )."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 31 If I received the light in one of my desires, it means that I received it in five parts of the desire (five Sefirot ) being on the same level of Aviut. It means that this reception of the light ( Partzuf ) emerged (was born) be- Partzuf ) emer ged (w as born) be- Partzuf cause of one Zivug de Haka’a (the screen interacting with the light). It is similar to ordering a set meal. There are various kinds worth $10, $20, $30, $100, and $1000, but each consists of five courses, since I always have a combination of five desires. This is how my desire to receive was originally designed. Similarly, I have five senses. Each dinner consists of my five desires, Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut; inside them, I receive the lights, Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya, and Yechida. The vessel and the light are common names, but the Partzufim have specific names. For example, Partzufim in the world of Adam Kadmon are called Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA, and BON , in the world of Atzilut – Atik, Arich Anpin, Abba ve Ima, ZON, etc. After the 'Fall', creation, the common soul, Adam HaRishon, split into thousands of souls. In the process of their correction, the souls as- cend and occupy certain places in the spiritual worlds. In order to give these levels brief and accurate names, they are called Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Beit HaMikdash (the Temple) , Cohen HaGadol (the High Priest), , Cohen HaGadol ( t h e H i g h P r i e s t ) , , Cohen HaGadol Sh- emesh (the Sun), emesh ( t h e S u n ) , emesh Yareach (the Moon). In correspondence with these levels Yareach ( t h e M o o n ) . I n c o r r e s p o n d e n c e w i t h t h e s e l e v e l s Yareach and states, names were given to the weekdays, Sabbaths, holidays, etc., de- pending on how the worlds and the souls in them ascend and descend. Now we can understand what the Torah really speaks about: it describes only spiritual reality – worlds, Partzufim, Sefirot and souls. For describing the souls and what happens to them, “the language of branch- es” taken from our world is used. Hence, you will not find Kabbalistic names like Keter, Hochma, Bina, Atik, and Arich Anpin in the Torah. More precise, specific names, designating a definite level or a part of it in a certain state, are applied. In such a case, this level would for example be called a place of rest in a desert or some action, etc."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 32 Regardless of ascents or descents of the world, the soul is always enveloped in some outer shell. At the moment, we call our shell “this world” or “our world”. If man works on himself and crosses the Mach- som, alongside this world he would feel another world, i.e., more outward forces, a greater manifestation of the Creator; man will distinctly see the light emanating from Him, establish a tangible contact with Him. Man reaches this or that level in accordance with the magnitude of the acquired screen, because each world and each level represent a filter: from the world of Infinity to our world, there are 125 levels, i.e., 125 filters between the world of Infinity and our world. I was completely filled with the light in the world of Infinity. In our world, I am totally deprived of the light, and can neither see nor feel it because all these filters conceal it from me. Supposedly, each filter con- ceals 125-th part of the light. Since there are five worlds, each containing five Partzufim , which in turn include five Sefirot , they total 5x5x5=125 levels. What is the meaning of these levels? As with glass, each of them restrains the light. For example, take a piece of red glass. Why is it red? It is because it restrains the color red. How can I prevent this level from restraining the light coming to me? It is very simple. I have to match the properties of that level. In other words, it restrains the light for me because I am not allowed to receive it. If it reaches me without being deferred by the filter, I will receive it “for myself”, since I have no screen for it. Therefore, my screen must be equal to the properties of that level’s filter, in which case I myself would be able to weaken the light. Thus, if I acquire a screen as powerful as this particular level, I match its properties and all its restrictions disappear for me; they cease to exist. Therefore, gradually, level by level, I abolish all these levels-filters until they all vanish and only the light remains. Such a state signifies attainment of the world of Infinity. It is endless and has no limitations, since I neutralized them all."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 33 When I reach a certain level, I begin to feel and grasp everything on it quite distinctly. I myself become the property of that level. Hence the Torah says, “Everyone has to be like Moses”, i.e., must rise to the lev- el reached by him, since in the spiritual worlds “Moses” is the name of a certain level, and anyone who reaches it is considered to be like Moses. Each time, man increases the magnitude of his screen according to the properties of the level before him. Any level above me is defined as the Creator; I cannot see anything beyond it since it is His manifesta- tion for me. Therefore, each time, I have to match my properties to the Creator in front of me. On each level, He is different, revealing Himself to me more and more. To what extent? Suppose a person might steal $1000 lying before him, but if there is only $100, he would not do so. It means that he already has a screen for $100, so this sum may be placed before him; he will be able to reject it, altruistically work with it. Therefore he is not af- fected by the ban “Do not steal” with regard to $100. If he is able to strengthen his screen and not to steal $1000, then this amount will not be a limitation for him, and it could be placed before him. Likewise, he must strengthen his screen before the infinite light that is destined to fill him “is placed” before him. When man is able to receive all this light for the Creator’s sake, he will experience a delight 625 greater than Malchut (creation) in the world of Infinity. Why will he receive more pleasure? Why was Malchut’s (soul’s) descent from the world of Infinity to our world necessary? For what pur- pose was the separation from the Creator and gradual return to Him? It was done so that, with the help of the freedom of choice, by will and power, he might achieve an elevated state like the world of Infinity. Be- ing in the world of Infinity was initially determined by the Creator, not by man. If he achieves this state by himself, he acquires his own new vessels, his own screen, his own sensations, earns his own eternity and perfection."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 34 The fact is that because of man’s independent efforts, he prepares himself for feeling what is really bestowed upon him in the world of In- finity. When Malchut of the world of Infinity was born by the Creator’s thought, received the light and later restricted itself from further recep- tion, it felt only a tiny part of it, for its vessel was not yet ready. As creation begins to ascend from a point totally opposite to the Creator, from complete darkness, when hunger and the desire to enjoy this light are gradually accumulated, creation consequently begins to be delighted with the same light, but the delight is already 625 times greater than before the beginning of correction. The light does not change; everything depends on hunger, on the desire to receive the light. If man is not hungry, he will not be able to enjoy even the best delicacies. If he is starving, even a crust of bread will become a source of tremendous pleasure. Thus everything depends on how strong the hunger is, not on the light. One can receive a scanty mea- sure of the light, but the vessel will have a huge pleasure in that. On the contrary, the light can fill everything around, but if the ves- sel feels no hunger, it will feel, out of all this light, only Ohr Nefesh , a very small light. The entire Universe and its control are designed exactly to prepare the Kli for receiving perfect delight; in other words, that it might really feel what the Creator bestows upon it. For that, it must move away, then gradually and independently draw nearer. “The language of branches” exists only in Hebrew, but it could be made on the basis of any other language. In other languages, the relation between the spiritual root and its consequences in our world cannot be traced. It does not exist even in Modern Hebrew. Nevertheless, if we take basic Hebrew with all its roots, then there is a clear connection between the root and the consequence. Such a connection exists in every language, but in other languages, no one has ever tried to find it. No Kabbalist is pointing out the con- nection between the spiritual and the material in Chinese hieroglyphs"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 35 or in Latin letters, etc. In Hebrew, thanks to Kabbalists, we know these correspondences, for example, why the letter “ Aleph ” is written this way and not another. What do we really express by it? We express human sensations. One can take the language of music, colors, or any other language. Everything that can be used to express human sensations, notions, comprehension, can be utilized as a language. It is possible to speak about spirituality in any language. Hebrew is unique in that it has a ready code. However, if there is a Kabbalist who knows the roots of any other language, he will be able to do the same with it. The forces standing behind Hebrew letters form combinations ex- pressed in a certain letterform. Hebrew is within the root of other lan- guages. Inscription of the letters in other languages actually come from the same root as the Hebrew letters. However, they are modified, so the connection between letters in other languages and their spiritual roots are different. When we comprehend a certain spiritual level or sensation, when we feel something in the spiritual world, we know what to call this sensa- tion. So what can be done if we have not yet comprehended the spiritual, when the sensations cannot be expressed in words, when we do not have an appropriate language? What should be done to find this language? In the spiritual world, there is no language, no worlds, and no let- ters; there is only the vessel’s sensation of the light. The fact is that every spiritual vessel has its branch in this world; everything descends from the world of Infinity downwards to our world. Then all the sensations of our world rise to the world of Infinity. Therefore, if we take any point in the world of Infinity, it is possible to trace a straight line passing through all the worlds down to our world, to its branch. Thus it is possible to say that the soul of Adam HaRishon , broken into 600 thousand parts, exists in each of the spiritual worlds. The ar- rangement of the spiritual worlds is absolutely identical. The difference"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 36 is only in the material from which they are built. In any world, the soul feels its condition, the influence on it, and its interaction with a certain spiritual level. If one takes the projection of this soul on our world, one will find in Hebrew the notions corresponding to spiritual conditions. Then we can take words from our world, assuming that with their help, we speak not about the objects of our world, but with the help of these words, we speak about the objects, forces, and actions in the spiritual world. Such complete correspondence is a result of our use of one and the same lan- guage. The difference is only in the plane of this or “that” world, where the intended notion exists. Our language is a description of objects, actions, sensations, reac- tions, interactions. Everything we have in our world exists in the spiritual one - the similar picture on all 5 levels. Hence, on each stage, on any of the 125 levels, regardless of where you are, you can always take our language and describe what is going on at that level. However, only someone who has already been on that level can really understand you. The one who has not yet been there will suppose that you are talking about our world, or the level he is on at the moment of reading or listening to your account. The Torah is written in the language of branches at the level of the world of Atzilut . However, unprepared people understand what is written in the Torah literally, thinking that it is talking about our world. They take it as a collection of stories. Thus, the language of branches describes spiritual actions that take place simultaneously on all levels. “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah” studies the birth, de- velopment, and arrangement of the worlds. When the Upper worlds spread down to the level of our world, the souls begin to rise from our world to the world of Infinity. The soul rises because it absorbs all the qualities, knowledge, and revelations from the previous levels. Therefore, it knows exactly what"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 37 happens on all the lower levels. Kabbalists are in the world of Atzilut . So how do they call the actions taking place there by the names of our world? The fact is, they do not lose the connection with our world; they live in both worlds, feeling simultaneously what is going on in the world of Atzilut and in our world. They know exactly the correspondence between one and the other; therefore, they call the objects in the world of Atzilut according to the properties of those that appear in our world as a projection coming from the spiritual worlds. In the world of Atzilut, there are no man-made ob- jects (e.g. radio sets, computers etc), but all other objects and forces are present there. The Kabbalist sees that a certain object in our world is the consequence of the same object in the world of Atzilut . Therefore, he gives the object (root) in the world of Atzilut the same name born by the corresponding object (branch) in our world. There is no connection between Kabbalistic comprehension and meditation or any other “mystical” notions. Everything that is studied by esoteric specialists, mystics, and pseudo-kabbalists, belongs to the human psyche, and is in no way connected with spirituality, attainment of the Creator or Kabbalah. Most of these people do not have the slightest idea of what a screen is, and without the screen, spirituality cannot be grasped. Pseudo-Kab- balists who have heard about the screen, believe they already have it, imagining they are already in the world of Infinity. Kabbalah is a secret science; it cannot be “narrated” to anyone. Only the one who feels is able to understand. Therefore, all methods, teachings, and religions belong to the com- prehension of the latent qualities of the human psyche, to the product of human brain activity. These people can do a lot. They can cure, foretell the future, and relate the past - everything that refers to the body. Man has potential powers to do whatever he wants with the physical body."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 38 However, to enter the spiritual world, one must have a screen. That is why the various kinds of predictions, tricks, miracles, including those that really exist, must not be confused with Kabbalah. One may foretell the future the way Wolf Messing and Nosrtadamus did; one can know the past by looking at a person, but none of this has anything to do with spirituality. Whatever refers to the body, to our world, can be predicted and changed; there is nothing supernatural in that. Each of us, if he so de- sires, may move away from the disturbances of civilization, and start cul- tivating such powers, and abilities. We lost these capabilities because they were substituted by the products of civilization. Every person has these natural inclinations. People with these kinds of abilities who are capable of looking at themselves critically, say that there is a Creator, but they know nothing about Him, or have noth- ing to do with Him. However, predicting man’s future, seeing his past, or making something against his will, is not connected to the world of spirit. Since these abilities are unconnected with the soul, they die to- gether with a person. The soul is a vessel, created with the help of the screen. If there is no screen, there is no soul. While there is no screen, there is only “a point in the heart”, the soul embryo. In the process of acquiring the screen, the first (still very small) ten Sefirot begin to emerge. The larger the screen gets, the larger the ten Sefirot under it become, but there are always 10 of them. If man has no screen, then he will die as he was born, no matter what great abilities he had or what he did in this world. Do you think that when a yogi does not breathe, it makes him spiri- tual? To enter the spiritual world, man must devote all of his strength, time, and desires to that end. Only the desires necessary for one's existence in this world need attending. For the spiritual world to open up, a real de- sire is necessary. Only the one who really desires it will enter the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 39 world. If you combine Kabbalah studies with something else, other than for taking care of your existence, it means that your desire is split. Right now, man can judge only from the level on which he is. He cannot know what he will be like on the next one. Everything completely changes on another level, man’s entire inner world. Thoughts, desires, reactions and outlook – everything changes. Everything is taken out of you, leaving only flesh, your outer shell; the rest is reinstalled anew. Hence, we cannot understand how this desire can be the only one. We cannot understand it now, since we are not yet on that level. When we gradually ascend to a higher level, we will feel that this desire is really formed. This desire is the only requisite for entering the spiritual worlds; and when you meet this condition, the gates of spirituality will open up before you. It should be pointed out that even a great Kabbalist cannot pre- dict man’s potential abilities. A fortuneteller might correctly predict his earthly, material future, but not man’s spiritual future. Moreover, when coming across a Kabbalist, a genuine fortuneteller feels that a prediction of his future is beyond his abilities. A Kabbalist is not interested in developing the abilities to predict his future. Forces of our world are necessary for this, and as a rule, they are totally undeveloped in a Kabbalist. A fortuneteller can name all the ailments and bodily problems of a Kabbalist. However, he has nothing to say about his “self”. He can only determine his physical condition at a given moment. A Kabbalist is constantly looking for the connection with the Creator and does not try to guess how or what he has to do to earn a better future. It would never cross a Kabbalist’s mind to know his fu- ture. Such a desire belongs to the impure forces and not to Kabbalah. By grasping the Upper world, a Kabbalist comprehends the ways of correction of all souls."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 40 All information in the spiritual world consists of five parts ( Behi- not ). One Zivug de Haka’a in the Peh de Rosh , although it involves only one kind of light, leads to formation of a Partzuf made of five parts. Partzuf made of f iv e par ts. Partzuf What does it mean - one light? One light is a general state. It consists of five parts that differ from each other quantitatively and qualitatively. However, they must always be together, as a whole set. It is similar to a sensation that is the product of five composite sub-sensations in our five senses: touch, smell, sight, hearing, and taste. Since five lights come to me, there must be five desires inside me. The difference between them has to be both quantitative and qualitative. However, all of them ultimately act together. I cannot make one desire bigger and another smaller. They form a certain combination. The light entering the vessel passes four levels. In turn, the vessel consists of five levels of the desire to receive pleasure. Now let us review paragraph 7: 7) And now understand what is written in the first part of the book “The Tree of Life”: “The creation of all worlds is a consequence of the Creator’s perfection in all His actions. However, if He had not revealed His powers in the actions that He is performing on the cre- ated beings, He would not have been called “perfect”. Thus, since the Creator is perfect, all of His actions must be per- fect. That is why He created the worlds. On the contrary, the worlds are a concealment of the Creator, the remoteness from Him. On the face of it, however, it is not clear how imperfect deeds could come out of the perfect Creator. Moreover, the Creator’s actions are so imperfect that they need to be corrected by man.From the above statement, understand that, since the essence of creation is a desire to receive pleasure, it is quite imperfect due to its being absolutely opposite to the Creator (while He is perfect and giving, the creation only receives, is imperfect, and its properties are opposite to His). On the one hand, it is infinitely remote and detached from Him. On the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 41 other hand, it is something new, born out of nothing. Creation was created to receive, and be filled with the Creator’s delight. This means that the desire to receive pleasure, albeit quite contrary to the Creator and absolutely imperfect, is, nevertheless, exactly what the Creator had to create. However, if the creations had been distanced from the Creator by their properties, He could not have been called the Perfect One, since imperfect actions cannot come from someone Perfect. Therefore, the Creator restricted His light, created the worlds, restriction after restric- tion down to our world, and put the soul into the body of our world. By “our world”, we do not mean our physical world, but the set of egoistical desires corresponding to the lowest stage of development of the worlds. “To study the Torah” means to learn for the sake of correction, not to read a book called “the Torah”. “To observe precepts,” means to per- form spiritual actions with a screen, not to carry out mechanical ac- tions. Through studying the Torah and observing its precepts, the soul achieves a perfection that it lacked in the beginning of creation. It sig- nifies the equivalence of its properties with those of the Creator. The soul would deserve to receive all the pleasure that was in the Thought of Creation. Now it will completely merge with the Creator. It means that, apart from the delight, an additional reward is pre- pared for the soul, and this reward is called “merging with the Creator”. Thus it is not just a reception of the entire light, but a merging with the Creator, a receiving of the light that appeared because of an equivalence of properties. The equivalence of properties and merging with the Creator is much higher than just receiving the light, since because of the equiva- lence of properties, the soul rises to the level of the Creator. It not only receives the light from the Creator, but also ascends to His level. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 42 it rises from the level of creation to the Creator’s level and also compre- hends that which is above its nature. העסק בבחינת רק הוא ,' ית בו לדבקה הנשמה את להביא ומצוות שבתורה הסגולה וענין ( ח הולכת לאט לאט אז כי , בלבד ליוצרו רוח נחת להשפיע בכדי רק פרס שום לקבל שלא בהם בהתחלת עקשיא בן חנניא ' ר במאמר לפנינו ש \" כמ , ליוצרה הצורה השואת וקונית הנשמה ' מה המקובלים יחידה חיה נשמה רוח נפש כוללות מדרגות ' ה בזה יש כי . ה \" עש , הספר פרטיות י \" נרנח מדרגות ' ה יש וכן . עשיה , יצירה , בריאה , אצילות , ק \" א הנקראים העולמות פרטיות דפרטי י \" נרנח יש וכן , העולמות ' מה עולם בכל שיש פרצופין ' ה מפרטיות המקובלים להשפיע ומצוות תורה י \" שע . הספר בפנים ש \" כמ , פרצוף שבכל ספירות מהעשר המקובלים האלו בהמדרגות הבאים להשפיע הרצון ' מבחי לכלים לאט לאט ומשיגים זוכים ליוצרו ר \" נ מחשבת בהם מקויימת ואז .' ית אליו לגמרי הצורה בהשוואת שבאים עד מדרגה אחר מדרגה כי , גדול הכי ריוח להם נוסף ועוד , בעדם ' ית שחשב והטוב והרוך העונג כל לקבל הבריאה . כיוצרם להשפיע הרצון שהשיגו מכח , אמיתי לדבקות גם זוכים 8) Only through indulging in the Torah and the Commandments with an intention not to receive any reward for it, but for pleasing the Creator, generates a special power (“Segula”) that enables the soul to reach the state of absolute unity with the Creator. Gradually, the soul advances by acquiring more and more new properties equal to the Creator’s, as is said in the article “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”. This ascent, merging with the Creator, consists of five levels: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya, and Yechida. These are received from five worlds: AK, Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya. When the soul rises to the world of Assiya , it receives the light of Nefesh . When it rises to the world of Yetzira, it receives the light of Ruach. In the world of Beria, it receives the light of Neshama. In the world of Atzilut, it receives the light of Haya ; and in the world of Adam Kadmon, it receives the light of Yechida . Each of these five levels is in turn divided into its own five sub-levels also called Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya, and Yechida. It receives them from the five Partzufim that form each of the five worlds. Each"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 43 sub-level has its own NaRaNHaY, which it receives from the ten Sefirot forming each Partzuf. With the help of the Torah and the Commandments with an inten- tion to please the Creator, created beings gradually acquire vessels- desires from the above-named levels until they completely merge with the Creator. Thus, a greater desire to bestow is gradually formed in the soul. In accordance with this, the soul is filled with more and more light until it achieves a complete equivalence of properties with the Creator. At this stage, the fulfillment of the Thought of Creation takes place in the souls: reception of all the delight the Creator prepared for them. Moreover, since the souls acquired the desire to bestow, they ful- ly merge (Dvekut) with the Creator and experience a perfect, eternal and infinite pleasure, much greater than the reception of the light. So the creation achieves: 1) The reception of pleasure prepared for it in the form of NaRaNHaY . 2) The equivalence of properties with the Creator, i.e. it rises to the Creator’s level and gains a perfection equal to His. We cannot yet imagine this level. We are used to operating with such notions as life, death, time, and pleasure. However, when it refers to the spiritual levels, we have neither words nor sensations to imagine or describe such states. In the process of acquiring the screen, man begins to modify his properties, accordingly receiving the light and gradually ascending. Five major levels (worlds) are divided into five sub-levels ( Partzufim ), which in turn consist of their own levels ( Sefirot ) - and all of these are characterized by greater and greater likeness to the Creator. While man is yet uncorrected, each of these levels is a concealment of the Creator from him. When man receives correction, the same level"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 44 becomes a revelation of the Creator and a light for him. That is to say, on the one hand, each stage is the concealment of the Creator, and on the other – His revelation. Each stage is a certain level of the Creator’s properties. Let us as- sume that the world of Infinity corresponds to 100% of the Creator’s properties, and is the highest level. Then our world corresponds to 0% of the Creator’s properties. The remaining spiritual Universe is between them, and is divided into 125 levels, which correspond to 125 measures of the Creator’s properties. As it was said, we have to rid ourselves of egoism, because egoism is an inferior Kli, or vessel. The moment it starts feeling pleasure, the feel- ing eliminates the desire; as a result, the pleasure dies away. This means that the moment the desire is satisfied, the pleasure immediately disap- pears. Thus an egoistical Kli can never be satisfied. Therefore, egoism is given to us only for its correction, that we may be able to feel eternal and perfect delight in it. Man feels that he has reached a certain level only when he is there. Then he knows what level he is on and what level he has already passed. He sees the next level before him, the one he has to reach. While seri- ously studying genuine Kabbalah from the authentic books, in the right group, he begins to understand the next level of his ascent. At the beginning, he feels only the concealment of that level, i.e., the Creator is hidden from him in it. Then man begins to grasp what proper- ties the Creator possesses and how he can acquire them. There are many stages along this path, but the first one is the most difficult. Compared to the first stage, comprehension of the rest of them is much easier. It proceeds from the fact that on the first level, the largest Kelim- desires are being born; precisely those Kelim that appear on the first level, afterwards show up on the last one. This is because there is a so-called inverse relationship between the lights and the vessels."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 45 Right now, we are in a condition wherein we do not know really which Kelim we are using. Although we are using very complex Kelim already, they have not yet manifested in our sensations. The biggest Aviut from Shoresh, Aleph, Bet, Gimel, and Dalet is in the world of Assiya . How- ever, the biggest screen is in the world of AK - this is the screen of AK - this is the scr een of AK Dalet , in Atzilut - the screen of Gimel , in Beria - the screen of Bet , in Yetzira - the screen of Aleph and in Assiya – the screen of Shoresh . One should always pay attention to what we refer to – whether it is the screen or the desire this screen is “dressed on”. Therefore, this is the most difficult stage of our work. Entering the spiritual world is the major problem in man’s entire spiritual quest. Afterwards man confronts other problems and the work becomes completely different. He already knows clearly what to do; gets an idea of the 10 Sefirot he acquired, has some true comprehension of the entire Universe. The Universe is built according to one principle, so if man has acquired his own (even the smallest) 10 Sefirot , then he readily knows what the Torah talks about, albeit on the level of his 10 Sefirot . If, for example, a man born in the jungle were brought to the civi- lized world, he would not know how to use certain technical devices. A person who grew up in a developed country, may not know the processes inside those devices, but he knows how to use them, because he lives among these objects. The same principle applies to a person who has reached the minimum level in the spiritual world. He has a slight idea about spirituality, already has Kelim (albeit the smallest). The innermost processes are perceived on the higher levels. When a man acquires a screen, he makes a Zivug de Haka’a and receives the Inner Light inside, which gives him an idea about spiritual- ity. We do not feel anything outside of us, we feel the world within, the spiritual world. This Inner Light, which fills the Kli , provides the mea- sure, which we call “the level” or the light, the level of “Nefesh”, “Ruach”, sure, which we call “the level” or the light, the level of “N ef esh”, “R uac h”, sure, which we call “the level” or the light, the level of “Neshama”, “Haya”, and “Yechida” ."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 46 To go forward, man should constantly absorb, pass Kabbalistic texts through his mind and heart, be filled with it all the time. There is no other method apart from studying Kabbalah with the right books, guided by a Teacher, and working in a group. Collective efforts are very important. Even a group of beginners is already a spiritual force, despite the fact that its members hardly imagine what they study Kabbalah for and what goals they have. It will be able to attract very strong spiritual light by its own efforts in the future. King David described all the spiritual states that a soul or a man goes through, from the lowest to the highest. King David (David HaM- elech , Malchut ) is called so, because he himself passed through all the spiritual states and described them. His book “ Tehilim ” (“Psalms”) is the highest level in Kabbalah, which includes all possible states of the soul. If man acquires all properties of the Creator, all His desires, habits, powers, such a state is called merging with the Creator. It means that man becomes equal to Him. What does he create? By giving to the Creator, he creates himself, creates the screen, or rather becomes the Creator’s equal partner in creating himself. The Creator created egoism, man; and man makes altruism, the Creator out of egoism, out of himself. Naturally, he does not create it out of nothing (“ Yesh mi Ayn ”) as the Creator has made our desire to receive pleasure, egoism, out of nothing. However, turning this desire into its opposite is man’s goal. This process is called “correction” ( Tikkun ). Actu- ally, it is a birth of a completely new quality. Indeed, the Creator created man’s egoism and man creates the Creator. What does it mean that the creation is made out of nothing? We know it from Kabbalists. They study all the Creator’s properties and see that He is absolutely kind and complete. Hence, He made the Creation out of nothing. When man ascends, making his properties equal to the Creator’s on the high levels called “the tenth millennium”, where the Torah’s secrets are revealed, he sees the creation itself and the way it was created by the Creator."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 47 The only sources we study are the book of the “Zohar”, the Ari’s books, the books written by the Baal HaSulam and the Rabash. Nothing else can be read independently. One can read the books of the series “Kabbalah - the Secret Science”, but nothing else. The Pentateuch can be read only when man can understand that it has an inner, Kabbalistic meaning, and is not merely an historical narrative. A long time passes before man automatically begins to see the spiri- tual actions behind the words of the Torah. It is better to read the Book of Psalms; there at least human feelings are described. Although spiritual feelings are meant there, they are more or less equivalent in our world. One will not be misled as much as by reading the Torah. It is necessary to study how to observe the precepts in our world. There is the “ Shulchan Aruch ” for that purpose. The commandments should be kept on a “simple” level. Josef Caro wrote the “ Shulchan Aruch” especially for those who wish to study Kabbalah, and want to know how the precepts should be observed without having to study the Gemarra fo- lios and having no time left for Kabbalah. One may not read The Zohar in Aramaic, only the Baal HaSulam’s commentary. וכל והתחתונים העליונים העולמות כל אשר , ל \" הנ הזוהר דברי להבין לך יקשה לא ומעתה ( ט כדי אלא באו לא והעולמות המדרגות אלו כל כי . האדם בשביל אלא נבראו לא בתוכם אשר שמתחילה . ל \" כנ , הבריאה מחשבת מבחינת להם חסר שהיה הדבקות במדת הנשמות להשלים בכדי שלנו החומרי לעולם עד עולם אחר ועולם מדרגה אחר מדרגה ונשתלשלו נצטמצמו . הארץ וחית בהמות כמו , להשפיע ולא לקבל כולו שהוא , ז \" עוה של בהגוף הנשמה את להביא ולא השפעה מבחינת בו שאין הגמור לקבל הרצון בחינת שהוא , יולד אדם פרא עייר ש \" כמ הנשמה בכח ז \" ואח . מזה יותר התרחקות שאין ,' ית אליו גמור להפכי האדם נבחן שאז , כלום בדרך לאט לאט כיוצרו ההשפעה צורת משיג שאז ומצוות בתורה ועוסק הולך בו המתלבשת , למטה מלמעלה השתלשלותם בעת שירדו הבחינות אותם כל דרך למעלה ממטה המדרגות יותר שהיא פירושה עליונה מדרגה שכל . להשפיע הרצון בצורת ושיעורים מדות רק שהם ולא להשפיע כולו להיות שזוכה עד , להשפיע רק קרובה ויותר לקבל הרצון מבחינת רחוקה שכל הרי . נברא זה בשביל רק כי ,' ית בו אמיתי בדבקות האדם נשלם ואז , לעצמו כלום לקבל . נבראו האדם בשביל רק ומלואם העולמות 9) It will not be difficult for you to understand now what is written in The Book of Zohar, that all the worlds – Upper and lower - and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 48 everything that exists in them were created only for man. All these levels were created only to fill up the souls, to direct them to perfec- tion, to the degree of merging with the Creator, which is absent from the moment of the Thought of Creation. In the beginning of creation, five worlds were formed from the Cre- ator’s level down to our world to place the soul into the material body of our world. The material body is the desire to receive without giv- ing anything in return. This is the final form of the desire to receive pleasure for itself. That is why man’s properties in our world are absolutely opposite to the Creator. By studying Kabbalah, man gradually begins to comprehend the properties of giving. According to his comprehension, he gradually ascends, learning the properties of the descending levels that have the property of bestowal. Then he reaches the level of the desire only to give, receiving nothing in return. As a result, man completely merges with the Creator, i.e., reaches the state forwhich he was created. Therefore, all the worlds were created for man’s sake. Thus, all the worlds are created to help man ascend from point zero, upwards, opposite to the Creator, and finally to reach the last point - merging with the Creator, to cover the entire journey beginning from the complete concealment of the Creator, passing 125 levels, each repre- senting a greater revelation of the Creator. We have already spoken about the fact that the Creator deliberately concealed Himself behind five worlds, each consisting of five Partzufim , each Partzuf having five Partzuf ha ving f iv e Partzuf Sefirot, overall, 125 levels of concealment. All this was done for making man absolutely remote from the Creator. Man cannot feel the Creator, he thinks he is independent, believes he has freedom of will – freedom to develop and utilize his egoism as he sees fit. Such conditions are called “our world”; in fact, they are the Creator’s forces affecting us in a state of complete concealment."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 49 Everything that surrounds us in this world is just the last level of the various forces that influence us on behalf of the Creator. Whatever man feels, inside and around himself, everything we call “our world”, is the last level that can possibly exist in the Universe. As soon as man, with the help of his inner work, is able to elimi- nate the nearest level of the Creator’s concealment from him, to draw this curtain apart, he immediately starts feeling the Creator in this mini- mal 125th part. It does not mean that 125 levels conceal the Creator from us pro- portionally. The lower the level, the more it conceals the Creator. As soon as man pulls away the lowest curtains separating him from the next level, the Creator’s light immediately begins to shine upon him, and he begins to see the Creator behind all that exists around him in this world. The still, vegetative, animal and human levels of nature - all that is around man and inside him, all his animal cravings and desires for power, honor, fame, aspiration for knowledge - for him, everything now becomes a manifestation of the Creator. He feels how the Creator affects him, his “self”, with the help of his surroundings and inner properties. The first level of revelation, though the most difficult, is the most important, because by overcoming it, man im- mediately establishes contact, albeit minimal, with the Creator, and never loses it. There is no way back. Thus, the correct beginning is paramount. Sometimes, man seems to have lost all he had gained, and has fallen from his level. However, this sensation is deliberately sent to al- low him to rise even higher. The spiritual levels are built in such a way that the concealment of the Creator on each of them depends on man’s correction. The concealment is given to him on a level he is able to overcome. Let us suppose that man has corrected 10% of his intention to re- ceive. This means that he receives pleasure in these 10% not for himself, but for the sake of the Creator. Therefore, the measure of concealment"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 50 and revelation of the Creator is the same level, its back and front parts. In other words, there is nothing outside man; all the levels are built for him and are inside him. All the spiritual worlds are inside man’s soul, forming a ladder be- tween him and the Creator. That is, they are 125 levels of our properties. Around us, there is only one thing: the completely altruistic property to bestow and please us. We call this property the Creator. However, our inner property is absolutely egoistic. The gradual correction of man’s inner properties is the purpose of his existence in our world. Everyone must correct himself. The sensation of the Creator that man gains during his correction is called “spiritual ascent” from one level to another, or from one world to the next. All this takes place solely internally. We have already said that the surrounding world is just a reaction of our inner properties to the Creator’s influence, i.e., all worlds, Partzu- fim , Sefirot , everything that we ever talk about is inside the person; there is nothing outside. One may say that outside there are only the four properties of the Direct Light. The descending light creates man and all his inner properties. All the spiritual worlds in us are just the measures of sensing the Creator. All the angels, devils, dark and light forces are no more than man’s inner forces, specially created in him by the Creator to help him constantly correct and overcome his natural egoism. Initially, they were systematically restricted, world-by-world, and descended to the level of this material world to insert the soul into the body, to dress man’s “self” in absolutely egoistic properties, infinitely remote from the Creator, the most opposite to His properties. They are called “the qualities of this world”. What is meant here is not a number of material objects surrounding us - liquids, gases, solids. By material world, we mean absolutely egoistical qualities, from the least"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 51 to the most developed, regardless of whether it is a baby or the greatest grown-up egoist in the world. When the Kabbalists say “the body of this world”, they mean the desire to receive. There is the body of our world – an egoistic desire to receive, and there is the spiritual body - the same desire to receive, but already with the screen, which means an egoistic desire transformed into an altruistic one. As stated, in order to make man wish only to receive, the Creator put the soul into the body of our world. This is the so-called “animal” state, as the proverb says, “man is born like a wild donkey”. Thus, when man descends to this world, he receives egoistic desires called “body” and with his properties becomes absolutely opposite to the Creator, infi- nitely remote from Him. The Creator gives man only one little altruistic quality called the “soul”. If man starts indulging into the Torah and the command- ments with the right intention, he gradually acquires the Creator’s desire “to bestow”. The highest level is the desire only to bestow without receiving anything for oneself. Achieving this state, man completes his way to the Creator and merges with Him. Closeness and remoteness of the spiritual objects take place because of an equivalence or difference of properties. Therefore, by achieving the state of absolute desire to bestow, i.e., the last 125-th level, man is rewarded with complete revelation of the Creator. Thus, all the worlds with everything that fills them are created only for man’s sake and for his correction. Observing the Torah and the com- mandments, with the intention to bestow pleasure upon the Creator without receiving anything in return, means adherence to the spiritual laws that man learns as he climbs these steps. Each time, when he is in a certain spiritual state, there is always a choice before him, what to do, how to think, feel, choose his thoughts, intentions, inner decisions. Although the Creator has not yet revealed"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 52 Himself to us, we have to try to compare all our thoughts, decisions, and opinions with our intention to acquire His desire to bestow. The way we analyze and choose each opinion and decision, is called “a commandment” ( Mitzvah ). When man fulfills this law correctly, he stim- ulates the candle, allowing a little more light to enter his spiritual desire. On the higher levels, upon man's entering into the spiritual worlds, he corrects his absolutely egoistic desire, and with the help of a Zivug de Haka’a (Stroke Contact) receives a portion of the light. The light he receives is called variously “the Torah”, “the Creator” or “the light of the soul”. There is a so-called Essence of the Creator ( Atzmuto HaBoreh There is a so-called Essence of the Creator ( A tzmut o HaBor eh There is a so-called Essence of the Creator ( ). We do not feel the Essence of the Creator, but only His influence. We are like a black box: whatever penetrates through our five senses - sight, hear- ing, touch, smell, and taste, or with the help of these devices, which only widen the range of our sensations - all this creates a picture of this world in us, seemingly existing outside of us. However, this world is only a product of our inner sensations, something pressing us from outside. It is like making a body out of clay and giving it a kind of sensitivity. When I press on it, it will have an inner reaction. It feels this pressure in its sensations; somehow, it is reflected in it. The body calls this outside influence (or rather its reaction to it) a certain property. Now, if someone pricks it, the body will call this outside stimula- tion (or its reaction to it) some other property. It has no idea what affects it from outside, but feels only its reactions to whatever presses on it. All the creation’s reactions to the numerous outside influences create inside it a feeling of “the surrounding” world. If aperson is deprived of one of his senses from birth, say the sight, he must build a picture of the surrounding world with the help of the remaining four. The resulting picture differs from ours. If we are able to widen somehow the range of our senses (we cannot add any more senses), then the picture of the world will instantly change."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 53 At any rate, we will perceive only what “enters” us (that is how we call our reactions to the external influences), and not what is outside. Another additional stimulation, called the Creator’s light, will en- ter us. He Himself will enter us, not just press us like a piece of clay from outside. He will enter and start filling us according to the extent of the equivalence of our properties to His. All our essence is “a piece of ego- istic clay”; if this “piece” succeeds in acquiring the Creator’s properties, i.e. learns to give, then there will be no difference between them. The outer boundary between Him and the “piece” will disappear. They will merge into one; the Creator will fill this “clay” from inside, and it will be in complete harmony, fully merged with whatever is outside. This state is the most perfect, comfortable, eternal, and absolutely good. “The piece of clay” must achieve this level. Man must reach it, be- ginning with the lowest level, called “our world”. The soul dressed into the body, forces it to work before it can ascend. The soul at its zero stage is an egoistic property, but in its final state, it must be transformed into an altruistic one. In case man is reluctant to do it on his own free will, he will be assisted from above, and then, spurred by hard sufferings, “he” will be compelled to agree. Each of these “pieces of egoism” (souls) has to overcome all 125 levels. These “pieces” are divided only because each of them feels its own small desire. In the process of likening their properties to the Creator’s, they be- gin to feel the commonness and inseparable continuity of their mass, the absolute unity of all these egoistic splinters. They understand that they represent a single whole. The more man is corrected, the more he sees himself as an absolutely inseparable part of the whole, i.e., he depends on everybody and everybody depends on him. If the creation is one whole organism, then it does not matter which part of it receives and which part gives. It is easier to be corrected as a small piece, and when all the pieces have corrected themselves, they"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 54 merge in their sensations into a single whole – this is what they call: the merging of the souls. There is much interference, all specially sent to us. Finally, only persistence wins. Man does not have to possess any special inclina- tions, intellect, particular qualities, or properties. He should only be persistent, or rather, show the ability and courage to endure; only this will lead to victory. Each of us is the way the Creator made him; nothing can be done about it. All our inner changes in thoughts, desires, and ambitions - all of these are programmed in us from above, and they all must be cor- rected. It is that very material, that ‘piece of clay’ that we must work on. A corrected egoistic property, which the Creator’s light enters, is called a “Kli” (the vessel). A person who has just begun his study of Kab- balah can be told everything; everything enters him, nothing is forgot- ten, and nothing disappears. When necessary, he will recall it, but will do so only after his correction. When he has the minimal inner vessels and this information is necessary for his work, it will emerge, “surface” out of his subconscious. Man himself will have to sort out this information and work with it. At this stage, he should not be given ready answers to his questions; now he has to search and find the answers. Being on the high levels of the spiritual development, man suffers not because the souls on lower levels feel bad. He suffers from an inabil- ity to fulfill the Creator’s desire as regards these souls, their present state; i.e., from the fact that not all souls feel the unity with the Creator the way he does. In addition, he naturally tries to accelerate this process by dissemination of Kabbalah, by spreading the knowledge about the neces- sity of correction, while others interfere with his mission. Man needs the entire world in order to complete his spiritual work, because it consists not only in self-correction, but also on each level there is certain mutual work to be done with the rest of the souls."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 55 A Kabbalist must feel the entire world, feel its sufferings, absorb them on his level, and correct them. Moreover, on each level, the inclu- sion of all the souls into his and his own into all other souls takes place. של פחד שום בלי זו חכמה ללמוד לך מותר כבר , זה כל ולדעת להבין שזכית אחר ועתה ( י מתחילת והפרצופין ס \" הע שכל נאמר אחד שמצד , מאד מתבלבלים המעיינים כי . ו \" ח הגשמה השמות שער ד \" מ שער ח \" ע ) . גמור ואחדות אלקיות הוא דעשיה ס \" הע סוף עד האצילות ס \" ע אפילו יתכן ואיך , הצמצום אחר ובאים מחודשים העולמות אלו שכל נאמר ' הב ומצד (' א פרק וירידות ועליות מהשנוים וכדומה ומטה ומעלה מספרים בחינת וכן . באלקיות זה להרהר .' וכו שניתי לא הויה אני כתוב ומקרא , וזווגים 10) Now after having grasped this much, you may study Kabbalah without fear of materializing the spiritual. The beginners in Kabbal- ah are confused because it is said that all 10 Sefirot and Partzufim beginning from the world of Atzilut and down to the 10 Sefirot of the world of Assiya are absolutely divine and spiritual, i.e., in fact it is the Creator Himself. On the other hand, it is said that all these worlds were created be- cause of the Tzimtzum (restriction). Then how can one say the divine Sefirot, which refer to the Creator, appeared after the Tzimtzum? Besides, how should one take such notions as quantity, up, down, rise, fall, spiritual merging, separation etc.? How can all this be said about the divine and perfect? It is said, “I change nothing; I am everywhere, the only One unchang- ing Creator”. How can one say that transformations and restrictions exist in the perfect One, since any change speaks of imperfection? The question is simple: what we call worlds - is it the Creator or the creation? Why are beginners confused by it?It is because, as a rule, they materialize it. They try to imagine these worlds in the form of material objects. It is a natural reaction for a man limited by his reality. Yet, how can he be given the correct perception; is it possible at all? There are risks for people who study Kabbalah without a true guide, a person that would constantly direct them, prevent them from"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 56 getting off the right track, and from materializing spirituality. For this reason, Kabbalah was kept away from the masses for centuries. If, at the beginning, man deviates one millionth of a degree from the right way, then in time, this deviation from the goal will gradually increase. Consequently, the more he advances and, as it seems to him, draws nearer to the goal, the more he moves away from it. Therefore, the Kab- balists made certain demands and restrictions for those who wanted to study Kabbalah. It is better to remain on the mechanical level of observ- ing the commandments (the common Surrounding Light shines upon man and purifies him slowly) than to study Kabbalah alone. Unfortunately, we see self-taught Kabbalists and to what it has led them;they fabricate their own concepts about the spiritual world, popu- late it with all kinds of bodies, forces and their interactions, with winged angels, devils, witches, hell, and paradise, etc. They do this without un- derstanding that the spiritual world is only inside of man’s soul, while only the Creator is outside. The Kabbalists were deeply concerned about all this. The principal commandment is not to make an idol out of your own egoism. Whether you want it or not, you worship it anyway - it is an idol made inside of you; from your birth, you worship only your own desires, thinking only about how to satisfy them. Not to make an idol means not putting your own idol in place of the Creator. If you truly desire to enter spirituality, to have any contact with it, do not make a false picture of it in your imagination, for it leads astray. It is said, “To sit and do nothing is preferable to making a mistake”. A question arises: Can a man studying Kabbalah interfere with other people’s matters? Can he explain anything to them? He can and should, but very carefully. A book can be given to read; one can talk a little about Kabbalah, but never argue the point. It can be harmful to you. You will lose everything you have gained by your own efforts and studies. Kabbalah should be popularized unob-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 57 trusively, never try to convince a person. It will not help anyway. Man’s egoism is stronger than any influence from outside. You will never make him change his mind. You can direct him only if he wants it. Man per- ceives something only when he feels he can fill his desire. אינם , והמספר , והצמצומים וירידות העליות אלו כל כי היטב מובן לפנינו ובהמתבאר ( יא כח בחינת בהם להבחין שיש אלא . הנשמות שהם , המקבלים של הכלים בבחינת אלא נבחנים הבית תכונת אמנם , תחילה במחשבתו מעשה שסוף בית הבונה לאדם בדומה , פועל ובחינת הוא במחשבה הבית בעוד כי , בפועל לצאת הצריך להבית דמיון שום לו אין במחשבה לו שיש נמצא אז כי , החושב האדם של החומר לבחינת ונחשבת , מחשבתי חומר מבחינת רוחניות חומר מקבלת כבר בפועל לצאת מתחילה הבית שמלאכת בעת כ \" משא ,\" כח \" בבחינת רק הבית אשר , ופועל כח הנשמות בבחינת להבחין יש כן . ואבנים עצים של חומר דהיינו לגמרי אחר וענין , הבריאה בעולם רק מתחיל \" בפועל \" נשמות לבחינת מאציל מכלל יציאתם התחלת בחינת אמור זה הנה ,' ב באות ל \" כנ , הבריאה מחשבת בבחינת הצמצום מטרם ה \" ב ס \" בא התכללותם כלולים היו הנשמות שכל נאמר זו ומבחינה . וכלל כלל ממשי הכר שום בלי \" הכח \" ' בבחי רק הנשמות של הכלים מכל \" כח \" ב כלולה זו נקודה כי , האמצעית נקודה המכונה ס \" דא במלכות בנקודה רק נעשה לא ' א הצמצום וענין . ולמטה הבריאה מעולם \" פועל \" ב לצאת העתידים לנשמות \" כח \" לבחינת נחשבת שהיא והשיעור הבחינה באותו בדיוק רק והיינו , הזו האמצעית הבריאה לעולם עד והעולמות הספירות של הכלים כל כי ותדע . בעצמותה כלום ולא , העתידים בבחינת כ \" ג המה ח \" או ' הנק שלה דהכאה הזווג בסבת או זו מנקודה ויוצאים המשתלשלים הנשמות על כ \" אח לפעול עתידים הללו שהשינוים אלא , הנשמות של מהות שום בלי לבד כח .' ית המאציל ממהות יצאו לא עדיין שם כי ולמטה הבריאה מעולם לצאת מתחיל שמהותם 11) From the above statement, we can conclude that all these worlds, Partzufim and the processes taking place in them (ascents, descents, restrictions etc.), are all man’s inner vessels of reception, the proper- ties of his soul. That is to say, everything about which one reads in Kabbalah tran- spires inside of man’s soul, and has two aspects: what happens in thought and what happens in action. It is similar to a situation in which a man builds a house: the end of his action is already inte- grated into his original plan. The image of a house, the very notion “house” in man’s thoughts, is different from the real house, because the structure existing only as a plan is made of the material of his ideas. As the process of build-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 58 ing begins, the plan acquires other qualities, different properties that gradually materialize, and turn into a structure made of wood and stone, etc. The thought materializes more and more until it comes to its final form, expressed in the materialized idea – a house. Also with regard to the souls, one should differentiate between the two parts: the plan and the action. The state of souls in the world of Infinity, i.e., when they were united with the Creator, before all restrictions, one with the Thought of Creation, is called “the souls in the Thought of Creation”. In the Thought of Creation, these souls are in the Creator without any distinction between them. This state is called Ein Sof – the world of Infinity. A similar state continues in the worlds of Adam Kadmon and Atzilut. The state, wherein souls receive, and are sep- arated from the Creator, is called “the souls in the act of creation”. This separation takes place on the level of the world of Beria. The world of Beria (the word “Beria” derives from the same root as the word “bar” which means “out of”, “except for”) is the first one below the world of Atzilut , under the Parsa . Starting from the world of Beria , there is a transition of the souls into the state of “action”. The world of Beria is the first world, where the souls, as it were, fall out of the Creator’s plan and become more materialized, “indepen- dently” existing. All the thoughts and desires in our world and in the spiritual ones descend to us from above. What one should do with these thoughts and desires in our world and in the spiritual ones is the subject of our studies. Nothing that is inside or outside you is created by you. You react to any outside irritation according to your animal nature. Any reaction of this kind can be calculated in advance and your actions can be predicted in any given situation. So where is even the slightest freedom of choice or freedom of will here? Freedom of will is only in the effort to understand how the Creator would act in my place and react similarly."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 59 Somehow or other, the entire world obeys the Creator’s will; not even an atom can move against it. The difference lies in the fact that a Kabbalist consciously tries to correlate his actions with those of the Creator. With all his desires, he wants to follow the stream that the Creator set in motion for the entire Universe. Thus, he enters the most comfortable state of absolute “relaxation” (freedom and eternal peace). Time stops, everything disappears except for the sensation of in- finity, because there are no disturbances, no contradiction between you, the entire Universe and the Creator. It is said that every soul is included in Malchut of the world of Infinity, called “the central point”, for this point is the Thought, and all the vessels come out of it, all the proper- ties of the soul in action. This action begins in the world of Beria and continues into the worlds of Yetzira and Assiya . Everything found in the worlds of Infinity, Adam Kadmon and Atzi- lut , still belongs to the Creator’s Thought. We know it from the emana- tion of the four phases of Direct Light. The light coming out of the Creator is called “ Behina Shoresh ”. Then the light completes the creation of the Kli , but it has no independent sensations. This phase is called “ Behina Aleph ”. In phase Shoresh, the light came out of the Creator; in the phase, Aleph, the Kli came out of the Creator. Both of these phases are still under the Creator’s complete power, totally in His Thought; they are not yet separated from Him. The world of Adam Kadmon corresponds to phase Shoresh ; the world of Atzilut corresponds to phase Aleph ( Gal- galta is Shoresh le Ohrot , AB is Shoresh le Kelim ). Tzimtzum Aleph (the First Restriction) was performed on that central point, i.e., on its property, to the extent that it is a Thought as regards the future souls. Regarding the Creator, there is no restriction in this point, only concerning the souls coming out of this central point."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 60 You must know that all these vessels, Sefirot, and worlds down to the world of Beria, which descend from this central point in con- sequence of the Zivug de Haka’a, are called “Ohr Hozer” (the Re- flected Light). They are all considered as \"The Thought of Creation\", without being distinguished as independent souls. However, these transformations are already included in the plan, then realized in action, in the process of the souls’ descent from the world of Beria. Before the world of Beria, they are still inseparably connected to the Creator’s properties. The introductions to the Kabbalistic books are very complicated; their purpose is to dispose the man who studies Kabbalah correctly, to channel his inner efforts in the right direction. If one deviates from this course, he is unable to understand a Kabbalistic book. Man’s task is to realize what happens to him, and how the Cre- ator works with him from above, so that he will completely agree with the Creator’s actions. The righteous person is the one who justifies the Creator’s actions. When man gives completely and enjoys, he lets in the Upper Light through himself, which then returns to its Source; it is the Reflected Light ( Ohr Hozer), which comes from above as Direct Light ( Ohr Yashar ) and is reflected, completely filling the entire vessel. Ohr Yashar dresses onto Ohr Hozer and man becomes a single whole with the Creator. Man approaches the Universe in essentially two ways: (i) called “ Da’at Ba’alabaitim” – petty owners’ opinion, i.e., the opinion of egoistic masses. (ii) – “Da’at Torah” . The word “Torah” derives from the word light ( Ohr , Ohra’a - the way to the Creator). These two approaches are absolutely contrary to each other. The problem is that while we are still in the bounds of our world and have not yet acquired the spiritual properties, we cannot understand that those two approaches to the Universe are opposite to each other. It happens because as man acquires the spiritual properties, time and space merge into one point for him and all movement stops."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 61 This is when he begins to see everything as absolutely static, noth- ing happens around him, but everything takes place inside him. Accord- ing to his inner spiritual state, his spiritual qualities, and properties, man begins to see a totally different world around him. Every time these qualities are transformed in him, he sees a com- pletely different picture. Then he discovers that the entire picture around him is in fact absolutely static, and it changes only inside him, according to the transformation of his properties, the organs of receiving “exter- nal” information (external – illusory, in fact only man is changing). In fact, there is static, amorphous, homogeneous spiritual light around us, which is called “The Creator”. Similarly, with our five senses, we also have five spiritual ones: spiritual eyes (sight), ears (hearing), nose (smell), mouth (taste), and hands (touch). Depending on their qualities, carrying capacity and sensitivity, we will constantly receive different im- pressions from this homogeneous spiritual light. The most primitive im- pression is the one we receive today. The homogeneous spiritual light is perceived in our senses; it forms a cumulative picture of the Universe in our consciousness, which we call “our world”, “this world”. If our senses change a little bit, i.e., become less opposite to this light, come closer to it in their properties and receive altruistic properties, then they will begin to perceive it more correctly, more as it actually is. Such complex sensations of oneself through one’s own five senses will give him a picture, which is called the world of Assiya . The world of Assiya is no more than the measure of sensation of one’s correction or difference from the light, from the Creator. Therefore, it is said that all worlds are inside man. If we develop our senses even more, by changing our egoism into spiritual altruism, we will receive an even more correct picture of the light, called the world of Yetzira and so on. On the highest level, when we completely correct ourselves, we will perceive an undistorted picture"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 62 of the Upper Light, i.e., the homogeneous light will fill us, enter through our five senses, and then we will feel the Creator Himself in all His true properties, thoughts, and desires as regards us. Man must reach this state of complete merging with the Creator while still being in our world. Man’s attitude to everything around him, as well as his reactions, are dictated by the level he is on, i.e., everything is determined by his present, partially corrected and uncor- rected properties. You cannot change your attitude about what is going on, nor react differently to it until you change yourself. Then your inner, improved, new properties will naturally earn you a different and better attitude. When man begins to study Kabbalah, it seems to him that he will be able to progress with the help of his reasoning mind, analyzing, re- searching, and making conclusions. One writes a summary, another is tape-recording the lessons - it is natural, because the mind is our tool of perception and analysis of the world. However, this is true only in the bounds of our world. In fact, spiritual comprehension occurs differently. When man makes an effort, although his intentions are absolutely egoistical, he at- tracts upon himself an increased emanation of the Surrounding Light ( Ohr Makif ). This surrounding emanation is already directed at a cer- Ohr Makif ) . T h i s s u r r o u n d i n g e m a n a t i o n i s a l r e a d y d i r e c t e d a t a c e r - Ohr Makif tain person, and not at the masses. A person who studies according to the Kabbalistic method, attracts to himself a personal emanation of the Surrounding Light. This light begins to push man forward to spirituality; it “pulls” him up. This is a totally different way: not with the help of one’s mind; it actually deprives man of his earthly mind: little by little he is sent circumstances with which he is bound to struggle. The light forces him to act; it “throws” him from side to side, from one circumstance into another, to arouse new sensations in him, to prepare him to feel spirituality."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 63 The emanation of the Surrounding Light intensifies and we begin to feel worse. Why? We feel that, there is something on the outside, stronger, and better, that cannot enter us. Thus, we experience periods of depression. In fact, this means that the actual reason for our depres- sions is that we receive from above a more powerful emanation. Man can in no way predict the next level in his spiritual develop- ment by his own mind. A possibility to somehow consciously control one’s spiritual states (actually, they are not spiritual yet) disappears. In- deed, it is done to bring man to part with his earthly mind, to let him acquire a mind of a different sort: faith above reason. It is called “enter Ibur” (enter into the state of an embryo) inside a higher spiritual Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf It can only be done when man completely shuts off his intellectual, analytical properties belonging to this world. He totally surrenders to the higher force and wants to be completely included in it. The masses shun this approach. In Kabbalah, when man progresses by faith above reason, he first controls what is going on with him and then consciously switches off his mind. The masses exist in faith below reason. The Zohar calls them “Domem de Kedusha”. “Domem” means 'still', 'lifeless', “ Kedusha ” means 'holy', i.e., “the holy still level”. What does this mean? There are five levels in the Universe: -still -vegetative -animal -human -and one more, the highest level - Divine . These are the five levels of nature. In the spiritual world, according to this division, there are also five levels of development of man’s inner properties. What is the meaning of the lowest “spiritually still” level? One is in the same static, “motionless” state, one similar to the 'still life' in nature,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 64 perhaps even a stone. This is because you were created so, and were told how everything should be done. One makes everything on a “still” level, without an attitude of one’s own, without a personal spiritual intention, one just carries out certain spiritual actions that correspond to the spiritual laws, but performs them “mechanically”, without involving one’s personal “self”. In the spiritual world, interaction between the human soul and the Creator takes place. The general interaction between man and the Creator is divided into 620 different actions, called commandments, 620 laws, spir- itual actions that man carries out when he passes all levels, beginning from our world and up to the level of completely merging with the Creator. There are 620 levels separating us from the Creator, each of which is overcome by the fulfillment of a certain spiritual action, which is called a commandment (a law or condition). This spiritual action is fulfilled only by man’s intention, or rather by changing his intention from “for himself” to “for the sake of the Cre- ator”. The size of the altruistic intention with which man performs the action is determined by the spiritual level he has reached. If we carry out all 620 spiritual actions, in only mechanical way, without correcting the intention, as do the masses, we attract a Sur- rounding Light that maintains these masses in the way that it preserves 'still nature' in a certain form. This light inspires them to continue to do what they were taught, but does not move them forward, does not turn them from the spiritually 'still nature' into the 'vegetative' one. To pass from the spiritually 'still nature' into the spiritually 'vegeta- tive', one must have the special method that we study here. The moment man passes this threshold and becomes spiritually 'vegetative'; he has already entered the spiritual world. Then later, when he first develops his vegetative nature, that is, if he performs certain spiritual actions, constantly corrects his intentions, and thus carries out, perhaps, 100 pre- cepts, this refers to the vegetative spiritual layer. Next, if he performs 100-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 65 150 precepts, this refers to the animal spiritual layer. After performing 200-300 precepts, this refers to the human spiritual layer. The remaining precepts belong to the Divine layer, Keter . I offer this idea as an illustra- tion, not as a specific example. All spiritual levels, from zero to 620, are based on the principle that man changes himself internally, constantly improving, becoming more and more similar to the Creator, until there is no difference be- tween them. However, on our present lowest level, we can observe the com- mandments only mechanically. Mechanical action will never let us pass from the 'spiritually still' level to the 'vegetative' one. Only with the help of Kabbalah, one can break through it. This method attracts onto us the special Surrounding Light and pulls us out of this world, transforming “a stone” into “a plant”. Man is born as any other animal in this world, and there is nothing spiritual in him. The only thing you can say about man, with all the “in- tricacies” one can acquire from all kinds of oriental teachings, is that all this belongs to the inner “mental” (let us just put it this way) level of an animal called “man of our world”. These various 'wisdoms' speak about forces that accompany our physical body. Auras, Chakras etc. all exist, but they are biological, bio-energy structures of the human body. Animals possess them too; as a rule, they are even more sensitive to bio- and psycho- fields than man is. Anyone can develop these abilities. All this refers to the physical body, but science has not pursued this research. Nowadays it has started developing more, and many things are not clear yet, but in principle, all this is subject to tests and research on an absolutely scientific basis, involving no spiritual corrections of man himself. Of course, man morally influences these fields, but still remains an egoist, or rather an egoistic altruist (gives for his own sake)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 66 Thus, man is born with all these mental dispositions, which he can develop. There is only one more peculiarity: apart from egoistic de- sires, man can be given only one more desire, which is non-existent in our world. This is a desire to give, which is a spiritual desire. It is called “ Nekuda she baLev ” (a point in the heart). Later we will examine how it is inserted into a human heart. In fact, it is inserted into man’s egoistic “self”, i.e., our entire organism is built on our egoistic “self”. All of a sudden, a point, an embryo of the spiritual, altruistic “self”, enters egoism. In principle, this point has nothing to do with man, because he is a totally egoistic creature. Biologically, man is very similar to animals. He differs from them only by this “black point”. Why is it called “black”? Is it not spiritual? It is because it is not yet filled with the light. With the help of Kabbalah, when the individual Surrounding Light begins to shine, it illuminates this “black point”, and thus it begins to feel tension, disparity between itself and the light. Continuing to study, man gradually begins to develop this point; it expands, until ten Sefirot are formed in it. As soon as there are the first ten Sefirot in the “black point”, they are included in the structure of the higher spiritual Partzuf; this is then called “ Ibur ” (conception). This point is an embryo of the soul. The first 10 Sefirot acquired by man are called the soul, the vessel of the soul. The light that fills them is called “the light of the soul”. Man should develop this point up to a degree where it will en- able him to turn all his egoistic properties into altruistic ones. A “black point” begins “to swell” as man adds egoism to it and turns it into al- truism. This point is Sefira Keter . Out of it, with the help of additional egoism, 10 Sefirot begin to develop. The more egoism man adds to it, the bigger spiritual Kli , called “soul”, he receives. However, if this does not happen, then as man was born an ani- mal, so he will die. On the other hand, if he has developed his spiritual"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 67 Kli even a little bit, albeit he has not reached the spiritual world, and if he has been influenced by the spiritual light, it remains in him forever. Because this newly formed quality does not refer to the body, does not die with it, it refers to the “black point”, which is spiritual, i.e., eternal. Therefore this work, this effort is not lost. How can one make at least 10 of the smallest Sefirot out of this point? Let us assume that we take one gram of our egoism and provide it with a screen. Egoism plus the screen combined with this point gives us the smallest spiritual Kli . There is no need for a screen as far as the “black point” is concerned, because man receives it from above. Now let us come back to the question of free will. In the Baal Ha- Sulam’s book, “ Pri Hacham. Igrot ”, it is written, “As I have already said on behalf of the Baal Shem Tov, before one performs any spiritual action (a commandment is meant), there is no need to think about the Creator’s personal Providence, but on the contrary, man must say: 'If I don’t help myself, then who will?'” However, after he completes this action with the absolute confi- dence that everything depends only on him and the Creator does not exist at all, he has to collect his thoughts and believe that he has per- formed this spiritual action not by his own efforts, but only thanks to the Creator’s presence, because such was His initial intention. One should also act similarly in everyday, regular proceedings, be- cause the spiritual and the earthly are alike. So before man leaves home to earn what he has to earn during the day, he must completely switch off the thought of the Creator’s personal Providence saying: “If I don’t help myself, then who will?”, and do exactly what the rest of the people who earn their living do in the world. But in the evening, when he comes back home with what he has earned, he should by no means think he has earned it by his own efforts, but believe that if he had not left home at all, he would have got the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 68 same. Since it was planned by the Creator in advance how much he had to earn during that day, in the evening he had to receive it anyway. In spite of the fact that in our mind, these two approaches to the same action contradict each other, and neither our mind nor our heart perceives them, man must believe it anyway. It seems contradictory to us, because our properties are contrary to the Creator’s, and have not entered the spiritual space yet, where all opposites unite in a single whole and all contradictions disappear, “drown” in the Unity. There is the Divine Providence called HaVaYaH - which means that the Creator controls everything and man can in no way take part in this control, and that all his thoughts, desires, actions, etc., are given to him from outside. Then there is the Divine Providence called “ Elokim ” with Gematria (numerical value of Hebrew letters and words) equal to “ Teva ” (nature). This is Providence through nature, when man, regardless of the Creator’s absolute control, acts according to his nature. If man tries to combine these two kinds of Providence inside him (although they do not match in his mind, nor in his heart, he actually goes above his mind), these attempts finally lead to their union, and he sees there is no contradiction. However, until we reach such unity, we will ask the same question all the time: who has done this - the Creator or I? Moreover, there is no getting away from these questions until we come to the level where HaVaYaH – Elokim concur; then we may understand. We speak here about man’s attitude to action. Before acting, man consciously decides to be under the control of Elokim ; it gives him an opportunity to analyze his actions and his attitude toward them. Thus, he juxtaposes these two systems and brings his “self” to the likeness with the Creator, constantly remembering their existence. If man forgets or does not know about the existence of the two sys- tems, he is influenced only by nature ( Elokim ), not by the Creator’s per- sonal Providence ( HaVaYaH ). Without juxtaposing these two systems, accepting only one of them (either He controls everything or I do), it"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 69 turns out that either the Creator or man does not exist. Man’s advance- ment to the Creator is only possible when he can forcefully combine these two providential systems in himself before each action. כיסוים במיני עצמו את ומעלים המתכסה האדם למשל , הזה דעולם מהויות לך ואמשול ( יב התפעלות איזה לו יש עצמו שהוא הדעת על יעלה הכי , ירגישו ולא חברו יראנו שלא ולבושים קוראים שאנו ס \" הע למשל כן , שמתכסה הכסוים ריבוי מחמת וכדומה העלמה של משהו ס \" שא כסוים עשר רק הם , מלכות יסוד הוד נצח ת \" ת גבורה חסד בינה חכמה כתר בשמות באותם לקבל מחויבים יהיו ממנו לקבל העתידים הנשמות אשר , בהם ומתעלם מתכסה , ס \" שבע הזה המספר ידי על מתפעלים המקבלים ונמצאים , להם מודדים ס \" והע השיעורים ממש מדרגות לעשר נחלקים המקבלים כ \" משא , שינוי בלי יחיד אחד שהוא ' ית אורו כלל ולא בערך אינם שאמרנו הכיסוים בחינות אלו אפילו אלא עוד ולא . הללו השמות תכונת לפי מהעשר המקבלות הנשמות נמצאות כבר שם רק כי , ולמטה הבריאה מעולם רק האמור שם כי להנשמות אפילו מציאות שום אין עוד ואצילות ק \" א בעולמות כ \" משא , ההם ספירות עולמות ' בג רק שולטים הם ס \" בע האמורים כיסוים העשר ענין ולפיכך . הכח בבחינת רק הם ספירות העשר נבחנים ע \" בי בהעולמות גם אמנם . עשיה יצירה בריאה ' הנק התחתונים הוא ההפרש רק , הצמצום מטרם וכמו ע \" ואבי ק \" בא כמו ממש , עשיה סוף עד לאלקיות להיותם , שליטה של גילוי בחינת אפילו עוד להם אין ואצילות ק \" בא אשר , ס \" הע של בהכלים והכיסוי ההעלמה כח לגלות ס \" הע של הכלים מתחילים ע \" בבי ורק , ל \" כנ \" כח \" ' בבחי רק שם ס \" וז במשל ל \" כנ הללו הכסוים מחמת משהו של שינוי שום אין ס \" שבע באור אמנם . שבהם .' וכו שניתי לא ה \" הוי אני 12) I will give you an example from our world. Let us assume that a man is hiding from strangers, so that no one can see or feel him, but he is not able to hide from himself. It is likewise with the 10 Sefirot that we call Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Malchut. They are just 10 curtains behind which the world of Infinity is concealed. The souls will have to receive whatever light the 10 Sefirot transfer to them from the Infinity in the future. Note well , there are Infinity, the 10 hidden screens and the Souls. If a soul is behind all 10 “covers”, it does not feel the world of Infinity at all. As the soul “takes off” these “covers”, it approaches the world of Infinity and begins to feel it more and more. The measures of sensation of the world of Infinity are called the worlds: Adam Kadmon, Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira, Assiya, or levels of the spiri-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 70 tual ladder, 620 levels, 125 levels, 10 levels, Sefirot. It does not matter how one calls them; the path and the distance are the same. Souls acquire the properties of the light depending on how much of it and from which level of the 10 Sefirot they receive, behind whatever Sefirot t h e y r e c e i v e , b e h i n d w h a t e v e r Sefirot “cover” they happen to be. The light inside the 10 Sefirot is absolutely ho- mogeneous and static on all levels of all the worlds, whereas the receiving souls are divided into 10 levels, corresponding to the properties of the names of these levels. This means that the Creator is indivisible and unchanging in In- finity. Being on one of the levels, the soul receives through the screens- concealments of the Creator and, naturally, it already receives the dis- torted light. Each of these names - Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut - means a certain property, concealing and at the same time revealing. On the one hand, each name speaks of how much it conceals the Creator, on the other hand, it speaks of how much I reveal the Creator if I ascend to that level. These are two contrary directions - the measure of concealment and the measure of revelation. All of these concealing screens about which we now speak act only in the world of Beria and below, for the souls receiving this light are only in these three worlds Beria, Yetzira and Assiya. What does this mean? The souls can even be higher than the worlds of Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya, but only as they ascend with these worlds. In other words, the souls are always in these three worlds. The notion “ascent of the worlds” means that, if man leaves this world, he can be in the world of Assiya , then in the world of Yetzira , then in the world of Beria , but he cannot ascend above the world of Beria . If he ascends, he does it only inside these worlds. Through his efforts, he makes these worlds ascend with him. These worlds are his cover. With these worlds he ascends to Atzilut , and then to the world of Infinity."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 71 In the worlds Adam Kadmon and Atzilut, the souls exist only in Thought, being inseparable from the Creator. Hence, these 10 “cov- ers” act only in the 10 Sefirot in the worlds Beria, Yetzira, and As- siya. Nevertheless, even in these worlds the 10 “covers” are considered absolutely divine, down to the very end of the world of Assiya. There is no distinction between the Sefirot and the Creator, exactly as before all restrictions. The difference is only in the Kelim that the 10 Sefirot consist of, since in the worlds Adam Kadmon and Atzilut, the power of the 10 Sefirot has not yet manifested sufficiently, for these 10 Sefirot are only in a Thought. Their Kelim begin to express their concealing power only in the worlds of Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya. However, due to “the covers”, the light in these 10 Sefirot remains unchanged, as stated: “I never change, - the Creator says about Himself, - I am omnipresent and “change” only in man’s eyes, depending only on his ability to feel Me and the degree of correctionof his properties, his eyes”. כ \" א , המקבלים הנשמות למהות גילוי שום שם עוד אין ואצילות ק \" שבא כיון , לשאול ואין ( יג בזה ויש . הללו בשיעוריהם ומכסים מעלימים המה ולמי ס \" ע ' הנק ההם הכלים משמשים מה הנשמות גם כי הוא ' והב . הספר בפנים שתמצא כמו ההשתלשלות דרך שכן ,' הא : תשובות ' ב , אליהם ע \" בי העולמות ' הג עליות בדרך דהיינו , ואצילות ק \" שבא ההם ס \" מהע לקבל עתידים מה כפי , ס \" שבע השינוים אלו ואצילות ק \" בא גם להבחין יש ולפיכך , קסג באות להלן ש \" כמ לפי יקבלו אז כי , ע \" בי העולמות עם שמה יעלו שהם בשעה להנשמות להאיר עתידים שהם . ההם ס \" שבע המדרגה 13) Questions may arise: if there is no manifestation of the souls re- ceiving the light in the worlds Adam Kadmon and Atzilut, then why are the 10 Sefirot there, the 10 Kelim? What arethe worlds Adam Kadmon and Atzilut for, if there are no souls there? If these worlds do not conceal or hamper anything, then what is their role? Also, if they hamper the light by various measures, then who is it for? There are two answers: a) All the worlds and the Sefirot must develop this way. b) In the future, souls must receive from the 10 Sefirot in the worlds"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 72 Adam Kadmon and Atzilut, due to the ascent of the worlds Beria, Yetzira and Assiya to Atzilut, and then to Adam Kadmon. Hence, there must be steps, places prepared in advance in these worlds, so that the worlds Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya could ascend there, enter them, and receive a greater revelation of the Creator. Otherwise, a soul cannot ascend; it can do so only with the worlds of Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya, because this is the way the souls will have to ascend there, and these worlds will shine upon the souls at the time. Then each of them will receive its level out of these 10 Sefirot . , וכדומה מדרגות ומספר והשינוים החידוש ובחינת העולמות שענין , היטב נתבאר הרי ( יד שיכלו להם ומודדים ומעלימים להנשמות המשפיעים הכלים בבחינת אלא נאמר לא זה כל באור משהו של התפעלות שום עושים אינם והם , המדרגה בדרך שבהם ה \" ב ס \" א מאור לקבל ולקבל אותו להרגיש הרוצה השני על רק המתכסה על פועלים כיסוים אין כי , עצמו ה \" ב ס \" א . במשל ל \" כנ ממנו 14) Thus, we see that Kabbalah speaks about all the worlds and lev- els, about everything but the Creator. It refers to the Kelim, the vessels that measure off the states of concealments for the souls, so that after- wards they will be able to receive the light from the world of Infinity according to their levels. All these concealing curtains affect only those who are supposed to receive the light and not the One, who like the Source, hides behind them, i.e., they do not influence the Creator. The worlds are levels like lifeless filters in our world; they hamper the light, but contrary to the live souls, they cannot consciously take part in the process of communication with the Creator. The Sefira (screen, world) by itself is a lifeless device for concealing the spiritual light from the souls. What kind of a device is that? We have already spoken about it - this device inside us is our egoism. : הללו בחינות ' ג את , שהם מקום בכל , ובפרצופין בהספירות להבחין יש , כלל ובדרך ( טו יש ובכלים , כלל בו תפיסא מחשבה לית ' ית בעצמותו אשר . ואורות כלים ,' ית עצמותו על מעלים הוא מתחילתו הכלי ענין כי , וגילוי העלמה שהם , לזה זה הפכים הבחנות ' ב תמיד אחר אמנם . העלמות של מדרגות עשר הם ס \" שבע כלים העשרה שאלו באופן ,' ית עצמותו ' לבחי ההעלמות אלו נעשים אז הנה שבהם התנאים בכל הללו להכלים מקבלים שהנשמות"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 73 כי , אחת שהם לזו זו הפכיות הבחנות ' ב כוללים שהכלים הרי . הנשמות להשגות גילויים של שהוא דהיינו , עב יותר שהכלי וכל שבהכלי ההעלמה מדת כפי ממש הוא שבכלי הגילוי מדת . אחת הם הללו הפכים ' שב הרי גדולה יותר קומה מגלה הוא ' ית עצמותו על מעלים יותר כי . הנשמות להשגת להתגלות הראוי קומה שיעור אותו , פירושן שבהספירות האורות וענין כ \" ע , ל \" כנ הכלים של בתכונתם רק בו השגה אין זה ועם ' ית מעצמותו נמשך שהכל מתוך המקבלים אל גילוים של מדרגות עשר דהיינו , הללו כלים בעשרה אורות עשרה בהכרח יש בעצמותו אשר , בזה רק ' ית לעצמותו ' ית אורו בין להבדיל שאין באופן . הכלים אותם בתכונת של בהכלים התלבשותו דרך ' ית ממנו אלינו המגיע זולת כלל ביה תפיסא השגה לית ' ית . אורות בשם מכנים אנו בהשגה הבא כל זו ומבחינה , ס \" הע 15) Hence, we may divide these Sefirot and Partzufim into three parts: the Creator’s Essence, the vessels, and the light. We have no way of understanding or feeling the Creator Himself, neither in our sensations, nor in our mind. There are always two opposite properties in the vessels, “conceal- ment” and “revelation”, because the vessel first conceals the Creator, so that these 10 vessels, called the 10 Sefirot, represent the levels of concealment. However, after the souls are corrected, according to the spiritual conditions dictated by the 10 Sefirot, these levels of conceal- ment turn into the levels of revelation, attainment of the Creator. Thus, it turns out that the vessels consist of two properties contrary to one another, and the degree of revelation inside the vessel (man, the soul) is the same as the degree of concealment. The rougher the vessel (the soul), i.e., the more it conceals the Creator and the more egoistic it becomes in the process of correction, the more powerful the light that is revealed in it at the end of correction . Thus, these two opposite properties are in fact just a single one. The light inside the Sefirot is a measure of the Creator’s light received by the souls according to their corrected properties. Everything comes out of the Creator: both the vessels and the light that fills them. Therefore, there are always 10 lights inside the 10 vessels, i.e., 10 levels of revelation according to the properties of the vessels."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N T O T H E A R T I C L E “ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 74 We cannot distinguish between the Creator and His light. Outside of the vessel, He is imperceptible, impossible to grasp. We can attain only what enters our Kelim, our corrected properties. We comprehend only what comes from Him, what dresses onto our vessels, i.e., our properties consisting of the 10 Sefirot. Hence, whatever we perceive in the Creator we call the light, although it is a subjective sensation inside the corrected properties of our souls. The vessel feels that it exists independently, but this is an illusion. What can we understand about the Creator? We reveal our own cor- rected properties. According to what we call them, kindness, mercy, etc., we attribute these properties to the Creator. The purpose of creation, the degree of our unity with the Creator, lies in an absolute likeness to Him, in revealing all His greatness, eternity and perfection."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"75 Foreword ................................................................................................................. 7 6 Three Main Concepts in Kabbalah ........................................................................ 8 7 Five Levels of Masach ............................................................................................ 14 4 The Five Partzufim of the World Adam Kadmon ................................................ 17 3 The Weakening of the Masach for the Creation of the Partzuf ...........................

Overall, the Baal HaSulam wrote three forewords to the book of the Zohar: “The Foreword to the Book of Zohar” , “Preface to the Book of Zohar” and “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”. For an understanding of “The Book of Zohar”, we should know the entire structure of creation; how all the worlds are built, the laws of their functioning, how they influence the souls, and vice versa, how the souls affect the worlds, how the Creator governs the entire Universe, and how created beings influence His Providence. The purpose of studying Kabbalah is to feel the spiritual worlds and the scope of the Universe in their full measure; to experience sensa- tions beyond the power of birth and death; to transcend time; to reach in one of the incarnations a state such that man can live in all the worlds at the same time, completely merged with the Supreme force; to fully comprehend the Creator, - i.e., to attain the purpose of man’s existence in this world; and all while still living in this world. Kabbalah studies provide man with the answers to all of his ques- tions. He studies all cause-and-effect connections in this world; he stud- ies the Upper world from which everything descends to ours. The revela- tion of the Upper worlds happens constantly, gradually, and inside of man. Man creates within himself additional senses, more sensitive than his regular ones, which allow him to feel the additional forces of the Uni- verse, the part of it that is concealed from the common person. Kabbalah is called a secret wisdom, because only he who compre- hends, who feels the real picture of the Universe, it is only for him that this science becomes obvious. Because it educates man quite differently, Kabbalah has always been distinguished from common religion. It de- velops in him a sense of criticism, analysis, clear intuitive and conscious"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 77 research of himself and of his surroundings. Without these qualities, man can research neither this world, nor the Upper one. One can see how far apart Kabbalah stands from common religion by the fact that the greatest experts on religious laws and commandments in our world – many Rabbis and leaders of the religious masses, neither study nor know about Kabbalah. This ignorance in no way prevents them from physically observing the commandments or leading a religious life. It relates to the fact that Kabbalah speaks not about performing some- thing in action, but about the way to create the right intention “for the sake of the Creator”, which has nothing to do with common religion. Kabbalistic education is entirely individual and completely contra- dicts the education of the masses. A Kabbalist must be given the freedom of self-knowledge, the tools, the means with the help of which he can constantly develop. In no way should his inner development be limited. If man is given all kinds of instructions, he ceases to be free, for someone else’s model is imposed on his “self”. The Torah says “The knowledge (opinion) of the Torah is contrary to the knowledge (opinion) of the egoistic masses”. Hence, Kabbalists represent an entirely separate and autonomous group, though they were formally associated with the reli- gious community. During recent years, the general attitude toward Kabbalists has drastically changed. If during the previous centuries their books were burned and they were persecuted by the religious masses, today the situ- ation is different, and the religious world treats genuine Kabbalists with much more tolerance. There are spiritual reasons for that, since all that happens in our world is a consequence of the spiritual phenomena in the Upper worlds. We are at the end of the period of human development, on the eve of the whole of humanity's entering the spiritual world. There have never been so great a number of people taking an interest in Kabbalah. Today, Kabbalah studies are considered honorable and prestigious. All this shows that great changes have been sent from above."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 78 Just 200 years ago, during the period of the so-called Enlighten- ment ( Haskala ), there was a retreat from traditional religion. It was sent from above so that the same souls might later return to the Torah by themselves; not only to its general open part, but also to Kabbalah. Each generation consists of souls from previous generations dressed in new bodies. These souls descend into our world, accumulating experi- ence with each reincarnation. In addition, with time external spiritual conditions also change. 400 years ago, a great Kabbalist known as the Ari founded the modern Kabbalah. His writings are destined for the souls that began to descend to this world from his time onward. Since that period, a qualita- tive change in the souls descending to our world began. There appears an obvious striving for spirituality among them. Hence, the ban on Kab- balah studies was rescinded. In the Ari’s book “The Foreword to “The Gates of the Ascent”, he says that, from his time on, Kabbalah may be studied by anyone who has that desire. Today, a mass dissemination of Kabbalah should begin all over the world. The world has come to the moment when all spiritual roots have already descended from above; everything described in the Torah has al- ready happened in our world. There have already been exiles, destruc- tions. The only thing that has not yet happened is the attainment of spiri- tuality by the souls, the elevation of this world to the level of the spiritual one and merging of these two worlds. This process began in the twenties of the 20th century, and now it is gathering momentum like a snow-ball. By using the internet ( http://www.kabbalah.info ), we can see how the interest in Kabbalah is rapidly growing among those who until re- cently had nothing to do with it. People already understand that Kabbal- ah is not a teaching about some astrological-spiritual force. They begin clearly to realize that Kabbalah provides an understanding of the entire Universe. What are the forces governing the world? They realize that only this knowledge will save humankind from imminent disaster."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 79 People who cannot find satisfaction on this world's level come to Kabbalah, hoping to receive answers to their most vital questions. In the future, millions of people will study Kabbalah. Those who are studying today will teach it to the succeeding generations. In the process of man’s life, his intentions go through constant changes.They move from the animal-like desires to settle comfortably in this world, to benefit from everything, to the aspiration for knowledge, and then to spiritual elevation. We are built that way. Gradually, by studying Kabbalah, man changes his desires of this world to the higher, spiritual ones, to discover the spiritual world and enter it. Subsequently, man’s properties become altruistic. An egoistic ves- sel is very small and cannot include every pleasure prepared for us by the Creator. Therefore, by changing egoistic properties into altruistic ones, we infinitely expand the capacity of our vessel to receive all the spiritual information into it, to achieve a state of eternity and perfection. There is a mistaken opinion that the person who has comprehend- ed the spiritual, especially who has already reached a certain spiritual level, should appear as if he soars in the sky, and is “not of this world”, as if there are no negative qualities in him. Man ascends to the spiritual world internally to the extent of his “descent”, to the degree that he senses and understands his own egoism. Man ascends as his natural egoism is progressively revealed to him . By correcting it to a certain extent, man rises to a higher spiritual level, which corresponds to the measure of his correction. The higher a person becomes, he will possess increasingly greater egoistic properties. However, they receive correction. My Rabbi was a great Kabbalist. At the same time, he was able to be irritated or feel joy much more than any common human being. Egoism is the stuff we are made of. It was the only thing created by the Creator, and the entire Universe is made only of this egoistic mate-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 80 rial. We cannot correct egoism itself; we can only modify the way we use it. By being corrected, man does not cut off his egoistic Kli from himself. He changes the intention for which he applies it. A Kli with an altruistic intention is called spiritual. This Kli is a vessel of receiving pleasure and knowledge that changes, undergoes cor- rection, and grows in size during the process of spiritual development. A Kabbalist will not be recognized by his external appearances. All of them are energetic, purposeful people who neither give up this world, nor hide (except for special cases, when it is the Creator’s direct command). Many temptations lie in wait for a Kabbalist as he advances spiritually; many unforeseen troubles suddenly come his way. It is only upon reaching a higher level that he sees why he had been given all of his hardships. Nothing is done in vain; everything is given only for further spiritual advancement; whatever is sent to man on a certain level must be accepted by faith above reason. Note this well. A person who is ready to give up everything, who needs nothing, cannot move forward. While studying Kabbalah, man becomes more egoistic; all of his negative qualities become exposed. He seems rotten in his own eyes. This continues until he cannot bear his own properties anymore. Next, he is finally forced to cry out to the Creator for help. At this moment, he begs the Creator to rid him of his egoism and to replace it with altruism, for he clearly sees how much he loses because of his egoistic qualities. On the other hand, the one who does not feel it cannot see these negative qualities in himself. He cannot even believe that man is even able to come to making such requests. Hence, there is no urging or coer- cion in Kabbalah, only the method leading a disciple to the realization of his negative egoistic qualities by way of feeling how contrary he is to eternity and perfection. Only Kabbalah can lead man to transform his properties that they may come into agreement with the higher spiritual ones. There are two"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 81 parts to the Torah: the obvious, open part and the secret concealed one. The open part speaks about mechanically observing the commandments. It is called open because it is quite obvious how man fulfils it. This part of the Torah is studied and carried out by the masses. Therefore, a restriction is imposed on this part, “nothing to add and nothing to reduce”. For example, one must not add on more Tzitzit (frills on a ritual prayer shawl) to one’s clothes, or put one more Mezuzah (a box contain- ing an excerpt from the Holy Scriptures secured on the door-post of a Jewish home), or check the fitness of food with microscope, where one is instructed to check it with his naked eye and so on. Quite often, those who do not understand the essence of the Torah and its purpose in this world, concentrate more on mechanical performance. The second part of the Torah, the secret one, speaks about man’s intention ( Kavana ) in all his actions. Only this focused intention can change man’s action into its opposite, without suppression, by using his natural egoism. Since man’s intention is concealed from those around him, the part of the Torah that teaches the right intention is called the secret part, or Kabbalah. It instructs one how to receive everything pre- pared for him by the Creator. This part of the Torah encourages a constant increase of intention, so that the bigger it is, the more man attains the spiritual world. He feels the spiritual world to the extent of his intention, starting from the lowest level of the universe up to the complete intention on his entire true egoism – the highest level of the universe, a complete merging with the Creator. During the past 6000 years, various types of souls have descended to our world, from the purest in the first generations of the world, to the most corrupt ones of our time. For the correction of the first souls, even the Torah was not necessary. The very fact of their existence, their animal suffering already meant their correction. The process of accumu-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 82 lating suffering during the soul’s existence in a body of our world leads to the spiritual need (concealed from the soul) to enter the Upper world while still living in this one. However, the first souls did not accumulate enough sufferings to feel the necessity to give up their own egoism. Their primitive, animal way of thinking (insufficient Aviut ) could not generate in them the neces- sity of the spiritual elevation, did not push them towards the Creator. All the private emotional experiences, sufferings and knowledge of the descending souls are accumulated in a common spiritual vessel, a general soul called “ Adam ”. After two thousand years of accumulating this common experience, humankind felt the necessity for a mechanical, unconscious fulfillment of the commandments, while the rules of the spiritual world, which have no bearing on our world, are in no any way related to it. Consequently, to those who do not know their true spiritual ori- gin, they seem so odd. At this period, the Torah was given to human- kind, although only to a small group of people. In the next and the last two thousand-year period, a conscious desire for the spiritual and the necessity for self-correction begins to manifest. It becomes especially strong at the time of the great Kabbalist Ari and continues right up to our generation. The ultimate state of the entire universe is the Final Correction ( Gmar Tikkun ), where the lowest point of creation achieves the same state as the highest. The Creator at one stroke created this state. We are all in it already. Then why are we given the instruction for its attainment? It concerns the fact that we cannot feel our true state with our present egoistic desires. According to Kabbalah, if we do not evolve or correct our senses according to the instruction (“the Torah” derives from the word Ohra’a , instruction), we will be urged, compelled by force and suffering. The instruction is given for shortening the suffering period by increasing the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 83 speed of this rite of passage, making suffering different in character and substituting suffering of hatred for suffering of love. Why does the Creator need our suffering? He could have made the process of our spiritual growth painless. Of course, He could have. However, He wanted us to bear some kind of grievance against Him so that we might turn to Him for help, come into contact with Him, feel the necessity for Him. This connection with Him is the true purpose of the creation, while the correction is only a means to this end. The arising of the need for the Creator’s help, with regard to con- nection with Him, is possible only when we feel a real hunger for spiri- tual delight. The sensation of the lack of perfection must precede the feeling of perfection. Everything in the creation is comprehended only from its opposite state. First, a desire is created; only then can one sense pleasure from its fulfillment by the thing desired. We cannot feel our final, perfect condition at this time without preceding sufferings from the absence of this perfection. We all feel our present condition as imperfect due to the absence of corresponding corrected Kelim (desires). If we begin to correct them, then by each corrected Kli we will begin feeling part of a true perfect state. Moreover, once we correct all of our Kelim , we will feel complete perfection. In order to complete our correction, we must create in our- selves the possibility of feeling every nuance of perfection. This comprehensive process takes 6000 years, i.e., 6000 levels of correction which are called the period of the existence of this world, in other words, the period of feeling our imperfection. We all exist in bio- logical bodies in which “a biological computer is installed. Ours is more sophisticated than that of animal organisms because ours serves a larger egoism. This computer is our mind. It is no more than a mechanical calculator thatallows us to choose the best, most comfortable state for any given moment."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 84 This has nothing to do with spirituality. Spirituality begins when a “black point in the heart”, which is planted into man from above, begins striving after the Upper world. It should be developed to the state of a full spiritual desire -“the Partzuf ”, in which later one receives spiritual Partzuf ”, in whic h lat er one r eceiv es spiritual Partzuf information, spiritual sensations. If there is no such point in a person, he may be a genius, but ac- cording to the spiritual criteria, he remains no more than a highly devel- oped animal on the levels of the spiritual world. We stated that Kabbalah deals with the most important question in man’s life. We exist in an absolutely incomprehensible world, which we investigate with the help of our five senses. Whatever penetrates us from outside through these senses is processed in our mind, which syn- thesizes and presents us this information as a picture of the world. There- fore, what seems to us to be the surrounding reality is no more than our unimproved senses’ interpretation of the outer light. In fact, this is only a fragment of the universe. It means that what we perceive is a tiny part of what surrounds us. If we had different senses, we would perceive another fragment, i.e., we would sense this world dif- ferently. It would seem to us that the world around us has changed, while in fact all changes occur in us, in our perceptions, while the world wouldremain the same. This is because, outside of us, only the Creator’s simple, Upper Light exists. We sense how our organism reacts to outside influences. Every- thing depends on the sensitivity of our organs. If they were more sensi- tive, we would feel how atoms strike our bodies. We would comprehend, feel, perceive not the objects themselves, but their interaction; not their essence, but their outer form and material. Similarly, no device invented by us can register an action in itself; only the reaction to it. Anything we might like to know about our world, in order to un- derstand the meaning of our existence in it, depends on the framework of our comprehension, on the kind of questions we ask. Our nature,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 85 our innate qualities, dictates to us the level of our intellectual curiosity. The Creator, having programmed our properties, somehow dictates to us from inside what to take interest in, what to research, what to com- prehend, what to discover. Ultimately though, the Creator leads us to revealing Himself. The various sciences that deal with humans reveal only matters about man himself. All that is outside of man remains inaccessible. Therefore, the question about the meaning of our life cannot be solved with the help of science because the sciences do not discover anything outside of us, only what is in connection with us, with our senses, with our devices, with our reactions and those of our devices that communi- cate with the outer world. The most global human questions, birth, the meaning of life and death, can be solved only by comprehending what is outside of us; not by discovering and researching our reactions to the outer world, but by objective knowledge concerning the outer world. This is exactly what is inaccessible to scientific research. Only when man enters the spiritual world, does he receive the gift of comprehending objective reality; how and what truly exists outside of him. There is a method with whose help one can receive complete infor- mation about the entire universe; i.e., what exists beyond the bounds of human sensations and feelings, what is happening outside of oneself. This method is called Kabbalah. The one who masters it is called a Kabbalist. This is a very special, ancient method. It was created by people who, while living in our world, managed to sense the spiritual worlds and pass their sensations on to us. The Kabbalistic method that they used throughout the centuries was described with more and more me- ticulousness, taking into consideration the properties of the generation for which it was meant. It went this way until its arrival in the form we are able to study today. This is the result of five thousand years of spiri- tual development."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 86 Each succeeding generation of Kabbalists, guided by previous ex- perience, worked on developing a method of mastering the spiritual, outer world, suitable for their generation. The textbooks they used for studying Kabbalah 2-3 thousand years ago, or even 400-500 years ago, are of no good use to us. We can use them only in a very limited capac- ity. The last great Kabbalist who adapted Kabbalah for the use of our generation was Rabbi Yehuda Leib Alevi Ashlag (1885-1955). He wrote the commentary to The Book of the Zohar and to the books of the Ari. His 6-volume textbook, “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”, is the principal work on Kabbalah and is the only practical instruction for us to master spirituality. To help the beginners studying this fundamental work, Rabbi Y. Ashlag wrote “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”, which is a concise summary of what is written in “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”. It provides an understanding of the structure of the universe,slightly lifting the veil for the attainment of this goal and explains the role of our world in grasping the entire universe."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 87 T H R E E M A I N C O N C E P T S I N K A B B A L A H חכמה של יסודות ' ג תורה להם הרבה לפיכך , ישראל את לזכות ה \" הקב רצה : אומר עקשיא בן חנניא רבי \" ( א הוא שזכות ונודע .( ב \" ע ג \" כ מכות ) \" ויאדיר תורה יגדיל צדקו למען חפץ ' ה שנאמר , ומצות ר \" ב ) \" ישראל את בהן לצרף אלא מצות נתנו לא \" ל \" ז שאמרו ד \" ע והוא . הזדככות מלשון , שבנו העביות מהי וכן . ומצות תורה י \" ע משיגים שאנו , הזה הזכות ענין להבין ויש .( ד \" רפמ . ומצות התורה י \" ע לזכותה צריכים שאנו כי , בקיצור כאן ונחזור .\" הספירות עשר תלמוד \" ו \" מסבירות פנים \" בספרי מזה דברנו וכבר הוטבע ומכאן .' וית ' ית הרחבה ידו מתנת כפי , לנבראים להנות כדי היתה הבריאה מחשבת התענוג מדת על הכלי הוא לקבל הרצון כי .' ית שפעו את לקבל גדול וחשק רצון בהנשמות . שבהשפע . שבשפע והחמדה התענוג מדת הוא כן , השפע את לקבל הרצון של ותוקפו גדלו מדת לפי כי שהתענוג , בהיחס זולת . ביניהם לחלק שאין עד , בזה זה מקושרים והם . יותר ולא פחות לא אלה ' ב ובהכרח . המקבל לנברא מיוחס השפע את לקבל הגדול והרצון , להשפע מיוחס , הנזכר דרך על בהם לחלק שיש אלא . הבריאה במחשבת בהכרח ובאו .' ית מהבורא נמשכים הוא , שם הכלול לקבל והרצון , מיש יש נמשך שהוא כלומר ,' ית מעצמותו הוא השפע אשר בעצמותו כי . מאין יש יציאת שפירושו , חידוש של השורש הוא כלומר , הנבראים של השורש של חומר כל הוא , האמור לקבל שהרצון נבחן כ \" וע . ו \" ח לקבל הרצון בחינת שם שאין ודאי ' ית ודרכי , שיעור להן שאין , ומקריהן המרובות הבריות מיני שכל עד . סופה עד מראשה , הבריאה . לקבל הרצון של ערכים ושינוי שיעורים רק אינם , להתגלות והעתידים נתגלו שכבר , הנהגתן הוא זה כל , בהן המוטבע לקבל ברצון שמקובל מה כל דהיינו , הבריות באותן בהן שיש מה וכל מחודש אינו כי , מאין יש המחודשת הבריאה מבחינת כלום ואינו , מיש יש ' ית מעצמותו נמשך . מיש יש ' ית מנצחיותו נמשך והוא . כלל 1) Rabbi Hanania ben Akashia said, “The Creator wished to re- ward Israel, so He gave them the Torah and the Commandments...” In Hebrew “to award” (“Lizkot”) is similar to the word “to purify” (“Lezakot”). Midrash “Bereshit Rabbah” says, “The Command- ments are given only to purify Israel with their help”. Here two ques- tions arise: -What is the privilege that the Creator awarded to Israel? -What is this “impurity” and “coarseness” that is in us and from which we have to purify ourselves with the help of the Torah and the Commandments?"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 88 These matters have been discussed in my books “Panim Meirot uMas- birot” and “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”. Let us review them briefly. The Creator’s intention was to give pleasure to created beings. For this, He prepared an enormous desire in the souls to receive this plea- sure contained in the Shefa (the abundance which the Creator wants to bestow upon us). The “desire to receive” is a vessel for the reception of the delight contained in the Shefa. The greater the “desire to receive”, the more pleasure enters the vessel. These two notions interconnect in such a way that it is impossible to separate them. It is only possible to point out that the pleasure refers to the Shefa (i.e., to the Creator) while the “desire to receive” refers to the Cre- ation. Both of these notions come directly from the Creator and are in- cluded in the Thought of Creation. While the abundance descends directly from the Creator, the “desire to receive” it, also included in the Shefa, is the root, the source of created beings. The “desire to receive” is something essentially new, something that never existed before, because there is no trace of “desire to receive” in the Creator. It turns out that the “desire to receive” is the essence of the creation, from beginning to end, the only “material” the creation is made of. All of the various created beings are merely different “por- tions” of the “desire to receive”. Moreover, all events that happen to them are the changes that happen to this “desire to receive”. Everything that fills the created beings and satisfies their “desire to receive” comes directly from the Creator. Therefore, everything that exists around us actually comes out of the Creator, either directly as abundance, or indirectly as, for example, the “desire to receive”, that does not exist in the Creator Himself, but was created by Him for delighting His creatures."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 89 Since the Creator’s desire was to bestow upon the created beings, He had to create someone capable of receiving his abundance. Conse- quently, He integrated into the Creation the desire to receive pleasure. Why? There is a rule: the Creator created everything that exists in our nature. The question “Why did we receive such nature?” refers to the state of being prior to the beginning of the Creation and is beyond our grasp. We are able only to attain that which refers to the Creation, but not before or after it. Therefore, our nature allows us to receive only the pleasure that is in equilibrium with our desire for it. For example, if a man is hungry he enjoys the meal; whereas, if he is offered food while not being hungry, he derives no pleasure. Every- thing is a combination of a deficiency and the filling of it. The stronger the desire, the greater is the pleasure from filling it. , שבו ערכים ריבוי בכל , הבריאה במחשבת תכף בהכרח לקבל הרצון כלול , האמור וכפי ( ב מבחינים שאנו , וכלי אור ס \" שז ותדע . ולהעניקם להנותם שחשב הגדול השפע עם ביחד . למדרגה ממדרגה יחד ומשתלשלים , יחד כרוכים בהכרח באים הם כי . עליונים בעולמות ההתגשמות שיעור הוא כן ,' ית ממנו ומתרחקות פניו אור מאת יורדות שהמדרגות ובשיעור הרצון של התגשמות שיעור כפי אשר , להיפך לומר אפשר וכן . בשפע הכלול לקבל הרצון של לקבל שהרצון דהיינו , מכולם הנמוך המקום עד . למדרגה ממדרגה ויורד הולך כן , בשפע לקבל . הראוי שיעורו בכל שם מתגשם והשפע .\" אדם של גופו \" לבחינת נבחן לקבל והרצון .\" העשיה עולם \" בשם ההוא המקום נבחן , באופן . ז \" שבעוה בריות בשאר גם ז \" ועד . ההוא \" שבגוף החיים \" של תוכנו למדת נבחן שמקבל ' ית בשפעו הכלול לקבל שהרצון עוד כל כי , הוא ז \" לעוה העליונים העולמות שבין ההבחן שכל ואחר , ז \" מעוה העליונים , הרוחנים בעולמות נמצא שעודו נבחן , הסופית בצורתו נתגשם לא . ז \" בעוה מצוי הוא שכבר נבחן הוא , הסופית בצורתו נתגשם לקבל שהרצון 2) Therefore, the “desire to receive” in all its variety was included in the Thought of Creation from the very beginning. It was inseparably linked to the delight that the Creator prepared for us. The “desire to receive” is a vessel, while the Shefa is the light that fills the ves- sel. These lights and vessels are the only components of the spiritual worlds. They are inseparably connected to one another. Together they descend from above, level by level."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 90 The farther away from the Creator these levels are, the greater and coarser the “desire to receive” becomes. On the other hand, the greater and coarser the “desire to receive” becomes, the more remote it is from the Creator. This happens until it comes to the lowest point where the “desire to receive” reaches its maximum size. This condition is desirable and necessary for the beginning of the ascension toward the correction. This place is called “the world of Assiya”. In this world the “desire to receive” is defined as “man’s body”, while the light is called “man’s life”. The difference between the Upper worlds and this world (Olam Hazeh) is that in the Upper worlds the “desire to receive” is not yet coarse enough, and is not yet separated completely from the light. In our world, the “desire to receive” reaches its final development and becomes completely separated from the light. הוא , ז \" שבעוה הסופית צורתו על לקבל הרצון את להביא עד האמור השתלשלות וסדר ( ג כוללות ' ית שבשמו ה \" הוי אותיות ' ד כי .' ד בן השם של אותיות ' בד שיש בחינות ' ד סדר על מתבארות הן הכלל ומבחינת . המשהו מן משהו אף ממנה יוצא מבלי , כולה המציאות כל את כוללת התפארת ספירת כי , ספירות עשר והם . ושרשם , מלכות , ת \" ת , בינה , חכמה : ס \" בהע . י \" נה ת \" חג הנקראות , ספירות ששה בעצמה , אצילות : הנקראות עולמות ' ד והן . מ \" תו ב \" חו נקראים הם בעיקרם אמנם . כתר נקרא והשורש , ז \" בעוה בריה לך שאין , באופן . ז \" עוה את גם בתוכו כולל העשיה ועולם . עשיה , יצירה , בריאה . לנבראיו להנות בכדי שהיא , הבריאה במחשבת דהיינו , ה \" ב ס \" מא מחודשת תהיה שלא את לקבל רצון בחינת עם שפע של שיעור מאיזה , כלומר . וכלי מאור תיכף כלולה בהכרח והיא הוא השפע לקבל והרצון , מיש יש ' ית מעצמותו נמשך הוא השפע שיעור אשר . ההוא השפע להשתלשל מחויב הוא , הסופית תכונתו על יבא ההוא לקבל שהרצון ובכדי . מאין יש מחודש , וכלי באור הבריה נגמרת ואז . עשיה , יצירה , בריאה , אצילות עולמות ' הד דרך שבו השפע עם . שבו \" החיים אור \" ו \" גוף \" הנקרא 3) The above-mentioned descending order of the development of the “desire to receive” is divided into four levels (Behinot). This order is encoded in the mystery of the Creator’s Name. The Universe sub- mits to the order of these four letters, HaVaYaH (Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey). These letters correspond to the ten Sefirot: Hochma, Bina, Tifferet"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 91 (or Zeir Anpin), Malchut and their root. Why are there ten? It is be- cause the Sefira Tifferet includes 6 Sefirot: Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod and Yesod. The root of all these Sefirot is called Keter, but often it is not included in the Sefirot count; hence, one says HuB-TuM. These four Behinot correspond to the four worlds: Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya. The world of Assiya also includes this world (“Olam Hazeh”). There is no single created being in this world whose root is not in the world of Infinity, in the plan of the creation. The plan of the creation is the Creator’s desire to please all the created beings. It includes both the light and the vessel. The light comes directly from the Creator, while the desire to receive pleasure was created by the Creator anew out of nothing. For the “desire to receive” to reach its final development, it must pass together with the light through the four worlds of Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya (ABYA). Then the development of the creation is completed with the creation in it of the light and the vessel, called “the body” and “the light of Life”. The connection between the Creator and the creation is called “the world of Infinity” (the Ein Sof ). Lower spiritual objects as they com- Ein Sof ). Lo w er spiritual objects as the y com- Ein Sof prehend it give the names of the Upper Light. Since the Creator’s desire was to bestow pleasure upon the created beings, He created someone who would be able to receive this pleasure from Him, and the creation of the desire to receive pleasure called “ Malchut ” or “the world of Infinity” was sufficient for that. Since in this state Malchut , receives for its own sake, making no restriction on reception, Malchut later performs a restriction on the re- ception of the light-pleasure. It is said that the “desire to receive” was finalized in the world of Assiya . So does it mean that the biggest “desire to receive” exists in this world of Assiya ? Yet, while the world of Assiya is only Behinat Shoresh and"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 92 has the weakest light, there is the light of Keter in the world of A”K.The Keter in the w orld of A ”K.The Keter notion the world of Assiya has two meanings: a) The entire Behina Dalet is called the world of Assiya . b) The world of Assiya by itself. To understand the meaning of the first notion one needs to know that the finished vessel is called “ Behina Dalet ”; but, in fact the true ves- sel (the Kli ) is already present in Behina Aleph . Keter is “the “desire to Keter is “the “desir e t o Keter bestow” pleasure upon the creation”; Hochma is “the “desire to receive” this pleasure” and is completely filled with the light. Nevertheless, the Kli should pass four more levels to its final development. We study everything from the point of view of our nature because all laws come out of the spiritual roots. In our world, the value of man’s pleasure depends on the force of his striving for it. Unbearable passion brings great pleasure, while a tiny desire leads to small pleasure. For man to grasp a true desire, two conditions are necessary: a) Man cannot strive for something that he has never heard of before. He has to know what he wants, i.e., once he has already had it. b) But he cannot be striving for something he already has. There- fore four levels of development of the Kli are necessary for it to receive the final form. Malchut had the entire light in the world of Infinity. However, the vessel is characterized by the difference of its properties from those of the Creator, which did not exist in the world of Infinity. With the following development of the vessel, we realize that the true vessel is the lack of the light. In the world of Assiya, the Kli does not receive anything at all, because it wants only to receive; hence, it is defined as a genuine vessel. It is so far from the Creator that it knows nothing about its root. As a result, man has to believe that he is created by the Creator, although he is unable to feel it."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 93 Conclusion: the vessel is not someone or something that has a lot; on the contrary, it is someone or something extremely remote. It is total- ly disconnected from the light. While receiving only for its own sake, the vessel has no “desire to give”; all it can do is to believe that such desire exists... Man just cannot understand why he has to strive for giving. What is the point of existence for such a vessel that has no spark of the light and is extremely remote from the Creator? Such vessels have to begin working for the sake of bestowal with objects that are, so far, unreal. The Baal HaSulam gives the following example. In the past, every- thing was very expensive, so children were taught to write first on the blackboard with a piece of chalk. Then they could erase what they had mistakenly written, and only those who had learned to write correctly were given real paper. The same is true with us. First, we are given playthings, and then, if we learn to add the intention for the Creator’s sake to our desire, we will be able to see the true light. The Kli is created in such a way as to get used to the real work. Before the souls appear all actions are performed by the Creator. By this He shows the souls how they should act. For example, how does one learn to play chess? The moves are made for the pupil and in this way, he learns. That is why the worlds descend from above. The Creator carries out all the actions relating both to the higher levels and to the lower ones. Then at the second stage, the souls begin to ascend by themselves. Meanwhile, we strive for playthings and not for spirituality; hence, the light of the Torah is concealed from us. Man would not be able to receive the enormous delights offered to him for the Creator’s sake. The Baal HaSulam gives us an example. A man puts all of his valu- ables on the table – gold, silver, diamonds. Suddenly, strangers come to his house.He fears they may steal his treasures. What can he do? He"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 94 switches off the light so that no one can see that there are precious things in the house. We do not lack the desire for spirituality because the “desire to re- ceive” is absent in us; rather, because we cannot see anything.We cannot see the wood for the trees. The more man “purifies himself”, the better he begins to see. Then his Kli (the “desire to receive”) gradually grows, for he wants to feel greater pleasures. For example, if one manages to receive 0.5 kg of pleasure for the sake of bestowal, he is given 1kg. Then, if that amount was also received with the intention for the Creator’ sake, he is given 2 kg of pleasure, and so on. The sages said about it: “He who has reached higher levels of Torah has bigger desires.” Yet we cannot see anything until our desires acquire the intention to receive for the sake of bestowal. In this sense, the only distinction between a secular and religious person is that the former aspires to receive only the pleasures of this world, while the latter also desires the delight of the world to come. The power of the desire to receive over all created beings is so great that the sages said about it, “The law ruling over people is this: Mine is mine, and yours is yours; and only fear stops man from saying, ‘Yours is mine’.” כלל שיש מפני הוא , ע \" שבאבי האמורות בחינות ' ד על לקבל הרצון להשתלשלות והצורך ( ד . לתפקידו רצוי הכלי את עושה הוא והסתלקותו האור התפשטות אשר , הכלים בענין גדול כנר אליו ובטל \" האור עם נכלל הוא הרי , שלו מהאור פעם נפרד לא שהכלי עוד כל כי , פרוש .\" האבוקה בפני הוא האור כי . הקצה אל מקצה הרחוקה ביניהם הפכיות שיש מפני , הוא הזה הביטול וענין , להשפיע כולו הוא ' ית ס \" שבא הבריאה מחשבת ומבחינת . מיש יש ' ית מעצמותו הנמשך שפע . משהו אף לקבל רצון מבחינת בו ואין הנברא של שורשו כל שהוא , ההוא השפע את לקבל הגדול הרצון שהוא , הכלי הוא אליו והפכי מתבטל , יחד בזה זה כרוכים בהיותם ולפיכך . כלום השפעה של ענין בו אין הנה . המחודש פעם ממנו האור הסתלקות אחר אלא , צורתו את לקבוע יכול ואינו , שבו באור לקבל הרצון הזאת והשתוקקות . אחריו מאד להשתוקק מתחיל הוא , ממנו האור הסתלקות אחר כי . אחת"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 95 נבחן הוא , בו ומתלבש חוזר כשהאור , ז \" ואח . כראוי לקבל הרצון צורת את ומחליטה קובעת . עמוק מכל עמוק הוא כי , עיניך כאן ושים . וחיים גוף או , ואור כלי : נבדלים ענינים ' לב מעתה 4) The necessity to develop the “desire to receive” on four levels (Be- hinot) through the four worlds of ABYA is caused by the existing rule, according to which only the spreading of the light followed by its subsequent expulsion make the vessel fit for use. An explanation: when the vessel is filled with the light, they are inseparably connected. The vessel is in fact non-existent; it abolishes itself as the flame of a candle disappears in the flame of a torch. The desire is satisfied, so it ceases to exist. It can reappear only after the light exits from it, stops filling it. The reason for this self-annihi- lation of the vessel lies in its total contrast with the light. The light comes directly from the Creator’s essence, from the Thought of Cre- ation. This light is a “desire to bestow” and has nothing to do with a “desire to receive”. The vessel is absolutely opposite to it; it is a huge “desire to receive” the light. The vessel is a root, a source of something very new, non-existent before the creation. The vessel has no “desire to give”. Since the light and the vessel are inseparably connected, the “desire to receive” is an- nulled by the light. The vessel acquires a certain form only after the expulsion of the light from it. Only then, the vessel starts craving for the light. This passionate desire determines the necessary form of 'his “desire to receive”. When the light reenters the vessel, they become two separate objects – the vessel and the light, or body and life. Take a good note of it, because these are most profound notions. When the Kli begins to receive, it must feel: “Now I receive plea- sure”. But the light carrying that pleasure does not let this ”I” open and be felt by the Kli . Hence, the “I” annuls itself. It means that the Kli does not feel that it receives, although it does so."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 96 Rabbi Baruch Ashlag gives this example. An old man won $100.000 in a lottery. His friends were afraid to tell him the news, thinking he might have a heart attack and die of over-excitement. One of them said he could pass the information without causing any harm. He came to the old man and asked him, “Would you share $10 with me if you won in the lottery?” - “Of course I would!”, answered the old man. “And if you won $100, would you still be willing to share the prize with me?” “Why not?” answered the old man. It went on and on until the sum reached $100.000, then the guest asked, “Are you ready to sign our agreement?” – “I certainly am!” – exclaimed the old man. At that very moment the guest collapsed on the floor and died. We see that man can die of great joy, since too powerful a light annuls the “desire to receive”. In such a case, the Kli disappears and the light is bound to exit to encourage the Kli to strive after it. Why then does the light not annul the Kli , the Behina Dalet, upon returning to it? When the Ohr and Ohr and Ohr Kli are together in the Behina Aleph , both the “desire to bestow” and the “desire to receive” must spread there. However, since they are opposite to one another, the “desire to bestow” annuls the “desire to receive”, i.e., prevents it from spreading. After the Behina Dalet was formed, the light cannot annul it, since they represent two existing forces. In the Behina Aleph the light does not let the “desire to receive” spread and grow; but once it has developed, it cannot interfere with it. For example, two men are fighting. One of them prevents the oth- er from entering his house. Does it matter if they are fighting outside or the intruder is already inside? If we say that, nothing exists but the Creator, who wishes to bestow pleasure and the creation that strives af- ter this pleasure, it is sufficient to have Keter as a giver and Keter as a giv er and Keter Hochma as a receiver! In the phase of Hochma the “desire to receive” is one with the light, the latter preventing it from feeling as it receives. This state is not perfect"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 97 though, since the Kli must feel that it receives. For instance, man gives something to his friend, but he cannot feel it. In this case the giver vio- lates the commandment, “do not destroy”. Hence, it is clear why we are not given important (precious) things. Since we are quite content with scanty pleasures, we are not worthy to be given valuable things. Therefore, the development of 4 phases is neces- sary for the birth of the Kli, which feels as it receives. , א \" בחי כי . מלכות ת \" ת בינה חכמה הנקראות , ה \" הוי שבשם בחינות ' לד צריכים ולפיכך ( ה עם הגדול לקבל הרצון בו כי . וכלי אור , הנאצל של כללותו כל באמת היא , חכמה הנקראת שבהנאצל החיים אור כל הוא כי , החיה אור או החכמה אור הנקרא , שבו האור כללות כל . שלו בהכלי המלובש עם מעורב הוא כי , ניכר שאינו כמעט שבה והכלי , אור לכלו נבחנת הזו ' הא בחינה אמנם הוא בסופו החכמה כלי כי , והוא . ב \" בחי באה ואחריה . האבוקה בפני כנר בו ובטל האור , המאציל אל להשפיע רצון בו שמתעורר דהיינו . שבו העליון לאור הצורה בהשואת מתגבר . להשפיע כולו שהוא , שבתוכו האור כטבע .\" חסדים אור \" הנקרא , חדש אור מהמאציל אליו נמשך , בו שנתעורר הזה הרצון י \" ע ואז החכמה אור אין כי . המאציל בו שהשפיע , החכמה מאור לגמרי שנפרש כמעט זה ומשום ב \" שבבחי וכלי שהאור , באופן . שיעורו בכל הגדול לקבל הרצון שהוא , שלו בהכלי רק מקובל , החסדים לאור נבחן שבה והאור , להשפיע הרצון הוא שבה הכלי כי . א '' מבחי לגמרי משונים השואת לו גורם להשפיע הרצון כי . בהמאציל הנאצל של הדבקות מכח הנמשך אור שפירושו . דבקות הוא ברוחניות הצורה והשואת . למאציל הצורה בלי חסדים אור לבחינת שבהנאצל האור שנתמעט אחר כי והוא .' ג בחינה באה ואחריה התעוררה בסופה ב \" הבחי כ \" ע , הנאצל של חיותו עיקר הוא החכמה שאור ונודע , כלל חכמה הזו התעוררות והנה . שבה החסדים אור תוך להאיר , החכמה מאור שיעור בקרבה והמשיכה . ת \" ת או ' ג בחינה הנקרא , חדש כלי צורת שהוא , לקבל מהרצון מסוים שיעור מחדש המשיכה , חסדים אור הוא הזה האור עיקר כי .\" חכמה בהארת חסדים אור \" נקרא שבה האור ובחינת . חכמה אור הוא ומיעוטו , במילואו חכמה אור להמשיך התעורר בסופו ג \" דבחי הכלי גם כי והוא .' ד בחינה באה ואחריה לקבל הרצון בשיעור , השתוקקות בחינת היא הזו התעוררות ונמצא . א \" בבחי שהיה כמו אלא , בו מלובש החכמה אור אין עתה כי . ההוא מאור נפרד כבר עתה כי . עליו ונוסף א \" שבבחי האור התפשטות אחר כי . שלימותו כל על לקבל הרצון צורת נקבע כ \" ע . אחריו שמשתוקק מוקדם הכלי נמצא , האור את בחזרה ויקבל כ \" אח וכשיחזור . הכלי נקבע , משם והסתלקותו .\" מלכות \" נקראת והיא . כלי לגמר הזאת ' ד בחינה נבחנת כ \" וע . להאור"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 98 5) As stated above, the creation develops according to four phases, Behinot, encoded in the name HaVaYaH and called Hochma, Bina, Tifferet and Malchut. Behina Aleph (1) is called “Hochma”, which contains both the light and the vessel made of the “desire to receive”. This vessel contains the entire light called Ohr Hochma (the light of wisdom) Ohr Haya (the light of life), because it is the entire light of life inside the creation. Nevertheless, Behina Aleph is still regarded as the light and the vessel in it has not manifested yet, existing potentially. It is still inseparably connected with the light in the state of self-abolishment. Afterwards, Behina Bet (2) comes into being, because by the end of its develop- ment Hochma wished to acquire the equivalence of properties with the light that is inside it. The “desire to bestow” upon the Creator has awakened in it. The nature of the light is a pure “desire to give”. As an answer to the awakening of that desire, the Creator sent a new and different light called “Ohr Hassadim” (the light of mercy). Hence, Behina Aleph almost completely got rid of Ohr Hochma, given by the Creator. Ohr Hochma may only be present in the proper vessel, i.e., the “desire to receive”. Both the light and the vessel in Behina Bet are totally differ- ent from those in Behina Aleph, since the vessel in Behina Bet is the “desire to bestow” and the light is Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hassadim is the pleasure of being like the Creator. The “desire to bestow” leads to the equivalence of properties with the Creator that, in the spiritual worlds, leads to merging with him. Then Behina Gimel emerges. After the light inside the creation pass- es to the level of Ohr Hassadim in the almost complete absence of Ohr Hochma ( as we know Ohr Hochma is the principal life force in the creation), Behina Bet felt its deficiency. At the end of its develop- ment, it attracted a portion of the Ohr Hochma so that it could start shining inside its Ohr Hassadim."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 99 To this end, it reawakened a portion of its inner desire to receive and formed a new vessel called Behina Gimel, or Tifferet. The light inside it is Ohr Hassadim with the luminescence of Ohr Hochma because the main part of this light is Ohr Hassadim, Ohr Hochma being less significant. Behina Dalet follows it because the vessel of Behina Gimel also wished to attract Ohr Hochma at the end of its development, but this time it wanted all of it, as it had been in Behina Alef. It turns out that this awakened desire leads to a situation where Be- hina Dalet feels the passionate desire that Behina Aleph had. More- over, now, after expelling the light once, the creation knows how bad it feels, so it desires this light much more than at the earlier stage of Behina Aleph. Therefore, the emanation of the light and its subsequent expulsion create a vessel. If the vessel now receives the light again, it will pre- cede the light. Therefore, the Behina Dalet is a final phase in the creation of the vessel called Malchut. Why did the light itself become a reason for the Kli’s wish to give? We observe a law in our nature: each branch longs to be like its root. That is why, as soon as the light of Hochma came, the Kli received it. However, when it felt that the light had come from the Giver, it wished to be like the Source and not to receive. It means that two actions come out of Keter : a) the desire to bestow pleasure upon the creation, which created the “desire to receive”, and it is Behina Aleph. b) the desire to bestow acts in the creation, because the latter feels that the light it receives comes from the desire of the superior giver, and thusalso wants to give. We can see an example of this in the material world. One person gives another a present, and the latter receives it. Then he begins to think and understands: “He is a giver and I am a receiver! I should not take it!” That is why he returns the gift. At the beginning when he received the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 100 present, he was under the giver’s influence and did not feel he was a re- ceiver. However, after the reception he began to feel that he is a receiver, which made him decline the present. It is necessary to point out that this person has a “desire to receive”, because he did receive the present at the beginning. But he did not ask for it! Hence, it is not called a Kli . The Kli is a state in which one feels that there is pleasure, begs, and pleads to the giver to give it to him. Why is Bina’s Aviut bigger than that of Hochma , i.e., why does it have a bigger “desire to receive”, but wishes only to give? Hochma is the vessel that does not yet feel that it receives; the giver controls it completely. Nevertheless, Bina already feels itself as a receiver; therefore, its Aviut is bigger . There are two kinds of light: a) The light of the Purpose of the creation called “ Ohr Hochma ” comes from the Creator (the “desire to bestow” upon the cre- ation); it is Behina Aleph . b) The light of the Correction of the creation called “ Ohr Hassad- im” , which spreads thanks to the creation; it is termed Behina Bet . How can one say that Ohr Hassadim spreads thanks to the creation? Is not the Creator the source of the light and pleasure? It is because the Creator’s pleasure comes to the creation owing to its merging with the Source of pleasure. The beginning of the Creation happens as follows: The light comes out of the Creator, the Ohr - pleasure. This emana- Ohr - pleasur e. This emana- Ohr tion of the light from the Creator is called the zero phase (0), or the root ( Shoresh ). The light creates the Kli , which is able to feel, absorb all pleasure contained in the light. Let us assume that the Creator wanted to give the creation 1kg of pleasure. In that case, He should have created the “desire to receive” that pleasure ( Kli) with the capacity of 1kg, which could ab- sorb the entire delight."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 101 Such a state of the Kli's being completely filled with the Creator’s light is called phase Aleph (1). This phase is characterized by the desire to receive pleasure. The light, carrying the pleasure is called “ Ohr Hochma ”. The Kli in this phase receives the Ohr Hochma ; hence, the phase itself is called “Hochma”. The Kli receives the Creator’s light, feels absolute pleasure and ac- quires its property - the “desire to give”, to please. As a result, instead of receiving, the Kli now desires to give, and stops receiving the light. Since a new desire, contrary to the initial one appears in the Kli , it passes to a new state, which is called phase Bet (2), the “desire to give”, or Bina . The Kli has stopped receiving the light. The light continues to in- teract with the Kli and says to it, that by refusing to receive the light, it neither fulfils the Purpose of the creation, nor the Creator’s desire. The Kli analyses this information and comes to a conclusion that it really does not fulfill the Creator’s desire. What is more, the Kli feels the light is a vital force, and that it cannot do without it. Hence, the Kli , still willing to give, decides to start receiving an essential portion of the light. It turns out that the Kli agrees to receive the light for two reasons: first, because it wants to fulfill the Creator’s desire, this reason being the main one; and secondly, it feels that it really cannot exist without the light. The appearance of a new, though, a tiny “desire to receive” the light in the Kli , creates a new phase that is called Behina Gimel (3), or Zeir Anpin . While simultaneously giving and receiving a little in phase Gimel , the Kli begins to realize that the Creator’s desire is to fill completely the Kli with the light so it might be able to enjoy it infinitely. Since the Kli has already acquired a little bit of the light of Hochma necessary for its existence, it now decides to receive the rest of the light. This is the Creator’s desire, and the Kli resumes receiving the Creator’s light the way it did in phase 1."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 102 The new phase is called Behina Dalet (4). It differs from phase 1, in that it independently expressed its “desire to receive”. The first phase was unconsciously filled with the light by the Cre- ator’s desire. It had no desire of its own. The 4th phase is called “the kingdom of desires”, or Malchut. This state, Malchut, is called “the world of Infinity’ (the Olam Ein Sof ) - infinite, unlimited desire to receive plea- Olam Ein Sof ) - inf init e, unlimit ed desir e t o r eceiv e plea- Olam Ein Sof sure, to be filled with the light. Behinat Shoresh (0) is the Creator’s desire to create the creation and give it maximum pleasure. In this phase, as in a seed, or embryo, all sub- sequent creation is included from its beginning to the end, encompass- ing the Creator’s attitude to the future creation. Behinat Shoresh (0) is the Thought of the entire creation. All subse- quent processes are only the realization of this Thought. Each subsequent phase is the logical consequence of the previous one. The development goes on from above and each preceding phase is “higher” than the fol- lowing one, i.e., the preceding phase includes all the subsequent ones. In the course of this development from the Creator down to our world, new levels come into being; everything evolving from perfect to imperfect. The Creator created the light, the pleasure, out of Himself, out of his Essence. Hence, it is said that the light is created “ Yesh mi Yesh ” (existent out of existent), i.e., that the light has existed forever. However, with the appearance of phase 1 of the desire to receive pleasure, the ves- sel, the Kli, is called “ Yesh mi Ayn ” (existent out of non-existent), i.e., the Creator made it out of nothing; because there cannot be even the slight- est “desire to receive” in the Creator. The creation’s first independent desire occurs in phase two. In this phase, the “desire to bestow” appears for the first time. This desire ap- peared under the influence of the light, which was received from the Creator, and had already been included in the Thought of Creation. However, the Kli feels it as its own, independent desire. The same is true of our desires: all of them are sent from above, from the Creator; but we consider them to be our own."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 103 By feeling the “desire to give” in phase two, contrary to the “desire to receive”, the Kli ceases to feel pleasure from receiving, stops sensing the light as pleasure. The light filters out and leaves it remaining empty. In phase one, the desire to receive pleasure was created. It is the only desire that is absent in the Creator. This very desire is the creation. Subsequently, there are only variations of this desire of phase 1 in the entire Universe; the desire to receive pleasure either from receiving or from giving, or from the combination of these two desires. Apart from the Creator there is only one thing – the desire to receive pleasure. The vessel (the Kli ) always wants to receive. The material it is made of does not change. Man can understand it only when he realizes the evil and comprehends his egoistic nature. All that is incorporated into our nature; in every cell of our body, there is no more than the desire to receive pleasure. Phase two, now empty, stops feeling that it exists; it is created by the light and being without it, feels like dying. Hence, it desires to receive at least a little bit of the Creator’s light. The pleasure from receiving the light is called “Ohr Hochma”, while the pleasure from giving is called “Ohr Hassadim”. Phase two ( Bina ) wants to give, but it finds out it has nothing to give, that it “is dying” without Ohr Hochma . That is why it decides to receive a little bit of the Ohr Hochma . This is what constitutes the third phase, Behina Gimel (3). In this phase, there are two different desires in the vessel: the “desire to receive” and the “desire to bestow”. But the “desire to give” prevails. In spite of the fact that it has nothing to bestow upon the Creator, the “desire to give” still exists in it. This desire is filled with the light of Hassadim . It has in it also a little bit of the light of Hochma , which fills the “desire to receive”. The fourth phase, Malchut, is being gradually born from the third one. The “desire to receive” grows stronger, pushing out the “desire to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 104 give”, and after awhile the “desire to receive” remains as the sole one. Therefore, this phase is called “ Malchut”, i.e., the kingdom of desire, the desire to absorb everything, the entire pleasure (Ohr Hochma). This phase is a completion of the creation, and since it receives everything infinitely, endlessly, it is called “the world of Infinity”. These are the four phases of the Direct Light coming from the Creator. The rest of the creation, all the worlds, angels, Sefirot , souls - everything is only a part of Malchut. Since Malchut desires to be like the phases preceding it, the entire creation is a reflection of these 4 phases. To understand it, to explain how these four phases are reflected in each of the worlds, how this affects our world; how we, by working actively with the help of feedback from above, can affect them and join in the general process of the Universe; this is the purpose of the science called Kabbalah. Our goal is to comprehend it all. שהן , כולו בכלל הן . נברא וכל נאצל בכל הנבחנות , ספירות עשר ס \" ה ל \" הנ ההבחנות ' ד ואלו ( ו .\" האצילות עולם \" או \" חכמה \" נקראת א \" ובחי . שבמציאות ביותר קטן בפרט והן , העולמות ' ד ד \" ובחי .\" היצירה עולם \" או \" תפארת \" נקרא ג \" ובחי .\" הבריאה עולם \" או \" בינה \" נקרא ב \" ובחי .\" העשיה עולם \" או \" מלכות \" נקרא לעולם ובאה ה \" ב ס \" מא נמשכת כשהנשמה כי . נשמה בכל הנוהגות בחינות ' הד את ונבאר יורה \" נשמה \" השם כי . הזה בשם נבחנת אינה עוד ושם . הנשמה של א \" בחי היא , האצילות גילוי לאיזה ובאה ס \" א מבחינת יצאה הזה ההפרש י \" שע , ה \" ב מהמאציל הפרש איזה בה שיש עד ,' ית מעצמותו אותה שיפריד מה אין , כלי צורת בה שאין עוד וכל . עצמה בפני לרשות . עצמה בפני בשם להקרא ראויה שתהיה בעולם הנאמר ס \" וז . להאור בטלה וכולה לכלי כלל ניכרת אינה הכלי של א \" שבחי ידעת וכבר בעלי שאר נשמות ואפילו .\" בהון חד וגרמוהי וחיוהי איהו \" בסוד , גמור אלקיות שכולו אצילות .' ית בעצמותו דבוקים כעודם נחשבים , אצילות עולם את עוברים בהיותם , החיים 6) The four above-mentioned phases correspond to the ten Sefirot of which every created being consists. These four phases correspond to the four worlds of ABYA, which include the entire Universe, and all the details existing in reality. Behina Aleph is called Hochma, or the world of Atzilut. Behina Bet is called Bina, or the world of Beria. Be-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 105 hina Gimel is called Tifferet, or the world of Yetzira. Behina Dalet is called Malchut,or the world of Assiya. Now let us understand the nature of these four Behinot existing in ev- ery soul. Each soul (Neshama) originates in the world of Infinity and descends to the world of Atzilut, acquiring the properties of Behina Aleph there. In the world of Atzilut, it is not yet called “Neshama”, for this name points to a certain degree of separation from the Cre- ator that leads to a fall from the level of Infinity, from a state of complete unity with the Creator, and acquires some “independence”. However, it is not yet a completely formed vessel, so nothing separates it from the Creator’s Essence thus far. As we already know, while in Behina Aleph, the vessel is not yet such, for at this stage it annuls itself as regards the light. Hence, in the world of Atzilut, everything is said to be still absolutely Divine – “He is one and His Name is one”. Even the souls of other creatures passing through this world merge with the Creator. . להשפיע הרצון של הכלי בחינת דהיינו , ל \" הנ ' הב בחינה שולטת כבר הבריאה ובעולם ( ז אז , שם אשר ההוא הכלי בחינת ומשגת , הבריאה לעולם ובאה משתלשלת כשהנשמה כ \" וע בשם עולה והיא ' ית עצמותו מבחינת ונתפרדה יצאה שכבר , דהיינו .\" נשמה \" בשם נבחנת כ \" וע , להמאציל הצורה בהשואת להיותו , מאוד זך זה כלי אמנם .\" נשמה \" להקרא , עצמה בפני . גמורה לרוחניות נחשבת 7) Behina Bet rules in the world of Beria; i.e., its vessel is the “desire to bestow”. Consequently, when the soul arrives in the world of Beria, it reaches this stage of the vessel’s development and is already called “Neshama”. This means it separated from the Creator’s Essence and acquired a certain degree of independence. Nevertheless, this vessel is still very “pure”, “transparent”, i.e., very close in its properties to the Creator. Thus, it is regarded as being completely spiritual. כ \" וע . לקבל הרצון מצורת מעט כלולה שהיא , ל \" הנ ' הג בחינה שולטת כבר היצירה ובעולם ( ח הרוחניות מבחינת יצאה , ההוא הכלי ומשגת , היצירה לעולם ובאה משתלשלת כשהנשמה מעט דהיינו , מועטת בעביות מעורב כבר שלו הכלי כאן כי .\" רוח \" בשם ונקראת , הנשמה של"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 106 להבדילו מספיק זאת עביות שיעור אין כי , לרוחני נבחנת עדיין אמנם . בו שיש לקבל הרצון .\" עצמו ברשות עומד , גוף \" בשם להקרא ,' ית עצמותו מן לגמרי 8) Behina Gimel rules in the world of Yetzira; it contains a certain amount of the “desire to receive”. Therefore, when the soul comes to the world of Yetzira, reaches this stage of the vessel’s development, it exits the state of “Neshama”, and is now called “Ruach”. This ves- sel already possesses certain Aviut, i.e., some portion of the “desire to receive”. It is nevertheless still considered as spiritual, since this quantity and quality of the “desire to receive” is insufficient to be completely separated in its properties from the Creator’s Essence. A complete separation from the Creator’s Essence is a body, which is now fully and clearly “independent”. משגת כ \" וע . הגדול לקבל הרצון של הכלי גמר שהיא ,' הד בחינה שולטת כבר עשיה ובעולם ( ט ,\" נפש \" נקרא שבו והאור . עצמו ברשות העומד ,' ית מעצמותו לגמרי ונבדל נפרד גוף בחינת מכל כלול יהיה שלא , בהמציאות קטן פרט לך שאין , ותדע . מעצמו תנועה בלי אור על המורה . ע \" האבי 9) Behina Dalet rules in the world of Assiya; it is the final stage of the vessel’s development. At this level, the “desire to receive” reaches the peak of its evolution. The vessel turns into a body totally separat- ed from the Creator’s Essence. The light inside Behina Dalet is called “Nefesh”. This name points to the lack of independent movement in this type of the light. In addition, remember that nothing exists in the Universe that does not consist of its own ABYA (four Behinot). What is the difference between the “desire to receive” and the soul? The “desire to receive” is called Behina Dalet . It is the heart of everything; it feels and attains all levels. As a rule, “the light” is named \"soul\". The light without the one who comprehends it is called “light”. The light together with the one who attains it is called “the soul”. For example, five people are watching an airplane through binocu- lars, and each one has better binoculars than another does. Now, the first one says that the size of the plane is 20 cm. The second claims it to"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 107 be 1 m. Each of them speaks the truth because they base their specula- tions on what they see, but their opinions in no way affect the plane. The reason for the difference of opinions consists in the difference of quality of the binoculars’ lenses. The same occurs with us; there is no change in the light, all the changes are in those who attain it, and whatever we grasp is called “the soul”. In our example the binoculars are the equivalence of properties, and in this sense there are differences between those who attain, and all the more so in that which is attained, the soul. מעצמותו מיש יש נמשכת , בהגוף המלובש החיים אור שהיא , הזאת שהנפש איך , מוצא והנך ( י שבאה עד .' ית פניו מאור ומתרחקת הולכת היא כן , ע \" אבי עולמות ' ד דרך ובעברה . ממש ' ית שבה האור גם אמנם ואם . הרצוי צורתו לגמר הכלי נבחן ואז .\" גוף \" הנקרא , לה המיוחד בכלי . מוצאו שורש עוד בו ניכר שאין עד , מאד נתמעט , שלו הכלי את ומזכך הולך הוא , ליוצרו רוח נחת להשפיע מ \" ע ומצות בתורה העסק י \" ע ז \" עכ הבריאה במחשבת הכלול , השיעור בכל הגדול השפע את לקבל ראוי שנעשה עד ,\" גוף \" הנקרא הרבה לפיכך , ישראל את לזכות ה \" הקב רצה \" : עקשיא בן חנניא ' ר שאמר וזה . שבראה בעת .\" ומצוות תורה להם 10) The Nefesh, the light of life installed in the body, comes directly from the Creator’s Essence. Passing through the four worlds of ABYA, it gradually moves away from the Creator until it acquires a vessel, a body assigned to it. Only then is the vessel considered as completely formed. At this stage of the vessel’s development, the light inside it is so small that its source cannot be felt, i.e., the creation (the vessel) stops feeling the Creator. However, with the help of the Torah and the Commandments with the intention to bestow delight upon the Creator, the creation can pu- rify its vessel called the body, and receive all the light prepared for it by the Creator in the Thought of Creation. That is what Rabbi Ha- nania ben Akashia meant by saying, “The Creator wished to reward Israel, so He gave them the Torah and the Commandments...”"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 108 Here he explains the notion “Aviut” , which we have to “Lezakot”, purify. Behina Dalet is called Aviut, because it receives for the sake of self- enjoyment. The purpose is to achieve the equivalence of the properties, i.e., to receive for the sake of bestowal. That is what is defined as “ Zakut ” - purification. One can reach such a level by learning the Torah with the intention to acquire the “desire to give”. There cannot be two contrary desires simultaneously in the Kli ; it is either the “desire to receive” or the “desire to give”. If there are two desires in one Kli , it is divided into two parts, into two Kelim, propor- tionately. “Time” in the spiritual world is the cause-and-effect connection between spiritual objects, the birth of the lower out of the higher. There are causes and effects in the spiritual worlds, but there are no time gaps between the two. In our world, as a rule, some time passes between a cause and an effect. If we say “before”, we mean the cause; but if we say “after”, we mean the effect. We will gradually get used to such notions as “the ab- sence of time and space”. Rambam wrote that all our matter, the entire Universe, is below the speed of light. If anything exceeds the speed of light, time stops, and space contracts into a point. This is also known from Einstein’s theory of relativity. What is beyond it? Beyond it is the level of the spiritual world where space and time do not exist, i.e., they are taken by a person com- prehending them as equal to zero. Spiritual space can be compared to our inner spiritual world where one feels either satisfied or drained. There are only the Creator and the creation in the world. The creation is the “desire to receive” the light, pleasure from the Creator. In our world, this desire is unconscious; we cannot feel the source of life, of pleasure. In our world, the desire to receive pleasure is egoistic. If man can correct it and start using it altruistically, he begins to feel the light,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 109 the Creator, the spiritual world in the same Kli . The spiritual world and the Creator are the same. Man’s corrected desire is called “the soul”. A soul is divided into different parts, private souls. Then they become diminished and move away from the Creator according to their properties and enter into man born in this world. A soul can enter a grown-up person at any time of his life. It happens according to a program given from above. The souls supersede one another in one and the same person dur- ing his life. In fact, it is similar to the clothes that a man changes all the time. The same is true with the soul; it changes its material dress, its physiological body, leaving it, and being replaced by another soul. The body dies, but the soul changes its dress for another one. Man’s purpose is, while still living in this world, being in this body, in spite of all its egoistic desires, to strive to reach the spiritual level from which his soul descended. By achieving this goal, man reaches a spiritual level, which is 620 times higher than the present one. It corresponds to the 613 principal and seven additional commandments. All the souls have the same task - to achieve their complete cor- rection. That means to rise 620 times higher. Man can rise to that level with the help of the bodily encumbrances. That is the meaning of being in our world, in our body. The only difference between the souls is in their initial and final conditions, depending on the soul’s character and on which part of the common soul it comes from. When all the souls combine into one, a completely new state of quantity and quality of the common desire and the volume of information emerges. There are certain types of souls that have already completed their own correction and have descended to our world to correct others. Such is the soul of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which later incarnated into the Ari, and then finally into the Baal HaSulam. Sometimes such a soul de- scends to influence the world as a whole, sometimes to bring up future Kabbalists."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 110 After the final correction, there will be no difference between souls. The distinction between them exists only in their way to the Goal. It is said, that the people of Israel went into exile to disseminate the knowledge about spirituality and thus drew other peoples to the way of correction, those who were worthy of correction and elevation. Note well, the material action similar to the spiritual one takes place in our world, in our bodies. The connection between the spiritual and the material worlds is unilateral; it comes from above, from the spiritual to the material. Man is pushed ahead by the feeling of shame. Upon feeling shame, Malchut of the world of Infinity contracted and stopped receiving pleasure. The shame was so unbearable, that it was greater than the pleasure. What is shame? It is absolutely different from the feeling we know. Spiritual shame arises exclusively when man feels the Creator. It is the feel- ing of spiritual variance between the Creator and man. Although receiv- ing everything from the Creator, man cannot give him the same in return. Shame is characteristic only of the higher souls that have already entered the spiritual world and ascended to the levels where the Creator can be felt. The sensations cannot be conveyed. If man knows this or that feel- ing, it can be aroused in him from outside, but not be made afresh. Spiri- tual sensations are particularly indescribable because only the one who attains them feels them. Both in our world and in the spiritual one, the man who feels something can neither convey nor prove his sensations to anyone else. It is an intensely personal experience. We feel only that which enters us. We do not know what is outside of us, what does not pass through our senses. Science constantly discov- ers something new, but we do not know what has not been uncovered yet, and there is no way we can know it in advance. It is still beyond us, around us; it has not yet entered our mind and sensations. By its “discoveries”, science only ascertains the existence of certain facts in nature. The undiscovered realm continues to exist around us"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 111 and outside of our sensations. Kabbalah is also a science; however, it re- searches not our world, but the spiritual one, providing man with an ad- ditional sense. By entering the spiritual world, we can better understand ours. All events that take place in the spiritual world descend to us, while all the effects of our world ascend to the spiritual world according to the law of constant circulation and interaction of all information. Our world is the last, lowest level of all the existing worlds. Hence, the Kabbalist, who enters the spiritual world, can see the descending and ascending souls, the causes and effects of all spiritual and material processes. Is the science of Kabbalah verifiable? Looking at our world from above, one can see that all the teachings and religions end where man’s inner world, his inner psychology comes to the limit. As long as it is impossible to demonstrate anything spiritual on the level of our world, it will be impossible to prove anything. Only the one who ascends will see it. Hence, Kabbalah is called a secret science. If man is born blind in our world, it is impossible to explain to him the meaning of “seeing”. In Kabbalah, there is a method of strictly scientific, reasonable, critical self-attainment. When an additional sense emerges, man begins to talk with the Creator, to feel Him. The Creator begins to open his own inner world - the only thing man can feel and understand. As any other created being, man can feel only what descends to him from the Creator. Perhaps the Creator has something else He does not speak about? Of course, He does. We also receive more and more new information, new sensations, which He has not introduced into us before. However, one cannot pass judgment about something he has not yet received from the Creator. Man attains everything in Kabbalah by going through the 6000 levels, or so-called “six thousand years”. Having completed his spiritual"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 112 ascent, consisting of 6000 levels, man rises to the higher level of attain- ment - the 7th millennium or “ Shabbat ”. Then three more ascents come– the 8th, 9th and 10th millennia, where man attains the highest Sefirot : Bina, Hochma and Keter . These levels are above the creation. They completely belong to the Creator who gives the corrected souls such attainments, such merging with Him. Nothing is written about this anywhere; there is no language capa- ble of describing it. It refers to the Torah secrets. Hence, when one asks about the Creator Himself, we cannot answer anything. We speak only about the light that emanates from Him. We attain the light and thus at- tain the Creator. Whatever we attain, we call “The Creator”, something that created us. It turns out that we actually attain ourselves, our inner world, and not Him. Being completely filled with the light, Malchut felt that, although it had pleased the Creator by receiving His light, it was totally opposite to Him in its properties. It only wants to receive pleasure, while the Creator’s only desire is to give pleasure. At this stage of development, Malchut, for the first time, felt a burn- ing shame because it had seen the Giver and His properties, and all the vast difference between Him and itself. As a result of this sensation, Malchut decides to completely free itself from the light, as in phase 2 ( Bina ), with the only difference being that here the creation passionately desires to receive pleasure and feels how much this desire is contrary to the Creator’s. The expulsion of the light out of Malchut is called “ Malchut i s c a l l e d “ Malchut Tzimtzum Aleph ” ( TA ). Because of TA , Malchut remains completely empty. The Creator acted Malchut r e m a i n s c o m p l e t e l y e m p t y . T h e C r e a t o r a c t e d Malchut up to phase four. Beginning with the feeling of shame, the creation starts acting as if “independently”, the feeling of shame being its driving force. After the restriction, Malchut does not want to receive any more light. It feels its contrast to the Creator Who gives it this pleasure. Being filled with the light, and thus fulfilling the Creator’s desire, Malchut now"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 113 has finally become contrary to the Creator. What should it do so as not to feel shame and be similar to the Creator, i.e., to receive, because He wants it to, and to give the way He does? Malchut can achieve such a state if it receives not for its own sake, not for satisfying its own desire to receive pleasure, but for the sake of the Creator. This means that it will now receive the light only because, by doing so, it gives pleasure to the Creator. It is similar to the guest who, even though very hungry, refuses to receive the treat for his own sake, but receives to please the host. For this purpose, Malchut creates a screen - a force resisting the ego- istic desire to receive pleasure for its own sake, which pays no attention to the Giver. This force pushes away all the light coming to it. Then, with the help of the same screen, Malchut calculates what amount of the light it can receive for the sake of the Creator. Malchut opens up only to the portion of the light measured by the screen that it can receive for the Creator’s sake. The remaining part of Malchut, i.e., the rest of its desires, remains empty. If it could fill itself completely with the light and receive for the sake of bestowal, it would have become similar to the Creator by its properties. It would finish the correction of its egoism and begin using it only to give pleasure to the Creator. Such a state of absolute correction of Malchut is “the purpose of the creation” and is called “The End of the Correction” (of egoistic de- sire to receive pleasure). But it is impossible to reach such a state in one moment, one action, because it is completely contrary to Malchut’s egoistic nature. Malchut receives its correction in parts, in portions over a period of time. The light that enters the Kli is called “ Ohr Yashar” (the Direct Light). The Kli’ s intention to receive the light only for the Creator’s sake is called “ Ohr Hozer” (the Reflected Light). With the help of this intention, the Kli reflects the light. The part of the Kli that receives the light is called"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 114 “ Toch ” (inner part). The remaining empty part of the Kli is called “ Sof ” Sof ” Sof (end). Together, Toch and Sof form the “ Guf ” (body) - the desire to receive Guf ” ( b o d y ) - t h e d e s i r e t o r e c e i v e Guf pleasure. One should take into consideration that, when Kabbalistic books speak about “the body”, a “desire to receive” is always meant. With the exception of our world, the entire spiritual Universe is built on this single principle - to receive for the sake of the Creator. It appears that the Universe is only variations of Malchut emptied in TA , which now fills itself with the help of the screen. The outer, less signifi- cant part of this Malchut is called the worlds of Adam Kadmon, Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira and Assiya . However, the remaining inner part of Malchut is called “the soul”, Adam . The process of filling Malchut with the light is qualitative and quantitative. This is the very process we are going to study. It consists in the fact that each tiny part of Malchut that descended into our world must correct itself by merging with the Creator. And each such particle is inside man. It is his real “self”. The part of Malchut that does not yet receive the light, but just makes a preliminary analysis, calculating how much light it can receive for the Creator’s sake, is called “the Rosh” (head). As much light as Mal- chut can receive, so much pleasure can it give to the Creator. Malchut has a complete freedom of will; it can choose either not to receive at all, or to receive as much as it wants. It controls its egoism and chooses just this state to be similar to the Creator. It works with its egoism, i.e., not only it chooses not to receive for its own sake, but receives for the sake of the Creator. Malchut has to feel pleasure, because this is the Creator’s desire; but the intention must be altruistic. That is why it cannot receive for the Creator’s sake all the light coming from Him. There arises a contradic- tion between the intention and the pleasure itself. If Malchut does not en- joy, neither would the Creator. All His pleasure is in pleasing Malchut."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 115 The light that entered the Toch of Malchut is called “Ohr Pnimi” (the Inner Light). The place where the screen sits is called “ the Peh” (mouth). The screen in Hebrew is “Masach” . The boundary where the Kli stops re- ceiving the light is called “ the Tabur” (navel). The line signifying the end of the Kli is called “the Sium ” (completion) or “Etzbaot Raglin” (toes). The part of the light that Malchut cannot receive, because of a weak screen remains outside and is called “Ohr Makif” (the Surrounding Light). The light that Malchut receives inside should correspond to its intention to receive this light for the Creator’s sake. This intention, as is known, is called “the Reflected Light”. Therefore, the light from the head enters the body and mixes with the Reflected Light. The Toch , filled with the light, is absolutely similar to the Creator and is in a state of constant exchange of pleasure with Him. The Creator emanates pleasure, which is felt by the souls according to their measure of “hunger”, the desire to receive it. The problem here is to desire to feel the Creator and to receive pleasure from Him. This is what Kabbalah teaches us. One can feel the Creator only to the degree of similarity of his own properties. The sense that perceives, that feels the Creator, is called “ the Masach” (screen). The entrance into the spiritual world starts with a minimal screen emerging in man, when he begins to feel the outer world and understands that it is the Creator. Then, by studying Kabbalah, man increases the magnitude of his screen and begins to feel the Creator more and more. The screen is the force of resistance to one’s egoism and the measure of one's similarity to the Creator. It allows him to harmonize his intention according to the intention of the Creator. To the extent that man’s desires are equal in their measure of likeness to those of the Creator’s, he begins to feel the Creator. Nothing exists in the Universe except the Creator’s desire “to be- stow” and the creation’s initial desire “to receive”. Every subsequent pro-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 116 cess is the correction of this desire “to receive” with the help of the desire “to bestow”. Yet, how can man change something that was created by the Creator - the desire “to receive”, if it is his very essence? The answer is that it occurs only with the help of the intention “to receive for the sake of bestowal”. The creation becomes equal to the Creator in its properties, its spiritual level. Every created being should achieve such a state either during one or several lifetimes. This process takes place throughout every generation. We are the consequence, the product of the previous generations; our souls have been here more than once, and have descended yet again and again. They accumulate the experience of suffering and the readiness to approach nearer to the spiritual... Man’s nature is one of laziness, and it is a very good feeling. Unless he had it, he would have scattered himself all over the different kinds of pursuits, without giving preference to anything. One should not be afraid of laziness; it protects us from unnecessary activities. The Creator’s actions become apparent in the first two phases: The Zero phase, called “the root”, is the light emanating from the Creator. The First phase, called “Hochma” is the “desire to receive” the light, the vessel (the Kli ), created by the light itself, that it may receive the pleasure contained in this light. Furthermore, until the end of the entire creation, everything happens only as the Kli ’s reaction to the light inside it. Everything occurs only due to the interconnection between these two components - the light and the vessel, the “desire to give” pleasure and the “desire to receive” that pleasure. The Second phase, called “Bina”, is the first reaction of the Kli to the light that fills it; the Kli borrows the property of “bestowal” from the light and wants to be equal to it. That is why it expels the light. The Third phase, called “Tifferet”, or “Zeir Anpin”, is the first ac- tion performed by the Kli . It understands that the Creator wants it to"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 117 receive and enjoy the light. Therefore, it begins receiving a little bit of the light. This “desire to receive” is the third phase. The Fourth phase is called “Malchut” . In the third phase the Kli ’s “desire to receive” the entire light of Hochma emanating from the Cre- ator develops, and this desire is then called Malchut. This fourth phase is the complete desire, the only creation. We can see that the creation has only one desire - to receive and enjoy the light of Hochma . Initially, the only possibility for bestowal is by not receiving for its own sake, but for the sake of the Creator. However, to become a giver it is necessary to feel the Creator and to receive only for the sake of bestowing pleasure upon Him.You become partners. He gives to you and you give to Him. You become equal in your properties and aspirations; you suffer if He does not receive pleasure, but He also suffers if you do not enjoy what he has prepared for you. He and you become one whole. The fourth phase, Malchut, is then subdivided into five parts. This happens, because it cannot correct all of its egoism at once, i.e., it is unable to receive the entire light prepared for it for the Creator’s sake. The “desire to receive” for someone else’s sake is unnatural; hence, the creation should gradually “get used” to this desire. Malchut wants to be similar to the preceding phases. Hence, it di- vides itself into five parts: (a) The root part of The root part of The root part Malchut is similar to the root phase of the Direct Light; (b) The first part of The first part of The first part Malchut is similar to the first phase of the Direct Light; (c) The second part of The second part of The second part Malchut is similar to the second phase of the Direct Light; (d) The third part of The third part of The third part Malchut is similar to the third phase of the Direct Light;"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 118 (e) The fourth part of The fourth part of The fourth part Malchut is Malchut itself, which is not simi- lar to any of the previous properties. Therefore, it is absolutely egoistic. These phases are correspondingly called: 1. Still 2. Vegetative 3. Animal 4. Human and 5. Spiritual The souls are created out of the last part of Malchut. The rest of the Universe, the worlds and everything that fills and inhabits them, is created out of the preceding parts of Malchut. The difference between the levels of the creation is in the degree of the desire to receive pleasure: from the least in the still nature to the biggest in man and to the highest in the souls. Through reincarnations, man feels all kinds of desires. The one who has even an unconscious desire to become closer to the Creator has also the rest of rougher desires. The question becomes, in what propor- tion are these desires represented in him, and which desire should he choose for his actions? With the help of the group and the Rabbi (Teacher), one can re- place all of his desires with the single one of attaining the Creator. While moving towards that Goal, the rest of the desires grow and interfere with this advancement. There come all kinds of desires, including sex, money, power, fame, knowledge, and the various idols of the material world. Man is given all kinds of temptations from above; he is lured by the possibility of growing rich, of being promoted to a high post etc. It happens so that man can get to know himself, to realize his aspirations and weaknesses, his insignificance in withstanding tempting pleasures. All of this is only that he may learn what this desire to receive pleasure is that the Creator has fashioned in him."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 119 Kabbalah is a science of self-knowledge, of revealing the Creator in oneself. Man realizes what is most important to him. It matters what man does with his free time, what he thinks about the rest of the time. A Kabbalist should work. Free time can be used in the right way only if it is planned beforehand. If you think about the question “What am I living for?” during your free time, then it will allow you to think correctly the rest of the time. To ascend spiritually, one should have an objective to correct, i.e., it is necessary to have the “desire to receive”, egoism. Only this, the “de- sire to receive”, corrected with the help of the intention to receive for the sake of the Creator, becomes the vessel into which the light intended by the Creator enters. It turns out that the more egoistic man becomes the better. For man’s egoism steadily grows during his approach to the Creator. It is necessary to make a bigger egoist out of man. In this way, he might come to feel that something in him requires correction. Egoism makes man negatively perceive the positive manifestation of the Creator. Nevertheless, this very negative sense of the Creator brings us to Him. During the spiritual ascent, drawing nearer to the Creator, all negative emotions turn into positive ones. Man’s inner “self” is the Creator. We feel separated from Him only because our egoism is not yet corrected. The entire creation consists of five Behinot : Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet or Zeir Anpin and Malchut, to which correspond 10 Sefirot . Why are there 10? The matter is that Tifferet consists of 6 Sefirot : Hesed, Gevu- ra, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod . Let us point out that the name “Tifferet” means both one of the 5 Behinot , and one of its private Sefirot . This private Sefira , one of the 6, determines the character of the common Tifferet . However, it is more usual to use the name Zeir Anpin ( ZA ) instead of Tifferet. This name (the tetragrammaton) is more accept- ed, especially in the school of the Ari. These 10 Sefirot include the entire Universe."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 120 These five Behinot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA , Malchut, are also the five worlds that we otherwise call by the name of the Creator ( Yud-Hey- Vav-Hey ). This name is usually pronounced as HaVaYaH. It has an infi- nite multitude of meanings, because it provides the framework, the basis of all the names of all the creations: Sefira World Letter Keter Hochma Bina ZA Malchut Adam Kadmon Atzilut Beria Yetzira Assiya The point of the letter Yud (Kutzo shel Yud) Yud Hey Vav Hey Our world is a part of the world of Assiya . Although our world is formally under its lowest spiritual level, as there is no place for such an egoistic property as the one ruling over our world in the spiritual realm, this is considered to be the final level of the world of Assiya . The reason for the creation of the worlds consists in the fact that, in order to give pleasure to the creation, the Creator has to create in it several conditions: -The creation must want to receive pleasure. -This desire must come from the creation itself. -It must be independent, which is not the same as in the previous condition. -The creation must be able to rule over this desire, so that the desire may neitherhave power over the creation, nor dictate its behavior. -The creation must be independent to choose whether it will receive pleasure by being a creation, or by being similar to the Creator."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 121 The creation must be able to act freely between the two contrary forces: its own egoism and the Creator; it must independently choose its path and set out upon that path. In order to provide the creation (man) with these conditions, the Creator should: -Distance the creation from the light; -Create the condition for freedom of will; -Create an opportunity to attain the Universe and evolve; - Create an opportunity (what is the difference between a condi- tion and an opportunity?) for freedom of action. The Creator gradually creates such conditions for the creation. By creation, we mean man in our world, in the state where he already begins to realize himself in relation to the Universe or starts climbing the spiri- tual levels. Such a state is desirable for the beginning of man’s spiritual work and is called “this world”. Why did the Creator, Who is at the highest spiritual level, have to form the creation out of an egoistic property that is contrary to Him? Why did He initially completely fill creation with the light, which then empties itself of the light, and by doing so lower creation to the state of “this world” ( Olam Hazeh )? The matter is that creation is not independent; even though it is filled with the light, for it is completely suppressed by the light. The light dictates its conditions to the creation, and the desire to receive pleasure, the Kli , transfers its properties to it. For the creation of an independent Kli , absolutely free from the light’s assistance, the light should completely move away from it. There is a simple rule: the spreading of the light inside the Kli, with the sub- sequent expulsion of it, makes the Kli suitable for its function of in- dependently realizing and choosing the way of filling. Such a genuine, independent Kli can emerge only in our world."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 122 The descent of the light from above through all the worlds to man in this world presents the preparatory phase of formation of the genuine the Kli . At each phase, only the light determines all the forms, stages, and character of the Kli . As soon as the Kli completely expels the light, it becomes absolutely independent and is able to take on dif- ferent decisions. Any soul (one more name for the Kli ) that descends from a cer- tain spiritual level is considered as part of the Creator and is filled with His light, until it dresses into man’s body-desire and until he starts working with it. Only after a soul descends to our world and learns Kabbalah does it comprehend its real state. Then man, in whom a desire for spiritual advancement emerged, may ask the Creator to fill him with the spiritual light that will elevate him. However, man does not rise spiritually to the level from which his soul descended, but 620 times higher. How does man advance? If he were given from above an incen- tive for the attainment of the spiritual, he must not lose it. Man can be pushed several times from above, by providing him with the interest for spirituality. However, if he does not use this desire correctly, he will eventually be left in peace until his next incarnation. The Kli is forced to rise spiritually by the Surrounding Light, Ohr Makif . It shines from outside, because it cannot enter the egoistic Makif . It shines fr om outside, because it canno t ent er the egois tic Makif Kli yet. But this light affects man’s desire for spirituality and makes it grow so considerably, that all he wants is the spiritual ascent. Then he receives help from above. To increase the influence of the Surrounding Light and thus to start feeling the spiritual sensations, to break into the spiritual space one can only do this: a) under the guidance of a true Kabbalist; b) with the help of studyinggenuine books; c) through communication with the members of his group (collec- tive studies, work, meals)."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 123 Olam Hazeh (“this world”) is the state where man already feels that the Creator conceals Himself from him. At this time, we do not feel it yet. We are told that the Creator exists, we hear about it, but in any case, we cannot feel it. When man starts feeling that there is something out- side of our world, something that hides from him, it is called the double concealment of the Creator. Egoism is man’s property that automatically makes him derive ben- efit from everything he does. Only in this does he see the purpose of his actions. Altruism is a property we are totally unable to comprehend; it is when person does something without any benefit to himself. Nature endowed us only with the egoistic properties. Altruism is beyond the limits of our understanding. Only someone who feels the Creator can acquire this property. Us- ing the language of Kabbalah, when the light enters the Kli , it will pass its altruistic properties to it. Man cannot be corrected all by himself, and he is not required to. Under his Teacher’s guidance, during the group lessons, he has to arouse such spiritual desires that would cause the light to enter him. To obtain that one should work hard on his thoughts and desires to know what is exactly necessary, although he cannot yet desire it. If man performs an action in our world that seems outwardly altruistic, it actually means that he calculated its future reward in advance. Any movement, even the slightest one, is made only based on a calculation. As a result, it seems to man that he would be better off than he is now. If man did not make such calculations, he would not be able to move, for a certain amount of energy is needed for movement even at the molecular level of nature, and this energy is our egoism, i.e., the desire to receive pleasure. This law then “dresses” into general physical-chemical laws. In our world, man can only receive or give for the sake of receiving."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 124 It is worth noting here that the desires that make all humankind happy are also egoistic, for man, seeing himself as a part of humankind, desires to please this very part of him... Kabbalah permits the description of both the inner actions per- formed by man, and those the Creator performs on him, i.e., their inter- actions. Kabbalah is a physical-mathematical description of the spiritual objects and their actions, expressed in formulas, graphs and tables. All of them describe a Kabbalist’s inner spiritual actions, and only the one who can reproduce these actions in himself, and thus under- stand what these formulas mean, can know what stands behind them. A Kabbalist can pass this information on to his disciple only when the latter reaches at least the first spiritual level. Such information is passed “by word of mouth” ( mi Peh le Peh ), because the screen is at the level of “Peh” of the spiritual Partzuf . If a student has not yet acquired Partzuf . If a s tudent has no t y e t acq uir ed Partzuf the screen, he cannot really understand anything; he cannot yet receive anything from his teacher. When a Kabbalist reads a Kabbalistic book, he should feel each word, each letter internally, just as blind people feel each letter of the alphabet using the Braille system. We have studied four phases of the formation of the Kli (0- Shoresh or Keter , 1- Hochma , 2- Bina , and 3- Tifferet ). Why are there four and not five? It is because the fifth one is the Kli itself, and not the phase of its formation. Starting from Malchut, there are no more phases; the Kli is completely created, born, formed in its egoistic desire to receive pleasure from the light of Hochma . The Kli is independent not only in its desire, but in the implementation of its desire to act. However, if the light, the pleasure, fills the Kli , it dictates to the Kli the way it should act, because it suppresses it by filling it with delight. That is why the Kli is truly free in its intention only when it is not filled with the light. Still that is not enough yet; the light should not be felt even from afar; i.e., the Creator should conceal Himself completely from"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 125 the Kli, Malchut. Only then can Malchut be independent, free in its deci- sions and actions. When the Kli can realize its desires independently, when it is completely free from the influence of the light and pleasure, and the light cannot dictate to the Kli its conditions, such a state, is called “our world”, or “this world”. This state can be achieved if the light is removed not only from the inner part of the Kli , but gradually distances itself from outside of the Kli . In our world, man feels the Creator neither on the inside northe outside; i.e., hedoes not believe in His existence. The expulsion of the light from the Kli is called the restriction of the desire to receive pleasure, or simply the restriction, Tzimtzum Aleph . Moving the light away from outside of the Kli is attained with the help of a system of darkening screens that are called worlds. There are only five such screens; i.e., there are five worlds. Each of these worlds consists of five parts called “Partzufim” (plural of Partzuf ). Each Partzuf ). Eac h Partzuf Partzuf includes five Partzuf includes f iv e Partzuf parts called “Sefirot” (plural of Sefira ). As a result, Malchut is so remote from the light that it does not feel it at all. This is man in our world. In Kabbalah, we study the properties of the worlds, Partzufim and Sefirot ; i.e., the properties of screens that conceal the spiritual world, the Creator from us. Thepurpose of this study is to know what properties man should acquire so as to neutralize the concealing actions of all these worlds, Partzufim and Sefirot; to rise to the level of this or that spiritual level of Sefira, Partzuf or world. By acquiring the properties of a certain Partzuf in a certain world, Partzuf in a cer t ain w orld, Partzuf man immediately neutralizes the concealing action of this level and at- tains it. At this time, only the higher levels hide from him the Creator, the light. Gradually he should attain all the properties of all the levels, starting from the lowest one immediately above our world, and up to the highest level, his final correction."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 126 Let us return to Malchut, the 5th phase of the development of the Kli . When Malchut feels that it receives whilst the Creator gives, it per- ceives the contrast of its state to the Creator's to be so disgusting that it decides to stop receiving pleasure. Since there is no compulsion in the spiritual world, and pleasure cannot be felt, if there is no desire for it, the light disappears, stops being felt in the Kli . Malchut performs Tzimtzum Aleph ( TA ). In the previous phases, the Kli had not felt itself receiving, and only in the 5th phase, when it inde- pendently decides to receive, the Kli feels its opposition to the Creator. Only Malchut can make TA , for to make the Tzimtzum , one should first feel its complete opposition to the Creator. Another name for Malchut is soul, but the name “soul” may refer both to the Kli , and to the light in it. While reading a text, one should always remember whether it speaks about the creation or about what it is filled with. In the first case, it is a part of the creation itself, a desire. In the second case, it is the Creator’s part, the light. When a soul descends to the world of Atzilut from the world of Infinity, it becomes the soul of phase Aleph , but not the real soul. The distinction between it and the Creator is not yet felt. It is as a baby in its mother’s womb; it cannot be called independent yet, although it already exists. It is still in the interim phase. The world of Atzilut is absolutely spiritual, because the Kli is not felt in it; it is completely suppressed by the light and is a single whole with the light. The souls of the rest of the created beings, for example, animals, descending from above through the world of Atzilut , are also considered one with the Creator. However, in our world, the created beings are com- pletely empty of the light and infinitely remote from the Creator. The worlds are levels of closeness to the Creator in man’s ascent and the measures of remoteness from Him in the descent of the souls. It does not matter about what kind of souls we speak. Although all nature presents a single whole, some types of created beings, differing in the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 127 degree of their freedom of choice, can be singled out as more or less free in the choice of the Goal. Of all created beings, only man has a true freedom of will; the rest of nature ascends or descends with him, because everything in our Uni- verse is related to man. It is impossible to speak about a certain number of souls that pass this way, for it is difficult to give a quantitative estimate. Particles of other stronger and higher souls may appear in each of us. They begin to speak in us and push us forward. In fact, the soul is not something predetermined, permanent, something that accompanies our physiological body during its entire biological life. For example, the Ari, in his book “Shaar HaGilgulim” (“The Gates of Reincarnation”) describes the kind of souls and in what succession they took root in him. A soul is not something indivisible. It constantly merges and sepa- rates, creates new parts according to the demands of the correction of the common soul. Even during man’s life, some of the souls’ parts take root or leave him; souls constantly “flow” one into another. The world of Beria corresponds to the phase Bet-Bina , the “desire to bestow”, to please. The Kli in the world of Beria is called “Neshama”; for the first time it has its own desire, albeit the “desire to bestow”; hence, it is very “clear”, non-egoistic in its desires and considered to be absolutely spiritual. The world of Yetzira corresponds to the phase Gimel-Tifferet , or ZA , in which both the “desire to bestow” (approximately 90%) and the “de- sire to receive” (approximately 10%) emerge. There is a little bit of the light of Hochma on the bright background of Ohr Hassadim . The Kli in this phase passes from the state of Neshama to Ruach . Although the desires of the Kli are already egoistic to some degree, all the same the “desire to bestow” prevails; therefore, the Kli in the world of Yetzira is still quite spiritual. The completely egoistic fourth phase, Malchut, rules in the world of Assiya . Here the “desire to receive” is itself the Guf (body), which is ab-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 128 solutely remote from the Creator. The light that fills the Kli in the world of Assiya is called “ Nefesh ”; this name suggests that the Kli and the light are spiritually motionless similarly to the still nature of our world. The Kli becomes coarser as it gradually descends through the levels of the worlds, and moves away from the light until it is completely empty, i.e., it does not feel the light at all. Therefore, it becomes completely free from the light and the Creator in its thoughts and actions. Now, if the Kli itself prefers the path of spiritual development to “petty” egoistic pleasures, it will gradually be able to ascend through the levels of the worlds of Assiya, Yetzira, Beria, Atzilut, Adam Kadmon , and reach the world of Infinity, i.e., infinitely merge with the Creator, be- come equal with Him. Each man has a so-called black point in his heart, an embryo of the future spiritual state. In different people, this point is in a different state of readiness for the spiritual perception. There are people who cannot grasp spiritual notions at all; they have no interest in them. However, there are people who suddenly wake up, and are puzzled by the fact that they suddenly become interested in such “abstract” matters. As with all other animals, man lives under the influence of his par- ents, the environment, traits of his character. Having no freedom of will, he only processes the available information according to outer and inner factors. Then he performs the actions that seem best to him. Yet, everything changes when the Creator starts awaking man. A person wakes up under the influence of a small portion of the light that the Creator sends to him in advance. Upon receiving this portion, his inner point begins to demand further filling, forcing him to look for the light. Therefore, he starts to search for it in different occupations, ideas, philosophies, doctrines, study groups, until he comes to Kabbalah. Each soul on the Earth has to go along the same path! Until, with the help of the screen, his black point, reaches the size of a small Partzuf , man is considered to have no soul, no Partzuf , man is consider ed t o ha v e no soul, no Partzuf Kli, and natu-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 129 rally, no light in him. The presence of even the smallest spiritual Partzuf, having the lights of Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya, Yechida (NaRaNHaY), indicates man’s birth and his leaving of the animal state (which we are used to consider human, by the way). Man refers to such a spiritual state where one has already passed the spiritual barrier ( Machsom ) separating this world from the spiritual one, the world of Assiya ; i.e., one who has acquired the spiritual Kli called the soul. The experience accumulated by the soul in each of its incarnations in this world remains with it, and passes from generation to generation, only changing its physiological bodies as one would change a shirt. All bodily physical sufferings also register in the soul, and at a certain mo- ment, bring man to a desire to attain spirituality. The dressing of a soul into a woman’s body signifies that it does not have to go through any personal spiritual correction in this incarna- tion. A woman does not advance spiritually by herself, except by helping to circulate the wisdom of Kabbalah and receiving spiritual elevation through her husband. The Torah says that the hearts of those who rule the world are in the hands of the Creator. This refers to all politicians, heads of states, dictators - all those on whom humankind depends. All of them are noth- ing but marionettes in the hands of the Creator, through whom He controls everything. There is only one law in the spiritual realm - the law of the equiv- alence of the spiritual properties. If the properties of two people are equal, similar, they are spiritually close. If people differ in their thoughts, viewpoints, they feel separated and distant from one another, even if they are physically close. Spiritual proximity or distance depends on the similarity of the objects’ properties. If the objects completely coincide in their properties, desires, they merge. If two desires are contrary to one another, they are"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 130 said to be remote one from the other. The more similar two desires are, the closer they are in the spiritual world. If only one out of the numerous desires of the objects coincides, these two objects have contact only in one point. If there is not even one desire in us that is similar to the Creator’s, it means that we are absolutely remote from Him and have nothing with which to feel Him. If there appears just one desire in me that is similar to the Creator, then with it I will be able to feel the Creator. Man’s task is gradually to make all his desires similar to those of the Creator. Then man will completely merge into one spiritual object with Him, and there will be no distinction between them. Man will achieve everything the Creator has: eternity, absolute knowledge, and perfection. This is the ultimate purpose of the correction of all man’s natural desires. Malchut , upon expelling all the light in TA , decided to receive it with the help of a screen. The Direct Light comes to it, presses on the screen, wanting to get inside. Malchut refuses to receive the light, remem- bering the burning shame it felt when it was filled with it. Refusal to re- ceive the light means reflecting it with the help of the screen. Such light is called “Ohr Hozer” (the Reflected Light). The reflection itself is called “Haka’a” (a stroke) of the light into the screen. The reflection of pleasure (the light) takes place inside of man with the help of the intention to receive this pleasure only for the Creator’s sake. Man calculates how much he can receive to please the Creator. He, as it were, dresses the pleasure he wants to receive onto the intention to bestow upon the Creator; to receive, to enjoy for the sake of the Creator. The dressing of the Direct Light onto the Reflected Light allows Malchut, after TA, to expand and receive a portion of the light. It means that, at this point it becomes similar to the Creator by merging with Him. The Purpose of the creation is to fill Malchut completely with the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 131 Creator’s light. Then all reception of the light will be equal to bestowal and will mean total merging of the entire creation with the Creator. By dressing the coming pleasure into its intention (the Reflected Light), Malchut announces that it wants to feel this pleasure only be- cause, by doing so, it delights the Creator. In this case, reception is equal to bestowal, since the meaning of an action is determined by the Kli’s intention, not by the mechanical direction of the action, inward or out- ward. Pleasure felt in this case will be twofold: from receiving it and from bestowing it upon the Creator. Rabbi Ashlag wonderfully illustrates the situation with the exam- ple of a relationship between a guest and his host, the guest, receiving pleasure from the host, turns it as it were into giving. He pays a visit to the host, who knows exactly what he likes most. The guest sits down in front of the host, and the host puts his five most favorite dishes before him, the exact amount to match his appetite. If the guest had not seen the giver, the host, he would have shame- lessly pounced on the food and gulped down all the delicacies without leaving a bit, since they are exactly what he desires.However, the host, sitting in front of him, embarrasses him, so the guest refuses to eat. The host insists, explaining how much he wishes to please him, to give him delight. Finally, by trying to talk the guest into eating, the host says that the guest’s refusal makes Him suffer. Upon realizing that by eating the din- ner he will give pleasure to the host, turning himself into a giver instead of a receiver, i.e., becoming equal with the host in his intentions and properties, only then does the guest agree to eat. If a situation arises where the host wants to please the guest by put- ting the treat before him, and the guest, in return, eats it with the inten- tion to return the pleasure to the host, enjoying it at that, this condition is called interaction by stroke (Zivug de Haka’a) . However, it can take place only after the guest’s prior complete refusal to receive pleasure."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 132 The guest only accepts the treat when he is sure that he pleases the host by receiving it, as if doing him a favor.He receives it only to the ex- tent of his ability to think not about his own pleasure, but about pleasing the host, in other words, the Creator. So, why do we need all these pleasures in our world if they are all based on suffering? When a desire is fulfilled, the pleasure “is extin- guished” and disappears. Pleasure is felt only when there is a burning “desire to receive” it. With the help of the correction of our desires, by adding to them the intention “for the sake of the Creator”, we can enjoy infinitely, without feeling “hunger” before receiving pleasure. We can receive enormous de- light by granting pleasure to the Creator, with the help of constantly increasing in ourselves the feeling of His greatness. Since the Creator is eternal and infinite,we, by feeling His great- ness, create in ourselves the eternal and infinite Kli - hunger for Him. Thus, we can enjoy eternally and infinitely. In the spiritual world any reception of pleasure promotes an even larger “desire to receive” it, and it goes on forever. Filling becomes equal to giving: man gives, sees how much the Cre- ator enjoys it, and acquires an even bigger “desire to give”. However, the pleasure from giving should also be altruistic, i.e., for the sake of bestow- al, and not for the sake of receiving pleasure from it. Otherwise, it will be giving for self-enjoyment, as when we give while pursuing our own ends. Kabbalah teaches man to receive pleasure from the light with the intention for the sake of the Creator. If man can screen all the pleasures of this world, he will be able instantly to feel the spiritual world. Then man falls under the influence of the spiritually impure forces. They gradually provide him with additional spiritual egoism. He builds a new screen on it with the help of the pure forces, and then he can receive a new portion of the light, which corresponds to the quantity of egoism corrected by him. Thus, man always has the freedom of will."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 133 The notion of “screen” contains the difference between the spiri- tual and material. Receiving pleasure without the screen is a common egoistic pleasure of our world. The point is to prefer spiritual pleasures to the material ones and by developing the screen, to receive eternal plea- sure, which is intended for us according to the Thought of Creation. However, the screen can appear only under the influence of the light of the Creator, on the egoistic desire of the Kli . The moment the Creator reveals Himself to man, his question of who needs his efforts, instantly disappears. So all our work boils down to just one thing: to feel the Creator. To overcome any level of concealment, man must acquire the prop- erties of this level. By doing so, he “neutralizes” the restriction, takes upon himself the influence of the concealing level, so that the conceal- ment turns into revelation and attainment. For example, let us take a person whose every property belongs to our world. His properties are so unimproved that he is under the influ- ence of the concealment of all five worlds. If, because of the correction, his properties become similar to those of the world of Assiya , then this world stops concealing the Creator’s light from him, which means that man has spiritually ascended to the level of Assiya . A person , whose properties and sensations are already in Assiya, feels the concealment of the Creator on the level of the world of Yetzira . By correcting his properties according to those of Yetzira , he neutralizes the concealment of the Creator’s light on this level and begins to feel Him on the level of Yetzira . It turns out that the worlds are the screens that conceal the Creator from us. However, when man puts the screen on his egoism similar to those levels, he by doing so, reveals the part of the Creator’s light that this screen, this world was concealing. The one who is in a certain spiritual world will feel the conceal- ment on that level and the one above it, but not on the one below. So, if man is on the level of Sefira Hesed of the Partzuf ZA of the world of Beria ,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 134 then from this level downwards, all the worlds, all the Partzufim and all the Sefirot are already in him in their corrected state. These passed levels are the levels of revelation for him; he absorbed their egoism, corrected it with the help of the screen, and thus revealed the Creator on this level. However, the Creator is still concealed from him on all the higher levels. Overall, there are 125 levels from our world to the Creator: five worlds with five Partzufim in each world, with five Sefirot in each Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf The main thing is to take the first step into the spiritual world; after- wards it becomes much simpler. All the levels are similar to one another, and the difference between them is only in the material, not in the design. The world of Adam Kadmon consists of five Partzufim : Keter (Galgalta), Ho- chma (AB), Bina (SAG or Abba ve Ima, or AVI in short ), ZA ( in short ) , Z A ( in short sometimes it is called Kadosh Baruch Hu, Israel), Malchut (Shechina, Leah, Rachel). On each spiritual level, man as it were, changes his name, and according to where he is now, is called either Pharaoh, Moshe (Moses), or Israel. All of these are the Creator’s names, man’s levels of attaining Him. As a rule, the Kabbalistic books are written by Kabbalists who have passed all these levels of the correction. The levels that follow are not the levels of correction, but an indi- vidual’s attainment and personal contact with the Creator. They are not studied. They belong to the so-called “secrets of the Torah” ( Sodot Torah ) that are given as a gift to the one who has completely corrected himself. Unlike these, the levels of correction belong to the tastes of the Torah ( Ta’amey Torah ); they must be studied to be attained. The conveying of Kabbalistic information is the conveying light. The transferring of properties from the higher spiritual level to the lower one is called “descent” or “influence”, and from the lower to the higher one - “request”, “prayer”, MAN . The connection exists only between two adjacent Partzufim , one above the other. No communication is possible between two discontinuous levels. Each higher level is called the Creator with regard to the lower one; its relationship to the lower level can be likened to a ratio of the Universe to a grain of sand."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 135 מושלם לקבל רצון בו שיש כל כי : לגשמיות רוחניות בין להבחין האמיתי גדר תבין זה ועם ( יא הערוכה המציאות כל בפרטי נמצא והוא .\" גשמי \" נקרא הוא , ד \" בחי שהוא , בחינותיו בכל .\" רוחניות \" בשם נבחן , לקבל הרצון של הזה הגדול משיעור למעלה שהוא וכל . ז \" בעוה לעינינו . שבהם המציאות וכל , ז \" מעוה הגבוהים , ע \" אבי העולמות שהם מדומה מקום בבחינת אינן , העליונים בעולמות האמורות וירידות עליות ענין שכל , תבין ובזה יותר למקום נבחן , ד \" מבחי ביותר הרחוק כל כי . לקבל שברצון הבחינות ' ד בענין רק , ו \" ח . תחתון יותר למקום נבחן ,' ד בחינה אל המתקרב וכל . גבוה 11) Now we can understand the difference between the spiritual and the material. If the “desire to receive” has reached its final develop- ment, i.e., achieved the stage of Behina Dalet, it is called “material” and belongs to our world (Olam Hazeh). If the “desire to receive” has not yet reached its final development, then such a desire is considered spiritual and corresponds to the four worlds of ABYA, which are above the level of our world. You should understand that all ascents and descents in the Upper worlds are not by any means movements in some imaginary space, but are merely changes in the magnitude of the “desire to receive”. The object most remote from Behina Dalet is in the highest point. The closer an object is to Behina Dalet, the lower is its level. Here the name “Olam Hazeh” means the world of Assiya . The “desire to receive” in Behina Dalet is absolutely complete; this is the desire just to receive without giving anything in return. All ascents and descents in the spiritual world in no way refer to the notion of place they speak solely about the increase or decrease of the similarity of man’s inner properties to those of the Creator. If one likens it to our world, then the ascent can be imagined as a burst of joy and high spirits, while the descent would be a dismal mood. We speak about the similarity of properties though, when the mood only accompanies the realization of the spiritual ascent. In Kabbalah, all ac- tions refer to man’s inner feelings. It depends on man himself what property he should use. What re- ally matters is the measure of egoism that man works with right now and"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 136 “for whose sake”, i.e., for the sake of the Creator, which will be an ascent, or for his own, which corresponds to a fall. It is important how he uses his egoism and in what direction. לקבל הרצון רק הוא , בכללה הבריאה כל ושל הנברא של עיקרו שכל כיון : להבין יש אמנם ( יב למה כ \" א ,' ית מעצמותו מיש יש נמשך אלא , בריאה בכלל לגמרי אינו מזה שיותר ומה , בלבד תורה ידי על אותו לזכות מצווים ואנו , ועכירות לעוביות הזה לקבל הרצון את מבחינים אנו ? הבריאה מחשבת של הנעלה המטרה אל נגיע לא זה שזולת עד , ומצות 12) One should understand that the essence of each vessel and the entire Creation is only the “desire to receive”. Nothing outside the framework of this desire has anything to do with the creation, but refers to the Creator. Then why do we regard the “desire to receive” as something coarse, disgusting and requiring correction? We are in- structed to “purify” it with the help of the Torah and the Command- ments; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve the ultimate purpose of the Creation. The desire to receive pleasure was formed by the Creator and there- fore not subject to change. Man can only choose what size of a desire he can use now and “for whose sake”. If each of his desires he uses only for his own benefit, then it is egoism or “spiritual impurity”. If man wants to use his desires to receive pleasure while simultaneously delighting the Creator, then he has to choose only those of his desires with which he can really do so. Therefore, wishing to act altruistically, man should first check what kind of desires he can use to receive pleasure so that it returns to the Creator. Only then can he start filling them with pleasure. All of man’s desires are the desires of Malchut . They are divided into 125 parts called levels. Gradually, using larger and larger egoistic desires for the sake of the Creator, man ascends spiritually. The use of all of Malchut’s 125 pri- vate desires is called 'the complete correction of egoism'. Sometimes it is more convenient to divide Malchut’s desires into 620 instead of 125 parts. Such parts of the desire or rather their use"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 137 for the sake of the Creator are called “commandments”, actions for His sake. By fulfilling these 620 actions, commandments, man ascends to the same 125-th level. זה הרוחנים נפרדים כן , מקום ריחוק י \" ע מזה זה נפרדים שהגשמיים כמו כי , הוא והענין ( יג בדעתם הקרובים , אדם בני שני למשל . ז \" בעוה גם זה ותמצא . שבהם הצורה שינוי י \" ע מזה , ובהפך . מזה זה שיתרחקו , עליהם פועל מקום ריחוק ואין . זה את זה אוהבים הם , לזה זה תקרב לא המקום וקרבת , זה את זה שונאים הם הרי , בדעותיהם מזה זה רחוקים כשהם . במאומה אותם . זה אל זה מקרבם , שבדעתם הצורה וקרבת , מזה זה מרחקם , שבדעתם הצורה ששינוי הרי זה רחוקים הם הרי , השני של טבעו כנגד בחינותיו בכל הפוך הוא האחד של טבעו , למשל ואם והתקרבות התרחקות של הענינים שכל , ברוחניות תשכיל ז \" ועד . ממערב המזרח כרחוק מזה הם , הצורה שינוי מדת שלפי . בלבד צורה שינוי של משקלים הם , בהם הנבחנים , ויחוד וזווג . בזה זה מתדבקים הם , הצורה השואת מדת ולפי , זה מי זה מתפרדים , שבו נברא בחינת כל הוא כי , בהנברא מחויב חוק הוא לקבל שהרצון שהגם , תבין זה ועם לגמרי נפרד ז \" עי נעשה הוא ז \" עכ , הבריאה שבמחשבת המטרה לקבל הראוי הכלי והוא כולו הוא המאציל כי . המאציל לבין בינו הפכיות למדת עד צורה שינוי יש כי , מהמאציל השפעה מנצוצי בו ואין , לקבל כולו והוא . ו \" ח משהו אפילו קבלה מנצוצי בו ואין , להשפיע הצורה הפכיות כי בהכרח כ \" ע ונמצא . מזה יותר רחוקה הצורה הפכיות לך אין הרי . משהו אף . מהמאציל אותו מפרידה הזו 13) As all material objects are separated from one another by dis- tance in space, spiritual objects are also separated from one another due to the difference in their inner properties. Something like this can be seen in our world. For example, two men have similar views, sym- pathize with one another, and no distance can influence the empathy between them. On the contrary, when their views are very different, they hate one another and no proximity can unite them. Therefore, the similarity of views draws people together, while the differences separate them. If one person’s nature is absolutely op- posite to the nature of the other, these people are as remote from one another as East is from West. The same occurs in the spiritual worlds: moving away, rapprochement, merging – all these processes happen only according to the difference or resemblance between the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 138 inner properties of the spiritual objects. The difference in properties separates them, while their similarity brings them closer. The “desire to receive” is the principal element of the creation; this is the vessel necessary for the realization of the Purpose included in the Thought of the Creation. This is the desire that separates the creation from the Creator. The Creator is the absolute “desire to bestow”; He does not have a trace of the “desire to receive”. It is im- possible to imagine a greater contrast than this: between the Creator and the creation, between the “desire to bestow” and the “desire to receive”. The spiritual place means being with one’s properties on one of the 125 levels of the spiritual ladder. From this, it follows that the notion of “place” means quality, property, measure of correction. Even in our world, closeness in physical space does not bring two different characters close to one another; it is only the similarity of their properties, thoughts and desires that can bridge the gap between them. On the contrary, the difference in properties, thoughts, and desires moves the objects away from one another. שענינו ,' הא הצמצום סוד נעשה , הזה הרחוק הפירוד מגודל הנבראים את להציל ובכדי ( יד נשארה ההיא הקבלה גדלות שמדת , באופן . הקדושה פרצופי כל מן ד \" הבחי שהפריד , הוא בכלי מתוקן מסך בבחינת יצאו הקדושה פרצופי כל כי . אור מכל וריקן פנוי חלל בבחינת . הזו ד \" בבחי אור יקבלו שלא , שלהם מלכות זה הנה , לאחוריו אותו דוחה הזה והמסך , הנאצל אל ונתפשט נמשך העליון שהאור בעת , ואז ס \" הע ומלביש , למעלה ממטה חוזר אור המעלה , המסך ובין העליון אור בין הכאה כמו נבחן , העליון לאור ובהלבשתו .\" חוזר אור \" נקרא , לאחוריו הנדחה האור חלק אותו כי . העליון דאור . ד \" הבחי במקום העליון האור על קבלה כלי כ \" אח נעשה לאור והלביש שעלה , הנדחה אור שהוא , ח \" האו שיעור באותו , המלכות כלי התרחבה ז \" אח כי דהיינו , בהכלים האורות נתלבשו שבזה , למטה ממעלה גם והתפשטה , למעלה ממטה העליון , במסך העליון מאור דהכאה הזווג כי . מדרגה שבכל וגוף ראש ס \" וה . ההוא חוזר אור בתוך שפירושו , דראש ס \" ע בבחינת העליון דאור ס \" הע ומלביש , למעלה ממטה חוזר אור מעלה . כלים שרשי"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 139 ההוא ח \" האו עם מתפשטת כשהמלכות ז \" ואח . ממש הלבשה להיות יכולה לא עוד שם כי התלבשות נעשית ואז . העליון אור על כלים לבחינת ונעשה , חוזר האור נגמר אז , למטה ממעלה . גמורים כלים שפירושו , ההיא \" מדרגה של גוף \" ונקראת . בכלים האורות 14) In order to save the creation from such remoteness from the Cre- ator, the Tzimtzum Aleph (TA, the First Restriction) took place and separated Behina Dalet from the spiritual objects. This happened in such a way that the “desire to receive” turned into a space void of the light. After the Tzimtzum Aleph, all the spiritual objects have a screen on their vessel-Malchut in order to avoid receiving the light inside Behina Dalet. The moment the Upper Light tries to enter the creation, the screen pushes it away. Thisprocess is called a Stroke (Haka’a) between the Upper Light and the screen. Because of this blow, the Reflected Light rises and dresses the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light. The Reflected Light, dressed on the Upper Light, is becoming a vessel instead of Behina Dalet. After this, Malchut expands in accordance with the height of the Reflected Light, then spreads downwards, thus letting the light get in- side. One says that the Upper Light dresses onto the Reflected Light. This is called the “Rosh” (head) and the “Guf” (body) of each level. The Stroke Contact of the Upper Light with the screen causes the lifting of the Reflected Light. The Reflected Light dresses onto the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light, thus forming the 10 Sefirot de Rosh. The 10 Sefirot de Rosh are not the real vessels yet; they only pass for their roots. It is only after Malchut, with the Reflected Light, spreads downwards, that the Reflected Light turns into the vessels for the reception of the Upper Light. Then the lights dress into the vessels, called “the body” of this particular level. The real, complete vessels are called “the body”. The creation is formed as absolutely egoistic. Moreover, according to this property it is as remote as can be from the Creator. To help the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 140 creation out of such a state, the Creator fashioned in Malchut a desire to make TA, i.e., to separate Behina Dalet from all pure Behinot , leaving it absolutely empty in the space filled with nothing. On its way to the creation, the Upper Light ( Ohr Elion ) collides with the screen, which is in front of Behina Dalet’s desire to receive plea- sure, and which completely pushes it back. This phenomenon is defined as an interaction by the stroke between the Upper Light and the screen and is called “Haka’a” (stroke). Divided by the screen into 10 parts, Se- firot , the Reflected Light, dresses onto the Upper Light, thus dividing it into 10 Sefirot . The combination of 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light and the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light forms the Rosh (head) of the Partzuf (spiritual object). Thus the Reflected Light, i.e., the desire to return to the Creator the pleasure that one receives from Him, becomes the condition of re- ceiving this pleasure, i.e., the vessel of reception ( Kli Kabbalah ) instead of Behina Dalet . Behina Dalet is unable to receive pleasure without the screen because of its egoistic desires. We see that the screen can change its intention from egoistic into altruistic, turn it into the “desire to re- ceive” for the Creator’s sake. Only after the creation builds such an in- tention can the higher light spread into the vessel and dress it into the desires- Kelim , formed by the Reflected Light. שהם ,' א הצמצום אחר ד \" בחי במקום דקדושה בפרצופי חדשים כלים בחינת שנעשו הרי ( טו נעשה הוא איך : הזה חוזר אור את להבין אמנם ויש . בהמסך דהכאה זווג של חוזר מאור נעשו הפוך תפקיד שמשמש ונמצא , מקבלה נדחה אור רק מתחילתו שהוא אחר , קבלה כלי לבחינת ? עצמו מענינו ומאוס . ההשפעה מדת ולהוקיר לחבב האדם מטבע כי . העולם דחיי מהויות במשל לך ואסביר , אצלו שיאכל מבקשו והוא , חברו לבית הבא , ולפיכך . מחברו הקבלה מדת בעיניו ושפל מתנה מקבל להיות בעיניו ושפל נבזה כי . לאכול יסרב , ביותר רעב שהוא בעת אפילו הרי . מחברו שיעשה , לעינים לו גלוי שיהיה עד דהיינו , מספיק בשיעור בו להפציר מרבה שחברו בעת אכן עצמו את מרגיש אינו כבר כי . אצלו ואוכל מתרצה אז הנה , זו אכילתו עם גדולה טובה לחברו י \" ע , לחברו טובה ועושה המשפיע הוא כי , להיפך אלא . להמשפיע חברו ואת , מתנה למקבל המיוחד קבלה כלי הוא והתאבון שהרעב שהגם , מוצא והנך . הזאת הטובה את ממנו קבלתו"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 141 היה לא ז \" עכ , חברו סעודת לקבל מספקת במדה ותאבון רעבון לו היה ההוא והאדם , לאכילה . הבושה מחמת , משהו אף אצלו לטעום יכול כלי בו להתרקם התחיל אז הרי , אותו ודוחה הולך והוא , בו להפציר מתחיל כשחברו אלא שהולכים בעת , שלו הדחיה וכחות חברו של ההפצרה כחות כי . האכילה על חדשים קבלה עד . השפעה למדת הקבלה מדת לו המהפכים , מספיק לשיעור להצטרף סופם , ומתרבים כלי לו נולדו אז אשר . אכילתו עם לחברו גדולה רוח ונחת טובה שיעשה , בעיניו לצייר שיוכל , הסעודה על קבלה כלי לעיקר נעשה שלו הדחיה שכח , עתה ונבחן . חבירו סעודת על קבלה . הרגילים קבלה כלי באמת שהם פ \" אע , והתאבון הרעב ולא 15) After the First Restriction, new vessels of reception appear in place of Behina Dalet. They are formed because of a Stroke Contact between the light and the screen. However, we still need to under- stand how this light turned into a vessel of reception after being the light reflected from such a vessel. It turns out that the light becomes a vessel, i.e., starts playing an opposite role. To explain the above, let us take an example from this world. Man naturally respects a “desire to give”, at the same time, he resents receiving without giving something in return. Let us suppose that a person comes to his friend’s house, and is offered a meal. Naturally, he would refuse to eat no matter how hungry he may be, because he hates to be a receiver who gives nothing in return. His host, however, starts persuading him, making it clear that by the guest's eating his food, he would please his host immensely. When the guest feels that what the host says is true, he will consent to accept the meal, since he would not feel as a receiver anymore. Moreover, now the guest feels he is giving to the host, delighting him with his readiness to eat. It turns out that in spite of his hunger - a genuine vessel of receiving food - the guest could not even touch the delicacies until his shame was placated by the host’s persuasions. Now we see how a new vessel for receiving the food comes to life. The gradually growing power of the host’s persuasion and the guest’s resistance finally turn reception into bestowal. The act of receiving"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 142 remained unchanged; only the intention was transformed. Just the force of resistance and not hunger (the true vessel of reception) turned into the reason for accepting the treat. Wherever Behina Dalet is mentioned, Malchut is meant, i.e., recep- tion for the sake of reception. There is an action and the reason of this action. What is the reason for reception before the Restriction? It is the desire to receive pleasure. It means that receiving is an action for the sake of receiving. After the Restriction, the Partzufim do not use Behina Dalet ; the only light received by it is that coming from the screen and the Reflected Light. The reason for receiving that existed before the Restriction re- mained afterwards too, because without a desire and striving for some- thing, it is impossible to receive. Nevertheless, this reason is not enough for reception; it should be accompanied by an additional reason i.e., the intention for the sake of bestowal. Malchut is ready to renounce animal pleasures; it performs the Restriction on them. It receives only because it is the Creator’s desire. According to that, reception for the sake of bestowal looks different. The act of receiving does not arise from the first reason, but from the second - receiving for the sake of giving; however, the first reason must accompany the second, for if there is no desire to receive pleasure, how will it be able to enjoy? For example, there is a commandment to enjoy the Sabbath meal; but if there is no hunger, how can one receive pleasure from eating? Hence the first reason - the “desire to receive” should remain (albeit because of the shame it is unable to receive), but only in the presence of the additional reason - the “desire to give”. על העולה ח \" האו ואת דהכאה הזווג ענין להבין אפשר לחברו אדם בין ל \" הנ ומדמיון ( טז אור של ההכאה ענין כי . ד \" בחי במקום העליון אור על חדשים קבלה כלי נעשה שהוא , ידו כי . אצלו לאכול ההפצרה לענין לדמותו יש , ד \" בחי אל להתפשט ורוצה בהמסך המכה , העליון וענין . למקבל להתפשט רוצה העליון אור כן , סעודתו את יקבל שחברו מאד רוצה שהוא כמו את לקבל חברו של והסירוב הדחיה לדבר לדמותו יש , לאחוריו ומחזירו באור המכה , המסך"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 143 נתהפכו והדחיה הסירוב דוקא אשר , כאן שתמצא וכמו . לאחור טובתו את דוחה כי . סעודתו י \" ע העולה , ח \" האו כי , לך לדמות תוכל כן , חברו סעודת את לקבל נכונים קבלה לכלי ונעשו במקום , העליון אור על חדשים קבלה לכלי שנעשה הוא , העליון אור את ודחיתו המסך הכאת .' א הצמצום מטרם קבלה לכלי ששמשה ד \" הבחי שבהם , ז \" ובעוה הקליפות בפרצופי לא אבל . ע \" דאבי הקדושה בפרצופי רק נתקן זה אמנם של הצורה שינוי כי , העליון מאור נפרדים הם כ \" וע . קבלה לכלי עצמה ד \" הבחי משמשת החיים מחיי נפרדים הם כי , למתים הרשעים וכן הקליפות נבחנים כ \" וע . אותם מפריד ד \" הבחי . שבהם לקבל הרצון י \" ע 16) With the help of the example of the host and the guest we can now understand what a Zivug de Haka’a (Stroke Contact) is, which results in the birth of new vessels of receiving the Upper Light instead of the Behina Dalet. The interaction takes place because the light hits the screen wishing to enter the Behina Dalet. It resembles a host who tries to convince his guest to eat. The force of the guest’s resistance is similar to the screen. As the refusal to eat turns into a new vessel, so does the Reflected Light become a vessel of receiving instead of the Behina Dalet, which played that role before the First Restriction. However, we should keep in mind that it happens only in the spiri- tual objects of the worlds of ABYA, whereas in the objects related to the impure forces and to our world, the Behina Dalet continues to be a receiving vessel. Hence neither in the impure forces nor in our world is there any light, because of the difference between the properties of the Behina Dalet and those of the Creator. Therefore, the Klipot (impure forces, a “desire to receive” the light without the screen) and sinners are called dead, since the desire to receive the light without the screen separates them from the Life of Lives, the Creator’s light."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 144 F I V E L E V E L S O F M A S A C H שבמסך בחינות ' ה המשכה הוא שהאור , וכלי אור ענין ' הא ; שבחכמה הראשונים יסודות ' ג הנה עד נתבאר והנה ( יז הרצון שבשיעור , ההוא באור בהכרח הכלול לקבל הרצון בחינת הוא והכלי ,' ית מעצמותו ישרה , העליון באור הנבחנת המלכות בחינת היא הזה לקבל והרצון . לנאצל מאציל מכלל יצא הזה ביאור הוא ,' הב ענין . רצון בגימטריא שמו כי , אחד ושמו הוא בסוד , שמו , מלכות ' נק כ \" וע על להשתלשל מחויב לקבל שהרצון . מזו למטה זו מדרגות ' ד שהם , ע \" אבי עולמות ' וד ס \" הע הזה הקבלה כלי על שנעשה ומסך הצמצום ענין הוא ,' הג ענין . תוכנו על כלי לקביעות עד ידיהן ' הג אלו היטב ושנן והבן . חוזר אור ' הנק ס \" בע חדשים קבלה כלי נתהוו ותמורתו , ד \" בחי שהוא . הזו בחכמה אחת במלה אף הבנה אין זולתם כי , לפניך שנתבארו כפי ונימוקיהם הם יסודות 17) The three basic definitions are now clear to us: 1) The Ohr is a direct emanation of the Creator’s light, while the Kli is a “desire to receive” created by the light. The light initially contains an unexpressed “desire to receive”, but as this desire develops, the vessel (Malchut) is separated from it. Malchut is called “His Name” (Shemo) (“He and His Name are one”). The numerical value of the word “Shemo” is identical to the word “Ratzon” (desire). 2) The 10 Sefirot or the 4 worlds of ABYA correspond to the 4 Behi- not (phases). They must be present in any created being. The “desire to receive”, or the Kli, “descends” from the Creator’s level through these 4 worlds and achieves its full development in our world. 3) The First Restriction and the Masach of Behina Dalet bring forth a new vessel instead of Behina Dalet. The vessel is an intention to bestow to the Creator, and is called “Ohr Hozer”. The quantity of the received light depends on the intensity of the desire. הזווג בעת הקומה שיעורי משתנים פיהם שעל , בהמסך שיש בחינות ' ה נבאר ועתה ( יח . העליון אור עם שעושה דהכאה על קבלה כלי מלהיות ד \" הבחי נפסלה הצמצום שלאחר פ \" אע כי , היטב תחלה להבין ויש היא ז \" עכ , בתמורתה קבלה לכלי נעשה , דהכאה זווג י \" ע מהמסך העולה ח \" והאו , ס \" הע"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 145 כלל מוכשר ח \" האו היה לא זה וזולת . ח \" האו אל שבה הקבלה כח עם להתלוות מוכרחת . קבלה כלי להיות , הסעודה לקבל והסירוב הדחיה כח אשר , שם הוכחנו כי . ו \" ט באות ל \" הנ מהמשל כ \" ג זה ותבין נפסלו , הרגילים קבלה כלי שהם , והתאבון הרעב כי . והתאבון הרעב במקום קבלה לכלי נעשה הדחיה כחות ורק . מחברו מתנה מקבל להיות והבזיון הבושה מחמת , קבלה כלי מלהיות כאן . השפעה להיות הקבלה נתהפכה והסירוב הדחיה מתוך כי . קבלה לכלי במקומם נעשו והסירוב אינו כבר שעתה , לומר אפשר אי ז \" ועכ . חברו סעודת לקבל מוכשרים קבלה כלי ידם על והשיג יוכל לא לאכילה תאבון שבלי , ברור זה כי . והתאבון הרעב שהם , הרגילים הקבלה לכלי צריך . אצלו אכילתו עם רוח נחת לו ולעשות חברו רצון למלאות כח מחמת , עתה נתגלגלו , הרגילה בצורתם שנפסלו , והתאבון הרעב כי , הוא הענין אלא להיות הבזיון נהפך ז \" ועי . להשפיע מ \" ע קבלה שהוא , חדשה צורה וקבלו , והסירוב הדחיה . חדשה צורה שקבלו אלא , תמיד כמו עתה פועלים עדיין הרגילים קבלה הכלי אשר , הרי . כבוד שהוא , ס \" הע על קבלה כלי מלהיות נפסלה ד \" שבחי הוא אמת כי : כאן בענינינו תקיש וכן . מהמשפיע המפריד , המשפיע כלפי הצורה שינוי שפירושו . שבה העוביות מחמת נתגלגלה הנה , לאחוריו ומחזירו העליון אור על המכה , ד \" בהבחי המסך תיקון י \" ע אמנם הקבלה צורת לגלגול בדומה ,\" ח \" או \" הנקראת , חדשה צורה וקבלה , הפסולה הקודמת צורתה בלי אוכל אינו עתה גם כי , שם נשתנה לא הראשונה צורה של התוכן אשר . השפעה בצורת . ח \" האו תוך ובא נתגלגל , ד \" בבחי שהיה הקבלה כח שהיא , העוביות כל , כאן גם כן . תאבון . קבלה כלי להיות מוכשר ח \" האו נעשה כ \" וע , העליון האור כלפי שבו הדחיה כח שהוא , קשיות . א : כחות ' ב בהמסך תמיד להבחין יש ולפיכך מכח דהכאה זווג י \" ע אשר , בהמסך הנכלל ד \" מבחי לקבל הרצון שיעור שהוא , עוביות . ב ' ב ואלו . להשפעה הקבלה התהפכות דהיינו , זכות להיות שבו העוביות נתהפכה , שבו הקושיות .\" כתר \" הנקרא ושורשם , מ \" תו ב \" חו הבחינות ' ד שהם , בחינות ' בה פועלים שבהמסך הכחות 18) We will now clarify the five Behinot of the screen according to which the size of the Kli is changed during the Stroke Contact with the Upper Light. After the First Restriction, Behina Dalet ceases to be a receiving ves- sel. The Reflected Light (Ohr Hozer), which rises above the screen because of the Stroke Contact, now plays that role instead. However, Behina Dalet with its powerful “desire to receive” has to accompany the Ohr Hozer. Without it, the Ohr Hozer is absolutely unable to be a vessel of reception. Remember the situation between the host and his guest. The guest’s force of refusal to eat has become a receiving vessel taking on the role of"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 146 hunger, which lost that function because of shame. During that refusal, receiving actually turns into an act of giving. However, we cannot say that the guest has no need for the usual vessels of receiving. Without them, he will not be able to please the host by eating his delicacies. By way of refusal, hunger (the “desire to receive”) acquires a new form – a “desire to receive” for the sake of bestowing to the host, the Creator. Shame has now become a merit. It turns out that the usual vessels of reception keep functioning as before, but acquire a new intention, i.e., to receive for the Creator’s sake. The coarseness of Behina Dalet, the state of being opposite to the Creator, prevents it now from being a receiving vessel. However, thanks to the screen set in Behina Dalet, which hits and reflects the light, it takes a new form called the Ohr Hozer – the Reflected Light – while receiving turns into giving, as in the example with the host and the guest. Nevertheless, the essence of the form remains the same, because the guest would not eat without an ap- petite. Yet all the power of Behina Dalet’s desire to receive pleasure is included in the Ohr Hozer, making it a proper vessel. There are two forces always present in the screen. The first is Kashiut, the force of resistance to receiving light; the second is Aviut, the force of Behina Dalet’s “desire to receive”. Because of a Stroke Contact of Kashiut with the light, Aviut totally changes its properties, turning reception into bestowal. The two forces function in all five parts of the screen: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Malchut. Five parts are in the screen through which it receives the light (five Zivugey de Haka’a) . The Ohr Hozer is not a genuine vessel; it can only as- Ohr Hozer is no t a genuine v essel; it can only as- Ohr Hozer sist in the receiving of light. The desire to receive pleasure, Behina Dalet , which was a vessel before the First Restriction, still retains that role; only its intention changes. The larger man’s egoism, the more light he is able to receive, pro- vided there is a screen matching his egoism. Instead of resenting his"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 147 unworthy desires, man should only ask the Creator for a screen that will correct those desires by making them altruistic. Oftentimes we know neither what motivates our actions nor what our real desires are. Sometimes we feel a need for something but have no idea what it is. Man is in a constant dream-like state until Kabbalah wakes him up and opens his eyes. Initially we do not even possess a genu- ine desire to receive pleasure. Kabbalah works with the spiritual desires, which are much more powerful than those of our world are. Thanks to the Kli ’s new intention, the “desire to receive” obtains a new form: a “desire to bestow”, or more precisely, a “desire to receive” for the sake of the Creator. Man now starts receiving in order to please the Creator. Upon discovering the difference between its own properties and the Creator’s, Behina Dalet feels shame. The screen set up by Malchut reflects the light and thus changes the intention. The essence of the “de- sire to receive” remains, but now it is receiving for the Creator’s sake. Kabbalah is a logical science. Every phenomenon leads to a certain consequence, which in turn becomes a reason for the next, thus forming a chain of cause and effect connections. Our problem, however, consists in that we are not yet really connected to what we study. While reading about the spiritual worlds, the Partzufim and the Sefirot , we cannot yet feel them. There are two levels in Kabbalah studies. The first is for beginners, when there is no sensation of the material studied. After further study though, a Kabbalist receives a feeling of the phenomena and terms de- scribed in the book. One should point out that the light is actually motionless; it nei- ther enters anything nor exits from anywhere. However, depending on its inner properties, the vessel feels the light differently, distinguishing in it different “tastes” or pleasures. If the vessel enjoys direct reception of the light, then such pleasure is called Ohr Hochma. If the creation re- ceives pleasure from the likeness of its properties to those of the Creator,"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 148 then this kind of delight is called Ohr Hassadim. The alternate reception of either Ohr Hochma or Ohr Hassadim creates “movement”. When man starts on his spiritual path, he initially realizes how evil his nature is. This thought leads him to the beginning of correction. As a result, he ascends, starts feeling more and more subtle influences of the supreme forces. The light descending from the Creator after the First Restriction represents a narrow ray of light coming from Infinity to the central point of the universe. All spiritual worlds (AK and (AK and (AK ABYA) are dressed onto this ray. From the point of the Creator’s influence, we are at the very center of all the worlds. The Creator’s personal providence is implemented with the help of the light ray. This ray descends to a certain soul, dressing it in all the worlds, starting from Adam Kadmon (AK), then continuing to Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira and the outermost, Assiya. A common person differs from a Kabbalist by the fact that he has no screen, hence he cannot feel, reflect the light, or create his own spiri- tual vessel. Such a vessel is Toch, the inner part of the Partzuf where the Partzuf wher e the Partzuf creation receives the Creator’s light. Strictly speaking, what we call the Creator is His light, since we are unable to attain the Creator’s Essence. The Creator influences all people as though they had never left the world of Infinity ( Ein Sof ), i.e., they are in an unconscious state. Ein Sof ), i.e., the y ar e in an unconscious s t at e. Ein Sof Such an influence is called “ Derech Igulim ”, with the help of circles and spheres, i.e., through the general light surrounding the entire creation. The spreading of the light in the form of a circle signifies the absence of a limiting force, the screen. Man’s task is to take into his own hands a partial control over his destiny, thereby becoming the Creator’s partner. Then the Creator will no longer treat him as He does all other creatures, but individually, with the help of the light ray ( Derech Kav ). In this case, man himself takes control instead of the Creator."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 149 ד \" הבחי רק אלא , כלי לבחינת עוד נחשבות אינן הראשונות בחינות ' שג שביארנו הגם כי ( יט , ד \" הבחי להשלמת וגורמות סבות הן הראשונות בחינות ' שג מתוך ז \" עכ , לכלי נחשבת לבדה , א \" מבחי החל : שבה הקבלה במדת שעורים ' ד בה נתרשמו , שנשלמה אחר ד \" שהבחי באופן א \" מבחי ביותר עב משהו שהיא , ב \" בחי כ \" ואח , הקבלה ממדת שבה קלוש היותר שיעור שהוא . שבה הקבלה במדת עצמה בחינתה שהיא , ד \" בחי ולבסוף , שבה הקבלה במדת ב \" מבחי יותר העבה , ג \" בחי כ \" ואח אשר , עוד בה להבחין יש גם . תוכנה בכל מושלמת שלה הקבלה שמדת , מכולם יותר העבה הכלולות הקבלה בחינות ' ה הן ואלו . מכולם הזך שהוא , בה כלול בחינות ' הד של השורש גם ב \" חו הם בחינות ' הד כי . ד \" בבחי הכלולות , מ \" תו ב \" כח ס \" הע בשמות כ \" ג ונקראות . ד \" בבחי .\" כתר \" נקרא והשורש מ \" תו 19) As stated, the three first Behinot are not considered vessels yet. Only Behina Dalet is a true vessel. Since these three first Behinot are the reasons, phases preceding the creation of Behina Dalet, it ad- opted their properties upon completion of its development. They were somewhat imprinted in it, creating inside of Behina Dalet its own four levels of the “desire to receive”. Everything begins with the Be- hina Aleph, the “purest”, “weakest” “desire to receive”. Then follows the Behina Bet, which is a bit “coarser” and has a bigger Aviut than the Behina Aleph, i.e., it is a higher level of the “desire to receive”. Behina Gimel has an Aviut even greater than that of the Behina Bet. Finally comes the turn of the Behina Dalet, which has the larg- est Aviut, i.e., the greatest “desire to receive”. Its desire reached the highest, most perfect and ultimate level. It should be pointed out that the root (Shoresh) of these four Behinot is Keter (known as the high- est of all and the closest to the Creator), which also left its imprint in Behina Dalet. Thus we mentioned all five levels of the “desire to receive” included in Behina Dalet, which are otherwise called Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet and Malchut. The three Behinot preceding Malchut are called “the light”; only Malchut is the Kli , for it wants to receive for its own sake.As a result, it becomes a separate independent part. The previous Behinot are not sepa- rated from the Creator; hence, they are defined as the light."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 150 When the last phase or Malchut is completely filled with the light, it begins to feel the properties of all the preceding Behinot: first the adja- cent Tifferet, then Hochma, which created Bina, then the source ( Shoresh ) and finally the overall Thought – Keter. This means that all the previous properties of all the Behinot are included in Malchut and influence it. It is then Dalet de Dalet (i.e., the last part – Dalet of the entire Dalet ) and all the previous properties it ac- quired from the light. Apprehending the light that fills it, Behina Dalet at- tains the Creator’s greatness . It discovers in itself the striving to become similar to the “desire to bestow”; to the way the Creator does it. What is “to bestow”? The Creator is the source of the light. The Kli cannot bestow anything; it can only intend to do so. The Creator created the “desire to receive”, the rest being just different degrees of it. Only an intention can change from “for one’s own sake” to “for the sake of the Creator”. What is the difference between Aviut Keter and Aviut Bina ? Are they not both called “the “desire to bestow””? Keter is the “desire to give”, Keter is the “desir e t o giv e”, Keter Hochma receives, and Bina, upon receiving the light, returns it to the Cre- ator. This can be understood from the example taken from the Mishna. “Man studies the Torah for the sake of the Creator” means that he re- fuses to receive anything that corresponds to Aviut Keter. “The Torah se- crets are revealed to him” means that he did not ask for this, but received them from above – from Behinat Hochma. Upon receiving, man has to overcome himself and say, “I refuse it, because all I want is to bestow”. Now look what a difference it makes: man wishes to give after receiving the light or before receiving it! ד \" הבחי כי , הוא מ \" תו ב \" כח הספירות בשם נקראות ד \" שבבחי הקבלה בחינות ' שה ומה ( כ העליון באור הכלולות ס \" הע על הקבלה כלי היתה ד \" שהבחי בעוד דהיינו , הצמצום מטרם פ \" ע ס \" להע הלבשתה שם נבחן , שם נכללים העולמות כל כי ,\" אחד ושמו אחד הוא \" בסוד . הבחינות ' ה אותן בחינת כי : העליון שבאור ס \" בהע שכנגדה הבחינה הלבישה שבה הבחינות ' מה בחינה שכל החכמה לאור הלבישה ד \" שבבחי א \" ובחי , ס \" שבע הכתר לאור הלבישה ' ד שבבחינה השורש"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 151 , ת \" הת לאור הלבישה שבה ג \" ובחי , הבינה לאור הלבישה שבה ב \" ובחי , ספירות שבעשר ד \" שהבחי אחר ,' א הצמצום אחר עתה גם ולפיכך . המלכות לאור הלבישה עצמה ובחינתה הספירות ' ה שם על שבה העוביות בחינות ' ה כ \" ג נקראות , קבלה כלי עוד מלהיות נפסלה . מ \" תו ב \" כח 20) The five levels of the “desire to receive” included in Behina Dalet are called by the names of the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light because Behina Dalet was a vessel receiving this light before TA (“He and His Name are One”). All the worlds, the entire Universe, was in- cluded in Behina Dalet of the Direct Light (Malchut of the world of Infinity). Each Behina contained in Malchut adopted the properties of the corresponding Behina in the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light. Behina Shoresh of the Behina Dalet adopted the properties of Keter, “dressed in it”, one of the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light. Behina Aleph of the Behina Dalet “dressed” into the light of Hochma of the 10 Sefirot, and so on. Even after TA, when Behina Dalet ceased to be a vessel of reception, its five levels of the “desire to receive” still bear the names of the five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Malchut. We are Behina Dalet de Dalet , whereas all the preceding four Sefirot are the worlds. By interacting with the worlds, we can receive their prop- erties in order to correct the Behina Dalet . All the worlds are inside of us, as well as all spiritual work. Our task is to feel the Creator’s light as Malchut did in the world of Infinity and thus get corrected. What does it mean that Behina Dalet attains the properties of the preceding Behinot ? It means that it begins to feel that, with the ex- ception of the “desire to receive”, there is also the “desire to bestow”, which was absent in it. Malchut still wants to receive pleasure; however, it is now imbued with the “desire to give”; i.e., it now strives to receive delight from giving. The properties and desires inside the Kli gradually change from a yearning for simple reception of the light to a “desire to give” everything."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 152 These changes are caused by the light; the Kli ’s behavior depends solely on this influence. We study the 10 Sefirot , the 10 aspects of the relationship between the Creator and the creation. First, Malchut completely reflects the light, and then it calculates how much it can receive inside. If it worked with all its five desires, it could receive the light in all its five parts. If Malchut does not have enough anti-egoistic force to receive all the light for the Creator’s sake, it receives only that portion out of five parts of the light for which it has a screen. The ability to withstand the desires to receive pleasure is termed willpower. The force of resistance in the screen is called rigidity (Kashiut). The intensity of the desire to receive pleasure, the passion for fulfillment, is called thickness (Aviut). Inside the screen, two of Malchut ’s properties collide: these are “reception” and the screen’s anti-egoistic force of “be- stowal”. If my egoistic “desire to receive”, has an Aviut that equals 100%, and a force of resistance or rigidity, that equals only 20%, then I can re- ceive for the Creator’s sake no more than 20%. Only Kashiut determines what amount of egoism I may use. After TA, Malchut wants to change only the method of applying its desire. Malchut understands its “egoism”, it realizes that the “desire to receive” is its nature. However, this property is not negative; everything depends solely on the method of its use. The sensation of the Creator’s properties, of the “desire to bestow” and of the previous Behinot arises inside the egoistic desire (Behina Dalet). Now Malchut only has to become like them, i.e., it must makeits desire to receive pleasure similar to theirs. For that purpose, it pushes the entire light away from its egoism by performing Tzimtzum (Restriction) on itself. It then calculates to what extent it can assimilate the Creator’s properties – Behinot 0, 1, 2, and 3. The screen knows exactly how much light it may let in according to its egoism. The screen’s Kashiut, its will power, the force of resisting"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 153 temptation to receive pleasure, must match precisely its Aviut, the “desire to receive”. The memories left from the previous state of being filled with the light, which help Malchut calculate her future actions, are called “a record” or “a memory” ( the Reshimot). Spiritual attainment is called investing. , מאד קשה דבר כמו שפירושו ,\" קשיות \" בהשם מתבאר בכללו המסך שחומר , ידעת וכבר ( כא העליון מאור משהו מניח אינו המסך כן . גבולו תוך במשהו לדחוק שהוא למי מניח שאינו להתלבש הראוי האור שיעור שכל , נבחן זה שעם . ד \" בחי שהיא , המלכות אל דרכו לעבור העביות בחינות ' ה שאותן , נתבאר גם . לאחוריו ומחזירו המסך עליו מעכב , המלכות בכלי ' ה בהמסך נבחנים ולפיכך . שבו הקשיות במדת ומתחברות בהמסך ובאות נכללות , ד \" שבבחי . שבו עביות שיעורי ' ה פ \" ע דהכאה זווגים של מינים ס \" הע להלביש המספיק ח \" או מעלה , העביות בחינות ' ה מכל שלם מסך על דהכאה שזווג עביות רק בו שאין , ד \" דבחי מעביות החסר מסך על דהכאה וזווג , כתר קומת עד דהיינו , כולן . מכתר וחסר , חכמה קומת עד רק ס \" הע להלביש מספיק , מעלה שהוא ח \" האו הנה , ג \" דבחי רק ס \" הע להלביש מספיק ואינו יותר קטן שלו ח \" או הנה , ב \" דבחי עביות אלא בו אין ואם מוקטן שלו ח \" האו הנה , א \" דבחי עביות אלא בו אין ואם , חכמה מכתר וחסר , בינה קומת עד , א \" דבחי מעביות גם חסר הוא ואם , ב \" מכח וחסר , ת \" ת לקומת עד רק להלביש ומספיק , יותר רק להלביש ומספיק , מאוד קלושה שלו ההכאה הנה , שורש דבחינת עביות אלא בו נשאר ולא . ת \" ות ב \" כח שהם , הראשונות ס \" מט וחסר , בלבדה מלכות לקומת 21) We have already learned that the screen’s material is called Kashiut. It is similar to a solid body that does not allow anything to enter it. Likewise, the screen prevents the Upper Light from entering Malchut, i.e., Behina Dalet. The screen stops and reflects all the light that was destined to fill Malchut. The five Behinot of Aviut in Behina Dalet are included in the screen according to its kashiut. Hence, the screen performs five Stroke Contacts (Zivugey de Haka’a) with the light according to its five Behinot of Aviut. The light reflected by the screen, consisting of all the five Behinot of Aviut, rises back, envelops the coming light and reaches its source, the Behina Shoresh. However, if only 4 out of 5 parts of the Aviut are present in the screen, then its Reflected Light will “see” only four portions of pleasure."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 154 In the absence of Behinot Dalet and Gimel, the 5-th and the 4-th parts of rigidity in the screen, it can reflect the Ohr Hozer only up to the level of Bina. If there is only the Behina Aleph in the screen, then its Ohr Hozer is very small and can envelop the Direct Light only up to the level of Tifferet in the absence of Keter, Hochma, and Bina. If there is only the Behina Shoresh of Kashiut in the screen, then its resisting power is quite weak and the Ohr Hozer can envelop Malchut’s coming light, while the nine first Sefirot are absent. The screen is characterized by two properties. One of them is Kashiut (strength); it does not let the light enter Malchut. Any measure of the light that comes to the screen is pushed back and reflected. The second property of Masach is its coarseness, egoism, Aviut ( thickness). This is what can be added to the strength of the screen of Behina Dalet and be used for reception for the Creator’s sake. Since there are five desires for five kinds of pleasure in Malchut , it reflects all of them, thus avoiding the egoistic reception of pleasure. The screen is like a curtain that I can draw when the sunlight dis- turbs me. In the material world, we know of what material a curtain is made. In the spiritual world, the material of the screen is called “Kashiut” , which is its strength, hardness, or rigidity. One describes as“very hard, tough” a person who does not accept other people’s opinions but sticks vehemently to his own. The conclusion: The Creator (the “desire to bestow” delight upon created beings) prepared the “desire to receive” and wishes to fill it. How- ever, the creation is adamant in its decision to receive nothing for its own sake. This is the purpose of the screen. Here we need to make an important note: there is no restriction of the desire! If man sees pleasure before him, he instantly wants to receive it in full. However, he can only receive by applying the intention for the sake of bestowal; but this does not mean that the “desire to receive” the entire pleasure is absent in him. Now we can formulate a law: man makes"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 155 a restriction on the pleasure he cannot refuse and receives the pleasure he can give up. For example, man says to his body on Yom Kippur; “Know that today you must not receive food, so don’t feel the hunger!” Nevertheless, his body does not listen... Why is it designed in such a way? The Creator created the “desire to receive”; therefore, it is invariable. If this desire disappears, then man is no longer alive. Some people speak about the elimination of desires. Here is what Rabbi Israel from Ruzhin said in this connection: “He, who eliminated one desire, will receive two instead”. It is impossible and unnecessary to eliminate the “desire to receive”; one should pray for an opportunity to use it with the intention for the Creator’s sake. The difference between created beings depends on the size of the “desire to receive”. Someone with big aspirations is called big; someone with a small “desire to receive” is called small. My spiritual level is determined by how completely my Reflected Light can envelop the entire Direct Light coming to me, all the plea- sures anticipated by me, so that I would be able to receive them for the Creator’s sake. I can be on the level of Malchut, ZA, Bina , or maybe even Hochma or Keter . Malchut of the world of Infinity divides into many parts, but they all differ from one another only by the screen’s properties. In the world of Assiya, Malchut is similar to the Creator in perhaps 20%, 40% in the world of Yetzira, 60% in the world of Beria, 80% in the world of Atzilut , and in the world of Adam Kadmon (AK) Malchut is 100% equal to the Creator. The levels differ only by the strength of their screen. There is no screen in our world. Hence, we cannot feel the Creator and exist in an absolutely empty space. As soon as man acquires the screen, he already starts feeling the spiritual world on the lowest level of the world of Assiya. We ascend with the help of increasing the strength of the screen."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 156 What is the transition from one spiritual level to another? It means to acquire the properties of a new, higher level. If at a certain level, man can increase his screen’s magnitude; this can elevate him to the next level. The higher the level is, the more different is the sensation, the at- tainment of the universe. We have said that when there are five Behinot of Aviut in the screen, the Ohr Hozer reaches the highest level (the light of Keter , Ohr Yechida ). Then the Kli receives all the lights : Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Mal- chut from all the preceding Behinot . In the absence of the coarsest Behina ( Dalet ) in the screen, i.e., the intention for the Creator’s sake on the most intense desires, the highest light ( Keter, Yechida ) is also absent in the Kli, while the screen reaches the level of the light of Hochma (Ohr Haya). In the absence of Aviut Dalet and Gimel in the screen, the lights of Keter and Hochma (Ohr Yechida and Haya) are absent in the Kli ; it works with Aviut Bet and the light of Bina (Ohr Neshama). If the Aviut of the screen is Aleph , then the lights of Tifferet and Mal- chut (Ohr Ruach and Nefesh) are present. Finally, the screen with the Aviut Shoresh raises the Ohr Hozer only up to the level of the light of Malchut (Ohr Nefesh) , and only this light is present in the Kli . To make it easier, we usually say that the Masach is set before Malchut , although we have to understand that the Masach spreads over the entire Malchut , over all the desires of the Kli . Why is the highest light missing in the absence of Aviut Dalet ? It happens because there is an inverse relationship between the Ohr and Ohr and Ohr the Kli, the light and the vessel. If the screen has a maximum Aviut, it raises the Ohr Hozer to the highest level, i.e., to the light of Keter to the highest level, i.e., to the light of K e t er to the highest level, i.e., to the light of . It means that with the “strongest” screen, the Ohr Hozer can envelop all pleasures standing before the screen and let them inside the Partzuf."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 157 , המסך של דהכאה זווג מיני ' ה י \" ע יוצאים ס \" ע של קומות שיעורי ' ה איך רואה והנך ( כב מושג אור שאין נודע כי , הדברים טעם אודיעך ועתה . שבו עוביות בחינות ' ה על המשוערים . כלי בלי הצמצום שמטרם , ד \" שבבחי העוביות בחינות ' מה באות , הללו עוביות בחינות ' שה ידעת גם ' בה נכללו ' א הצמצום ואחר ,( ח \" י אות ) מ \" תו ב \" כח ס \" להע שהלבישו , ד \" בהבחי כלים ' ה היו ח \" או מבחינת כלים ' ה להיות חוזרים הם , מעלה שהוא ח \" האו עם אשר , המסך של בחינות . הצמצום שמטרם עצמה ד \" שבבחי כלים ' הה במקום , מ \" תו ב \" כח ס \" הע על להלבשת כלים ' ה בו יש אז , הללו עביות בחינות ' ה כל במסך יש שאם , מאליו מובן זה פי ועל . כלים ' ד אלא בו אין הרי , ד \" דבחי העביות לו חסר כי , בחינות ' הה כל בו שאין בעת אבל . ס \" הע כמו , הכתר אור שהוא , אחד מאור חסר והוא . מ \" תו ב \" חו אורות ' ד רק להלביש יכול אינו כ \" וע . ד \" דבחי העביות שהוא , אחד כלי לו שחסר הרי , ב \" בחי עד רק דהיינו , עביות בחינות ' ג רק בהמסך שאין , ג \" בחי גם בו שחסר בעת כן וכמו והקומה . ומלכות ת \" ת בינה שהם , אורות ' ג רק להלביש יכול אינו כ \" וע . כלים ' ג רק בו אין אז . ד \" ובחי ג \" בחי הכלים ' מב שחסרה כמו , וחכמה כתר האורות ' מב אז חסרה אלא בו אין הרי , א \" ומבחי שורש מבחינת דהיינו , עוביות בחינות ' ב רק בהמסך שאין ובעת חסרה הקומה ונמצאת . מלכות ואור ת \" ת אור שהם , אורות ' ב רק מלביש אינו כ \" וע . כלים ' ב . ד \" ובחי ג \" ובחי ב \" בחי שהם , הכלים ' ג שחסרה כמו , ב \" כח אורות ' מג אלא לו אין הרי , לבד העביות שורש בחינת שהיא , דעביות אחת בחינה רק בהמסך שאין ובעת אורות ' מד חסרה זו וקומה . המלכות אור שהוא , אחד אור רק להלביש יכול אינו לכן . אחד כלי . א \" ודבחי ב \" ודבחי ג \" ודבחי ד \" דבחי עוביות שהם , הכלים ' מד שחסרה כמו , ת \" ות ב \" כח שהמסך : במסך שיש העביות בשיעור נמרץ בדיוק תלוי פרצוף כל של הקומה ששיעור הרי א \" ודבחי , בינה קומת מוציא ב \" ודבחי , חכמה קומת מוציא ג \" ודבחי , כתר קומת מוציא ד \" דבחי . מלכות קומת מוציא שורש ודבחינת , ת \" ת קומת מוציא 22) The five levels (Behinot) of the 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light emerge because of five kinds of Zivugey de Haka’a (Stroke Contact) of the Upper Light with the five levels of the screen’s Aviut. This light is not perceived or attained by anyone if there is no vessel to receive it. These five phases emerge from five Behinot of Aviut of Behina Dalet, which were five receiving vessels of Behina Dalet before TA; they en- veloped the 10 Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Malchut. After TA, these same five Behinot merge with the five Behinot of the screen, and with the help of the Reflected Light again become receiv-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 158 ing vessels instead of the five Behinot of Behina Dalet, which played that role before TA. Now we can understand that if the screen has all these five Behinot of Aviut, then it possesses five vessels for enveloping the 10 Sefirot, i.e., for receiving the Upper Light. If the Aviut of the Behina Dalet is absent in the screen, it has only four vessels and can receive only the four lights corresponding to Hochma, Bina, Tifferet and Malchut but cannot receive the light of Keter. If the Aviut of Behina Gimel is absent in the screen, it has only three vessels and can receive only the three lights corresponding to Bina, Tifferet and Malchut. The lights corresponding to Keter and Hochma as well as the vessels corresponding to Behinot Gimel and Dalet are absent in it. If the screen has only two levels of Aviut, Shoresh, and Behina Aleph, it possesses only the two vessels corresponding to the lights of Tifferet and Malchut. It turns out that such a Partzuf lacks the three lights of Keter, Hochma and Bina, as well as the three vessels corresponding to Behinot Bet, Gimel, and Dalet. If the screen has only Aviut Shoresh, then it has only one vessel with only the light of Malchut (Nefesh). The remaining lights, Keter, Hochma, Tifferet and Malchut, are absent in it. Therefore, the size of each Partzuf depends only on the screen’s Aviut (thickness). The screen with the Aviut of Behina Dalet creates a Partzuf consisting of five levels including Keter. The screen with Aviut of Behina Gimel creates a Partzuf consisting of four levels up to Hochma, and so on. There are five levels of the desire to receive pleasure in the screen, i.e., 5 levels of anti-egoistic force of resistance to pleasure. Two of its forces, thickness ( Aviut) ( A viut) ( and strength ( Kashiut ), must be balanced.Then Malchut has the freedom of will and can make its own decisions, since it is independent of its own desires and pleasures."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 159 The Ohr Yashar is equal to the Ohr Hozer, which means that the cre- ation wishes to bestow upon the Creator the very pleasure He prepared for it. The Ohr Hozer (intention) dresses, as it were, on the Creator’s Ohr Hozer (int ention) dr esses, as it w er e, on the Cr eat or’s Ohr Hozer delight; this demonstrates that the Kli does not want it for itself, but returns the delight to Him. In the absence of one more desire (the absence of the “desire to bestow” is meant and not an egoistic “desire to receive”, since the lat- ter never disappears), Gimel , the screen can envelop only three lights in its Reflected Light. Therefore, it will not be able “to see” the lights of Yechida and Haya . That is why we cannot feel the Creator’s light in our world. Initially we do not possess the screen and the light reflected by it without which it is impossible to see or feel the Creator’s light. The amount of the Reflected Light depends on the screen’s strength: the stronger the screen, the higher the level of the Reflected Light, the farther the Kli sees and the more it can receive for the Cre- ator’s sake. As the screen grows weaker, the Kli sees less and accordingly can receive less for the Creator’s sake. There are no changes in the screen. All changes are only in Aviut . The screen is the force of resistance to egoism; it is present in each prop- erty. The difference is in the Aviut, in the number of egoistic desires provided with the screen. We study only four levels of Aviut, since Keter has no Aviut (the “desire to receive”); it only wants to bestow. The desire to give pleasure to the created beings – Keter – called Keter – called Keter forth the “desire to receive” in the lower Sefirot ; therefore, Keter is a root Keter is a r oo t Keter of Aviut. When the lower spiritual object is unable to receive with the intention for the sake of the Creator, it uses the Aviut Shoresh, i.e., it can perform only acts of giving with the intention for the Creator’s sake. There are the light – pleasure, the Kli – the “desire to receive” and the screen – the force of resisting pleasure. The Kli creates the screen to become like the Creator. There is nothing else in the entire universe!"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 160 One should constantly remember this and try to interpret Kabbalah with the help of these three components. We cannot feel any spiritual pleasures because we lack even a mini- mal screen. The screen’s will power determines with what pleasure the Kabbalist works. After TA the Kli includes not just the “desire to receive” but also the “desire to receive” with the screen, i.e., not for self-satisfac- tion, but for the Creator. When there is no screen for a certain desire, it means a Kabbalist can- not work with it, i.e., it is unfit to be filled with the light; hence we say it is absent. It does not disappear; it is just not worked with. The spiritual level ( Koma ) of a Partzuf depends on the intensity of desire fitted to the screen. Partzuf d e p e n d s o n t h e i n t e n s i t y o f d e s i r e f i t t e d t o t h e s c r e e n . Partzuf The opposition to the most intense desire – Dalet , gives birth to the Partzuf of the highest level – Partzuf of the highes t lev el – Partzuf Keter . The opposition to the desire of the level Gimel gives birth to the Partzuf of Partzuf of Partzuf Hochma , which is one step below Keter . The force of opposition to the desire Bet creates the Partzuf of the level of Bina , a step lower than the preceding one, i.e., it can liken itself to the Creator even less than with the screen Gimel. If the screen can resist the desire - Aleph , it means that the Kabbal- ist’s spiritual level is Tifferet . If it can resist the smallest desire - Shoresh, then it gives birth to the tiniest Partzuf, Malchut. Egoistic desires should be used only to the extent of the will power to resist them. One cannot work with uncorrected desires without the screen; they should be neutralized and restricted. Desires neither appear nor dis- appear; they are created by the Creator. Only their use depends on man. Everything depends on the screen’s force of resistance, the inten- tion, which turns a receiver into a giver. That is what the “game” between the Creator and the creation is all about: transforming an egoistic desire into an altruistic one, i.e., directing it towards the Creator. All desires are in Malchut of the world of Infinity; it uses them in accordance with the screen, which emerges in it in each case. There are screens with the help of which Malchut builds worlds and those that"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 161 form various Partzufim . Certain types of screens promote the appearance of souls. These are all parts of Malchut of the world of Infinity. Giving up a certain pleasure is easier than receiving it from some- one who gives it to you. One can always receive less light for the sake of the Creator than one can give up. Or one can choose not to “work” with it at all. If a Kli decides to receive egoistically, i.e., has a desire without a screen, the light first approaches the Kli (the Kli attracts the light), but as soon as the light wishes to get inside it, the law of TA snaps into action and the light retreats. When Malchut or the world of Infinity performed TA , the Cre- ator accepted this law. Hence, we cannot openly use our egoism. We are under the influence of this law; therefore, we cannot feel any spiritual pleasures until we succeed in creating a screen for them. In addition, what are the pleasures of this world? They constitute the micro-dose of the light ( the ( t h e ( Ner Dakik) of the entire Malchut of the world Malchut o f t h e w o r l d Malchut of Infinity, which was allowed to be felt by us and can exist outside TA . Transcending this world is possible only through acquiring the screen. If there is the screen for a greater pleasure, then it is also avail- able for a smaller one. In order to stop receiving delight for oneself, one should add an intention to that pleasure ( the Ohr Hozer) and receive it for the sake of the Giver. Movement in the spiritual world occurs only because of a strength- ening or weakening of the screen. The entire creation, Malchut of the world of Infinity, gradually acquires the screen for all of its desires. When all of Malchut’s desires are fitted with the screen, it will achieve the state of “the Final Correction” ( the Gmar Tikkun). This is the meaning of all of creation’s actions. The creation of the screen, its interaction with the light, the Ohr Hozer enveloping the light, is called “a commandment”, a Mitzvah. The received light is called “the Torah”. Overall there are 620 levels, steps,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 162 measures of the screen’s interaction with the light so as to receive all the light particles in all Malchut’s desires. When Malchut is completely filled with the Creator’s light, it means it has received the entire Torah and has achieved perfection. מאור נחסר הוא , ד \" בחי שהוא , בהמסך מלכות כלי בחוסר למה : לבאר נשאר עוד אמנם ( כג : בהיפך להיות צריך היה ולכאורה ?' וכו חכמה מאור נחסר , ת \" הת כלי גם ובחוסר ? הכתר אורות ' ד בה ויהיו , מלכות אור רק בקומה יחסר , ד \" בחי שהיא , במסך מלכות כלי שבחוסר בקומה ויהיה , ומלכות ת \" מת האורות יחסרו , ד \" ובחי ג \" בחי כלים ' ב בחוסר וכן ? ת \" ות ב \" לכח . ז \" עד ' וכו ? ב \" לכח אורות ' ג 23) We need to understand why, in the absence of the vessel of Mal- chut, the light of Keter is missing, and why the light of Hochma is missing when the vessel of Tifferet is also absent.On the face of it, everything should be the other way around.If the Aviut of the Behina Dalet is absent in the screen, then the light of Malchut (Nefesh) should be missing. If two vessels are absent –Behina Gimel and Behi- na Dalet - the lights of Tifferet and Malchut should also be missing. Supposedly, if there is no force of resistance for the greatest desire (Malchut), then the light of Malchut should presumably be missing, i.e., Malchut s h o u l d p r e s u m a b l y b e m i s s i n g , i . e . , Malchut the light that fills this desire. Then why do we claim that the greatest light (Keter) is missing in this case? Is this not the light, which fills Behina Keter? This can be explained by the inverse relationship between the light and the vessel, i.e., first the smallest desire (Keter) is filled with the small- est light of Malchut (Nefesh), so far unrelated to the formed Kli and tem- porarily taking its place. However, as the desire gradually grows, or rather by acquiring the screen for more desires, greater lights fill the Kli Keter. Meanwhile Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Malchut are filled with the vari- ous lights until Malchut is finally filled with the light of Nefesh is finally filled with the light of N ef esh is finally filled with the light of and Keter - with the light of Yechida. with the light of Y ec hida. with the light of שהכלים , הוא הכלים מדרך כי . לכלים אורות בין הפכי ערך תמיד יש כי , היא והתשובה ( כד שכלי עד ,' וכו דחכמה הכלי ואחריו , הכתר נגדל שמתחלה . בפרצוף תחילה נגדלים העליונים . באחרונה נגדל המלכות"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 163 אליהם והפכי . גידולם טבע כן כי , למטה מלמעלה מ \" תו ב \" כח בסדר לכלים מכנים אנו כ \" וע , הנפש נכנס מתחילה כי . בפרצוף תחלה נכנסים התחתונים האורות , באורות כי , האורות . באחרונה נכנס היחידה שאור עד ,' וכו א \" הז אור שהוא , הרוח כ \" ואח , המלכות אור שהוא . לעילא מתתא כניסתם סדר כן כי , למעלה ממטה י \" נרנח בסדר לאורות מכנים אנו כ \" וע לא אז הנה , כתר העליון כלי בהכרח שהוא , אחד כלי רק בפרצוף נגדל לא שעוד בעת , באופן אור שהוא , מכולם התחתון אור רק אלא , ההוא לכלי המיוחס , היחידה אור בפרצוף נכנס . דכתר בכלי מתלבש הנפש ואור , הנפש , הרוח אור גם בו נכנס אז הנה , וחכמה כתר העליונים ' ב שהם , בפרצוף כלים ' ב וכשנגדלו כשנגדל וכן . דכתר בכלי מתלבש הרוח ואור , דחכמה כלי אל דכתר מכלי הנפש אור אז ויורד דחכמה מכלי הנפש אור יורד ואז . נשמה אור בו נכנס אז , הבינה כלי שהוא , בפרצוף ' ג כלי . דכתר בכלי מתלבש הנשמה ואור , דחכמה לכלי הרוח ואור , דבינה לכלי מכלי הנפש אור יורד ואז . החיה אור בפרצוף נכנס הנה , ת \" דת כלי שהוא ,' ד כלי בפרצוף וכשנגדל . דכתר בכלי החיה ואור , דחכמה לכלי הנשמה ואור , דבינה לכלי הרוח ואור , ת \" דת לכלי דבינה האורות כל באים ואז . היחידה אור בו נכנס , מלכות כלי שהוא , בפרצוף חמישי כלי וכשנגדל , ת \" דת לכלי הרוח ואור , דמלכות לכלי ת \" דת מהכלי יורד הנפש אור כי . להם המיוחסים בכלים . דכתר לכלי היחידה ואור , דחכמה לכלי החיה ואור , דבינה לכלי הנשמה ואור 24) The fact is that there is an inverse relationship between the lights and the vessels. First, the higher vessels emerge and start growing in the Partzuf, from Keter and down to Hochma and so on until Malchut. Hence we call the vessels according to the order of their growth: Ket- er, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet and Malchut (KaHaB-TuM), from up downwards. The lights enter the Partzuf in an opposite order, first the lower ones: the lowest light – Nefesh (its place is inside Malchut), then Ruach (Zeir Anpin’s light) and so on until Yechida. Hence, we name the lights in the following order: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida (NaRaNHaY), from down upwards, according to the order of their entering into the Partzuf. When the Partzuf has only one vessel (this can be only Keter), the first light to enter it is not Yechida, which must be inside it, but Nefesh, the lowest light."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 164 When two higher vessels, Keter and Hochma, emerge in the Partzuf, then the light Ruach also enters it. The light Nefesh exits the vessel Keter and descends to the vessel Hochma, whereas the light Ruach enters the vessel Keter. When the third vessel Bina emerges in the Partzuf, the light Nefesh exits the vessel Hochma and descends to the vessel Bina, while the light Ruach descends to the vessel Hochma and the light Neshama enters the vessel Keter. When the fourth vessel Tifferet emerges in the Partzuf, the light Haya enters it; the light Nefesh exits the vessel Bina and descends to the vessel Tifferet. While the light Ruach descends to the vessel Bina, the light Neshama enters the vessel Hochma and the light Haya enters the vessel Keter. When the fifth vessel Malchut emerges in the Partzuf, the light Ye- chida enters it. All the lights are now in their places, since the light Nefesh exits the vessel Tifferet, and descends to the vessel Malchut, while the light Ruach descends to the vessel Tifferet, the light Nesha- ma enters the vessel Bina, the light Haya enters the vessel Hochma, and the light Yechida enters the vessel Keter. When the Partzuf consisting of five parts of the “desire to receive” (the Kelim Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet and Malchut) is filled with the light, Nefesh is in Malchut, Ruach is in Tifferet, Neshama is in Bina, Haya is in Hochma and Yechida is in Keter. This is what a completely filled Partzuf looks like. However, the formation, i.e., correction of the Kelim, their acquir- ing the screen, occurs from the most unselfish ( Keter ) to the most egoistic ( Malchut ) from up downwards. Their filling with the lights starts from the weakest one ( Nefesh ) to the most intense pleasure ( Yechida ). Gradually, all the lights first enter Keter , one after the other . The filling of the Partzuf always occurs in the following order: Keter – Hochma – Bina – Tifferet – Malchut. The lights enter in the following order: Nefesh – Ruach – Neshama – Haya – Yechida. The rule states: the Kli starts grow-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 165 ing from the uppermost Sefira, while the lights enter from the lowest one. It is similar to two cylinders entering one another. According to the order of their entering the Partzuf from Nefesh to Yechida, the lights are abbreviated NaRaNHaY, from the smallest to the largest; while the Kelim are abbreviated according to their descending order KaHaB-TuM . We see the same occurrence in our life: if I want to resist some pleasure while remaining somehow connected to it, I always start from the smallest one, gradually passing to more and more intense delights, until I am quite sure that even the biggest pleasures I can receive are not for my own sake. When we say that a new Kli is born, it means that there is a screen for the corresponding pleasure, the force of resisting this delight, the intention to receive for the Creator’s sake. Consequently, the Partzuf is being filled with the light that matches the opposing force. The screen appears as a result of focused studies and work in a group with the proper intention. When a Kabbalist acquires a screen for the smallest desire, he only works with it. The rest of his desires are sim- ply put aside and restricted. Because of man's efforts, the screen grows stronger, i.e., an additional force of resisting a bigger desire emerges and man starts working with two desires and receives two lights. This continues until there is a screen for all five desires, when all the lights can be received for the sake of the Creator. Every time a man can work with new desires, the preceding ones come nearer to perfec- tion, for along with the light that was in it, a new more powerful light enters bringing greater pleasure. If a person, who consistently studies in a group of like-minded people and listens to the Teacher’s explanations, can afterwards con- centrate on the same spiritual matters, while being in various states and circumstances of our world, then the next time he comes to study he will feel more than the previous time. He will receive a higher light, for he"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 166 now works with purer Kelim and does not think about animal pleasures. This is what the inverse relationship between the Ohrot and the Kelim (the lights and the vessels) means. The land of Israel differs from all other places by its highest level of egoism. It is the most difficult place for the spiritual work. However, at the same time, it is unique and most favorable. This land has a special spiritual potential. The Baal HaSulam wrote that Jerusalem is a place of the destruction of the Temple. The most powerful force is present there, but so are the mightiest impure forces, the Klipot. Is the Kli Keter , the Aviut de Shoresh, designed for the smallest or the biggest pleasure? – It is meant for the biggest delight – the Ohr Ye- chida , which enters Keter last, when the Keter las t, when the Keter Masach gets strong enough to oppose the most intense desire of Malchut. In other words, by working with the lowest desires, creating for them the intention to receive pleasure for the Creator’s sake, the Kabbalist receives the greatest delight – the Ohr Yechida, which enters the purest Kli Keter . If, by filling his coarsest animal desires, man can think about the Creator and the Purpose of Creation, then while learning, studying Kab- balistic texts and also by praying, he will surely establish better contact with the Creator. There are five desires to receive pleasure in the Kli . Its “size” or “volume” depends only on the screen. The level of desire it can resist determines the light that will enter the Kli , i.e., the Kli ’s level. First, one works with the Kli of Aviut de Shoresh and gradually creates the screen for Aviut Aleph . When this process is over, you will be able to receive the same screen for Aviut Aleph and work with it. Next, little by little, you create a screen for Aviut Bet, Gimel, and Dalet. The Kli with the initial Aviut Shoresh must have rudiments of the screen for all the five Behinot, to build the screen for all these kinds of Aviut."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 167 The Kli gradually builds itself going from the tiniest desires to the biggest. It happens in this order to avoid the egoistic reception of pleasure. The desires are measured according to the intensity of the pleasure felt. That is how humankind progresses from small desires to bigger ones. Beginning to work with the smallest desire ( Keter ), man transforms it into an altruistic one with the help of the screen. Then he receives the light Nefesh , feeling great pleasure, because the Creator is partially re- vealed in it, i.e., according to the size of the Kli's correction, he becomes equal to the Creator. The Ohr Nefesh is a delight of being united with the Creator in the smallest, fifth part, where one is able to feel eternity, wisdom, absolute knowledge, exquisite delight and perfection. Such a state of the Kli means transcending the bounds of our world, our nature. So far, the Kli is unable to see beyond that state. Nev- ertheless, as it develops further, it starts feeling more and more perfect states, receiving greater and greater pleasures. Man’s reception of Ohr Nefesh means reception of all five parts of that light: Nefesh de Nefesh, Ruach de Nefesh, Neshama de Nefesh, Haya de Nefesh, and Yechida de Nefesh ( “de” means “of”) . Any Kli, any reception, also consists of five parts. It is similar to the way we receive information in this world through our five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. All these five lights must manifest in the Kli Keter , where the light Nefesh enters first. The same happens with the rest of the lights. All ex- ternal religious trappings just hint at spiritual actions. Great Kabbalists in each generation introduced certain rules into the life of the religious masses to bind them to the Torah and thus educate them. For example, there is the tradition of putting on two robes, which symbolizes the two types of “Levushim” (clothes) that dress the soul in the world of Atzilut. All these religious rituals have a Kabbalistic meaning."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 168 The principal spiritual law is the equivalence of man’s properties, his desires, with those of the Creator. The Creator’s light is homogeneous by nature. A certain Kli , de- pending on its inner parameters, distinguishes in the homogeneous light various “tastes”, i.e., different kinds of pleasure: the Ohr Yashar, the Ohr Hozer, the Ohr Elion, the Ohr Pnimi, the Ohr Makif, etc. This is the same light; everything depends on how the Kli perceives it. Prior to entering the Kli, it is called the simple Upper Light (the Ohr Elion Mufshat ), since no diversity of properties can be distinguished in it. This resembles the Baal HaSulam’s example about the heavenly manna, which has no taste, whereas everyone senses the taste that cor- responds to his properties. If the simple Upper Light shines in the head of the Partzuf , it is called Partzuf , it is called Partzuf “ the Ohr Yashar” (the Direct Light). The light reflected by the screen ( the Ohr Hozer) envelops the Ohr Yashar, and when they both enter the Kli, this light receives another name – the Ohr Pnimi (the Inner Light) or Ta’amim (tastes). Since the Partzuf receives only a certain portion of the coming Partzuf r eceiv es only a cer t ain por tion of the coming Partzuf light, the uncollected part of it is left outside of the Kli. This part of the light is called “ the Ohr Makif” (the Surrounding Light). The Partzuf will gradually receive this light in small portions. The state in which the entire Surrounding Light will be able to enter the Partzuf is called Gmar Tikkun (the Final Correction). The light exiting the Kli is called “Nekudot” – points, because Mal- chut is called a point, a black point, due to its egoistic properties, which are unable to receive the light after TA. Upon filling the Partzuf with the Inner Light, the Surrounding Light presses on the screen in the Tabur, so that the Kli might receive the light left outside. However, the Partzuf does not have the proper Masach for this light. Hence, if it receives it (it already lacks the intention for the Creator’s sake), such a reception will be egoistic. Since the restriction on receiving"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 169 the light is a consequence of Malchut’s egoistic desire (the black point), the light exiting Malchut is called “Nekudot”. When the Inner Light exits the Partzuf and shines on it from afar, Partzuf and shines on it fr om af ar , Partzuf it provokes a special sensation, an impression inside the Kli, called recol- lections ( Reshimot ). These recollections constitute the vital information without which the Partzuf cannot know what to do next. שלא האורות נמצאים , בפרצוף מ \" תו ב \" כח הכלים ' ה כל נגדלו שלא עוד שכל הרי ( כה אור שם חסר מלכות כלי שבחוסר , ההפכי בערך שהם אלא , עוד ולא . להם המיוחס במקומם נגדלים שבכלים מטעם שהוא .' וכו , חיה יחידה שם חסרים מ \" תו הכלים ' ב ובחוסר , היחידה . תחילה האחרונים נכנסים ובהאורות , תחילה העליונים המקבל שכל , מטעם והוא . דכתר בכלי רק מתלבש הוא , מחדש הבא אור שכל , תמצא גם שכבר , האורות מחויבים זה ומטעם . דכתר הכלי שהוא , שבו זך היותר בהכלי לקבל מחויב אור בביאת למשל . חדש אור כל ביאת בעת , ממקומם אחת מדרגה לרדת , בפרצוף מלובשים שיוכל , דכתר הכלי מקום לפנות כדי , דחכמה לכלי דכתר מהכלי לירד הנפש אור מחויב , הרוח . הרוח שהוא , החדש האור את לקבל לפנות , דחכמה לכלי דכתר מהכלי לרדת הרוח גם מחויב , נשמה הוא החדש האור אם וכן לרדת , דחכמה בכלי שהיה , הנפש מחויב זה ומשום . נשמה שהוא החדש לאור דכתר מקומו . החדש אור בשביל דכתר הכלי לפנות כדי הוא זה וכל . ז \" עד ' וכו . דבינה לכלי בערך ואם כלים בערך מדברים אם , ענין בכל תמיד להבחין ותוכל . בידך הזה הכלל ושמור בחינות ' ה ענין היטב נתבאר והנה . ביניהם הפכי ערך תמיד יש כי , תתבלבל לא ואז . אורות . מזה למטה זה הקומה שיעורי משתנים ידיהן שעל איך , שבמסך 25) Until the formation of all the five Kelim in the Partzuf has been completed, their five lights are not in their places; moreover, they are arranged in an inverse order. In the absence of the Kli Malchut, the light Yechida is missing in the Partzuf. In the absence of the two ves- sels Malchut and Tifferet, there are no lights Yechida and Haya. On the one hand, the pure vessels are born, from Keter to Malchut; on the other hand, the weaker lights (starting from Nefesh) are the first to enter them. Since any reception of the light occurs in the purest vessels, each new light must enter the Kli Keter. As the new light enters the Kli Keter, the light that was there descends to the Kli Hochma. When there is"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 170 a Masach for the vessel Hochma, Ohr Ruach enters the Kli Keter and the Ohr Nefesh descends to Hochma. As the screen grows stronger, the following vessels are formed: Bina, Tifferet and Malchut, and the lights Neshama, Haya, and Yechida are able, one by one, to pass through Keter and fill all the vessels. All the lights enter their rightful places: Nefesh in Malchut, Ruach in Tifferet, Neshama in Bina, Haya in Hochma and Yechida in Keter. Remember this rule about the inverse relationship between the lights and vessels, and you will always be able to distinguish whether the lights or the vessels are meant in a certain context without getting confused. We have learned about the five Behinot (levels) of the screen and how the levels of the Kli emerge one under the other in correspondence with them. Each new light is billions of times more intense than the preced- ing one. Hence, each subsequent level is perceived as a totally different world. In our world, where we have no screen at all, we cannot see the light that is before us. One can only see with the help of the Reflected Light (the Ohr Hozer) and only to the extent of Malchut's reflecting it . However, by studying Kabbalah we stimulate the Ohr Makif until Ohr Makif until Ohr Makif it creates in us the primary Kli Keter, where we will instantly receive the Ohr Nefesh. This state signifies our spiritual birth, crossing the barrier (the Machsom ) between our world and the spiritual one. It means we are on the lowest level of the world of Assiya. By continuing to work on our correction, we acquire the next screen of the Aviut Aleph and receive the light Aviut Aleph a n d r e c e i v e t h e l i g h t Aviut Aleph Ruach. Next, we acquire the screens for the Kelim Bet, Gimel, and Dalet and accordingly receive the lights Ne- shama, Haya, and Yechida. Now all the lights are in their correct places. How can we set up a screen? If I could know and feel my egoistic properties today, I would run away from the corrections! There is noth- ing my egoism hates more than the screen. Nevertheless, I cannot escape the spiritual for the reason that I am unaware of my own egoism or"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 171 do not understand my properties. Such an “unconscious” initial state is deliberately created that we may not resent spirituality, but that we may aspire to it out of a curiosity and desire to improve our future. Therefore, the principle consists in crossing the barrier in spite of our own nature. It happens unconsciously; man does not know what he is heading for or when it might happen. After crossing the Machsom, man begins to see that, until that moment, he was in a dream-like state. Two processes precede the crossing of the Machsom, the first be- ing a comprehension of one’s own evil. Man begins to understand how harmful his egoism is for him. The second process consists in the realiza- tion that spirituality is very attractive, and there is nothing more worth- while, magnificent, or eternal than that. These two opposite points (realization of the evil and attraction of the spiritual) come together in the common person to create a zero level. As they advance spiritually, they begin to move away from one another. At the same time, spirituality gets elevated in man’s eyes, while his ego- ism is perceived as evil. This difference between them, one’s own appraisal of the spiritual and criticism of egoism, increase so tremendously that it evokes one’s inner outcry, a request about a solution to the problem. If this outcry reaches the required intensity, the screen is given to one from above. The study of egoism, its correction and proper use, constitutes man’s entire journey from the initial state to the ultimate end (the Gmar Tikkun ). In the spiritual worlds, man continues to study his egoism on each level. The higher we ascend, the more egoism is added to us, so that by working with it, we are able to turn it into altruism. Everything we say is seen from the point of view of the creation. We cannot say anything about the Creator, since we do not really know who He is. On a personal level, I just know how He is perceived in my sensa- tions. Only philosophers have the time to speculate about something that can never be attained. Hence, this science has completely degenerated."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 172 Kabbalah operates only with what the Kabbalists sensed and quite distinctly drew upon themselves and related to us in a special Kabbalistic language. Everyone can reproduce that process internally as in a strict scientific experiment. The instrument of such an experiment is the screen that man must create in the central point of his own egoism; this “I” develops with the help of the method called Kabbalah. There are two kinds of screen. The first is positioned in front of the Kli in the Peh de Partzuf, i.e., in Malchut de Rosh. It reflects the entire light, as if standing guard over the implementation of TA. The second screen receives the light; it works with the Aviut that is positioned in Malchut de Guf. It absorbs all the egoism that can be transformed into reception for the sake of the Creator. Generally, the screen is always in Malchut , the lowest point of the Partzuf. Reflection and reception are two of its actions. The first forms Rosh while the second forms the Guf of the Partzuf. For further details, see Part 3 ( “Histaklut Pnimit” ), chapter 14, p. 5 of “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 173 T H E F I V E PA R T Z U F I M O F T H E W O R L D A D A M K A D M O N ק \" א פרצופי ' ה , שנצטמצמה אחר ד \" הבחי שהיא , המלכות בכלי שנתקן המסך ענין היטב שנתבאר אחר ( כו ' ה עתה נבאר , מזו למטה זו ס \" ע של קומות ' ה המוציאים , בו אשר דהכאה זווג מיני ' ה וענין . ע \" אבי עולמות ' לד הקודמים , ק \" א פרצופי דאור ס \" הע ומלביש למעלה ממטה דהכאה זווג י \" ע שעולה , הזה ח \" שהאו , ידעת כבר וזאת , הכלים את לגמור ובכדי .\" הפרצוף דראש ס \" ע \" המכונים , כלים לשרשי רק מספיק הוא , העליון . דראש ס \" לע שהלבישו ח \" דאו ס \" הע מאותם דראש המלכות מתרחבת . דראש ספירות שבעשר קומה שיעור באותו , למטה ממעלה ובה מינה מתפשטת והיא יש ס \" ע של בחינות ' שב באופן .\" הפרצוף גוף \" נקראים שהם , הכלים נגמרו הזה ובהתפשטות . וגוף ראש : פרצוף בכל תמיד להבחין 26) We clearly understand the notion of the Masach (screen), placed over the Kli Malchut (Behina Dalet) after TA, and also the five kinds of Zivugeyde Haka’athat occur on this screen to create five levels of 10 Sefirot, one beneath the other. Now we shall learn about the five Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon (AK) that precedes the four worlds of ABYA. We know that the Ohr Hozer that rises as a result of the Zivug de Haka’a dresses the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light; this is sufficient only to create “the roots” of the future Kelim defined as the 10 Se- firot de Rosh . Malchut spreads from up downwards, according to the height of the level of the 10 Sefirot de Rosh. It results in the creation of the Kelim called “Guf”(body) of the Partzuf (see §14). Therefore, there are always two kinds of the 10 Sefirot in the Partzuf: the Rosh and the Guf. In each Partzuf, two kinds of the 10 Sefirot should be determined: the Rosh and the Guf. Those who do not know Hebrew find it much easier to study Kabbalah, because they do not take literally such Kabbal- istic terms as Peh -mouth, Rosh -head, Guf -body, Guf -body , Guf Tabur -navel etc. They can Tabur -na v el e tc. The y can Tabur"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 174 understand them abstractedly, and such people do not make a material- istic picture out of these terms. These students easily perceive all the above-mentioned terms as forc- es, desires, intentions, not as body parts. There are no bodies in the spiri- tual world, only the desire to receive pleasure, the intention for the sake of what or whom one can receive this pleasure, and the pleasure itself. The place where the reflecting Masach resides is called the Peh . At first, the Masach pushes away all the Ohr Yashar that is before it, as if to say it does not want to receive anything for its own sake. Then a calculation is made in the Rosh to determine how much can be received anyway, not for its own sake, but for the sake of the Creator. Then, the Ohr Hozer dresses the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light (de Ohr Elion) from down upwards. It is sufficient only for making a clear decision; the vessel roots (Shor- shey Kelim) . The 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light that dress the 10 Sefirot o f t h e R e f l e c t e d L i g h t t h a t d r e s s t h e 1 0 Sefirot Sefirot of Sefirot o f Sefirot the Direct Light together form the 10 Sefirot of the Sefirot o f t h e Sefirot Rosh of the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf To complete the formation of the Kelim and truly receive the light, the 10 Sefirot de Ohr Yashar dress into the 10 Sefirot de Ohr Hozer. They “pass” through the Masach , spread from up downwards, thus widening the tenth Sefira of the Rosh - Malchut de Rosh for its own 10 Sefirot - from Keter to Keter t o Keter Hochma and forming the Kelim de Guf . Before Malchut could receive for the sake of the Creator, it was compressed, restricted to the size of a point. Nevertheless, by receiving the screen, it acquired a new intention to receive for the sake of the Cre- ator, and then it “expanded” from a point to the 10 Sefirot , receiving the light into the Guf .

The Upper Light descended to be dressed in the Kli Malchut accord- ing to its nature. However, the screen, which positioned itself before Malchut, reflected and returned it to the Source. Because of this Stroke Contact, the Ohr Hozer ascended to the level of Keter de Ohr Elion. This Ohr Hozer has become the embryo of the vessels (“the Shorshey Kelim”) for the 10 Sefirot de Rosh of the first Partzuf of Adam Kadmon. Afterwards, by using the power of the 10 Sefirot de Rosh, Malchut de Rosh together with Ohr Hozer expanded and spread from up down- wards, thus creating inside itself 10 new Sefirot, which are true and complete Kelim. All that potentially existed in the Rosh has finally manifested and taken form in the Guf. Thus, the creation of the Rosh and the Guf of the first Partzuf of the world Adam Kadmon was completed. After TA , when Malchut made a restriction on reception of the light, it decided to receive a portion of it with the help of the screen for the sake of the Creator. The first reception formed the first Partzuf of the Partzuf of the Partzuf world of Adam Kadmon ( Keter or Keter or Keter Galgalta ). Overall, there are five Partzu- fim in the world of Adam Kadmon . The Masach in the Kli Malchut pushed away the entire Upper Light.

Guf The part of the Kli ( Guf ), which was filled with the light, is called Guf ), whic h w as f illed with the light, is called Guf the Toch (the inner part), and the light in it is called “ the Ohr Pnimi” – the Inner Light. The part of the Guf that remained empty is called the Guf that r emained em p ty is called the Guf Sof (end), and the light in it is called the Ohr Hassadim. This part refuses to receive any pleasure, because it does not have a proper screen; so if it receives the light, this will lead to the reception of pleasure for its own sake. The boundary separating the Toch and the Sof is called the Tabur (navel). The light that has not entered the Tabur (na v el). The light that has no t ent er ed the Tabur Kli is called the Ohr Makif (the Surrounding Light). Ohr Makif (the Surr ounding Light). Ohr Makif Each Partzuf sees what light is in front of it only with the help of the Reflected Light. If the power of the Reflected Light equals the power of the screen on all five Behinot, it can see the light of Keter. It divides this light into five parts, fills the Toch with them, leaving the Sof empty. Sof em p ty . Sof Light of any intensity can shine in the Rosh of Partzuf, but Malchut de Peh de Rosh will see only as much as the Ohr Hozer allows it to. Our senses are based on the same principle. Make them more sen- sitive and they will see micron-sized objects, feel microbes etc. In other words, everything depends not on what really surrounds us, but on what- ever we are able to detect, on the perceptibility of our sensors. Each subsequent Partzuf has a screen of a smaller quantity and quality of desires ( Behinot ) than the preceding one; therefore, its Ohr Hozer is smaller and it sees the light of a lower level. It resembles a person whose eyesight has deteriorated and who can see objects only at a short distance."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 177 If the screen has the strength of the Behina Gimel, it can see the light of the level of Hochma as regards the preceding Partzuf. Regarding itself, it receives the same five parts of the light of NaRaNHaY, but of the general level of Hochma, not Keter. Let us take the example of this world: a tall person and a short one naturally consist of the same “parts”. How- ever, we say that one of them is a whole head taller than the other, i.e., the latter is, as it were, short by a head. We study the descending worlds. When the Universe came into being, the Partzuf Adam HaRishon (the First Man) was created. Then this Partzuf split into 600,000 fragments called souls. Each of these fragments has to receive its part of the Upper Light. When the soul, i.e., a fragment of the Partzuf Adam HaRishon, reaches a certain level in the spiritual world, it receives a little of its part of the light. Although it has not yet received the entire light assigned to it, the soul perceives this state as absolutely perfect. Then a little more egoism is added to it (the soul) and again it begins to wish for more. By correcting this portion of egoism, it receives a new portion of the light in the newly corrected vessels, and only then realizes that there is a greater perfection to be attained. If a man lacks this inner desire, the need or point in his heart, he is unable to understand how one can be interested in spirituality. By the way, fortune telling, amulets, alternative medicine and blessings have nothing to do with spirituality. Kabbalah interprets the spiritual as the aspiration for the Creator, His properties. In fact, we always discover that whatever seemed supernatural to us turns out to be the work of more or less talented frauds who use the forces of our world unknown to most people, as well as psychology and the inner powers of the human body."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 178 עביות רק בו שאין , מלכות שבכלי המתוקן מסך על דהכאה הזווג אותו ונשנה חזר ז \" ואח ( כח , ד \" דבחי העביות במסך שחסר מתוך כי . וגוף ראש . חכמה קומת רק עליו יצא ואז . ג \" דבחי , נ \" חנר שהם , לבד אורות ' ד רק להלביש ח \" באו מקום אין כ \" וע . ת \" ת ב \" כח כלים ' ד רק בו אין .\" ק \" דא ב \" ע \" ונקרא . היחידה אור בו וחסר ואז . ב \" דבחי עביות רק בו שאין , מלכות שבכלי מסך על ל \" הנ דהכאה הזווג אותו חזר כ \" ואח הכלים ' ב בו שחסרים ,\" ק \" דא ג \" ס \" פרצוף נקרא והוא . בינה בקומת וגוף ראש ס \" ע עליו יצאו . יחידה דחיה האורות ' וב ומלכות א \" דז בקומת וגוף ראש ס \" ע יצאו ואז . א \" דבחי עביות רק בו שאין מסך על דהכאה הזווג יצא כ \" ואח רוח אלא בו ואין , יחידה חיה נשמה אורות ' וג , ומלכות א \" ז בינה כלים ' ג בו וחסרים . ת \" ת וזכור . ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ פרצוף הנקרא והוא . דכלים חכמה בכתר המלובשים , מהאורות ונפש .( ד \" כ באות ל \" כנ ) לאורות כלים שבין ההפכי ערך את כאן 28) After the above, there was one more Stroke Contact with the screen of the Kli Malchut. However, this time the Behina Dalet was absent in it. The screen now has only four vessels: Keter, Hochma, Bina, and Tifferet. Therefore, the next Partzuf of the world of Adam Kadmon, which emerged one level below the Partzuf Galgalta, on the level of Hochma, is called AB. In this case, the Ohr Hozer dresses onto the four lights of the NaRaNH while the fifth part, the Ohr Yechida, is absent. The Behinot Dalet and Gimel are absent in the screen of the third Partzuf. Hence, it emerged one level lower than the Partzuf AB, i.e., on the level of Bina, and the lights Yechida and Haya are absent in it. It is two steps lower than the first Partzuf and only one step lower than the second. It is called Bina or SAG. Then a Zivug de Haka’a occurred on the Masach with the Masach w i t h t h e Masach Aviut Aleph; thus, the Rosh and the Rosh a n d t h e Rosh Guf emerged on the level of Guf e m e r g e d o n t h e l e v e l o f Guf Tifferet with the lights Tifferet w i t h t h e l i g h t s Tifferet Nefesh and Nefesh a n d Nefesh Ruach , whereas the lights Neshama, Haya, and Yechida are ab- sent. There are no Kelim Dalet, Gimel, and Bet ; therefore, the corresponding lights are also missing. This Partzuf is called Tifferet or Tifferet o r Tifferet MA . The final fifth Partzuf emerged on the Partzuf emer ged on the Partzuf Aviut Shoresh with the light Nefesh . It is called Malchut or BON ."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 179 זה , ן \" וב ה \" מ ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא הנקראים , ק \" א פ \" ה של יציאתם אופן נתבארו והנה ( כט . יחידה אור חסר ב \" ע לפרצוף כי . שלו העליון של עליונה בחינה חסר תחתון שכל , מזה למטה גם חסר ן \" וב ה \" מ ובפרצוף . ב \" ע שהוא , שלו להעליון שיש , החיה אור גם חסר ג \" ס ובפרצוף , שבהמסך העוביות בשיעור תלוי שזה מטעם והוא . ג \" ס שהוא , שלו בהעליון שיש , הנשמה אור , ויתמעט ילך שהמסך גרם ומה מי : להבין צריכים אמנם .( ח \" י אות ) . דהכאה הזווג נעשה שעליו ? הללו זווגים מיני ' שבה קומה שיעורי ' לה שיתחלק עד , עוביותו משיעור בחינה אחר בחינה 29) So we have investigated the formation of the five Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon called Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA and BON, where each subsequent Partzuf is one step lower than the preceding one. For example, there is no light of Yechida in the Partzuf AB, and no light of Haya in SAG (it was in AB). The light of Neshama is absent in the Partzuf MA. The level of each Partzuf depends on the thickness of the screen on which a Zivug de Haka’a is made (see §18). However, we have not yet clarified the reason for the lessening of the screen’s thickness at the formation of a new Partzuf. After TA Malchut acquires a screen with five degrees of hardness, hence it can work with all five levels of its desires. Using the screen’s force, it reflects the entire light and in the Reflected Light reaches the level of Keter. It “sees” all five parts of the coming light: the lights in the Sefirot Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, and Malchut, which are in the Rosh. Approximately 20% of each light can be received in the Toch. The general level of this light is determined according to the high- est light – Yechida, which corresponds to the level of Keter (Komat Keter). In the second Partzuf, Malchut can receive less light, since it loses one higher level of desire – the Aviut Dalet and the light Yechida. The amount of light in the third, fourth and fifth Partzufim is even smaller.Their level gets lower and lower because of the decreasing Aviut that occurs from Gimel to Bet in the third Partzuf, from Bet to Aleph in the fourth and from Aleph to Shoresh in the fifth. According to the degree"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 180 of Aviut, there are no lights Yechida and Haya in the third Partzuf SAG , Yechida, Haya and Neshama – in the fourth and Yechida, Haya, Neshama and Ruach – in the fifth . The Partzufim look this way only as regards one another, where each Partzuf that follows is “one head” lower than the preceding one by the level of the light, strength, and quality. However, each of them has its own 5 (or 10, for Sefira Tifferet consists of 6 Sefirot consists of 6 Sef ir o t consists of ) Sefirot KaHaB-TuM and 5 lights NaRaNHaY, respectively . Each Partzuf must have a set of all those 10 parts of which the cre- ation consists. The Partzufim differ only by the strength of their screen. Therefore, when the screen grows weaker, a new Partzuf is born one-step lower than the preceding one. After TA, the Kli consists of the “desire to receive” and the Masach . The filling of the Kli happens in accordance with the strength and size of this Masach. The screen can push away the pleasures corresponding to its five, four, three, two, or one desires. Every Partzuf consists of five parts, defined as: Keter The point of beginning the letter Yud Hochma Yud Bina Hey Tifferet Vav Malchut Hey These letters are the shell of the Partzuf, the five permanent parts that constitute its Kli. According to the strength of the screen, the Partzuf fills these parts with more or less intensive light – the Ohr Hochma or the Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma is denoted by the letter Yud and the Ohr Hassadim – by the letter Hey. Therefore, we can designate each Partzuf by a letter code or a number."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 181 As it was explained in the article “The Letters of Amnon-Saba” (p.104): “Each Partzuf consists of five parts = 5 Partzuf c o n s i s t s o f f i v e p a r t s = 5 Partzuf Sefirot: a point and 4 letters: Keter- point +Hochma-Yud+Bina-Hey+ZA-Vav+Malchut-Hey=HaVaYaH ”. The differ- ence between all 125 Partzufim is in the light that fills them, while the shell HaVaYaH remains the same. This is because the desire cannot be formed unless the Creator’s light goes through five preliminary stages, where only the fifth stage constitutes the birth of the new creation – a new desire. The entire Universe and all the worlds are only the 10 Sefirot, or the Creator’s name HaVaYaH: Sefira Letter Partzuf World Light Keter Hochma Bina ZA Malchut Point Yud Hey Vav Hey Galgalta AB SAG MA BON AK Atzilut Beria Yetzira Assiya Yechida Haya Neshama Ruach Nefesh The filling of HaVaYaH with the light is called its revelation, for it is to that degree that the Creator reveals Himself in this desire. By this ac- tion, the letters emerge out of the state of concealment and emptiness. Overall, there are five Partzufim: Keter (Galgalta), AB, SAG, MA, BON. Keter is the principal BON. Keter is the principal BON. Keter Partzuf , the source of the rest of them. Within Partzuf , the sour ce of the r es t of them. Within Partzuf Keter’s 10 Sefirot is a simple or inner HaVaYaH. Moreover, each of the four letters of its HaVaYaH gets outside and creates a new Partzuf that dresses onto the Partzuf Galgalta. So, the following Partzufim emerge from Keter-Galgalta: Yud Partzuf Hochma, AB Hey Partzuf Bina, SAG Vav Partzuf ZA, MA Hey Partzuf Malchut, BON Thus, the Partzuf Keter is denoted by a simple HaVaYaH, while the Partzufim that dress onto it are denoted by a HaVaYaH with fillings. The"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 182 registration of HaVaYaH with the light that fills it is called “ Milluy ” (fill- ing). For a short designation of the Partzuf, the notion Gematria (numeri- cal value of the fillings) was introduced. The letters of the alphabet: Name Pronunciation Gematria Aleph Bet Gimel Dalet Hey Vav Zayn Het Tet Yud Chaf Lamed Mem Nun Samech Ayn Pey Tzady Kuf Reish Shin Tav [a], [e] b, v g (gate) d [a], [e] v, [u], [o] z h (how) t y, i (in) h, k l m n s [a], [e] p tz k r sh, s t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 The Gematria of the Partzuf that is not filled with the light, i.e., the Ge- matria of the empty HaVaYaH is equal to Yud+Hey+Vav+Hey =10+5+6+5=26. The filling of each letter forms the Gematria of the filled HaVaYaH : each Hebrew letter has a full name: A – Aleph, B – Bet and so on, according to the table."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 183 Hence, there are 4 kinds of fillings of HaVaYaH : a) AB; b) SAG; c) MA; d) BON. a) HaVaYaH with the filling of AB : - Yud : Yud+Vav+Dalet= 10+6+4=20 - Hey : Hey+Yud =5+10=15 - Vav : Vav+Yud+Vav= 6+10+6=22 - Hey : Hey+Yud =5+10=15 Total: 72=20+15+22+15= AB, where the letter A stands not for Aleph= 1 , but for Ayn= 70 (they are just pronounced the same way, there- fore in English they are marked by the same letter). HaVaYaH , filled with such light, is called the Partzuf AB, the Partzuf Hochma, because the letter Yud in its filling means the Ohr Hochma. Such filling of HaVaYaH is called HaVaYaH with the filling of Yud. b) HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG . The Partzuf , filled with the Partzuf , f illed with the Partzuf light of Hassadim , is called SAG, because such is its Gematria: SAG = Samech (60) + Gimel (3) = 63: - Yud : Yud+Vav+Dalet= 10+6+4=20 - Hey : Hey+Yud =5+10=15 - Vav : Vav+Aleph+Vav= 6+1+6=13 - Hey : Hey+Yud =5+10=15 Total: 63= 60+3= Samech + Gimel = SAG . If the Kelim and their filling originate in the Tzimtzum Aleph (TA) , then there is Yud in the filling of the HaVaYaH . We will learn that later there was another restric- tion Tzimtzum Bet (TB) . Therefore, if the Kelim are filled with the light from the Second Restriction, then in their filling of HaVaYaH the letter Aleph is present instead of Yud is present instead of Y ud is present instead of . The difference between AB and SAG is in the filling of the letter Vav : in AB the Gematria of Vav= 22 from the filling with the light of Ho- 22 from the filling with the light of Ho- 22 from the filling with the light of chma, and in SAG the Gematria of the letter Vav =13, from filling with the light of Hassadim. From the above statement, it is clear that AB originates in TA and in the Partzuf SAG its letter Vav , or ZA , derives from TB ."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 184 c) HaVaYaH with the filling of MA : - Yud : Yud+Vav+Dalet = 20 - Hey : Hey+Aleph = 6 - Vav : Vav-Aleph-Vav = 13 - Hey : Hey+Aleph = 6 Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called: 20+6+13+6=45=40+5= Mem + Hey = MA . The letter Hey is pronounced as [a]. d) HaVaYaH with the filling of BON : - Yud : Yud+Vav+Dalet = 20 - Hey : Hey+ Hey = 10 - Vav : Vav+ Vav = 12 - Hey : Hey+ Hey = 10 Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20+10+12+10 = 52 = 50+2 = Nun + Bet , and is pronounced in the reversed order: BON . Malchut of the World of Infinity is a simple “desire to receive”. The screen, by way of dividing Malchut into different parts, calls forth the variety of its forms: - The division of Malchut into five general parts is called “worlds”. - The division of each world into five more parts is called “Partzufim”. - The division of each Partzuf into five more parts is called “ Sefirot”. Each Sefira in turn consists of five more sub- Sefirot , which in turn consists of its own 10 Sefirot, and so on ad infinitum. Our world is a reflection of the lowest spiritual world, and it has the same types and kinds of objects as in the spiritual world, except they are, as it were, made of a different substance. They consist of a material desire to receive pleasure without the screen, from the portion of light, completely detached from the Creator. We feel it as pleasure, but we do not feel its source. Therefore, by studying the spiritual world, one can completely attain the entire nature of our world, all its laws."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 185 T H E W E A K E N I N G O F T H E M A S A C H F O R T H E C R E A T I O N O F T H E PA R T Z U F פרצוף לאצילות המסך הזדככות ' בה שנתבאר , מזה למטה זה קומה שיעורי ' בה המדרגות השתלשלות ענין להבין בכדי ( ל העולמות ' מד ועולם עולם כל של פ \" בה המתבארים המדרגות בכל וכן , לעיל ק \" דא פרצופין פרצוף בכל הנוהג , דגוף המסך הזדככות ענין היטב להבין צריכים , דעשיה המלכות עד ע \" אבי . התיקון ובעולם הנקודים ועולם ק \" א מפרצופי 30) In order to understand the development of the spiritual levels, expressed by the five degressive Partzufim of the world AK, and all levels of the five Partzufim of each of the four worlds of ABYA, down to Malchut of the world of Assiya, we have to learn properly what the thinning of Masach de Guf is. This occurs in all the Partzufim of the worlds AK, Nikudim and Atzilut (the world of Correction). All the levels, beginning with the World of Infinity (the Olam Ein Sof ) and down to our world, are created according to one and the same Sof ) and do wn t o our w orld, ar e cr eat ed accor ding t o one and the same Sof scheme. The more removed a level is from the World of Infinity, the thinner and weaker the screen becomes. Because of this, Malchut receives less and less light each time its levels descend lower and lower, until gradually Malchut descends from its highest state – the Olam Ein Sof and Sof and Sof reaches its lowest state - our world. הנקראים , אורות ' ב לה יהיה שלא , שהיא מדרגה איזה או פרצוף לך שאין , הוא והענין ( לא , ה \" ב ס \" א אור ס \" ה ק \" דא ' הא פרצוף של מקיף האור כי . ק \" בא ונבארם . פנימי ואור מקיף אור דהכאה זווג נעשה , במלכות שנתקן והמסך ' א הצמצום לאחר אשר . המציאות כל את הממלא . הזה המסך על ס \" הא מאור דראש ס \" ע בבחינת , הצמצום לעולם העליון אור והמשיך חזר , המסך שהעלה ח \" האו י \" וע .( ה \" כ אות ) דגוף ס \" וע , הצמצום כמטרם המציאות כל את ממלאת אינה ה \" ב ס \" מא ק \" א שבפרצוף זו המשכה אמנם , ז \" דעוה הנקודה על נפסק אורו כי , למטה מלמעלה מבחינת הן : וסוף בראש שנבחן אלא .\" הזיתים הר על רגליו ועמדו \" ה \" בסו המסיימת מלכות ס \" שה את מסיימה והמלכות מ \" תו ב \" כח למטה ממעלה ס \" ע שיש כמו כי . לחוץ מבפנים מבחינת הן , ועור בשר גידין עצמות מוחא המכונים , לחוץ מפנים מ \" תו ב \" כח ס \" ע יש כן , מלמטה ק \" הא . מבחוץ הפרצוף את מסיימת , המלכות סוד שהוא , העור אשר"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 186 דק קו כמו רק , המציאות כל את הממלא ה \" ב ס \" א כלפי , ק \" א פרצוף נבחן הזה בערך אשר להתרחב יכול ואינו , מבחוץ סביב סביב אותו ומגבילה אותו מסיימת העור פרצוף כי . בלבד . החלל של באמצעו עומד דק קו רק ונשאר . שנצטמצם החלל כל את למלא , הזה הגדול ההפרש וכל .\" פנימי אור \" נקרא , הדק קו דהיינו , ק \" בא שנתקבל האור שיעור והנה נשאר הוא כי .\" מקיף אור \" נקרא , הצמצום שמטרם ה \" ב ס \" א אור ובין ק \" שבא פ \" האו שבין . הפרצוף בפנימיות להתלבש יכול לא כי , ק \" א פרצוף מסביב מ \" או בבחינת 31) The fact is that any Partzuf, or even any spiritual level, has two kinds of the light: the Ohr Makif (the Surrounding Light) and the Ohr Pnimi (the Inner Light). As was made clear, in the first Partzuf of the world AK Galgalta the Surrounding Light is the light of the World of Infinity, which fills the entire Universe. After TA and emerg- ing of Masach, the Stroke Contact (the Zivug de Haka’a) between the entire light of the World of Infinity with this Masach takes place. The Ohr Hozer that emerged as a result of this Zivug allowed a part of the Upper Light to enter the world of Restriction (the Olam HaTzimtzum) and thus created the ten Sefirot de Rosh and the ten Sefirot de Guf, as was said in § 25. However, the entire light did not enter the Partzuf Galgalta. Now the light of the World of Infinity does not fill the entire Universe, as was the case before TA. Now there are Rosh and Sof, i.e., while the ten Sefirot spread downwards, the light stops at the point of “this world”, in “limiting” Malchut (Malchut Masayemet), as said: “his feet are standing on the Mount of Olives”... Furthermore, now there is a notion “from inside out”. Similarly to the downward spreading of the ten Sefirot Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet, Malchut (KaHaB-TuM) and limiting Malchut, there also exists the spreading of the ten Sefirot KaHaB-TuM from inside out. Here the Sefirot are called: Mocha-brain (Keter), Atzamot-bones (Hochma), Gidin-tendons (Bina), Basar-flesh (Tifferet), and Or-skin (Malchut; “Or” with the letter “Ayn”, not with “Aleph”, i.e., “the light”). Concerning the World of Infinity, where the entire Universe"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 187 was filled with the light of the Partzuf Galgalta, there is just a thin ray of light. Or-skin (Malchut) limits the Partzuf on the outside, prevent- ing the light from “widening” further and filling the empty space. The amount of light (its thin ray) received in Galgalta is called “the Ohr Pnimi” (the Inner Light). The enormous amount of light of the World of Infinity, which did not enter Galgalta, remained outside. Now this light is called the Ohr Makif (the Surrounding Light). It cannot enter the Partzuf but rather surrounds it on all sides. Any part of Malchut is called a level, if it has filled each of its desires with the light by using a screen. Each level received by Malchut divides the coming light into two parts: the Ohr Pnimi , which enters the Partzuf, and the Ohr Makif . Makif . Makif The screen sees the entire light coming to it with the help of the Ohr Hozer , and then determines how much it can receive with the help of the screen for the sake of the Creator, and how much it must leave outside. The screen always divides the light into two parts. The Ohr Pnimi (the received part) is only a thin ray of light, which entered Malchut , i.e., the empty space, departed after TA (before TA Mal- chut was completely filled). We see the strength of egoism, which allowed just a thin ray of light to enter Malchut with the help of the screen. More- over, it only refers to the first Partzuf of AK - Galgalta . The remaining Partzufim are filled with even less light. Then, with the help of this ray of light, additional Partzufim are created. In the very center of this dark sphere – Malchut, after TA, there is our world. In the world of Atzilut a very special Partzuf, Adam HaRishon, is born. It consists of two components: the qualities of Bina and Malchut . Then this Partzuf splits into numerous separate Partzufim , called “souls”. By acquiring the screen, the formed souls can gradually fill the en- tire sphere with the light. Such a state is called “The Final Correction” of the souls with the help of the screen -“ the Gmar Tikkun” . After that, the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 188 further widening of Malchut consists in the attainment of the Creator, not inside itself, but above its properties. This already refers to that part of Kabbalah called “the secrets of the Torah”. The rest of Kabbalah, everything that is below this level and refers to “Ta’amey Torah” , can and must be studied by all. Kabbalists must open “Ta’amey Torah” to everyone but conceal “the secrets of the Torah”. There are many kinds of the Ohr Makif as well as the Ohr Pnimi . One of them shines upon man when he has no screen yet, no corrected feeling - and man starts longing for the spiritual. It happens owing to the Ohr Makif that shines upon him. Here the light is primary and the desire Ohr Makif that shines upon him. Her e the light is primar y and the desir e Ohr Makif is secondary. The Ohr Makif starts shining when man does not yet understand where this luminescence comes from, but spirituality begins to attract him. As he starts learning, he arouses upon himself the luminescence of another kind, which gradually corrects him; with its help, man begins to see his shortcomings, more and more opening the surrounding world. Gradually the light creates the spiritual picture before him, which gets clearer and clearer, as if emerging out of a fog. We are surrounded by the Creator, Who is behind all objects around us, and wishes to bring us nearer to Him. For this purpose, He uses the objects of nature. In our world, He does it with the help of people - family, boss, acquaintances. He deliberately sends us compli- cated situations and sufferings, so that by trying to escape from them, we would come closer to Him. However, man is inclined to see the reason of all his misfortunes in his shrewish wife, angry boss or the people who surround him. How- ever, that is the way it should be, because the Creator is concealed from him. Man has not yet reached the level where he can only see the Creator behind all that happens to him. Moreover, he should react according to his own feelings, not as if it is only the Creator Who exists in the world."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 189 While on the material level, it is impossible to see the spiritual forces in the surrounding objects. We depict the Partzufim very relatively. Though it is said that Gal- galta looks like a thin ray of light, we imagine it in the form of a rectangle to show the correlation between the parts of the Partzuf. The Partzuf with Partzuf with Partzuf its parts is gradually created in man’s sensations. We study how from a point, a Sefira is created in man, then an embryo- Partzuf; next, it grows as man starts receiving the Upper Light into it. It is said, “his feet will ascend onto the Mount of Olives and will stand on it’. Olive oil symbolizes the Ohr Hochma . The entire process of reception and the grading of the Ohr Hochma are extremely complicated. In Hebrew Har (mountain) Har (mount ain) Har also means “Hirhurim” - doubts, sufferings and efforts while climbing a mountain. From below, on our part, this ascent continues until the Machsom , where the spiritual world begins.

It is not a question of the light of the World of Infinity being the Ohr Makif. It means that, when the Stroke Contact took place, the enormous light of the World of Infinity hit the screen of the Malchut de Rosh Galgalta. Although it wished to enter Behina Dalet, as if no TA had ever happened, the screen stopped and reflected it, preventing it from getting inside Behina Dalet (see § 14). This Ohr Hozer has virtually become the vessel of reception of the Upper Light. However, there is a tremendous difference between the reception by Behina Dalet before TA and the reception with the help of the Masach and the Ohr Hozer after it. As we have already said, the light that entered Galgalta is just a thin ray compared to what it was before TA. The part of the Upper Light that could not enter the Partzuf has turned into the Ohr Makif of Galgalta. There is a rule: nothing ever disappears in the spiritual world, hence the light of the World of In- finity that was meant for Behina Dalet has not vanished; it is bound to fulfill its predestination and enter Malchut, so now it starts filling the worlds AK and ABYA, albeit according to a totally different principle. Now the creation gets only that part of the light that it can receive, not for its own sake, but for the sake of the Creator. It happens due to a large number of Stroke Contacts between the light and the Masachim of the worlds and the Partzufim, until Be- hina Dalet corrects itself with their help and reaches the state of"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 191 absolute perfection, conceived by the Creator at the beginning of the creation. Then the entire light of the World of Infinity will enter it; but now the creation will be the Creator’s partner in creating itself, “earning” the reception of the light. Therefore, the Stroke Contact between the light and the Masach does not lead to a disappearance or a transfor- mation of the light. But for the time being, before the Final Correction (the Gmar Tik- kun) the light of Infinity turns into the Ohr Makif (the Surrounding Light), which means that it will have to enter this Partzuf in the future. However, for the present moment it surrounds the Partzuf and shines upon it as if from “outside”. This outside luminescence spreads through all the worlds in the form of corrections, capable of leading Malchut to being completely filled with the light of the World of Infinity. As we have already said, the light reflected by the screen dresses onto the Direct Light (the Ohr Yashar ) and serves as the Kli for receiv- ingthe Ohr Pnimi into the Guf . The Guf . The Guf Ohr Hozer is Kavanah (intention), thanks to which the light can enter the Guf for the sake of the Creator. Guf f or the sak e of the Cr eat or . Guf The screen has enough strength only to dress and receive just a small por- tion of the light into the Toch as compared to the light that Malchut was filled with in Behina Dalet in the world of Ein Sof . The empty desires form Ein Sof . The em p ty desir es f orm Ein Sof the Sof of the Sof of the Sof Partzuf; whereas the light that was unable to enter them and was left around the Partzuf, is called “ the Ohr Makif” . In the spiritual world, all processes take place according to the cause-and-effect relation. There is no time, nothing changes or disap- pears there. All that was continues to be, and everything new merely dresses onto it. The previous continues to exist and is the cause, while all the new becomes its effect."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 192 The screen that pushed away the Ohr Yashar did not prevent it from Ohr Yashar d i d n o t p r e v e n t i t f r o m Ohr Yashar spreading in Malchut, but just gave the process a new form. Now it hap- pens in the way of a partial receiving with the help of numerous “Zivugey de Haka’a” in the five worlds of AK , Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira and Assiya . This process goes on until the Final Correction, when the Behina Dalet will be corrected in all its perfection. Then the light of Infinity will spread into it as it had done before TA . In this process, the Masach has not introduced anything that would interfere with achieving perfection. The light of the World of Infinity will not rest until it fills the en- tire Malchut . So far it surrounds it from outside as the Ohr Makif , ready Makif , r eady Makif to enter it the instant the screen appears. The luminescence of the Ohr Makif is able to correct Makif is able t o corr ect Makif Malchut and allow it to receive the light inside. The light hits the screen, because such is its nature; as it wanted to fill the Behina Aleph , so later it constantly wishes to fill the vessel of re- ception - the “desire to receive”. For example, sometimes man has some kind of a hidden desire; the outside pleasure strikes it and awakens this desire, arouses it. Then man begins to feel that this pleasure wants to enter him. In the spiritual world, each action is new because the creation makes a Zivug de Haka’a on every new portion of the “desire to receive” that has not yet been involved in the correction. Each new action is the effect of the preceding one and the cause of the subsequent one. The light emanating from the Creator is one and the same, simple light; but with each new desire, the Kli singles out the various kinds of pleasure in it that correspond to this new desire. Everything depends on the Kli . According to its inner properties, desires (whether it wants to receive for its own sake or for the sake of the Creator, whether it wants to receive at all) it distinguishes certain kinds of pleasure in the light. The vessel (the Kli ) must be created so that it will be able to pick out all those numerous pleasures in the light that were incorporated in it from the beginning."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 193 On the one hand, the light emanating from the Creator creates the Masachim , screens, which assist the gradual filling of different parts of Malchut with the light, and it continues in this way until the Gmar Tikkun . On the other hand, we must say that the light is the cause that arouses the desire of the Kli, whereupon it should work hard to create its own screen. בחינה ולאבידת המסך להזדככות המביא , בזה זה מ \" ואו פ \" דאו הביטוש ענין נבאר ועתה ( לג במסך שניהם יחד וקשורים מזה זה הפוכים הללו האורות ' ב בהיות כי . דעביות אחרונה . בזה זה ומכים מבטשים כ \" ע , ק \" א דראש שבמלכות הנקראת , דראש שבהמלכות במסך דהיינו , ק \" א דראש בפה הנעשה דהכאה זווג אותו כי : פירוש ליציאת הסבה כ \" ג הוא הנה , שהעלה ח \" האו י \" ע ק \" דא פנימי אור להלבשת הסבה שהיה ,\" פה \" בבחינת לחוץ האור יצא , ד \" בבחי מלהתלבש ס \" א אור על שעיכב מחמת כי . ק \" דא מ \" האו יצא הוא , עצמה ד \" הבחי כמו להלבישו יכול אינו ח \" שהאו האור חלק אותו כל דהיינו . מ \" או . פ \" לאו כמו מקיף לאור שוה סבה הוא שבפה שהמסך הרי . מ \" לאו ונעשה 33) Now, the time has come to learn about the impact between the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Pnimi, which leads to a thinning of the screen and the subsequent loss of its highest level of Aviut. These two kinds of light have quite opposite properties, although the screen, positioned in Malchut's Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf, inseparably con- nects them. They are in constant contradiction, leading to concussion between them. The same Zivug de Haka’a that happened on this screen, on the one hand, called forth a filling of the Partzuf with the Inner Light (the Ohr Pnimi); on the other hand, the same Zivug de Haka’a produced the Surrounding Light (the Ohr Makif). In this way, it prevented the light of Infinity from entering Behina Dalet. The screen, positioned at the Peh de Rosh divides the simple light descending from above into two contrary, albeit, connected kinds: the Ohr Pnimi , partially received inside by the Partzuf with the help of the Partzuf with the help of the Partzuf Ohr Hozer and the Hozer and the Hozer Ohr Makif , which the screen prevents from entering the Ohr Makif , whic h the scr een pr ev ents fr om ent ering the Ohr Makif Guf (Behina Dalet) and leaves it outside."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 194 Thanks to the same intention of man (to receive for the Creator’s sake), one part of the light is received, while the other is left outside. The Partzuf (man) receives exactly as much light as he can receive with the Partzuf (man) r eceiv es e x actly as muc h light as he can r eceiv e w ith the Partzuf intention for the sake of the Creator. ובה . לזה זה הפוכות בפעולות אלא , במסך קשורים שניהם מ \" והאו פ \" שהאו ונתבאר ( לד הוא כן , המלבישו ח \" האו י \" ע הפרצוף לפנימיות העליון מאור חלק ממשיך שהמסך במדה הוא גדול מ \" לאו מבחוץ הנשאר האור שחלק ומתוך . בהפרצוף מלהתלבש מ \" או את מרחיק , אותו המרחיק במסך מכה שהוא נבחן כ \" ע , ק \" בא מלהתלבש עליו המעכב המסך מפאת , מאוד . הפרצוף בפנימיות להתלבש רוצה שהוא במה בפנימיותו להתלבש הרוצה , מ \" באו מכה שבמסך וקשיות העביות כח אשר , כ \" ג נבחן ולעומתו והעביות מ \" שהאו ההכאות ואלו . הזווג בעת העליון באור מכה שהוא ד \" ע , עליו ומעכב בגוף רק ביניהם נעשה זה ביטוש אמנם .\" פ \" באו מ \" האו ביטוש \" מכונים , בזה זה מכים שבמסך כ \" משא . לכלי מחוץ מ \" האו את המשאיר , בכלים האור התלבשות ענין ניכר שם כי , הפרצוף אלא , כלל לכלים נחשב ח \" האו אין שם כי , הזה הביטוש ענין נוהג אינו שם , דראש ס \" בע . לבד דקים לשרשים לבחינת מבחוץ הנשאר באור להבחין עד , מוגבל פ \" לאו נחשב שבהם האור אין זה ומשום אחר רק אלא . דראש ס \" בע מ \" ואו פ \" דאו הכאה שייך לא , ביניהם הזה הבחן שאין וכיון . מ \" או ס \" הע שהם , בכלים האורות מתלבשים ששם , דגוף ס \" לע ולמטה מפה מתפשטים שהאורות שנשאר מקיף האור ובין הכלים שבתוך פ \" האו בין הכאה שם נעשה כ \" ע , ולמטה שמפה ח \" דאו . מבחוץ 34) The Ohr Pnimi and the Ohr Makif are concerned with the Masach, even though their actions are contrary to one another. Ac- cording to the ability of the Masach to let a part of the Ohr Yashar that has dressed on the Ohr Hozer inside the Partzuf, it prevents the Ohr Makif from entering it. The amount of the Surrounding Light left outside the Partzuf exceeds by far the Ohr Pnimi. The screen, with its Aviut and Kashiut, does not allow the Ohr Makif to enter the Partzuf as much as it resists the Ohr Yashar. The concussion between the Ohr Makif and the screen’s Aviut is called Bitush – the impact between the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Pnimi. This impact happens only in the Guf of the Partzuf, since that is where the reception of the light in the vessels took place; however, a considerable part of the light was left outside. In the 10 Sefirot"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 195 de Rosh, this impact does not occur, for the Ohr Hozer is not yet re- garded as a true vessel of reception. It only forms the Shorshey Kelim (roots, sources of the vessels). Therefore, the light that is in them is not yet genuine Ohr Pnimi . Due to the same reason, the Ohr Makif cannot be distinguished there ei- Ohr Makif canno t be dis tinguished ther e ei- Ohr Makif ther. Since there is still no difference between them, there cannot be any impact in the Rosh of the Partzuf . Only after the light spreads downwards Partzuf . Only af t er the light spr eads do wn w ar ds Partzuf from the Peh by way of the 10 Sefirot de Guf (where the lights dress into Sefirot de Guf (wher e the lights dr ess int o Sefirot de Guf the vessels, i.e., the 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light), then the impact between the Ohr Pnimi and the Ohr Makif takes place. Ohr Makif t ak es place. Ohr Makif The amount of Ohr Makif surrounding the Ohr Makif surr ounding the Ohr Makif Partzuf is incomparably greater than the Ohr Pnimi inside it. In an attempt to enter the Partzuf, the Ohr Makif strikes the Ohr Makif s trik es the Ohr Makif Masach that gave birth to it. What does it mean that the Ohr Makif strikes the screen? Ohr Makif s trik es the scr een? Ohr Makif Malchut has a passionate desire to receive pleasure. It feels that the light contains just the pleasure it would so much like to receive. Hence, it begins to attract the light. This demonstrates that, in order to feel and then receive pleasure, one should have an appropriate vessel, a vessel that has passed through an intricate inner development. Why do we perceive the Ohr Makif as Ohr Makif as Ohr Makif being outside us? Because, in the Sof of each Sof of eac h Sof Partzuf, there are unfilled desires that feel the light as pleasures that are so far out of their reach. Or rather, these empty desires feel as though the outer light strikes them, “demanding” to be enjoyed. Mutual strokes of the Surrounding Light (pleasure), with the desire of Malchut to receive pleasure and the strength of the screen resisting these desires, are called the Bitush Pnim u Makif , the impact between the Bitush Pnim u Makif , the im pact be tw een the Bitush Pnim u Makif Inner and the Surrounding Lights. Strictly speaking, the Ohr Makif nor Ohr Makif nor Ohr Makif the Ohr Pnimi do not collide. Rather, both of them strike into the screen between them. It happens in the Masach positioned in the Tabur of the Tabur of the Tabur Partzuf, where the reception of the light clearly ends. It becomes clear only in the Tabur how much light (pleasure) en- Tabur ho w muc h light (pleasur e) en- Tabur tered the Partzuf , and how much remained outside of it. In the 10 Partzuf , and ho w muc h r emained outside of it. In the 1 0 Partzuf Sefirot"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 196 de Rosh, there is no such impact, because the Ohr Hozer is not yet the Ohr Hozer is no t y e t the Ohr Hozer vessel for receiving the Ohr Yashar , but serves only as an embryo of the Kli. The impact begins only after the Ohr Yashar , dressed in the intention (the Ohr Hozer ), spreads into the Toch down to the Tabur . Spirituality cannot be attained through the mind; the spiritual Kli is a sense that does not understand the Creator, but feels Him. If man can feel the Creator, the spiritual realm, then understanding gradually comes to him. לשרשו אותו ומעלה , עוביותו מכל המסך את מזכך מ \" שהאו עד , נמשך הזה הביטוש והנה ( לה ועביות מסך \" המכונה , למטה שממעלה העביות כל ממנו שמזכך , כלומר . דראש שבפה העליון .\" פה \" הנקרא , דראש דמלכות המסך בחינת שהוא , דגוף השורש רק בו נשאר ולא .\" דגוף רק נשאר ולא . מ \" לאו פ \" או בין החוצץ שהוא , למטה שממעלה העביות מכל שנזדכך דהיינו הצורה שהשואת ונודע . מ \" לאו פ \" מאו ההבדל נעשה לא עוד ששם , למעלה שממטה העביות נשאר ולא , הגוף של עביות מכל דגוף המסך שנזדכך אחר כ \" ע . אחד להיות הרוחניים מדביק עמו נכלל הנה , דראש המסך אל שוה צורתו ונעשה , דראש דפה למסך השוה עביות רק בו לפה עלה דגוף שהמסך , מכונה וזה . לשנים אותם שיחלק מה ביניהם אין כי , ממש אחד להיות דפה שבמסך דהכאה בזווג שוב נכלל נמצא , דראש בהמסך דגוף המסך שנכלל וכיון . דראש \" ק \" דא ב \" ע \" הנקרא , חדשה בקומה ס \" ע בו ויוצאות . מחדש דהכאה זווג עליו ונעשה , דראש . ק \" דא ' הא הפרצוף של ותולדה לבן נחשב והוא .\" ק \" דא חכמה פרצוף \" או 35) This impact continues until the Ohr Makif liquidates the Aviut of Masach de Guf in the Tabur. As a result of this, the Masach de Guf starts ascending towards the screen, positioned at the Peh de Rosh, which is the root, the cause of the screen de Guf. After merging with the screen in the Peh de Rosh, the Masach of Tabur also gets involved in the Zivug de Haka’a, which is constantly taking place between the Masach in Peh de Rosh and the light. This Zivug results in the formation of a new Partzuf and the emergence of 10 new Se- firot called AB de AK or the Partzuf Hochma of the world of Adam Kadmon. In relation to the first Partzuf Galgalta-Keter, this new Partzuf is considered its result, its “son”. The Surrounding light puts great pressure upon the screen in an attempt to enter the Kli that ispositioned at the Tabur. However, the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 197 Masach cannot bear it. On the one hand, it is unable to receive more light with the intention for the sake of the Creator; on the other hand, it cannot remain under such pressure. Therefore, the best solution is to return to its previous state in the Peh de Rosh , altogether refusing to receive the light. The Masach begins to rise from the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Peh . On its way, it banishes all the light from the Kli and merges with the Masach in Peh de Rosh , i.e., it returns to the previous state where the light was only in the Rosh of the Partzuf, but absent from the Guf of the Guf of the Guf Partzuf. The small pleasure that the Kli enjoyed by receiving the light in the Toch has given it an idea of the great pleasure that is waiting outside. Reception of this pleasure only weakened the screen. It is much easier to refuse altogether a certain pleasure than to receive it in small portions, for the pleasure that was received inside weakens the will power, i.e., the intention to receive pleasure for the sake of the Creator. As Ohr Pnimi and Ohr Makif both press upon the screen with their Ohr Makif bo th pr ess upon the scr een with their Ohr Makif pleasure, the screen weakens under this double pressure, and is forced completely to stop receiving the light. It gets free from all the Aviut , rises to the Peh de Rosh and fully merges with the Masach , which receives noth- ing at all, but just pushes the light away. Further on, the material studied may become more technical, but one should not despair. Studying Kabbalah is a complicated inner pro- cess. Sometimes Kabbalah is perceived in sensations (and it is the best way), but sometimes it is not perceived at all. That is natural. One should continue with persistent learning. At a certain mo- ment, you will feel the material penetrating inside. Meanwhile, even if it is impossible to understand, one should continue to study so as not to lose touch with the general scheme, and at each time add another new element to it. The general scheme looks like this: the light, gradually growing thicker and thicker, creates the Kli out of itself and for itself . out of itself and for itself . out of itself and for itself The Kli"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 198 passes through four phases of its development, turning into Malchut, i.e., the only creation. Then the aim becomes complete separation of it from the Creator; the creation should feel neither the Ohr Pnimi nor the Ohr Makif , i.e., nei- Ohr Makif , i . e . , n e i - Ohr Makif ther inner, nor outer pleasures, which could dictate their conditions to it. It needs to acquire absolute freedom of will and the possibility of its own desires and actions, directed at the correction of its egoistic de- sires and spiritual advancement towards the Creator. The first independent desire of Malchut was to become like the Creator in its properties. That is why it makes the First Restriction on its “desire to receive”, on Behina Dalet , and leaves it without the light. Then it creates the system of descending worlds. The spiritual worlds are noth- ing but the phases of restriction; they are curtains, screens. In all, there are five of them: the worlds of AK and AK and AK ABYA (Adam Kadmon, Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira and Assiya). Upon creating the worlds from above down to the lowest point, the creation finds itself in absolute emptiness and darkness; it does not feel the Creator at all. Humankind is in such state. When, as a result of studying, man begins to vaguely feel that the Ohr Makif shines on him, that the omnipotent Creator is hiding somewhere Makif s h i n e s o n h i m , t h a t t h e o m n i p o t e n t C r e a t o r i s h i d i n g s o m e w h e r e Makif behind it all, that each phenomenon has its own cause and effect, it means that he is already on a certain spiritual level called the Olam Hazeh . Now we are studying the descending structure of all the screens and the worlds that conceal the Creator from Malchut . Then, if Malchut, by the power of its own desire, creates the screen, protecting it from the light-pleasure, it becomes, as it were, equal to this screen, this level, and the screen serves as revelation of the Creator. If man independently desires to observe all 620 laws of the Cre- ator’s revelation, they stop being restrictive for him, and then the cor- responding screen is neutralized on each level. Man acquires the prop- erties of the screen, and there is no sense in concealing the Creator on"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 199 this phase, since there is no danger that he will receive the light for his own sake. While spiritually ascending, Kabbalists internally perceive all these processes, having previously studied the descent of the worlds. On the one hand, it is necessary to study Kabbalah to acquire knowledge; on the other hand, man should feel everything he studies. , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש ענין עליו גם חזר , וגוף בראש ונשלם יצא ק \" דא ב \" ע שפרצוף ואחר ( לו עד , דגוף עביות מכל כ \" ג נזדכך שלו דגוף והמסך . ק \" דא ' הא בפרצוף לעיל שנתבאר ד \" ע . שלו דראש מסך לבחינת צורתו שהשוה קומה שהוציא , מחדש דהכאה זווג עליו ונעשה . שלו דראש שבפה בזווג שנכלל אז ונמצא פרצוף של ותולדה לבן נחשב והוא .\" ק \" דא ג \" ס \" הנקרא , בינה קומת בשיעור , ס \" ע של חדשה . ולמטה ק \" דא ג \" שמס הפרצופים כ \" ג יצאו ז \" ועד . שלו דראש דפה מהזווג יצא כי , ק \" דא ב \" הע 36) After the Partzuf AB de AK was born and completed its develop- ment by forming the Rosh and the Guf, the process of the Bitush Ohr Pnimi be Ohr Makif resumed in it, as in the first Partzuf of AK. Its Masach de Guf (the screen of its spiritual body) gradually lost all its Aviut and merged its properties with the Masach de Rosh. Now this Masach happens to be involved in a Zivug between the Upper Light and the screen that is positioned in the Peh de Rosh. In it the Zivug de Haka’a was renewed and gave birth to a new Partzuf at the level of Bina, which is called SAG de AK. It is considered to be the consequence of the Partzuf AB de AK, since it emerges be- cause of a Zivug on the Masach positioned at the Peh de Rosh. The Partzufim, starting from SAG and further down, emerge according to the same principle. As it was stated, the second Partzuf AB of the world AK was formed after Galgalta; it felt Bitush Pnim u Makif, expelled the light, then brought the screen de Guf and the screen at Peh de Rosh together. Then AB felt the pressure of those two lights and behaved exactly as Galgalta did, i.e., it began to get rid of its Aviut Gimel . It raised the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 200 Masach de Guf to the Guf t o the Guf Peh de Rosh , where Zivugim constantly take place, and became equal to it in its properties. This means that it stops receiving pleasure for the sake of the Cre- ator. Then a new Zivug de Haka’a takes place on this screen, but on a new portion of egoism, one that corresponds to the level of Bina . This is how the third Partzuf SAG de AK was formed. AK w as f ormed. AK When Malchut of the World of Infinity performed TA and estab- lished the screen, four Behinot lay between it and the Creator. The light cannot reach it through these four Behinot , and Malchut understands that it is absolutely remote from the Creator. This is a most terrible state, where it is ready completely to rid itself of the infinite delight, whoseab- sence turns into suffering, pain and bitterness. Now, thanks to the screen, it begins to see the light of the four Behinot and understands that the Creator wants it to receive pleasure. It makes a calculation and receives a small part of the light, from the Peh down to the Tabur . As soon as Malchut receives this small portion of the light, it starts feeling the pressure from the Ohr Makif in the Tabur , which wants to enter it, paying no attention to TA . Malchut finds itself at an impasse, for it cannot receive the light just yet; so it should somehow get out of this situation. The way out consists in returning to the initial state. However, by making the first screen, it has already placed a curtain between itself and the Creator, thus creating the first Partzuf and receiving 20 per cent of the light. What Partzuf and r eceiving 20 per cent of the light. What Partzuf is it supposed to do when the remaining 80 per cent of the light comes to it? The way out is to try working with a smaller amount of egoism for the sake of the Creator and make the screen for it. For example, Ruben asks Simon to wake him up at 2 a.m. that he might be able to come to the lesson on time. On the next day, he turns to Simon: “It is so hard for me to get up at 2 a.m., please wake me up at 3 a.m.”. The next day, regretting it all, he asks to wake him up at four in the morning, then at five. Seeing that even this is difficult for him, he altogether stops coming to the lessons..."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 201 If earlier Malchut could liken itself to the Creator in 20 per cent, it tries now to do it to a lesser degree; by making the screen for 15 per cent of the light, (the numbers serve strictly as an example). Thus, Malchut is separated from the Creator by two screens. It then becomes even more remote from Him. By creating these Partzufim , Malchut tries to liken itself to Behina Shoresh , Aleph, Bet, and Gimel of the Direct Light, to the Creator’s proper- ties. However, the egoistic core made the Tzimtzum . Becoming like the Creator in these Behinot , it isolated itself from Him, as it were, by these Partzufim creating an empty space. Now being spiritually empty, it can independently look for the way to become like the Creator. Although we endow these Partzufim with the properties of living beings, we should nevertheless understand that they are not actually alive. They are the weakening screens that shield the spiritual delight from the egoistic desire to receive pleasure. Only man’s soul, which we will discuss later, feels the Creator; therefore, only the soul is a living being. All the rest of the objects are no more than robots, programmed by the Creator to fulfill this or that function, which is somehow connected with man’s correction. All newly created Partzufim, levels and their previous states, exist at the same time. An example can be given by analogy with a movie. The scrolled film disappears from our field of sight, but it exists as if in a still state. Similarly, each previous Partzuf is like a sequence in this film. The entire picture, from the first moment and until the last one, is very diverse. A great number of actions take place in it, but all togeth- er, because of merging of the present, past and future states, form one sphere, a closed system. The lower Partzufim can influence the higher ones, because through them they receive the light from the World of Infinity. For example the Partzuf AB , which receives the light from Galgalta , forces it to change too, for the light passing through it is already similar"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 202 to the properties of AB , which alsotransforms Galgalta . From this follows the diversity, interconnection, and interdependency of all the spiritual processes. The very last desire of Malchut , which realized that it is absolutely contrary to the Creator in its properties, that wants to receive only for the sake of itself without giving anything in return, is called the true “cre- ation”, or “the soul”. Although we are not there yet, this very part of Mal- chut is the “material” of which a human soul will be created later on. The rest is not the creation, but only an auxiliary tool for the merg- ing of the creation with the Creator. These forces assist the Creator in governing creation. There are only two existing entities: the Creator and the creation. Everything else is the system of their communication, with whose help they find one another. The Partzufim do not make the actions. Being on a certain level and performing actions corresponding to this or that Partzuf , Kabbalists Partzuf , K abbalis ts Partzuf see the light that they can push away and consequently receive it inside. All Kabbalistic books appeared in the following way: a Kabbalist, ascend- ing the spiritual levels, describes his spiritual sensations on paper... The entire world of AK is similar to AK is similar t o AK Malchut of Ein Sof, on the level of Shoresh ; Atzilut is similar to Malchut on the level of Behina Aleph ; Beria corresponds to Behina Bet of Malchut; Yetzira - to Behina Gimel , and the world of Assiya is similar to Behina Dalet of Malchut . The light in Galgalta is the Ohr Nefesh . המזכך , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש מכח הנעשה , מזה למטה זה הפרצופים יציאת נתבאר והנה ( לז בפה הנוהג , דהכאה בזווג שם נכלל ואז . דראש דפה מסך לבחינת שמחזירו עד דגוף המסך . דראש ובדרך . הקודם פרצוף אל לבן נבחן זו חדשה שקומה . ס \" ע של חדשה קומה זווגו י \" ע ומוציא המדרגות יתר וכן . ג \" ס מפרצוף ה \" והמ , ב \" ע מפרצוף ג \" והס , הכתר מפרצוף ב \" הע יצא הזה . ד \" בחי על ולא ג \" בחי על רק ב \" דע ס \" הע יצאו למה : להבין צריכים עוד אלא . ע \" ואבי בנקודים לא ולמה ? עליונו כלפי אחת במדרגה נמוך תחתון שכל , דהיינו ?' וכו ב \" בחי על רק ג \" הס וכן ? שוה בקומה מזה זה כולם יצאו"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 203 37) Thus, we have made clear the consecutive emerging of the Partzu- fim (one under another), which happened due to the impact between the Inner and the Surrounding Lights (Bitush Ohr Pnimi u Makif). This impact weakens the Masach so that it loses its strength and returns to the Peh de Rosh (coincides with it in its qualities), thus getting involved in the Zivug de Haka’a constantly occurring at the Masach de Rosh. Owing to this Zivug, a new Partzuf emerges as an offspring of the pre- vious one. So AB is a result of the Partzuf Keter, SAG is an offshoot of AB, MA – of SAG and so on in all subsequent levels of the worlds of Nikudim and ABYA. However, we also have to understand why the Partzuf AB can only reach the level of Behina Gimel and not Dalet. SAG reaches only Behina Bet. I.e., each following Partzuf is one level lower than the previous. Why are they not all equal? שיצא מאחר כי . ק \" דא ' הא פרצוף של לתולדה ב \" דע ס \" הע נחשב למה , להבין יש ותחילה ( לח פרצוף מבחינת יצא במה כ \" וא . עצמו הפרצוף דגוף ס \" הע כמו ,' הא דפרצוף דראש דפה מהזווג ? אליו ותולדה שני כפרצוף נחשב להיות ,' הא . א : בפרצוף מלכיות מיני ' ב יש כי . דגוף למסך דראש ממסך הגדול ההפרש כאן שתבין וצריך בכח , המסיימת מלכות היא . ב , העליון אור עם , בה המתוקן המסך בכח , המזדווגת מלכות הוא . דגוף ס \" שבע העליון אור את , בה המתוקן המסך אור עם דהכאה בזווג המזדווגת דראש המלכות כי . מנאצל מאציל כרחוק ביניהם וההפרש עם העליון אור הרחיק לא בה המתוקן המסך כי . הגוף אל מאציל לבחינת נחשבת , העליון בבחינת העליון האור את והמשיך הלביש , שהעלה חוזר אור י \" שע , אדרבא אלא , בו הכאתו , ח \" דאו בהכלי העליון דאור ס \" הע שנתלבשו עד למטה ממעלה מתפשט ונמצא . דראש ס \" ע .\" גוף \" הנקרא בחינת שום עדיין ניכר ולא , דגוף ס \" להע מאציל בבחינת דראש והמלכות המסך נבחן כ \" וע ס \" שהע שאחר , שפירושו , דגוף והמלכות המסך כ \" משא . הזאת ומלכות במסך ומדחה מגביל אור כי . ההם ס \" שבע המלכות עד רק מתפשטים אינם , למטה ממעלה דראש מפה נתפשטו מלהתפשט המעכבו שם המתוקן המסך מפני , דגוף המלכות תוך להתפשט יכול אינו העליון . הפרצוף על וסיום סוף ונעשה שם הפרצוף נפסק כ \" וע . המלכות אל הביטוש כל ולפיכך . הגוף של הזאת והמלכות בהמסך רק מתגלה והגבול הצמצום כח שכל הרי מלהאיר מ \" האו את ומרחיק המגביל הוא כי , בלבד דגוף במסך רק נעשה אינו פ \" באו מ \" דאו"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 204 , האורות ומלביש הממשיך רק הוא הראש של המסך כי , דראש במסך ולא . הפרצוף בפנימיות . משהו אף בו מתגלה הגבול כח עדיין ואין 38) First, we have to understand why the Partzuf AB is regarded as the offspring of the Partzuf Keter. After its birth because of the Zivug at Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf Galgalta, its height corresponds precisely to the 10 Sefirot de Guf of the Partzuf. So why is it unable to continue as part of the Partzuf Galgalta and not as an individual Partzuf, the result of the first one? Here you should realize what an enormous difference there is between the Masach de Guf and the Masach de Rosh. There are two kinds of Malchut in the Partzuf. The first is Malchut Mizdaveget, i.e., Malchut that interacts with the Upper Light owing to its corrected intentions (Masach); the second is Malchut Mesayemet, which with the help of its screen prevents the spreading of the Upper Light into the 10 Sefirot de Guf of the Partzuf. The distinction between them is as great as between the Creator and the creation. It is because Malchut de Rosh ,in the Stroke Contact with the Upper Light, is considered to be the Creator as regards the Guf of Partzuf. Its screen does not push away the light when it strikes. Rather, following the dressing of the Ohr Hozer onto the Ohr Yashar, the 10 Sefirot de Rosh emerge, allowing the light to spread downwards, until the 10 Sefirot of the Upper Light dress in the Kli de Ohr Hozer, called the Guf (body of the Partzuf). Hence, the Masach and Malchut de Rosh are regarded as the Cre- ator for the 10 Sefirot de Guf. However, so far there is absolutely no resisting power in this Malchut and in its Masach. It will happen thanks to Malchut and the Masach of the Guf de Partzuf. Let us explain: after the 10 Sefirot spread from the Peh de Rosh downwards, they could only reach the Malchut of these 10 Sefirot, for the Upper Light cannot spread into Malchut de Guf. The Masach positioned"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 205 there prevents the light from filling it; therefore, the Partzuf ends and the Behina Sof (End of Partzuf) appears there. Since all the power of the Restriction manifests in this Masach of Malchut de Guf, the impact between the Inner and the Surrounding Lights occurs only in the Masach de Guf (the screen of the body) of the Partzuf. It restrains and repels the Ohr Makif, preventing it from shining inside the Partzuf. The Masach de Rosh does not do it, since it only attracts and dresses the light, but the resisting power is not yet apparent in it. As we have already said, there are two screens in each Partzuf . The Partzuf . The Partzuf first is at Peh de Rosh , which says that it will not receive pleasure for its own sake; hence, it pushes away all the light. The second is the Masach de Guf , which appears together with the intention to receive the light for Guf , whic h appear s t oge ther with the int ention t o r eceiv e the light f or Guf the sake of the Creator, i.e., to dress it into the Ohr Hozer . This Masach descends with the light and ascends when the light exits the Guf . The first screen is always in action and is in the spiritual Guf . The f ir s t scr een is alw a y s in action and is in the spiritual Guf world. The second one determines the position of the Kli on the straight line from zero level until the Gmar Tikkun . These two screens do not contradict one another. מסך לבחינת להיות המסיימת דמלכות המסך חזר , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש שמכח , ונתבאר ( לט העביות מכל המסיים המסך את טיהר מקיף דאור הביטוש כי .( ה \" ל אות ) המזדווגת ומלכות . דראש דמסך לעביות השוות , ההיא מהעביות דקות רשימות רק בו נשאר ולא , בו שהיה דגוף השווה דגוף שהמסך אחר , לפיכך . בזה זה הרוחניים ומיחד מדביק הצורה שהשתוות ונודע כח קבל ואז . אחד מסך היו כאלו עמו ונעשה בו נכלל תיכף הנה , דראש למסך עביותו צורת . דראש מסך כמו , דהכאה לזווג הרשימות דגוף במסך בו נתחדשו , זה זווגו עם יחד אמנם . החדשה דקומה ס \" הע עליו ויצאו למסך בינו שיעור באיזה הצורה שינוי שוב בו וניכר חזר ואז . מתחילה בו שהיו , דגוף דעביות . דעליון דראש מהפה ומוציאהו מבדילהו הזה השינוי של והכר . עמו הנכלל דראש עוד לעמוד יכול אינו אז הנה , דעליון ולמטה מפה שהוא , הראשון מקורו וניכר שחזר אחר כי משם לירד שהוכרח ונמצא . מזה זה הרוחניים מפריד הצורה שינוי כי . דעליון מפה למעלה של הראש אפילו כי . העליון כלפי שני לגוף בהכרח נבחן ולפיכך . דעליון ולמטה שמפה למקום . שלו דגוף ממסך נמשך להיותו , בלבד כגופו העליון כלפי נבחן החדשה הקומה"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 206 כולה היא החדשה שהקומה וכיון . נבדלים גופים ' לב אותם מבדיל הזו הצורה שינוי ולפיכך . ממנו הנמשך ענף וכמו , אליו כבן נחשב כ \" ע , הקודם פרצוף של דגוף המסך של תולדה 39) As stated above, the impacts between the Ohr Pnimi and the Ohr Makif have turned the Masach of Malchut Mesayemet into the Masach of Malchut, which makes a Zivug at Peh de Rosh. The Bitush of the Ohr Makif so weakened the restraining power of the Masach that, out of all the Aviut de Guf of Masach de Rosh, only the thin Reshimot (equal to Aviut of Masach de Rosh) remained, which led to the merging of the Masach de Guf with the Masach de Rosh. As a result, it enabled the Masach de Guf to make the same Zivug de Haka’a as the Masach de Rosh. Out of this Zivug emerged a new Partzuf that has its own 10 Sefirot, whose level is one-step lower than the preceding one. At the same time, the Reshimot de Aviut that had originally been in the Masach de Guf were renewed there; therefore, the difference between the prop- erties of both screens reappears. This difference separates the Masach de Guf from the Masach de Rosh. When its true nature manifests, it cannot remain in the Peh of the higher Partzuf, since in the spiritual world the changing of properties separates one object from another. Therefore, it is forced to descend and become an individual Partzuf. Even the Rosh of the new Partzuf is at the level of the Guf of the higher one, because it was born out of its Masach de Guf. This distinction between them divides them into two different Partzufim, and since the new Partzuf emerged out of the Masach de Guf of the previous one, it relates to its superior as a branch relates to its root. The Reshimot are the Ohr Makif , which was inside the Ohr Makif , whic h w as inside the Ohr Makif Partzuf and Partzuf and Partzuf exited it. That is why it retains a special connection with the Kli . The screen has already made a Zivug de Haka’a on its previous desires, received the light and made sure that it has reached only the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 207 Tabur. It knows that this way is wrong and cannot lead to the Gmar Tik- kun . Now, when its desires to receive the light for the sake of the Creator reactivate, they emerge one level lower. This means that the new Partzuf will receive the light on a lesser level. The first and second portions of the light are added together to equal the total quantity of the light that entered Malchut of the World of Infinity. Now Malchut has to receive all the light that was inside it before TA , with the new intention to receive, not for its own sake, but to please the Creator, i.e., with the help of the Masach and the Ohr Hozer. The second Partzuf differs in its properties from the first; hence, it emerges not from the Peh , as the previous one did, but lower than the Peh , i.e., it is as if it is a head shorter than the previous Partzuf. Even its head is considered the Guf of the previous Guf o f t h e p r e v i o u s Guf Partzuf, because it emerges from the Masach de Guf of the previous Masach de Guf o f t h e p r e v i o u s Masach de Guf Partzuf. The second Partzuf is a complete outcome of the first one and branches off it as a frond out of the trunk. When the first Masach at the Peh de Rosh pushes away the light, it puts itself into an independent position as regards the giver. The second Masach in the Guf says that it can receive even for the sake of the host. It Guf sa y s that it can r eceiv e ev en f or the sak e of the hos t. It Guf has five desires; the Partzuf fills each of them by 20 per cent. The rest of the desires remain unfilled, because the Masach is not strong enough. By receiving the light inside, the second screen descends. The Ohr Makif continues to interact with the Makif c o n t i n u e s t o i n t e r a c t w i t h t h e Makif Partzuf; it presses and tries to fill the remaining desires. The Masach de Guf cannot withstand it, and ascends to Guf c a n n o t w i t h s t a n d i t , a n d a s c e n d s t o Guf the level of the Masach de Rosh , and the light leaves the Partzuf. The united Masach makes a new Zivug , and as a result, a new Partzuf appears one level below the previous one and it differs in the quality of the light. The peculiarity is that the Partzuf AB is not born from the Masach de Rosh of Galgalta , but from the Masach de Guf . It is strange, because a Guf . It is s tr ange, because a Guf Zi- vug on the vug on the vug Behina Gimel took place in the Rosh of Galgalta . It is explained in “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”, part three, answer 310. While the Masach de Guf , i.e., the Guf , i.e., the Guf Masach de Behina Dalet, ascends to the Peh de Rosh ,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 208 it unites with the Aviut de Rosh , which is “an ascending Aviut ”. However, it is an Aviut of Behina Gimel , and not Dalet , because the Aviut of Behina Dalet is the Masach de Guf , which has never used the de Guf , whic h has nev er used the de Guf Aviut Gimel . Here we can determine two major notions: 1) The Essence . This is the Masach de Guf and it rises to the Guf and it rises t o the Guf Rosh , demanding to be filled. That is why the Masach de Rosh of Galgalta makes a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Behina Gimel . When the essence of the elevated Masach becomes clear, it descends into the Guf again, not to the Guf again, no t t o the Guf Tabur (Behina Dalet), but to the Chazeh (Behina Gimel). This Behina is not called “the son or offspring”, but the “Partzuf AB Pnimi”, i.e., the Partzuf AB , which spreads into the empty inner Kelim of Galgalta of Galgalt a of and is considered the Guf de Galgalta, because it emerged from a Zivug in the Rosh of Galgalta. of Galgalt a. of 2) The Inclusion . After the Masach de Guf descends to the Masach de Guf descends t o the Masach de Guf Chazeh, the Reshimot of the “descending” Aviut are activated during their pres- ence in the Malchut de Rosh. It turns out that, as regards the AB Pnimi, this is the Masach HaMe- sayem (limiting the spreading of the light), born from a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Aviut Gimel at the Peh de Rosh of Galgalta . However, regarding the property of “the inclusion”, it is Masach HaMizdaveg (interacting with the light). Then it attracts the light again, making a Zivug de Haka’a on the Behina Gimel, so that the Rosh AB emerges from the Chazeh up to the Peh de Galgalta. The Peh de AB is at the level of the Chazeh de Galgalta, while the Guf de AB spreads downward to the Tabur of Galgalta. It turns out that the AB Pnimi spreads into the Kelim de Galgalta and the AB Hitzon (outside) dresses onto it so that even its Rosh is in the place of the Guf of Galgalta . The AB Pnimi spreads from the Rosh of Galgalta (Behina Dalet) into the empty Kelim of the Behina Dalet, but the AB Hitzon has absolutely no connection with the Behina Dalet. Two united objects are completely similar in their desires. As much as the Masach can withstand egoism, the Kli becomes similar to the Cre-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 209 ator in its properties, receiving the light inside with the intention for the Creator’s sake. A comparison of the properties is a comparison of the intentions, but it does not mean that both of them become one and the same object. They remain two objects, but their properties are so close that, at this moment, from our point of view, there is no difference. The more the Partzuf receives, the more it becomes similar to the Creator in its intention, and the less in its action. To become equal with the Creator, one should develop one’s egoism, to receive more for His sake, but that will lead to an even bigger difference between the creation and the Creator in action. When the Masach at the Peh de Rosh pushes away all the light, it becomes, as it were, similar in action to the Creator (it does not receive either), but it is isolated from Him in its intention. The method of self-restraint is wrong. There is no need to fast and give up pleasures; on the contrary, the Creator increases man’s egoism to the extent that he can apply the screen and work with it. So out of the two above-mentioned screens, the screen of the Guf can lead out into Guf can lead out int o Guf the spiritual. However, if the screen is only at the Peh de Rosh, then man is as if a stone that does not need anything, has no inner movement. It has always been unclear how egoism can lead to the spiritual, when the purpose of the Creation implies reception of delight. The Kli does not see what is outside it. All our names: the “Ohr Makif” , “presses from outside”, “hasn’t entered yet” – are notions be- longing to the language of our world that we need to imagine somehow a spiritual action. Nevertheless, there is in fact no light pressing from outside, and there is no delight in it. Man’s internal Kli will feel pleasure, if this light is inside it. Hence, in order to have an appetite sufficient for the pleasure, I must somehow imagine and sense this pleasure. The light is an inner reaction of the Kli for some kind of influence emanated by the Creator, i.e., the light corresponds to our “resistance”. Everything depends on"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 210 how the Kli will react to this influence. Only the Ohr Pnimi that enters the Kli is the measure of similarity to the Creator. All of the Partzufim, from the World of Infinity down to our world, were born according to the same principle: the lower Partzuf was born from the higher one. Man should never think about what will happen to him at the next moment. One should always use the present moment, constantly trying to penetrate into its depth. The next moment will be born out of this one; but one should neither wait for it to come nor think about what it will be like. The entrance into the spiritual world depends on inner penetration into the present. קומה שיעור מבחינת יוצא תחתון כל כי , והוא . לעליון מהתחתון בהבדל נוסף דבר עוד ויש ( מ .( ב \" כ אות ) שבמסך בחינות ' שבה אחרת הכלים של התחתונה והבחינה , דעליון האורות של העליונה הבחינה חסר תחתון וכל . דעליון דעביות אחרונה בחינה את מהמסך להאביד , במסך מ \" דאו הביטוש מטבע כי , הוא והטעם , ד \" לבחי עד דהיינו , שלו עביות בחינות ' ה כל לו יש שהמסך , ק \" דא ' הא בפרצוף , ולמשל . שלו ממנו מניח ואינו , לגמרי ד \" דבחי העביות את מזכך , דגוף בהמסך מ \" דאו הביטוש י \" ע הנה . ההיא העביות של רשימו אפילו בראש נכלל ההוא כשהמסך , ולפיכך . במסך נשארים ולמעלה ג \" דבחי מהעביות הרשימות ורק רק יוצא הזווג נמצא , מהגוף שלו בהרשימות שנשאר העביות על דהכאה זווג שם ומקבל הקומה כ \" וע . שם ואינה נאבדה ד \" דבחי דעביות הרשימו כי , בלבד שבמסך דעביות ג \" בחי על פרצוף \" או \" ק \" דא ב \" דע ה \" הוי \" הנקרא , לבד חכמה קומת בשיעור הוא , הזה המסך על שיוצאת המלכות חסרה , ג \" דבחי המסך על היוצאת , חכמה קומת אשר , ב \" כ באות ונתבאר .\" ק \" דא ב \" ע הבחינה חסר ב \" הע שפרצוף הרי . הכתר אור שהוא , מהאורות יחידה אור ובחינת דכלים , הזו הרחוקה הצורה שינוי ומשום . דעליון דאורות עליונה והבחינה , דעליון דכלים אחרונה . מהעליון נבדל לפרצוף התחתון נבחן 40) The difference between the lower and the higher Partzufim con- sists in the fact that each lower Partzuf appears at a different level, lower than the preceding one. As was mentioned, this level is deter- mined by the Aviut of Masach, consisting of the five Behinot."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 211 The highest level of the light and the lowest Behina of the Kelim of the previous Partzuf are absent in each subsequent one. The smaller the desire I use with the screen, the lower the quality of the light I receive in my Partzuf. The Impact between the Ohr Makif, and the Ohr Pnimi in the screen that separates them, contributes to the loss of the last Behina of the Aviut of this Masach. Therefore, Behina Dalet disappears in the Partzuf Galgalta, so that no Reshimot are left from it. After the Masach de Guf rises and merges with the Masach de Guf rises and mer ges with the Masach de Guf Masach de Peh making a Zivug de Haka’a on the Aviut left in the Reshimot of Masach , the Partzuf of one level lower emerges, i.e., the Partzuf of one lev el lo w er emer ges, i.e., the Partzuf Partzuf Hochma . The Behina Dalet of the vessels is absent in it as well as the light of Yechida . Because of the transformation of properties, a new Partzuf AB separates from the Partzuf Galgalta and becomes independent, but is considered its off- spring. If I can accept 20 per cent of five portions, it means that I receive the Ohr Yechida and the Behina Dalet . The next time a Partzuf is born with the smaller light of Haya and the Kli Gimel , then the OhrNeshama and the KliBet , then with the Ohr Ruach and the KliAleph , and the last one with the Ohr Nefesh and the Kli Shoresh . Then the desires recommence, and for 20 per cent of the remaining desires, the five Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are born, and so on, until all the desires of Malchut of the World of Infinity are used. All the Partzufim of the five worlds have received as much light as there was in Malchut of the World of Infinity, only gradually and with the help of the screen. No matter what portion we take as an example, it will al- ways consist of five parts, albeit very small. The Kli is created out of the five desires, and it is necessary to make a Zivug de Haka’a on each of them. If man has not yet corrected his Kelim , then the less egoism he has, the closer he is to the Creator. When he acquires the screen, then"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 212 the bigger his egoism is, the better, for the closer he is to the Creator. Everything depends on the presence of the screen. To make a Kli suitable for use, the light needs to enter it first, and then disappear, so that the Kli becomes completely remote from the Cre- ator. With further correction, it will be able to make a choice and merge with the Creator again. The exit into the spiritual world is possible only if there is a screen for all of your desires. However, if there are no desires, a Masach is not necessary either. Hence, without having desires, man cannot enter the spiritual world, since he has nothing to correct. The ascent to the spiritual levels goes in three lines: left, right and middle. By receiving new portions of egoism, man applies a stronger screen to them. A Zivug de Haka’a takes place between the screen and the light; as a result, man receives a new portion of the light and ascends to the next level. If man has big desires, while the strength of his resistance to them (the screen) is small, then he receives the light according to his screen and generates a small Partzuf. Then, when he is able to withstand a new portion of egoism, his Partzuf will expand on and on, until he receives a screen for absolutely all of his desires. This is called “Gmar Tikkun” . The “bigger” man is, the more de- sires he has, the stronger the screen he acquires; such a man has great at- tainments because he is able to rule over his coarsest desires. The desires are given to man from Above when he can ask for their correction. The scanty desires of our world, the Ner Dakik , turn our heads, oc- cupy our thoughts and have such command overus, that we do not know what to do with them, how to get rid of them. All our life is concerned with looking for an opportunity to fill these animal desires. Egoism itself must not be destroyed; one should only put two kinds of screen on it: first – to stop receiving for one’s own sake, then to start receiving for the sake of the Creator."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 213 A Zivug de Haka’a takes place in the Rosh , i.e., I calculate how much I can receive with the intention for the sake of the Creator. The calcula- tion is followed by the reception of the light into the Guf, from the Peh down to the Tabur . The Tabur is the borderline of the reception with the Tabur is the bor derline of the r ecep tion with the Tabur intention for the Creator’s sake. The light that the Kli was unable to re- ceive, the Ohr Makif , offers it to receive more; otherwise it does not fulfill Ohr Makif , of f er s it t o r eceiv e mor e; o ther wise it does no t fulf ill Ohr Makif the Purpose of creation. But the Kli knows that it cannot receive more for the sake of the Creator; provided it receives even a little bit more, this will already be for its own sake. There is no way out except to overcome this deadlocked state, i.e., expel all the received light. The Kli understands that, even if it can re- ceive in the future, it will not be the same amount as it has now, but smaller and with a weaker Masach . The Masach loses strength, rises to the Peh de Rosh together with the Reshimot it received from the four lights in the four Kelim . The Aviut Dalet was lost in the Tabur after the Tabur af t er the Tabur Bitush of the Ohr Makif in the Ohr Makif in the Ohr Makif Ma- sach ; therefore, the Kli will not be able to receive the Ohr Yechida hence- forth. However, it has not yet made the restriction on the remaining levels of the Aviut ; hence, it just does not know what it will or will not be able to receive. Now, when the Masach is at the Peh de Rosh , the Kli feels it can re- ceive some more light. Then all its Reshimot awake, and it tries to receive on the Behina Gimel . The Masach descends to the Chazeh , makes a Zivug de Haka’a there, and then a new Partzuf AB is born. However, all the Reshimot of AB come from the Guf of Guf of Guf Galgalta . What is the difference between the two notions: the screen and the Restriction, the Masach and the Tzimtzum ? A restriction means com- plete refusal to receive. The screen means reception of one part and pushing away the rest. Rabbi Baruch Ashlag gives the following example: each time a drunkard attended a wedding, he would drink himself to oblivion, fall down, and lay on the ground; even his wife would not let him into the house. Ashamed of his disgrace, the man decided to stop"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 214 attending weddings altogether, because he could not control himself. And so he commenced. After awhile, he decided he could be present at the festivities and allow himself to drink half a glass of wine, an amount that would not harm him. So he did. Conclusion: a restriction means to abstain from attending celebrations, while the screen means that one attends, but de- cides to receive a small amount. There are two kinds of Reshimot. The first is the Reshimo de Itlabshut , i.e., the memories of the pleasures I was filled with. The second kind is the Reshimo de Aviut. It is a recollection of the desires with the help of which I did that, and how strong and hard the screen I used was. The “desire to receive” in the Kli is created by the Creator. The Kli received the “desire to give” from Him. How can it use these absolutely opposite desires right now? First, the Kli measures the size of its “desire to give”, i.e., opposes its genuine, natural “desire to receive”. Let us assume that I have 20 per cent of the “desire to give”. It is called the hardness of the screen. I can resist my desire to receive plea- sure by 20 per cent. It means that in these 20 per cent I can receive the light, for in them I receive not for my own sake, but for the sake of the Creator. It is similar to a mother who receives pleasure when her baby is delighted. The Creator enjoys when I receive pleasure. The remaining desires, not included in these 20 per cent, remain empty; I do not work with them. What is Kabbalah? First, we take our inner desires, break them into small cells or vectors and build various graphs. This is the inner psychol- ogy of man; not as a creature of this world, but of some entity brought forth by the Creator with all the forces that the Creator gave to him. Then we study how, with the help of those forces, man attains the Creator. This is a brief explanation of what Kabbalah is. One should not see it as some mystical teaching about secret, supernatural forces that exist outside the Universe. The main idea of Kabbalah suggests that, in"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 215 the process of accumulating anti-egoistic forces, one can take a certain portion of egoism and work with it in a different direction. First, the screen that was at the Peh de Rosh did not want to receive anything, then it calculated how much it could receive for the sake of the Creator. It is a bigger effort than not receiving anything at all for one’s sake. As a result, the screen that is at the Peh de Rosh is divided into two screens. The first says that I do not want to receive anything for myself. It is a complete reflection of the light, its rejection, its observance of TA . The second screen, which is inactive so far, also stays there. After meet- ing the conditions of TA , I begin to try to receive a little bit of light for the sake of the Creator. דגוף המסך על מ \" דאו הביטוש ונעשה , וגוף לראש ב \" ע פרצוף שנתפשט אחר ז \" ועד ( מא של דעביות הרשימו את ממנו ומאביד מעלים הזה הביטוש הנה , ג \" דבחי מסך שהוא , ב \" דע בו ונכלל , דראש הפה אל המסך עלית בעת ונמצא . ג \" בחי שהוא , שבמסך האחרונה הבחינה נאבדה ג \" הבחי כי . הזה במסך שנשארה , ב \" דבחי עביות על רק ההכאה נעשה , דהכאה בהזווג פרצוף \" או \" ק \" דא ג \" דס ה \" הוי \" הנקרא , בינה בקומת ס \" ע רק מוציא הוא כ \" וע . ואינה ממנו הזה ג \" ס הפרצוף כשנתפשט ז \" ועד . דאורות יחידה וחיה דכלים ומלכות א \" ז ויחסר .\" ג \" ס הזה הביטוש הנה . ב \" דבחי מסך שהוא , שלו דגוף ּבהמסך מ \" דאו הביטוש ונעשה . וגוף לראש במסך נשארו ולא , ב \" בחי שהוא , שבהמסך דעביות אחרונה הבחינה ממנו ומאביד מעלים בזווג ונכלל , דראש לפה המסך עלית בעת , כ \" וע . ולמעלה א \" שמבחי דעביות הרשימות אלא נאבדה כבר ב \" הבחי כי . במסך שנשאר , א \" דבחי מסך על רק ההכאה נעשה , שם אשר דהכאה ומלכות א \" ז בינה חסר והוא .\" א \" ז קומת \" הנקרא , ת \" ת בקומת ס \" ע רק מוציא הוא כ \" וע . ממנו . ז \" עד ' וכו . דאורות יחידה חיה ונשמה , דכלים 41) After the formation of the Partzuf AB, the impact between the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Pnimi on the Masach de Guf of AB (with Aviut Gimel) takes place. This impact makes for the loss of the last Behina of the Reshimo de Masach. The Masach rises to the Peh de Rosh and makes a Zivug de Haka’a there only on the Aviut de Behina Bet. This Zivug forms the 10 Sefirot on the level of Bina, i.e., the Partzuf SAG of the world of Adam Kadmon, which has neither the Kelim of ZA and Malchut, nor the lights of Yechida and Haya."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 216 When the Partzuf SAG spreads into the Rosh and the Guf, it leads to a Bitush Ohr Makif on its Masach de Guf and the loss of the last Behina de Aviut of the Masach, the Behina Bet takes place. The Masach with the Reshimot de Aviut from the Behina Aleph and higher rises to the Peh de Rosh and makes a Zivug on the Behina Aleph there, which forms the 10 Sefirot on the level of Tifferet (or ZA). The Kelim Bina, ZA and Malchut and the lights Yechida, Haya and Neshama are absent in this Partzuf. Does the Behina Dalet in SAG have desires, or does it restrict them and the desires of the Behina Gimel ? Are there any desires in Behina Dalet in AB , or does it restrict them too? Everyone has these desires; we speak only about the “desire to re- ceive”, without which there is no creation. However, there was a danger that the souls might “steal”, receive for their own sake; hence, the correc- tion took place, making them unable to see anything. Now let us understand the saying, “All the earth is full of His Glory”, i.e., everyone has to feel His existence. Yet why can we not actu- ally feel it? It is because, from the direction of the Creator, “All the earth is full of His Glory”; but to prevent the creation from receiving for its own sake, the Restriction took place. Seeing no delight in it, man does not aspire after spirituality. The Introduction to “The Study of the Ten Sefirot” says that if punishment and reward were revealed so that the one who eats some- thing forbidden would instantly choke with it, who would dare to eat the forbidden food? On the contrary, if man felt great pleasure while putting on the Tzitzit (a ritual prayer shawl), he would never take it off. Therefore, if we felt the spiritual delight, we would immediately wish it for our own sake. There is only one law inherent in egoism: “To work less and to receive more”, it knows nothing else. So what can one do if one can"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 217 neither see nor receive anything? The Creator tells us: “I give everything freely and you should give freely”. We must reach the same level where we can give without expecting any reward. Hence, there was the Tikkun (correction) - we can neither see nor “steal”. It is written in the Gemara (Treatise “Sanhedrin”): “ Adam HaRishon was a thief” (he stole from the Creator). In the beginning there was the Creator’s domain, i.e., all that Adam HaRishon did was for the sake of bestowal; nothing for his own benefit. However, upon seeing the enormous light, he could not receive it with the intention for the sake of giving and got it for himself. This is called, that he takes the light from the Creator’s domain to his own; hence, he is called “a thief”. To prevent this from ever happening again, the correction took place in the souls; that is why they cannot see anything. Man should not ask for attainment and spiritual heights, only for the Kelim to be able to see. To give a name to the Partzuf there is no need to say that a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug some Behina takes place; it is enough to give its numeric value, the Gema- tria , to know what it is like qualitatively. Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey is the basis of any Kli. Malchut of the world of Infinity and the entire Universe consist of this one and only structure. The amount of matter on this structure, i.e., the use of a desire with the right intention is equal to the light received by the Partzuf . The Partzuf . The Partzuf numerical value speaks about the quantity and the quality of this light in the Partzuf. The Partzuf Galgalta corresponds to the entire Malchut of the World of Infinity and has the biggest screen in the Universe. If it received the maximum of what it could for the sake of the Creator, how can there be a place for another Partzuf ? What can Partzuf ? What can Partzuf AB add to what Galgalta has not yet received?"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 218 It turns out that AB also corresponds to Malchut of the World of Infinity, and it can receive the light that Galgalta could not. The screen in the next Partzuf is weaker; it interacts with the light of a different qual- ity, much less powerful than that of Galgalta ; hence, AB can receive an additional portion of the light. Each subsequent Partzuf receives the light of lower quality. Each new Partzuf is an absolutely new state. AB draws its desires from the Sof of Galgalta, i.e., it works with the desires that the previous Partzuf could not deal with. Galgalta wanted to receive the Ohr Yechida , whereas AB – only the Ohr Haya . When Malchut in the World of Infinity pushes away all the light, it is called Dalet de Aviut and Dalet de Hitlabshut . It shows that the Reshi- mot of the entire World of Infinity are in it. Galgalta starts working with these Reshimot , makes a Zivug de Haka’a on Dalet / Dalet and receives the corresponding light. When the Bitush Pnim u Makif takes place, the Bitush Pnim u Makif t ak es place, the Bitush Pnim u Makif Dalet de Hitlabshut and the Gimel de Aviut remain. Dalet de Aviut disappears because the Partzuf decides not to work with it anymore, and annuls it. Partzuf decides no t t o w or k with it an ymor e, and annuls it. Partzuf There is an inverse relation between the Kli and the light. The smaller the Kli , the closer it is in its properties to the light. Let us assume that I have five egoistic desires, from the purest to the coarsest. My purest desire is the nearest to the Creator, the coarsest one is the most remote. Malchut has five desires: Shoresh , Aleph , Bet , Gimel and Dalet. To put it more precisely, these are the five phases of development of one and the same “desire to receive”. The Shoresh is the purest, most elevated desire; therefore, it is the closest to the Creator. When Malchut puts the screen over its egoistic desire, the law that states that the purest desire is the closest to the Creator remains un- changed. Besides, the intention for the sake of the Creator is put on it, and exactly this intention allows it to receive more light than such a small desire was supposed to. Malchut with the Masach “attracts” the light, but Keter (the purest, loftiest part of the Kli ) receives it and not Malchut."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 219 The main elements of the Universe are: -the light emanating directly from the Creator; -the egoistic “desire to receive” delight that was created by Him; -the screen that emerged as a reaction to the received light. Kabbalah studies these elements in their various states. Harmoni- ous correspondence between the screen, the light, and the desire con- stitutes the soul, which dictates its laws to the angels, the Levushim and material objects. Each Partzuf fills Malchut of the World of Infinity; thus the Partzu- fim cover its innermost point from the light. We are the central point. Therefore, as regards us, all the worlds, all the Partzufim are the restrain- ing screens. On the one hand, we say that all the worlds were created in de- scending order, i.e., before the existence of man. The Worlds are the measures of concealment of the Creator. Galgalta conceals the Creator from the lower Partzuf by 20 per cent. Partzuf b y 20 per cent. Partzuf AB only sees 80% of the Creator. Nevertheless, these 80 % are the Creator for it, so they are in fact 100 % for AB . Thus, it goes until the five worlds that consist of the five Partzu- fim , where each Partzuf in turn consists of five Sefirot , completely con- ceal the Creator’s light from us behind 125 screens. The light does not reach our world at all. We are behind the screen and can neither see nor feel the Creator. On the other hand, as man ascends and reaches the level of some Partzuf, he puts up the screen equal to this Partzuf and by doing so elimi- Partzuf and b y doing so elimi- Partzuf nates the concealment of the Creator on this level. Rising to the next level, man neutralizes its concealment with the help of his screen, attains the Creator on this level et cetera. When he annuls all the filters, he will completely grasp all the levels that separate him from the Creator. The worlds are created to teach us how to act in each situation. Therefore, the Creator’s concealment is descending, while the revelation"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 220 happens in the opposite direction. The steps, which the soul climbs, as it were, disappear thereupon. The lower Partzuf knows the previous one and understands that it cannot receive as much light as the one before it does. However, to provide the lower Partzuf with the light, each higher one should send its request for the light (called MAN ) to the Partzuf above it. Since each new Partzuf is an absolutely new desire, which after TA has never been filled with the light, each new Partzuf leads to a new attainment, exceeding the previous one both qualitatively and quanti- tatively. The light received by each subsequent Partzuf arrives to it via the previous one. All the Partzufim it passes through, receive their part of the light, and this portion is immeasurably bigger than the amount of the light that will be received by the last one in this chain. Only Galgalta receives the light directly from the World of Infinity. All our actions are based on our desires. The mind plays only an auxiliary role at that. The mind consciously perceives only what enters the senses; it calculates and analyses them. The wider and deeper the sensations are, the bigger the mind necessary for their processing. If we take a person who studies Kabbalah and indulges in some kind of inner work, then the more subtle this work is, the more flexible and precise his mind should be to differentiate and analyze his senses and make adequate conclusions. However, the mind always remains only an auxiliary tool of the desire. The mind is needed only for gaining the desired object. All of us want pleasure, and the mind assists us in achiev- ing it. If man wants to enjoy scientific research, his mind helps him there. Man thinks that he lives only by his mind; therefore, he stands above all other creatures. זה הפרצופים השתלשלות בעת מזו למטה זו הקומות ירידות של הטעם היטב ונתבאר ( מב הבחינה את שם תמיד מאביד , פרצוף בכל הנוהג , פ \" באו מ \" דאו שהביטוש משום שהוא , מזה . שם אשר דעביות דרשימו אחרונה"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 221 . א : בחינות ' ב בהם יש , הזדככותו לאחר במסך הנשארות , הרשימות שבאלו אמנם , לדעת ויש דפרצוף דגוף המסך שנזדכך אחר , למשל . דהתלבשות רשימו נקרא . ב , דעביות רשימו נקרא נאבדה , ד \" דבחי הרשימו שהיא , דעביות דרשימות האחרונה שהבחינה אמרנו , ק \" דא ' הא ' ב כוללת ד \" דבחי הרשימו אמנם . ג \" דבחי דעביות הרשימו אלא , בהמסך נשאר ולא . ממנו הרשימו רק ההיא ההזדככות בסבת מהמסך נאבד ולא . ודעביות דהתלבשות : ל \" כנ בחינות . ממנו נאבד ולא ההוא בהמסך נשארה ד \" דבחי דהתלבשות הרשימו אבל . ד \" דבחי דעביות עביות בה שאין , ד \" דבחי מהרשימו מאד זכה בחינה הוא , דהתלבשות הרשימו של ופירושו פרצוף שבכל אחרונה מהבחינה נשארה זו ורשימו . העליון אור עם דהכאה לזווג מספיק רק הוא , הזדככותו בעת פרצוף מכל נאבדה אחרונה שהבחינה , שאמרנו ומה . הזדככותו בעת . בלבד שבה דעביות הרשימו 42) Now we will understand the meaning of the consecutive descent of the levels during the development of the Partzufim one after an- other because of the Bitush Ohr Makif and Ohr Pnimi, which gov- erns in each Partzuf and contributes to the loss of its last Behina of the Reshimo de Aviut. The Reshimot left after the thinning of the screen are of two kinds: the Reshimo de Aviut and the Reshimo de Hitlabshut. Therefore, after the weakening of the Masach of the Partzuf Galgalta, the Reshimo de Aviut of the Behina Gimel remained, while the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of the Behina Dalet did not change. The Reshimo de Hitlabshut is a very thin part of the Reshimo that does not have sufficient Aviut for a Zivug de Haka’a with the light. Like Galgalta , any Partzuf with the weakening of its Masach loses only the last Reshimo de Aviut , but not the Reshimo de Hitlabshut . We have studied that there is an inverse relation between the light and the vessel, and there are two rules here: 1) “Lefum Tza’ara – Agra” , i.e., the reward is given according to the merit (suffering); in other words, the amount of the light revealed to man depends on the amount of efforts he made. 2) The light wants to enter the clearest Kli . The Kli is considered clear if it refuses to receive anything the coarse Kli wants to receive."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 222 For example, it is easier to work with the intention for the sake of bestowal during prayer, when man is covered with a Tallit , and crowned with a Tefillin; he does not want to receive anything, only to fulfill the commandment. But while studying, it is more difficult to have the inten- tion for the sake of bestowal, much more difficult to have it during the family meal, and still more difficult to apply during one’s work. However, according to the first rule, the bigger hindrances one can overcome, the more powerful light one can receive. That is why if man can do business with the intention for the sake of the Creator, without doubt he is worthy of a high level. We say about such person that “His knowledge is deep and his prayer is strong!” The second rule springs from the first one: the highest level cor- responds to the lightest Kelim, although there it is easier to intend for the sake of the Creator. On the other hand, the height of the level is determined by its most corrected property, and the light goes through it and descends to the lower level. Therefore, the Reshimo de Aviut is a deficiency, the “desire to re- ceive”. But one should not forget that, in spirituality, the “desire to re- ceive” always means the desire with a Masach . Therefore the Reshimo de Aviut means that there is a memory in it of how much it can receive for the sake of giving, i.e., the previous strength of resistance disappeared in it. Its lightest Kli, the Kli de Keter , cannot disappear under the influence of the surrounding light, because it has no Aviut . Hence, Reshimo of the light that was there once is left in it, which is called the Reshimo de Hitlab- shut. There is always some Reshimo left from the presence of the light. Two notions should be cleared up: 1) The light comes from the giver’s direction. 2) The Aviut and the Masach come from the receiver’s direction. Whatever comes from the giver leaves a memory, and whatever comes from the receiver – meets with resistance and disappears."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 223 Rabbi Baruch Ashlag gives the following example: “Once I found myself in a place where old people were resting. I looked around and saw that all of them were dozing, paying no attention to anything. It is said about it: “the day is devoid of passion”. I came up to one of them and began talking to him. First I asked him where he was from, then how he made his living, so I got him talking, and he began telling me about his past businesses. Little by little, he was getting more and more excited and enthusi- astic, recalling his achievements and the various events he went through, i.e., in the language of Kabbalah the Reshimot of the past delights awoke in him. At the end, I asked him, “Would you like to relive it all over again, traveling from town to town making deals and striking bargains the way you did before? That very instant his eyes grew dim, for he re- called the present and the bygone strength, which he had no more”. Thus, we see that the Reshimo of a man’s delight remains in him, while the strength is all gone. We may conclude that he has no more Aviut in him, i.e., he cannot receive for the sake of giving. The Reshimo de Hitlab- shut – the reminiscence of the pleasure dressed in the Kli -desire remained, but, having no screen, he is unable to return to the bygone delights. ליציאת גרם , מסך בכל שנשארה , אחרונה מהבחינה דהתלבשות הרשימו של וההשארה ( מג ה \" במ וכן , ק \" דא ג \" בס וכן , ק \" דא ב \" מע החל . הפרצופים דכל בראשים ונקבה זכר קומות ' ב . אצילות פרצופי ובכל , ק \" דא ן \" וב בקומת ס \" ע המוציא , ג \" דבחי דעביות רשימו אלא במסך שם שאין , ק \" דא ב \" ע בפרצוף כי עם לזווג כלל ראויה שאינה , במסך שם הנשארת , ד \" מבחי דהתלבשות הרשימו הנה , חכמה ואז . אחת לרשימו ונעשת ג \" דבחי העביות עם נכללת היא הנה , זכותה משום העליון אור . העליון אור עם להזדווגות כח דהתלבשות הרשימו קנתה , מטעם והוא . כתר לקומת בקירוב ס \" ע המוציא , העליון אור עם דהכאה זווג עליה יצא כ \" וע הרשימו כי . בזכר הנקבה התכללות נקרא זה והתכללות . ד \" דבחי התלבשות בחינת בה היות ד \" דבחי דהתלבשות והרשימו . העביות לבחינת הנושא להיותה , נקבה נקרא ג \" מבחי דעוביות . מעביות זך שהוא ומשום , ממנה גבוה מקומה שבא משום , זכר נקרא , בו הנקבה התכללות י \" ע אמנם , דהכאה לזווג מספיק אינו בלבד דזכר שהרשימו הגם , ולפיכך . דהכאה לזווג ראוי הוא גם נעשה"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 224 43) The disappearance of the Reshimo de Hitlabshut in each last level left in the Masach leads to the formation of two stages: Zachar and Nekeva (“male” and “female” essence) in the Rosh of each Partz- uf, starting from AB de AK, but also in SAG, MA, BON and in all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. There is the Reshimo de Aviut of the Behina Gimel in the screen of the Partzuf AB. It elevates the 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light only up to the level of Hochma, but the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of the Be- hina Dalet that is left there is unfit for Zivug with the Upper Light, due to its Zakut (the absence of the “desire to receive”, but wishing to be like the Creator). By absorbing the Reshimo de Aviut and forming one common Reshimo with it, it now receives enough strength for a Zivug de Haka’a with the Upper Light. Then a Zivug de Haka’a with the Ohr Elion takes place, and as a result, the Partzuf of the level close to that of Keter emerges, as the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of the Behina Dalet is present in it. This merging is called the inclusion of Nekeva in Zachar; since the Reshimo de Aviut of the Behina Gimel is called “Nekeva”. This is because it is determined by the property of Aviut (the sensation of the “desire to receive”). However, the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of the Behina Dalet is called Zachar, because it corresponds to a higher state and does not have Aviut. The Reshimo de Zachar cannot make a Zivug by itself. A Zivug de Nekeva determines the level of the emerging Partzuf, the quality and the quantity of the light that will really enter the Partzuf. Owing to the memory of its previous state, i.e., the previous Partz- uf, Zivug de Zachar gives to the emerging uf, Zivug de Zachar giv es t o the emer ging uf, Zivug de Zachar Partzuf a kind of additional, Partzuf a kind of additional, Partzuf auxiliary luminescence. Such interaction of Zachar and Nekeva starts from the Partzuf AB . Therefore beginning with it, all the Partzufim have two heads ( Rashim ) and two Zivugim ."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 225 There is a rule: regarding the lower level, the upper one is called perfection ( Shlemut ). Zachar is called perfection because it is the Zachar is called per f ection because it is the Zachar Reshimo of the light and there is no deficiency in it. בהרשימו נכלל דהתלבשות שהרשימו דהיינו . בנקבה הזכר התכללות גם יש זה ואחר ( מד קומת שהיא , ג \" בחי קומת רק שהוא , בלבד הנקבה קומת על דהכאה זווג יוצא ואז . דעביות .\" ב \" דע ה \" הוי \" הנקרא , חכמה וזווג . בקירוב כתר קומת שהיא , הזכר לקומת נבחן , בהזכר נכללה שהנקבה , העליון הזווג והנה קומת אמנם . בלבדה חכמה קומת שהיא , הנקבה לקומת נבחן , בהנקבה נכלל שהזכר , התחתון שמספיק הגם הנה , הנקבה עם התכללות י \" ע אלא , מעצמו אינו שבו שהעביות מתוך , הזכר ממעלה להתפשט יכולה זו קומה אין ז \" עכ ,\" ראש \" הנקרא , למעלה ממטה ס \" ע קומת ליציאת . בכלים האורות התלבשות שפירושו , גוף לבחינת למטה . כלים לבחינת להתפשט מספיק אינו , התכללות מבחינת הבא עביות על דהכאה זווג כי , הנקבה מקומת רק נמשך הפרצוף וגוף . גוף בלי ראש בחינת רק הזכר בקומת אין ולפיכך הנקבה קומת על רק הפרצוף את מכנים אנו זה ומשום . עצמותו מבחינת עביות לה שיש התלבשות שהוא , שלו גוף הבחינת הוא הפרצוף של עיקרו כי . ב \" ע פרצוף בשם דהיינו , בלבד . שמה על הפרצוף נקרא כ \" ע . כמבואר הנקבה מקומת רק יוצא והוא . בכלים האורות 44) There is also the inclusion of Zachar in Nekeva. This means that the Reshimo de Hitlabshut unites with the Reshimo de Aviut. In this case a Zivug occurs only on the level of Nekeva, i.e., on Behina Gimel (Hochma), which is called HaVaYaH (Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey, the unutterable Name of the Creator) de AB. There are the so-called “upper” and “lower” Zivugim. The upper Zi- vug corresponds to the inclusion of Nekeva in Zachar. Because of this Zivug, the Partzuf whose level is close to Keter emerges. The lower Zivug corresponds to the inclusion of Zachar in Nekeva. This Zivug leads to the creation of a Partzuf whose level is only Hochma. Aviut, which corresponds to the level of Zachar, does not belong to it, as was mentioned above; it was acquired because of the “inclusion”, the interaction with Nekeva. Therefore this Aviut is sufficient only for creating the 10 Sefirot bot- tom-up (called Rosh), but not for spreading top-down, which forms the Guf – the true vessels.

Hence, we call the Partzuf according to the level of Nekeva, in this particular case AB. The main part of the Partzuf is the Guf; it is where the reception of the light in the vessels takes place. יוצאים דרך אותו על ממש , ב \" ע דפרצוף בראש ונקבה זכר הקומות ' ב שנתבארו ד \" וע ( מה שהוא משום , חכמה לבחינת בקירוב הוא הזכר קומת שם אלא . ג \" הס בראש גם הללו ' ב , בינה בקומת היא הנקבה וקומת . ב \" דבחי העביות בהתכללות ג \" דבחי דהתלבשות מהרשימו . ב \" דבחי מהעביות דהיינו ז \" ועד . גוף בלי ראש הוא שהזכר משום , הנקבה קומת שם על רק הפרצוף נקרא כאן וגם ,\" ת \" ישסו קומת \" המכונה , בינה לקומת בקירוב הוא הזכר קומת ושם . ק \" דא ה \" מ בפרצוף א \" ז קומת היא הנקבה וקומת . א \" מבחי עביות בהתכללות דהתלבשות ב \" דבחי מרשימו להיותו פרצוף דהיינו , הנקבה שם על אלא נקרא הפרצוף אין כאן וגם . דעביות א \" בחי רק היא כי . לבד . הפרצופים בכל תשכיל ז \" ועד . גוף בלי ראש הוא שהזכר משום , ק \" ו פרצוף או ה \" מ 45) Similar to the formation of the two levels of Zachar and Nekeva in the Rosh of the Partzuf AB, the same levels emerge in the Partzuf SAG. The only difference is that, in the former case, the level of Zachar is approximately Hochma, since it emerges as a result of a Zivug on the inclusion of Aviut Bet (Bina) in the Reshimo Gimel de Hitlabshut (Hochma). The level of Nekeva in SAG is a pure Bina with Aviut Bet. In the case of SAG, the Partzuf is also called according to the level of Nekeva (Bina), since the level of Zachar has only the Rosh without the Guf. Zachar of the Partzuf MA of the world AK is at the level close to Bina and is called YESHSUT, since it results from the in- teraction between the Reshimo Bet de Hitlabshut and the Reshimo Aleph de Aviut. Nekeva of this Partzuf is at the level of ZA, since it has only Aleph de Aviut. The rest of the Partzufim of the world AK are constructed similarly. VAK de Bina is called YESHSUT, and Gar de Bina is called the upper Abba ve Ima."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 227 T A’ A M I M , N E K U D O T , T A G I N , A N D O T I O T ואותיות תגין נקודות טעמים , גוף לבחינת הפרצוף התפשטות אחר הנוהג , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש שנתבאר אחר ( מו הנשארים הרשימות עם והמסך , מסתלקים דגוף האורות וכל , דגוף המסך מזדכך שבסבתו בשיעור חדשה קומה ומוציאים , מחדש דהכאה בזווג שם ומתחדשים , דראש לפה עולים בו ועליות מ \" דאו הביטוש עם הנעשים , א \" טנת אורות מיני ' ד עתה נבאר , שברשימות העביות . דראש לפה המסך 46) We said above that because of the Bitush Ohr Makif in the Masach de Guf, the Masach weakens, rises until it joins the Ma- sach de Rosh, and becomes a single whole with it. Then both screens perform a Zivug de Haka’a, which leads to the emergence of a new Partzuf in concordance with the Aviut in its Reshimot. Now let us study the four kinds of the light TANTA (Ta’amim, Nekudot, Tagin and Otiot – in Hebrew the word begins with the letter Aleph), which stem out of the Bitush de Ohr Makif and the rise of the Masach to the Peh de Rosh. שנזדכך עד , דגוף עביות מכל למסך מזכך הוא , דגוף במסך מ \" דאו הביטוש י \" שע , נתבאר כי ( מז אחת כבחינה מיחדהו נמצא , דראש הפה עם הצורה שהשתוות . דראש דפה למסך ונשתוה סדר פי על אלא , אחת בבת מזדכך המסך שאין , נבחן אמנם . שבו דהכאה בזווג ונכלל , עמו , א \" לבחי ב \" מבחי כ \" ואח , ב \" לבחי ג \" מבחי כ \" ואח , ג \" לבחי ד \" מבחי מתחילה , דהיינו . המדרגה דפה המסך כמו זך ונעשה עביותו בחינת מכל שנזדכך עד , שורש לבחינת א \" מבחי כך ואחר ומצב מצב בכל המסך עם מזדווג והוא , רגע אף מלהאיר פוסק אינו העליון אור והנה . דראש . הזדככותו של 47) However, the Masach does not lose its strength at one go; it hap- pens in a certain order. First, the Masach loses Behina Dalet, then Behina Gimel, then Bet, then Shoresh and Aleph, until the Masach is totally free from all the Aviut and merges with the Masach de Rosh. The Upper Light never stops shining; it continues to interact with the Masach in whatever state it may be during the process of its weakening."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 228 The egoistic desire that made TA now wants to work only in an al- truistic mode and enjoy receiving for the sake of the Creator. However, at the beginning it receives only 20 per cent, then gradually gets free from the light, because it cannot receive any more as the result of the Bitush of the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Makif Ohr Pnimi . In fact, the light neither enters nor exits anything. The light is constantly inside the vessel (the Kli) . Everything depends on whether the particular vessel is able to feel the light inside it or not. Similarly, we are filled with the Creator’s light, but do not feel it due to the lack of correc- tion, the screen. If we begin to correct ourselves and acquire the screen against our egoism, we will feel the Creator and His light. Now that the decision to expel the light is made, Malchut , wishing to feel and reveal the Creator, starts modifying its inner sensations. The Upper Light never stops shining, but constantly makes Zivugim with the Masach in each state as it ascends. When the Masach de Guf ascended one level above the Tabur, i.e., from the Malchut de Guf to the Zeir Anpin de Guf, there was an intermediate Zivug in the Masach de Rosh. Because of this Zivug, the intermediate Partzuf of the level of Hochma emerged. Then the Masach de Guf continues to rise. From ZA de Guf it rises to Bina de Guf. At this time, there is another intermediate Zivug de Haka’a on the Masach de Rosh, which leads to the formation of the Partzuf of the level of Bina and so on. There are four such interim Zivugim during the transition from Gal- galta to AB. These Zivugim lead to the formation of four intermedi- ate Partzufim called Hochma de Galgalta, Bina de Galgalta, ZA de Galgalta, and Malchut de Galgalta. Thus, we learned that the second Partzuf AB is born with the help of four Zivugim, which gradually emerge during the weakening of the Masach de Guf on its way to complete merging with the Masach de"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 229 Rosh. A similar process takes place during the transition from AB to SAG or any other Partzuf. There is a general rule: the Masach cannot get free from its Aviut at one go; it is a gradual process. The Ohr Elion, which is constantly shining, makes a Zivug on each level. אור הרי , ג \" דבחי לעביות בא והמסך , הזו כתר הקומת כל ונסתלק , ד \" מבחי שנזדכך אחר כי . חכמה בקומת ס \" ע ומוציא , בו הנשארת ג \" דבחי העביות פי על המסך עם מזדווג העליון בחינה רק במסך נשאר ולא , חכמה קומת גם ונסתלק , ג \" מבחי גם המסך כשנזדכך , כך ואחר גם כשמזדכך כך ואחר . בינה בקומת ס \" ע ומוציא , ב \" בחי על עמו מזדווג העליון אור נמצא ,' ב עם מזדווג העליון אור הנה , א \" דבחי עביות רק בו נשאר ולא , הזו הקומה ונסתלקה , ב \" מבחי מעביות גם וכשנזדכך . א \" הז בקומת ס \" ע קומת ומוציא , בו הנשארת א \" דבחי עוביות על המסך על גם העליון אור מזדווג , העביות שורש אלא בו נשאר ולא , מסתלקת א \" הז וקומת , א \" דבחי מעביות גם המסך וכשנזדכך . המלכות בקומת ס \" ע ומוציא , בהמסך הנשארת דשורש העביות אז הנה , דגוף עביות שום עוד במסך נשאר לא כי , משם נסתלקה המלכות קומת וגם , דשורש ויוצאים , דהכאה בזווג שם ונכלל , דראש המסך עם ונתחברו עלו ורשימותיו שהמסך נבחן . הראשון לפרצוף ותולדה בן הנקראות , החדשות ס \" הע עליו , ק \" דא ' הא הפרצוף של דגוף להמסך המזכך , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש שענין , נתבאר והנה , אחת בבת נעשה זה אין , ק \" דא ב \" ע שני פרצוף ויוצא נולד ז \" שעי , שלו דראש לפה ומעלהו ובא שהולך , מדרגות ' מהד ומצב מצב בכל עמו מזדווג עליון אור אשר , המדרגה סדר על אלא במשך קומות ' ד יציאת שנתבאר ז \" ועד . דראש לפה שנשתווה עד , הזדככותו זמן במשך עליהם דגוף המסך הזדככות זמן במשך קומות ' ג יוצאות כן , ב \" ע לצורך ' א דפרצוף הגוף הזדככות זמן . המדרגות בכל וכן . ג \" ס לפרצוף אצילותו בעת , ב \" ע דפרצוף פוסק שאינו , העליון ואור . המדרגה בסדר אלא אחת בבת מזדכך המסך אין : הכלל זה כי . זיכוכו שבדרך ומדרגה מדרגה בכל עמו מזדווג נמצא , לתחתון להתפשט אינן , המדרגה סדר פ \" ע הזדככותו זמן במשך המסך על שיוצאות הקומות אלו אמנם ( מח התחלת מטרם שיצאה הראשונה הקומה כמו , אמיתיות מדרגות להתפשטות נחשבות של הדין כח כי .\" ודין ח \" או \" בשם ומכונות . נקודות לבחינות נחשבות שהן אלא , הזדככות . בהם מעורב כבר האורות הסתלקות נחשב הנה , ד \" מבחי דגוף המסך את וזיכך לפעול התחיל כשהביטוש תיכף הנה ,' הא בפרצוף כי . כולו להזדכך מוכרח כבר , להזדכך שהתחיל וכיון . ברוחני מקצת אין כי . כולו נזדכך כבר כאלו בכל עמו להזדווג העליון לאור שהות יש , המדרגה סדר על להזדכך המסך שמדרך מתוך אלא הקומות אלו כ \" וע . כולו שמזדכך עד , הזדככותו זמן במשך מקבל שהמסך עביות של מדרגה נקודות לבחינות רק ונחשבות , בהן מעורב ההסתלקות כח , הסתלקותו זמן במשך היוצאות . ודין ח \" ואו"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 230 48) These interim, inner Partzufim are called “Nekudot”. Nekudot are the Ohr Hozer, per se. Besides, the Nekudot are inseparably con- nected with the category of “Din” (judgment), because the force of this judgment-restriction is already included in them. There are no half-decisions in spirituality. Therefore, when the Partz- uf, affected by a Bitush Pnim u Makif, decides to expel the light, this process cannot be stopped. However, as was said above, during the expulsion of the light, i.e., during the ascent of the Masach from the Tabur (Malchut de Guf), intermediate Zivugim de Haka’a take place and create intermediate Partzufim called Nekudot. Any reception of the light inside the Partzuf (including what oc- curred because of such a Zivug ) is a reception of pleasure. It means that, Zivug ) is a r ecep tion of pleasur e. It means that, Zivug even while passing from one level to another lower one (e.g. from Gal- galta to AB , from AB to SAG and so on), the Partzuf continues to receive the light (pleasure). שיצאו דגוף ס \" הע כי . ונקודות , טעמים : בשם , קומות מיני ' ב פרצוף בכל מבחינים אנו ולפיכך , זיכוכו בדרך בפרצוף היוצאות הקומות ואותם .\" טעמים \" בשם נקראות פרצוף בכל בראשונה .\" נקודות \" בשם נקראות הן , דראש לפה שמגיע עד להזדכך המסך התחיל שכבר אחר דהיינו Thus, we can distinguish two levels in each Partzuf: the Ta’amim and the Nekudot. The Nekudot were defined above. The Ta’amim are the first 10 Sefirot de Guf of the Partzuf, emerging because of the first regular Zivug de Haka’a, which leads to the formation of this particular Partzuf. The first spreading of the light – the Ta’amim - came to shine on this level; but the Nekudot , although they have the Direct Light and also spread in the form of Rosh , Toch and Sof , do not emerge to shine on this Sof , do no t emer ge t o shine on this Sof level because the Ohr Makif annuls the screen and the entire level disap- Ohr Makif annuls the scr een and the entir e lev el disap- Ohr Makif pears. However, since the screen consists of the four Behinot , the light cannot leave the level at one go. It resembles a situation in which a per- son sitting in the fourth room is asked to leave. He cannot leave the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 231 house from the fourth room without passing through the other three. When he enters the third room, he does not intend to remain there, for he wishes only to pass through it. A person falling down from the fifth floor cannot stop during the fall, can he? He must fall down to the fourth floor, then to the third and so on, until he reaches the ground. A clever person falling down from the fifth level considers the fourth level the lowest; in this case, he can stop immediately and must not continue falling. Someone less smart, falling from the fifth level to the fourth one, thinks: “There are people worse than I am”. This person must fall to the bottom. There is another example. Two workers received their salary. The first one got $800 and is very pleased; the second got $900 and is very sad. The first one used to receive $600 before; hence, he was pleased to receive $800. The second one used to receive $1000, so he was sad when his salary was cut. The reduced salary brings no pleasure, only judgment and restriction. It is defined as “the power of judgment”, the power of outcome, which arises from the disappearance of the screen and according to the law that imposes a ban on the egoistic reception. These phases of the light's withdrawal are called “the Returned Light”. Yet in fact, they are the Direct Light since they shine at the time of departure, during “the return of the light to its root”. Since there are no half-decisions in the spiritual world, we may conclude that, if we wish to attain spirituality, we should prefer it to everything else and go on until the end. בשם נקראות , דטעמים האורות הסתלקות אחר בגוף למטה הנשארות הרשימות ואלו ( מט .\" כלים \" שהם ,\" אותיות \" בשם נקראות הנקודות מקומות הנשארות הרשימות ואלו .\" תגין \" ומקיימים , והכלים האותיות על חופפים הם , דטעמים מהאורות הרשימות שהם , והתגין . אותם הקומה אשר .\" אותיות \" ,\" תגין \" ,\" נקודות \" ,\" טעמים \" הנקראים , אורות מיני ' ד ונתבאר ,\" ן \" ב \" \" ה \" מ \" ,\" ג \" ס \" ,\" ב \" ע \" ,\" גלגלתא \" הנקראים , פ \" מה פרצוף בכל היוצאת הראשונה שמזדכך עד , להזדכך התחיל שכבר אחר פרצוף בכל היוצאות וקומות .\" טעמים \" בשם נקראת"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 232 אחר קומה שבכל דטעמים מהאורות הנשארות והרשימות .\" נקודות \" בשם נקראות , כולו אחר הנקודות קומות של מהאורות הנשארות והרשימות .\" תגין \" בשם נקראות , הסתלקותם ,\" גלגלתא \" הנקראים פ \" ה בכל זה ותזכור .\" כלים \" או \" אותיות \" בשם נקראות , הסתלקותם . אורות מיני ' ד אלו יש ובכולם הזדככות יש בכולם כי ,\" ן \" ב \" ,\" ה \" מ \" ,\" ג \" ס \" ,\" ב \" ע \" 49) The Reshimot (memories) that remain from the Ta’amim in the Guf of the Partzuf are called “Tagin”. The Reshimot that remain from the interim stages of Nekudot are called “Otiot” or “Kelim”. The Tagin (Reshimot from the lights of Ta’amim) are placed above the letters (Otiot - the genuine Kelim), and enliven them. Therefore, the ten Sefirot that emerged from the first Zivug de Haka’a and the subsequent descent of the light are called the “Ta’amim”. The ten Sefirot or, rather, ten interim Partzufim (or five, if we consider ZA one Sefira), which emerged from the nine (or four) intermediate Zivugim during the rise of the screen from the Tabur to the Peh, are called “Nekudot”. The Reshimot of Ta’amim are called “Tagin” and the Reshimot of Nekudot – “Otiot”. Nothing ever appears or disappears; everything depends on the at- titude of the Partzuf to the light. It either perceives the light as pleasure or as darkness. Malchut of the World of Infinity sensed the light as egoistic pleasure, and then saw emptiness in it. Therefore, it disappeared (in the language of Kabbalah, Malchut “expelled” the light). Now it does not derive pleasure from egoistic reception, but from receiving for the sake of bestowal. The filling of it from the Peh to the Tabur is the sensation of pleasure from giving to the Creator. Being too weak to keep this pleasure, Malchut loses the desire for it, and it leaves. However, the reminiscence of this pleasure stays behind; it is called the Reshimo , i.e., the outside light, as it were, shines from afar upon this Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf In fact, all sensations are inside; so the meaning of “outside” is purely relative. There are dozens of kinds of Reshimot (memories) and of course, all of them are felt inside. The Ohr Makif (the Surrounding, Outer Ohr Makif ( t h e S u r r o u n d i n g , O u t e r Ohr Makif"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 233 Light) is inside me, but the attitude to it is different now. We must learn to think internally, turning all our attention and thoughts “inside”. Being empty of pleasure creates the Kelim. Man had already expe- rienced the previous state, passed it, and sensed all its transformations. Now, he can proceed to the next. Without the state of being filled and the following emptiness, it is impossible to acquire a genuine Kli. Longing for spirituality or being indifferent to it, striving after ani- mal pleasures – only this determines man’s advancement. It does not de- pend on us how many levels we will go through. We can only determine the speed. This means that man can shorten the duration of the correc- tion (“Israel shortens the time”). This is the main task of Kabbalah. It turns out that the Ta’amim , i.e., the spreading of the light from above, only marks the contours of the future Partzuf. It is only Keter , the sketch of the future ten Sefirot . The Nekudot are the ten Sefirot that already appear according to the contours outlined by the Ta’amim . The Nekudot are the next stage of the creation of the Partzuf , the Partzuf , the Partzuf Kli . The Tagin are the ten Sefirot that were also placed on the borders created earlier by the Ta’amim and the Nekudot . The Otiot are the ten Sefirot that appeared after the expulsion of the light. Otiot , i.e., the state where there is no light, but there is a very strong “desire to receive” it, are the very final phase in the development of the Kli. One must remember that well, because the weakening of the screen, the expulsion of the light and the emergence of four kinds of the light, Ta’amim , Nekudot , Tagin and Otiot, take place in all the Partzufim . The light enters or exits the Kli , but the Reshimot are also the light that shines with small intensity, as it cannot be retained anymore. When man ascends the spiritual levels, all these Reshimot are al- ready inside him. He knows in advance that there will be difficulties; hence, foreseeing a fall, he can use it as a springboard for a future as- cent. By working, putting his efforts into something, man is rewarded"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 234 with knowledge and pleasant sensations. The moment he starts enjoying them, there comes a fall. Nevertheless, while man is descending, he cannot feel the fall yet; it still pleases him. When he feels it, it means that he is already down. Therefore, to avoid the sensation of a fall, to sweeten its bitterness, man, when he achieves something good, should consider it a fall. Then he can continue ascending. This refers to the practical studies of Kabbalah. The answers to the questions that come to one’s mind during the study of the material should be attained internally. If man starts feeling the Creator just a little bit, then the questions he used to ask others are revealed to him. Only by receiving a personal answer to his question, by attracting a spark of the light, does he discover the essence of phenom- ena, and it is never forgotten; it remains inside him, in his sensations. Such answers depend on the amount of effort man puts forth and have nothing to do with the bulk of his accumulated knowledge. Nor does it depend on his educational level or intellect. This is the main difference between Kabbalah and all other sciences. Kabbalah is called a science because it is based on the reception of the spiritual light – the Ohr Hochma , which enters the spiritual Kli with the help of the screen, but not through knowledge or intellect. Spiritual knowledge is the light that enters the Kli , the desire to receive pleasure for the sake of the Creator. All other kinds of knowledge enter our 'desire to acquire'; the knowledge itself constitutes egoistic in- formation. The discovery of spirituality means that one should not seek knowl- edge; rather one must be eager to acquire the intention to receive for the sake of the Creator. Spiritual information must enter the spiritual vessel. While studying, I should connect with the material; find something that speaks about me. I have to understand where my past, present and future are, and how they are related to the material I study. If man has not yet"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 235 entered the spiritual world, it means that the quality and the quantity of his efforts were not sufficient. Or, perhaps man has made considerable effort; but their quality was not adequate enough, i.e., during his studies he did not concentrate on how the Upper Light would purify and elevate him above our world. Instead, he tried to understand the material and fill his mind with it."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 236 R O S H , T O C H , S O F , A N D D R E S S I N G O F T H E PA R T Z U F I M O N O N E A N O T H E R פרצוף שבכל ס \" רת ענין ז \" זב הפרצופים התלבשות סדר ו ומלכות המזדווגת מלכות שהם , פרצוף בכל מלכיות מיני ' ב שיש ההבחן את ידעת כבר הנה ( נ המלבישות , ולמעלה ממנה ח \" דאו ס \" ע יוצאות המזדווגת שבמלכות מהמסך והנה . המסיימת . לבד שרשים כלומר ,\" דראש ס \" ע \" נקראות שהם , העליון דאור ס \" לע בכלים האורות התלבשות בבחינות דהיינו , הפרצוף דגוף ס \" הע מתפשטות ולמטה ומשם . גמורים ס \" שהע .\" דסוף ס \" ע \" ו \" דתוך ס \" ע \" הנקראות , ס \" ע של בחינות ' לב מתחלקות דגוף ס \" הע ואלו דסיום ס \" והע . בכלים האורות של התלבשות מקום ששם , הטבור עד מפה מקומן דתוך לכל מסיימת המלכות אשר , שפירושן , רגליו סיום עד ולמטה מטבורו מקומן , הפרצוף וסוף שם נפסק כ \" וע , אור שום לקבל ראויה שאינה , עצמה לבחינתה שמגיעה עד וספירה ספירה . הפרצוף בלי וריקן פנוי חלל ולמטה שמשם ,\" הפרצוף של רגלין אצבעות סיום \" מכונה זה הפסק ובחינת נכללים שניהם כי .\" ראש \" הנקראים , דשרשים ס \" מהע נמשכים הללו ס \" ע מיני ' שב , ותדע . אור . העליון לאור ומלביש העולה , ח \" האו שהוא , הלבשה כח שם יש כי . המזדווגת במלכות דהכאה הזווג נעשה ז \" שעי , האור תקבל שלא , המלכות על המסך של העיכוב כח שם יש גם כשמתפשטים אלא . בעלמא שורשים רק בהראש המה הללו כחות ' וב . חוזר אור המעלה עד ולמטה שמפה , דתוך ס \" בע לפועל יוצא , ההלבשה כח שהוא ,' הא כח הנה , למטה מלמעלה , וסיום דסוף ס \" בע לפועל יוצא , אור מלקבל המלכות על העיכוב כח שהוא ,' הב וכח . הטבור . רגלין אצבעות סיום עד ולמטה שמטבור כולן נקראות , הטבור עד שמפה , דתוך ס \" שהע . מ \" נהי ת \" חג תמיד נקראים הללו ס \" ע מיני ' וב .\" מ \" נהי \" בשם כולן נקראות , ולמטה שמטבור דסוף ס \" והע .\" ת \" חג \" בשם 50) As was stated above, there are two kinds of Malchut in each Partzuf: Malchut that makes a Zivug and Malchut that prevents the light from entering. Because of the Zivug de Haka’a that occurs on the Masach of the first Malchut, the 10 Sefirot of the Reflected Light emerge. They rise and dress onto the Upper Light, dividing it into ten Sefirot de Rosh, i.e., purely the roots of the Kelim."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 237 Then this Malchut expands downwards from the Masach via the ten Sefirot, spreading by the ten Sefirot de Guf, which means dressing of the light in the finished Kelim. The ten Sefirot de Guf are divided into two parts: the Toch and the Sof. The position of the ten Sefirot de Toch is from the Peh to the Tabur, where the lights dress in the Kelim. From the Tabur down to the “Sium Reglav” is the place of the ten Sefirot de Sof and Sium. It means that here Malchut restricts the reception of the light in each Sefira, having reached the maximum corresponding to the particular size of the Masach, until it reaches Malchut de Malchut, which is totally unfit to receive the light. This stage is called “the toe-tips of the Partzuf”. From that point and below there is an empty space devoid of the light (“Halal Panuy”). Both kinds of ten Sefirot de Toch and Sof descend from the ten Sefirot de Rosh and are included in Malchut Mizdaveget, since it has power to dress the Ohr Hozer on the Ohr Elion. There is also the force of the Masach that prevents the light from entering Malchut and raises the Ohr Hozer. These two forces are merely the roots, the germs of the Kelim. Then the first force of dress- ing the light from the Peh to the Tabur in the Toch of the Partzuf is activated, while the second restricting force starts acting in the ten Sefirot de Sof and Sium, from the Tabur down to the Sium Reglav. If we examine the entire Partzuf, i.e., the Rosh, Toch and Sof as a single whole like the common ten Sefirot, it turns out that the Rosh corresponds to the Sefirot Keter, Hochma and Bina – KaHaB, Gimel Rishonot, Gar (the three first Sefirot). Toch, i.e., the area from the Peh to the Tabur corresponds to the Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet (HaGaT). Sof, i.e., the area from the Tabur and below cor- responds to the Sefirot Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut (NHYM)."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 238 As it was said, the science of Kabbalah operates with its own special language of formulas, definitions, symbols, and graphs. The light is the sensation of the most exquisite pleasure. Then this sensation is graded into different parts according to its quantity and the quality. This is the source of the five lights of NaRaNHaY; each of them in turn consists of its own five lights. They depend on the sensation, the desire, the quality, and prop- erty of this desire, its intention and its selective abilities. Then the text describes the connection between the receiver’s properties (the Kli, sen- sor) and the perceptible information that it feels. In other words, all the perceptible information becomes strictly scientific, which allows one to describe these feelings. Neither psychology nor psychiatry can graduate it all, for they lack this mathematical data. Each person reacts in his own way in a certain situation; there is no common approach. In Kabbalah, the desire created by the Creator reveals itself completely. Everything is most accurately defined and described. Kabbalah provides the general method of attain- ment of the entire Universe. When man is on a certain spiritual level, he can qualitatively and quantitatively measure his own actions, vis-à-vis someone else who has already mastered and described this level. Each fragment of the Universe includes some other fragment in one of its Sefirot . So each person in one of his private sensations can feel someone else, i.e., include that person in himself or be included in the other. Thus, through self-knowledge and learning about his source with the help of Kabbalah, man gets to know other people and the entire Universe. The desire, Behina Dalet , is positioned in the area from the Peh to the Sium , i.e., these are the Toch and the Sof of the body of the spiritual Sof of the body of the spiritual Sof Partzuf . Depending on its screen, it divides itself into two parts. First, it Partzuf . Depending on its scr een, it divides itself int o tw o par ts.

At this"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 239 time, the Ohr Hassadim spreads inside Malchut . Then the desire to receive a portion of the light for the sake of the Creator spreads through it. What does this reception for the sake of the Creator mean? Let us take an example from our world. Suppose you would like to do some- thing really nice for a certain person. If he finds out that you did some- thing for him, you will definitely derive some benefit from it; say respect etc. In the spiritual world, neither I, nor someone I want to please, must know about it. Otherwise it will not be true giving. Let us assume that man wishes to absorb everything. Later he re- fused to receive anything for himself, and afterwards feels the “desire to give” everything to someone else to please him. This last stage is called Bina . When man is in this state, the Ohr Hassadim (pleasure from giving) enters him. However, the one he wished to please says, “If you really want to please me, start receiving.” Now you, as it were, should act in defiance of your previous “desire to give” and start receiving for his sake. This is extremely difficult to do. You cannot use all your “desire to give” on receiving for someone’s sake. It is very difficult to receive for someone else’s sake. You have to act in accordance with your innate egoism, i.e., to receive, but with an intention opposite to egoism – receive for the sake of the giver. Hence, it can only be done gradually. We see it in the example of Galgalta, which accepted the light only in the Toch , leaving the Sof empty; then the light of the Sof e m p t y ; t h e n t h e l i g h t o f t h e Sof Hassadim filled it. “Halal Panuy” constitutes those egoistic desires that have no screen. However, they will manifest only after the Breaking of the Kelim. Galgalta acts according to the law of TA . Later on, we will study the structure of the Partzufim in compliance with the law of TB (Tzimtzum Bet). All elements created there will be reflected in the structure of man’s soul."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 240 הרצון הוא שלה שהכלי , החכמה אור על אלא היה לא הצמצום ענין כי , לדעת יש עוד ( נא צמצום שום היה לא דחסדים אור על אבל . והמסך הצמצום נעשה שבה , ד \" בבחי הנגמר לקבל ואינו , מהמאציל הצורה ושינוי עביות שום בו שאין , להשפיע הרצון הוא שלו הכלי כי , כלל . תיקונים לשום צריך בלי יחדיו מקושרים , וחסדים חכמה האורות ' ב אלו נמצאים העליון דאור ס \" שבע לפי ז \" ועכ בכלים בהתלבשות כשבאים לפיכך , תכונתו לפי המתפשט אחד אור להיותם , ביניהם הפרש שום . צמצום נעשה לא שעליו י \" אעפ , המלכות על נפסק דחסדים אור גם הנה , הצמצום אחר , משהו אף שם להתפשט יכול החכמה אור שאין , במקום מתפשט דחסדים אור היה אם כי מוכרח היה דחסדים האור כי . העליון באור שבירה נעשת היתה , המסיימת במלכות דהיינו לגמרי וריקן פנוי חלל לבחינת המסיימת מלכות נעשה ולפיכך . החכמה מאור לגמרי להפרד . דחסדים מאור ואפילו 51) One also has to know that TA was referred exclusively to the Ohr Hochma, which was in the Kli, the “desire to receive”, which ended in the Behina Dalet. A Tzimtzum was made and the Masach was created on this specific Behina. The Ohr Hassadim, however, was not restricted at all, since its Kli is the “desire to bestow”, which has no Aviut, and whose properties do not differ from those of the Creator, hence require no correction. As was already stated, the Creator’s light is one and indivisible; the Ohr Hochma and the Ohr Hassadim are inseparably connected and spreading together, filling the vessels. According to its inner proper- ties, the Kli distinguishes various kinds of pleasure in the light – the Ohr Hochma (pleasure from the direct reception of the light) and the Ohr Hassadim (pleasure from the equivalence of the vessel’s inner properties with those of the Creator). Therefore when, after TA, the light exits from the Kelim, the Ohr Hassadim stops spreading in Malchut as well as the Ohr Hochma, while there was no Restriction on the Ohr Hassadim. If the Ohr Hassadim had been able to enter Malchut, which resisted the light of Hochma, the light would have been shattered in it, for the Ohr Hassadim would have had to completely separate from the Ohr Ho- chma. Nevertheless, since that is impossible, Malchut Mesayemet is left quite empty of even the light of the Hassadim."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 241 One can give infinitely; there is no ban on it. Everything that was ever created in Malchut of the World of Infinity is based on the restric- tion imposed on the “desire to receive”. If man feels a powerful desire and it is genuine, he will hear the Creator say “If you really wish to give, start receiving”. This will be the measure of giving. In fact, there is nothing man can possibly give, since he does not generate the light; but only consumes it. We can “give” only our intention; in action, we can at most either receive or not receive. Man’s true natural desire is to receive. Look at a small child; it is pure egoism in action. We are born with it. In our world, I can refrain from using this desire. I want to receive or do something, but I will re- strict myself, will not take advantage of my desire. To that end, I must imagine a gain that, by my abstinence, may be more considerable than by fulfilling my desire. The process of purchase and sale takes place here. If I think of some nice profit from the restriction, I will be able to work with my ego- istic desire. Let us suppose that I want to steal some money lying on the table. In this case, I need clearly to imagine how the theft will lead me to jail and how I will only lose from it. Then it is not worth it. Everything is precisely evaluated in our world. Both giving and re- ceiving are in any case egoistic here. You just do what seems to be the most favorable thing in the given situation. In the spiritual world, one can only be exposed to the Upper Light, which transforms your true natural property of reception. It provides you with the screen. We can- not understand what it means. However, with its help we stop thinking about filling our egoism. The first correction consists in gaining strength to stop filling yourself. If you can meet this condition, it is called the Tzimtzum Aleph . You see that reception for the sake of reception is detrimental for you. Then you are given a stronger desire – to receive through giving to the Cre- ator. Where does it come from? You begin to see that there is something"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 242 called the Creator, that He is so enormous and great, that He includes you in Himself. This feeling grips you so that you wish to give to Him; you acquire the screen for the egoistic desires. When the screen for the Behinot Shoresh, Aleph, and Bet appears, the desire is still not very strong. When there is a screen for Behinot Gimel and Dalet , you become one great “desire to give”. However, what can you actually give? Here the Creator tells you that only by receiving His light and enjoying it can you give to Him. Having transformed the intention from egoistic to altruistic, for the Creator’s sake, you start receiving. The end of correction comes when you acquire the intention for the sake of the Creator on all your egoistic desires and receive all His light. The “desire to receive” for the sake of the Creator is not egoistic, since it went through several phases of correction. The “desire to receive” for one’s own sake turns first into the desire to receive nothing at all. Then the “desire to give” everything to the Creator appears; and finally, the desire to receive everything from the Creator with the intention to bestow upon Him. לומר כלל אפשר אי כי . ולמטה שמטבור הפרצוף דסוף ס \" הע של תוכנם תבין זה ועם ( נב מאור לגמרי לעולם נפרד דחסדים האור אין כי , כלל חכמה בלי החסדים אור בחינת רק שהן הזו מועטת שהארה ותדע . החכמה מאור גם מועטת הארה בהכרח בהן שיש אלא . החכמה הנקראות , שבפרצוף ס \" הע בחינות ' ג נתבארו והנה .\" ראש בלי ק \" ו \" בשם תמיד מכנים אנו .\" סוף \" ,\" תוך \" ,\" ראש \" 52) Now, we can understand what the 10 Sefirot from the Tabur and below are. It would be wrong to say there is only the Ohr Hassadim without any Ohr Hochma. There has to be some faint luminescence of the Ohr Hochma called VAK bli Rosh (6 ends without a head). There are 10 Sefirot in any Partzuf: the Gar is Keter, Hochma, and Bina: the Ohr Hochma is present there in all its greatness. Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod and Yesod form VAK, where there is the Ohr Hassadim and a little Ohr Hochma. The tenth Sefira Malchut remains empty."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 243 כי , ידעת וזה . לזה זה ק \" דא ג \" וס ב \" ע גלגלתא הפרצופים הלבשת סדר ענין נבאר ועתה ( נג והמסך המלכות אל הצורה בהשואת ונעשה שנזדכך אחר , דעליון דגוף ממסך יוצא תחתון כל . שבו דהכאה בזווג שבראש במסך נכלל אז כי . שבראש הנה , דגוף במסך הנשאר והתלבשות עביות הרשימות ' בב דהכאה הזווג עליו שנעשה ואחר יוצאת שהקומה , לנו נבחן ההוא הכר י \" וע . דגוף עביות מבחינת שהיא , שבו העביות הוכרה , שורשה במקום דהיינו , שלו הגוף לבחינת ומלבשת ויורדת , ק \" דא ' הא דפרצוף ראש מבחינת . היא דגוף ממסך כי הטבור למקום החדש הפרצוף של המזדווגת המלכות עם המסך לירד צריך היה ובאמת שורש שמשם ,' הא פרצוף של המסיימת מלכות עם דגוף המסך מתחיל שם כי ,' הא דפרצוף בסבת , מהמסך נאבדה דעביות האחרונה שהבחינה מתוך אלא . ואחיזתו החדש הפרצוף הזאת ג \" בחי אשר . דעביות ג \" בחי זולת במסך נשאר ולא ( מ אות ) פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש ושורש אחיזה שום החדש דפרצוף המזדווגת ומלכות למסך אין ולפיכך . חזה נקרא דעביות . בשורשו כענף שם דבוק והוא . שלו בחזה רק אלא , דעליון בטבור 53) And now let us examine the order in which the Partzufim Galgalta, AB and SAG dress on one another. It is known that each subsequent Partzuf emerges from the Masach de Guf of the previous one after los- ing its Aviut, ascending, and merging with the Masach de Rosh. A Zivug de Haka’a with this screen is made on two kinds of the Reshimot left in the Masach de Guf of the previous Partzuf: Aviut and Hitlabshut. The Partzuf that emerges from the Rosh of the previ- ous one descends to its Guf and dresses onto it, i.e., on its root, the Masach de Guf. In fact, the Masach of the new Partzuf and Malchut Mizdaveget are supposed to descend to the Tabur of the previous Partzuf, since that is the place of the root and the attachment of the new Partzuf. How- ever, owing to the Ohr Makif and Pnimi, the Masach of the previous Partzuf lost the last Behina de Aviut. Thus, only Behina Gimel de Aviut (Chazeh) remained; hence, the Masach and Malchut of the new Partzuf have no connection with the Tabur of the previous one, but only in its Chazeh, where it is attached as a branch to its root. We learn how the entire Universe consisting of five worlds was cre- ated. We learn what preceded the creation of our universe, man. We have"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 244 also learned how the Upper forces gradually transformed, weakened, di- vided, deteriorated in quality and size, in order to recreate everything to allow the Creation to achieve the most perfect state, become equal to the Creator. It was necessary to create such an interaction between all forces that would gradually and following a certain order, influence the entire Creation, and raise all its elements to the highest spiritual level. In fact, the Universe is a shell that, on the one hand, separates the Creator from the Creation, and, on the other hand, unites them. The creation of this shell required a huge number of levels on which the future Creation, corresponding to the properties of each level, was modeled. To that end, each of these levels had to be fully adapted to the Creation. Now we are beginning to study how the supreme power (the Creator) adjusts itself to the inferior system. י \" ע שם ומוציא .' הא דפרצוף החזה למקום יורד החדש דפרצוף שהמסך , נמצא ולפיכך ( נד דראש המלכות שהוא , דעליון הפה עד , ולמעלה ממנו דראש ס \" ע העליון אור עם דהכאה זווג , משהו אף להלביש יכול התחתון אין העליון פרצוף של דראש ס \" הע את אבל .' הא דפרצוף . העליון של דגוף מסך מבחינת רק להיותו ומקומם . התחתון של וסוף בתוך ,\" דגוף ס \" ע \" הנקראות , למטה ממעלה ס \" ע מוציא כ \" ואח דסיום ס \" הע מקום הוא ולמטה מטבור כי . בלבד שלו הטבור עד ולמטה העליון דפרצוף מחזה ממנו נאבדה כי , העליון של אחרונה בבחינה אחיזה להתחתון ואין , ד \" בחי שהיא , העליון של .( מ אות ) הזדככותו בעת מוכרח ,\" ק \" דא ב \" ע פרצוף \" או \" ק \" דא החכמה פרצוף \" הנקרא , ההוא התחתון פרצוף כ \" וע , ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ס \" רת שכל , היטב ונתבאר . ק \" דא ' הא פרצוף של מטבור למעלה להסתיים מקום עד ' הא דפרצוף הפה שמתחת ממקום עומדים המה , ק \" דא ' הא דפרצוף התחתון שהוא מלכות דהיינו , ב \" ע פרצוף של דראש פה מקום הוא ' הא דפרצוף שהחזה , באופן . שלו הטבור . המסיימת מלכות דהיינו , ב \" ע דפרצוף רגלין סיום מקום הוא ' הא דפרצוף והטבור . המזדווגת 54) Therefore, the Masach of the new Partzuf (AB) descends to the Chazeh of the previous one (Galgalta). With the help of a Zivug de Haka’a with the Upper Light it creates the ten Sefirot de Rosh from the Chazeh and above – up to the Peh of the previous Partzuf, where its Malchut de Rosh is. The lower Partzuf is unable to dress the ten Sefirot de Rosh of the higher one, because it is born from the Masach de Guf of the higher Partzuf and not from its head."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 245 Each subsequent Partzuf can attain only the Guf of the preceding one, its root, and not the Rosh – the calculations, the thoughts and the mind of the previous Partzuf. Next, the screen creates ten Sefirot de Guf of the new Partzuf from the Chazeh down to the Tabur of the previous one, while from the Tabur and below, there are ten Se- firot de Sium of the previous Partzuf. In other words, there is Behina Dalet, with which the new Partzuf cannot work due to the loss of the last Behina de Aviut during the weakening of the screen. Therefore, the position of the Rosh, Toch, and Sof of the Partzuf AB is from the Peh de Galgalta to the Tabur. At that, the Chazeh de Galgalta is the Peh de AB, i.e., Malchut Mizdaveget, and the Tabur de Galgalta is the Sium de AB (Malchut Mesayemet). סוף עד הפרצופים בכל הוא כן , ק \" דא ' הא מפרצוף ב \" ע פרצוף יציאת בסדר שנתבאר וכמו ( נה דמלכות במסך ונכלל שנזדכך אחר , שלו דעליון דגוף ממסך יוצא תחתון שכל , העשיה עולם ומוציא , דעליון בגוף אחיזתו למקום משם יורד ז \" ואח , שם אשר דהכאה בזווג דעליון דראש מתפשט וגם , למעלה ממטה דראש ס \" הע את העליון אור עם דהכאה זווג י \" ע במקומו גם סיום בענין אלא . ק \" דא ב \" ע בפרצוף שנתבאר ד \" ע , וסוף בתוך דגוף ס \" לע למטה ממעלה . במקומו ש \" כמ , חילוקים יש הפרצוף 55) The order of the creation of the Partzuf AB from Galgalta ap- plies to the formation of on the rest of the Partzufim, down to the lowest Sefira of the world of Assiya. It consists in the fact that each subsequent Partzuf emerges from the Masach de Guf of the previous one. After the Masach loses its strength, it ascends and merges with the Masach of Malchut de Rosh of the preceding Partzuf, making a Zivug de Haka’a with it. Then it descends to the Chazeh of the previous Partzuf and there, after a Zivug with the Upper Light, the ten Sefirot de Rosh arise as well as ten Sefirot Toch and Sof de Guf, thus forming the Partzuf AB of the world of Adam Kadmon."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 246 T H E T Z I M T Z U M B E T : C A L L E D T H E T Z I M T Z U M N H Y D E A K ק \" דא י \" נה צמצום הנקרא ' ב צמצום תקבל שלא , ד \" הבחי שהיא , המלכות כלי על שנעשה ,' א הצמצום ענין היטב נתבאר והנה ( נו , ח \" או המעלה , העליון האור עם שלו דהכאה והזווג , המסך ענין וכן . העליון אור לתוכה , דגוף המסך של ההזדככות ענין וכן . ד \" הבחי במקום חדשים קבלה לכלי נעשה הזה ח \" שהאו דגוף א \" טנת הבחינות ' ד המוציאה , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש מפאת , פרצוף דכל בגופים הנעשה אור עם דהכאה לזווג ומכשרתו , ראש של מסך לבחינת דגוף המסך את והמעלה , פרצוף דכל פרצופים ' ג יציאת וכן . הקודם מהפרצוף אחת במדרגה הנמוך , שני פרצוף נולד שעליו , העליון . זה את זה הלבשתם וסדר ,\" ג \" ס \" ,\" ב \" ע \" ,\" גלגלתא \" הנקראים , ק \" דא הראשונים 56) Thus, we have cleared up the meaning of TA, which was made on Behina Dalet – the Kli Malchut, as it stopped receiving the light. We have also spoken of the Masach and its Zivug de Haka’a with the Upper Light. It raises the Ohr Hozer, which plays the role of the new vessel of reception instead of Behina Dalet. Then we discussed the weakening of the Masach de Guf that hap- Masach de Guf t h a t h a p - Masach de Guf pened because of the impact between the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Makif a n d t h e Ohr Makif Ohr Pnimi . These processes led to the formation of the Ta’amim, Nekudot, Tagin and Otiot de Guf in each Otiot de Guf i n e a c h Otiot de Guf Partzuf , and the ascent of the Partzuf , a n d t h e a s c e n t o f t h e Partzuf Masach to the Masach t o t h e Masach Peh de Rosh and its Zivug de Haka’a with the Upper Light. As a result, the second Partzuf is born one level below the first and then the third. These Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon are called Galgalta , AB and SAG . Each subsequent Partzuf dresses onto the preceding one from the Partzuf d r e s s e s o n t o t h e p r e c e d i n g o n e f r o m t h e Partzuf Peh de Rosh and below. Peh de Rosh a n d b e l o w .

The root of the desired correction has not yet been revealed, that being the reason for the Tzimtzum Aleph. It was made to provide Behina Dalet with an opportunity to receive the Upper Light, and then create man from it, who, with the help of the Torah and the Commandments for the sake of the Creator, could transform reception into giving. Then Behina Dalet would become the vessel of reception of the Up- per Light, merging with it by its properties. However, the root of such correction has not yet even been revealed in the world of Adam Kadmon. For that, man should consist not only of the Behina Dalet – the “desire to receive” – but also possess the properties that refer to the first nine Sefirot, i.e., the “desire to bestow”, allowing him \"to perform good deeds\" (to give). If man had appeared at the state in which the Partzufim de Adam Kadmon had been, he would have had no light at all, because the Be- hina Dalet, being the root of man’s spiritual body, would have been"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 248 below the Sium of the world of Adam Kadmon in total darkness and absolutely opposite to the light by its properties. Had man been created of such “material”, he would never have cor- rected himself due to the lack of even the slightest “desire to give”. He would have been considered an animal, living only for itself. Similarly, sinners bogged down in their “desire to receive” only for themselves, even while doing good deeds, are called dead during their life. The Creator created a single creation – Behina Dalet – the “desire to receive”, egoism, man, Malchut . Having received the light inside, Behina Dalet felt emptiness. In the spiritual world, such straightforward recep- tion leads to death. Upon realizing this, it wished to be like the Creator and stopped receiving the light by making a Tzimtzum. By doing this, it did not be- come like the Creator, but rather stopped being opposite to Him in its properties. The Creator allotted His own properties to the four phases of Malchut’s development. However, since Malchut itself is no longer His property, it is called the “creation”, the “desire to receive”. How can Malchut be made equal to the Creator? To this end, it must receive, but only for His sake. If Malchut sees that by receiving it pleases the Creator, it must begin to do so. Where can Malchut get such altruistic properties?It must come from Bina , for Bina is the “desire to bestow”. To accomplish this, we need to combine Bina’s desire not to receive anything with Malchut’s “desire to receive” for its own sake. If that can be done, it will be possible to give Malchut the intention to receive for the Creator’s sake. A desire cannot be transformed. It is our nature and is not subject to change. If it is possible to give Malchut such an intention, it can receive the Creator’s entire light and reach the Gmar Tikkun . How can we bring to- gether and mix these two opposing properties? We must have something common between them. For this, we must break Bina and Malchut – the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 249 “desire to receive” and the “desire to give” – and mix the fragments very thoroughly so that each spiritual object that emerged after this breaking may possess these two desires. For this purpose, one of Bina’s properties must be “spoiled”, in or- der for it somehow to become similar to Malchut. In other words, Bina ’ s intention to bestow for the sake of the Creator must be “spoiled”, con- verted, as it were, into the “desire to give” for the sake of reception. Its intentions would become similar to those of Malchut , even though Bina receives nothing, while Malchut wants to get everything. In this way, Bina “spoils” its intention and becomes selfish like Malchut. Now it is neces- sary to inculcate Bina’s property into Malchut. This is done with the help of the stroke penetration, an explosion that will mix their properties so thoroughly that it will be practically im- possible to divide them. If this can be done, we will be able to irradiate this common mass with the Upper Light until Bina retrieves its previous intention for the sake of the Creator. Then Malchut, in this mass, will also acquire the intention to receive for the sake of the Creator. In the world of Adam Kadmon, the Partzuf Galgalta is Keter ; AB is Hochma ; SAG is Bina. It should be noted that everything that is in the Sof of Sof of Sof Galgalta , or below its Tabur , is Malchut. That is why, in order to mix Bina with Malchut, it should be placed under the Tabur of Tabur of Tabur Galgalta . Malchut passes three states: 1. When it received everything prior to the Tzimtzum Aleph 2. The state of correction 3. The state of reception for the sake of the Creator. Throughout this time, Malchut never changed its action – neither before the Tzimtzum Aleph, nor after it. The correction consisted merely in transforming the intention to receive for itself into receiving for the sake of the Creator. This is what the Universe was created for. This inten- tion is received from Bina ."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 250 Malchut of the World of Infinity that is mixed with Bina is called Adam , man. The entire system of the worlds, the Universe, is aimed only at changing Malchut’s intention. The reception for the sake of the Cre- ator is called Kabbalah. וראה . הדין במדת העולם את לברא במחשבה עלה בתחלה \" :( ב \" ספי ר \" ב ) ל \" חז ש \" מ ס \" וז ( נח תחילה \" כל כי : פירוש .\" הדין למדת ושתפה הרחמים מדת והקדים , מתקיים העולם שאין , העולמות של הראשונה שהסבה , ש \" וז .\" ומסובב סבה \" פירושו , ברוחניות הנאמר ,\" כ \" ואח מלכות בבחינת דהיינו , הדין במדת נאצלו , העולמות כל תחילת שנאצלו , ק \" א פרצופי דהיינו וסיום פנוי חלל בבחינת ויצאה שנצטמצמה , ד \" הבחי דהיינו ,\" הדין מדת \" הנקראת , לבד וריקן פנוי חלל בבחינת ק \" א רגלי מסיום למטה הנמצאת , ז \" דעוה הנקודה ס \" שה . ק \" א לרגלי . אור מכל הצריך , לאדם אפשרות שום היה לא זה שבאופן , ל \" כנ דהיינו .\" מתקיים העולם שאין וראה \" התיקון במדת העולם יתקיים ידו שעל , השפעה של מעשים לסגל שיוכל , הזו ד \" מבחי להברא .\" הדין למדת ושתפה הרחמים מדת הקדים \" לכן , הנרצה 58) In the beginning, the Creator’s conception was to create the world with the properties of \"Din\" (judgment). This means that, if something were created from the “material” taken from the first nine Sefirot, it would possess only the “desire to give”. On the other hand, something created from the “material” taken from under the Tabur would have only the “desire to receive”. Then the Creator “saw” that the world could not exist this way. So He mixed the desire to receive with the desire to give. What does this mean? Did He not know in advance that the world would not be able to exist this way? Everything that was, is and will be – the entire Universe, was built according to the principle of “cause and effect”. There is neither beginning nor end; only cause and effect. Moreover, the first cause of the worlds, (the Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon, created before all other worlds) was the property of judgment, i.e., Malchut’s decision not to receive the light for its own pleasure. As was already said, if man had been created from Behina Dalet (Malchut) at this stage (Malchut de Malchut, Dalet de Dalet, i.e., the complete “desire to receive”, the only Creation, and the rest"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 251 being the transition from the Creator to the creation), he would never have been able to correct the egoistic “desire to receive”. When it is said that, in the beginning the Creator created the world with the properties of judgment, this means that He initially created the world Adam Kadmon as distinctly divided into two kinds of vessels: “giv- ing” and “receiving” – Malchut. However, inside this Malchut there was not even a single spark of the “desire to give”, i.e., it could not receive at all, thus failing to fulfill the Purpose of the Creation (to please the Creator). The Creator mixed the “desire to give” (Bina) with the “desire to receive” (Malchut) so that Malchut could receive with the altruistic intention. משום ,\" הדין מדת \" נקראת המלכות וספירת .\" הרחמים מדת \" נקראת בינה ספירת : פרוש , המלכות בספירת הנעשה הסיום כח שהוא , הדין מדת העלה והמאציל . הצמצום נעשה שעליה הזה השתתפות י \" שע , בזה זה יחד אותם ושיתף . הרחמים מדת שהיא , הבינה אל אותה והעלה נעשה ובזה . דבינה שבהכלי , השפעה מניצוצי כלולה , הדין מדת שהיא , ד \" הבחי גם נעשית מעשים לעשות יוכל אשר , ההשפעה ממדת גם כלול שיהיה , ד \" מבחי היוצא , האדם לגוף הכשר , להשפיע מ \" ע כולה שתהיה שבו הקבלה מדת שיהפך עד , ליוצרו ר \" נ להשפיע מ \" ע טובים . העולם מבריאת הנרצה לתיקון העולם יתקיים ז \" שעי To this end He raised the property of judgment, i.e., the force of restriction that is in Malchut to Bina, and mixed them until Behina Dalet included the sparks of the “desire to give” that are present in Bina. This allowed man, who was later created from Behina Dalet, to acquire the sparks of giving, so that afterwards, by doing good deeds, he would completely change his properties (the “desire to re- ceive”) and thus ensure the existence of the world. It should be noted that the mixing of Bina and Malchut is an ex- tremely complex process that passed several phases, which we are about to examine. Ultimately, the Creator broke both Bina and Malchut into many tiny fragments and thoroughly mixed them. It turned out that each fragment had properties of both Bina and Malchut. This fragment is man’s soul."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 252 “Our world” is a spiritual category, a spiritual property of absolute egoism, which remains empty and unable to receive anything. Before the souls were created, and fell to the lowest possible level, everything is thought to have been made by the Creator. In fact, only man, totally detached from the Creator, can be called the creation. When the creation is filled with the light, it does not understand anything; it is blind. It has no freedom of choice; everything is predeter- mined inside and outside of it. It is only to the extent of acquiring the Masach that Malchut that Malc hut that begins to ascend to the Creator’s level. All the Partzufim of the world AK (Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA and BON), end above the Tabur of Tabur of Tabur Galgalta . So how can these Partzufim sud- denly descend below that level? We can understand the descent of the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG below the Tabur , since this Partzuf is pure Partzuf is pur e Partzuf Bina , which desires nothing for itself. There is no Tzimtzum on the light of Bina ( the Ohr Hassadim) ; hence, it can descend under the Tabur . The Partzuf Nekudot de SAG feels perfectly well in any situation, in any place in the spiritual space. Bina is characterized by a freedom of choice and behavior that are above all restrictions. As the soul acquires the properties of Bina , it becomes more and more free. The Partzuf Nekudot de SAG is reluctant to receive anything, ignoring even the most intense desire – the Aviut Dalet ; hence, it could descend under the Tabur de Galgalta unrestricted. Both the Ohr SAG (Bina) and the Ohr AB (Hochma) descend to the world of Nikudim. world of Nik udim. world of How is it possible? AB can descend under the Tabur in order to correct the lower Partzufim ; it becomes similar to them in its properties, although its mission is quite different. All the worlds are not the created beings, but constitute the Cre- ator’s attire, made in the power and quality of their restriction in such a way that each soul receives only a certain portion of the light. The souls"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 253 strive after the Creator while retaining their freedom of will, some sort of illusionary choice. All the worlds and the Partzufim are still objects, “robots”. They have no independence, no freedom of choice. Only man – the combina- tion of Malchut de Malchut, the essence of the “desire to receive”, with Bina , the “desire to bestow” – can be considered the creation. As in all other worlds, AK consists of five AK consis ts of f iv e AK Partzufim . These Partzu- fim emerge because of the same process – the weakening and rising of the Masach . Keter , Hochma , and Bina (the higher Partzufim ) control the lower ones. They are direct representatives of the Creator, of His desire to fulfill the Thought of the Creation. Keter (Behina Shoresh) is the Creator’s thought to create and bestow delight upon the created beings. Hochma (Behina Aleph) Hochma (Behina Aleph) Hochma is the delight the Creator wishes to bestow upon the created beings. It is both the vessel and the light of Hochma inside it. Bina ( Behina Bet ) is the Creator’s own property, the desire not to receive anything. All three upper Sefirot represent the Creator’s proper- ties. With these, He created the creation and instilled into it two op- posing desires. On the one hand, there is the desire to receive pleasure; conversely, there is the desire to bestow. This duality is completely real- ized in Behina Dalet . ZA ( Behina Gimel ) and Malchut (Behina Dalet) Malchut (Behina Dale t) Malchut are not the Cre- ator’s properties. They are rather by now their consequences, their real- ization. The Creator’s properties are defined differently in each world. In the world of the Nikudim they are Keter and Abba ve Ima . In the world of Atzilut, they are called Atik, Arich Anpin, and Abba ve Ima. The names differ, but the meaning is the same. At all stages of the creation, there are five essential levels. The end result is important: how does Behina Dalet achieve perfection? How can"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 254 each of the five properties, which in turn consist of their own five, be elevated to the level of perfection? Each property of the soul corresponds to the specific force that pulls it up, corrects it, and leads it to absolute perfection. Soon we will begin to study the world of the Nikudim. This world emerged and broke in order that each “broken” fragment of the light would adapt itself to a fragment of the soul, and find points of contact with it for future correction..

This led to the emergence of a new Sium of the Upper Light in the place where Bina is. Malchut, which prevented the light from spreading into the Sof of Galgalta at the level of the Sium Reglav (positioned a little above the point of this world), rose to Bina de Guf of the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG. It then restricted the light of the up- per half of Bina de Guf, called Tifferet. Indeed, Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet correspond to Keter, Hochma and Bina de Guf; so it turns out that Bina de Guf is Tifferet. Mal- chut, which was in the Peh de Rosh, rose to the Nikvey Einaim (pupils of the eyes), i.e., to the line separating the vessels of bestowal (Galgalta) from the vessels of reception (AHP) of Bina de Rosh. From there, it made a necessary Zivug for the creation of the Partzuf MA de AK, called the world of Nikudim (or the lower MA)."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 255 The Partzuf SAG has the Reshimot Gimel (3) de Hitlabshut and Bet (2) de Aviut . This means that, in principle, SAG is the Partzuf Bina with the Ohr Hassadim inside, which is determined by the main Reshimo Bet de Aviut. However, SAG has also the Hitlabshut Gimel – the memory of the previous state ( the Partzuf AB, the Partzuf Hochma). Hence, there is a slight luminescence of the Ohr Hochma inside the Partzuf SAG. As long as this luminescence is inside SAG , it cannot descend below the Tabur. Before the rise of its Masach, the Partzuf SAG still has some proper- ties of the Partzuf Hochma – “Hochma be Kiruv”. Because of the rise of the Masach and expulsion of the light caused by the impact between the Ohr Pnimi and the Ohr Makif , some radical changes take place in Ohr Makif , some r adical c hanges t ak e place in Ohr Makif SAG . As was stated, each rise of the screen from one level to another is accompanied by a series of intermediate Zivugim de Haka’a that lead to the formation of interim Partzufim called “ the Nekudot” (in this case the Nekudot de SAG ). The very first rise of the screen (from Malchut de SAG to ZA de SAG ), which leads to expulsion of the light Yechida de Bina , naturally calls forth the expulsion of luminescence of the Ohr Hochma ,stimulated by the presence of the Reshimo de Hitlabshut Gimel in SAG . Because of this , “Hochma be Kiruv” disappears, and SAG turns into the Partzuf of pure Partzuf of pur e Partzuf Bina , which has the Reshimot Bet de Aviut and Bet de Hitlabshut . The Reshimot Bet de Aviut and Bet de Hitlabshut - pure Bina – can de- scend below the Tabur. Therefore, the Nekudot de SAG freely descended under the Tabur of the world of Tabur of the w orld of Tabur AK , since even the Masach de Galgalta was too weak to fill these desires below the Tabur with the Tabur with the Tabur Ohr Hochma . Generally, the process of transition takes place from the Partzuf SAG (Gimel/Bet) to the Partzuf MA (Bet/Aleph). Hence, the Nekudot de SAG , which has the Reshimot Bet/Bet, constitutes an intermediate Partzuf. Like all the other Sefirot , Bina in turn consists of its own five: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA and Malchut. ZA represents an interim stage between the three upper Sefirot and the vessel of reception – Malchut. This is a common property of the Creator and Malchut . In a sense, it links them"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 256 together and consequently consists of six Sefirot : Hesed is similar to Keter ; Gevura to Hochma ; Tifferet to Bina . While Netzah is the property of ZA it- self, Hod is similar to Malchut and Yesod is the sum of all the properties. Therefore, Tifferet in ZA is Bina . If we also divide it crosswise, it will similarly consist of Keter, Hochma, Bina (KaHaB), Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet (HaGaT) and Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut (NHYM) . If we di- vide Tifferet into one third and two thirds, it will turn out that the light descends only to its upper third, spreading no further. The point where the vessels of bestowal get separated from the vessels of reception, Bina from Malchut , is called “ the Parsa” . The desires KaHaB-HaGaT are called KaHaB-HaGaT ar e called KaHaB-HaGaT GE (Galgalta ve Eynaim) – the altruistic desires. The desires NHYM , the egoistic Kelim, are called Aw- zen. The lower part of Tifferet – Netzah and Hod are Hotem, while Yesod and Peh are Malchut. This combination is called AHP (Awzen, Hotem, and Peh). Now the creation can work only with GE , whereas the Kelim with a touch of egoism (AHP) are not used. The Tzimtzum Bet is a source of all our souls. The Torah (the chap- ter Bereshit ) begins at this very moment. From this point, we start speak- ing about man’s soul; until then there was no root of the creation. First it was necessary to make Tzimtzum Aleph , then descend to the Nekudot de SAG to make Tzimtzum Bet , break all the good and bad properties in order to mix them, and finally to start building a totally new system. This system is a combination of Good and Evil, the right and the left line, the systems of pure and impure forces. Bina (the Creator’s properties) has to descend to such a level where it can become equal to the properties of Malchut , i.e., spoil itself to the extent of becoming similar to the property of reception for its own sake. How can this happen? Malchut divides Bina into GE and AHP , stands between them, and influences the lower part of Bina ( Zat – the seven lower Sefirot de Bina ) so"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 257 that its properties become equal to those of Malchut . The upper part of Bina (Gar) remains altruistic as before. This is called Tzimtzum Bet ( TB ). The Creator deliberately “spoils” Bina , i.e., His own property, so that it would become similar to the property of reception and merge with it. Next, He gradually shows it how much better His properties are, encouraging it to adopt them and slowly move up toward Him. Above Malchut, there is a choice to apply the intention for the sake of bestowal; below Malchut’ s domain, there is no such option. So, if Mal- chut ascends to Bina, from that point and downwards there is no choice. All of the Behinot , the properties below Bina , fell under the power of the egoistic desires. Let us review in a general way the ascent of Malchut to Malchut t o Malchut Bina . Is it pos- sible that the “desire to receive” appeared in Bina ? First, let us clear up the notion “ the Tet Rishonot” , the nine upper Sefirot, and Malchut in general. Malchut i n g e n e r a l . Malchut Rabbi Baruch Ashlag gives the following example: Man has the Kelim called eyes, ears, nose, and mouth that dress the sight, hearing, smell and speech. Of course, these Kelim are very important. If man’s eyes are damaged, he cannot see; if his ears are damaged, he cannot hear. Nevertheless, sometimes man does not use his senses. When does this happen? When he goes to sleep. It turns out that when man wants to receive pleasure through his senses, he uses them; but when he wants to enjoy rest, he ignores them. Hence, we see that the true Kli is a desire to receive pleasure. Our senses are not the Kelim ; they only serve that desire. In accordance with our example, the nine upper Sefirot are sight, hearing, smell and speech, i.e., the light and the vessel. Each type of light dresses into its corresponding Kli , but the Kelim of the first nine Sefirot are not genuine. This is because the Kli is a desire to receive pleasure and is present only in Malchut . These Kelim are necessary only for the dressing of the light, as in the example with sight, hearing etc. So who"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 258 receives pleasure from the first nine Sefirot ? It is the “desire to receive”, called “ Malchut ”. Now let us return to the question of Malchut rising to Bina . Is it possible for an ear to have a “desire to receive”? Everything we discuss here refers to whatever Malchut receives from the first nine Sefirot . After the Second Restriction, Malchut attains only a half of Bina and above. פרצוף עם בשוה מסתיים שהיה , ק \" דא ג \" הס כי .\" ק \" דא י \" נה צמצום \" כ \" ג מכונה וזה ( ס נמצא , בינה במקום המלכות ועלית השיתוף י \" ע הנה , ז \" דעוה הנקודה ממעל , ק \" דא גלגלתא ק \" דא דגוף בינה חצי שהוא , ת \" ת חצי במקום דהיינו , הפנימי ק \" דא לטבור ממעל מסתיים . ולמטה ממנה יתפשט שלא , העליון אור ועכבה , המסיימת מלכות עלתה שם כי . הפנימי מאור ונתרוקנו שנצטמצמו , ג \" דס י \" התנה ונמצאו . אור בלי וריקן פנוי חלל שם נעשה כ \" וע שנעשה , החדש סיום י \" ע כי .\" ק \" דא י \" נה צמצום \" בשם ' ב הצמצום נקרא ולפיכך . העליון יצאו , ג \" הס דראש פ \" שאח , נבחן וכן . מאורותיהם ק \" דא ג \" דס י \" הנה נתרוקנו , הטבור במקום , עינים לנקבי עלתה המזדווגת המלכות כי . שלו גוף לבחינת ונעשו , ג \" הס ראש ממדרגת גוף \" נקרא כבר ולמטה העינים ומנקבי . ולמעלה העינים שבנקבי מהמסך דראש ס \" הע ויצאו . גוף בחינת היא שזו , ולמטה עינים שמנקבי הארה רק לקבל יכול אינו כי ,\" הפרצוף .\" הנקודים עולם \" הנקראות ס \" הע הן , ק \" דא ג \" דס עינים בנקבי שיצאה , הללו ס \" הע קומת והנה שם ונתפשטו . הפנימי ק \" דא מטבור למטה שהוא , למקומן ובאו , ג \" דס עינים מנקבי שירדו .\" פרסה \" בשם מכונה , דגוף הבינה במקום הנעשה , ל \" הנ החדש הסיום כי , ותדע . וגוף ראש ספירות והעשר .\" הנקודים עולם \" נקראים החיצוניות ס \" הע ורק . וחיצוניות פנימיות כאן ויש . עצמו \" ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ \" נקראים הפנימיות 60) Tzimtzum Bet is also called Tzimtzum NHYM de AK (if we divide the Partzuf Galgalta into the ten Sefirot, then the Rosh will be KaHaB, Toch – HaGaT and Sof - NHYM). This is because the Nekudot de SAG, which ended above the point of our world dur- ing Malchut's rising to Bina and interacting with it, end below the Tabur of Galgalta in Tifferet de Guf of Galgalta, where Malchut Mesayemet rose. An empty space absolutely devoid of the light was formed under Malchut in the place of the egoistic desires NHYM de SAG, which restricted reception of the light and were left empty. The AHP de Rosh de SAG were separated from GE and began to play the role"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 259 of the Guf. The ten Sefirot de Rosh rose from the Nikvey Eynaim (the boundary between Gar de Bina and Zat de Bina) and higher, while the Guf was formed underneath. This can receive only a slight luminescence emanating from the Rosh. The ten Sefirot that emerged because of a Zivug de Haka’a in the Nikvey Eynaim de SAG are called the ten Sefirot of the world of Nikudim. They descended from the Nikvey Eynaim and took their place under the Tabur de AK. There they split into the Rosh and the Guf. The place, below which the Ohr Hochma cannot spread, is called “the Parsa”. The world of the Nikudim is called “the outer part”. The inner Sefirot are called the Partzufim MA and BON of the world of AK. So why did Tzimtzum Bet take place? The fact is that when the Neku- dot de SAG , which are actually the Zat de Bina ( Zat means “Zain Tachtonot” – seven lower Sefirot ), i.e., the vessels, which ZA and Malchut turn to for the light and which are ready to transfer that light downwards, de- scended under Tabur. They also encountered the NHYM of Galgalta – the enormous desires of Dalet/Gimel that, with regard to their properties,are close to Dalet de Dalet , i.e., to the Essence of the Creation. The Nekudot de SAG adopted the desires of the NHYM de Galgalta . However, they did not have the appropriate screen; hence, Nekudot de SAG ran the danger of receiving the light for their own pleasure. To avert this, Malchut , which had made TA , rose to Tifferet (i.e., Bina de Guf ), thus Bina de Guf ), thus Bina de Guf cutting the vessels of reception off from the vessels of bestowal. Now the Nekudot de SAG will not be able to receive delight for their own sake. This is the Tzimtzum Bet . There are the ten Sefirot KaHaB, HaGaT, and NHYM in Malchut of the world of Infinity. After TA, it is possible to use the first nine Sefirot in order to receive as much light for the Creator’s sake as the strength of the screen allows. Only Malchut cannot receive the Direct Light.It has just the Ohr Hozer (the Surrounding Light). Ohr Hozer (the Surr ounding Light). Ohr Hozer"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 260 The Tzimtzum Bet puts forward additional conditions. Now it is impossible to receive the Ohr Hochma, even for the sake of the Creator . Malchut can only give, receiving the Ohr Hassadim, the pleasure from the equivalence of its properties with those of the Creator. If a ban is imposed on two or three desires, a Zivug de Aka’a is not made on them. They are not taken into account but remain unused. Let us review the interaction between the qualities of judgment and mercy. During the rise of Malchut to Bina, the latter was restricted. How do we know that Malchut received so-called sweetening (the qual- ity of mercy)? Is not the purpose of this action to provide Malchut ( Din ) with the qualities of mercy, and not vice versa, to give Bina (mercy) the property of judgment? To answer this question, let us give an example that demonstrates how Malchut received the sweetening by way of TB. The sages said: “In the beginning, the Creator thought to create the world by the quality of judgment, but saw that it cannot exist, and added the property of mercy”. That world is Malchut , which restricted itself (the expression of the quality of judgment). Nevertheless, there are always Sefirot in each Partzuf , although Partzuf , although Partzuf Malchut made the Restriction on itself. Malchut does not yet have a complete Partzuf . However, the Cre- Partzuf . Ho w ev er , the Cr e- Partzuf ator’s desire is to make it a full Partzuf so that it will receive the direct Partzuf so that it will r eceiv e the dir ect Partzuf Light into its Kelim as before the Restriction. We have learned that the place for such correction is Malchut de ZA of the world of Atzilut . Then it separates from ZA and becomes an independent Partzuf - Malchut of the world of Atzilut . As in all the other Partzufim , Malchut ascended to Bina in ZA , i.e., its Malchut rose to its ZA called “Chazeh” . NHY fell into the power of NHY f ell int o the po w er of NHY Malchut from the Chazeh and downwards. It turns out that, owing to the rise of Malchut to Bina , ZA restricted itself; i.e., it does not use all of its ten Sefirot , but only down to the Chazeh (Bina de Guf) ."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 261 Then, thanks to a Zivug AB-SAG, TB was cancelled and Malchut re- Malchut r e - Malchut turned to its place. The Kelim NHY were purified, so Kelim NHY w e r e p u r i f i e d , s o Kelim NHY ZA can use them ZA c a n u s e t h e m ZA again. Here we see something quite new! Since nothing disappears in the spiritual world, we find that Malchut is still up with Malchut i s s t i l l u p w i t h Malchut NHY under its power. NHY u n d e r i t s p o w e r . NHY However, by canceling the TB, the Zivug AB-SAG does not lower Malchut . Therefore, Malchut acquired the Kelim de NHY, thanks to the Gad- lut de ZA, and included them in itself. These Kelim refer to the Direct Light, called “sparks of the “desire to bestow””. Although they have no connection with Malchut , these vessels fell into it (the “desire to receive” for itself), so now it is able to bestow. These NHY split into nine parts, joined NHY split int o nine par ts, joined NHY Malchut in its upper posi- tion and formed the Partzuf Malchut . Now we see that, if it were not for TB , Malchut would have been totally unable to build its own Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf A calculation is made in the Rosh that only the first three Sefirot are the vessels of reception and can therefore be used. The lower, receiv- ing vessels, i.e., Sefirot from Malchut up to the middle of Tifferet, cannot be used. A Zivug de Haka’a occurs only from mid- Tifferet and above. A similar action takes place in the Guf : I can use only Guf : I can use only Guf Sefirot from Keter to Keter t o Keter mid- Tifferet . The rest of the desires remain empty. This is TB . It indicates that it is only possible to give for the Creator’s sake, but not to receive. The Masach de Rosh rose from the Peh to the Nikvey Eynaim ; now only the vessels of bestowal above the screen can be used. There is no screen on the receiving desires, but it is possible to prevent these desires from receiving selfishly. They are just neutralized, ignored; only the de- sires of bestowal are worked with. The state of the Partzuf working only Partzuf w or king only Partzuf with the desires of bestowal is called “Katnut” (small state), since it uses only the giving vessels. The state, when the Partzuf , having acquired anti-egoistic powers, Partzuf , ha ving acq uir ed anti-egois tic po w er s, Partzuf will be able to receive the light in its vessels of reception and work with all ten desires, is called “Gadlut” (big state). Here a question arises: how can the tenth desire – Malchut, receive? Was it not impossible even before"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 262 TB ? It can be done with the help of the AHP de Aliyah and “the three lines”. But we will discuss this later. Only the giving vessels (GE) are above the screen; below it are the vessels of reception (AHP) , with which it does not work while in the state of Katnut . The GE de Rosh fills the GE de Toch , while no part of the AHP goes into the AHP de Toch . Our body is designed in the image and likeness of the spiritual Partzuf . There is a dividing line – the diaphragm – which separates the re- Partzuf . Ther e is a dividing line – the diaphr agm – whic h separ at es the r e- Partzuf spiratory system from the digestive. The respiratory system corresponds to the giving vessels, the digestive – to the vessels of reception. Therefore, the letter Aleph , the first one in the Hebrew alphabet, consists of a slanting line – diaphragm – above which the upper letter Yud represents GE , and the lower – AHP . In fact, it is only after the TB the creation takes a definite form. Hence the letter Aleph embodies the beginning of this process. When desires appear in man, he decides which of them he can or cannot use. This means that the screen is being created in him, and he starts working with it. What does it mean to wish to bestow without receiving anything in return. This is Bina, the Behina Bet . It says it does not want to receive anything, since it understands that pleasure distances it from the Creator. It prefers not to receive at all in order to be closer to Him. It enjoys giving. We can receive pleasure either from reception or from giving, which is in fact also a kind of recep- tion. It enjoys being close to the Creator. The Partzuf SAG does not receive anything either. Then why does it have a Rosh, Toch , and a Sof ? Why does it make a Sof ? W h y d o e s i t m a k e a Sof Zivug de Haka’a ? On the face of it, only the Ohr Hassadim has to spread inside it. Yet it is not so. The Ohr Hassadim is an enormous pleasure of being similar to the Creator, from closeness to Him, from sharing the information that is in Him."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 263 One gets to know His thoughts, feelings, attain whatever is in Him; one reaches the same level. It brings tremendous delight, which must also be provided with the screen, so that it would be felt in an altruistic way. SAG cannot receive all the pleasures, hence it makes a Zivug in the Zivug in the Zivug Rosh and has the Toch ; the Sof , however, cannot be filled. Sof , ho w ev er , canno t be f illed. Sof Actually, the creation cannot have the vessels of bestowal. The cre- ation is Malchut after the TA , i.e., the vessel of reception. This Malchut places the screen of this or that power and acts accordingly as Keter, Ho- chma, Bina, ZA, or Malchut . So, a part of these vessels of reception, that is Keter, Hochma, and Gar de Bina , which are equipped with the appropriate screen, can be used as the vessels of bestowal. If the pure bestowal (this is only the Creator) existed, the creation would not be able to feel it at all, since it can only feel something that enters it. The upper Partzuf always gives birth to the lower one because it Partzuf alw a y s giv es bir th t o the lo w er one because it Partzuf retains the Reshimot . The light filled Malchut of the World of Infinity and transferred all its powers and properties to it. Because of this, Malchut passionately desires to be like it and is ready to sacrifice everything to expel the light and to remain empty. The strength of this desire drives the entire creation from the be- ginning to the very end – the Gmar Tikkun . All that happens to the creation ( Malchut’s desire to correct itself and become similar to the Cre- ator) finds its reflection after the TA. In addition, Malchut has strength for that, since it was filled with the light that passed it its properties. The higher state fully determines and gives rise to the lower, which is itself on a lower level. For instance, what is the difference between Galgalta and AB ? It consists in the fact that AB works for the Creator with less power. Nevertheless, both of them use the egoistic Kelim for His sake. The SAG is already unable to do that, for its screen is weaker than that of AB ; like Bina , it can only refuse to receive anything. By receiving nothing, ignoring its receiving vessels, it can fill with the Ohr Hassadim"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 264 those desires that no other Partzufim could. As was stated, there was no Tzimtzum on the Ohr Hassadim ; hence, the Partzuf SAG can descend un- der the Tabur . Then it creates the world of Nikudim and afterwards – the world of Atzilut . Bina ( SAG ) , is the first and only desire of the creation that sets everything in motion. The Behinat Shoresh is the Creator’s “desire to bestow” delight upon the created beings. The Behina Aleph is the cre- ation created by the Creator. Only the Behina Bet, Bina, is the creation’s reaction, its desire to be like Him. Henceforth, this property of Bina determines the direction of the entire creation’s evolution, right up to the Final Correction. SAG spread as the Nekudot both above the Tabur de Galgalta and below it. The Partzufim MA Elion and BON Elion emerged from the Reshi- mot de SAG above the Tabur . The SAG makes a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimot that rose from under the Tabur de Galgalta and creates a Partzuf called the Partzuf called the Partzuf world of Nikudim . The SAG was imbued with the desires Dalet/Gimel under the Tabur and wished to fill them. Tabur and wished t o f ill them. Tabur Imagine that you have both the desire to give and to receive. Gener- ally speaking, the creation does not have the altruistic desires to give; it was created out of pure egoism, the desire to receive pleasure. However, it is possible to enjoy the reception of the Ohr Hochma , i.e., directly re- ceiving delight (the Creator’s light), and the reception of the light of Hassadim , i.e., enjoying the similarity of one’s properties to those of the Creator. We therefore define two desires of the creation: to receive and to give. Actually, the Creator created only one desire – to receive. When man works only with his “desire to give”, he restricts all his egoistic desires and is in the state of Katnut . How can this state be called forth? If all man’s egoistic desires are bigger than his screen, there is noth- ing else for him to do but to refrain from using them as the vessels of reception. All of us are in such a state. The only thing we can do is not"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 265 activate all our egoistic desires, ignore them. This state is called “Ubar” (embryo). Malchut is the “desire to receive” for the sake of reception, a purely egoistic desire. If all man’s desires are imbued only with this intention, it means that Malchut rose to Bina , i.e., it rules over all of its desires from Bina and below it. This is the Tzimtzum Bet . We cannot correct independently such desires in ourselves. The only thing we can do is to work in a group under the guidance of a Teacher and study authentic, reliable sources of Kabbalistic knowledge. By introducing necessary efforts into such studies, we can attract the Creator’s light, His influence, His sensation, all of which will help us to acquire anti-egoistic power, i.e., the screen. As much as we can withstand our egoism, we will be able to feel the Creator; we will acquire the intention to work for His sake. The law states that when the smaller Partzuf begins to feel the higher one, it ac- Partzuf begins t o f eel the higher one, it ac- Partzuf quires the desire, the intention, to do everything for it. If we still lack such desire, it is only because we cannot feel the higher Partzuf . The Creator conceals Himself from us, since egoism rules Partzuf . The Cr eat or conceals Himself fr om us, since egoism rule s Partzuf over us, suppresses altruism, and makes us feel our independence. How- ever, when He is revealed, we will instantly become His slaves. To trans- form some of my qualities, I primarily need to realize they are harmful to me, and then ask the Creator to make them altruistic. This process is called “the realization of evil”. All our studies are based on it. We are either slaves of our own egoism or the Creator’s slaves. The main thing is to understand what is preferable. Freedom consists in the ability independently to choose one or the other. The sensations of suffering determine man’s behavior. The Creator provided a mother with the desire to nurture her child and to do everything for it. To some people, He gives the ability to feel the sufferings of others. Nevertheless, overall, everyone suffers from being unable to satisfy his egoistic desires."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 266 דראש עינים מנקבי ויצאו נאצלו ק \" דא ה \" והמ דנקודים ס \" שהע כיון , להבין יש אמנם ( סא שכל , הקודמים בפרצופים ש \" כמ , ולמטה דראשו מפה ג \" להס להלביש צריכים היו הנה , ג \" הס . ולמטה דראש מפה לעליונו מלביש תחתון , זה את להבין ובכדי ? ק \" דא מטבור שלמטה במקום להלביש שירדו אלא , כן היה לא ולמה ? לאחת נתחברו והמלכות שהבינה , ל \" הנ השיתוף נתהווה איך , היטב לידע צריכים 61) It is necessary to understand that, since the 10 Sefirot of the world of the Nikudim and MA of the world of AK emerged from Nikvey Eynaim de SAG (the boundary between the “giving” and “receiving” vessels – Gar and Zat de Bina), they had to dress SAG from Peh de Rosh and below. This is similar to the way all previous Partzufim emerged – each lower Partzuf dresses onto the upper one from the Peh de Rosh and downwards. , הפנימי ק \" דא מטבור למעלה כולו נסתיים הוא , ג \" ס פרצוף יציאת בעת כי , הוא והענין ( סב שליטת מתחלת שם כי . ולמטה מטבור להתפשט יכלו לא כי , ק \" דא ב \" ע בפרצוף שנתבאר כמו ולא ד \" מבחי בהם אין ג \" ס ב \" ע ובפרצופי , שלה דסיום ס \" ע בבחינת הפנימי ק \" דא ד \" הבחי .( ד \" נ אות ) כלום שהוא , ג \" דס המסך שנזדכך אחר דהיינו , ק \" דא ג \" דס הנקודות לצאת כשהתחילו אמנם אז הנה , דעביות א \" ובחי דהתלבשות ב \" לבחי ובא , בו מ \" דאו הביטוש י \" ע , דעביות ב \" בחי . ראש בלי ק \" בו , במסך הנשארת העביות על הנקודות קומת ויצאה , ג \" דס הטעמים נסתלקו ב \" בחי שהוא , הזכר בקומת וגם . ר \" ג בחסר א \" ז קומת הן דעביות א \" בחי על היוצאות ס \" הע כי . דבינה ק \" לו נבחן שהוא , בקירוב אלא בינה בחינת שם אין , דהתלבשות שגם , ק \" דא מטבור שלמטה דסיום ס \" הע עם צורתה נשתוה , ג \" דס דנקודות זו קומה ולפיכך כ \" וע . לאחד הרוחניים מקרבת הצורה שהשתוות ונודע .( ב \" נ אות ) ראש בלי ק \" ו בבחינת הן להיותם , יחד כאחד ושמשו , ק \" דא ן \" הזו עם שם ונתערבה , ק \" דא מטבור למטה זו קומה ירדה . קומה בשיעור שוים 62) The fact is that when the Partzuf SAG emerged, as did AB, it ended above the Tabur de Galgalta, because it could not descend below the Tabur, where Behina Dalet de Galgalta rules as the ten Sefirot de Sium. The Partzufim AB and SAG have nothing to do with the Behina Dalet. But when, after the weakening of the Masach, the Nekudot de SAG began to emerge from the Bet de Aviut and the Gimel de Hitlabshut"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 267 to the Aleph de Aviut and the Bet de Hitlabshut and the Ta’amim de SAG disappeared, then the level of the Nekudot de VAK (six Sefirot) appeared, i.e., ZA without the first three Sefirot. There is no Ohr Hochma there, only the Ohr Hassadim. This state completely corresponds to the property of the ten Sefirot de Sium below the Tabur, which are also in the state of VAK. We know that the equivalence of properties in the spiritual world unites them into one. Therefore, the Nekudot de SAG descended under the Tabur and merged with ZON (ZA and Malchut) of the world of AK. We should remember, that the “Nekudot de SAG” do not refer to Bina , which does not wish to receive the Ohr Hochma . All we speak about is no more than Malchut ! Malchut is called “Bina” , since it knows that it will not be able to withstand the pleasure of the Ohr Hochma ; hence it does not want to subject itself to temptation; it is not interested in the light of Hochma , only in the light of Hassadim . Let us examine the notion “raising MAN ”. MAN stands for MAN s t ands f or MAN “Mey Nukvin” , the plural of the words Maim (water) and Nukvin (female). Be- fore merging, Bina and Behina Dalet existed separately. When Bina de- scended under the Tabur , it was mixed with Malchut ; now there are two kinds of Bina : Bina de Bina and Bina included in Malchut . There are also two kinds of Malchut: Malchut de Malchut and Malchut included in Bina . Bina is known as Maim (water) and the plural of two Malchut – Nukvin – together form “ Mey Nukvin ”. This hints to the fact that, begin- ning from this moment on, with each raising of MAN, Malchut must be sweetened by Bina . Pure Malchut is not called MAN , but the Masach or “the property of judgment”. Many things in this paragraph raise questions, but the Baal Ha- Sulam did not provide all the answers. That was never his goal; he always gave his disciples an opportunity to make an effort to find the required answer."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 268 Our work is in the field of the application of necessary efforts; not in the means to understand the spiritual worlds. Understanding comes only in the measure of our ability to feel the Creator. When man’s prop- feel the Cr eat or . When man’s pr op- feel erty is similar to the property of the Creator, it turns into the spiritual vessel of reception, with the help of which man can sense spiritual infor- mation. The Creator reveals Himself only after man applies a sufficient quantity and quality of efforts. If you simply memorize the text, and re- member that Nekudot de SAG descends under the Tabur and mixes with Tabur and mix es with Tabur NHYM de Galgalta , it will be enough for your further advancement. The facts must be rooted well in your head. This information does not vanish with biological death. באו ג \" דס הנקודות כי , שבהם העביות מצד רב מרחק ביניהם יש עדיין הרי : להקשות ואין ( סג לקומת דומה עוד זה אין , א \" ז קומת שהם והגם ? כלום ולא ד \" מבחי בהם ואין , ב \" דבחי מעביות ? גדול הפרש בהם שיש הרי , ד \" דבחי א \" ז שהוא , ק \" דא מטבור הלמטה של א \" ז . האור הסתלקות אחר רק , האור התלבשות בעת בפרצוף ניכרת העביות אין כי , היא התשובה שמטבור ן \" זו בקומת ונתלבש ירד , א \" ז בקומת ג \" דס הנקודות פרצוף שהופיע בעת כ \" וע חדש סיום שנעשה ,' הב לצמצום וגרם , בזה זה ד \" בהבחי ב \" הבחי נתערבו ואז , ק \" דא ולמטה במקום דראש הפה ונעשה , הזווג מקום להשתנות גרם וכן . ההוא פרצוף של דגוף בינה במקום . העינים נקבי 63) However, we must understand that there is a significant distinc- tion between the Nekudot de SAG and the NHYM de Galgalta. The Nekudot de SAG have the Behina Bet de Aviut and are totally unconnected with the Behina Dalet, which is below the Tabur, al- though both of them are on the level of ZA, but with a different degree of the Aviut. The fact is that the Aviut does not show in the Partzuf when it is filled with the light that overwhelms the vessel (the desire). However, after the light exits the Partzuf, the necessary Aviut becomes obvious in it.This allows the Nekudot de SAG to descend under the Tabur and be mixed with the NHYM de Galgalta. This led to TB and the formation of a new Sium in the position of Bina de Guf of the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 269 Partzuf. The place of the Zivug also changed; Malchut moved from the Peh de Rosh to the Nikvey Eynaim. It is written that there is a similarity of properties between the Nekudot de SAG and the ZON de AK , since both of them make up the Partzuf VAK (Katnut) . The level of the Partzuf SAG is Bet-Aleph , which is defined as VAK . However, the ZON de AK are ZON de AK ar e ZON de AK VAK due to a different rea- VAK due t o a dif f er ent r ea- VAK son. It is not according to their height, which is Dalet-Gimel, but because they are under the Tabur – the ten Tabur – the t en Tabur Sefirot of Sium de Partzuf . So what is the Sium de Partzuf . So what is the Sium de Partzuf similarity between these Partzufim ? The Partzuf Galgalta is called “inner AK ”; it has the inner HaVaYaH (the unutterable four-letter name of the Creator – Yud, Hey, Vav, Hey – the base of any Kli ). This means that it is divided according to a certain order, regardless of the height of the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf The head is called Keter and is Keter and is Keter Kotzo (the beginning) of the letter Yud . From the Peh to the Chazeh is Hochma ,the Yud of the name Ha- VaYaH ; from the Chazeh to the Tabur is Tabur is Tabur Bina , the first Hey of HaVaYaH ; from the Tabur downwards are Tabur do wn w ar ds ar e Tabur MA and BON , the letters Vav and Hey of the name HaVaYaH ; they are VAK . According to this order, it turns out that their height is the same, i.e., both of them are VAK and have VAK and ha v e VAK the light of Hassadim with the luminescence of Hochma ; not, however, because they are Vav and Hey , but because these are the ten Sefirot of Sium de Partzuf . Sium de Partzuf . Sium de Partzuf למטה רק נעשה ,\"' ב צמצום \" הנקרא , בבינה המלכות של השיתוף שמקור , מוצא והנך ( סד זו ס \" ע קומת יכלה לא ולפיכך . שמה ג \" דס נקודות פרצוף התפשטות י \" ע , ק \" דא מטבור יכול ושליטה כח שום אין כי , ק \" דא מטבור למעלה להתפשט ,' ב מצמצום הבאה , דנקודים , ולמטה מהטבור התחיל ' ב הצמצום התהוות שמקום ומתוך . יציאתו ממקור למעלה להתגלות . שם להתפשט הנקודים קומת גם הוכרחה כ \" ע 64) It turns out that the source of the interaction between Malchut and Bina (TB) became apparent only below the Tabur of the world of AK, when the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG spread there. Hence, the ten Sefirot of the world of Nikudim that emerged according to the laws"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 270 of TB could not spread above the Tabur de AK, because nothing can manifest above its source, its root. Since TB rules from the Tabur and below it, the world of Nikudim was bound to spread there as well. As in all the other Partzufim affected by the impact between the Inner and the Surrounding Lights, the screen of the Partzuf SAG began losing strength and rising to the Peh de Rosh . Because of this intermediate state, the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG began to take form. It has the Reshimot Bet/Bet , i.e., constitutes pure Bina . Hence, it can spread anywhere, in- cluding under the Tabur of Tabur of Tabur Galgalta , and fill the desires that the previous Partzufim could not. The Nekudot de SAG can use their desires in a way that neither the Galgalta (it used only 20% for the Creator’s sake above the Tabur , restricting the remaining desires, NHYM, under the Tabur de Galgalta ), nor SAG could. The SAG could not receive for the Creator’s sake at all. It can only bestow without receiving anything. If it starts receiving, the reception will be egoistic. It has no screen on its egoistic desires. Why does the SAG not immediately descend under the Tabur ? It is because the SAG has Gimel de Hitlabshut , a slight luminescence of the Ohr Hochma , which does not allow it to descend under the Tabur . When the Masach rises to the Peh de Rosh and the Gimel de Hitlabshut disappears, leaving only the Bet de Hitlabshut (pure Bina without Ohr Hochma ), the Nekudot de SAG can descend under the Tabur , refuse to receive anything in their Kelim and wish to enjoy giving, i.e., receive the Ohr Hassadim . This is the work of pure Bina. When it descends under the Tabur, the SAG encounters desires that it cannot resist. The Galgalta and AB also refuse to receive anything under the Tabur , but in addition to the Ohr Hassadim there was some lu- minescence of the Ohr Hochma , which they received in their Kelim above the Tabur for the Creator’s sake. Tabur f or the Cr eat or’s sak e. Tabur"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 271 The Nekudot de SAG , which by nature do not want to receive any- thing and by their structure are similar to the NHYM de Galgalta , begin to mix with them. However, seeing the luminescence of the Ohr Hochma , which brings enormous pleasure, they suddenly “desire to receive” that delight, although they have no screen for it; hence, they are totally unfit to receive. The law of TA instantly snaps into action, preventing the light from entering the egoistic vessels. As a result, the light disappears from them, and Malchut of the World of Infinity rises to Bina and restricts the reception of the light in the receiving vessels. This is how the Tzimtzum Bet (the Second Restriction, TB ) takes place. Even the SAG could not use its egoistic vessels for the Creator’s sake. More, the subsequent Partzufim, MA and BON , which do not have the appropriate screen, will not be able to receive anything for the sake of the Creator. The Tzimtzum Bet makes the use of the egoistic Kelim impossible. They are forbidden to be used and must be isolated. Only the altruistic Kelim are worked with . When such information rises to the Rosh de SAG , the structure of the future Partzuf is planned there in advance, taking Partzuf is planned ther e in advance, t aking Partzuf into consideration the Tzimtzum Bet . Then a Zivug is made, not in the Zivug is made, no t in the Zivug Peh de Rosh , but in the Nikvey Eynaim . From this point and above there are only the desires of bestowal. The same calculation must be made in the Guf of the Guf of the Guf Partzuf , where Partzuf , wher e Partzuf the light can enter only the vessels of KaHaB HaGaT , i.e., up to the middle of Tifferet . In fact, in the Rosh and in the Guf, the same 10 Sefirot remain; only the level on which they are used changes. This means that each Sefira – Keter, Hochma, Bina etc. – is used not up to 100%, but only up to 60%. Now, we say that a Zivug is made only in Zivug is made only in Zivug GE, KaHaB HaGaT . However, these are mere terms. It is possible to use the AHP, i.e., the vessels of reception, only if they are referred to as the vessels of bestowal, “raising” them above the"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 272 boundary between the receiving and the giving vessels , i.e. the Parsa. However, despite the fact that the AHP are now considered as vessels AHP ar e no w consider ed as v essels AHP of bestowal and fit to receive only the Ohr Hassadim , the ascended AHP naturally and automatically attract a slight luminescence of the Ohr Ho- chma . This process is called the “ AHP de Aliyah ” – the ascent of egoistic desires; in other words, they achieve their correction by merging with the upper Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf The Masach that stands at the Peh de Rosh of the Galgalta had the Aviut Dalet and made a Zivug on all the desires. However, only 20 % of Zivug on all the desir es. Ho w ev er , only 20 % of Zivug each of them is used for the Creator, while 80 % do not take part in the reception for the Creator’s sake. The anti-egoistic force in the screen is not sufficient for them. Only altruistic vessels placed above the Nikvey Eynaim are used in the Nekudot de SAG after the Tzimtzum Bet , because they have the “desire to give” for the sake of bestowal. The entire universe represents one cause-and-effect chain that be- gan from the first state when Malchut of the World of Infinity was com- pletely filled with the light and up to its final correction when it will be filled with the light again. This process is controlled with the help of the Reshimot . Starting from the World of Infinity, Malchut gradually sorts out all its delights and builds a screen on them. It then leaves Reshimot from each of the previous states, up to its final correction. The Reshimot alone determine the birth of the next Partzuf from Partzuf fr om Partzuf the previous one. It is just this information about the past that provides the possibility to work with the screen. Only the light that filled the previous Partzuf can give to the next Partzuf can giv e t o the ne xt Partzuf Partzuf the information about the Partzuf the inf ormation about the Partzuf pleasure and desires that were in it, and then pass them on to the next. Otherwise, there would be no idea about the light or the pleasure. The Reshimot in the Partzuf make it desire, seek, and move towards something Partzuf mak e it desir e, seek , and mo v e t o w ar ds some thing Partzuf new. We merely follow the instructions of our Reshimot . There are no concepts such as 'was', 'is', or 'will be' existing sepa- rately in the spiritual world. These three concepts are already included in each new spiritual state. The Reshimo is a state in which I exist, but it"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 273 shines from afar, attracting me from the future, arousing the desire to reach it. This light, which was inside the vessel, left and is now shining upon it from outside. There are many kinds of Reshimot ; they are reminders of what was inside each Partzuf . Unlike Partzuf . U nlik e Partzuf Reshimot , the Ohr Makif is the light that has not yet entered the vessel, but is shining upon it from outside. After the expulsion of the light from each Partzuf, lots of spiritual information re- mains around it. Meanwhile, we need only a tiny picture of the creation, some clear idea of the spiritual worlds. Everything around is in the state of absolute peace. Although one must try to read what is written with understanding, a person should not take it as an assessment of his state: where he is now, where he is going, what he should do. Only the quantity and quality of efforts can be the criterion, for only they promote spiritual growth. Only your efforts can reveal the Creator, not your knowledge. Nevertheless, knowledge is also necessary, though minimal. If you understand that your work, family, children and, of course, the studies are needed for achieving only one Goal – revealing the Cre- ator – all these are counted as your efforts. Whatever you do in life, whatever you study, everything must remind you about the Purpose of the creation. This leads accordingly to the accumulation of efforts that reach the necessary result."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 274 T H E P L A C E O F T H E F O U R W O R L D S A B Y A A N D T H E PA R S A B E T W E E N A T Z I L U T A N D B Y A ע \" אבי העולמות ' לד המקום ע \" לבי אצילות שבין הפרסא וענין מטבור שמקומו , ג \" דס נקודות בפרצוף רק נעשה ' הב צמצום של עיקרו שכל , נתבאר והנה ( סה , השינויים אלו שכל ותדע . ז \" דעוה לנקודה ממעל עד דהיינו , רגליו סיום עד ק \" דא ולמטה ומה . ממנו למעלה ולא , ההוא ג \" דס נקודות בפרצוף רק באו , הזה ' הב צמצום בעקבות שנעשו ת \" ת חצי יצאו , הפרצוף שם וסיימה ק \" דא ת \" ת לחצי המלכות עלית י \" שע , למעלה שאמרנו י \" בתנה רק אלא , עצמו ק \" דא י \" בתנה זה נעשה לא , פנוי חלל לבחינת ק \" דא מ \" ונהי התחתון ן \" מ עליית לבחינת רק הללו השנוים נבחנים עצמו ק \" בא אבל . ק \" דא ג \" דס נקודות דפרצוף ק \" בא אבל . בבחינתן דנקודים ס \" לע להאציל כדי , הללו בשינוים נתלבש שהוא , שפירושו , לבד . שינוי שום נעשה לא עצמו 65) Thus it turns out that the essence of the TB was revealed exclu- sively in the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG from the Tabur down to the Sium Reglav above the point of this world (HaOlam Hazeh). Know that all changes called forth by TB happened only in the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG and not above it. As was already said above, because of the ascent of Malchut to mid- Tifferet of the Sefirot de Sof of the world AK, which cut off its vessels of reception at this point, the lower part of Tifferet and the NHYM de Sof de AK turned into an empty space. It happened not in AK, but in the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG de AK. The changes that took place in AK are considered the raising of MAN, which means that AK only performs these changes for creating the ten Sefirot of the world of the Nikudim. There were no changes in AK itself. After TA, Malchut of the World of Infinity, which decided not to receive anything, makes a new decision. It chooses to receive the Ohr Hochma for the Creator’s sake by building the anti-egoistic screen, i.e., by acquiring the intention to receive for the sake of the Creator. The first Zivug de Haka’a and reception of the light are called Galgalta , the second – AB and the third – SAG . All the above-mentioned Partzufim could"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 275 receive the light only above the Tabur de Galgalta . This is because the desires beneath the Tabur are so egoistic that they can only be ignored. Tabur ar e so egois tic that the y can only be ignor ed. Tabur When the screen of Partzuf SAG weakens and Nekudot de SAG (the Partzuf of pure Partzuf of pur e Partzuf Bina ) emerge, they can fill those desires under the Tabur de Galgalta with Ohr Hassadim , which neither Galgalta , AB , nor SAG could fill. The Nekudot de SAG want nothing for themselves; they receive plea- sure only from giving, i.e., from Ohr Hassadim . Hence, the Nekudot de SAG can refuse to work with its vessels of reception, and fill the desires with Ohr Hassadim instead. But as soon as the desires under the Tabur are filled with the Tabur ar e f illed with the Tabur Ohr Hassadim , it turns out that there are Zat de Bina in Nekudot de SAG , i.e., the lower part that connects Bina with ZA, and obliges it to fulfill ZA's request for the Ohr Hochma . For that, Bina needs to receive this light, although by nature it desires not to receive at all. This quality of Zat de Bina became apparent already during the formation of the four Behinot de Ohr Yashar , where Bina, at the end of its development, decides to re- ceive a little of the Ohr Hochma in order to create ZA . For that purpose, Bina had to restrict slightly its desire not to re- ceive and create in itself the “desire to receive”, but only for the sake of giving, that it may be somewhat similar to the Creator. Now, having met with the enormous desires to receive, Bina ( the Nekudot de SAG) had to submit to them and pass them some Ohr Hochma , which it has to request from above. Such tremendous, newly acquired desires (Dalet/Gimel) are incom- parably greater than the strength of the screen of the Nekudot de SAG ; hence, there is a hazard that the Nekudot de SAG would receive the light for their own sake. To avert this, Malchut of the World of Infinity, which earlier decided to make TA , ascends from the Sium de Galgalta , where it was so far, to mid- Tifferet of the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG , thus cutting off the vessels of reception – the lower part of Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 276 Malchut , thereby restricting their use. Why are these particular Sefirot separated? The upper Sefirot Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, and the up- per part of Tifferet, are by nature vessels of bestowal; therefore, they did not take on the desires of the NHYM de Galgalta (Dalet/Gimel). Only the TNHYM of Nekudot de SAG , albeit similar vessels with smaller Aviut, reacted to them. Recall that the NHYM de Galgalta have the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel , while Nekudot de SAG is a transition from Reshimot Bet/Bet to Bet/Aleph . The upper light can pass through Galgalta, AB, SAG , descend un- der the Tabur , pass through Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura and the upper half of Tifferet, i.e., the light can reach Malchut , which is now at mid- Tifferet . The light cannot descend under Malchut , because of the egoistic desires that remain in absolute emptiness and darkness. In this manner, Malchut divided Nekudot de SAG into the vessels of bestowal that are above it and the vessels of reception that are below it. The line that separates them is called “Parsa” . Any kind of light, including Ohr Hochma , can be above that line, for that is where the giving vessels or GE are. This is the place where the world of Atzilut will later emerge. This world of Atzilut is completely altruistic; it will rule over the en- tire creation, create the worlds BYA, the Partzuf of Adam HaRishon , and facilitate its “sin” and consequent breaking into six hundred thousand souls. Afterwards, it will begin correcting all the broken vessels; it will lift them up to their Final Correction (the Gmar Tikkun ) during 6000 years-levels. The second half of Tifferet, i.e., Zat de Bina that lies under the Parsa , has the properties of Bina; therefore, the future world of Beria (Bina) will be formed in its place. Below it, in the place of Netzah, Hod and Yesod , the world of Yetzira will emerge, and the world of Yetzira - in the place of Malchut ."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 277 This is the general scheme of the creation of the worlds. Mean- while, we have learned that the notion of “place” has nothing to do with our everyday physical definition. By \"place\", we mean the Nekudot de SAG from the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Sium de Galgalta that are divided by the Parsa into the places of Atzilut and BYA . We should also note such properties of the future worlds as ascent and descent. Indeed, their place may ascend and descend with them or re- main where it is. The worlds always go up or down together with the souls. והזווג ן \" מ העלית מטרם עוד , לבינה המלכות עלית בעת דהיינו , הצמצום בעת תיכף והנה ( סו . א : חלוקות ' לד ק \" דא ג \" דס הנקודות פרצוף שיתחלק זה גרם , ק \" דא עינים בנקבי שנעשה סיום עד ולמטה שמחזה ת \" ת ש \" ב . ב , אצילות למקום הנבחנים , שלו החזה עד ת \" חג ב \" כח . ד , היצירה עולם למקום שנעשה , שלו י \" נה הספירות ' ג . ג , בריאה למקום שנעשה , ת \" הת . העשיה עולם למקום שנעשה , שבו המלכות 66) The division of the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG happened already during the TB (ascent of Malchut to Bina), i.e., before the raising of MAN and the Zivug made in the Nikvey Eynaim of the Rosh de SAG. This division occurred in the following way: Keter, Ho- chma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, and the upper third of Tifferet, down to its Chazeh, is the place of Atzilut; two thirds of Tifferet, from the Chazeh to the end of Tifferet, is the place of Beria; Netzah, Hod and Yesod is the place of Yetzira; and Malchut is the place of Assiya. . העליון אור להתפשטות הראוי המקום פירושו , אצילות עולם מקום כי , הוא הדברים וטעם ( סז . הפרצוף שם מסתיים נמצא , ת \" ת הנקרא , דגוף בינה למקום המסיימת המלכות עלית ומתוך . החזה על ת \" ת בחצי שם נסתיים האצילות שמקום הרי . ולמטה משם לעבור יכול האור ואין . האצילות עולם שמתחת ,\" פרסא \" בשם נקרא , כאן שנעשה הזה החדש שסיום , ידעת וכבר היו לא באמת כי , מטעם והוא . חלוקות ' ג בהם יש , מהפרסא למטה שהן , הספירות ובאלו שהסיום מאחר כי . מ \" נהי הנקרא , דגופא ן \" זו הספירות ' ב רק מהאצילות למטה לצאת צריכים , מהסיום למטה שהם , ת \" מת שלמטה ן \" הזו רק נמצאים , ת \" ת שהוא , דגופא בהבינה נעשה דגוף הבינה כי , הוא והטעם . מסיום למטה כ \" ג יצא התחתון ת \" ת חצי גם אמנם . ת \" הת ולא , הכוללים דגוף ן \" הזו של שרשים הם דבינה הללו ן \" שהזו ומתוך . ן \" זו ב \" כח ס \" מע כ \" ג נכללת . כמוהם נחשבים הם , בהבינה שנכללו"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 278 67) The place of the world of Atzilut is assigned to the spreading of the Upper Light down to Tifferet, where the Partzuf ends, i.e., the place of the ascent of Malchut Mesayemet to Bina, below which the light cannot enter. Thus, the place of the world of Atzilut ends in the Chazeh, i.e., at the boundary between the upper third of Tifferet and the lower two thirds of it. The new frontier, called the Parsa, is below the world of Atzilut. Below the Parsa, the place was divided into three parts, although it was to be divided only into two: the ZON de Guf (ZA and Nukva) of NHY. Nevertheless, after a new Sium emerged in Bina de Guf (or Tifferet), only the ZON is below it. However, two thirds of Tifferet also descended under the Parsa. The fact is that Bina de Guf (Tiffer- et) in turn consists of its ten Sefirot KaHaB and ZON; and since ZON de Bina is the root of the ZON de Guf, ZON de Bina already possesses properties similar to those of ZON. It means that they already have the “desire to receive”, not for themselves, but for passing the light down to the ZON . זה ומטעם . הכוללים ן \" הזו עם ביחד דאצילות מהפרסא למטה דבינה ן \" הזו גם יצאו כ \" וע ומוציאה , שם עומדת לבינה שעלתה המלכות כי . החזה במקום לרחבה ת \" הת ספירת נסדקה . סיומו עד ולמטה שמחזה ת \" הת ש \" ב שהם , לחוץ דבינה ן \" הזו את גם יצאו ולא , דגוף להבינה באמת שייכים ת \" ת ש \" הב כי . מ \" נהי לבין ת \" ת ש \" ב בין הפרש יש ז \" ועכ , בהם גדול הפגם אין לכן . ן \" הזו שורשי שהם מפני רק , עצמם מחמת האצילות מסיום למטה הנקרא והוא , עצמו בפני לעולם ונעשו מ \" מהנהי נבדלו כ \" וע . עצמם מחמת יציאתם אין כי .\" הבריאה עולם \" Hence, together with the ZON de Guf, the ZON de Bina is also under the Parsa. For this reason, Sefira Tifferet split in all its width in Chazeh de Partzuf, since Malchut, which rose to Bina, stands there, leaving the ZON de Bina (two thirds of Sefira Tifferet below the Chazeh) outside (under the Parsa). That explains the distinction between the upper part of Tifferet above the Parsa, which refers exclusively to Bina, and the lower part"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 279 of Tifferet (ZON), which is under the Parsa against its will. It is the root of the real ZON and in the future will have to provide them with the light. There is not much evil in it, since it emerged not by its free choice. It separated from the NHYM (actual ZON), positioned below it, and formed the world of Beria. , נוקבא בחינת להיותה המלכות כי . בחינות ' לב כ \" ג נתחלקו , ם \" נהי הנקרא , דגוף ן \" הזו גם ( סח לעולם נעשה , י \" נה שהוא , א \" והז . העשיה עולם למקום נעשית והיא , קשה יותר פגמה נמצאת . עשיה מעולם למעלה , היצירה : עולמות ' לד מקום ונעשה ,' ב הצמצום בסבת ג \" דס הנקודות פרצוף נחלק איך , נתבאר והנה לעולם מקום נעשה - שבו החזה עד ת \" חג ב \" הכח אשר . עשיה , יצירה , בריאה , אצילות י \" והנה . הבריאה לעולם מקום נעשה - ת \" הת סיום עד שמחזה התחתון ת \" ת וחצי . אצילות . העשיה לעולם - שלו והמלכות . היצירה לעולם - שבו רגליו סיום עד דהיינו , ז \" עוה לנקודת ממעל ומסתיים ק \" דא הטבור מנקודת מתחיל ומקומם . ק \" דא גלגלתא לפרצוף ג \" דס נקודות פרצוף הלבשת שיעור סוף שהוא , ק \" דא 68) The ZON de Guf also split into two parts: ZA (NHY – Netzah, Hod and Yesod) became the world of Yetzira, while Malchut (or Nukva) formed the world of Assiya under Yetzira. Here we have learned how, because of TB, the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG was divided and the place for the four worlds, Atzilut, Be- ria, Yetzira and Assiya, was formed. Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura and Tifferet down to the Chazeh formed the place for the world of Atzilut. The lower two thirds of Tifferet, from the Chazeh down to the end of Tifferet, formed the place for the world of Beria. Netzah, Hod and Yesod prepared the place for the world of Yetzira and Malchut created the place for the world of Assiya. The common place for all the worlds begins at the point of the Tabur of the world AK and ends above our world, i.e., reaches Sium Reglav de AK where the dressing of the Nekudot de SAG on the Partzuf Galgalta comes to an end. Desires are created by the Creator and cannot be changed. All de- sires are created as Malchut of the World of Infinity. One can only decide"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 280 how and when to apply them. Each desire can be used, worked with, or left aside until better times. If you can do it, you are called “man” in the spiritual sense of the word and means that you already have the screen. You are the master of your actions and desires. If, with the help of the screen, you can use some of your desires, then depending on the strength of your screen, you may fill them with the Creator’s light. The desires are called the vessel of your soul; the light is called the light of the soul. The soul constitutes those desires you work with for the sake of the Creator. The filled vessel is like the soul. TA was aimed neither at restricting the use of desires nor at neu- tralizing them. We have no power over that. We always want something. The restriction was made only on receiving for one’s sake, whereas one can receive for the Creator’s sake at any time. Malchut, from the Peh to the Tabur, began receiving the Ohr Hochma for the sake of the Creator in the desires that were there. The ten Sefirot of Nekudot de SAG are under the Tabur . The Parsa divided the Nekudot de SAG into two parts – altruistic and egoistic. The altruistic vessels end in Tifferet de Tifferet. As was stated, we need to understand the material in order to grasp the general picture, the meaning of Kabbalah, to see where it leads us and with what it provides us. How can we start working with a set of our desires? Which of them do I have to begin with? Can I use them? If so, under what conditions may they be used?"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 281 T H E S T A T E S O F K A T N U T A N D G A D L U T I N T H E W O R L D O F N I K U D I M הנקודים בעולם שנתחדש , והגדלות הקטנות ענין לצורך ג \" דס הנקודות בפרצוף שנעשה ,' ב הצמצום ענין כלל בדרך שידעת אחר והנה ( סט ס \" הע יציאת ענין ונבאר נחזור , ק \" דא הרביעי פרצוף שהוא , הנקודים דעולם ס \" הע אצילות ויוצא נולד תחתון פרצוף שכל , מפרצוף פרצוף יציאת ענין נתבאר וכבר . בפרטיות דנקודים להזדככות והגורם , דעליון להפה הזווג להתחדשות ועליתו הזדככותו אחר , דעליון דגוף ממסך אותו ומשווה , שבו דגוף מעביות למסך המזכך , העליון דפרצוף במסך מ \" דאו הביטוש הוא הזה .( ה \" ל אות ) דראש עביות לבחינת ב \" ע מפרצוף ק \" דא ג \" ס פרצוף וכן , ק \" דא הכתר מפרצוף ק \" דא ב \" ע פרצוף יצא זה שבדרך שהוא , שלו מהעליון ויצא נולד , הנקודים דעולם ס \" ע הנקרא , ק \" דא ' הד פרצוף גם והנה . ק \" דא . הדרך באותו כ \" ג , ק \" דא ג \" ס 69) Having acquired some general idea of the TB in the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG, we now proceed to a more detailed analysis of the creation of the ten Sefirot of the world of Nikudim, the fourth Partzuf of the world AK. We already know how one Partzuf takes form out of another. It happens when each lower Partzuf emerges from the Masach de Guf of the upper one, after it loses its strength and rises to the Peh to resume a Zivug de Haka’a. Bitush of the Ohr Makif in the Masach facilitates a loss of the Aviut of Masach de Guf down to Aviut de Rosh. This allows the creation of a new Partzuf from the previous one. In this way, the Partzuf AB (Hochma) emerged from the Partzuf Gal- galta (Keter); similarly, the fourth Partzuf of the world of AK, called the ten Sefirot of the world of Nikudim, emerged from the Partzuf SAG (Bina). This means that, unless the Nekudot de SAG had descended under the Tabur de Galgalta, followed by the TB , the world, or rather, the Partzuf Nikudim, would simply have been the Partzuf ZA of the world of AK . However, the above-mentioned events have resulted in a considerable difference between the Partzuf Nikudim and the previous Partzufim ."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 282 The rising of the Masach de Guf to the Peh de Rosh means that, by its properties, it becomes equal to the screen at Peh de Rosh . As was already said, there are actually no rises or descents in the spiritual world. Kab- balists simply use the notions “ascent”, “descent” and so on, to explain to us the processes that happen there. For example, if I am on a certain level, then provided I have the properties of the higher level, it means that I ascend to it. דראש לפה והעליה המסך הזדככות בעת , הקודמים בפרצופים כי , נוסף ענין כאן יש אמנם ( ע בהזדככות כאן כ \" משא . בלבד העליון דגוף דעביות מהרשימות רק כלול המסך היה לא , דעליון . רשימות מיני ' מב כלול הזה המסך היה , הנקודים לצורך ק \" דא ג \" דס המסך , ק \" דא ג \" דס דגוף הספירות מבחינת דהיינו , עצמו של העביות מרשימות כלול שהוא מלבד כי התערבותם מטעם והוא . מטבור שלמטה ק \" דא ן \" דזו העביות מרשימות עוד כלול הוא הנה ונתערבו ק \" דא מטבור למטה ירדו ג \" דס שהנקודות ( א \" ס אות ) ש \" כמ , ק \" דא מטבור למטה יחד . שם אשר ק \" דא ן \" הזו עם יחד 70) Now, what is the fundamental difference between the Partzuf (the world) Nikudim and the previous Partzufim? The fact is that, during the creation of the previous Partzufim, a Zivug de Haka’a was always made on one pair of Reshimot – de Hitlabshut and de Aviut. In this case, however, two pairs of Reshimot rose to Rosh de SAG. This is because it consists not merely of Reshimot of its own Aviut, i.e., reflects the properties of the Sefirot of Guf de SAG, but it also includes the Reshimot of Aviut de ZON of Partzuf AK below the Tabur. This happened because they were mixed under the Tabur of Partzuf AK; as said in § 61, the Nekudot de SAG descended under the Tabur de AK and merged there with ZON de AK. The first pair is the usual Bet/Aleph , i.e., the Reshimot that emerge one after the other, following the weakening of the screen of Partzuf SAG (Gimel/Bet) . A Zivug de Haka’a is made on these Reshimot , which leads to the creation of the Partzuf MA Elion . This Partzuf, as well as the following BON Elion, have nothing to do with us, i.e., the actual creation."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 283 These Partzufim exist only for the completion of the world AK . As is well known, each spiritual object is supposed to consist of five Behinot . Similarly, the world AK must have its own five parts. AK mus t ha v e its o wn f iv e par ts. AK The second pair is also Bet/Aleph , but these Reshimot are complete- ly different. First, they contain the information about TB that occurred in the Nekudot de SAG , and the ban on direct use of any desires of recep- tion, i.e., it is forbidden to receive Ohr Hochma directly, even with the intention for the Creator’s sake. It means that, now, only the vessels down to Gar de Bina (included) can be used. Secondly, these Reshimot contain information about the presence of Nekudot de SAG under Tabur . Zivug de Haka’a is made on these Reshimot , which leads to the creation of Katnut (the small state) of the world of Nikudim . The third pair is Dalet/Gimel , i.e., the enormous desires, which are close to the Essence of the Creation by their properties, that were taken on by the Nekudot de SAG from the NHYM de Galgalta . A Zivug de Haka’a is made on these Reshimot , which leads to the creation of Gadlut (the big state) of the world of Nikudim . In fact, a Katnut de Nikudim is the Partzuf , Partzuf , Partzuf while a Gadlut de Nikudim is already the world. Just the availability of these enormous desires, this additional Aviut, allows for the creation of the world, which consists of several Partzufim . Thus, the awakening of the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel leads to the emergence of the world. The study of Kabbalah is a cumulative process. The Creator knows exactly how much time you spend sitting at the lessons, listening to texts and struggling with sleep. He considers everything and then turns on the tap. Everyone has his own way. There are no bright or stupid people here. What is important are the efforts made to withstand the egoistic desires. However, there is no need to do anything artificially. One must persistently advance without fear of being thrown back. To avoid it, one"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 284 must do something for the group, translate articles, and spread Kabbalah wherever possible. Man does not know until the last moment when he is going to reach the next level. It is now advisable to learn to think in spiritual categories. הרשימות מבחינת אשר . וגדלות קטנות ענין הנקודים בפרצוף כאן נתחדש זה ומכח ( עא שלמטה ק \" דא ן \" דזו הרשימות ומבחינות . נקודים דקטנות ס \" ע עליהם יצאו , שבמסך דעביות . נקודים דגדלות ס \" הע עליהם יצאו , המסך של הרשימות עם ונתערבו שנתחברו , מטבור 71) Owing to the merging of the Sefirot under the Tabur of the Partzuf AK, new states of Gadlut and Katnut (big and small states) emerged in the Partzuf Nikudim. The ten Sefirot de Katnut of Ni- kudim emerged on the Reshimot de Aviut in the Masach of Partzuf SAG. The ten Sefirot de Gadlut of Nikudim emerged on the Reshi- mot ZON de AK under the Tabur that were mixed with the Reshi- mot of the Masach. , נקודים הפרצוף לעיקר נחשבים , המסך על שיצאו נקודים דקטנות ס \" הע אשר , תדע גם ( עב פרצופים ' ג שיצאו ד \" ע , דעליון דגוף המסך מעצם דהיינו , המדרגה סדר על שיצאו משום , הנקודים פרצוף על בלבד לתוספת רק נבחנות נקודים דגדלות ס \" הע אבל . ק \" דא הקודמים , המדרגה סדר על באו שלא , מטבור שלמטה ק \" דא ן \" דזו הרשימות על מזווג רק שיצאו משום ק \" דא מטבור למטה ג \" דס נקודות דפרצוף ירידתו מסבת המסך על ונתוספו שנתחברו אלא .( ע אות ) 72) Know that the ten Sefirot of Katnut of the world of Nikudim are considered the principal Partzuf, since it emerged similarly to the three previous Partzufim of the world AK. It was born because of a Zivug de Aka’a on the Reshimot Bet/Aleph in the Masach de Guf of the upper Partzuf. The ten Sefirot de Gadlut are only an addition to the Partzuf Nikudim, because they appeared, not in the order of the emergence of levels, but from a Zivug on the Reshimot of ZON de Galgalta, which were added to the screen as a result of the descent of Nekudot de SAG under the Tabur. At first, man wants to “understand” Kabbalah, but comprehen- sion comes through applying efforts, not by absorbing information. The"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 285 study merely allows us “to contact” the spiritual world. The information provides just the general outline; the way things are designed. But how can we touch it, find out where it is, in what virtual space we can get hold of it, feel it, what the connection is between certain phenomena? It is similar to a musician who feels each note. Any specialist in his field instantly understands the meaning, internally feels it in his mind, his senses, then passes it through himself and builds an inner picture. Man always perceives with his senses. For many years, I used to work with fighter planes. New digital computing equipment was intro- duced at that time. A pilot, however, saw only arrows on his control pan- els. However, while a man cannot concentrate on digits during the flight, he can instantly evaluate the situation by casting a glance at the arrows, This is because images play the most important role in our perception. What we learn here technically only provides a formal basis, but the principal purpose is to create inner images in ourselves, upon which all technical information can be gradually dressed. This depends on the efforts we put into it. Spiritual sensation is born in man as an addition to his five senses. It is in no way connected to the mind or any other senses. Hence, it is irrelevant in what language man reads Kabbalistic books. It is important to attract the Surrounding Light. There are methods of promoting a more powerful influence. Man’s mind plays no role in it. Only persistence and desire will allow us to enter the Creator’s domain. My Rabbi did not permit me to move to the city of Bnei Brak for a long time, so I had to come from Rechovot twice a day. At 10 p.m., I used to return home, only to be back to the lesson by 2 a.m. I was tired, slept at the lessons, but the Rabbi used to say that I would learn everything I needed to. The efforts have played their part. If man thinks there is no sense in attending a class, because he overslept and would not comprehend anything, it demonstrates his failure to under-"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 286 stand that spiritual efforts are not measured by time or physical strength, but by an inner resistance to egoism, even if it is instantaneous... There was a man in our group who finished working late, so he came in a taxi to catch the final ten minutes of the evening class. These ten minutes gave him more than someone else who spent two hours studying. I do not have a grudge against those who spend their time sitting in a bar or in front of the TV set. They have not been given the desire for Kabbalah. This life will pass, and then a couple more lives, until their souls finally mature. We went through the same process in the previous incarnations; I can clearly see it on the people sitting here... , ק \" דא ג \" הס התפשטות אחר כי , ידעת וכבר . נקודים דקטנות ס \" הע נבאר תחילה והנה ( עג אשר . המדרגה דרך על אותו וזיכך , שלו המסך על דהיינו , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש בו נעשה ק \" דא מטבור למטה שירדו והן .\" ג \" דס נקודות \" נקראות , הזדככותו בדרך היוצאות הקומות דגוף העביות מכל להזדכך שנגמר אחר והנה .( ב \" ס אות ) שם אשר ד \" הבחי עם ונתערבו , מחדש זווג שם וקבל , ג \" הס לראש שעלה נבחן , דראש עביות בחינת רק בו נשאר ולא , שבמסך .( ה \" ל אות ) שבמסך ברשימות שנשארו העביות שיעור על 73) First, let us examine the process of the birth of the Partzuf Kat- nut de Nikudim. As we know, after the spreading of Partzuf SAG, the Bitush Ohr Pnimi and Makif takes place in its Masach. It weak- ens the Masach and forces it to return to the Peh de Rosh. With that, the intermediate Partzufim, called Nekudot de SAG, emerge and descend under the Tabur of the Partzuf AK. There they are mixed with Behina Dalet. After the Masach lost all of its Aviut and only the Masach de Rosh is left in the Partzuf, the Masach de Guf suppos- edly rises to the Peh de Rosh and leads to a new Zivug on the Aviut de Reshimot that remained in the Masach. נאבדה , במסך שהיתה ב \" דבחי העביות שהיא , דעביות אחרונה שבחינה , נבחן כאן וגם ( עד . בלבד א \" בחי אם כי נשאר לא ומהעביות . ממנה נשאר דהתלבשות רשימו ורק , לגמרי דעביות א \" בחי מהתכללות . א : זווגים מיני ' ב ג \" הס בראש שם המסך קבל ( ג \" מ אות ) ולפיכך קומת עליהן יצאה , דזכר בהרשימו דנקבה הרשימו התכללות \" הנקרא , דהתלבשות ב \" בחי תוך .\" דנקודים הכתר ספירת \" נקרא זו וקומה . דבינה ק \" ו בערך שהוא , בקירוב בינה"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 287 א \" בבחי דהתלבשות ב \" דבחי הרשימו התכללות דהיינו , דנקבה בהרשימו הזכר מהתכללות . ב .\" א \" אב דנקודים ואמא אבא \" הנקרא , ראש בלי ק \" ו בחינת שהוא , א \" ז קומת יצאה , דעביות מכונה ראש כל כי . נקודים דראש ס \" ע בחינת כלומר ,\" דנקודים ר \" ג \" נקראות הללו קומות ' וב מתפשט אינו , הזכר קומת שהוא , דנקודים הכתר כי , ביניהם חילוק ויש . ב \" כח או ר \" ג בשם , לגוף מתפשטת לבדה היא , הנקבה קומת שהם , דנקודים א \" ואו , מאיר הוא בראש ורק לגוף .\" דנקודים י \" נה ת \" חג \" או \" דנקודים תחתונות ס \" ז \" הנקרא 74) As always, the last level (in this case the Aviut of the Behina Bet) completely disappeared after the return of the Masach to the Rosh. Only the Reshimo de Hitlabshut and the Behina Aleph de Aviut remained. As in all the previous Partzufim, two Zivugim occur in the Rosh de SAG after the Reshimot that were left from the intermediate Partzuf Nekudot de SAG rose there. One of them happens because of the inclusion of the Reshimo de Aviut (Nekeva) in the Reshimo de Hit- labshut (Zachar). In this case, the matter concerns the emergence of the world of Niku- dim; hence, this is the Reshimo Aleph de Aviut and Bet de Hitlab- shut. Because of this Zivug, the Sefira of the level called “Bina be Kiruv” or “VAK de Bina” emerges, i.e., the interim state between Bina and ZA. This Sefira is called Keter of the world of Nikudim. A second Zivug happened because of the inclusion of the Reshimo de Hitlabshut (Zachar) in the Reshimo de Aviut (Nekeva), from which the Sefira of the level of ZA or “VAK bli Rosh” emerged. This Sefira is called Abba ve Ima of the world of Nikudim, and they are in a back-to-back position (Achor be Achor). These two levels are called two heads of the world of Nikudim. How- ever, there is a difference between them. It consists in the fact that Keter de Nikudim, i.e., the level of Zachar, does not spread into the Guf, but shines only in the Rosh, whereas Abba ve Ima de Nikudim, i.e., the level of Nekeva, spreads into the Guf and is called HaGaT NHYM de Nikudim."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 288 The Nikudim is the first world that is built according to TB ; hence, there are certain elements in it that are related to our world. The distance between the Creator and us can be divided as follows: the Rosh de Galgalta is, roughly speaking, the Dalet Behinot de Ohr Yashar (four phases of emergence and development of the Direct Light). Then, Malchut of the World of Infinity is positioned from the Peh de Galgalta downwards. It decides to accept some part of the light (Ta’amim) into the Toch after the TA. Further pressure of the Ohr Makif on the Ohr Makif on the Ohr Makif Masach leads to its weak- ening and to the gradual emergence of the Partzufim de Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA and BON . Then the Nekudot de SAG descend under the Tabur and form the 10 Sefirot , which consist of GE (the vessels of bestowal) and AHP (the vessels of reception). An enormous “desire to receive” the light AHP (the v essels of r ecep tion). An enormous “desir e t o r eceiv e ” the light AHP for themselves manifests in the vessels of reception. Thus, observing the conditions of TA , Malchut of the World of Infinity rises to Bina and prevents the reception of the light by those vessels. This is how Tzimtzum Bet took place. The screen of Nekudot de SAG commenced rising with the Reshimot Bet de Hitlabshut/Aleph de Aviut, the Reshimot of TB and of the NHYM de Galgalta (Dalet/Gimel). A Zivug A Zivug A is then made on the first pair or Zivug is then made on the f ir s t pair or Zivug Reshimot (usual Bet/Aleph ), which leads to the formation of the Partzufim MA Elion and BON Elion . One more Zivug is made on the Zivug is made on the Zivug Reshimot Bet/Aleph, plus the information of TB , and the light spreads only in GE . The Partzuf that Partzuf that Partzuf emerged on this pair of Reshimot is called Katnut of the world of Nikudim (see above). When people who study “The Preamble to the Science of Kab- balah” reach this point, they feel a sudden change, and have to start learning from the beginning. This turning point is not random, since beginning from TB and on, we begin to study the origins of our soul. TA and its consequences are not directly connected with our soul. Starting from the first Partzuf based on Partzuf based on Partzuf TB – the world of Nikudim and further, we begin to see the development of our soul, properties and aspirations that"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 289 originate from the fragments of the common soul of Adam HaRishon . There is no doubt that the laws of TA , although having no direct influ- ence on us, generally affect the entire Universe. After their descent under the Tabur , the Nekudot de SAG acquired additional desires (Dalet/Gimel) , for which they did not have a proper screen, i.e., the force of resistance. A surplus of the egoistic desires was formed, and because of this Malchut rose to Bina up to the upper third of Tifferet . Now the light cannot spread below the Parsa . For the light to spread from the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Parsa , SAG has to make a prior calculation in the Rosh . To that end, it raises the screen from the Peh to the Nikvey Eynaim. This is the boundary between Gar de Bina and Zat de Bina de Rosh , i.e., between the vessels of bestowal and reception. This happens in the the Rosh de SAG under the Tabur de AK , taking into account that the light would spread only down to the Parsa in the Guf de Nikudim under the Tabur de AK. Here the Partzuf Katnut de Nikudim emerges. It has two heads (Keter and Abba ve Ima) and Guf (ZON) . Both heads are in a back-to-back position (“Achor be Achor”) . There is a notion “combination of the Partzufim ” in the spiritual world. As the light gradu- ally spreads from one Sefira to another in ten Sefirot of each Partzuf , the Partzuf , the Partzuf upper part of the Sefira is the receiving one, the middle part is the Sefira proper, and the lower part gives the light to the next Sefira . Abba ve Ima de Nikudim are in a back-to-back position. It means that none has the Ohr Hochma . Another explanation suggests that they received the correction called “Achor be Achor” or “Ki Hafetz Hesed” , i.e., they have only the Ohr Hassadim. Normally the word “Achoraim” (back part) means the part used ei- ther for reception or for bestowal. “Panim” (face) has the opposite mean- ing; it is the property being used. The correction, “Achor be Achor”, is also called “the correction of Achoraim de Ima ”, which is Bina de Ohr Yashar . It is unwilling to receive the Ohr Hochma , just the Ohr Hassadim . Abba ve Ima is ZA , the Behinat VAK (the lack of Behinat VAK (the lac k of Behinat VAK Ohr Hochma ), but thanks to the received correction, they only want the Hassadim . Hence, it"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 290 is considered as the Rosh and Gar . They received this correction through Zachar , which has the Bet de Hitlabshut . Abba ve Ima - Behina Aleph de Aviut - was included in the Bet de Hitlabshut . Consequently, when a Zivug was made on their Behinot , they were also involved in a Zivug with their Zivug with their Zivug property “Kli Hafetz Hesed” . The same happens in the world of the Nikudim . Two objects may be in four states: Achor be Achor, Achor be Panim, Panim be Achor and Panim be Panim . When Abba ve Ima are in the state of Achor be Achor , Abba is unable to give Ima anything, while Ima does not want to receive anything from Aba . Only in the state of the Panim be Panim can Abba transfer the light to Ima . There are two kinds of Zivugim : the spiritual, when no Partz- uf is born, and “corporeal”, which leads to the birth of a new uf is born, and “cor por eal”, whic h leads t o the bir th of a ne w uf Partzuf . Partzuf .

Recall that Galgalta (Keter) has the Reshimo Dalet/Dalet (4/4), AB (Hochma) has the Reshimo Dalet/Gimel (4/3), and SAG (Bina) has the Reshimo Gimel/Bet (3/2). The next Partzuf is the world of Partzuf is the w orld of Partzuf Nikudim . It is Partzuf ZA or MA (shortened due to TB ). Therefore, Abba ve Ima and ZON de Nikudim constitute just this common ZA of the world AK . Note that the world of Nikudim in Katnut is no more than the fourth Partzuf (ZA) of the world AK . Keter of the world of the Nikudim represents VAK de Bina , the interim level between the Partzuf Bina (SAG) and the Partzuf ZA (the world of Nikudim ). Previously we paid no attention to the fact that the Partzuf has Partzuf has Partzuf two heads, although this was present in each Partzuf . Since there are Partzuf . Since ther e ar e Partzuf"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 291 two kinds of Reshimot – Hitlabshut and Aviut , there are also two types of Zivugim , and consequently two heads. However, they did not play a major role before, so we never mentioned them. Here, in the state of Katnut de Nikudim, they play a very special part and are very important. Let us learn to “adapt” ourselves to the laws of the spiritual worlds. There is a soul, man. Previously he had the screen on all his desires, with the help of which he could receive a certain amount of the light for the Creator’s sake. Now he cannot knowingly use all his desires for the Creator, since there are those among them that wish to receive for their own sake. Hence, he chooses not to use them, but puts them aside and works only with the altruistic desires: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, and a part of Tifferet . Now, there appears a basis for the emergence of the observed de- sires-commandments, which refer to Sefirot above the Parsa , and the for- bidden desires, which refer to Sefirot below the Parsa . When, at the Final Correction, the Partzuf acquires the screen for the forbidden desires and Partzuf acq uir es the scr een f or the f orbidden desir es and Partzuf they turn into the ones to be observed, he will be able to completely fill himself with the light. The light is pleasure. If I enjoy the reception, it is called egoism. If I enjoy the act of giving, it is still egoism, but of a totally “different kind”. There is no Ohr Hochma or Hassadim under the Parsa after TB , only ab- solute darkness. When the worlds Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya are formed under the Parsa , some light appears in them, the so-called Ohr Tolada, i.e., a small luminescence destined for the spiritual birth and correction, but not for the reception of pleasure. In our rise to the Parsa, we climb 6000 steps or levels to reach and cross this barrier that separates us from the spiritual worlds. Then the Mashiah (the Upper Light) comes, resurrects the dead, egoistic desires, and corrects them. Then they can be used for the reception of the light- pleasure. This process is called “the resurrection of the dead”. We should stress that there is a fundamental difference between the creation of the worlds (the process we are studying) and creation"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 292 of souls. Strictly speaking, the worlds are not the creation; they are the levels of the Creator’s concealment, still objects, robots. Only man, who climbs these steps, turning them into the levels of the Creator’s revelation, animates them. We have spoken about this. Nevertheless, it is so important that it merits repeated mentioning. Now, as we study the structure of the worlds, we learn about the creation of the spiritual environment for the future souls. The worlds promoted the creation of the soul of Adam HaRishon. Then this soul broke into many fragments. Each of them represents a human soul, which, upon its correction, will be able to receive the light, tearing off the spheres and filters during its ascent. The Parsa is called “the point of the world to come”. The Sium of Galgalta is “the point of this world”. The difference between the two points is the place of the worlds BYA . The world of Atzilut is called Gan Eden (Paradise). In our world, we have the task of acquiring the vessels of bestowal (GE) . This is achieved by crossing the barrier ( the Machsom) and advanc- ing to the Parsa . Only in the world of Atzilut do we begin to correct the vessels of reception (AHP) . This means that, during 6000 years or levels, we only acquire the altruistic desires. Upon entering the seventh millennium, the world of Atzilut , we will be able to start correcting the egoistic desires. This is called the res- urrection of the dead egoistic desires, which were forbidden to be used. This process takes 4000 more years. The tenth millennium already refers to the secrets of the Torah, of which we may not speak. There is no time, as we understand it, in spirituality. The so-called millennium can be passed in one day, provided the necessary corrections are made. The spiritual level is called “a year”, since while passing a certain level, the soul’s desires go through a full cycle of changes. We study the most necessary science in our life, through which all others are attained. Imagine an empty space in which your “I” emerges."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 293 This “I” is endowed with senses, with the ability to feel. Whatever you feel inside your senses is called your world. Who provides you with these sensations? The Creator does. He emerges from nowhere, existing out- side, but you can feel Him only inside of you. People differ by their sets of desires to receive pleasure. One strives after power, while another is drawn to money; one longs for animal plea- sures, yet another is attracted to science. Similar phenomena exist in the spiritual world. It is impossible “to enter” the spiritual essence of another human being. Therefore, we should never compare our sensations with those of others, since everyone runs them through his own set of desires. We cannot compare two different people's sensations of the same food, even though in both cases it will be, say, sweet. Only the Creator’s light is common for all. Whatever is necessary for man’s existence is not considered ego- ism, although people’s needs are quite diverse. Had I been satisfied with receiving nothing for my existence, I would have been free from all and totally independent. However, I still have to devote some time to satisfy- ing the needs of my body. The Creator made me this way, and, although I would be happy not to do it, this does not depend on me. Egoism means following one’s own desire. Here man must deter- mine what is necessary for the existence of his body, and what is su- perfluous and serves the satisfaction of his egoistic desires. However, the goal is to feel the Creator. Gradually increasing the sensation of the Creator will give us strength, confidence and the opportunity to move forward, correctly evaluating the current situation. Kabbalah does not turn man into a fanatic nor oblige him to give something up. On the contrary, it wishes to lead him to absolute perfec- tion and delight. Only the thoughts that cross your mind during the reading of a genuine text, combined with the explanations of a true"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 294 Teacher, can lead to a good result. If you are away from the book and your thoughts divert you from Kabbalah, consider yourself outside of it. Kabbalah leads us to a state in which we can already feel the point in the heart. In this state we can evaluate ourselves, not from the angle of the egoistic desires, but according to the apprehension of the Universe and our own place in it, i.e., from the altruistic standpoint. Then a con- tradiction, between egoism and altruism arises, which forces man to cry out to the Creator for help, for deliverance from his egoism. There are two kinds of Rosh in each Partzuf: the Rosh de Hitlabshut and the Rosh de Aviut . The Rosh de Hitlabshut contains information about the light that was present in the previous Partzuf . The Partzuf . The Partzuf Rosh de Aviut says which Masach is available at this moment. These two kinds of informa- tion are all there is in the entire Universe: the power of the light and the strength of the vessel. They provide us with two notions: the power of delight in the Creator’s light and the strength of the screen in the Kli . Then, after making such a calculation in the Rosh , the vessel receives some part of the light in the Guf for the Creator’s sake . As was stated, the Rosh de Hitlabshut in the world of Nikudim is called Keter , and the Rosh de Aviut - Abba ve Ima . Yet there is the third head in the world of Nikudim – head in the world of Nik udim – head in the world of the YESHSUT . However, we usually dis- regard it, since it refers to TA , is under the Tabur and is considered a part Tabur and is consider ed a par t Tabur of the Partzuf SAG. Keter and SAG. Keter and SAG. Keter Abba ve Ima already refer to TB . Each Reshimo should give birth to a thought that can emerge in action. The thought that was born because of the previous pleasure, the Reshimo de Hitlabshut, the Rosh de Keter , cannot come to realization for the lack of proper screen. It can emerge only by a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimo de Aviut, the body of the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf The world of Nikudim consists of the Rosh de Keter, the Rosh de Abba ve Ima and the Guf – ZON , which itself includes seven Sefirot . The AHP de ZON is under the AHP de ZON is under the AHP de ZON Parsa and joins the Partzuf only in the state of Partzuf only in the s t at e of Partzuf Gadlut . In this way, the AHP passes its egoistic desires on to the altruistic AHP passes its egois tic desir es on t o the altruis tic AHP"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 295 vessels, i.e., GE , which in accordance with TA , leads to the loss of the screen, the breaking of the vessels and the disappearance of the light. Only the empty egoistic desires remain. Now we are studying the state of Katnut of the world of Nikudim that emerged as a result of a Zivug made on Zivug made on Zivug Reshimot Bet/Aleph . We come across some entirely new notions that need to be very thoroughly exam- ined, since our Kli , our soul, is based on them. We are created because of the laws of TB . By overcoming the 6000 years or levels, we cover the dis- tance from our world to the Parsa , and then enter the world of Atzilut . The descending structure of the Universe described by Kabbalists, and man’s attainment of the spiritual worlds, pass through the same lev- els. In fact, the Creator created all the spiritual worlds so that they would serve as steps-levels in man’s attainment. The Kabbalists left us a detailed description of the descent; the ascent is attained by each man individu- ally and is impossible to describe. We study the laws of the spiritual Uni- verse and must know them if we wish to exist in the spiritual world. The laws of TB apply to this world, but we see them in their ma- terial form: physical, chemical, biological and social. All these laws are expressed in their outward appearance, but if we look closely enough, we will see that they are also based on the spreading of the light, the forma- tion of the screen etc. We study the basic laws of the Universe, reaching into the very depths of it. נתבקעו יציאתן שבעת , דנקודים המדרגות אלו נבחנות , לבינה המלכות עלית שמכח , ותדע ( עו בראש אין , עינים בנקבי נעשה שהזווג מאחר כי .\" אחורים \" ו \" פנים \" הנקראים , חצאים ' לב העליון וחצי חכמה כתר דהיינו , עינים ונקבי ועינים גלגלתא שהם , וחצי ספירות ' ב אלא , ונוקבא א \" וז התחתון בינה חצי שהם , פ \" דאח והכלים .\" דפנים כלים \" מכונים והם . דבינה הכלים אלו כן ועל , מהראש שלמטה המדרגה של לבחינתה ונעשים דראש ס \" מהע יצאו . ומדרגה מדרגה כל נבקעה ז \" ועד . דאחורים לכלים נבחנים , מהראש לחוץ שיצאו , דראש 76) Know that all the levels of the Nikudim are determined by the rising of Malchut to Bina. Moreover, they divide into two parts: “Panim ve Achoraim” (front and back of the Partzuf). After making"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 296 a Zivug in the Nikvey Eynaim, there are only two and a half Sefirot in the Rosh: GE and Nikvey Eynaim, i.e., Keter, Hochma, and the upper third of Bina, which are actually the Kelim de Panim. AHP, which consists of the lower two thirds of Bina, ZA and Nukva (Mal- chut) got outside the ten Sefirot de Rosh and is now called the Kelim de Achoraim, which are not taken into account during a Zivug. Each subsequent level is divided similarly. So, a Zivug de Haka’a cannot be made on AHP . No calculations and no reception of the light are possible. These Sefirot may not be used, since they are under the screen. Only the vessels of bestowal above the screen are taken into account. Accordingly, only the two and a half up- per Sefirot are filled with the light in the Guf of Partzuf – Keter, Hochma, and the Gar de Bina . Such a state, when the receiving vessels are not used, is called Katnut . Only the vessels of bestowal are worked with. It is similar to the situation where a host puts 10 different dishes be- fore his guest. The guest, however, tells him that he can only enjoy watch- ing this culinary abundance without touching anything. By not receiving, the guest likens himself to the giver. According to the force, which resists his egoism, he can receive only two salads for the sake of the host. The Partzuf SAG , which refuses to receive anything, has the Rosh, the Toch, and the Sof . By not receiving, it enjoys tremendously its con- Sof . By no t r eceiving, it enjo y s tr emendously its con- Sof nection with the Creator, His revelation. Since the SAG is similar to the Creator by its properties, the Ohr Hassadim spreads in it. A question arises: should a Zivug de Haka’a be made on the Ohr Hassadim ? Previously we only dealt with a Zivug de Haka’a on the Ohr Hochma . It turns out that a Zivug must also be made on the Zivug mus t also be made on the Zivug Ohr Hassadim . As we have already said, the Creator’s light is indivisible, and only the vessel distinguishes the various kinds of pleasure in it, according to its properties. Since there is a screen and a Zivug de Haka’a , there are also the Rosh, the Toch, and the Sof of the Sof of the Sof Kelim , in which the Ohr Hassadim spreads. They are called GE – Keter, Hochma and Gar de Bina (the vessels of bestowal), whereas the light does not enter AHP ."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 297 The Creator created the ten Sefirot . They are always present. Ev- erything depends only on the strength of our screen and the ability to work with it. Now the screen is weak and can work only with the Kelim de Panim (the vessels of bestowal). There are the Kelim de Panim in the Rosh , the Toch and the Sof . However, we cannot work with the Sof . Ho w ev er , w e canno t w or k with the Sof Kelim de Achoraim (the vessels of reception) that are also present there. Hence, the screen rises from the Peh to Nikvey Eynaim . The entire Partzuf takes a different form: the Partzuf t ak es a dif f er ent f orm: the Partzuf Peh is in Nikvey Ey- naim , the Tabur is where the Tabur is wher e the Tabur Peh was, and the Sof is where the Sof is wher e the Sof Chazeh was. Thus, after TB , the Partzufim use only the uppermost, giving, parts of their desires. According to the law of the inverse relation between the vessels and the lights, the light that fills them is correspondingly smaller than that which fills the Partzufim in TA (the lower, coarser Kelim the Partzuf uses, the higher light fills it). Due to the rise of the screen, which Partzuf uses, the higher light f ills it). Due t o the rise of the scr een , whic h Partzuf leads to using only the giving vessels, the Partzuf can entirely descend Partzuf can entir ely descend Partzuf under the Tabur of Tabur of Tabur Galgalta and work with the coarse desires, using only the giving part of each of them. The Partzufim of the world of AK are AK ar e AK unable to use these coarse desires, because they make a calculation on both the giving and the receiving parts. Partzufim of the world of AK can AK can AK descend under the Tabur only for passing the light to the lower Tabur only f or passing the light t o the lo w er Tabur Partzufim that function in TB , for at that stage, they do not make any calculation with regard to themselves, but with regard to those they bestow upon. The notions “Panim” and “Achoraim” are self-explanatory: Panim is a more significant stage, Achoraim – less significant. Panim is used for both giving and receiving; Achoraim is a stage that is used for neither giving nor reception. שהם , זכר דקומת פ \" האח כי . ואחורים פנים בה שאין , מדרגה לך שאין , ז \" לפי ונמצא ( עז . הנקבה קומת שהם , דנקודים א \" או למדרגת וירדו הכתר ממדרגת יצאו , דנקודים הכתר למדרגות דהיינו , שלהם הגוף למדרגת ונפלו ירדו , דנקודים א \" או שהם , הנקבה דקומת פ \" ואח בפנימיותם כי , ואחורים פנים בחינות ' מב כלולים א \" שאו , ונמצא . דנקודים י \" נה ת \" חג ס \" ז א \" דאו דפנים הכלים מלביש ועליהם , דכתר פ \" האח דהיינו , הכתר מדרגת של אחורים נמצאים מפנים כלולים דנקודים ת \" הז וכן . עצמם שלהם עינים ונקבי ועינים גלגלתא דהיינו , עצמם"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 298 והכלים . ת \" הז בפנימיות נמצאים , שלהם פ \" אח שהם , א \" דאו דאחורים הכלים כי . ומאחורים . מבחוץ עליהם מלבישים נמצאים ת \" דז דפנים 77) There is no level in the world of the Nikudim that would not divide into Panim and Achoraim. Therefore, the AHP de Keter, i.e., the Zachar de Nikudim, descended to the level of the Panim de Rosh, Abba ve Ima; in other words, to the level of Nekeva. AHP, i.e., Achoraim de Nekeva of Abba ve Ima, descended to the Guf, i.e., to HaGaT NHYM de Nikudim. Thus, both Keter and Abba ve Ima consist of two parts: Panim and Achoraim. In other words, Panim de Abba ve Ima dress onto the Achoraim de Keter that descended from above. Achoraim de Abba ve Ima, which descended to the Guf, constitutes the inner part on which Panim de Guf dress. For example, there were five thoughts in the Rosh and correspond- ingly five desires in the Guf to receive pleasure from the light that is in Guf t o r eceiv e pleasur e fr om the light that is in Guf the Rosh . Now, there are only two and a half thoughts in the Rosh and two and a half desires to receive pleasure. The rest of the desires are in- side the lower level and are not used. המדרגות אלו בכל להיות אפשר שאי , כ \" ג גרם חצאים ' לב המדרגות דהתחלקות זה וענין ( עח הכלים ' ג מדרגה בכל שחסר מתוך כי . ר \" ג בחסר ק \" ו דהיינו , רוח נפש מבחינת יותר דנקודים היטב נתבארו והנה .( ד \" כ אות ) יחידה חיה נשמה שהם , דאורות ר \" ג שם חסר הרי , ן \" וזו בינה כתר זולת מדרגה בכל ואין . ת \" ז , א \" או , כתר : הנקראות מדרגות ' ג שהן , נקודים דקטנות ס \" הע . שמתחתיה למדרגה נפלה מדרגה דכל ן \" וזו הבינה כי , דאורות רוח ונפש דכלים חכמה 78) The division of each level into two parts led to the presence of only the lights of Nefesh and Ruach in each upper part of the level, i.e., VAK, and the vessels Keter, Hochma and a part of Bina. There- fore, there are three levels in Katnut de Nikudim: Keter, Abba ve Ima and Zat, i.e., the vessels Keter, Hochma and a part of Bina, and the lights Nefesh and Ruach, since Zat de Bina and ZON descended from their level to the lower one."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 299 R A I S I N G O F M A N A N D G A D L U T O F T H E W O R L D O F N I K U D I M דנקודים הגדלות ויציאת ן \" מ עלית שלמטה ק \" דא ן \" הזו של דרשימות ן \" המ על שיצאו , הנקודים דגדלות ס \" הע נבאר ועתה ( עט מעלית אם כי דברנו לא עתה עד כי . ן \" מ עלית ענין מקודם לידע ויש .( א \" ע אות ) מטבורו הזווג שם נעשה , בו הנכללות הרשימות שעל . שנזדכך אחר , דעליון דראש לפה דגוף המסך , נוקבין מיין עלית ענין נתחדש עתה אמנם . התחתון לצורך ס \" ע קומת המוציאות , דהכאה , ק \" דא דגופא ן \" דזו הרשימות שהם , ג \" הס לראש ק \" דא מטבור מלמטה שעלו האורות אלו כי .\" ן \" מ עלית \" בשם מכונים 79) Now we will learn about the ten Sefirot de Gadlut de Nikudim that emerged on MAN from the Reshimot of ZON de AK below the Tabur. Until now, we have not spoken about the raising of MAN. We discussed the rise of the Masach de Guf from the Tabur to the Peh de Rosh of the upper Partzuf, and a Zivug de Haka’a in the Rosh that was made on the Reshimot included in Masach, which led to the formation of the ten Sefirot of the lower Partzuf. Now let us talk about the light that rose from under the Tabur de AK to the Rosh de SAG, i.e., about the Reshimot of the ZON de Guf of the world of AK that are called “Mey Nukvin” (rising of female waters) or “Aliyat MAN”. “Aliyat MAN” is the rise of the desire, a request from the lower spir- itual object to the upper one about making a Zivug de Haka’a . Malchut asks Bina (the soul turns to the Creator) to fill its emptiness, to correct its property of reception, to make Malchut similar to Him, the Creator, the “desire to give”. It is called female waters because this is a request for the light of Hassadim , the altruistic desire. Malchut had the 10 Sefirot completely filled with the light in the World of Infinity. Wishing to be like the Creator, it expelled the 10 Se- firot , i.e., it did not want to feel them. Nevertheless, they did not cease to exist because of it. Malchut chooses either to feel pleasure from them or not, but its nature remains unchanged."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 300 After TA the Rosh, Toch and Sof are created in Sof ar e cr eat ed in Sof Malchut ; it begins to calculate how much light it can receive for the Creator’s sake. The Partzuf formed consists of three parts; each part contains ten Partzuf f ormed consis ts of thr ee par ts; eac h par t cont ains t en Partzuf Sefirot. The Sof emerged because Sof emer ged because Sof Malchut began calculating its possibilities and un- derstood that not all of them coincide with its desires, that it can fill with the light only 20% of its desires to receive for the Creator. 80% of the desires cannot be filled, so Malchut restricts them - makes the Sof and Sof and Sof leaves it empty. It will continue to be so until the Gmar Tikkun , when all 100% of the desires for the Creator’s sake will be filled with His light. Then there will not be any need for the Rosh or any calculations. Malchut will be able to receive the Creator’s entire light without any preliminary testing of its own powers. There will not be any uncorrected desires left. The angel of death will turn into the angel of holiness. Only the Toch will remain. However, in the process of correction, calculations are essential. Restrictions may be quantitative (the Galgalta, AB, and SAG ) when the light is received (although only a certain amount, in accordance with TA laws) in each of the ten Sefirot , and qualitative when not all ten Sefirot are filled with the light, but only some of them, depending on their properties. Such qualitative division took place after TB , the state wherein only the small desires (of bestowal) are filled. On the other hand, Katnut is the state in which the big desires are not worked with. The lights that fill only the small desires are called Nefesh and Ruach . In this state, the creation feels only two and a half Sefirot out of its ten and does not work with the rest. If the creation gains additional powers and can activate the remaining Sefirot for receiving for the Creator’s sake, it enters the state of Gadlut . Now we are examining, according to the laws of TB, the transition from Katnut to Gadlut . In the course of our advancement from one level to another, the two states will alternately supersede one another. As soon as we enter the spiritual reality, climb its first level, we will gradually pass"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 301 from Katnut to Gadlut . Then the AHP of the upper level will instantly AHP of the upper lev el will ins t antly AHP lower us into the state of Katnut , but already of its own higher level on which we will have to achieve again Gadlut in order to descend into Kat- nut of the new level, and so on. All the 6000 descending levels are built so that the AHP of the AHP o f t h e AHP upper level is inside the GE of the lower one, and is dressed onto it. Hence, all the levels string one onto the other forming one ladder (Sulam) from the lowest point of the creation to its perfection – the Creator. Thanks to this close connection between the AHP and AHP a n d AHP GE , each soul can ascend by climbing one level after another until the Final Correction. Such advancement can be roughly compared to the peri- stalsis of intestines while pushing the digested food forward by way of contracting muscles. Any upper level is considered inner as regards the lower one, since it is closer to the Creator; it has a more powerful screen and bigger de- sires under the screen. Therefore, the levels become wider as they de- scend, which resembles a pyramid. אשר , שם ונתבאר .( ה אות ) י \" דאו ס \" הע של ובינה א \" מהז הוא ן \" מ עלית של שמקורו ודע ( פ חזרה , ג \" בחי הנקרא , ת \" הת ספירות את שהאצילה בעת , דחסדים אור בחינת שהיא , הבינה א \" הז ויצא . א \" ז שהוא ת \" הת בשביל חכמה הארת ממנו והמשיכה , החכמה עם להתחבר . חכמה בהארת ומיעוטו הבינה של חסדים אור מבחינת בעיקרו מתחברת , הבינה אל עולות א \" דז שהרשימות אימת שכל : והבינה א \" הז בין קשר נעשה ומכאן אל א \" הז של הזו והעליה . א \" הז בשביל , חכמה הארת ממנו וממשיכה , החכמה עם הבינה , להבינה א \" הז עלית בלי כי .\" ן \" מ עלית \" בשם תמיד מכונה , החכמה עם אותה המחברת , הבינה צריכה ואינה דחסדים אור רק בעצמותה בהיותה , החכמה אל לנוקבא נחשבת הבינה אין לקבל רוצה שאינה , שפירושו , החכמה עם באחור אחור תמיד שהיא ונבחנת . החכמה לאור . מהחכמה , חכמה הארת ממנו לקבל כדי , לחכמה נוקבא להעשות חוזרת , אליה א \" הז עלית בעת ורק .\" נוקבין מיין \" בשם עליתו מכונה לפיכך . לנוקבא אותה עושה א \" הז שעלית הרי . א \" הז בשביל נוקבא כבחינת ממנו שמקבלת שפירושו , החכמה עם בפנים פנים מחזירה א \" דז עליתו כי . ן \" המ עלית סוד היטב נתבאר והנה . מהדכר"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 302 80) You should know that ZA and Bina of the 10 Sefirot de Ohr Yashar (i.e., before Malchut de Ein Sof) are the source of raising MAN. This is what happened with them there: Bina, which is the Ohr Hassadim and the Behina Bet, gave birth to Tifferet (or ZA, the Behina Gimel) and reunited with Behinat Hochma to ask for the Ohr Hochma to pass on to ZA, which consists of the Ohr Hassadim and some luminescence of the Ohr Hochma. In this way, contact was established between ZA and Bina. Each time the Reshimot of ZA rise to Bina, the latter merges with Hochma and draws a small amount of the Ohr Hochma for ZA. Such a rise of ZA to Bina, and Bina’s connection with Hochma, is called the raising of MAN. Without this action, Bina itself has no need for the Ohr Hochma. Its essence is the Ohr Hassadim and it is always in the Achor be Achor (back-to-back) position with Hochma. Only the request of ZA prompts Bina to receive the Ohr Hochma for it and turns it to Nukva; hence, this rise is called “female waters” (i.e., the receiving Sefira) as regards Hochma and changes their posi- tion from back-to-back to face-to-face (Panim be Panim). All our corrections, prayers, during the 6000 years are made with the help of raising MAN . We (the souls) are parts of a general Malchut . Our request for correction arouses Malchut , which rises to Bina , forces it to receive the Ohr Hochma and pass it through ZA back to Malchut , which in turn transfers it to the souls. This chain rises like a call for help (raising MAN ) from the direction of Nukva and then descends as the Ohr Hochma (male waters). Here lie all our opportunities for spiritual enlight- enment, exaltedness, and revelation of the Creator. Gradually, we have to clear up these two principles. We are now coming closer to the material that relates directly to us, our souls. First, it will seem difficult, muddled, but it needs to be mastered; with time it will enter into our sensations."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 303 . הבינה פרצוף הוא ק \" דא ג \" הס ופרצוף . החכמה פרצוף הוא ק \" דא ב \" ע שפרצוף ידעת וכבר ( פא שלו העליונה שבחינה ב \" הע כי . שלהם הקומה של העליונה בחינה לפי נבחנים שהם , דהיינו . בינה לכולו נחשב , בינה היא שלו העליונה שבחינה , ג \" והס . חכמה לכולו נחשב , חכמה הוא ן \" למ שמה נעשו , ג \" הס לראש עלו , ק \" דא מטבורו שלמטה דגוף ן \" דזו שהרשימות בעת , ולפיכך ב \" הע והשפיע . חכמה שהוא , ב \" ע פרצוף עם , בינה שהוא , ג \" הס נזדווג שבסבתם , ג \" הס אל . שמה שעלה מטבור שלמטה , ן \" הזו לצורך חדש אור ג \" להס ששם . ק \" דא מטבור למטה , למקומם וירדו חזרו , הזה חדש אור ק \" דא ן \" הזו שקבלו ואחר של דגדלות המוחין והוא . דנקודים ס \" הע תוך החדש אור את והאירו . דנקודים ס \" הע נמצאים הרשימות שהם , דרשימות ' הב המין על שיצאו , דגדלות ס \" הע נתבאר והנה . דנקודים ס \" הע , הכלים לשבירת גרמו האלו דגדלות המוחין אמנם .( א \" ע אות ) ק \" דא מטבור שלמטה ן \" דזו . להלן ש \" כמ 81) We already know that AB is the Partzuf Hochma and SAG is the Partzuf Bina. They are defined according to their highest prop- erty. AB has the Aviut Gimel; hence, it is called Hochma. SAG has Aviut Bet, called Bina. When the Reshimot ZON de Guf (ZA and Malchut) rise from under the Tabur up to the Rosh de SAG (Bina), this process is called raising MAN to SAG. There, a Zivug between the SAG and the AB (between Bina and Hochma) is made, which results in the transfer of the Ohr Hochma from AB to SAG. After ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva) receive the “new light”, they descend under the Tabur again to shine upon the 10 Sefirot of the world of Nikudim, which leads to the emergence of the 10 Sefirot of Gadlut de Nikudim. However, we will find out later that just these 10 Sefirot contributed to the breaking of the vessels. The Creator created only the “desire to receive” delight. The amount of light filling each of these desires determines the essence of the Partzuf . All the Partzuf . All the Partzuf Sefirot of each Partzuf possess the qualities that correspond Partzuf possess the q ualities that corr espond Partzuf to its essence. For example, the 10 Sefirot of the Partzuf AB are ruled by its highest property of Hochma . Keter in Keter in Keter AB has the property of Hochma , so does Hochma de AB , etc. In the Partzuf SAG (Bina), the highest Sefira Keter already has the property of Bina , and not Hochma as in AB . The Reshimot that the Nekudot de SAG received from the NHYM de Galgalta (ZA) demand Ohr Hochma , which SAG (Bina) does not have."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 304 Therefore, SAG turns to AB, receives Ohr Hochma, and makes a Zivug on it. According to the demand of the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel of NHYM de Galgalta , the light from this Zivug must spread from the Zivug mus t spr ead fr om the Zivug Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur lowest point (the law of TA ). From here, the world of Nikudim receives Gadlut by adding the AHP to itself, i.e., now it consists of 10 full AHP t o itself, i.e., no w it consis ts of 1 0 full AHP Sefirot and uses all its desires. Tzimtzum Bet represents the state where one may just passively observe, refusing to receive anything. If you can hold out in such a state without using your vessels of reception, then you are in Katnut . It means that you work only with the vessels of bestowal. In this state, you are somehow connected with the Creator, since He does not receive anything either. Hence, these ten Sefirot of yours are filled with the Ohr Hassadim . Galgalta and AB received by bestowing upon the Creator. SAG al- ready could not receive, just gave, or, rather, could passively exist in the spiritual space. Nekudot de SAG , being a part of SAG , also passively exist and do not want to receive anything. However, when a pleasure that is bigger than their screen (with the Reshimot Bet/Bet ) can cope with (the Reshimot Gimel/Bet ) comes their way, they catch this desire, being unable to resist it. Any Partzuf is egoistic, but the screen that withstands egoism pro- tects the Partzuf from receiving for its own sake, by the power it has. As Partzuf fr om r eceiving f or its o wn sak e, b y the po w er it has. As Partzuf the Partzuf meets with delight Dalet/Gimel , the screen instantly loses its strength and has no other option but to become a slave of its own desires and submit to them. The difference between Katnut and Gadlut lies in the fact that, in the state of Katnut, the Partzuf activates only a half of its Kelim (GE) , and correspondingly, if the Kelim Netzah-Hod-Yesod ( the AHP) are missing, then the Gar of the lights are absent too. Even if there had been no Gar of the lights ar e absent t oo. Ev en if ther e had been no Gar TB and a Zivug on the middle line, there would not have been the Zivug on the middle line, ther e w ould no t ha v e been the Zivug Aleph de Aviut and the Bet de Hitlabshut on the level defined as the Ohr Hassadim . This state is called “Katnut” ."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 305 The Aviut Gimel is used in Gadlut , which is defined as the Kli for the Ohr Hochma . In this case, TB is cancelled, since it allows only the use of the Kelim of bestowal. In other words, Gadlut means being filled with the Ohr Hochma . The pure (clear) parts of the Kli are called the Panim , i.e., the Kelim de Ashpa’a , the desires of bestowal. The state wherein only such Kelim are present (where the screen for using the more egoistic desires (Achoraim) is unavailable) is called “Katnut” . However, when there is a screen for the Kelim de Achoraim , the desire to receive the Ohr Hochma , i.e., the Inner Light called the light of Gadlut, enters the Kli . , ולפיכך . א \" ואו כתר הנקראות , דנקודים בראש מדרגות ' ב שיש , ד \" ע באות לעיל ונתבאר ( פב הכתר אל תחילה האיר , דנקודים ס \" הע אל ג \" ס ב \" דע החדש אור את ק \" דא ן \" הזו כשהאירו . דכלים ן \" וזו ובינה דאורות ר \" בג והשלימו , הכתר מלביש ששם , ק \" דא טבורו דרך דנקודים ר \" בג והשלימם , א \" או מלבישים ששם , ק \" דא היסוד דרך דנקודים א \" או אל האיר כ \" ואח . דכלים ן \" וזו ובינה דאורות 82) We already know that there are two heads in the world of Niku- dim: Keter and Abba ve Ima. When the new light of Hochma (AB- SAG) from the Rosh de SAG (requested by the ZON de Galgalta) begins to shine upon the ten Sefirot de Nikudim, it first enters the Rosh de Keter via the Tabur de AK. The world of Nikudim fills the Rosh de Keter with the light of Gar and elevates Sefirot Bina and ZON (i.e., AHP) de Keter, which have so far been in the Rosh de Abba ve Ima. Then the light AB-SAG enters the Rosh de Abba ve Ima of the world of Nikudim via Yesod de AK, fills them with the light of Gar and elevates Sefirot Bina and ZON de Abba ve Ima, which have been in the Gar de Guf. Thus, both heads, Keter and Abba ve Ima, enter the state of Gadlut. We see that the request rising from ZON , the creation’s appeal to the Creator about getting strength for receiving the light for His sake, for the first time appears after TB . Ahead, we will observe the constant requests of the lower Partzuf to the upper one; we will see this connection Partzuf t o the upper one; w e will see this connection Partzuf"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 306 that allows them to be incorporated into the entire system of the Uni- verse, become similar to it, and become permanent partners with it. In spirituality, a desire is considered existing if it can be used for the Creator’s sake, i.e., for giving. If such an intention is absent, one may say the desire is non-existent, since it is suppressed by the Partzuf . Any Partzuf . An y Partzuf Partzuf consists of 10 Partzuf consis ts of 1 0 Partzuf Sefirot , 10 desires, but if it works only with one of them, then, in fact, only this particular desire exists. The rest do not, because they take no part in reception. In Gadlut the desires Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut join the de- sires Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet (Katnut) . These de- sires become active because they acquired the anti-egoistic screen. When the lower part of Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut ( AHP ( AHP ( of each AHP of eac h AHP Partzuf ) are inactive, there is no schematic description of Partzuf ) ar e inactiv e, ther e is no sc hematic descrip tion of Partzuf them. Each Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Nikudim has only GE , while its AHP (Awzen, Hotem, Peh) descend to the lower Partzuf and are, as it were, con- Partzuf and ar e, as it w er e, con- Partzuf cealed inside its GE , which are dressed on them. This means that, as the light AB-SAG fills the GE of the upper Partzuf and then descends to the Partzuf and then descends t o the Partzuf GE of the lower one, the light enters the AHP at the same time, which AHP at the same time, whic h AHP means the equivalence of the properties of GE of the upper Partzuf with Partzuf with Partzuf the AHP of the lower one.

It hap- pens owing to the presence in both of them of the intention to give to the same upper Partzuf . The commonness of the intention also remains Partzuf .

Its formation AHP of the upper one is ne w in the cr eation. Its f ormation AHP depends on man’s spiritual prayer, while both the upper and the lower Partzufim are the Creator’s work."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 307 Thus, the lower Partzuf can rise to a higher level with the help of Partzuf can rise t o a higher lev el with the help of Partzuf the upper one, which temporarily likened itself (its properties) to the lower one. The same laws apply to the souls. The main thing is to feel the upper Partzuf inside, do everything in your power for establishing con- Partzuf inside, do ev er ything in y our po w er f or es t ablishing con - Partzuf tact and merging with it, so that, when it starts lifting its AHP attached AHP att ac hed AHP to your GE, it will elevate you as well. When the AHP of the upper AHP of the upper AHP Partzuf descends to the Partzuf descends t o the Partzuf GE of the lower and merges with it, this combination takes place only from the point of view of the upper Partzuf . Now the lower Partzuf . N o w the lo w er Partzuf Partzuf has to put ef- Partzuf has t o put ef- Partzuf fort into merging with it, preferring contact with the Creator, despite the emptiness it feels in the AHP of the upper AHP of the upper AHP Partzuf .

We can see it in the example of the granting of the Torah. The desires GE in the Partzuf (in man) are those that strive for the Creator. Partzuf (in man) ar e those that s triv e f or the Cr eat or . Partzuf They are called Israel (from the Hebrew words “ Yashar El ” – “straight to the Creator”). The entire process of their emergence, correction and filling is described in the Torah. This book is a manual for the spiritual work. All that is written in it happens inside man’s desires, in his heart, in the point that represents his true “I” and longs only for merging with the Creator. It is a major delusion to perceive this book as a collection of sto- ries, although the historical facts also took place, since everything in our world is a reflection of the spiritual worlds in man’s heart. At the foot of Mount Sinai, only the Torah (the light of correction), emanating from the AHP of the upper AHP of the upper AHP Partzuf was granted. Israel ( Partzuf w as gr ant ed. Isr ael ( Partzuf GE of the lower Partzuf ) Partzuf ) Partzuf is yet unable to accept it. The Torah was given, but not yet received.

This example demonstrates the fundamental difference between the descent of the AHP of the upper Partzuf into the Partzuf i n t o t h e Partzuf GE of the lower and the state, where thanks to their own efforts, GE merge with this AHP, so that the upper Partzuf will be able to fill all of them with the light of the Purpose of Creation. יש כי , הוא והענין . דנקודים ס \" הע אל הזה חדש אור שגרם , הגדלות ענין תחילה ונבאר ( פג שיצאו משום , ק \" ו בבחינת היו דנקודים א \" ואו הכתר שקומת , ד \" ע באות ש \" מ על להקשות נתחברה , ק \" דא מטבור למטה ג \" דס הנקודות ירידת י \" שע , אמרנו והלא . א \" דבחי עביות על . דעביות ד \" בחי של רשימו גם הזה במסך יש הרי . בינה שהוא ג \" דס דנקודות במסך ד \" הבחי , היחידה ואור כתר בקומת ס \" ע , ג \" הס בראש התכללותו בעת , המסך על לצאת צריך היה כ \" וא ? א \" באו ראש בלי ק \" ו וקומת , הכתר בספירת דבינה ק \" ו קומת ולא נעלמה , עינים נקבי שהיא , בבינה נכללה ד \" שהבחי מתוך כי ! גורם המקום כי : היא והתשובה על רק , הזווג נעשה לא כ \" וע . שם שאיננה כמו ודומה , הבינה בפנימיות ד \" דבחי העביות שם ולא ( ד \" ע אות ) לבד דבינה המסך מעצם שהם , דעביות א \" ובחי דהתלבשות ב \" דבחי הרשימות . גמורים ק \" וו דבינה ק \" ו : הקומות ' ב אלו אלא שם יצאו 83) First, let us find out what Gadlut is, the transition that was caused by the spreading of the new light (AB-SAG) into the ten Se- firot of the world of Nikudim. We should point out that the levels Keter and Abba ve Ima de Nikudim were on the level of the VAK, since their Aviut was Aleph. However, we previously said that, dur- ing the descent of Nekudot de SAG under the Tabur, they were mixed with Dalet/Gimel of the NHYM de Galgalta, which means that the Masach that rose to the Peh de Rosh has the Reshimo Dalet. Therefore, after such a Zivug in the Rosh de SAG, ten Sefirot de Nikudim of the level of Keter with the light of Yechida were supposed to emerge there, and not the VAK de Bina. The fact is that, due to the inclusion of the Behina Dalet into Bina de Nikvey Eynaim, Behina Dalet takes no part in a Zivug; it, as it were, disappears as regards Bina. Moreover, a Zivug took place not in the Peh de SAG, but rose higher, to the Nikvey Eynaim. Here, TB occurred on Bet de Hitlabshut and Aleph de Aviut, which is the essence of the Masach de Bina. Two levels emerged from this Zivug:"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 309 the VAK de Bina (Bet de Hitlabshut) and the complete VAK (Aleph de Aviut, the level of ZA). שלהם ן \" המ י \" ע החדש האור את המשיכו מטבור שלמטה ק \" דא ן \" שהזו אחר , עתה ולפיכך ( פד אין ק \" דא ב \" ע שפרצוף מתוך הנה ,( א \" פ אות ) דנקודים לראש אותו והאירו , ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" מע שלו כשהאור כ \" ע , עינים נקבי למקום ד \" הבחי את שהעלה , הזה ' ב בצמצום נגיעה שום לו והוריד . עינים לנקבי הזווג מקום שהעלה ,' ב הצמצום את בו וביטל חזר , דנקודים לראש נמשך . דראש הפה במקום דהיינו ,' הא הצמצום בעת שהיתה כמו , לפה למקומה ד \" הבחי את בחזרה עתה הנה ,( ו \" ע אות ) מהמדרגה נפלו ' הב צמצום שמסבת , ופה חוטם אוזן הכלים ' ג ונמצאו ד \" הבחי אל עינים מנקבי הזווג מקום שוב ירד ואז . כבתחילה למדרגתם למקומם ועלו חזרו והנה . כתר בקומת ס \" ע שם יצאו , במקומה היא כבר ד \" שהבחי ומאחר . דראש הפה במקום נשמה האורות ' ג הרויח , דנקודים הראש אל ק \" דא ן \" הזו שהמשיך , החדש אור י \" שע , נתבאר . מתחילה יציאתו בעת לו חסרים שהיו , ן \" וזו בינה שהם , פ \" אח הכלים ' וג , יחידה חיה 84) Now, after the ZON de AK, which positioned under the Tabur, attracted the new light from the AB-SAG by raising MAN, this light shone on the Rosh de Nikudim and cancelled TB for the lack of any connection between the Partzuf AB and the TB (it originated in TA). Behina Dalet de AK under the Tabur, which rose to the Nikvey Eynaim after TB, now returned to the Peh de Rosh, as in TA. Hence, the vessels AHP in the Rosh de SAG, which descended from under the screen due to TB, now rose again and took their previous position under the vessels of GE, while the place of Zivug descended from Nikvey Eynaim to Peh de Rosh, Behina Dalet. The return of Behina Dalet to its place led to the emergence of the Partzuf of the level of Keter with the light of Yechida. Thus, with the help of the new light, the Partzuf gained three more kinds of the Ohr Hochma: Neshama, Haya and Yechida, and the vessels Bina and ZON that were absent in it in the state of Katnut. The principal task is to fill Malchut of the World of Infinity com- pletely with the light. Malchut represents the Galgalta . If it were filled with the light from the Peh to the Tabur and from the Tabur and fr om the Tabur Tabur down to the Tabur do wn t o the Tabur Sium , the Final Correction would come. However, according to the law of TA , only a part of Malchut from the Peh to the Tabur can be filled with Tabur can be f illed with Tabur"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 310 the light so far. Filling Malchut with the light from the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Sium, with the help of TA , a usual Zivug de Aka’a is simply impossible. Neither Galgalta , nor AB nor any of the subsequent Partzufim , whose screen was even weaker than that of the Galgalta , could do that. The only way is to somehow liken the properties of Malchut to those of Bina, mix the egoistic vessels of NHYM de Galgalta with the altruistic vessels of the SAG (Bina) , receive their altruistic properties, and gradually start filling the corrected vessels with the light. Being the intermediate Partzuf between Partzuf be tw een Partzuf Bina ( the SAG) and ZA (the MA , the world of Nikudim ), the Nekudot de SAG , on the one hand, have the properties of Bina ; on the other hand, the Aviut Aleph . Hence, it has also the properties of ZA or, rather, VAK , so it is somewhat similar to the NHYM de Galgalta (ZA) . That is why just the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG proves useful to achieve that goal – filling Malchut of the World of In- finity with the light under the Tabur . It descended under the Tabur and Tabur and Tabur filled the NHYM de Galgalta with the Ohr Hassadim . Then, as we already know, since the “desire to receive” for one’s sake was activated in the lower part of Nekudot de SAG , Tzimtzum Aleph snapped into action. Malchut instantly rose to Tifferet (Bina de Guf) and restricted reception of the light in the lower two thirds of it and in the NHY . The new restriction received the name Tzimtzum Bet and divided each level into Gar and Gar and Gar Zat, GE and AHP . The result of TB is that all the properties are mixed. SAG acquires egoistic properties and Malchut – altruistic vessels. This general mix of properties constitutes the world of Nikudim in Katnut , which says that now only the altruistic desires (GE) may be used. In fact, the world of Nikudim also consists of ten Sefirot , but of all these ten desires, it may use only the altruistic ones; hence, they say it has only GE . After the emergence of the world of Nikudim in the state of Katnut (the screen is in the Nikvey Eynaim, the Reshimot Bet/Aleph ), its ZON raise MAN on MAN on MAN Reshimot Dalet/Gimel asking for the filling of their desires."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 311 To receive the Ohr Hochma and pass it on to the ZON , SAG turns to AB , since AB has a sufficiently strong screen to work with the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel. Light AB-SAG passes through the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Rosh de Keter and Rosh de Keter and Rosh de Keter Rosh de Abba ve Ima of the world of Nikudim , dictating its properties. It annuls TB , elevates AHP to AHP t o AHP GE in the Rosh de Keter and Rosh de Keter and Rosh de Keter Abba ve Ima, and then makes them enter the state of Gadlut . The light corrects and fills the vessels. The correction of our souls will take place in a similar fashion, with the help of the raising of MAN . There are just three components in this process: the egoistic “desire to receive” created by the Creator, the screen and the light. Malchut of the World of Infinity slowly moves through the entire process of transition from the first state (of being completely filled with the light) to the third state (the Gmar Tikkun ) during 6000 years or levels. This process represents the second stage of gradual correction of the vessels and fills them with portions of the light. Kabbalah is a practical science that deals with the filling of desires with the light. Like other sci- ences, it possesses its special instrument called the screen and the meth- ods for building it, the so-called “Birur” (analysis) and the “Tikkun” (cor- rection). The screen is not just an instrument, or the vessel to be filled; it also contains the Reshimot – the information about the previous state. We have never heard of the additional light that comes and allows the vessel to transform itself. The Partzuf in the state of Partzuf in the s t at e of Partzuf Katnut , filled with the Ohr Hassadim is unable to change anything by itself, give birth to a new state. Only the Partzuf filled with the Partzuf f illed with the Partzuf Ohr Hochma can do this. Galgalta above the Tabur has exhausted all its Tabur has e xhaus t ed all its Tabur Reshimot because of Zivugim , on which the five Partzufim of the world of AK emerged. Now AK emer ged. N o w AK the world of Nikudim in Katnut is under the Tabur , together with the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel on four unused desires after TB . These vessels want to receive the light, since they feel that their desires are not filled. They demand the Ohr Hochma from the upper Partzuf . However, the vessel Partzuf .

To correct the vessels of the world of Nikudim , SAG turns to AB , receives the Ohr Hochma from it, then passes the combined light Hochma- Hassadim (AB-SAG) to Nikudim . This light is not pleasure; it is the light of correction, which means that it allows even the egoistic vessels to receive for the sake of the Creator. How can such a light enter the egoistic vessels when the law of TA , which forbids the light from entering the Kli without the Masach , is ef- fective? The Light AB-SAG acts in the following way: it allows the vessel to see the Creator’s greatness from afar. This sensation of significance of spirituality lets the vessel act in an altruistic way. The Ohr AB-SAG is a very specific kind of light that we will discuss later. Having no Ohr Hochma , the SAG turns to AB . The Ohr AB-SAG is the light that corrects the creation. In order to be corrected, one needs to know what correction is, what it means to be filled with wisdom and knowledge. The Light AB-SAG contains all this information. Both the light of AB and SAG are necessary to show the lower Partzuf the entire Partzuf the entir e Partzuf diversity of the spiritual attainment. From the state of complete emptiness, performing each new action for the sake of the Creator, Malchut of the World of Infinity accumulates more and more altruistic properties. These are the Partzufim Galgalta , AB and SAG . Seemingly, it should get closer and closer to the Creator. The birth of each new Partzuf is like a manifestation of a new altruistic Partzuf is lik e a manif es t ation of a ne w altruis tic Partzuf property of Malchut . Yet in reality, each new action moves Malchut away from the Creator. Perhaps it is drawing nearer and not moving away? On the one hand, the more distant the Partzuf is from the Creator, the more inde- Partzuf is fr om the Cr eat or , the mor e inde- Partzuf pendent it becomes. On the other hand, there lies its weakness; it loses contact with the Creator, and feels less of the power of His light."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 313 Every action in the spiritual world is either perfect or must approxi- mate perfection. Now Malchut realizes the Creator’s goal: to be com- pletely filled with His light.Hence, each new action is supposed to draw it nearer to this goal and must be better than the previous. The vessels’ properties become more and more revealed. Malchut moves farther away from the Creator, but from the point of its self-knowledge, it is a very positive process. However, one can come to know oneself only with the help of the powerful light, whereas each subsequent Partzuf contains less Partzuf cont ains less Partzuf and less of it. A phenomenon can be properly examined only by summarizing all actions. Everything should be looked upon from the viewpoint of the creation, i.e., Malchut of the World of Infinity. First, turning into new worlds and Partzufim , it moves farther and farther away from the Cre- ator. Then, reaching the point of our world and turning into the human soul, it starts ascending, being the initiator of all actions. The actions performed from above refer exclusively to the Creator. שהיא , ת \" ה את שהעלה ,' הב צמצום אשר . דנקודים והגדלות הקטנות היטב ונתבאר ( פה א \" ז או ק \" ו קומת שהוא , דנקודים הקטנות לקומת גרם , שם ונגנזה , עינים נקבי למקום , ד \" בחי ביאת י \" וע . דאורות יחידה חיה ונשמה דכלים ן \" וזו בינה שם חסרים והיו , רוח דנפש באורות דכלים ן \" וזו הבינה וחזרו . למקומו ' א הצמצום חזר , הנקודים אל ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" דע חדש אור .\" פה \" הנקראת , למלכות למקומה וחזרה עינים מנקבי ירדה ת \" ה כי , לראש י \" הנרנח ונשלמו . ויחידה כתר בקומת ס \" הע ויצאו . למקומה שחזרה , ד \" בחי על הזווג נעשה ואז בשם והקטנות ' ב להצמצום נכנה : ואילך מכאן הקיצור ולשם . דכלים ן \" זו ב \" והכח דאורות , ג \" ס ב \" דע אור ביאת בשם נכנה הגדלות ואת ,\" למטה פ \" אח וירידת עינים לנקבי ת \" ה עלית \" . למקומם פ \" האח ומחזיר עינים מנקבי ת \" ה המוריד בשם מכונים דגוף ס \" והע , דראש ן \" זו ב \" כח ס \" דע שמות הם פ \" ואח ע \" שגו תמיד תזכור גם החזה עד ת \" דת עליון ושליש וגבורה החסד כי , פ \" ואח ע \" גו לפי נחלקים הם וגם . מ \" נהי ת \" חג . פ \" אח הם ם \" ונהי ת \" ת ש \" וב , עינים ונקבי ועינים גלגלתא הם - ש \" ב או פ \" ואח , דפנים כלים מכונים הם החזה עד ת \" חג או ע \" ונ ועינים שגלגלתא , תזכור גם שנעשה , המדרגה בקיעת ענין תזכור וכן , דאחורים כלים מכונים ולמטה שמחזה מ \" ונהי ת \" ת בפנימיותו יש , תחתון וכל . לבד דפנים הכלים רק מדרגה בכל נשאר לא אשר ,' ב צמצום עם .( ז \" ע אות ) העליון של דאחורים הכלים"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 314 85) We have cleared up the meaning of Katnut and Gadlut of the world of Nikudim, where TB lifted Malchut to Nikvey Eynaim and concealed it there. This caused the emergence of the world of Niku- dim in Katnut. This is the state in which the vessels Keter, Hochma and Gar de Bina are filled with the lights Nefesh and Ruach, while the vessels the Zat de Bina and ZON, and the lights Neshama, Haya, and Yechida are absent. Then, as the new light AB-SAG de- scends from the world AK to the world of Nikudim, TA returns; as a result, the vessels Zat de Bina and ZON in the Rosh joined the upper vessels and the screen descended from Nikvey Eynaim to Peh. Then a Zivug is made on Behina Dalet, which returned to its posi- tion in Peh de Rosh. This leads to the formation of ten Sefirot of the level of Keter. From this moment, TB and Katnut are defined as the ascent of Malchut to Nikvey Eynaim and the downfall of AHP. The state of Gadlut is characterized by the appearance of the light AB-SAG, the descent of Malchut to its previous position (as in TA) and the rise of AHP. As was stated above, GE and AHP are names of the 10 Sefirot KaHaB ZON de Rosh. The 10 Sefirot de Guf are corresponding- ly called the HaGaT NHYM, which in turn consist of their GE (Hesed, Gevura and the upper third of Tifferet down to the Chazeh) and the AHP (two lower thirds of Tifferet and NHYM). You should also remember that GE (HaGaT down to the Chazeh) is also called the Panim (face, front part), and the AHP (two thirds of Tifferet and the NHYM) is called the Achoraim (back part). You should not forget about the division of the levels after TB, when only GE remained on each level, while the AHP fell into the GE of the lower level, whose AHP in turn fell to the GE of the level below, etc."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 315 T H E N E K U D O T : H O L A M , S H U R U K , H I R I K חירק שורק חולם הנקודות ' ג ביאור , לאותיות שממעל , עליונות נקודות : שהם , סוף תוך ראש בחינות ' לג נחלקות שהנקודות , דע ( פו ,\" מלאפום \" או \" שורק \" בשם הנכללות , האותיות שבתוך , אמצעיות ונקודות ,\" חולם \" בשם הנכללות .\" חירק \" בשם הנכללות , האותיות שמתחת , תחתונות ונקודות , נקודה ובתוכה ' ו דהיינו 86) You must know that there are three kinds of Nekudot (dots, points): the Rosh, the Toch and the Sof. The upper Nekudot, posi- tioned above the Hebrew letter as dots, are called Rosh, or Holam . The middle Nekudot inside the letters, as in Vav with a dot, is called Toch, or Shuruk . The lower Nekudot, placed under the letters, are called Sof, or Hirik . What does this mean in the spiritual world? The letters are the vessels, while the dots are the lights. If the dot is above the letter, it sym- bolizes the light that has not yet entered the vessel, but is destined to do so in the future. This kind of a dot is called Holam . If the dot is inside the vessel, in its Toch, it is called Shuruk . If the dot left the vessel and is under it, it is called Hirik . רק הם דראש ס \" הע כי . דגוף הספירות דהיינו , כלים פירושם אותיות כי . ביאורם וזה ( פז . אותם ומנענעים הכלים את המחיים , אורות פירושם ונקודות . ממש כלים ולא לכלים שרשים ג \" ס ב \" מע קבלו ק \" דא ן \" שהזו , חדש אור בחינת והוא .\" חיה אור \" הנקרא , החכמה אור והיינו את להמדרגה והשיבו , מדרגה דכל לפה בחזרה ת \" ה את והורידו , דנקודים להכלים והאירו מהמדרגה אותם ומעלה פ \" דאח הכלים מנענע הזה שאור הרי . דאורות ר \" וג דכלים פ \" האח וזה .\" להאותיות המנענעות נקודות \" ס \" שז , כבתחילה לעליונה אותם ומחבר , שלמטה י \" ע פ \" דאח הכלים לאותם מחיה הוא כ \" ע , חיה אור שהוא , ק \" דא ב \" מע נמשך להיותו האור . בתוכם התלבשותו 87) The letters constitute the vessels, i.e., the Sefirot de Guf. The ten Sefirot de Rosh are called the roots of the vessels. The Nekudot are the lights that animate these vessels. Hence, the Ohr Hochma is called the light of life (Ohr Haya). This new light AB-SAG passes through the ZON of the world of AK. It then shines upon the vessels of the world of Nikudim, causes Malchut to descend from Nikvey"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 316 Eynaim to Peh on each level, and thus brings the AHP back. As a result, all the lights return to their places. This light moves the Kelim from the state of TB to the state of TA, from Katnut to Gadlut. Accordingly, the light AB-SAG animates and arouses the vessels by dressing into them. In the Katnut de Nikudim, Abba ve Ima dressed on the AHP de Keter, the ZON dressed on the ZON dr essed on the ZON AHP de Abba ve Ima , and the AHP de ZON were AHP de ZON w er e AHP de ZON under the Parsa . This state appeared after a Zivug in Zivug in Zivug Nikvey Eynaim of the Rosh de SAG . Now, under the influence of the new light AB-SAG , the screen in Rosh de SAG descended from Nikvey Eynaim to the Peh de Rosh and made a Zivug with the Zivug with the Zivug Ohr Hochma of AB . First, the light descended to the Rosh de Keter and attached the Rosh de Keter and att ac hed the Rosh de Keter AHP and the light of AHP and the light of AHP Gar to Gar t o Gar Keter . This light let the vessel understand what the Creator means. The vessel is totally imbued with altruism and is now able to work with all of its ten desires, making a Zivug de Haka’a on them. Thus, the vessel passes from Katnut to Gadlut . דרך : מקומות ' ב דרך דנקודים ס \" להע הזה החדש אור את האירו ק \" דא ן \" שהזו , ידעת וכבר ( פח הטבור דרך שהארה , ותדע . דנקודים א \" לאו האיר היסוד ודרך , דנקודים להכתר האיר הטבור . מהם מלמעלה לאותיות המאיר ,\" חולם \" בשם מכונה דראש הזכר קומת שהוא , דנקודים לכתר אלא מגיע אינו הטבור שהארת , מטעם והוא דגוף הכלים שהם , הנקודים של ת \" לז מתפשט אינו הזכר וקומת .( ד \" ע אות ) הנקודים מתפשט ואינו למעלה ממקומו רק אליהם מאיר שהוא נבחן לפיכך .\" אותיות \" שנקראים עומדת שהיא נקודה עם ' ו דהיינו .\" שורק \" בשם מכונה היסוד דרך וההארה . עצמם באותיות דראש הנקבה קומת שהם , דנקודים א \" לאו מגיע זו הארה כי , והטעם . האותיות שורת תוך כ \" וע .\" אותיות \" הנקראים , דנקודים ת \" הז שהם , לגוף גם מתפשטים שאורותיה , הנקודים . האותיות שורת תוך השורק נקודת נמצא 88) We already know that ZON of the world of AK affected the ten Sefirot de Nikudim with the new light in two ways: through the Tabur, it shone upon Keter de Nikudim, and through Yesod – upon Abba ve Ima de Nikudim. You should know that the light passing through the Tabur is called Holam. It shines above the letters only in"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 317 Keter, representing the level of Zachar (active male essence), or Hit- labshut, and cannot spread to the vessels of the Guf, called letters. That is why it is considered to be shining only above the letters with- out spreading inside them. The light passing through Yesod is called Shuruk, Vav with a dot, which means it is inside the letters and enters Abba ve Ima, the female essence of the Rosh de Nikudim. This light also spreads in the Guf, i.e., the Zat de Nikudim, called letters. Thus, the Nekudat Shuruk is inside the letters. When we look at the Hebrew alphabet of the Torah , we will see that there are many dots inside of letters (not just Vav with a dot): for example, Pey and Fey , Bet and Vet . Mem and Tav can also have dots. All these laws derive from the rules of the spiritual world. Later we will study the Hebrew alphabet, which actually originates in Bina, ZA and Malchut of the world of Atzilut , and fully correspond to the ZON and the ZON and the ZON AHP de Abba ve Ima of the world of Nikudim . The first letters from Aleph to Tet are in Bina , the letters from Chav to Tzadik are in ZA , the last four letters: Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav are in Malchut . Every dot, whether over the letters (crowns), inside the letters, or under them, speaks only about the spiritual state of the Partzuf . Every Partzuf . Ev er y Partzuf word in Hebrew says something about the Universe and signifies the re- ception of some spiritual light in the vessel. The combination of the ves- sel and the light is expressed in a code called “word”. This code contains all relations between the light and the vessel, the screen, Aviut etc. Each letter of the alphabet carries a tremendous amount of infor- mation in its shape, the relation to the previous letter. This information points exclusively at spiritual actions. When man pronounces a word, he expresses his feelings in each letter; they register in the screen and speak about the spiritual level of the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf In our world, we do not feel the spiritual conformity between the vessel and the light. While using a language, we do not understand the inner spiritual meaning of the words that come from the Torah, which"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 318 carry clear spiritual information. It is impossible to call something by a different name. For example, the word Maim, which consists of two let- ters, Mem (one of which is terminal – Sofit ) and certain dots, precisely expresses the essence of water; so does each word. Kabbalists are known to perform some actions with the letters. This does not at all mean they write something on parchment or paper. When they say that Kabbalists operate with letters, it means that they perform strictly spiritual actions, i.e., they fill their vessels with the help of the screen and the Reflected Light. No eye can see these actions. ת \" ה המוריד , הטבור דרך חדש אור הארת אשר . והשורק החולם היטב נתבארו והנה ( פט שממעל , החולם נקודת סוד הוא , דכתר פ \" האח בחזרה ומעלה , לפה דכתר עינים מנקבי ומשיב , שלהם להפה א \" דאו עינים מנקבי ת \" ה המוריד , היסוד דרך חדש אור והארת . לאותיות ת \" בז גם באים אלו שמוחין מטעם . האותיות שבתוך , השורק נקודת ס \" ה , פ \" האח את להם .\" אותיות \" הנקראים , דנקודים 89), We have learned the meaning of the dots Holam and Shur- uk. The luminescence of the new light passing through the Tabur, which lowers the screen from Nikvey Eynaim de Rosh of Keter to its Peh and returns the AHP de Keter to its level, is called Nekudat Holam. The luminescence of the new light passing through Yesod lowers the screen from Nikvey Eynaim de Abba ve Ima to the Peh and returns their AHP de Keter to its place. This light shines inside the letters and is called Shuruk. These Mochin (the light of Gar) also spread to the Zat de Nikudim, called letters, i.e., the vessels receiving this light. However, from the Rosh de Abba ve Ima (called the Rosh de Aviut as distinct from the Rosh de Keter called the Rosh de Keter called the Rosh de Keter Rosh de Hitlabshut ), the light spreads to the Guf de ZON . ת \" ה בחינת להוריד , א \" מאו מקבלים עצמם ת \" שהז , חדש האור בחינת הוא , החירק וסוד ( צ פ \" האח אליהם חוזרים ז \" שעי . ק \" א רגלי סיום מקום אל , שלהם בחזה העומדת , המסיימת כמו להיות ע \" הבי יוחזרו אז אשר . ע \" בי למקום שנעשו , ולמטה שמחזה הכלים שהם , שלהם . אצילות"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 319 , והפרסא ,' ב הצמצום את לגמרי ולבטל , מהחזה ת \" הה להוריד יכלו לא דנקודים ת \" הז אמנם ת \" ה כח כי . ת \" דז הכלים כל תיכף נשברו , ע \" לבי האור שהמשיכו בעת אלא . ע \" בי והמקום להסתלק תיכף מוכרח האור והיה . האלו בכלים מעורב היה , בפרסא העומדת , המסיימת למעלה העומדים , שלהם דפנים הכלים גם ונשברו . ע \" לבי ונפלו ומתו נשברו והכלים . משם ונפלו ומתו ונשברו . האור כל נסתלק מהם גם כי . ולמעלה שמחזה הכלים דהיינו , מפרסא . אחד לגוף דאחורים הכלים עם חיבורם מחמת היה וזה . ע \" לבי 90) Hirik is the new light received by Zat directly from Abba ve Ima, which lowers Malchut from the Chazeh to the Sium de AK; as a result, the AHP de ZON returns to its place from under the Parsa. These AHP de ZON formed the worlds BYA under the Parsa. So now, under the influence of the light of Hirik, these worlds are sup- posed to become similar to the world of Atzilut. However, the ZON de Nikudim could not lower Malchut from the Chazeh and completely cancel TB and the Parsa, thus changing the place of the worlds BYA. The moment the light spread to BYA, all the vessels of the Zat broke, for the law of Malchut Mesayemet (in the Chazeh) was still effective. The lights instantly left the vessels, which broke, died and fell to BYA. The Kelim de Panim also broke. Even though these vessels were under the Parsa, they wanted to unite with the AHP in one Partzuf. They also died and fell to BYA , because the light had disappeared from them. In fact, the worlds Atzilut and BYA have not been there yet, but the vessels from which they would later be created, already existed. All was well until the light disappeared from Keter and Keter a n d Keter Abba ve Ima . After the light descended under the Parsa, to the AHP de ZON , there occurred the breaking of the vessels. GE had the screen above the Parsa , which could bestow everything upon the Creator, while under the Parsa (the receiving vessels) the law restricting any reception ruled entirely, even though the “desire to receive” was concentrated there. When the light AB-SAG came, it gave the strength to the common vessel to receive this en- tire light for the sake of the Creator, and fill the NHY de Galgalta with it."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 320 However, Rosh de Keter and Abba ve Ima failed to take into account the fact that the light AB-SAG , which spread under the Parsa, would arouse the egoistic desire in the vessels present there. The fact is that not just two heads, Keter and the Keter and the Keter Abba ve Ima , maintain the Parsa , but also by the third, the YESHSUT that is under the YESHSUT that is under the YESHSUT Tabur . This very head restrains the light AB-SAG , preventing it from spreading under the Parsa . This is deliberately done to break all the vessels, deprive them of the screen, and move them as far from the Creator as possible. However, because of this, the altruistic and egoistic vessels completely mixed with one another. Now each fragment contains both the “desire to bestow” and the “desire to receive”. This was exactly what breaking of the vessels aimed at. The ZON of the world of ZON of the w orld of ZON Nikudim embodies the entire Malchut of the World of Infinity. The purpose is to fill its part under the Parsa with the Creator’s light. How can that be done? Only by the above-mentioned explosive method, when Abba ve Ima and ZON get the wrong impression ZON ge t the wr ong im pr ession ZON that they can receive the light for the Creator’s sake under Parsa. The ZON really seem to start receiving the light for the sake of the Creator, ZON r eally seem t o s t ar t r eceiving the light f or the sak e of the Cr eat or , ZON but then realize they receive it in an egoistic way. The light disappears; the vessel finds itself in a desperate situation, where not only its own properties, but also those of GE become egoistic. They fall under the Parsa and mix with the egoistic vessels. Now these fragments of the egoistic vessels have sparks of altruism. When the light shines upon them, it will arouse their altruistic sparks and correct them. אדרבה כי , הנקודים בעולם לשליטתה לצאת יכלה לא החירק שנקודת , רואה והנך ( צא מ \" בתנהי דהיינו , האותיות בתוך להתלבש שרצתה משום והיינו . הכלים לשבירת גרמה היא החירק נקודת קבלה , התיקון בעולם , כ \" אח אמנם . ע \" לבי שנעשו , דאצילות מפרסא שלמטה . האותיות מתחת להאיר נתקנה שם כי . תיקונה את ת \" ה את להוריד הצריך , א \" מאו הגדלות אור את מקבלים דאצילות ת \" שהז שבעת דהיינו והאורות , לאצילות מ \" דתנהי הכלים את ולחבר , ק \" דא רגלין לסיום החזה ממקום המסיימת הללו י \" התנה מעלים שהם אלא , כן עושים אינם - ק \" דא רגלין סיום עד למטה יתפשטו מפרסא למעלה בהיותם האורות ומקבלים . מפרסא שלמעלה האצילות מקום אל ע \" בי ממקום"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 321 , החירק שנקודת , נבחן וזה . הנקודים כבעולם כ \" שביה שוב בהם יארע שלא כדי , דאצילות , שהעלתה מ \" תנהי הכלים אלו מתחת עומדת , דאצילות ת \" דז י \" דתנה הכלים את המעלה . האותיות מתחת משמשת החירק שנקודת הרי . דאצילות הפרסא במקום שעומדת דהיינו . כלל בדרך חירק שורק חולם נקודות ' ג סוד נתבאר והנה 91) We see that the world of Nikudim was not ready to receive the light that corresponded to the point of Hirik; hence it made for the breaking of the vessels. It happened because it wanted to get inside the letters, i.e., the vessels Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut under the Parsa in the worlds of BYA. Afterwards, in the world of Correction (Atzilut), the point of Hirik is corrected and shines below the letters. When Zat of the world of Nikudim received the light of Gadlut from Abba ve Ima, which had to lower Malchut from the Chazeh to the Sium de AK and unite the vessels of the AHP with the GE de Nikudim, the light began spreading under the Parsa. This led to the breaking of the vessels. To prevent this from happening again, the corrected point of Hirik in the world of Atzilut elevates Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut from under the Parsa (the worlds BYA) to the world of Atzilut above the Parsa, and stays below them, i.e., on the level of the Parsa. Thus, we have learned the meaning of the three dots: Holam, Shuruk, and Hirik. How can the desire be elevated above the Parsa ? This becomes pos- sible only after the breaking of the vessels, when each desire of Malchut is mixed with Bina and has a chance to be corrected. This material is difficult to understand without certain inner sensations. Kabbalah is im- possible to grasp by the mind alone. If man persistently tries to do that, he commits a most serious violation. Yet, there is so far no other way out, for we have no alternative connection with spirituality. Let us review the material we have studied. We know that Neku- dot de SAG descended under the Tabur de Galgalta and mixed with the NHYM de Galgalta . Then they rose to Rosh de SAG with the Reshimot Bet/ Aleph and the information about the TB , which produced the Katnut de"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 322 Nikudim with Keter, Abba ve Ima and ZON reaching the ZON r eac hing the ZON Parsa . Keter is the Keter is the Keter Rosh de Hitlabshut , Abba ve Ima is the Rosh de Aviut and ZON is the ZON is the ZON Guf . Guf . Guf In fact, Nikudim in Katnut is not a world; it is still only a small Partz- uf . Nevertheless, it is called the world because later it will in fact appear uf . N ev er theless, it is called the w orld because lat er it will in f act appear uf there. This will happen as a result of a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimot Dalet/Gimel , which were received from the NHYM de Galgalta and were also present in the screen ascending to the Rosh de SAG . When the world of Nikudim emerge in the state of Katnut , the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel awaken in the Rosh de SAG . They now wish to re- ceive the entire Ohr Hochma destined for the vessels of Galgalta under the Tabur . Light AB-SAG descends in response to this request. The SAG demonstrates what the “desire to bestow” is; AB shows how it is possible to receive for the Creator’s sake. Both of them enable the vessel in Kat- nut to pass to the state of Gadlut . In order to receive the light AB-SAG , a Zivug is made not in Zivug is made no t in Zivug Nikvey Eynaim , but again in the Peh de Rosh , where the screen descends. First, this new light descends through the Tabur to Tabur t o Tabur Keter de Nikudim , and by fill- ing it, provides it with strength to attach its own AHP and pass to AHP and pass t o AHP Gadlut . The light cannot spread beyond Keter ( the Rosh de Hitlabshut) . It spreads to Yesod de Galgalta , where the Rosh de Abba ve Ima is dressed. Thus, the second head ( the Abba ve Ima) can receive light AB-SAG and, with its help, achieve the state of Gadlut . The light in Keter is called Holam (dot above letter). This means that the light does not spread farther than the Rosh . The light in Abba ve Ima is called Shuruk (dot inside letter). Then the light enters GE de ZON and tries to descend to AHP de ZON under the AHP de ZON under the AHP de ZON Parsa , to the egoistic vessels. If it could get under the Parsa , it would unite GE de ZON with GE de ZON with GE de ZON their AHP . However, it cannot get there to give the AHP the altruistic AHP the altruis tic AHP properties. Therefore the AHP does not join AHP does no t join AHP GE de ZON ; AHP retain their AHP r e t ain their AHP “desire to receive” for their own sake, which leads to breaking of the ves-"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 323 sels. The light disappears, since according to TA it cannot be inside ego- istic vessels. The Kelim de GE and the AHP de ZON become absolutely AHP de ZON become absolut ely AHP de ZON egoistic; having no screen, they fall under the Parsa , which means their properties are totally opposite to the Creator’s. The light that tries to get under the Parsa is called the point of Hirik . Later on, the correction takes place in the world of Atzilut . This world has the following structure. It also has Keter, Abba ve Ima and ZON . The principle of correction is quite simple. The Parsa cannot be elimi- nated. The only way is to raise the AHP (the vessels of reception) above AHP (the v essels of r ecep tion) abo v e AHP the Parsa and attach them to the GE de ZON , thus creating the ten Sefirot above the Parsa and filling them with the light. This process is called “AHP de Aliyah” – the ascending vessels of reception. This state is called the Final Correction. Afterwards, the light from above will come to eliminate the Parsa . When it is out of the way, it will lower the AHP to its place under the AHP t o its place under the AHP now non-existent Parsa . This is called the AHP Amiti’im (real AHP ) or the AHP de Yeridah (descending AHP ). Thus, the light completely fills Gal- galta down to the Sium Reglav . This light is called the Ohr HaMashiach . It corrects and fills all vessels. This correction is going on in the Universe. So where is man in this scheme? All we discuss happens for the sake of the souls that will be created later on, and which will have to go through all the levels prepared for them. Right now, the worlds seem to be the goal; man seems to have no place in them. This is not so. The worlds represent the system that controls the souls, whereas the souls can in turn control the worlds. We will talk about it later. The state where the AHP rises above the AHP rises abo v e the AHP Parsa is called “the ascent of the worlds on Shabbat and on holidays”. When the AHP is under the AHP is under the AHP Parsa , it is called “weekdays”. That is the origin of time. Why were there not any letters before the world of Atzilut ? It is be- cause there were no real vessels, just their roots. The formation of the vessel"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 324 is gradual. A clear-cut vessel-desire requires information about the Reshimo (the desire of the Kli ) and a total absence of the desired pleasure. First, the light must enter the vessel, whose desires are opposite to this light. It happens that, in the preliminary vessels, the light is primary while the vessel’s reaction to it is secondary. However, in the case where the true vessel is primary, the light is secondary. The real vessel emanates its own desire, aspiration to something, which is beyond its absolute darkness and remoteness from the Creator. When man studies Kabbalah, he knows that some previously un- known information is delivered to him: information about the light, the Sefirot , the Partzufim , the worlds etc. In order to feel it, he needs to have the screen, and then all the information turns into light, which previ- ously surrounded him. This information is all around, but there are no vessels able to perceive it so far. We should not imagine anything, for all our images will be wrong until we have the screen. If you were reading a book about delicious and healthy food recipes, you would instantly imagine the tastes and the smells of the described delicacies. Any images in Kabbalah are totally groundless if no adequate vessels are available. The plan, the Thought of Creation, all further actions, their initial and final states, are concealed in Behina Aleph of the Direct Light, its first point called Keter de Ohr Yashar. Then it develops as the four Behinot, Malchut of the World of Infinity, the world AK , the world of Nikudim , the worlds of BYA , the breaking of the vessels, Adam HaRishon etc. The properties of both the light and the vessel were determined in the Thought of Creation, so the way from the initial state to the final is known in advance. There are no unforeseen obstacles or unnecessary actions on this way, which might lead to unexpected results. Everything evolves according to a precisely planned program. Either you feel the tough influence of nature, mercilessly pushing you towards the Purpose of Creation, or you take control into your own hands and move quickly"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 325 to leave the blows behind. Thus, you accelerate the entire process. This quick movement will not be a burden to you; on the contrary, it will seem delightful. As regards the Creator, the initial point of the creation merges with the final; they continue to exist as one. As regards us, the first point gradually unfolds as a series of consecutive actions, until this way ends in its final point. No horoscopes, fortune telling, or corrections of destiny will help us to avoid blows. The light is amorphous. The vessel surrounded by the light feels more or less in accordance with its spiritual properties – the screen. There are 12 kinds of Ohr Hozer , 12 kinds of Reshimot , 10 kinds of the Ke- lim , seven kinds of Masachim, and six kinds of Ohr Yashar . In order to feel it all, one must have the appropriate vessels. For instance, when we hear the word “Lechem” (bread), we can sense its smell, its taste. What do we sense when words such as “Ohr”, “Reshimo” or “Kli” are pronounced? ... The Gadlut of the world of Nikudim symbolizes the Gmar Tik- kun , when the light fills the AHP de ZON , but it will happen in the sensations of the souls. The state wherein each soul can correct itself is called its birth."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 326 R A I S I N G O F M A N O F Z A T D E N I K U D I M T O A B B A V E I M A דנקודים ת \" דז ן \" מ עלית ענין הדעת ספירת וביאור א \" לאו יציאת לעת דהיינו ,' ב בצמצום שנעשה , עינים לנקבי ת \" ה עלית שבסבת , נתבאר כבר ( צב במדרגה נשארים - ועינים גלגלתא : חצאים ' לב מדרגה כל נחלקה , דנקודים ס \" דע הקטנות , שמתחתיה להמדרגה מהמדרגה הנפולים - פה חוטם ואזן ,\" דפנים כלים \" זה משום ונקראים מפנימיות כפולה נעשית ומדרגה מדרגה שכל , באופן .\" דאחורים כלים \" זה משום נקראים ונמצאים . עצמה של דפנים הכלים בפנימיות נפלו דעליונה דאחורים הכלים באשר , וחיצוניות א \" דאו הנפולים פ \" ואח , א \" דאו ועינים גלגלתא תוך מלובשים נקודים דכתר הנפולים פ \" אח .( ו \" ע אות ) דנקודים ת \" דז ועינים גלגלתא תוך מלובשים 92) We have already explained that, because of Malchut rising to Nikvey Eynaim (caused by TB) and the emergence of the world of Nikudim in Katnut, each level divided into two parts. GE, remain on their level and are therefore called Kelim de Panim, and AHP, which fall from their level to the lower one and are called Kelim de Achoraim. Thus, each level now consists of inner and outer parts. The AHP de Keter of the world of Nikudim is inside the GE de Abba ve Ima. The AHP de Abba ve Ima fell into the GE de ZON of the world of Nikudim. So, starting from TB , each level consisting of 10 Sefirot is divided into GE , which include Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura and the up- per third of Tifferet , and the AHP that include the lower third of AHP that include the lo w er thir d of AHP Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yeso d and Malchut . The light can enter the upper part (the GE ), which may be used. The AHP cannot receive the light and these desires may not be used. The AHP canno t r eceiv e the light and these desir es ma y no t be used . The AHP upper Sefirot are called the altruistic desires, the lower Sefirot – egoistic. The former bestow, the latter receive. Each level may actively work only with its upper part, i.e., the GE . If before TB all levels were one under the other, after TB all AHP’s of the upper levels are inside the GE of the lower ones, which allowed"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 327 an exchange of information in both directions. This entire structure is called a “Sulam” (ladder); the souls descend and ascend it. There are two entities: the Creator and the Creation. The Creator is an entirely altruistic desire, whereas the Creation is an absolutely ego- istic desire. The Creator’s goal is to make the Creation similar to Himself, so that by the end of its correction, it will achieve absolute perfection. This can be done only by way of passing the Creator’s properties to Malchut , i.e., by mixing the nine upper altruistic Sefirot with the egoistic Malchut . However, they are completely opposite to one another. To bring them closer, a special force is created in the system of the worlds. With its help, the egoistic properties of Malchut can mix with the sparks of altruistic properties by a stroke contact between them. Now we begin to study the formation of these forces (external as regards the souls) in the worlds, so that with their help the souls could be elevated to the Creator’s level. We have learned that there are four phases of development of the light: Hochma, Bina, ZA and Malchut. Being completely filled with the light, Malchut expels it and makes TA , which leaves it absolutely empty. Then Malchut invents a system that allows it to begin receiving a little light, but for the sake of the Creator. Bina is an interim stage between Malchut and Keter . It consists of two parts: Gar (Gimel Rishonot) and Zat (Zain Tachtonot). Bina does not want to receive anything in the first three parts, but agrees to receive in the seven lower parts on condition that the reception be for someone else’s sake. This someone is ZA , which agrees to receive only 10 % for Malchut . Such is the property of Zat de Bina : receiving for the sake of giving to someone else. However, if a light more powerful than Bina’s screen comes, then Behina Bet starts desiring it for itself. However, TA forbids egoistic recep- tion; hence, the Zat de Bina begins to contract and assume the egoistic properties of Malchut . The further goal is to reverse this process: elimina-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 328 tion of the egoistic properties in Zat de Bina and passing the true altruis- tic properties to Malchut . This can be achieved by breaking of the vessels, which we will study later. With this, the entire system turns into such a combination of both egoistic and altruistic vessels that, as in our world, there will be no distinction between them. To change this situation, an additional portion of the Creator’s light is necessary. With its help, it will be possible to distinguish between the two kinds of desires. The entire process of correction is based on this principle. In fact, Zat de Bina is the central part of the creation. Much de- pends on it, so we will discuss it at length. During the descent of Nekudot de SAG under the Tabur , i.e., when Zat de Bina meets the more powerful desires of NHYM de Galgalta , Zat de Bina contract and assume Malchut’s properties. TA was made by Malchut to restrict itself; TB is the restriction of Bina . In other words, the Creator, as it were, takes on the egoistic properties of the creation. This is done in order that the Creator gradually passes His altru- istic properties to the creation, corrects it, and fills it with the light. To correct someone, one has to possess the same properties that will later be corrected. The spiritual ladder is built so that its last spiritual level, the AHP , enters us, partially acquiring our egoistic properties. In this way, it establishes contact with us to elevate us later on to the spiritual world. In fact, the worlds do not turn egoistic (they are still completely altruistic), but they are covered with an external curtain of coarseness, which enables them to be in contact with the souls of our world. Alterna- tively, rather, the worlds are the curtains that the Creator puts on, which weakens His light to the extent of becoming similar to the “spoiled” cre- ated beings, for the purpose of keeping contact with them. Therefore, on all levels in the spiritual worlds, there is the same measure of imperfection that is present in the created beings. The TB is a restriction in the worlds."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 329 Then the soul of Adam HaRishon emerges and goes through the process of splitting and descending to the point of this world. The de- scending levels of the worlds and the ascending steps of the soul are identical. So, when the soul finds itself in our world, the whole ladder of worlds is prepared for its consecutive ascent. The properties of the entire creation are installed in four phases of the development of the Direct Light. Later on, they will affect Malchut in the worlds. The worlds represent Malchut , which affects the first nine Sefirot . The soul is Malchut , the tenth Sefira that acquired the properties of the first nine. They gradually contract, coarsen, “get spoiled” and turn into the egoistic desire of Malchut . This state is called the worlds. The worlds are the Creator’s properties that gradually descend, coarsen, and contract in order to become similar to the properties of Malchut . Each world includes the properties of the others. The first nine Sefirot gradually acquire the properties of Malchut to affect later on its egoistic desires, correcting and elevating them to the highest level. ת \" הה את בחזרה המוריד , להמדרגה ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" דע חדש האור בביאת שגם , נמשך ומכאן ( צג , שלה פ \" האח את אליה המדרגה מחזרת אז אשר , דנקודים הגדלות לעת דהיינו , לפה למקומה שהיתה , התחתונה המדרגה גם אשר , אז נבחן , דאורות ס \" והע דכלים ס \" הע לה ונשלמים העדר אין \" : הכלל זה כי . לעליונה ביחד עמהם היא גם עולה , דעליונה פ \" אח על דבוקה זה נפרדים אינם כן , הקטנות בעת דעליון פ \" באח דבוקה היתה שהתחתונה וכמו .\" ברוחני התחתונה שמדרגה , ונמצא . למדרגתם שבים דעליונה פ \" שהאח בעת דהיינו , הגדלות בעת מזה . כמוהו נעשה לעליון העולה התחתון כי . ממש עליונה מדרגה לבחינת עתה נעשתה 93) From this, it follows that, when the new light AB-SAG comes to a certain level, it lowers Malchut to its previous place in the Peh de Rosh and leads the world of Nikudim to the state of Gadlut. With this, the AHP return to its level, complementing it to ten Sefirot- vessels and Sefirot-lights. The GE, of the lower level, rises together with the ascending AHP. This is because nothing disappears in the spiritual world. If the lower level were connected with the AHP of the upper level in Katnut, it would also remain attached to it during"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 330 Gadlut. In other words, during the rise of the AHP, the lower level acquires the properties of the upper. When the light AB-SAG enters the vessel, it imparts its altruistic qualities to it, so the vessel can use its AHP . Furthermore, the GE of the lower level ( Abba ve Ima lower level ( A bba v e Ima lower level ( with AHP de Keter inside) is corrected. Now there are the GE de Keter , the AHP de Keter , and the GE de Abba ve Ima on the level of Keter . We are in our world now. There is a special spiritual point inside us ( “Nekuda she ba Lev” ), which has no screen so far; hence, it is totally egoistic. Inside our egoistic vessel, there is the AHP of the lowest spiritual AHP of the lo w es t spiritual AHP level (the world of Assiya ). If the Ohr AB-SAG comes, the world of Assiya will elevate its AHP and together with it our spiritual vessel. This means that man will cross the barrier and enter the spiritual world, i.e., he will not just rise from one spiritual level to another, but will make a quantum leap from the material world to the spiritual. This opportunity - to pass from one level to a higher one up to the highest with the help of the Ohr AB-SAG - was created by a TB that divided each level into two parts, and lowered the AHP of the upper level into the GE of the lower. We see that now in Keter there are the Keter ther e ar e the Keter GE de Keter , the AHP de Keter , and the GE de Abba ve Ima of the lower level. Yet that is not all. The GE de Abba ve Ima can receive its AHP (necessary to form its own 10 AHP (necessar y t o f orm its o wn 1 0 AHP Sefirot ) from the AHP de Keter , since its power is much greater than the GE de Abba ve Ima need. Thus, Abba ve Ima start using the egoistic desires and enter Gad- lut . However, these are not their own desires; hence, such a state is called the 1 st Gadlut , as distinct from the 2 nd Gadlut , where Abba ve Ima begin using their own AHP . As the lower Partzuf enters the 1 st Gadlut , it somewhat learns to use the desires from the upper one, imitates it. This is a transition between the state of Katnut and the real Gadlut . (For details see § 134)"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 331 אל בחזרה עינים מנקבי ת \" הה והורידו , ג \" ס ב \" דע חדש האור קבלו א \" שאו בעת , ונמצא ( צד בעת אלו פ \" האח המלבישים , ת \" הז גם הנה , שלהם פ \" האח את אליהם והעלו , שלהם הפה והנה . א \" או עם אחת למדרגה ת \" הז ונעשו . א \" לאו ביחד עמהם הם גם עתה עלו , קטנות נמצאים , א \" או עם אחת מדרגה ובהיותם .\" ן \" מ עלית \" בשם נקרא א \" לאו ת \" הז של הזו עליה . א \" דאו אורותיהם גם מקבלים 94) When Abba ve Ima receive the light AB-SAG, their Malchut naturally descends to the Peh de Rosh and their AHP rise from the lower level of the ZON, taking with it the GE de ZON to the level of Abba ve Ima, constituting a single whole with it and allowing it to receive the light of this level. The ascent of the ZON to Abba ve Ima is called raising MAN. Generally speaking, the GE of the lower Partzuf is called Partzuf i s c a l l e d Partzuf MAN , and the AHP of the upper AHP o f t h e u p p e r AHP Partzuf is called in this case “the Partzuf i s c a l l e d i n t h i s c a s e “ t h e Partzuf Kli raising MAN ”. עם בפנים פנים אותה מחזיר הבינה אל א \" הז שעלית מטעם הוא , ן \" מ בשם שנקרא ומה ( צה למדרגת א \" דאו פ \" האח עם נתעלו ת \" שהז בעת כ \" וע . ן \" זו הם ת \" ז שכל ונודע .( פ אות ) החכמה הארת ומשפעת , פ \" פב א \" דאו החכמה עם חוזרת והיא . א \" דאו ס \" דע הבינה אל ן \" מ נעשו , א \" או . אליהם שעלו דנקודים ת \" הז שהם , ן \" הזו אל חכמה 95) The ascent of ZON to Bina, i.e., the raising MAN, places Bina face-to-face with Hochma. As we know, each Zat (seven lower Se- firot) is a ZON; therefore, when Zat rose together with the AHP de Abba ve Ima to the level of Abba ve Ima, they turned to MAN as regards the 10 Sefirot de AVI. Then Bina returns to a face-to-face state with Hochma de AVI and passes the luminescence of the Ohr Hochma to ZON (Zat de Nikudim). The NHYM de Galgalta is a criterion according to which we can see how much is corrected and how much is left to correct until the Gmar Tikkun . As with any other Partzuf, the light passing to the lower Partzuf fills the NHYM de Galgalta . All the upper Partzufim transfer the light to the lower. There is no other way for the light to get through. It descends from the World of Infinity and has to go through the Partzufim AB, SAG and so on, until it reaches the lowest one. The upper worlds are filled with the light that passes through them to the lower worlds."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 332 How does the light pass from one Partzuf to the next, from Partzuf t o t h e n e x t , f r o m Partzuf Malchut of the upper to Keter of the lower? Keter o f t h e l o w e r ? Keter Malchut receives all; Keter bestows all. Keter b e s t o w s a l l . Keter How is it possible? This subject is studied in Part 3 of “The Study of Ten Sefirot ”. We deal with the inverse transition of Malchut into Keter and vice Keter a n d v i c e Keter versa. There is a notion “Nitzutz Boreh and Nitzutz Nivrah” (spark of the Creator and spark of the creation). The creation is something made of nothing. The Creator’s “absence” in any place is the root of the creation. There are five vessels: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA and Malchut ; and five lights: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida . Actually, there is no such thing as “a variety of the lights”. The light depends on the sensation of the vessel, which, while receiving the amorphous light, distinguishes whatever it feels now and gives this light an appropriate name. There is no variety of the lights outside of the vessel; only one amorphous light called 'the Creator'. The lights generally divide into Ohr Hochma and Ohr Hassadim . If the vessel can only bestow and is yet unable to receive for the Creator’s sake due to the lack of the screen, the lights Nefesh, Ruach and Neshama spread in it. The lights Haya and Yechida are absent. If the vessel acquires the screen and starts receiving the light for the sake of the Creator, the lights Haya and Yechida fill it. The ZON , which rise together with the AHP to Abba ve Ima (AVI) become MAN , the request to Abba ve Ima to make a Zivug de Haka’a and pass the light of Hochma down to GE de ZON . This resembles a child’s request directed to its mother, in whom the child’s source is rooted. It turns for help to this very source. , א \" לאו ועלו לגמרי ממקומם שנעדרו הפירוש אין , שאמרנו א \" לאו ת \" הז עלית אמנם ( צו ממקומה שנעדרה הפירוש אין , ברוחניות הנאמר \" מקום שינוי \" וכל .\" ברוחני העדר אין \" כי באו כי , כאן יש תוספת רק אלא , בגשמיות מקום העתקת כדרך , החדש למקום ובאה הקודם מקום מכל , ן \" למ א \" לאו עלו ת \" שהז שהגם , באופן . הקודם במקומם נשארו וגם החדש למקום . לכן כמקודם למטה במדרגתם במקומם כ \" ג נשארו"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 333 96) However, the rise of ZON to Abba ve Ima does not mean they disappeared from their place. Nothing ever disappears in the spiritual world and a change of place does not lead to disappearance of any par- ticular object from its place as it happens in our world. Only a minor addition to the previous state is meant in spirituality: an object moves to another place while remaining where it was. The same refers to ZON, which rose to Abba ve Ima and retained their original position. , אורותיהם שם וקבלו א \" לאו ן \" למ ן \" הזו שעלו שאחר , אומרים שאנו פ \" אע , תבין ז \" עד וכן ( צז למעלה ממקומם שנעדרו הפירוש אין כאן גם הנה , למטה למקומם וחוזרים משם יוצאים הזווג נפסק היה , א \" באו למעלה ממקומם נעדרים ן \" הזו היו אם כי . שלמטה להמקום ובאו ן \" הזו וגם . שלהם השפע נפסק היה ואז . לכן כמקודם א \" אב חוזרים והיו , תיכף א \" דאו פ \" פב רק חושקת מטבעה שהבינה , למעלה נתבאר כבר כי . שלהם המוחין את אובדים היו שלמטה נמצאת כ \" וע . חכמה אור לקבל כלל ענין לה ואין ,\" הוא חסד חפץ כי \" ה \" בסו , דחסדים באור בכדי , החכמה עם פ \" פב בזווג הבינה חוזרת , ן \" למ להם ן \" הזו עלית בעת ורק . א \" אב החכמה עם כדי , תמיד שם ישארו ן \" שהזו , הוא הכרח ולפיכך .( פ אות ) א \" הז אל חכמה הארת להשפיע א \" או ממקום נעדרו ן \" שהזו לומר אפשר אי כ \" וע . פ \" פב א \" דאו הזווג אל והעמדה קיום ליתן . בלבד תוספת אלא אינו \" מקום שינוי \" שכל , שאמרנו כמו אלא . למטה למקומם שבאים בעת . למעלה כ \" ג נשארו מקום מכל , למטה למקומם ירדו ן \" שהזו שהגם , באופן 97) We should also understand that the ZON rising to Abba ve Ima, together with their AHP (raising MAN), receive the Ohr Hochma from a Zivug between Abba ve Ima, and then descend to their place. They do not disappear from the level of Abba ve Ima, since such disappearance would lead to stopping a Zivug between Abba ve Ima and a consecutive change of their position to Achor be Achor. This will prevent the spreading of the Ohr Hochma in the ZON below, because Bina by nature does not need the Ohr Hochma, only the Ohr Hassadim. It needs the light of Hochma only for passing it on to ZA in answer to its request. If the request stops, the light of Hochma ceases to descend. Only the raising of MAN de ZON to Abba ve Ima returns them to a face-to-face Zivug and resumes the passage of the Ohr Hochma to ZA. Hence, the ZON must always be above, constantly renewing their request for the Ohr Hochma."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 334 As we have already stated, any change of place in the spiritual worlds is just an addition to the previous state. Consequently, the ZON are above and below, simultaneously. The GE de ZON that is above passes the light to GE de ZON below. From this example, we see that an exchange of properties takes place. The same property can be located in a number of different places. If I write a letter to my boss asking for something, it does not mean that, upon sending the letter, I will stop having the desire for what I asked in my letter. This desire will simultaneously be in me and will pass to my boss. We are studying the transition of the world of Nikudim to the state of Gadlut . It happens that Keter , Abba ve Ima and the ZON in ZON in ZON Katnut con- sisted only of GE . Now Keter , which uses all of its ten Sefirot again, lifted the GE de Abba ve Ima up to its own level. Having received its ten Sefirot , Abba ve Ima lifted the GE de ZON . Later on, we will study how the light AB-SAG reached the Parsa and wished to get inside; but there met with enormous desires that led to breaking of the vessels. Now we encounter the notion “Sefira Da’at” for the first time. Un- til now, we said that there are only five Behinot in the Partzufim of AK: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA and Malchut . Beginning with the world of Niku- dim and further on, we come across one more Sefira called Da’at , which we include in the general number of Sefirot called HaBaD: Keter, Hochma, Bina and Da’at ( Keter is usually omitted). There was no notion of “Rais- Keter is usually omitt ed). Ther e w as no no tion of “Rais- Keter ing MAN ” in the world of AK . The Creator created the first four Behinot de Ohr Yashar: Hochma, Bina, ZA and Malchut , which emerged from Keter (the four phases of the Keter (the f our phases of the Keter vessel development). The rest is the consequence of these four phases called Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey (the Creator’s Name). Any vessel or desire, any development, takes place within these four phases. They contain all the information about the vessel and the light. Afterwards, the light fills the fourth phase, Malchut , and gives it its properties. It makes a Tzimtzum and then starts analyzing its rela-"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 335 tions with the light; it wishes to receive the light on different conditions, according to the properties installed both in Malchut and in the light. Nothing new happens, only the relations between the light and the ves- sel continue to develop. If later on you find something that is difficult to understand, you should each time go back to these four phases. The Creator’s light can enter Malchut only when Bina fills its Zat with the Ohr Hochma and passes it to ZA and on to Malchut . How does Bina receive the Ohr Hochma ? It turns to Hochma , makes a Zivug de Haka’a on this light, and then passes it to ZA . If for some reason, ZA and Mal- chut cannot or do not want to receive the light, Bina understands and refrains from passing it to them. At this moment, its seven lower Sefirot are filled only with the Ohr Hassadim . The property of Bina, to receive the Ohr Hochma , manifests only when it can pass this light on to some- one else. Bina does not need this light. We may see this picture in the world of Nikudim where the seven lower Sefirot of Bina (i.e., of the Partzuf Abba ve Ima ) are in the state of Achor be Achor; Bina does not want to receive anything. It waits until the ZON start receiving the ZON s t ar t r eceiving the ZON Ohr Hochma , which may happen only when they ( the ZON) decide to pass from Katnut to Gadlut . The Ohr AB-SAG pro- vides them with such an opportunity. For that, the ZON must turn to ZON mus t turn t o ZON Abba ve Ima , which turn face to face, make a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Ohr Hochma, and pass it to ZON . The request ZON sends to ZON sends t o ZON Ima is called Raising MAN . When Ima starts giving Ohr Hochma , the ZON descend with this request and become the receiver of ZON descend with this r eq ues t and become the r eceiv er of ZON the Ohr Hochma . However, being below and receiving the light, the ZON must be constantly close to Ima with their request to ask it to continue making a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Ohr Hochma with Abba for passing it down.

Such a state is called Holam and Katnut . The second state comes when there is Ohr Hochma in Keter and in Keter and in Keter Sefirat Abba of the world of Nikudim and Sefirat Abba faces Ima’s back. This state is called Shuruk and Yenika . In the third state, ZON raises ZON r aises ZON MAN to MAN t o MAN Sefirat Ima, which turns its face to Aba . This state is called Hirik and Gadlut. The Light AB-SAG allows the ZON to receive the ZON t o r eceiv e the ZON Ohr Hochma like AB, and to acquire the “desire to bestow” inherent in SAG . There are two kinds of Reshimot : of Katnut – Bet/Aleph and of Gad- lut – Dalet/Gimel . The first allows the world of Nikudim to enter the state of Katnut . When the second kind of Reshimo awakens, the vessel begins to ask the AB-SAG for strength to receive the Ohr Hochma . There is no pressure from above unless there is a request from below. Although the Reshimot provoke such a request, the vessel ascribes it to itself. The Light AB-SAG is the light of correction. It provides strength and desire to feel the Creator and do something for Him. The Ohr Hochma, which the vessel receives for the sake of the Creator, is a result of the correction made by the Ohr AB-SAG, and is called the light of the Purpose of Creation. For this reason, we speak about two different kinds of the light. עד ק \" א פרצופי בכל כי . הנקודים בעולם שנתחדש , הדעת ספירת סוד תבין ומכאן ( צח-צט ואנו , הדעת ספירת גם יש כבר ואילך הנקודים ומעולם . ן \" זו ב \" כח ס \" ע אם כי שם אין הנקודים עלית ענין רק אלא ק \" א בפרצופי היה לא ן \" מ עלית ענין שגם הוא והענין . ן \" זו ד \" כחב חושבים , נתבאר כי . א \" או אל ן \" דזו ן \" מ מעלית נמשך הדעת שספירת , ותדע .( ט \" ע אות ) דראש לפה המסך בכדי , למטה למקומם משם יציאתם אחר גם שם נשארים המה , ב \" לחו ן \" למ שם שעלו , ן \" שזו .\" הדעת ספירת \" נקראים , א \" באו הנשארים , האלו ן \" והזו . פ \" פב א \" דאו להזווג והעמדה קיום ליתן שמה שעלו ן \" הזו שהם . פ \" פב בזווג אותם ומעמיד המקיים , הדעת ספירת ב \" לחו עתה יש כ \" וע ס \" הע את ואילך מכאן חושבים אנו כ \" וע . למקומם ן \" הזו יציאת אחר גם שמה ונשארו , ן \" למ עלית ענין שם היה לא שעוד , הנקודים עולם שמקודם , ק \" א בפרצופי אבל . ן \" זו ד \" כחב בהשמות ' וה חסדים ' ה \" בשם תמיד מכונה הדעת שספירת , תדע גם . הדעת ספירת שם היה לא כ \" ע , ן \" מ . ג \" ה בחינת היא שם שנשארה והנוקבא , ח \" ה בחינת הוא שם הנשאר א \" הז כי .\" גבורות"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 337 98-99) We can now understand what the Sefira Da’at, which ap- peared in the world of Nikudim, is. As was stated above, such a notion was absent in the Partzufim of the world of AK. There were just the 10 Sefirot of KaHaB ZON, and the rise of the screen to Peh de Rosh; the notion “Raising MAN” still did not exist. The Sefira Da’at emerges because of the MAN de ZON rising to Abba ve Ima and its permanent staying there. From the world of Nikudim and further, we already speak about the Sefira Da’at and the Sefirot are now called the HaBaD ZON. The Sefira Da’at is also called Hey (5) Hassadim, Hey (5) Gvurot, since ZA, which remained there, is Hey (5) Hassadim, and Nukva is Hey (5) Gvurot. .\" עשר אחד ולא עשר , תשע ולא עשר הן ס \" שהע , יצירה בספר שכתוב מה על להקשות ואין ( ק ? ן \" זו ד \" כחב ספירות עשר אחד יש הרי , הדעת ספירת נתחדש הנקודים שבעולם האמור ולפי שעלו , ן \" הזו היא הדעת שספירת , נתבאר כי . ס \" הע על כלום של הוספה זה שאין , היא והתשובה , למטה שבמקומם ן \" הזו הם . א : ן \" זו בחינות ' ב שיש אלא , הוספה כאן אין כ \" וא . שם ונשארו ן \" למ ואין . ן \" מ עלית בעת שם היו שכבר מטעם , א \" באו בראש שנשארו ן \" הזו הם . ב , גוף בחינת שהם ן \" זו ב \" כח ס \" ע אלא כאן אין סוף סוף כי , ס \" הע על הוספה שום כאן שאין הרי . ברוחני העדר . ס \" הע בחינת על כלום מוסיף זה אין , א \" באו בראש ן \" הזו בחינת גם נשארו ואם . בלבד 100) We should not think that there are 9 or 11 Sefirot. Since the Sefira Da’at emerged in the world of Nikudim, it seems to comple- ment the 10 Sefirot with the 11 th . It is not so, because in reality it is the ZON, which raised MAN to Abba ve Ima and stayed there. There are two kinds of the ZON: the first are in their place below and receive the light of Hochma; the second are in Abba ve Ima above, with a constant request for this light. Therefore, they cannot be considered an addition to the 10 Sefirot. Malchut reaches the state of perfection when it receives the entire light of Hassadim from Bina and the entire light of Hochma from Hochma. First, Bina must gain strength for using its AHP for the Creator’s sake and then receive information about the ZON’s “desire to receive” the Ohr Hochma, i.e., the ZON must raise their MAN, and then Bina will pass the light of Hochma down to them."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 338 B R E A K I N G O F T H E V E S S E L S A N D T H E I R F A L L T O T H E W O R L D S O F T H E B Y A ע \" לבי ונפילתם הכלים שבירת ענין , דנקודים ת \" דז דפנים הכלים בחינת שהם , הדעת וספירת ן \" מ עלית סוד היטב ונתבאר ( קא נקודת בסוד ק \" דא ן \" הזו מן ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" דע החדש אור קבלו א \" או כי . א \" לאו ועלו שנמשכו שהיו , שלהם דאחורים הכלים את והעלו , הפה אל שלהם עינים מנקבי ת \" הה והורידו , השורק דאחורים בהכלים הדבוקים ת \" דז דפנים הכלים גם עלו כך שמתוך . דנקודים ת \" בהז נפולים . פ \" פב בבחינת א \" או והחזירו . ן \" מ בבחינת שם דנקודים ת \" הז ונעשו .( ד \" ט-צ \" פ אות ) א \" דאו על שנעשה , דהכאה הזווג כ \" ע , הפה במקום למקומה חזרה כבר , ד \" בחי שהיא , ת \" שה ומתוך , ת \" הז ונמצאים .( ד \" פ אות ) היחידה באור כתר בקומת שלמות ס \" ע הוציא , ד \" דבחי הזה המסך בבחינת רק הוא זה וכל . א \" דאו ההם הגדולים אורות קבלו הן שגם , ן \" מ בסוד שם הנכללות ממטה ס \" ע המוציא , הזווג נעשה ששם , דנקודים הראש בחינת הם א \" או כי . למעלה ממטה עם ת \" הז נמשכו ואז .( נ אות ) למטה ממעלה דהיינו , גוף לבחינת כ \" ג מתפשטים ז \" ואח . למעלה . דנקודים הגדלות פרצוף של והגוף הראש ונגמר . למטה מקומם אל א \" באו שקבלו האורות כל .( ו \" כ אות ) הנקודים גדלות דפרצוף הטעמים לבחינת נבחן זו והתפשטות 101) The Sefira Da’at is the GE de ZON of the world of Nikudim that rose to Abba ve Ima, for Abba ve Ima had received the light AB- SAG from the ZON de AK, which is called Shuruk. Then Malchut descends from Nikvey Eynaim to Peh, thus lifting the AHP de Abba ve Ima that fell to GE de ZON of the world of Nikudim. The vessels GE de Zat of the world of Nikudim rise together with them and form the Behinat MAN, which turns the Sefirot Abba ve Ima face to face (Panim be Panim). A Zivug de Haka’a on the screen in Behina Dalet led to the forma- tion of 10 complete Sefirot on the level of Keter with the light of Ye- chida. The Zat de Nikudim in Abba ve Ima (MAN, Sefirat Da’at) receive powerful light from the Rosh de Abba ve Ima, since Abba ve Ima constitute the Rosh de Nikudim, where a Zivug that lifted ten Sefirot took place. This light then spreads downwards into the Guf de ZON, and consequently into the Rosh and Guf of the world of Nikudim in the state of Gadlut. Such spreading of the light is called Ta’amim."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 339 As was mentioned, the rise of the desire from ZON to Bina is ZON t o Bina is ZON called Raising MAN . Previously, Abba ve Ima did not interact, and such a state is called Panim be Achor . There is the light of Hochma in the Partzuf Abba , but Ima does not want to receive it. MAN stimulates MAN s timulat es MAN Ima ’s need to receive Ohr Hochma from Abba ; hence, it turns its face to it. The world of the Nikudim consists of three parts: Keter and Keter and Keter Abba , where the lights is, the second part is Ima , which does not want to receive the light, and the third is the ZON . If the ZON ask ZON ask ZON Ima for the light, it will make Ima meet Abba , receive the light and pass it on to ZA . The desires that manifest in us, besides those of the animal level, are a consequence of breaking of the vessels, which caused tiny sparks of the light to enter us. A special Partzuf emerges after Partzuf emer ges af t er Partzuf TB – Katnut de Nikudim . As we al- ready said, it consists of three parts: Keter , Abba ve Ima and the ZON . TB restricts the vessels of reception and allows working only with the vessels of bestowal. Hence, there is only the Galgalta in Rosh de Keter , while the AHP is inside the AHP is inside the AHP GE de Abba ve Ima . The AHP de Abba ve Ima is in the GE de ZON . AHP de ZON is under the AHP de ZON is under the AHP de ZON Parsa , having desires to receive for itself, and cannot be worked with. None of the AHP ’s has either light or screen. All of them (except the AHP de ZON , which do not receive the light at all) receive just a small luminescence from GE . Then the aroused Reshimot Dalet/Gimel ask to do something for the AHP . Why does this desire appear? A TB was made on the Aviut Bet. The Partzuf Nikudim emerged because of a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug Aviut Aleph . Now this Partzuf decides to try to work with the Partzuf decides t o tr y t o w or k with the Partzuf AHP . Afterwards, the Partzufim AB and SAG make a Zivug , pass the light down to Keter , enabling it to enter the state of Gadlut, i.e., to lift its AHP from the AHP fr om the AHP GE de Abba ve Ima . For this purpose, Malchut in the Rosh de Keter descends from Rosh de Keter descends fr om Rosh de Keter Nikvey Eynaim to the Peh and makes a Zivug on ten complete Zivug on t en com ple t e Zivug Sefirot . Being dressed on the AHP de Keter , Abba rises (achieves Gadlut ) together with it. Now there is Ohr Hochma both in the ten Sefirot de Keter"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 340 and in Abba , so it turns its face to Ima. However, Ima wants only Has- sadim and not Hochma , so it is still with its back to Abba . How can it be compelled to receive the Ohr Hochma ? It can be done only if the ZON ask for it. To this end, the “desire to receive” the Ohr Hochma must be aroused in the ZON . The ZON de Nikudim dress onto NHYM de Galgalta of the world of AK , then pass the Ohr Hochma to the ZON. The ZON turn with their ZON turn with their ZON request to Ima, Ima then turns face to face with Abba . Thus, the light de- scends; but when it reaches the Parsa and wishes to get under it, the light encounters the enormous egoistic “desire to receive”, which, in defiance of TB , received a portion of the light. The light instantly disappears, and the vessels of GE de ZON and the GE de ZON and the GE de ZON AHP de ZON break and mix with ZON br eak and mix with ZON one another. This isso that each fragment might have a little of the Ohr Hochma . All of them fall to the lowest level under the Parsa , moving as far from the Creator as possible. This led to the presence of tiny sparks of the light in all the egoistic desires of Malchut . On the other hand, their egoism is sufficiently formed, since it has already received the Ohr Hochma . The “desire to receive” the Ohr Hochma and egoism were not yet developed in the World of Infinity. The egoistic vessels of the AHP were AHP w er e AHP first created in Nekudot de SAG . From the world of Nikudim, such vessels are called Klipot, Tuma . The light's properties are absolutely opposite to these vessels, but the “desire to receive” is so huge that it craves even for a spark of the light, which it retains, but is unable to enjoy. Hence, dur- ing all our life, we chase after any expression of the light that dresses in the various attires of this world. It seems sometimes that we are about to touch this spark of the light, but it instantly disappears. Then we rush after another expression of that spark. Thus, the sparks of light are a moving force of our egoism; they pull man forward, give him an aspiration to conquer the entire world. However, there are"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 341 sparks that, when taking root in our hearts, endow us with the aspiration to spirituality. The Gadlut of the world of Nikudim depends only on the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel. They start up this entire system, which ultimately leads to breaking of the vessels. After this breaking, Malchut on its lowest level is called Adam, and we are its parts. The place of the creation (i.e., this or that part of Malchut of the World of Infinity) is determined only by the strength of the screen. There is no screen under the Parsa , so all egoistic desires are concen- trated there. Depending on their closeness to the Creator (i.e., on the measure of their egoism), they have their places in the worlds of BYA . Everything interacts to the extent of the similarity between the vessel and the light. It is determined by the screen, which serves as a link between the light and the vessel, when the creation crosses the barrier between the material world and the spiritual. כל כי .( ז \" מ אות ) אותיות תגין נקודות טעמים : הבחינות ' ד נבחנים נקודים בפרצוף גם כי ( קב על ענינים נתוספים בתחתון אלא . בתחתונים גם שיהיו הוא הכרח , בעליונים שישנם הכחות .\" טעמים \" בשם נקראת פרצוף כל התפשטות שעיקר , שם ונתבאר . העליון בדרך המסך מזדכך הזה הביטוש י \" שע , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש בו נעשה התפשטותו ואחר מזדווג העליון אור נמצא , פוסק אינו העליון שאור ומתוך . דראש לפה שמשתוה עד , המדרגה קומת עליו יוצא , ג \" לבחי ד \" מבחי כשמזדכך , דהיינו . זיכוכו שבדרך עביות של מצב בכל במסך . א \" ז קומת עליו יוצא ,' א לבחינה וכשבא . בינה קומת עליו יוצא , ב \" לבחי וכשבא . חכמה בעת המסך על שיוצאים , הקומות אלו וכל . מלכות קומת עליו יוצא , שורש לבחינת וכשבא .\" נקודות \" בשם נקראים , הזדככותו הנשארים , והכלים .\" תגין \" בשם נקראים הסתלקותם אחר מהאורות הנשארים , והרשימות מהעביות כולו מזדכך שהמסך ואחר .\" אותיות \" בשם נקראים מהם האורות הסתלקות אחר . שני פרצוף שם עליו ויוצא . שם אשר בזווג דראש דפה במסך נכלל נמצא , דגוף 102) The four stages, Ta’amim, Nekudot, Tagin and Otiot, are also present in the world of Nikudim, since the forces that act on the high- er levels must have their reflections below, but with the additional information about the higher forces. The spreading of each Partzuf downwards is called Ta’amim."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 342 Then, because of Bitush of the Ohr Makif and the Ohr Pnimi, the screen loses its Aviut and gradually rises to the Peh de Rosh, where it finally merges with the screen positioned there. However, since the Upper Light never stops spreading, a Zivug between the light and the screen occurs at each stage of its weakening. The level of Hochma emerges when the Aviut Dalet passes to Gimel; the transition to Aviut Bet gives birth to Bina, ZA emerges on the Aviut Aleph and Malchut – on Aviut Shoresh. All the levels emerg- ing during Zivugim, together with the weakening screen, are called Nekudot. The Reshimot remaining after the light exits are called Tagin. The vessels left without the light are called Otiot. In other words, Otiot are the Reshimot that remain on the level of the Nekudot. When the Masach de Guf finally rids itself of all its Aviut and joins the Masach de Rosh in the Peh with the help of a Zivug, the Partzuf emerges. Moving away from the light is considered a positive factor in the development of the vessels. When man feels disappointed, spiritually depressed, he should understand that the genuine vessels are being de- veloped in him, the desire to receive the spiritual light. It is first decided how much light man can accept for the Creator’s sake; only then can he actually receive. The decision is made in the Rosh , where the quality and quantity of the light is calculated in advance. It may then be received in the Toch . The part of the vessel devoid of the light is called the Sof . Sof . Sof Mal- chut of the World of Infinity did not have the Rosh ; it calculated nothing, receiving everything into the Toch . The Galgalta, AB, and SAG could not fill the Sof with the light. Sof with the light. Sof Only Nekudot de SAG could get there and fill Malchut , although not with the Ohr Hochma , but with the Ohr Hassadim . Of course, Malchut wants the Ohr Hochma for its own delight, but the Ohr Hassadim also gives it enormous pleasure from giving."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 343 Spiritual advancement is possible only under the light’s influence. If the vessel is filled with the light, it has enough strength to act against its own nature; the light is more powerful than the vessel. At that, the vessel makes a Tzimtzum on the reception of pleasure and acquires some opportunity to receive for the sake of the Creator. The Galgalta , AB, and SAG are the first three actions that Malchut performs for the Creator’s sake. The fourth action prevents it from re- ceiving the light for the Creator’s sake, due to the small Aviut Bet . Now it can only bestow, so, when it still tries to receive something, the enor- mous egoistic desires emerge, and since Malchut is unable to work with them, TB is made. The next reception of the light is Katnut of the world of Nikudim ; in this state, the vessel can only give for the sake of bestowal. Because of this, the Ohr Hassadim enters it. Then the great reinforcement comes to this Partzuf in the form Partzuf in the f orm Partzuf of the light AB-SAG . The Partzuf AB can receive an enormous amount of the Ohr Hochma ; the Partzuf SAG can receive only the Ohr Hassadim . These two Partzufim seem to be opposite to one another, but they are opposite only in their actions, while their intentions are the same – to bestow. That is why they can give the Partzuf maximum power. In this Partzuf maximum po w er . In this Partzuf particular case, both lights descend upon the small Partzuf that works Partzuf that w or ks Partzuf only with its altruistic desires. The Katnut de Nikudim does not use any pleasure for its own sake. The light AB-SAG reveals the Creator’s greatness in the Nikudim . It shows the importance of merging with Him, without tempting it with pleasures. Because of this, the Partzuf has powers to receive for the sake Partzuf has po w er s t o r eceiv e f or the sak e Partzuf of the Creator, to acquire the screen and pass on to Gadlut in the Partzu- fim Keter and fim Keter and fim Keter Abba ve Ima . The AHP de ZON also try to enter AHP de ZON also tr y t o ent er AHP de ZON Gadlut , but they cannot receive the light; therefore, the vessels break. They tasted the pleasures of Gadlut , and after breaking of the vessels, they retain the Reshimot , which speak only about the egoistic pleasures. Thus, the fragments of the broken vessels fall into the Klipot . The place where the Klipot are found is called the Mador (area) Mador (ar ea) Mador Klipot ."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 344 We have learned that Malchut rose to the level of Bina in TB and restricted the reception of the light in the Kelim of GE . Together with the acquired Kelim de AHP, Malchut is not yet a Klipah at this stage, since it restricts its egoistic reception of the light. Now, during the breaking of the vessels, the egoistic desire of Malchut feels delight without having the appropriate screen, begins to want it for itself, and thus turns into a Klipah . However, the Klipah does not have the real light. All it has is the Reshimot (fragments of the broken screen). If the creation were not to go through the stage called Klipot , it would not have its own true desire. All previous desires, created by the Creator, constitute a single whole with Him. The genuinely created be- ings have no connection with the Creator; hence, they feel independent. Now, in order to allow the creation to achieve complete merging with the Creator, a spark of altruistic desire must be installed in it. It is ac- complished with the help of the breaking of the vessels and mixing all fragments together. The Reshimot of the Inner Light that departed after leaving the ves- sel are called “Tagin” . The Kelim- desires that remain after the light disap- pears from them are called Otiot . It is said about the world of AK that the AK that the AK Tagin are the Reshimot of Ta’amim and Otiot are the Reshimot of Nekudot . Thus, we find an additional explanation: • Ta’amim – Keter; • Nekudot – Hochma; • Tagin – Bina; • Otiot – ZON , ב \" ע : פרצופין ' ב יוצאים כאן גם כי . נקודים בפרצוף כאן גם נעשה זה דרך על ממש והנה ( קג ענין כי , הוא ההפרש וכל . אותיות , תגין , נקודות , טעמים : מהם אחד ובכל . זה תחת זה . ג \" ס דמלכות הדין כח מחמת אלא , פ \" באו מ \" דאו הביטוש מחמת כאן נעשה לא המסך הזדככות אחר בפרצוף הריקים הכלים נשארו לא זה ומטעם .( צ אות ) ההם בכלים כלול שהיה , המסיימת . ע \" לבי ונפלו ומתו נשברו אלא , ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא הפרצופין ' בג כמו , האורות הסתלקות"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 345 103) As in the world of AK, two Partzufim also emerge in the world of Nikudim: AB and SAG, one under the other, each having its own Ta’amim, Nekudot, Tagin and Otiot. The difference lies in the weakening of the Masach that happened, not as a result of the Bi- tush Ohr Makif with the screen, as in the world of AK, but because Malchut Mesayemet (Din) emerged, and, standing in the Parsa, sees to it that TB is observed. Therefore, when the light disappears, the vessels are not left empty as they were in Galgalta, AB and SAG. Instead, they break, die and fall into the worlds of BYA. בקומת שיצא , דנקודים ' א פרצוף שהוא , הנקודים בעולם שיצא , הטעמים פרצוף והנה ( קד ולמטה א \" דאו מפה ת \" הז התפשטות הוא והגוף , א \" באו יצא שהראש , וגוף בראש יצא , כתר באמת והוא .\" הדעת מלך \" נקרא ולמטה א \" דאו שמפה הזאת התפשטות והנה .( א \" ק אות ) ששרשם מתוך אלא . ן \" מ העלית אחר למקומם ונתפשטו שחזרו , דנקודים ת \" הז כל כללות המזווג ,\" הדעת מוח \" בשם שם שנקרא ,( ח \" צ אות ) א \" דאו פ \" לפב והעמדה לקיום א \" באו נשאר מלך \" דהיינו , הזה בשם כ \" ג נקרא גוף לבחינת למטה ממעלה התפשטותם גם לפיכך , א \" לאו . דנקודים ' הא מלך והוא .\" הדעת 104) The first Partzuf, Ta’amim of the world of Nikudim, emerged on the level of Keter, its root being in Abba ve Ima, while the Guf spreads downwards. Such a Partzuf is called Melech HaDa’at; it contains everything found in Zat de Nikudim, i.e., it includes all their vessels. Unlike the upper Partzufim AB and SAG, the lower Partzufim are called the Melachim . Abba ve Ima makes a Zivug de Haka’a on the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel and send powerful light downwards. The state of Abba ve Ima interacting is called Da’at , since a Zivug is made on the Zivug is made on the Zivug Ohr Hochma . The Partzuf that descends from them is called Partzuf that descends fr om them is called Partzuf Melech HaDa’at . These Partzufim are called the Melachim because they originate in Malchut . Then this Partzuf breaks and leaves fractured vessels that merge with the Partzuf br eaks and lea v es fr actur ed v essels that mer ge with the Partzuf AHP and fall down. AHP and f all do wn. AHP The actions that take place in the world of Nikudim are similar to those happening in AK . First, a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimo Dalet/Gimel is made, where the Partzuf Melech HaDa’at emerges in correspondence to"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 346 AB . Then the Partzuf loses the Partzuf loses the Partzuf Aviut Gimel , and Zivugim on the Reshimot Gimel/Bet (as in SAG ), Bet/Aleph, and Aleph/Shoresh take place. The desire created by the Creator cannot be changed; we can just try to change our intention. Everything boils down to the screen and the intention (for the sake of bestowal or for the sake of reception). We can either increase or decrease them depending on the conditions. If I have desires for all five dishes placed before me, and there are no restrictions to hold me back, I will naturally gobble them down; my desires match the available delight. Such was the situation in Malchut of Malchut o f Malchut the world of Infinity, where it wanted to enjoy everything the Creator had given it. This is not defined as the Klipah , since there was no restriction from the Creator’s direction. However, having filled Malchut , the light gave it such power that now it can resist the pressure of delight. It does not want to receive it for its own sake, although the desire remains. Furthermore, Malchut not only refuses to receive for itself, but also acquires additional Malchut n o t o n l y r e f u s e s t o r e c e i v e f o r i t s e l f , b u t a l s o a c q u i r e s a d d i t i o n a l Malchut powers to receive a part of the light for the sake of the Creator. The Tzimtzum Bet states that there is no more strength to receive for the Creator’s sake. Now it is only possible to sit at the table without touching anything. Having the properties similar to those of the Creator secures a right to be in the spiritual world. However, such a state is unde- sirable to both the Creator and the creation. Hence, Abba ve Ima make a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Ohr Hochma to pass it down, failing to take into account the fact that the light AB-SAG cannot descend under the Parsa and correct the vessels there. The intentions in the Rosh were good, but impossible to implement. The same happens to us: we suddenly embark on doing something with good intentions, but then forget about them and fall into egoistic desires, turning into their slaves. This occurs because the very first sensa- tion of pleasure completely seizes our desires and there is no power to resist them. As a result, all the vessel’s desires under the Parsa break, lose their screen, and pass to the Mador Klipo t. Man is sitting at the table, sees"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 347 all the dishes, and is craving to swallow them in one gulp. He is driven by his egoistic desires and pays no attention to the host. There is a fundamental difference between the desires of Malchut after TA , when it restricted its egoistic desires and refused to receive anything (although it saw all pleasures before it). In addition, Malchut, after the breaking of the vessels, just wishes to receive pleasure in any way possible, using the giver, but fails. Later, we will study how the Klipot influence man in such a way that, during all his life, he chases them, but is never able to receive ultimate pleasure. No egoistic desires are the true created beings, since the Creator made them. The only genuine creation is that in which its own desire for spirituality arises. It is the aspiration for the Creator, longing to re- ceive for His sake. Such a desire is absent in Him; it derives from the lowest black point of the creation as a result of the light’s constant influ- ence upon the vessel, like the constant dropping of water wears away the stone. This desire is called a soul; it marks man’s birth out of an animal. Then, as the creation receives larger and larger portions of the light, the soul gradually reveals the Creator and finally merges with Him. We have said that the two Partzufim, AB and SAG, emerged under the Tabur in the world of Tabur in the w orld of Tabur Nikudim . As we know, the world of Nikudim under the Tabur is in the state of Tabur is in the s t at e of Tabur Katnut on the Reshimot Bet/Aleph . Then it enters the state of Gadlut on the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel . This is the first Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Nikudim that is similar to AB de AK , which also emerged above the Tabur on the Tabur on the Tabur Reshimot Dalet/Gimel . Next, the screen loses strength, not because of the Bitush Pnim u Makif as in Makif a s i n Makif AK , but because of the breaking. Then another Partzuf (similar Partzuf ( s i m i l a r Partzuf to SAG de AK ) emerges under the SAG de AK ) e m e r g e s u n d e r t h e SAG de AK Tabur on this Tabur o n t h i s Tabur Reshimo . However, both of these Partzufim are called Melachim , since the Malchut that rose to Bina rules over them. Both AB and SAG of the world of Nikudim include four inner Partzufim : one from Ta’amim and three from Nekudot , i.e., 8 Mela- chim, all in all. The intermediate Partzufim that emerge on Aviut Shoresh are not taken into account, since they do not spread into the Guf . Guf . Guf"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 348 The first Partzuf is called Partzuf is called Partzuf Melech HaDa’at . As its screen weakens, it begins to include three more: Melech Hesed , Melech Gevura, and Melech Shlish Elion de Tifferet . The second Partzuf is called the Partzuf is called the Partzuf Shnei Shlish Tachton de Tifferet, Melech Netzah ve Hod, Melech Yesod, and Melech Malchut . The Partzufim of the world of Nikudim are called by the names of the Sefirot de Guf , because they emerge in the de Guf , because the y emer ge in the de Guf Guf of Guf of Guf Partzuf Nikudim . All of these eight Melachim are various measures of the light received under the Parsa for the Creator’s sake. However, the screens with anti-egoistic power dis- appeared; the light left them, so they are considered fallen below all spiritual desires. Why is the number of Aviut levels in the Partzuf determined dif- Partzuf de t ermined dif- Partzuf ferently in various places? The language of the ten Sefirot is very laconic. Using it for the explanation of certain phenomena in a certain aspect, Kabbalists often apply the same terms and definitions for the description of different interrelations. Thus, examining the Partzuf AB , we say that it consists of five inner Partzufim . In general, five levels of Aviut may be distinguished in any spiritual object, since it is a part of Malchut of the World of Infinity. However, when we look upon AB in relation to Gal- galta , we say that it has only four levels of Aviut , because the Aviut Dalet is absent in it. Thus, the description of spiritual objects depends on the aspect in which they are examined. Similarly, when describing a person, we may say he is a whole head shorter than another man, but it does not at all mean he has no head. All that is described in this book happens in man’s soul. Therefore, in order to understand the material, one does not have to possess abstract thinking or the ability to look at an object from different angles. This requires finding all the described phenomena and processes in one’s rela- tions with the Creator. Then comprehension will come and everything will take its place. However, if man imagines the spiritual worlds as some- thing existing outside him, as some abstract system beyond his own feel- ings, then eventually he will reach a deadlock. In such a case, he will find"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 349 it a lot more difficult to study Kabbalah, since he will have to give up his abstract ideas. If this material seems tangled to you, try to combine it with reading other books of this series, e.g. Book 4 (“Attaining the Worlds Be- yond”). Make an effort to feel that they speak about the same subjects. What is the Midat haDin (category of judgment)? Din is the only restriction, ban or the only “desire to receive” for its own sake. Malchut assumed this restriction already during TA , when it refused to receive for its own sake and remained empty. Prior to that, it could easily receive pleasure for itself. After TA, anyone who violates this law is considered a sinner, a Klipah , an impure force etc. The “desire to receive” in its four phases is the only creation. If someone decides to change his nature and acquire altruistic desires, it will be his personal affair. However, since man is unable to accomplish such transformation on his own, he will have to ask the Creator for help. Still, the desire for pleasure remains; only the intention for the use of this desire changes. Malchut is called the Midat haDin . It demands filling. If this desire has no anti-egoistic screen, it remains egoistic. However, if Malchut re- ceives power from above and acquires the screen, its intentions become altruistic. The Midat haDin disappears and the Midat haRachamim (the light of the Hassadim , the Reflected Light, the screen) takes its place. למטה ממעלה בהתפשטות כ \" ג מתגלה , דראש ס \" שבע והאיכות הכמות שכל , ונודע ( קה למקום עינים נקבי ממקום המזדווגת מלכות וירדה חזרה דראש שבאורות כמו , ולפיכך . לגוף , פ \" האח שהם , דאחורים הכלים את להם וחיברו חזרו , דפנים הכלים שהם , ע \" ונ ע \" וגו , הפה לכלים גם האורות נמשכו , לגוף למטה ממעלה בהתפשטותם כן , בהם נתפשטו והאורות . דאצילות מפרסא למטה ע \" שבבי מ \" התנהי שהם , שלהם דאחורים בפגישת תיכף כ \" ע , ההם בכלים מעורב דאצילות שבפרסא המסיימת מלכות שכח לפי אמנם הדעת דמלך הכלים וכל . לשורשם ועלו מהכלים לגמרי נסתלקו , הזה בכח הדעת דמלך האורות הסתלקות כמו הוא מהכלים האורות הסתלקות כי . ע \" לבי ונפלו , ומתו , ואחור פנים נשברו האלו שהכלים מאחר , ד \" דבחי מהעביות המסך נזדכך ואז .\" מיתה \" הנקרא , הגשמי מגוף החיות . ג \" דבחי עביות רק בו ונשאר . ומתו נשברו כבר"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 350 105) You should know that whatever is present in the ten Sefirot de Rosh is also found in the Guf in the same quantity and quality. Thus, as in the Rosh, Malchut descended from Nikvey Eynaim to the Peh, its GE joined their AHP and the light spread there. The light reached the Kelim de Achoraim, i.e., Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut under the Parsa. However, since the power of Malchut in the Parsa affects these ves- sels, the light Melech haDa’at disappears from them and rises to its root, while all the vessels of both the Panim and the Achoraim of Melech haDa’at break, die and fall into the BYA. This is because the disappearance of the light from the vessel is similar to life leaving a biological body and is therefore called death. Upon the downfall and death of the vessels, the screen loses the Aviut Dalet, so the Aviut Gimel remains. When we speak about Aviut Gimel , we should bear in mind that the matter concerns the first Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Nikudim that reached Hitlabshut Dalet and Aviut Gimel . Nevertheless, there are inner Partzufim with Aviut Dalet, Gimel, Bet, Aleph, and Shoresh inside the Partzuf with Partzuf with Partzuf Avi- ut Gimel . Now only the first inner Partzuf with Partzuf with Partzuf Aviut Dalet disappeared, leaving Aviut Gimel . The light cannot spread in desires that have no in- tention to be filled, so they remain empty and do not break. ההיא העביות נתבטלה כן , השבירה מחמת דגוף מהמסך ד \" דבחי העביות שנתבטלה וכמו ( קו אלא . הוא אחד דבר דגוף ועביות דראש העביות כי . א \" באו ראש של המזדווגת בהמלכות גם .( נ אות ) פועל וזה כח שזה שהשלימו , פ \" האח שהם , דאחורים והכלים . א \" באו בראש גם כתר דקומת הזווג נפסק ולכן האחורים ביטול \" מכונה וזה . ת \" להז דהיינו , שמתחתיה למדרגה ונפלו חזרו , כתר לקומת . נסתלקה , וגוף ראש , דנקודים הטעמים קומת שכל , ונמצא .\" א \" מאו כתר דקומת 106) As Aviut Dalet disappeared (as a result of the breaking of the vessels) from the Masach de Guf, so does Aviut Dalet in Malchut. Malchut makes a Zivug in the Rosh de Abba ve Ima, since Aviut de Rosh and Aviut de Guf are identical, although the first Zivug (in"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 351 the Rosh) is only potential, while the second one (in the Guf) really happens. For this reason, a Zivug on the level of Keter disappears also in the Rosh. The AHP, which complemented Keter, returned to the previous lower level, that is to say, to the seven lower Sefirot. This is called the elimination of the AHP de Keter in the Partzuf Abba ve Ima. Thus, the entire level of the Ta’amim de Nikudim (both the Rosh and the Guf) disappears. Abba ve Ima makes a Zivug only to fill Zivug o n l y t o f i l l Zivug ZON with their light. The ZON w i t h t h e i r l i g h t . T h e ZON moment ZON become unable to receive the light and their request to ZON b e c o m e u n a b l e t o r e c e i v e t h e l i g h t a n d t h e i r r e q u e s t t o ZON Ima stops, Ima instantly terminates its Zivug with Zivug w i t h Zivug Abba . In this case, we see that the Guf sends a command to the Guf s e n d s a c o m m a n d t o t h e Guf Rosh , which immediately stops a Zivug . First, the world of Nikudim was in Katnut , then, upon raising MAN , the AHP rose to their AHP r ose t o their AHP GE , but the breaking of the vessels followed. These vessels will continue to split into more and more desires until all the desires of ZON de Nikudim are totally broken. These are Dalet, Gimel, Bet, Aleph and Shoresh of level Gimel. Then the same happens with level Bet, Aleph and Shoresh, down to the very last desire. All this was necessary for the mixing of altruistic and egoistic properties. The breaking of the ves- sels has far-reaching and positive consequences. Only the very first level – the Shoresh – is called the Creator’s inten- tion as regards the future creation. The other levels constitute develop- ment, realization of the intention and its transformation into the Cre- ation. The first Creation is called Dalet de Dalet (Malchut de Malchut) of the World of Infinity. Everything could have stopped at this point, but, under the influence of the light, the first Creation wished to become similar to the Creator in its intentions, although its actions remained unchanged. To change the intention, one must first completely refuse to re- ceive the light, and then create an anti-egoistic force (the screen). It is"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 352 necessary for the reception of the light for the Creator’s sake. This devel- opment begins with a reception of a small portion and proceeds up to complete merging with the Creator. Such a process of the screen's devel- opment begins after TA . This is achieved by breaking the desire Dalet de Dalet into certain parts and creating the screen on all desires, from the smallest to the biggest. The screen is prepared during the descent of the worlds. To create the minimal screen, both the Creator’s and the creation’s intentions and desires must mix. Only then will sparks of altruistic desire appear in the creation, i.e., in Dalet de Dalet . This is achieved with the help of the breaking of the vessels. Nevertheless, none of these processes disappears; they constantly exist and the future connection with the Creator is conceived in them. The light does not enter the Guf during breaking of the vessels; it is in Guf during br eaking of the v essels; it is in Guf the Rosh and enters only the GE of each Sefira , although it also wants to enter the AHP (the egoistic vessels). However, in accordance with AHP (the egois tic v essels). Ho w ev er , in accor dance with AHP TA , it cannot do that. Still, a very brief contact takes place, so the vessel starts wishing to receive the light for its own sake, realizing what such reception could mean. Previously, the creation did not understand it. The matter con- cerns the development of egoism from a stage where the reception of the light is restricted, to that of a passionate “desire to receive” it no matter what. During the emergence of the worlds and Partzufim, we are dealing with the gradual formation of a more advanced, albeit coarser egoism, an egoism that understands what it means to enjoy the light, and desires it more and more. When the vessel reaches the last stage of its develop- ment (our world), it becomes most suitable for its role. When the vessel breaks, the egoistic desire (the Reshimo of the screen) is left in it, while the light that was to enter the vessel ascends. However, the connection between the Reshimo of the screen and the van- ished light still exists, giving the vessel some luminescence, some memo- ry of the screen it once had."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 353 What is the difference between the weakening of the screen due to the Bitush Pnim u Makif and that owing to the breaking of the vessels? Bitush Pnim u Makif and that o wing t o the br eaking of the v essels? Bitush Pnim u Makif In the first case, the vessel, pressed by the Ohr Makif that wants to get Ohr Makif that w ants t o ge t Ohr Makif inside, understands that it cannot receive the light in an altruistic way. Egoistic reception is forbidden, so the vessel decides to expel the light rather than violate the ban. In the second case, the vessel’s initial inten- tions seem to be good, but it suddenly discovers that it wants to receive in a purely egoistic way; therefore, TA instantly snaps into action, and the weakening of the screen is expressed here as the breaking of the ves- sel, as its death. Previously, we explained how the breaking of the vessels took place. The light AB-SAG came and began spreading in the Rosh de Keter, the Rosh de Abba ve Ima, the GE de ZON, and upon reaching the Parsa, the vessels began to break and to lose their screen.This is because the light met with the egoistic desires without the screen. Here the TA prohibi- tion worked; the light rose to the Rosh de Nikudim and then to the Rosh de SAG , while the vessels that wanted to receive pleasure for themselves broke and fell into the Klipot . There is the light of the Thought of Creation and the light of Cor- rection of Creation. The light that created Malchut and its desire to enjoy it is called the Ohr Hochma or the light of the Thought of Creation. The light that corrects Malchut, reveals the higher properties in it, and en- ables it to feel pleasure from giving is called the Ohr Hassadim . One can feel the Creator either by enjoying the contact with Him (delight from reception of the Ohr Hochma ), or by feeling His properties and enjoying similarity to Him (delight from the Ohr Hassadim ). Unless egoism begins to feel the Creator’s properties, it will nei- ther make Tzimtzum Aleph , nor ever wish to be like the Creator. The Creator created an egoism that would be able to develop and feel both the delight as well as the One who provides it. Indeed, the future ability to be like the Creator was already included in the initial phase of the development of egoism."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 354 The information that stimulates the sensation of the Giver comes to the vessels together with the light AB-SAG . This is the light of correc- tion, the light of a very different nature. It arouses in man very subtle feelings of the Giver’s significance and the desire to be like Him. The TA is an extremely cruel act of the creation that rather pushed the Creator aside, saying that it wanted nothing from Him, depriving Him of an op- portunity to be the Giver. It rendered His desires uncalled for, until it begins to understand that the Thought of Creation suggests, not refus- ing to receive the light, but reception of it for the sake of the Creator. The primary role in the creation of the Partzufim after TA belongs to the screen; action is secondary and the entire process develops from big to small. After TB , when the Partzuf restricted itself, the desire to pass Partzuf r es trict ed itself, the desir e t o pass Partzuf from Katnut to Gadlut appeared for the first time. This required strength; the strength came from the light AB-SAG . All the vessels above the Parsa: Keter, Abba ve Ima, GE de ZON, can feel an opportunity to pass to Gadlut . However, this light cannot get under the Parsa. The AHP de ZON cannot AHP de ZON canno t AHP de ZON feel it; hence, they remain in the same state. The Nekudot de SAG under the Parsa are empty after the TB . They form a place for the worlds Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira, and Assiya. When we say that there is no light, it actually means that the Kli simply cannot feel it. The light itself is amorphous; there are no distinc- tions in it; in other words, the vessel is unable to detect any shades, any variations of pleasure in the light. Such was the state of Malchut in the World of Infinity. When it felt the light’s properties, it made TA. Malchut began to distinguish nine previous Sefirot in the light, starting from the closest. As it discovered the last one (Keter) and felt the contrast between their properties ( Keter only bestows and Keter only bes t o w s and Keter Malchut only receives), it instantly made a Tzimtzum . ZA consists of Hochma and Bina . It is called “a small face”, which refers to the amount of light in it, as compared to Malchut, which wishes to be big and receive all the light of Hochma . Keter gives all, Keter giv es all, Keter Malchut"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 355 receives all, and Bina does not receive anything. These are the character- istics of the four phases of the Direct Light and their root called Keter . While studying Kabbalah, one should constantly remember that there are no such notions as place, time or space (as we understand them) in spirituality. The notion of place first appeared only after TB . The Nekudot de SAG under the Parsa remain empty after TB and form a place for the worlds of ABYA . Thus, by “place”, we usually mean the Nekudot de SAG; to be precise, the vessels working in compliance with the law of TA as regards the vessels working according to TB , which form the worlds beginning from Atzilut . Now we can understand the fundamental difference between these two modes of working with desires. The vessels of TB are not exactly the vessels of TA , which use only half of their desires. It is a cardinally different principle of work. We will be studying the so-called ascents of the worlds wherein the \"place\" may or may not ascend together with the worlds. In spirituality, we understand time as a number of necessary ac- tions aimed at achieving a certain spiritual level. These actions form a cause-and-effect chain. The less corrected man is, the more the Creator conceals Himself from him; the more man’s way to the Creator turns from a sequence of spiritual actions into an unconscious flow of time. In the spiritual world everything is connected to the intention for the sake of the Creator, hence nothing ever disappears there. Only the Klipot , the desires for one’s self can disappear. Our world is below the Klipot , therefore we observe in it such a phenomenon as disappearance. We have spoken about the breaking of the vessels. The light AB- SAG came and began to spread in the Rosh de Keter , the Rosh de Abba ve Ima , the GE de ZON, and as soon as it reached the Parsa , the vessels began to split, lose the screen, for the light came across desires to receive for one’s own sake without a screen. The TA snapped into action, the light rose to Rosh de Nikudim , and then to Rosh de SAG ; the egoistic vessels broke and fell into the Klipot ."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 356 הנשאר , ג \" דבחי העביות על ונזדווג שחזר נמצא , מלהאיר פוסק אינו העליון שאור ומתוך ( קז לספירת נתפשט , למטה שממעלה והגוף . חכמה בקומת ס \" ע ויצאו . א \" באו ראש של במסך העביות גם נתבטלה ואז . ומת ונשבר ע \" לבי נמשך הוא וגם . דנקודים ' הב מלך והוא . החסד , א \" דאו זו חכמה לקומת שהשלימו , פ \" האח , דאחורים הכלים וגם . ודראש דגוף מהמסך ג \" דבחי . כתר בקומת ל \" כנ , ת \" לז , שמתחתיה למדרגה ונפלו ונתבטלו חזרו והגוף . בינה בקומת ס \" ע ויצאו . במסך שנשאר , ב \" דבחי העביות על הזווג נעשה כ \" ואח ע \" לבי נמשך הוא וגם . דנקודים ' הג מלך והוא . הגבורה בספירת נתפשט למטה שממעלה . בראש גם בינה דקומת הזווג ונפסק . וגוף בראש ב \" דבחי העביות גם ונתבטלה . ומת ונשבר . ת \" בהז שמתחתיה למדרגה נפלו דראש בינה קומת של והאחורים שלו והגוף . א \" ז בקומת ס \" ע עליה ויצאו . בהמסך שנשאר , א \" דבחי העוביות על הזווג נעשה כ \" ואח ונזדככה . ממנו האור ונסתלק נתקיים לא הוא וגם . ת \" דת עליון בשליש נתפשט למטה ממעלה . ת \" לז , שמתחתיה למדרגה נפל א \" ז דקומת והאחורים . וראש בגוף א \" דבחי העוביות גם 107) The Upper Light never stops shining; it makes a new Zivug on the Aviut Gimel, which remained in the Masach de Rosh of Abba ve Ima. Because of this Zivug, a Partzuf consisting of 10 Sefirot emerges with the level of Hochma, while the Guf, with the level of Hesed, spreads down, and is called the second Melech of the world of Niku- dim. As with the first, the Melech haDa’at, it spreads in the BYA, breaks and dies. The Aviut Gimel disappears from the Masachim de Guf and de Rosh. The AHP, which completed the Partzuf at the level of Hochma, broke and fell to the lower level. Then a Zivug on Aviut Bet produces 10 Sefirot of the level of Bina, while the Guf spreads down to Gevura, and is called the third Me- lech of the world of Nikudim. It spreads down to BYA, breaks and dies. Aviut Bet disappears from the Guf and the Rosh and a Zivug on the level of Bina also stops in the Rosh. The AHP of Bina de Rosh fall to the lower level, into the seven lower Sefirot. The next Zivug is made on Aviut Aleph; the 10 Sefirot with the level of ZA appear, while the Guf spreads to the upper third of Tifferet. It also ceases to exist, the light leaves it, and Behina Aleph disappears from the Guf and the Rosh. The AHP de ZA falls to the lower level of Zat."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 357 Why are the Partzufim in the world of Nikudim called Melachim ? It is because they are in Gadlut (big state), which emerges from Katnut (small state) with the Ohr Nefesh, also called the Ohr Malchut . Regardless of the eight levels, only seven Melachim exist, since there are only seven lower parts, levels. Similarly, there are just seven Shorashim (roots) in the Rosh for their spreading. א \" באו נתבטלו , הדעת מלך בשבירת כי . פ \" האח שהם , לירד א \" דאו האחורים כל נגמרו וכאן ( קח השייכים פ \" אח רק א \" באו נתבטלו , החסד מלך ובשבירת . כתר לקומת השייכים פ \" אח רק ובהסתלקות . בינה לקומת השייכים פ \" האח נתבטלו , הגבורה מלך ובשבירת . חכמה לקומת . א \" ז דקומת פ \" האח נתבטלו , ת \" דת עליון שליש במסך ונשאר . דקטנות ע \" הגו רק בהם נשאר ולא , א \" דאו הגדלות בחינת כל שנתבטלה ונמצא נמצא אז אשר . דראש למסך ונשתוה , עביותו מכל דגוף המסך נזדכך כ \" ואח . דשורש עביות רק אות ) האחרונה מהבחינה חוץ שבו הרשימות שמה ומתחדשים . ראש של דהכאה בזווג נכלל . ת \" ישסו הנקראת , חדשה קומה עליו יצא הזה התחדשות ובכח .( א \" מ 108) After the last Zivug on Aviut Aleph was terminated, all the AHP de Abba ve Ima stopped descending; therefore, when the Me- lech haDa’at de Abba ve Ima broke, the AHP de Keter disappeared. When the vessels of the Melech haHesed in Abba ve Ima broke, the AHP de Hochma disappeared. When the vessels of the Melech haGevura in Abba ve Ima broke, the AHP de Bina disappeared. When the Melech Shlish Elion de Tifferet broke, the AHP de ZA disappeared. Thus, the entire level of Gadlut in Abba ve Ima ceased to exist. Only the vessels of the GE de Katnut with Aviut Shoresh in the Masach remained. Afterwards the Masach de Guf loses all its Aviut, merges with the Masach de Rosh, and joins a Zivug de Haka’a in the Rosh. All the Reshimot except for the last Behinot are renewed in it. From this renewal (Zivug), a new level arises called the YESHSUT. Let us review the whole process briefly. The world of Nikudim was in Katnut where there were only the vessels of GE in Keter , Abba ve Ima and ZON . Then Keter and Keter and Keter Abba ve Ima made a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug Dalet de Hitlab- shut and Gimel de Aviut , and the light spread to the Guf. The Guf broke Guf br ok e Guf"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 358 and only Aviut Gimel-Bet remained.

Because of this Zivug, a Partzuf of a different spiritual level emerges; hence, it is already called the Partzuf of a dif f er ent spiritual lev el emer ges; hence, it is alr eady ca lled the Partzuf YESHSUT and not YESHSUT and no t YESHSUT Abba ve Ima . בקומת ס \" ע עליו ויוצאים . ג \" בחי אם כי בו נשאר לא , נאבדה אחרונה שהבחינה ומתוך ( קט דגוף החזה במקום והלביש וירד , א \" מאו מהראש יצא , שבו דגוף עביות וכשהוכרה . חכמה והגוף .\" ת \" ישסו \" מכונה הזה והראש . דראש ס \" הע ולמעלה מחזה ומוציא .( ה \" נ אות ) דנקודים . דנקודים ' הד מלך והוא . ת \" הת סיום עד ת \" ת ש \" בב ולמטה מהחזה מוציא הוא שלו של דאחורים והכלים . וגוף ראש ג \" דבחי העביות ונזדככה . ומת ונשבר ע \" לבי נמשך הוא וגם , ב \" דבחי עביות על הזווג נעשה כ \" ואח . שלהם גוף במקום שמתחתיה למדרגה נפלו ראש . והוד נצח הכלים ' בב נתפשט למטה שממעלה שלו והגוף . בינה קומת עליו ויצא . בו הנשאר . דנקודים ' ה מלך דהיינו , אחד מלך שניהם והם דאחורים והכלים . וגוף בראש ב \" דבחי העביות גם ונזדככה . ומתו ונשברו ע \" לבי נמשכו הם וגם שנשארה , א \" דבחי עביות על הזווג נעשה כ \" ואח . לגוף , שמתחתיה להמדרגה נפלו הקומה של ' הו מלך והוא . דיסוד בכלי נתפשט למטה שממעלה שלו והגוף . א \" ז קומת עליו ויצא . בו והכלים . וגוף בראש א \" דבחי העביות גם ונזדככה . ומת ונשבר ע \" לבי נמשך הוא וגם . דנקודים דבחינת העביות על הזווג נעשה כ \" ואח . לגוף , שמתחתיהם למדרגה נפלו שבראש דאחורים . דמלכות לכלי נמשך שלו למטה והממעלה . מלכות קומת עליו ויצא . במסך הנשאר , שורש בראש דשורש העביות גם ונזדככה . ומת ונשבר ע \" לבי נמשך הוא וגם . דנקודים ' הז מלך והוא הכלים כל להתבטל נגמרו ועתה . בגוף , שמתחתיה למדרגה נפלו דראש והאחורים . וגוף . מלכים ' ז הנקראים , דנקודים ת \" ז דכל כ \" שביה וכן , ת \" דישסו דאחורים 109) After the disappearance of the last degree of Aviut (Dalet), the Behina Gimel brought forth 10 Sefirot of the level of Hochma. The Partzuf begins from the Chazeh de Abba ve Ima so that the Sefirot of its Rosh rise above the Chazeh and are called the YESHSUT; whereas below the Chazeh, including the lower two thirds of Tifferet, the 10 Sefirot de Guf are formed. This is the fourth Partzuf called the Melech of the world of Nikudim. It also spreads to BYA, breaks and dies. The Aviut de Behina Gimel disappears both in the Rosh and in the Guf. The AHP de Rosh falls to the lower level (Guf). Then a Zivug on Aviut de Behina Bet brings forth the level of Bina. The Guf of the new Partzuf spreads to the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 359 vessels Netzah and Hod. This fifth Partzuf is called the Melech of the world of Nikudim. It also spreads to BYA, breaks and dies. The Behina Bet disappears both in the Rosh and in the Guf, while the AHP de Rosh falls to the lower level (Guf). The next Zivug on Aviut Aleph produces the level of ZA, while its Guf spreads down to the vessel of Yesod. This is the sixth Melech of the world of Nikudim, which reaches the BYA, breaks, and dies. The Aviut Aleph disappears both in the Rosh and in the Guf, while the AHP de Rosh falls to the lower level (Guf). After that, the last Zivug is made on the Zivug i s m a d e o n t h e Zivug Aviut Shoresh that is left in Aviut Shoresh t h a t i s l e f t i n Aviut Shoresh the Masach . It brings forth the level of Malchut , which spreads to the vessel of Malchut . This is the seventh Melech of the world of Melech o f t h e w o r l d o f Melech Nikudim . As with all the preceding Melachim , it breaks and dies. The last Aviut de Shoresh dis- Aviut de Shoresh d i s - Aviut de Shoresh appears in both the Rosh and in the Rosh a n d i n t h e Rosh Guf, and the AHP de Rosh fall to the AHP de Rosh f a l l t o t h e AHP de Rosh lower level ( to its ( t o i t s ( Guf) . Thus, all the AHP de YESHSUT disappeared and all AHP de YESHSUT d i s a p p e a r e d a n d a l l AHP de YESHSUT the seven lower Sefirot de Nikudim (i.e., all the seven Melachim ) broke. Tifferet constitutes the entire Guf of the Guf of the Guf Partzuf . Because of Partzuf .

Four levels, one under the other, appear in Abba ve Ima: Keter is called “Histaklut Eynaim Abba ve Ima” (looking into one anoth- er’s eyes); Hochma is called “Gufa de Aba”; Bina is called “Gufa de Ima”; and ZA is called “Yesodot de Abba ve Ima”. Four bodies emerge from the above-mentioned levels: the Melech haDa’at, the Melech haYesod, the Melech Gevura and Melech of the upper third of Tifferet down to the Chazeh. The Gufim of all of these four levels broke, both Panim and Achoraim, i.e., both GE and AHP. However, in the Rashim (heads) of these four levels of Abba ve Ima, all the Kelim de Panim of each level that were during Katnut de Ni- kudim, that is to say, the GE and Nikvey Eynaim (Keter, Hochma and Gar de Bina), remained in their places. Only the Kelim de Achoraim (i.e., the AHP de Rosh, the Zat de Bina, ZA, and Mal- chut) of each level, which joined the GE during Gadlut, disappeared because of the breaking of the vessels. They fell to the lower level, i.e., to where they had been during Katnut. היא ' הא שקומה : מזה למטה זה קומות ' ד יציאת ת \" ישסו בפרצוף היה ממש ז \" ועד ( קיא וקומת , א \" ז וקומת , בינה וקומת , בזה זה ת \" דישסו עיינין הסתכלות ונקראת חכמה קומת , היסוד מלך , ה \" נו מלך , ת \" דת תתאין ש \" ב מלך : שהם , גופים ' ד נתפשטו שמהם . מלכות הקומות ' בד דהיינו , בהראשים אבל . יחד ואחור פנים נשברו שלהם הגופים ' וד . המלכות ונפלו . השבירה בסבת נתבטלו בלבד האחורים ורק , שבהם דפנים הכלים נשארו , ת \" דישסו ה \" מ קומת עוד יצא , ת \" וישסו א \" או הפרצופים ' ב אלו ביטול אחר והנה . שמתחתיהם למדרגה . בו אאריך לא , בלבד כלים תיקוני רק אלא גוף לבחינת ממנה נתפשט שלא ולפי . בנקודים 111) Similarly, four levels, one under the other, emerged in the Partz- uf YESHSUT. The first level (Hochma) is called the Histaklut Ey- naim de YESHSUT, the second level (Bina), followed by ZA and Malchut, brings forth 4 bodies: the Melech of two lower thirds of Tifferet, the Melech Netzah-Hod, the Melech Yesod and the Melech"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 361 Malchut. These four Gufim broke (both Panim and Achoraim), but the Kelim de Panim remained in the Rashim de YESHSUT. Their Achoraim disappeared because of the breaking of the vessels, and fell to the lower level. After the two Partzufim Abba ve Ima and the YESHSUT broke, one more Partzuf emerged – MA of the world of Nikudim. However, since no Guf spreads from it (only “Tikuney Kelim”), we will not characterize it here. Thus, because of a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimot Dalet/Gimel , four Mela- chim emerged in the Rosh de Abba ve Ima (Gadlut de Nikudim). Then there was a Zivug in the Zivug in the Zivug Rosh de YESHSUT on the Rosh de YESHSUT on the Rosh de YESHSUT Aviut Gimel/Bet , which led to the emergence of four more Melachim . All of them received the Ohr Hochma , but not for the Creator’s sake; hence, they lost the screen, broke and fell from their spiritual level. Each of them retained the Reshimo of the light and the Ohr Hozer – a tiny portion of the screen’s light, which Ohr Hozer – a tin y por tion of the scr een’s light, whic h Ohr Hozer they wanted to work with, but could not. This tiny portion of the light is called a “Nitzutz” (spark). The fact that it resides inside the egoistic desire makes it possible to start correct- ing the broken vessels. Had the vessels never been broken, this altruistic spark would have never gone under the Parsa , and the vessels of the AHP found there would have had no possibility for correction. This will be the task of the MA Hadash (new MA ) or the World of Correction, Atzilut , which emerged from the Rosh de AK because of a Rosh de AK because of a Rosh de AK Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Aviut de Shoresh . This level is called the Metzah (forehead). The screen in Galgalta lost its strength, the light disappeared, and the Masach de Guf rose to join the Masach de Guf r ose t o join the Masach de Guf Masach de Rosh . The Reshimot Dalet/ Gimel was left from the light of Hochma in the Toch and Dalet / Dalet / Dalet Gimel from the light of the Hassadim in the Sof . Sof . Sof Reshimot Dalet/Gimel of the light of Hassadim means that, although the Ohr Hochma is felt and desired owing to the Aviut Gimel , nevertheless, the creation just wants to merge with the Creator. That is to say, it wants to be filled with Ohr Hassadim and not with Ohr Hochma (the light of Purpose of the Creation), for it is unable to receive Ohr Hochma for the Creator’s sake. The Partzuf AB"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 362 emerges on the Reshimot de Toch and the Gadlut de Nikudim emerges on the Reshimot de Sof . After the light leaves the Reshimot de Sof . Af t er the light lea v es the Reshimot de Sof Partzuf AB, the Partzuf SAG emerges above the Tabur in the world of Tabur in the w orld of Tabur AK . As a result of a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimo Dalet/Gimel under the Tabur, Gadlut of the world of Nikudim called the lower AB or Abba ve Ima emerg- es. When it disappears, a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimo Gimel/Bet takes place under the Tabur . As a result, the second Partzuf called the lower Partzuf called the lo w er Partzuf SAG or the YESHSUT springs up. The properties of the YESHSUT springs up. The pr oper ties of the YESHSUT Partzufim both above and under the Tabur are similar in the sense that the light of Tabur ar e similar in the sense that the light of Tabur Hochma spreads in the lower AB , while the light of Hassadim with luminescence of Hochma spreads in the lower SAG . The correction of the ZON and ZON and ZON Malchut under the Tabur will consist in lifting them to the level of the Tabur will consis t in lif ting them t o the lev el of the Tabur Partzufim AB and SAG . After the disappearance of the light in the Partzufim, pure egoism remains, which remembers what it means to receive the light. All the previous Reshimot were based on the reception of the light for the sake of the Creator. Now, when the vessels of Malchut were broken, the “de- sire to receive” the light at any cost appears for the first time. However, this is not the final point of development of egoism; a very long way lies ahead of it. Malchut senses the light long before it enters it. The same happens in our world. We feel pleasure before we actually receive it. Once we get it, it instantly disappears. It only seems to us that we feel delight. Each time we have to perform certain actions that would help us feel pleasure, but the moment we come in contact with it, the vessel ceases to exist and the pleasure vanishes. However, we all live only for the sake of achieving such contact. If we were filled with constant imperishable pleasure, we would not make a single move in the direction of new delight, since we would be overfilled with the previous one. Like drug addicts, we would enjoy an injected dose, doing nothing until the need for a new dose is felt. Only egoism (if corrected) that has reached a state of absolute opposition to the Creator"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 363 may become equal to Him. Then the received pleasure will not vanish; the desire for it will remain, whereas we, not for a moment stopping to enjoy, will rush towards new reception for the sake of the Creator. The light wanted to enter the vessel under the Tabur and the vessel was eager to receive it for the Creator’s sake according to the strength of its screen. The vessel discovered too late that there was no screen. All pleasures were already inside and imposed their will on it. However, TB expelled the light and the vessel remained empty of the desires it could not satisfy. This terrible state accompanies the breaking of the vessels, death and a downfall. All desires become isolated and undirected at one goal. When man is firm of purpose, all his desires (both altruistic and egoistic) pursue the same goal. If he is not, he has many different desires that do not aim at one target. Such a person cannot succeed. When the Melachim fall, the highest of them, having lost the screen, falls lower than the rest. All the eight Melachim were of different levels. The vessel of Keter fell down to Keter f ell do wn t o Keter Malchut . The vessel of Bina (the vessel of bestowal) did not fall as low. The Sefirot de Rosh have the following names: Gar de Keter Hochma Gar de Bina Zat de Bina ZA Malchut Metzah Eynaim Nikvey Eynaim Awzen Hotem Peh"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 364 T H E W O R L D O F C O R R E C T I O N B O R N F R O M M E T Z A H O F T H E W O R L D O F A K ק \" דא מהמצח שיצא , החדש ה \" ומ התיקון עולם : ק \" דא הראשונים פרצופים ' ד כאן עד הפתיחה מתחילת היטב נתבאר והנה ( קיב שבו ס \" והע , ד \" בחי על בו נעשה דהכאה שהזווג ,\" גלגלתא פרצוף \" הנקרא , ק \" דא ' הא פרצוף . כתר בקומת הן 112) Now, let us examine all the spiritual worlds, the entire spiritual Universe as a single whole. We will see that in the Galgalta (Partzuf Keter of the entire Universe) a Zivug was made on all the five Reshi- mot – Dalet/Dalet. In fact, the screen stood in Malchut (Peh) of the common Rosh of the entire Universe (this Rosh is actually “Rosh” of Malchut of the World of Infinity). שלו ס \" והע , ג \" דבחי עביות על בו נעשה דהכאה הזווג אשר , ק \" דא ב \" ע נקרא , ק \" דא ' הב פרצוף ג \" ס נקרא ק \" דא ' הג פרצוף , הגלגלתא דפרצוף ולמטה מפה מלביש והוא . חכמה בקומת הן מלביש והוא . בינה בקומת הן שלו ס \" והע . ב \" דבחי עביות על בו נעשה דהכאה שהזווג , ק \" דא . ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ולמטה מפה Then the screen rises from Malchut to ZA (Hotem) of this Rosh. A Zivug on Reshimot Dalet/Gimel in this screen creates AB (Partzuf Hochma of the entire Universe). So now, the screen stands in ZA of the common Rosh. Then the screen continues rising. This time it ascends from ZA to Bina of the common Rosh and there a Zivug on the Reshimot Gimel/Bet creates the Partzuf SAG (Bina of the entire Universe). Afterwards, as we know, TB takes place and renders the AHP (the AHP (the AHP vessels of Zat de Bina, ZA and Malchut ) of each Sefira unfit for use. Be- cause of TB , Bina of the common Rosh happens to divide into two parts: the Gar ( Nikvey Eynaim Gar ( Nikv e y Eynaim Gar ( ) and the Zat ( Awzen Zat ( A wzen Zat ( ). Now the screen stands on the borderline between these Gar and Gar and Gar Zat , i.e., between the Nikvey Ey- naim and the Awzen .

Zivug made on the scr een positioned ther e. Zivug Then the screen continues “rising” to Hochma of the common Rosh , i.e., the Eynaim , but it should be stressed that now, after the TB , the screen stands not at the bottom of each level as before, but in the Nikvey Eynaim , that is to say, on the border between Gar de Bina and Zat de Bina . Hence, the world of the Nikudim ( ZA of the entire Universe and Partzuf MA ) emerges from a Zivug in Zivug in Zivug Nikvey Eynaim de Eynaim , i.e., the screen stands on the border between Gar and Gar and Gar Zat de Hochma of the common Rosh . This Zivug was made on the Zivug w as made on the Zivug Reshimot Bet/Aleph with the additional information of TB (ban on using the vessels of reception). So now the Partzufim , as it were, consist only of two and a half Sefirot . Then, upon breaking of the vessels, the screen moves to the Nikvey Eynaim de Keter of the common Rosh (Metzah). There a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Reshimot Aleph/ Shoresh creates the world of Atzilut, also called the world of Vrudim or MA Hadash (new MA ). We will explain later on why Atzilut is called MA Hadash . The world of Atzilut corrects the broken vessels, gives birth to the soul of Adam haR- ishon , the soul that descends to the lowest point and only then becomes the true Creation, for now it is infinitely remote from the Creator and can start correcting itself and ascend back to Him. We should have a general idea of the world of Atzilut , which con- trols everything. The creation is constantly connected with this system. As the result of a gradually achieved correction, we ascend 6000 levels and reach the world of Atzilut . Then the 7 th , 8 th , 9 th, and 10 th millennia come, accessible only to those who rise to the level of the Final Correc- tion ( the Gmar Tikkun) . הן שבו ס \" והע , א \" דבחי עביות על בו נעשה דהכאה שהזווג , ק \" דא ה \" מ נקרא ק \" דא ' הד פרצוף , וחיצוניות לפנימיות נחלק והוא . ק \" דא ג \" דס ולמטה מטבור מלביש זה ופרצוף . א \" ז בקומת"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 366 ענין נעשה וכאן .\" הנקודים עולם \" נקרא והחיצוניות , ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ נקרא שהפנימיות , הדעת וענין , ן \" מ ועלית , והגדלות , והקטנות ,' ב צמצום הנקרא , בבינה המלכות של השיתוף , ק \" דא ' הד בפרצוף נתחדשו אלו כל כי . הכלים שבירת וענין , פ \" פב ב \" החו והמזווג המכריע .\" הנקודים עולם \" או ה \" מ הנקרא The fourth Partzuf of the world of AK is called MA. It emerges from a Zivug de Behina Aleph, and its 10 Sefirot have the level of ZA. It dresses onto Galgalta from the Tabur and below, where the Nekudot de SAG spread. The Partzuf MA has an inner part called MA and BON of the world of AK, and an outer – Nikudim, which dresses onto the inner part. In this place, Malchut joins Bina, i.e., TB, Katnut, Gadlut, the raising of MAN, the emergence of Sefira Da’at. This in turn promotes a Zivug between Hochma and Bina Panim be Panim, the breaking of the vessels – all of which occurred in the fourth Partzuf MA or the world of Nikudim. The Partzuf MA, born from the SAG on the Aviut Bet/Aleph, refers to TA and is considered an inner Partzuf as regards the Partzuf as r egar ds the Partzuf MA that was born from the Nekudot de SAG, and under the Tabur, refers to the TB. We see this entire process as a cause-and-effect chain, but in fact, this is not a process; it is a constantly existing static picture. There are Ta’amim, Nekudot, Tagin and Otiot in each Partzuf . The Partzuf . The Partzuf processes that occur in Nekudot de SAG – the descent under Tabur , the mixing with NHYM de Galgalta , TB , whose Reshimo brings forth the world of Nikudim in Katnut and Gadlut , the breaking of the vessels – all this may be referred to the Nekudot de SAG and to one of the parts of the Partzuf SAG . The Gematria (numeric value) of SAG consists of Yud-Key-Vav-Key , but the filling, the light that is in the Kelim of Hochma, Bina, ZA and Mal- chut, amounts to 63. The filling of the letter Vav (Vav-Aleph-Vav) includes the letter Aleph , which points to TB and the Partzuf Nikudim . The follow- ing letter, Key, again includes Yud and not Aleph , which refers to Gadlut de Nikudim . Therefore we do not view Nikudim (when taken separately) as the world. So why do we not say that the SAG got broken? These changes"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 367 do not affect the SAG since it is under the Tabur , and all that happened refers to its outer Partzufim (so-called Partzufey Searot ), which dress onto it. The Partzufey Searot (hair) are examined in detail in Part 13 of “The Study of the Ten Sefirot” on the example of the Partzuf Arich Anpin of the world of Atzilut . The first spreading of the light down from Peh de Rosh to the Tabur on Aviut Dalet is called Ta’amim . Then next Partzufim-Nekudot emerge on Gimel de Dalet, Bet de Dalet, Aleph de Dalet and Shoresh de Dalet , al- though we do not give them names under the Tabur de AK . Under the Tabur in the world of Tabur in the w orld of Tabur Nikudim, we call them Sefira Da’at, Melech Da’at , Melech Hesed, Melech Gevura and Melech of the upper third of Tifferet . At that, the Partzuf emerging on Partzuf emer ging on Partzuf Aviut Shoresh does not spread into the Guf ; Guf ; Guf hence, it is not taken into account and is not called a Melech . When can we see that the Guf influences the Guf inf luences the Guf Rosh ? Raising MAN makes Abba ve Ima turn Panim be Panim to make a Zivug on the Zivug on the Zivug Ohr Hoch- ma for passing it on to the lower Partzufim . Such a request of ZA to Abba ve Ima leads them to a state called the Sefira Da’at . As the vessels break, this desire in Abba ve Ima disappears and they terminate their Zivug . As the lower Partzuf turns to the upper with a request, it changes the way it is Partzuf turns t o the upper with a r eq ues t, it c hanges the w a y it is Partzuf controlled. When we long to change our state from below, we must raise MAN to the upper MAN t o the upper MAN Partzuf and receive correction. Partzuf and r eceiv e corr ection.

The first Partzuf of the world of AK emerged on Aviut de Behina Dalet, called the Peh, and the Partzuf AB of the world of AK emerged on Aviut de Behina Gimel, called the Hotem. The Partzuf SAG de AK emerged on Aviut de Behina Bet, called the Awzen. The Partzuf MA and the world of Nikudim emerged on Aviut de Behina Aleph, called Nikvey Eynaim. The Partzuf MA Hadash, or the world of correction (Atzilut), emerged on Aviut de Behina Shoresh, called the Metzah. Unlike all the other Partzufim, the name of Atzilut is determined not by the Aviut, but by the Hitlabshut Aleph, which plays a most significant role in the world of Atzilut. Therefore, it is not called BON, but MA Hadash. Does not the appearance of MA Hadash signify that up to now the entire way of Malchut of the World of Infinity was faulty? There is no such notion as “a mistake” in spirituality. The entire way is just phases of the rise of the genuine desire. Any level, even the lowest, corresponds to the entire Universe, re- ality. However, on the lowest levels, everything happens in the coarsest way, whereas on the highest levels it takes the most open, sophisticated and perfectly analyzed form. This difference provides all the strength, all the taste that is in the sensation of the Creator. There is NaRaNHaY on NaRaNHaY on NaRaNHaY all levels. All see the same picture, but everyone perceives it differently on various levels. Alternatively, rather, each level bears in itself a deeper attainment, which provides information that is more extensive. These sensations cannot possibly be expressed with words from our world. The lower level is unable to comprehend the upper one. אינן ג \" ס , ב \" ע ,\" גלגלתא \" הנקראות , ק \" דא הראשונות הקומות ' ג למה : להבין יש אמנם ( קיד ?\" עולם \" בשם להקרא ק \" דא ' הד פרצוף נשתנה ולמה ? פרצופים ' לג אלא , עולמות ' לג נבחנות בשם נקרא ' הה ופרצוף \" הנקודים עולם \" בשם נקרא ' הד פרצוף כי , ק \" דא החמישי פרצוף וכן .\" התיקון עולם \" בשם או \" האצילות עולם \""},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 369 114) We should understand why the three first levels of the world of AK are called Partzufim and not worlds. Why is the fourth level of AK called the world of Nikudim and the fifth – the world of Atzilut. The first three levels of AK, called Galgalta , AB and SAG, are Keter, Hochma, and Bina . Why is the fourth Partzuf (if it is just Partzuf (if it is jus t Partzuf ZA with the Aviut Aleph ) called “the world of Nikudim ” and the fifth (having only Aviut Shoresh ) – “the world of Atzilut ”? The dot is the light of Malchut in the Kli de Keter . The creation’s task is to expand this dot to the size of a complete, fully corrected Partzuf of Adam haRishon of A dam haRishon of . The preparation stages are: 1. The outer body is similar to our material (Homer) , “the dust of the earth”, i.e., the egoistic desire to receive pleasure. 2. Reaching the level of “Nefesh-Ruach” in the worlds Yetzira and Assiya and then “Neshama” in the world Beria . 3. Reaching the levels “Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama” in the world of Atzilut . 4. As a result of the “Sin”, Malchut falls from the world of Atzilut to the worlds of BYA and acquires the properties “the dust of the earth”, loses all its achievements in the world of Atzilut, and retains only the point of Keter . 5. The broken soul split into 600,000 fragments, from which our souls were formed. 6. Thus, the Behina Dalet , i.e., Adam HaRishon , emerged to begin correcting the intention. , ס \" ע קומת כל נקרא פרצוף בשם כי , והוא . לעולם מפרצוף ההפרש לידע וצריכים ( קטו יציאתו שאחר .( נ אות ) דעליון דראש בפה ונכלל שנזדכך אחר , דעליון דגוף המסך על היוצאת הנקראות , מזה למטה זה קומות ' ה בו יש גם . ס \" לרת בעצמו מתפשט הוא , דעליון מהראש . שבו הטעמים קומת שם על רק נקרא אמנם .( ז \" מ אות ) \" נקודות \" ו \" טעמים \" , פירושו \" עולם \" אבל .( ז \" מ אות ) ג \" ס , ב \" ע , גלגלתא : ק \" דא הראשונים פרצופים ' ג יצאו ז \" ועד בחותם שיש מה שכל , ונחתם חותם כעין , ממנו העליון בעולם שנמצא מה כל כולל שהוא . ממנו הנחתם על כולו עובר"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 370 115) We should know the difference between a Partzuf and a world. A Partzuf is any level consisting of ten Sefirot, which emerge as a result of Zivug with the Masach de Guf of the upper Partzuf upon the weakening of the Masach, and its merging with the Masach in the Peh de Rosh of the upper Partzuf. When it emerges from the Rosh of the upper Partzuf, it spreads to the Rosh, the Toch and the Sof and has 5 levels, one under the other, called the Ta’amim and the Nekudot. However, it receives its name only from the Ta’amim. Similarly, the three first Partzufim, Galgalta, AB and SAG of the world of AK, emerged and received names from their Ta’amim, Keter, Hochma and Bina. As far as the worlds are concerned, each consecutive world contains all that was in the preceding one, the way an imprint is the copy of a seal. The entire Torah is constructed from the Creator’s names. Each time man rises to a certain spiritual level and is filled with a certain kind of light, he feels this level and gives it a corresponding name, which he himself receives too. The Masach and the Ohr Hozer are called Ohr Hozer ar e called Ohr Hozer “Milluy” (filling), since the light filling the vessel depends on it. , אחד לעולם רק נבחנים , ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא הראשונים פרצופים ' שג , תבין זה ולפי ( קטז הצמצום ענין נעשה שבו , ק \" דא ' הד פרצוף אבל . הראשון בצמצום שיצא , ק \" הא עולם דהיינו למטה בירידתו ג \" דס דנקודות במסך שנעשה הכפילות מטעם , עצמו בפני לעולם נעשה ,' ב .( ג \" ס אות ) בעינים ת \" ה בסוד , ד \" דבחי העביות גם עליו נכפל כי . ק \" דא מטבור קומה ונמצאת .( ד \" פ אות ) כתר קומת והוציאה , לפה למקומה ד \" הבחי חזרה גדלות בעת אשר פרצוף עליו יצא , ובנקודות בטעמים ס \" לרת שנתפשט ואחר . ק \" דא ' הא לפרצוף נשתוה זו ואחר . ק \" דא ב \" ע הנקרא , ק \" דא ' ב לפרצוף דומה והוא . ת \" ישסו הנקרא , חכמה בקומת ' ב דומה והוא .( א \" קי אות ) דנקודים ה \" מ הנקרא ,' ג פרצוף יצא , ונקודות לטעמים התפשטותו . ק \" דא ' ג לפרצוף . זה תחת זה . פרצופים ' ג דהיינו , ק \" א בעולם שהיה מה כל הנקודים בעולם כאן שיצא הרי ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא פרצופים ' לג בדומה , מקריהם וכל ונקודות טעמים מהם אחד שבכל עולם זה משום ונקרא . ק \" הא מעולם נחתם שהוא , הנקודים עולם נבחן כ \" וע . ק \" הא שבעולם , ה \" ג-מ \" ב-ס \" ע אלא ג \" ב-ס \" גלגלתא-ע נקראים אינם נקודים פרצופי ' שג ומה ) . עצמו בפני שלם ההזדככות מקרה מפאת , שלמה עביותה אין ג \" דס במסך שנתחברה ד \" שהבחי מטעם הוא .( ה \" מ ג \" ס ב \" ע לבחינת ירדו כ \" וע . ק \" דא ' הא בפרצוף מכבר שהיה"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 371 116) As was already stated, the Partzufim of the world of AK, Gal- galta, AB and SAG, are called by one common name, AK. They emerged in accordance with TA. However, the fourth Partzuf (in which TB occurred) is called the world, because when Nekudot de SAG descended under the Tabur, they acquired the additional Reshi- mot Dalet/Gimel. During Gadlut, Behina Dalet returned to its place in the Peh de Rosh; the level of Keter emerged there, very similar to the first Partzuf of the world of AK. Then it spread to the Rosh, the Toch and the Sof, the Ta’amim and the Nekudot. The Partzuf Bet with the level of Ho- chma, called YESHSUT, follows. It is similar to the Partzuf AB de AK. Then the third Partzuf of the world of Nikudim arises. All three Partzufim stand one above the other; each has the Ta’amim and the Nekudot and all that is found in the three Partzufim of AK. Hence, Olam HaNikudim is considered an imprint, a mould of the world of AK and is called the world. The three Partzufim of the world of Nikudim should rather be called not Galgalta, AB and SAG, but AB, SAG and MA, since the Nekudot de SAG received only Dalet/Gimel (not Dalet/Dalet, which was in the Galgalta be- fore the light was expelled) from the NHYM de Galgalta. That is why the first Partzuf of the world of Nikudim (it adopted these Reshi- mot from the Nekudot de SAG and would later pass them on to the world of Atzilut) corresponds to AB (the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel and not Dalet/Dalet). , ק \" דא ' הה פרצוף נחתם ז \" ועד . ק \" הא מעולם נחתם הנקודים עולם איך נתבאר והנה ( קיז , בנקודים ששמשו הבחינות שכל באופן . הנקודים מעולם כולו שנחתם , החדש ה \" המ דהיינו . החדש ה \" במ ונתחדשו כולם חזרו מקום מכל , שם ונתבטלו שנשברו פ \" אע למעלה כולו שנסתיים מטעם ,\" האצילות עולם \" ונקרא . עצמו בפני עולם נקרא הוא כ \" וע , נתקיים לא הנקודים שעולם מטעם ,\" התיקון עולם \" כ \" ג ונקרא .' ב בצמצום שנתקנה , מפרסא בעולם שהיו , ההם הבחינות כל שחזרו , החדש ה \" במ כך אחר אלא . ושבירה ביטול בו היה כי באמת כי .\" התיקון עולם \" נקרא כ \" וע . ונתקיימו שם נתקנו הנה , החדש ה \" במ ובאו , הנקודים ה \" מ י \" ע כי . משלם תיקונו את החדש ה \" במ כאן שמקבל אלא , עצמו הנקודים עולם הוא"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 372 הפנים וכן , ת \" וישסו א \" או מן לגוף שנפלו האחורים אלו כל ר \" לג ומתחברים חוזרים החדש . לאצילות ידו על ועולים חוזרים , ומתו ע \" לבי שנפלו , ת \" הז דכל ואחורים 117) We know that the world of Nikudim is an imprint of the world of AK. Similarly, the fifth Partzuf de AK (MA Hadash) was formed. It is considered an exact copy of the world of Nikudim in the sense that all the Behinot used in Nikudim that broke and disappeared there were renewed and reconstructed in MA Hadash. This world is also considered independent and is called Atzilut. Its position is between the Parsa (formed after TB) and the Tabur. It is also called the world of Correction. After the world of Nikudim broke and disappeared, the world of Atzilut was formed from the same bro- ken Behinot. Thus, the world of Nikudim gets corrected with the help of MA Hadash, where all the AHP’s that fell into the Guf de Abba ve Ima and the YESHSUT gather and return to Gar. All the Panim and Achoraim of all the Zat, which fell into the BYA and died, now return and ascend to Atzilut with the help of MA Hadash. The Tabur is an imaginary line above which the light of Tabur is an imaginar y line abo v e whic h the light of Tabur Hochma may be received. Under the Tabur, there is no screen so far, so reception is forbidden. The Parsa is also an imaginary line; the vessels of bestowal (GE) that require no light of Hochma are above it, while the vessels of reception are below it and may not receive the light of Hochma . The world of Atzilut is between the Tabur de Galgalta and the Parsa . It is the world of Correction and has in it the Ohr Hochma . How can that be? This world elevates the fallen vessels of reception, attaches them to the vessels of bestowal, and fills them with the light of Hochma . This ac- tion takes place gradually. As soon as the AHP of all levels ascend to AHP of all lev els ascend t o AHP Atzi- lut , the state called Gmar Tikkun or the 7 th millennium will be achieved. Then there are also the 8 th , 9 th and 10 th millennia, when the AHP start to be filled with light under the Parsa as well. When the world of Atzilut lowers the AHP to the place of the world of AHP t o the place of the w orld of AHP Beria , the 8 th millen- nium will come. The AHP de Atzilut in Yetzira will mark the 9 th millen- nium and the AHP de Atzilut in Assiya will mark the 10 th millennium."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 373 Then absolutely every vessel will be filled with light in accordance with the Purpose of Creation.

When the light disappeared from the body of the first Partzuf de AK, due to the weakening of its screen, a new Zivug was made in the screen on the level of AB.Then it returned and filled the empty vessels of the upper Partzuf. After the expulsion of the light from the body of Partzuf AB, because of the screen weakening, a new Zivug was made in the screen on the level of SAG, which returned and filled the empty vessels of Partzuf AB. After the expulsion of the light from the body of Partzuf SAG, due to the weakening of the screen, a new Zivug was made in the screen on the level of MA, which emerged from Nikvey Eynaim and filled the empty vessels of SAG. Similarly, after the expulsion of the light from the world of Nikudim, due to the disappearance of the Achoraim and the breaking of the vessels, a new Zivug made in the screen on the level of MA, emerged from the Metzah of Partzuf SAG de AK and filled the empty vessels of the world of Nikudim, which broke and disappeared."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 374 We have always studied the development of creation “from above”. The Creator created the only creation – Malchut of the World of Infinity. It constitutes the unity of all desires (vessels) and pleasures (the light). Whatever happens afterwards is just a sequence of various intentions Malchut uses in order to fill itself. We learn that Malchut gradually begins to move away from the Creator to become fully independent of Him. Malchut stops feeling the Creator, coarsens, transforms its proper- ties into egoistic ones and becomes opposite to the Creator, infinitely re- mote from Him. When the process of evolution reaches its lowest point, the creation is ready to begin the reverse process – gradual advancement towards the Creator. Each higher Partzuf is nearer to perfection that the previous one, Partzuf is near er t o per f ection that the pr evious one, Partzuf has a stronger screen, and is closer to the Creator. How can it be that each consecutive Partzuf fills the preceding one with light, although it Partzuf f ills the pr eceding one with light, although it Partzuf is weaker? Does it not originate from it? It fills the preceding Partzuf by Partzuf b y Partzuf demanding to be filled. When the Partzuf Galgalta completely expels the light, its Masach de Guf merges with the de Guf mer ges with the de Guf Masach de Rosh and the lower level of Aviut disap- pears. A new Partzuf is born and demands strength from the previous Partzuf is born and demands s tr ength fr om the pr evious Partzuf in order to fill itself with the light. To receive such light, the preceding Partzuf has to make a Partzuf has t o mak e a Partzuf Zivug de Haka’a with the light of Infinity, decrease the intensity of this light by one degree to pass it to the lower level, which feels it in the Rosh and perceives it as the light of the World of Infinity. For instance, Malchut of the world of Assiya sees the light dimin- ished 125 times in its Rosh , but perceives it as the light of the World of Infinity, although it passed through all 125 degrees of weakening. Mal- chut perceives it as absolute Infinity. The filling of the preceding Partzuf happens through the consecutive Partzuf’s desire to be filled with the light of the preceding one. When SAG asks AB to fill it with the light, AB , having nothing, turns to Galgalta , which has nothing else to do but to ask Malchut of The"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 375 World of Infinity for the light. Why is it so? We say that the entire light is in the Rosh de Galgalta . It is really so, but it must now give SAG the appro- priate light of Bina . Therefore, Galgalta turns to Malchut of The World of Infinity, or, rather, to its Behina Bet , which corresponds to the light of Bina . It passes this light first through Bina de Galgalta , then through Bina de AB and only then to the Rosh de SAG . Overall, there are five Partzufim and five lights. The Partzuf receives Partzuf r eceiv es Partzuf each light from Malchut of the World of Infinity, or, rather, from one of its Sefirot . Any Bina of any Partzuf or world can receive the light of Partzuf or w orld can r eceiv e the light of Partzuf Bina only through all Binot of all the Partzufim and worlds preceding it. The other Sefirot – Keter , Hochma , ZA and Malchut – receive the light by including themselves in the desires of the requesting vessel. The consecu- tive Partzuf complements the preceding one with the desires (the vessels), Partzuf com plements the pr eceding one with the desir es (the v essels), Partzuf while the preceding Partzuf fills these desires with the light. Partzuf f ills these desir es with the light. Partzuf The lower Partzuf always turns to the upper, from which it originat- Partzuf alw a y s turns t o the upper , fr om whic h it originat- Partzuf ed. The Partzuf AB emerges from Hochma de Galgalta and is connected with Galgalta only through Hochma. Galgalta turns to the Sefirat Hochma of Malchut of Malc hut of of the World of Infinity, receives Ohr Hochma , but cannot pass it to AB . It must transform it into Ohr Hochma that would suit AB, and only then pass it on to it. The smallest, but true request of the tiniest Partzuf fills all the Partzuf f ills all the Partzuf worlds up to Galgalta with the light. At that, the higher the Partzuf is, the Partzuf is, the Partzuf more light it receives. Therefore, being filled with the light, the Tree of Life is revived by the raised MAN . להכלים עליון ובחינת דכר לבחינת נעשה הוא כי . החדש ה \" במ כאן גדול הפרש יש אמנם ( קיט ולעליון לדכר נעשה התחתון אין , הקודמים בפרצופים כ \" משא . אותם מתקן שהוא , דנקודים . קומתו י \" ע אותם ממלא שהוא פ \" אע , דעליון דגוף הכלים אל רק כי , האורות בהסתלקות פגם שום היה לא הקודמים בפרצופים כי , הוא הזה והשינוי . להסתלקותם גרם המסך הזדככות בהכלים מעורב היה המסיימת מלכות כח כי . בהכלים פגם היה , הנקודים בעולם כאן אבל הם לפיכך . ע \" לבי ונפלו ומתו נשברו זו שמסבה . האורות לקבל ראוים ואינם . ת \" דז דאחורים ה \" המ נחשב זה ומתוך . לאצילות ולהעלותם , לבררם , להחיותם : החדש ה \" במ לגמרי תלויים"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 376 אל נוקבא בחינת נעשו ידו על הנבררים דנקודים הכלים ואלו . ומשפיע זכר לבחינת החדש עליון שהם פ \" ואע . ה \" המ אל תחתון בחינת שנעשו כלומר . ן \" ב לשם שמם נשתנה ולכן . ה \" המ הוא שבו עליונה שבחינה , עינים ונקבי ה \" מ ובחינת הנקודים מעולם כלים הם כי , החדש ה \" למ . האמור מטעם ן \" ב ונקרא . החדש ה \" המ אל לתחתון עתה נעשו מ \" מ ,( ד \" ע אות ) ק \" דא ג \" דס ק \" ו 119) However, there is a fundamental distinction in MA Hadash, called the world of Atzilut. It consists in the fact that, being the Partzuf that follows the world of Nikudim, it affects and corrects all of its vessels. However, in the previous Partzufim, each lower one could not influence the Kelim de Guf of the upper one, even though it filled them with the light of its level. This change in MA happened because the power of Malchut restrict- ing the light in the world of Nikudim intervened with the AHP de Zat. This led to the loss of the screen, expulsion of the light, breaking of the vessels, their death and fall into BYA. In the previous Partzu- fim, there was no “spoiling” of the vessels during the light expulsion, which was connected exclusively with the weakening of the screen and its rising to the Rosh of the Partzuf. However, here in the world of Nikudim, the vessels become spoiled and their existence now depends on the world of Atzilut, which has power to correct and lift them up. Hence, the world of Atzilut is considered new and bestowing (Zachar) as regards the vessels of the world of Nikudim (Nekeva in regards to it); hence, they change their name from Nikudim (the Aviut of MA) to BON, i.e., they descend below MA Hadash. The world of Nikudim emerged on the Masach in Nikvey Eynaim (Bina de Hochma) ; the world of Atzilut emerged on the Masach in Nikvey Eynaim de Metzah (Bina de Keter) of the Rosh de SAG. The world of Nikudim was supposed to be MA and Atzilut – BON , but owing to the breaking of the vessels, they switch places: Atzilut becomes MA , while the broken vessels of Nikudim, which it attaches to itself, become the BON ."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 377 F I V E PA R T Z U F I M O F T H E W O R L D O F A T Z I L U T , M A A N D B O N I N E A C H PA R T Z U F פרצוף שבכל ן \" וב ה \" מ וענין אצילות פ \" ה . הנקודים עולם כמו עצמו בפני שלם לעולם כ \" ג נתפשטה החדש ה \" מ שקומת , ונתבאר ( קכ 120) Now, the MA Hadash turned into an independent world like the Nikudim. Each Partzuf in the world of Partzuf in the w orld of Partzuf AK emerged on one pair of AK emer ged on one pair of AK Reshimot (e.g. Dalet/Dalet etc.).

The first brought forth the world of Nikudim in Katnut , whereas the second gave rise to a series of Partzufim similar to AB - SAG . The world of Atzilut emerged on Aleph de Hitlabshut and Shoresh de Aviut , although the Reshimo Dalet-Gimel remains. Therefore, a second desire emerges in the Masach , which also rises to the Rosh de SAG : to receive light from Dalet-Gimel . Therefore, as with the world Nikudim , Atzilut also initially emerges in Katnut , and then wants to pass to Gadlut . אות ) ד \" מבחי גם המסך כפילות מכח שהוא , הנקודים בקומת שנתבאר כמו , הוא הדבר וטעם הצמצום החזירה דנקודים ר \" לג והיסוד הטבור דרך שהאיר ק \" דא ן \" הזו שהארת הגם כי .( ז \" קט אות ) נקודים דגדלות הקומות אלו כל יצאו ז \" שעי , לפה עינים מנקבי ירדה ת \" וה , למקומו ' א הצמצום חזר כ \" וע . נסתלקו האורות וכל , ונשברו ונתבטלו חזרו הקומות אלו כל אמנם ,( א \" ק . במסך ונתחברה חזרה ד \" והבחי . למקומו ' ב The luminescence of ZON de AK through the Tabur and Yesod in the Gar de Nikudim returned Malchut from Bina to its place, i.e., from the Nikvey Eynaim to the Peh.

TB returned to its place; Behina Dalet joined the Masach. The state of Gadlut , which happened in the world of Nikudim , also took place in Atzilut , although according to the laws that prevented the vessels from breaking. בעולם כמו , וגדלות קטנות בחינות ' ב כ \" ג נוהג , מהמצח שיצא , החדש ה \" במ גם ולפיכך ( קכא א \" ז קומת : שהוא , במסך המגולה העביות לפי דהיינו , הקטנות יוצאת תחילה אשר . הנקודים שנעשה , הקוין ' ג מטעם . י \" נה הנקרא , דעביות מלכות וקומת , ת \" חג המכונה , דהתלבשות אמנם .\" יסוד \" אמצעי וקו ,\" הוד \" נקרא שמאל וקו ,\" נצח \" נקרא ימין שקו : מלכות בקומת ת \" חג קומת ונמצאה . כלים בה אין כ \" ע , עביות בלי , התלבשות בחינת רק א \" מבחי שאין כיון אלא שם שאין , שפירושו .\" עובר \" נקראת זו וקומה . י \" דנה בכלים מתלבשת והיא . כלים בלי , שקומה . דעליון במצח לזווג עליתו בעת , הזדככותו אחר במסך שנשאר , דשורש עביות שיעור ת \" ה בחינת והוא . בגניזו ת \" ה בחינת יש בפנימיותה אמנם . מלכות קומת רק היא , שם היוצאת מוחין מקבל ואז .( ד \" נ אות ) למקומו משם יורד , בעליון הזווג מקבל שהעובר ואחר . במצח , ת \" לחג גם כלים קונה ז \" ועי . עינים בנקבי ת \" ה בבחינת , א \" דבחי עביות שהם , מהעליון דיניקה . א \" ז קומת לו ויש . י \" הנה מתוך ת \" החג מתפשטים 121) Therefore, as in the world of Nikudim, the two forces also rule in MA Hadash, which emerged from Metzah: Katnut and Gadlut, i.e., first Katnut on Hitlabshut Aleph (ZA,) called the HaGaT, and Malchut (Shoresh) de Aviut, called NHY, due to the appearance of “three lines” in it. The three lines are the right line (Netzah), the left line (Hod) and the middle line (Yesod). However, since there is only the Behinat Hitlabshut without the Aviut in the Behina Aleph, it has no Kelim, so the level of the HaGaT, for the lack of its own ves- sels, uses the Kelim de NHY. Such a Partzuf is called Ubar (embryo). Then it grows to the Aviut Aleph and receives the name of Katan (small). Upon reaching the Aviut Gimel, it enters Gadlut. There were only two states in the world of Nikudim: Katnut and Gadlut ; and three – in Atzilut . Gadlut was instantly born in AK . The world of Nikudim is called ZA or the HaGaT ; the world of Atzilut is first called Ubar or Ubar or Ubar NHY , then Katan (ZA) , or HaGaT-NHY . In Gadlut, it is called HaBaD-HaGaT-NHY, the Aviut Bet-Gimel-Dalet. When the Partzuf"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 379 is born in the state of Ubar , it has Aviut de Shoresh , the vessel of Keter and Keter and Keter the lights Nefesh and Ruach . So where is Ohr Ruach ? It turns out to be together with Ohr Nefesh . However, it is true that Malchut hides inside the Ubar , for Reshimo Dalet- Gimel , on which a Zivug was not made, is still there. Later on, in the Zivug w as no t made, is s till ther e. Lat er on, in the Zivug state of Aviut de Shoresh, state of A viut de Shor esh, state of the Ubar receives light from the previous Ubar r eceiv es light fr om the pr evious Ubar Partzuf and grows to Aviut Aleph, while the screen descends from the Metzah to Nikvey Eynaim (de Eynaim). The Partzuf in this state is called Partzuf in this s t at e is called Partzuf Katan . If the screen descends lower, the Partzuf will be in Partzuf will be in Partzuf Gadlut , gradually passing from Aviut Bet to Gimel and then to Dalet . When a Partzuf is born, it means that a screen is born, no more. Partzuf is born, it means that a scr een is born, no mor e. Partzuf Desires are created by the Creator, while the light preceded the desires. Now only the intention to receive for the sake of the Creator is brought forth. The screen is an inversion of what I may do with the pleasure I can feel. The entire ladder, from us to the Creator, is graduated in ac- cordance with the screens – from 0%, the lowest level, up to 100%, the highest level. The Partzuf is a measure of the screen’s reaction to the Partzuf is a measur e of the scr een’s r eaction t o the Partzuf Upper Light. After its birth, the Partzuf instantly descends to its place Partzuf ins t antly descends t o its place Partzuf according to its screen. In TB, only GE (the vessels of bestowal) are used in all the states of the Partzuf from Partzuf fr om Partzuf Shoresh to Dalet . ג \" ס ב \" מע מוחין שם ומקבל .\"' ב עיבור \" ונקרא . להעליון ן \" למ ' ב פעם עולה ז \" אח והנה ( קכב ד \" בחי על הזווג נעשה ואז .( א \" ק אות ) לפה למקומה עינים מנקבי ד \" הבחי יורדת ואז . ק \" דא ונשלם . בראש למקומם וחוזרים מתעלים פ \" דאח והכלים . כתר בקומת ס \" ע ויוצאות . במקומה קומת וזהו . הפרצוף של \" דגדלות מוחין \" נקראים המוחין ואלו . וכלים דאורות ס \" בע הפרצוף . דאצילות \" עתיק פרצוף \" או \" הכתר פרצוף \" הנקרא , דאצילות ' הא פרצוף 122) After its birth in Katnut, the Partzuf raises MAN for the sec- ond time in the Rosh de SAG, and is called the Ibur Bet (the 2 nd conception). There it receives Mochin, i.e., the light AB-SAG of the world of AK. Then Behina Dalet descends from Nikvey Eynaim to its place in Peh de Rosh. A Zivug on Behina Dalet gives birth to 10 Sefirot de Keter. The vessels of AHP return to its place in the Rosh. Thus, the Partzuf is extended to 10 Sefirot (both the vessels and the"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 380 lights). This light is called the Mochin de Gadlut of the Partzuf. This is how the first Partzuf of the world of Atzilut, called Keter or Atik de Atzilut, emerged. The name Atik derives from the word “ Ne’etak” , i.e., isolated from the rest of the lower Partzufim . It is a kind of intermediary between the worlds of AK and AK and AK Atzilut . Atik works according to the laws of TA , but dresses in “Searot” (the outer Partzufim ), which is already in Rosh de SAG and is perceived by other Partzufim as the Partzuf that exists according to Partzuf that e xis ts accor ding t o Partzuf the laws of TB . Concerning Galgalta, the Atik is on the level of Hochma , since it emerges on Reshimo Dalet-Gimel . This corresponds to the Partzuf AB (Hochma de Galgalta) . As regards the world of Atzilut , it is the first Partzuf of the level of Partzuf of the lev el of Partzuf Keter , which initiates the entire network of Partzu- fim of the world of Atzilut , to which it will bestow. In fact, Keter de Atzilut is not Atik , which is so isolated and con- cealed that it is practically unable to contact any other Partzuf . It passes Partzuf . It passes Partzuf its functions to the second Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Atzilut –Arich Anpin , which is in fact Keter and carries out all corrections of the vessels. Keter and carries out all corr ections of the v essels. Keter Four out of 6 volumes of “The Study of the Ten Sefirot” speak about the world of Atzilut . The general control of the entire Universe, the connection between the souls and the Creator, originates there. Almost nothing is said about Atik , since it, as it were, has nothing to do with the world of Atzilut . Actually, Atzilut begins with Arich An- pin , which, as regards all the other Partzufim , plays the role of Galgalta of the world of AK . All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are also dressed on it. למדרגה אחד כל , מהמדרגות פ \" אח כלהו ונפלו חזרו כ \" שביה שאחר , ידעת וכבר ( קכג פ \" ואח . חכמה דקומה ע \" בגו דנקודים כתר דקומת פ \" אח ונמצאים .( ו \" ק , ז \" ע אות ) שמתחתיו , דאצילות ' הא דפרצוף דגדלות ' ב העיבור בעת ולפיכך .' וכו , בינה דקומת ע \" בגו חכמה דקומת . חכמה דקומת ע \" הגו גם יחד עמהם עלו הנה , שלו פ \" האח ונתעלו שחזרו ,\" עתיק \" הנקרא .' הא עיבור שם וקבלו . עתיק דקומת פ \" האח עם יחד ונתקנו"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 381 123) You already know that, after the breaking of the vessels, all the AHP fell again from their level to the one below. The AHP of Keter de Nikudim is now on the level of the GE de Hochma. The AHP of Hochma is on the level of GE de Bina, and so on. Now, during Ibur Bet, i.e., in Gadlut of the Partzuf Atik, its AHP rose, with GE de Hochma, and was corrected together. The GE de Hochma reached Behinat Ibur Aleph. When a Partzuf is born in Partzuf is born in Partzuf Katnut , its AHP do not receive the light AHP do no t r eceiv e the light AHP and are inside GE of the lower level. As the upper Partzuf starts lifting its Partzuf s t ar ts lif ting its Partzuf AHP and filling them with the light, the AHP and f illing them with the light, the AHP Reshimot GE of the lower still unborn Partzuf rise together with them. The Partzuf rise t oge ther with them. The Partzuf AHP of the upper AHP of the upper AHP Partzuf prepare a place for the birth of this Partzuf . The upper Partzuf . The upper Partzuf Partzuf passes Partzuf passes Partzuf through Ibur Bet , while GE of the lower Partzuf pass through Partzuf pass thr ough Partzuf Ibur Aleph . Thus, the fall of each AHP by one level created an opportunity, with their return to the original level, to elevate and correct GE of the lower level, in other words, their fall allowed GE of the lower Partzuf to Partzuf t o Partzuf enter Ibur Aleph , while the upper Partzuf entered Partzuf ent er ed Partzuf Ibur Bet . After the breaking of the vessels in the world of Nikudim , the egois- tic desires without a screen (Reshimot) remained. They cannot come out of that state by themselves. Because there are Reshimot of the GE of the following Partzuf in all the fallen Partzuf in all the f allen Partzuf AHP , it becomes possible to correct the GE of the lower Partzuf during the rise and correction of the Partzuf during the rise and corr ection of the Partzuf AHP . The miracle of TB and the breaking of the vessels lie in this process. לראש ועלו חזרו ,( א \" קכ אות ) שלהם והיניקה העיבור קומת קבלו דחכמה ע \" שהגו ואחר ( קכד עליה ויצאו . לפה למקומה ג \" הבחי וירדה . דגדלות למוחין שלהם ' ב עיבור שם וקבלו . דעתיק החכמה פרצוף ונשלם . בראש למקומם ועלו חזרו שלהם פ \" דאח והכלים . חכמה בקומת ס \" ע . דאצילות \" אנפין אריך \" פרצוף נקרא זה ופרצוף . וכלים דאורות ס \" בע 124) After the GE de Hochma pass through the Ibur and the Yenika (Ibur Aleph, Katnut), Hochma passes to Ibur Bet, so as to receive Mochin de Gadlut. Then Behina Gimel descends to the Peh de Rosh, and a Zivug on it forms all the 10 Sefirot de Hochma; its AHP rises"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 382 and accomplishes this level. In this way, the Gadlut of the second Partzuf de Atzilut, called the Arich Anpin, emerged. The transition to Gadlut happens with the help of the light AB- SAG , which allows the acquisition of a screen and begins to work with the vessels of reception ( the AHP). Arich Anpin means a long face. Ho- chma symbolizes a face. “Long” suggests that there is a lot of Ohr Hochma in Arich Anpin , unlike in ZA (small face), where there is just a little Ohr Hochma . When the creation begins to understand the Creator’s great- ness with the help of the light AB-SAG, it starts working with the previ- ously unused vessels of reception. ויניקה ' הא עיבור שם וקבלו . בינה דקומת ע \" גו גם ביחד עלו א \" דא הללו פ \" אח ועם ( קכה ונשלם . דגדלות המוחין וקבלו שלהם פ \" האח והעלו .' ב לעיבור א \" דא לראש עלו ז \" ואח . שלהם , א \" או נקראות ר \" הג כי . ת \" וישסו א \" או נקרא זה ופרצוף . וכלים דאורות ס \" בע הבינה פרצוף . ת \" ישסו נקראות ת \" והז 125) The vessels of GE de Bina rose together with the AHP de Arich Anpin and received Ibur Aleph and Yenika there. Then they rose to the Rosh de Arich Anpin for Ibur Bet, lifted their AHP and received Mochin de Gadlut. Next, the Partzuf of Bina began using all of its 10 Sefirot, both the vessels and the lights. This third Partzuf of the world of Atzilut is called Abba ve Ima and YESHSUT, where Abba ve Ima are Gar de Bina and YESHSUT is Zat de Bina. GE has Aviut Shoresh and Aleph . When the Partzuf passes all the Partzuf passes all the Partzuf stages of the screen's formation, Shoresh , Aleph , Bet , Gimel and Dalet of the Aviut de Shoresh , it constitutes conception. Then the screen emerges on Shoresh , Aleph , Bet , Gimel, and Dalet of Aviut de Aleph . This is the Yeni- ka and the birth of the Partzuf in Partzuf in Partzuf Katnut , i.e., the use of only the GE (the Aviut Shoresh and Aleph ). Then this Partzuf rises again to the Partzuf rises again t o the Partzuf Rosh of the previous one. This is a stage of Ibur Bet (the second conception). Then, it lifts its AHP and receives AHP and r eceiv es AHP Mochin de Gadlut , i.e., the full 10 Sefirot ."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 383 . והיניקה שלהם ' א העיבור שם וקבלו . ן \" דזו ע \" גו גם ביחד עלו א \" דאו הללו פ \" אח ועם ( קכו שיצאו , החדש ה \" מ פ \" ה נתבארו והנה . להנוקבא ונקודה א \" לז ק \" ו בבחינת ן \" הזו נשלמים ובזה . ן \" וזו א \" או א \" א עתיק הנקראים , קביעות בבחינת האצילות בעולם שהוא , ונקודה ק \" בו ן \" וזו , בינה בקומת א \" ואו , חכמה בקומת א \" וא , כתר בקומת יצא שעתיק התחתונים מעשי אין ר \" בג כי . לעולם מיעוט שום יארע לא הקומות ' ה ובאלו . א \" ז קומת דוקא היינו , התחתונים מעשי מגיעים שאליהם , ונוקבא א \" וז . לפוגמם שיוכלו , אליהם מגיעים ק \" דו באורות ע \" גו שהם , דפנים בכלים אבל . הגדלות בעת שמשיגים , שלהם דאחורים בכלים לבחינת ל \" הנ הקומות ' ה נבחנים ולפיכך . התחתונים מעשי יגיעו לא בהם גם הנה , ונקודה . באצילות הקבועים מוחין 126) GE de ZON rose together with AHP de Abba ve Ima and YESHSUT and received Ibur Aleph and Yenika there. Thus, the Partzuf ZON was completed and reached the level of Vak de ZA and Nekudah de Nukvah. So all five Partzufim of the world of MA Hadash or Atzilut are in its minimal state: Atik, Arich Anpin, Abba ve Ima and ZON. The Partzuf Atik emerged on the level of Keter, Arich Anpin – on the level of Hochma; Abba ve Ima is on the level of Bina and the ZON is on the level of Vak and Nekudah, i.e., ZA and Malchut. There cannot be any descent of these five levels. No actions of the lower Partzufim can reach Atik, Arich Anpin and Abba ve Ima, so they are unable to spoil them. As far as ZA and Nukvah are concerned, as they achieve Gadlut, the actions of the lower spiritual objects (the souls) can reach only their AHP, but not their GE. The lower objects are the souls in the AHP de ZON of the world of Atzilut . They cannot correct themselves, but can raise MAN to ZON de Atzilut , which raise their AHP . As MAN makes a Zivug on them, it simul- taneously gives birth to Katnut of the particular soul. The task consists in providing the broken vessels with a new screen and gradually filling them with light. This work is carried out from down up. It starts with the less egoistic vessels and ends with the coarsest and most egoistic, i.e., proceeds from the easy-to-correct vessels to the most difficult. The work begins with the birth of the world of Atzilut ."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 384 After the vessels break, the screen ascends to Rosh de SAG and makes a Zivug de Haka’a on the purest Reshimot , which results in the emergence of the first Partzuf Atik . Then Atik makes a Zivug on the purest Zivug on the pur es t Zivug Reshimot, which leads to the emergence of Arich Anpin . Arich Anpin takes the purest of the remaining Reshimot and makes a Zivug on them, which Zivug on them, whic h Zivug creates the Partzuf Abba ve Ima . From the remaining Reshimot, Abba ve Ima create the ZON . After that, a Zivug could be made on no more pure Zivug could be made on no mor e pur e Zivug Reshimot . Only the Reshimot that can lead to Katnut of the world of Atzilut are activated. Similarly, Katnut of the world of Nikudim was created in its own time. These worlds resemble one another; the difference being that Atzilut is constructed so that the vessels in it cannot break. Actually, there are 12 Partzufim in the world of Atzilut . Each of them is divided into two parts: up and down, left and right, etc. All these intermediate states are created for using the AHP to the maximum, cor- AHP t o the maximum, cor - AHP recting them without breaking the vessels. How can the AHP be used after the breaking of the vessels, when AHP be used af t er the br eaking of the v essels, when AHP they are forbidden to use? TA and TB must not be violated. However, TA is in effect forever, while TB - only during 6000 levels. The entire process of correction is controlled by TB . What is the meaning of Tzimtzum Bet ? Out of five desires, only Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma , which are almost unselfish, may be used. The three remaining desires, Bina , ZA, and Malchut , i.e., the AHP, are not to be used for their egoistic nature; they require great willpower, a very strong screen. After TB, the Kelim that have no strength to work with the egois- tic vessels emerge. Nevertheless, the desires do not disappear. It is only possible to forbid their use. The desires of GE may be used only within certain limits. When you are in Katnut , you do not receive anything and enjoy only the equivalence of properties with the Creator. You are simi- lar to the Creator – that is a lot, but insufficient for fulfilling the Purpose of Creation, which is being filled with the light of Hochma . To achieve"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 385 that, you need to have the vessels of reception. Such an opportunity is yet unavailable to you. The only solution is to use the egoistic vessels of the AHP , includ- ing them in the altruistic GE . The vessels of AHP want to receive AHP w ant t o r eceiv e AHP Ohr Hochma exclusively, which is forbidden. Only the light of Hassadim may be received. However, when the light of Hochma is pushed away, a small amount of it enters the vessels. The AHP may be used only if they are AHP ma y be used only if the y ar e AHP lifted above the Parsa . If all the AHP in the world of AHP in the w orld of AHP Nikudim were lifted above the Parsa , and the light of Hochma received in 10 Sefirot formed in this manner, the vessels would not have broken. The AHP can be AHP can be AHP lifted and filled with light only if this light will be passed on to the lower Partzuf . That is one of corrections made by the world of Partzuf . That is one of corr ections made b y the w orld of Partzuf Atzilut . Raising MAN, filling the lower Partzufim with light, in answer to a request for correction, corrects the broken vessels, from which they receive portions of the light. Thus, the system of spreading and receiving (Kabbalah) light emerges in the spiritual world. Similarly, one can come to reveal the Creator only in a group of those who wish to be corrected by joining the system of circulation of Kabbalah. Desires are constant; they are our very essence created by the Creator. We cannot change ourselves, but we can modify our intentions. There is no need to work on actions, only on the intentions that accompany them. The purpose of your actions is either your own good feeling, the health of your family, money, or the reward to be received from the Creator in the world to come – all this remains within the limits of your egoism. It is a very different matter if the Creator endows you with an op- portunity to realize His greatness to such an extent that, whatever you do, is only for His sake. This requires the Creator’s revelation. Only constant, persistent, work with books and in a group under the guid- ance of a true Teacher can attract the Surrounding Light and lead to the Creator’s revelation. The spiritual path does not begin with an action, but with inner reflection."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 386 Nothing disappears in the spiritual realm. This rule applies to the souls. Today I am on a certain level, tomorrow I will pass to another. All my previous states are included in this new one. Today I can still re- member what happened 20 years ago. The past states are rather lit up by today’s condition. The light that shines in the present also fills the past. In the Gmar Tikkun, all the previous states are condensed into one big Partzuf filled completely with light. All the successive vessels give ad- Partzuf f illed com ple t ely with light. All the successiv e v essels giv e ad- Partzuf ditional desires to those preceding them so that each time they receive a more powerful light. All the screens broke together with the vessels. During the correc- tion, they start growing from zero to 100%. New desires for which you do not have a screen are added to provide for passage to the next level, whereas the previous one has exhausted itself. Such a state is called a fall. A moment ago, you were in a wonderful state, you had a screen, but now you “have fallen”. You were given more egoistic desires; hence, you do not want anything spiritual. In this state, some serious inner work must be done in order to acquire a new screen, which will allow you to receive an even more pow- erful light. The work on the screen consists only in active studies. At the first encounter with “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kab- balah”, the human brain cannot comprehend all the information; it creates confusion, especially while studying the world of the Nikudim , then Atzilut and so on. One should stop for a while, contemplate about the things heard and perhaps review the previous chapters. Listening to audio cassettes is highly recommended. Gradually the material settles down and is absorbed, because building the spiritual vessels (and that is exactly what happens to you), requires time and efforts. מראש שיצא פ \" אע דאצילות עתיק פרצוף כי , הוא ק \" א ולפרצוף ז \" זא הלבשתם וסדר ( קכז למטה רק ק \" דא ג \" דס ולמטה מפה להלביש יכול לא מקום מכל ,( ח \" קי אות ) ק \" דא ג \" הס .\" עקודים \" ונקרא ,' א צמצום בחינת הוא ק \" דא מטבור למעלה כי . מטבור"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 387 . בו שולט ' ב הצמצום אין עדיין , דאצילות ' הא ראש בחינת להיותו , עתיק שפרצוף , אמת והן , דראשו בפה נתקן כבר ' ב שהצמצום כיון אמנם . ק \" דא מטבור למעלה שילביש ראוי היה כ \" וא . ק \" דא מטבור למטה רק להלביש יכול אינו כ \" ע , ולמטה שממנו , אצילות פרצופי שאר בשביל למעלה דהיינו , ק \" א רגלי עם בשוה מסתיימת והיא . ק \" דא מטבור מתחלת עתיק קומת ונמצא , אצילות פרצופי שאר עם התקשרותו מפאת אמנם . עצמו פרצופו מפאת וזהו . ז \" דעוה מנקודה מסתיימים שרגליו נבחן הוא זו מבחינה הנה ,' ב מצמצום כ \" ג כלול שהוא נבחן שמבחינתם .( ח \" ס אות ) ' ב הצמצום של החדש הסיום הוא הפרסא כי . דאצילות מפרסא למעלה 127) The Partzufim “dress” one onto the other in the following way: although Atik de Atzilut emerged from the Rosh de SAG of the world of AK, it cannot dress onto SAG from the Peh to the Tabur, but only under the Tabur, since above it, the power of the TA rules entirely. It is also known that the Partzuf Atik (its alternative name is Aku- dim) is essentially the first Rosh of the world of Atzilut, where the TB does not rule yet; so, in principle, it can dress onto the AK above the Tabur. However, TB comes into effect in the Rosh de Atik with regard to the subsequent Partzufim of Atzilut; hence, Atik dresses onto AK only under the Tabur. The level of Atik stretches from the Tabur to the Sium de AK, i.e., above the point of our world. This refers to Atik itself. As far as its connection with the rest of the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut is concerned, it is considered to be ruled by TB; from this point of view its feet end above the Parsa de Atzilut (new Sium of TB). Therefore, there are two kinds of Atik : one abides by the laws of TA , while the other obeys TB . All the other Partzufim of the world of Atzi- lut born after Atik submit to the laws of TB . Atik contains all information about all the Partzufim that follow it, down to our world. All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut emerged in the state of Katnut . They do not require the light of Hochma , although they can pass to Gadlut at any time, receive this light through a request of the lower Partzufim , and transfer it to them."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 388 Out of all the Reshimot left from the breaking of the vessels, Partzuf Atik selects the purest, the best, and makes a Zivug on the level of Zivug on the lev el of Zivug Keter . As Atik reaches its ultimate state, it transfers only the Ohr Hochma and gives birth to the Partzuf Arich Anpin . Similarly, Arich Anpin chooses the purest Reshimot related to Bina and creates the Partzuf Abba ve Ima . קומתו הנה , עתיק דראש מפה ויצא נאצל שהוא , א \" א הנקרא , החדש ה \" דמ ' הב ופרצוף ( קכח המסתיימים , דעתיק ת \" הז את ומלביש . עתיק דראש מפה דהיינו , יציאתו ממקום מתחיל מתחילים הם , א \" א דראש מפה שנאצלו , א \" או הנקרא ,' הג ופרצוף . דאצילות מפרסא למעלה ומסתיימים א \" דא מטבור מתחילים ן \" והזו . א \" דא מטבור למעלה ומסתיימים א \" א דראש מפה . דאצילות מפרסא למעלה דהיינו , א \" א סיום עם בשוה 128) The second Partzuf of the world of Atzilut is called Arich An- pin. It emerges from the Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf Atik and dresses onto its seven lower Sefirot, which end above the Parsa de Atzilut. The third Partzuf of the world of Atzilut, called Abba ve Ima, emerg- es from the Peh de Rosh of Arich Anpin and ends above the Tabur de Arich Anpin. The fourth and fifth Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, called ZON, stretch from the Tabur de Arich Anpin to the Sium de Arich Anpin, i.e., above the Parsa de Atzilut. Atik emerges from the Metzah of Rosh de SAG and under the influ- ence of TA spreads from the Tabur de Galgalta down to its Sium . TA can no longer affect the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. Atik is created ac- cording to the laws of TA , since it receives light from the Partzufim of the world of AK (created according to the laws of AK (cr eat ed accor ding t o the la w s of AK TA ), but it then transforms the light for the lower Partzufim , ruled by TB . Arich Anpin, born from Atik, spreads from the Peh de Rosh de Atik down to the Parsa . The third Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Atzilut, called Abba ve Ima, emerges from the Peh de Rosh of Arich Anpin and ends at the level of the Tabur de Arich Anpin. Abba ve Ima, i.e., Bina de Atzilut , gives birth to two Partzufim that can be viewed as one: ZA and Malchut or ZON . This Partzuf dresses onto Partzuf dr esses ont o Partzuf ZON de Arich Anpin and reaches the Parsa . Later on we will study how the world of Atzilut changes, affected by the upper and the lower spiritual objects. Stimulation from above is ex-"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 389 pressed in holidays, Sabbaths, the beginnings of months, which appear regardless of what happens below in the worlds of the BYA . Stimulation from below comes from the souls in the worlds of BYA , which demand from Atzilut to be elevated, corrected, and filled with light. In this case, Atzilut is obliged to react to the request from below. This reaction in- cludes the reception of light from above and passing it on down. As in the world of Nikudim , there are six upper Sefirot of Sefirot o f Sefirot ZA called ZA c a l l e d ZA HaBaD-HaGaT in HaBaD-HaGaT i n HaBaD-HaGaT Atzilut be Katnut . Only one Sefira, Keter de Malchut, is above the Parsa , while the three lower Sefirot (NHY) of ZA and nine lower ZA a n d n i n e l o w e r ZA Se- firot of firot o f firot Malchut (from Malchut ( f r o m Malchut Hochma to Malchut de Malchut ) are under the Parsa . As was already stated, Malchut did not have its own Sefirot before TB ; it was just a point. Because of TB , Malchut rose and received all the Sefirot that are now below it (the lower third of Tifferet , Netzah , Hod and Yesod ), turning into an independent Partzuf . Then, these four Partzuf . Then, these f our Partzuf Sefirot are restructured into ten according to special laws. A Sefira is a certain property of the Creator that Malchut takes as firm and unchanging. The Sefira Da’at is a request that ZA and ZA a n d ZA Malchut raise to Bina in order to receive the Ohr Hochma . The Sefira Da’at has no constant place of its own; it constitutes the “desire to receive” Ohr Ho- chma , which Bina feels owing to the request of the ZON . As soon as ZA starts breaking up, its request to Bina gradually begins to subside: first, Sefira Keter is lost, then Sefira Keter i s l o s t , t h e n Sefira Keter Hochma etc., until the last one finally disappears. לעצמה וחיברה ביררה , שיצאה בעת , החדש ה \" דמ אלו פ \" מה וקומה קומה שכל , ותדע ( קכט לקח , עתיק פרצוף שיצא בעת הנה כי : נוקבא לבחינת לה שנעשה , דנקודים מהכלים חלק , שבהם ע \" הגו בחינת , דהיינו . כ \" שביה בעת שלמים שנשארו , דנקודים ר \" הג כל אליו וחיבר .( ו \" ע אות ) \" דפנים כלים \" הנקראים , קטנותם בעת שיצאו . עינים ונקבי ע \" גו שהם , מדרגה דכל העליונה מחציתה רק עמהם באו לא הנקודים שבקטנות , נבחן ולפיכך . התחתונה למדרגה ירדו , פ \" אח הנקראים , אחת דכל התחתונה ומחציתה ומחציתה , דכתר העליונה מחציתה את דנקודים מהכלים לו לקח החדש ה \" דמ עתיק שפרצוף נוקבא פרצוף לבחינת נעשו והם . דנקודים ר \" בג הכלולים ת \" דז השרשים ' וז , ב \" דחו העליונה .\" דאצילות דעתיק ן \" וב ה \" מ \" המכונים והם . בזה זה יחד ונתחברו . החדש ה \" דמ העתיק אל וסדר .( ט \" קי אות ) ן \" ב נקראים אליו שנתחברו דנקודים והכלים , ה \" מ נקרא דעתיק הזכר כי . באחוריו ן \" דב והעתיק בפנים ה \" דמ העתיק : א \" פו הוא עמידתם"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 390 129) You should know that as each level of the five Partzufim of MA Hadash emerged, it sorted out and added a certain part of the Kelim de Nikudim, which became like a Nukvah (that, which asks to be filled with the light) as regards this particular level. Therefore, Atik attached all the Gar de Nikudim that remained intact upon break- ing of the vessels, i.e., the GE, the upper halves of each level. Thus, the Partzuf Atik added to itself only the upper halves of Keter, Hoch- ma and Bina (Abba ve Ima), and the seven Ketarim of the seven lower Sefirot. All the parts added to Atik received the names MA and BON de Atik de Atzilut. MA is the giving part in Atik called Zachar (male essence). BON is the receiving part in Atik called Nekeva (female essence). With regard to one another, they are Panim (Atik de MA – Ma de Atik) and Achoraim (Atik de BON and BON de Atik). In general, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are built simi- larly. All the vessels of Atzilut that emerged from a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug Reshimot Aleph/Shoresh , i.e., its own Sefirot Keter , Hochma etc., form the right line of Atzilut, have light in them, and are called MA and Zachar . Each of these Sefirot (Partzufim) takes the broken, empty and elimi- nated vessels from the world of Nikudim and builds the left line out of them, which requires correction and filling with light. These vessels are called BON or BON or BON Nukvah . Thus, the world of Atzilut contains five pairs of Partzufim (actually, there are six of them; we will study that in detail in “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”).These are Atik and its Nukvah (Keter), Arich Anpin and its Nukvah (Hochma), Abba(Zachar) ve Ima (Nukvah) – the Partzuf Gar de Bina, Israel Saba (Zachar) ve Tvunah (Nukvah) (YESHSUT) – the Partzuf Zat de Bina, ZA and its Nukvah and also Malchut , for which the souls that re- quire correction play the role of Nukvah . Tvunah is a part of Bina , in which a root of the future Sefira (or Partzuf ) Partzuf ) Partzuf ZA emerges. In other words, this part of Bina can be called a womb. In Hebrew, it is called exactly so: “Rechem” . This is a place of a Zivug , conception, and birth."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 391 Atik , which has nothing to do with the breaking of the vessels, selects and attaches to itself the entire vessels of GE de Keter and GE de Keter and GE de Keter Abba ve Ima (left empty after the breaking) and commits itself to filling them with its light. The world of Atzilut is in fact Nikudim ; only it has a special system of protection against the breaking of the vessels. This system is based on the reception of small portions of light by large vessels. The Sefira, which was in the world of Nikudim, now turns into a whole Partzuf in Atzilut . The force of resistance to egoism will be a lot more powerful than this egoism. Any giving part of the Partzuf is called Partzuf is called Partzuf MA and the receiving – BON . However, in the world of AK, the Ohr Hochma shines in MA and BON , while in Atzilut – the Ohr Hassadim . The world of Atzilut is called giving, Zachar , the correcting and male part. Concerning Atzilut, the world of Nikudim is called Nekeva . It receives from and is corrected with the help of Atzilut . It is not the case that every upper vessel will be called giving, and the subsequent one receiving. For instance, Bina does not want to re- ceive anything, so is it MA or BON ? Only ZA and Malchut (Nukvah) may be called MA and BON . If the giver and the receiver face one another, they are both ready: the one to bestow, the other to receive the light. If we speak of transferring the light of Hassadim , the notions “right” and “left” arise, since Ohr Hassadim provides the breadth of spiritual at- tainment, not the height. Where there is an abundance of Ohr Hassadim, it is defined as “right”; where there is only a little of it, it is called “left”. דכתר התחתון חציו את אליו וחיבר בירר , חכמה בקומת שיצא , החדש ה \" דמ א \" א ופרצוף ( קל בחכמה דהיינו , הכתר שמתחת בהמדרגה היו הקטנות שבעת , דכתר פ \" האח שהם , הנקודים זה יחד ונתחברו . החדש ה \" דמ א \" הא אל נוקבא לבחינת ונעשה .( ז \" ע אות ) דנקודים ובינה שהיא , ן \" דב א \" וא , בימין עומד , הזכר שהוא , ה \" דמ א \" א : ושמאל ימין הוא עמידתם וסדר . בזה . בשמאל עומדת , הנוקבא מתוך עתיק כי , הוא , נקודים דכתר התחתון חציו את גם לקח לא ה \" דמ עתיק שפרצוף ומה ר \" דג דפנים הכלים רק אליו חיבר לא לכן , מאד גבוהה שמעלתו , דאצילות ' הא ראש שהוא שהם , התחתון הכתר בחצי כן שאין מה . השבירה בעת פגם שום אירע לא שבהם , דנקודים"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 392 בכתר ונתחברו ב \" מחו עלו הגדלות בעת כ \" ואח , ב \" בחו הקטנות בעת נפולים שהיו , פ \" אח , ונתבטלו דנקודים מהכתר ונפלו חזרו הכלים שבירת בעת כ \" אח אשר ,( ד \" פ אות ) דנקודים אותם לקח ולכן . לעתיק זה משום ראוים ואינם , וביטולם נפילתם עם נפגמו כבר המה הרי . ה \" דמ א \" א 130) The Partzuf Arich Anpin (the level of Hochma) sorted and at- tached to itself the lower half of the Keter de Nikudim, i.e., the AHP de Keter, which were on the lowest level (Hochma and Bina, Abba ve Ima) of the world of Nikudim. Arich Anpin turned these AHP into its Nukvah. MA (Zachar) de Arich Anpin is on the right, while its Nukvah (BON) is on the left. The Partzuf Atik did not attach the lower part (AHP) of the Keter de Nikudim to itself, since it corresponds to the first Rosh of the world of Nikudim, and its level is very high. Hence, only Gar de Keter and Gar de Abba ve Ima were attached to it, i.e., the vessels unspoiled during the breaking. This cannot be said about the AHP de Keter that fell to a lower level during Katnut and then returned to its place during Gadlut by merging with Keter. When the vessels broke, the AHP fell again and disappeared. Therefore, only Arich Anpin, but not Atik, can attach the AHP de Keter to itself. Only the light and the vessel exist; but there are countless variet- ies of their combinations and interactions. Only man who reached this level can clearly confirm or deny it. We know too little. It is just a fig- ment of our imagination. No Kabbalist ever made a point of describing everything. They wrote their books so that we could ascend and feel it for ourselves, and not just spend time reading thick bulky volumes. We can exist in our world, and then start researching nature, whereas in the spiritual world, we must first attain it and only then start living in it. Spirituality is attained through perception. התחתון חצים את להם וחיברו ביררו , בינה בקומת שהם , החדש ה \" דמ א \" או ופרצוף ( קלא כ \" אח אלא . דנקודים ת \" בהז נפולים היו הקטנות שבעת , ב \" דחו פ \" האח שהם , דנקודים ב \" דחו .( ד \" צ אות ) דנקודים ב \" לחו ונתחברו עלו , נקודים הגדלות בעת"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 393 א \" או להם ביררו ואותם .( ז \" ק אות ) ונתבטלו דנקודים ת \" להז ונפלו חזרו כ \" שביה בעת ואשר . ן \" דב דבינה ת \" וו דחכמה ת \" ז מכונים והם . אליהם נוקבא לבחינת ה \" דמ התחתון בחציה נשאר ולא . עתיק בפרצוף ן \" דב ב \" דחו ר \" הג עם נשארה דבינה החסד בחינת כי א \" דאו והנוקבא , ה \" דמ בינה קומת הוא א \" דאו הזכר ונמצא . ולמטה מגבורה ת \" ו אם כי דבינה . בשמאל ן \" דב א \" ואו , בימין ה \" דמ א \" או : ושמאל בימין הם ועמידתם . ן \" דב ב \" דחו ת \" ז היא . ן \" דב ב \" דחו המלכיות לקחו , א \" דאו ת \" הז שהם , ה \" דמ ת \" והישסו 131) The Partzuf Abba ve Ima de MA Hadash on the level of Bina sorted out and attached to itself the lower part of Partzuf Hochma- Bina of the world of Nikudim, i.e., their AHP, which were on the level of the Zat de Nikudim. Then, during the Gadlut de Nikudim, they rose to join GE de Abba ve Ima. However, as the vessels broke, these AHP fell to the Zat de Nikudim and disappeared. These broken vessels were sorted out by Abba ve Ima de MA Hadash (as Nukvah) and are now called Zat de Ho- chma and the six lower Sefirot (Vav Tachtonot) de Bina, as regards BON. Why are there six Sefirot in BON de Bina and not seven? It is because Hesed de Bina remained in Partzuf Atik together with Gar de Hochma and Bina de BON. Only the six lower Sefirot from Gevura to Malchut were left in the lower half of Bina. Thus, Bina de MA Hadash is considered Zachar de Abba ve Ima, while Zat of Hochma-Bina de BON is Nukvah de Abba ve Ima. The YESHSUT de MA, i.e., the Zat de Abba ve Ima, attached to itself Malchut of Hochma-Bina de BON. Here we learn how the Rashim de Nikudim were attached to the Rashim de Atzilut . The world of Nikudim was first in Katnut , then in Gad- lut , where its heads, Keter and Keter and Keter Abba ve Ima, attached their AHP and re- AHP and r e- AHP ceived the light of Gadlut . They passed it to GE de ZON , but some sparks of the light went under the Parsa . This led to a breaking of the vessels, their downfall and death. The Rashim de Nikudim lost the light of Gadlut and returned to Katnut , whereupon Atzilut emerged instead of Nikudim ."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 394 The purpose of the world of Atzilut is to correct the broken vessels, lift them up, absorb, and fill them with the light, while at the same time avoiding another breaking. The world of Atzilut is in fact similar to the world of Nikudim , but its mode of operation is correct. There can be no errors in Atzilut , because it has the Reshimot of the broken vessels and knows how to act to avoid repeating that state. The Partzuf Atik de Atzilut attached to itself the purest vessels: the upper part of Keter de Nikudim , the upper part of Abba ve Ima de Nikudim and Zat de Nikudim , i.e., the 7 roots (Ketarim) with the information of the future Guf de Nikudim . Arich Anpin takes upon itself to correct, attach and fill the AHP de Keter of the world of Nikudim of the world of Nik udim of the world of with light. The Partzuf Abba ve Ima is responsible for the correction and fill- ing of the AHP de Abba ve Ima de Nikudim with light. Abba ve Ima forms a combination of two Partzufim : Hochma and Bina. The Partzuf Hochma , i.e., Abba de Atzilut, attached the AHP de Abba de Nikudim , but Ima de Atzilut did not attach all the AHP de Ima de Nikudim (excluding Hesed ), since Hesed is a giving part of Bina and refers to the Rosh . While studying the interconnections between the corrected and uncorrected properties (vessels) in the world of Atzilut , we better under- stand what we will possess in the future. We learn what spiritual proper- ties we will be connected with and how, for our souls are actually the broken vessels. The attachment of the Kelim de Nikudim , which are to the left of the Kelim de Atzilut , speaks of the Ohr Hassadim that always spreads from right to left. The light of Hochma spreads downwards. From this, it becomes clear that the height of the Partzuf depends on the amount of the Ohr Hochma, while its capacity depends on the Ohr Hassadim (correc- tion). These parameters complement one another. The light of Hochma spreads only together with the light of Hassadim . הכלים את אליהם וחיברו ביררו , ונקודה ק \" ו בקומת שהם , החדש ה \" דמ ן \" זו ופרצוף ( קלב אות ) דנקודים ת \" הז של ע \" הגו בחינת דהיינו . ע \" בבי שבירתם מתוך , דנקודים ת \" דז דפנים"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 395 , בימין ה \" דמ ן \" הזו : ושמאל בימין הוא ועמידתם . ה \" דמ ן \" הזו אל לנוקבא נעשו והם .( ח \" ע . בשמאל ן \" דב ן \" והזו 132) The Partzuf ZON de MA Hadash, which has only the Sefirot ZA and Keter in Malchut, sorted out and attached to itself (as Nuk- vah) the GE de Zat de Nikudim, positioning them on the left, being itself on their right. The YESHSUT de MA (seven lower Sefirot de AVI) attached the Sefirot of Malchut (Behinot Hochma and Bina of Partzuf BON). The GE de Zat de Nikudim did not just disappear; they were broken with the vessels under Parsa . Consequently, they cannot be attached to the ZON de Atzilut the way the other Partzufim of MA Hadash attaches Nukvot from the world of Nikudim . The Kli of Zat de Nikudim must be corrected first by raising MAN and other consecutive actions. MAN and o ther consecutiv e actions. MAN There is only one vessel – the desire to receive pleasure, which later acquires the Creator’s properties, i.e., the 9 upper Sefirot , by using them to work with its egoism. As the egoism is gradually corrected, Malchut begins to approach differently the properties received from the Creator in its nine Sefirot . On each level, the combinations of the nine properties and Malchut are completely different from those of the previous level. The same is true about people. One differs from another by his character traits. We cannot even catch all the nuances of the differences in these traits, be that external appearance or inner content. It seems to us that the spiritual forces and objects are rather simple. There are ten parts, which in turn, consist of their own ten. That is all. However, we should understand why there is such a remarkable subdivision in the spiritual world, and what is in it for us. Above all, this multitude of desires must be united by one intention, imparting completeness and perfection to them: the intention for the sake of the Creator. Perfection in itself is very simple, impossible to divide. If it can be divided, it suggests some differences; and it cannot be called perfec-"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 396 tion. In spirituality, common intention leads to perfection. Until that happens, we are overwhelmed with a swarm of desires with all their con- nections, an awesome system of control and unpredictability. Ideally, it is only Malchut of the World of Infinity, completely filled with the light, that exists outside of us. In his manuscripts (which, by the way, are still unpublished, be- cause people are not yet ready for what they say), Baal HaSulam writes about extremely complicated interactions; he gives them special names and describes such levels of attainment that are not even mentioned in “The Study of the Ten Sefirot”. He can speak about these processes be- cause he himself was in a state of simple perfection. The higher your head (which sees the simplicity and wholeness of the entire system) is, the more minute the details you can distinguish, seeing the same perfection and simplicity in the general confusion. It resembles a scientist who sees the interconnections between all elements of the general picture as he penetrates deeper into his science. בעולם שיצאו , החדש ה \" דמ הקומות ' ה אשר . אצילות פ \" שבה ן \" וב ה \" המ נתבאר והנה ( קלג , נוקבא לבחינת להם ונתקנו , הנקודים בזמן ששימשו הישנים מהכלים להם ביררו , האצילות . ן \" ב בשם הנקראת ונתקנו נבררו א \" ואו א \" דא ן \" והב , דנקודים ר \" דג העליונה ממחציתן ונתקן נעשה דעתיק ן \" שהב ן \" והב , ונתבטלו וחזרו דנקודים גדלות בעת להם ששמשו , דנקודים ר \" דג התחתונה ממחציתן ונפלו נשברו הגדלות שבעת , דנקודים קטנות בעת שיצאו , דפנים מהכלים ונתקן נברר ן \" דזו . שלהם דאחורים הכלים עם ביחד 133) So, we know what MA and BON are in the 5 Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, where 5 levels of MA Hadash (Kelim de Atzilut) sorted out the old vessels of the world of Nikudim, selected the suit- able ones, and corrected them (using them as Nukvah called BON). Thus, MA de Atik corrected the upper part of Gar de Nikudim, and MA de Arich Anpin and Abba ve Ima sorted out and corrected the vessels of the lower half of Gar de Nikudim, which had been used during Gadlut de Nikudim and later broke, fell and disappeared."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 397 MA de ZON sorted out and corrected the vessels of GE de Zat of the world of Nikudim, which had also broken during Gadlut and disap- peared together with their AHP. Overall, 320 parts have been broken. The count is as follows: eight Melachim , each containing HaVaYaH – Yud-Key-Vav-Key with the 10 Se- firot inside. In all, there are 8x4x10=320. Out of these 320 parts, 32 Malchuyot are called “Lev haEven” (stone heart). The remaining 288 parts, called Rapach , refer to the first nine Sefirot . Each fragment of a broken vessel is a spark that remained from the screen of the Partzuf in its previous unspoiled state. Partzuf in its pr evious unspoiled s t at e. Partzuf There are GE de Keter and GE de Keter and GE de Keter GE de Abba ve Ima above the Parsa. The AHP de Abba ve Ima fell to the place of GE de ZON de Nikudim, while the broken vessels fell under the Parsa . In place of the world of Nikudim, there emerged the world of Atzilut with its five Partzufim . The entire Gar de Atzilut takes the Gar de Nikudim , corrects them and fills with the light of Gadlut . ZON de Atzilut correct GE de ZON of the world of GE de ZON of the w orld of GE de ZON Nikudim . Both the GE and the AHP de ZON break and fall under the Parsa . When the vessels break, all their fragments mix and penetrate one another. Why do the GE and the AHP interpenetrate during the break- AHP int er pene tr at e during the br eak - AHP ing of the vessels? Does the intention “to receive” unite them more than the intention “to bestow”? Prior to the breaking, the GE and the AHP possessed a common intention to bestow. Afterwards, in their uncor- rected state, the intention is again the same– to receive. Hence, the con- nection between them is also preserved after the breaking, despite the fact that each fragment feels separated from the others. However, the GE and the AHP do not make up a single whole anymore; therefore, the AHP do no t mak e up a single whole an ymor e; ther ef or e, the AHP connection between them (if it exists) is characterized only as inclusion. Thus, there are the four following kinds of broken vessels (left): 1. The GE (the vessels of bestowal); 2. The GE inside the AHP ; 3. The AHP inside the AHP inside the AHP GE ; 4. The AHP (the vessels of reception). AHP (the v essels of r ecep tion). AHP"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 398 The ZON de Atzilut take the vessels that refer to the GE . The AHP are the egoistic vessels that cannot be corrected yet and are called Lev haEven . There are two more kinds of vessels: the GE inside the AHP and the AHP inside the AHP inside the AHP GE . These vessels can somehow be corrected. The GE inside the AHP are the vessels of bestowal inside the vessels of recep- AHP ar e the v essels of bes t o w al inside the v essels of r ecep- AHP tion. This combination can be used for the formation of the worlds of BYA under the Parsa : Beria – GE in the Awzen (Bina), Yetzira – GE in the Hotem (ZA) and Assiya – GE in the Peh (Malchut) . These vessels are sorted out and born by Malchut of the world of Atzilut . With the help of the AHP inside the AHP inside the AHP GE, we can pass to Gadlut of the world of Atzilut . If Atzilut remains only in Katnut , it will not be able to correct anything under the Parsa , i.e., the vessels referring to the AHP de ZON of the world of de ZON of the w orld of de ZON Nikudim . It is precisely because the AHP are in- AHP ar e in- AHP side the GE of the broken vessels that they can be lifted above the Parsa and subjected to correction, by their use as vessels of bestowal. That is what man’s work is all about. A special Partzuf (common Partzuf ( c o m m o n Partzuf soul) Adam is created. The correction of this part depends on Adam’s cor- rection. However, this is not the topic of our research for the time being. The vessels of reception cannot be corrected when they exist separately. This can be done only when they are united with the vessels of bestowal. By way of an explosion, the Creator mixes these vessels, i.e., He actually mixes His own “desire to bestow” with the creation’s “desire to receive”. Now a part of the broken vessels will possess both the “desire to receive” and the “desire to bestow”, although each in its own proportion. That is what the breaking of the vessels, “the sin” of Adam and other fragmentations, were needed for."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 399 T H E U N C H A N G I N G S T A T E A N D T H E A S C E N T S O F T H E W O R L D S O F B Y A ובעליות שבקביעות המוחין בעניני גדול כלל שני אלפי בשתא הנוהגין , והעולמות הפרצופים הנקודות ' ג בסוד , סדרים ' בג באו דנקודים ת \" וז ר \" הג של הגדלות שיציאת , נתבאר כבר ( קלד המוחין לקבלת ס \" הע השלמת של מינים ' ב שיש תבין ומשם .( ו \" פ אות ) חירק שורק חולם : דגדלות דרך חדש האור את האירו ק \" דא ן \" שהזו בעת דהיינו . בעליון והתכללותו עליתו מצד הוא . א פ \" האח נתעלו שבזה , שלו להפה דכתר עינים מנקבי ת \" הה והורידו , דנקודים הכתר אל הטבור . שלו ס \" הע והשלימו לכתר למדרגתם וחזרו , א \" באו שהיו דכתר הנפולים א \" או גם ונמצאים . דכתר פ \" האח על דבוקים שהיו , א \" דאו ע \" גו גם עמהם שעלו אז נבחן הנה ונבחן .( ג \" צ אות ) כמוהו נעשה לעליון העולה התחתון כי , הכתר של השלמות ס \" בהע נכללים התכללותם מכח , שלהם ס \" ע להשלמת להם החסרים פ \" האח השיגו א \" או שגם , זה משום . דגדלות מוחין של ' הא מין וזהו . בהכתר Having failed to receive all the light at one go, the world of Niku- dim could not exist, so the light was left above the Parsa in the world of Atzilut , while correction of the broken vessels continues above the Parsa . The total amount of light above the Parsa divides into 6000 parts; each of them must go through 6000 levels or corrections. It resembles a huge column consisting of 6000 people (called one generation). Each genera- tion must climb all 6000 steps. The world of Atzilut corrects the vessels only up to the Ateret haYe- sod , i.e., the vessels of Malchut, while the Zat de Yesod receives no light. Hence, due to the inverse relation between the lights and the vessels, only the following lights can enter the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut : Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, and Vak de Haya . The lights Yechida and Gar de Haya do not enter the Partzuf . This means that we use only the vessels Partzuf . This means that w e use only the v essels Partzuf of GE (with lights Nefesh and Ruach inside), while of AHP, only their inclusion in the GE (with the lights Neshama and Gar de Haya ) is used. Atzilut conditions the correction in this way, so that the law of TB would never be violated. Real AHP cannot be worked with; it is impossible to AHP canno t be w or k ed with; it is im possible t o AHP"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 400 fill them with light. The only opportunity is to lift them to GE , i.e., work only with those AHP that are able to become similar to AHP that ar e able t o become similar t o AHP GE . Each fragment that feels the desire to be corrected consists of 10 Sefirot or four Behinot . Keter , Hochma and Gar de Bina can be corrected and filled with light, but Zat de Bina , ZA and Malchut cannot. Only a very small part of the desires that receives an insignificant amount of light is corrected. This continues until the Mashiach comes; then the entire AHP rise to the world of Atzilut and are filled with the light, which means the Gmar Tikkun . 134) We already know that the transition to Gadlut took place in three stages: 1) Holam (a point above the letter), 2) Shuruk (a point inside the letter) and 3) Hirik (a point under the letter). According to this, now let us examine two kinds of supplementations of the 10 Sefirot with the subsequent reception of the Mochin de Gadlut. The first kind of supplementation occurs because of the rise of the Partzuf by way of its inclusion into the upper one. For example, when ZON de AK pass the new light to Keter de Nikudim through the Tabur and lower Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de Keter to its Peh, this leads to the rise of AHP de Keter from the Rosh de Abba ve Ima, which create 10 complete Sefirot in Keter. The GE de Abba ve Ima rose together with AHP de Keter and joined the 10 complete Sefirot de Keter, since the lower object rising to the level of the upper becomes equal to it. Hence, it is assumed that when the AHP de Keter rose, Abba ve Ima also received the AHP for the completion of 10 Sefirot by including them in Keter. Keter acquires its own Keter acq uir es its o wn Keter AHP , completes its Partzuf to 10 Partzuf t o 1 0 Partzuf Sefirot, and receives the light of Mochin de Gadlut. So what AHP is received by AHP is r eceiv ed b y AHP GE de Abba ve Ima ? It is definitely not their own AHP . The rise of one’s own AHP requires a lot more power, since each lower object is worse off than AHP r eq uir es a lo t mor e po w er , since eac h lo w er object is w or se of f than AHP the one above it. Keter received the light according to its anti-egoistic Keter r eceiv ed the light accor ding t o its anti-egois tic Keter force. The rise of the AHP de Abba ve Ima requires a more powerful light"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 401 than that which lifted the AHP de Keter ; therefore, the GE de Abba ve Ima take the AHP de Keter . There is no quantitative division in the spiritual world; one can re- ceive as much as one wants. The division is qualitative. Keter and Keter a n d Keter Abba ve Ima passed to the state of Gadlut with the help of the same Gadlut w i t h t h e h e l p o f t h e s a m e Gadlut AHP de Keter .Supple- menting Abba ve Ima to 10 Sefirot is called the First Supplementation. Sefirot i s c a l l e d t h e F i r s t S u p p l e m e n t a t i o n . Sefirot When man reaches the next level, it means that he equals its mea- sure of correction, but not by his personal properties, “chromosomes”. In other words, two people on the same level merge into one new vessel according to the measure of their altruistic intention. Only the extent of correction unites people on the same level and makes them equal to it. The light that descends from above for correcting a certain Partzuf does not have enough power to correct the one below it, because it is more egoistic; hence, its correction requires more power. The light AB- SAG allows the vessel to feel the Creator’s greatness and become like Him, i.e., to start doing altruistic actions. Keter of the world of Keter of the w orld of Keter Nikudim gains this power, but GE de Abba ve Ima receive light from AHP de Keter, along with the opportunity to rise to Keter, together with them. However, this is the level of AHP de Keter , whereas AHP de Abba ve Ima remains in its place so far. Meanwhile, GE de Abba ve Ima also rise, at the same time staying in their place, since nothing disappears in the spiritual worlds. Hence, GE de Abba ve Ima , which rose similarly as GE de Keter, also receive a new state with the help of AHP de Keter. If something changes in Atzilut , this world and the worlds BYA simultaneously move up one or more levels. Similarly, they can also de- scend, but not lower than their constant state of Katnut . There are three states in Gadlut : the use of Bet de Aviut (Awzen), Gimel de Aviut (Hotem), and Dalet de Aviut (Peh). The three ascents of the worlds ABYA take place in compliance with these three states of Gadlut ."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 402 In the state of Katnut, the vessels work only with GE , but not with AHP ; hence, the latter are hidden inside of the GE located below. The light AB-SAG comes from above and gives the Partzuf Keter power to lift Partzuf Keter po w er t o lif t Partzuf Keter and attach its own AHP , which fell into the GE de Abba ve Ima . This pro- cess is called AHP de Aliyah ( AHP ( AHP ( of Elevation). The AHP of Elevation). The AHP GE de Abba ve Ima is partially filled at the expense of AHP de Keter ; to be completely filled, they must use their own AHP . האירו ק \" דא ן \" שהזו בעת דהיינו . עצמה בכחה ס \" בע נשלמת שהמדרגה , הוא ' הב ומין ( קלה עינים מנקבי ת \" הה והוריד , א \" לאו ,\" השורק נקודת \" הנקרא , ק \" דא היסוד דרך חדש האור את אל ת \" בז נפילתם ממקום א \" דאו פ \" דאח הכלים את העלה שבזה , שלהם להפה עצמם א \" דאו . עצמם י \" ע א \" או נשלמים שעתה , ס \" הע להם והשלימו , א \" דאו הראש שלמותם שקבלו בעת ,' הא במין כ \" משא . להם החסרים ממש פ \" דאח הכלים השיגו עתה כי התכללותם י \" ע אלא . פ \" אח חסרים עוד היו באמת הרי , שלו פ \" באח הדבקות י \" ע מהכתר , הכתר במקום בעודם ס \" בע להשלימם רק שהספיק , שלהם פ \" מאח הארה ידו על קבלו , בכתר . עצמם למקומם משם יציאתם בעת כלל ולא 135) The Second Supplement of the Partzuf to 10 Sefirot consists in the fact that a certain level acquires its 10 Sefirot by its own strength. This happens when the new light shines through Yesod of the world of AK (called Nekuda de Shuruk – a point inside the letter). This luminescence was destined for Abba ve Ima de Nikudim. As- sisted by it, Malchut descended from the Nikvey Eynaim to the Peh de Abba ve Ima and elevated its AHP from GE de ZON to Rosh de Abba ve Ima, which completed the vessels of Abba ve Ima to 10 Sefirot by their own strength, i.e., with the help of their own AHP. In the first case, the completion to the 10 Sefirot were at the ex- pense of the connection between GE de Abba ve Ima and the AHP de Keter that waspreserved during their ascent and attachment to Keter. In the second case, it happened with their own AHP in their own place. . א \" דאו פ \" אח ועלית השורק הארת בעת . א : ת \" בז גם השלמות מיני ' ב נמצא ז \" ועד ( קלו פ \" אח בחינת שם וקבלו . א \" לאו ועלו עמהם יחד נתעלו בהם הדבוקים ת \" דז ע \" הגו גם שאז"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 403 , פ \" אח הארת רק אלא , שלהם הממשיים פ \" אח עוד אינם אלו פ \" שאח . שלהם ס \" הע להשלמת . עצמם למקומם בירידתם כלל ולא , א \" באו בעודם ס \" ע להשלמת המספיק גם הורידו ז \" שעי . ת \" הז אל א \" מאו המוחין התפשטות בעת ת \" הז שהשיגו , ס \" הע השלמת . ב שלהם י \" התנה את והעלו , ק \" א רגלי סיום מקום אל שלהם מהחזה המסיימת ת \" ה בחינת הם שלמות ס \" בע נשלמים היו , ומתו נשברו לולא , שאז . לאצילות למדרגתם אותם וחיברו , ע \" מבי . להם החסרים הממשיים פ \" האח את השיגו עתה כי . עצמם י \" ע 136) Similarly, there are two methods of supplementing the Zat de Nikudim to 10 Sefirot. The first is with the help of luminescence through Shuruk and elevation of AHP de Abba ve Ima to GE de Abba ve Ima. This is accompanied by the rise of GE de Zat, with their subsequent reception of AHP de Abba ve Ima for supplement- ing their Sefirot to 10. These AHP de Abba ve Ima are not real AHP de Zat de Nikudim, and their insignificant luminescence is sufficient only for supplementing the Sefirot de Zat to 10 in the place of Abba ve Ima (i.e., one level higher), and not in their own location. The second method consists in the fact that the light from Abba ve Ima reaches the Zat, which start lowering their screen from the Chazeh to the Sium de AK, and elevate their Tifferet-Netzah-Hod- Yesod from the BYA in order to attach them to their GE. Had there been no breaking of the vessels, they would have had to supplement the GE de Zat to 10 Sefirot by their own strength, i.e., with the help of their actual AHP, whereupon the entire process of filling Malchut de Ein Sof with the light would have been done. As soon as ZON wished to supplement itself to 10 ZON w i s h e d t o s u p p l e m e n t i t s e l f t o 1 0 ZON Sefirot , the vessels broke. Later on, we will study how the AHP will attach to their AHP w i l l a t t a c h t o t h e i r AHP GE in the world of Atzilut in order to avoid a new breaking. In Atzilut, this method will prevent independent attachment of the AHP , i.e., the second meth- od of supplementation that led to the breaking must be abolished. Keter is just the 10 Keter is jus t the 1 0 Keter Sefirot . Abba ve Ima consist of two parts: Abba (the upper part, Panim , able to receive the light) and Ima , which is Acho- raim as regards Abba and receives light only on a request from ZON . Then it turns its face to Abba , accepts the light from it and passes it to"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 404 ZON . Both Abba and Ima have GE and AHP , but Abba is above Ima , so its GE and AHP are filled and supplemented by AHP ar e f illed and supplement ed b y AHP Keter . The GE and AHP de Ima may receive only because of the MAN raised by MAN r aised b y MAN ZON . The light that Gadlut gives to Keter also elevates Keter also elevat es Keter Abba , leaving Ima below. Thus, we may say that Abba is the GE of their common Partzuf , and Partzuf , and Partzuf Ima is their common AHP . Distinctions and definitions are applied according to what we wish to emphasize. Therefore, we have learned about two kinds of supplementation to 10 Sefirot . For example, Abba ve Ima can receive Gadlut with the help of the AHP de Keter , i.e., through the rise of GE de Ima to Keter , or while remaining in its place, be supplemented with the help of their own AHP . The same would have been the case with ZON de Nikudim had their ves- sels not been broken. ת \" מהישסו שיצאו , הפרצופים ' בד וכן , ת \" דחג לכלים א \" מאו שיצאו , פרצופים ' בד וגם ( קלז מבחינה כי . ס \" הע השלמות מיני ' ב אלו נמצאים בהם גם הנה ,( ט \" ז-ק \" ק אות ) מ \" דתנהי לכלים שהיא , בראש בעודם ת \" וישסו א \" דאו פ \" באח התדבקותם י \" ע מהם אחד כל נשלם היה אחת דמין ס \" הע בהשלמת להשתלם רוצים היו , ע \" לבי שנתפשטו כ \" ואח .' הא דמין ס \" ע השלמת . פרטיות בפרטי גם נוהג זה וענין .' הב 137) As with the Rashim, there are two kinds of supplementation to 10 Sefirot in the 4 Partzufim (Melachim) that emerge from Rosh de Abba ve Ima (Reshimot Dalet/Gimel). They are called Da’at, Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet.The same is true for the four Partzufim that emerge from the Rosh de YESHSUT (Reshimot Gimel/Bet) that replaced Abba ve Ima. They are Tifferet, Netzah-Hod, Yesod and Malchut. On the one hand, the 10 Sefirot de Guf are supplemented at the expense of the AHP of their Rashim, rising to where the Rashim are. On the other hand, they spread in the BYA wishing to be increased to 10 Sefirot by way of attaching their own AHP, i.e., using the second method. This rule is also effective in each individual case."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 405 The division of the Partzuf into Partzuf int o Partzuf GE and AHP is purely qualitative AHP is pur ely q ualit ativ e AHP and means that only the vessels of bestowal may be worked with, while the vessels of reception stay inactive. Now the AHP of the upper object AHP of the upper object AHP are not in GE of the lower as before. They are located exactly under their own GE , but remain idle. They can transfer the light downward. Creation, designed in this way, cannot change its structure or location. It can change only the intention, the way it will work with its parts. מיעוט שום ואין בקביעות שנתקנו , ן \" וזו א \" ואו א \" וא עתיק , אצילות פ \" ה אלו כי , ותדע ( קלח , בינה בקומת א \" ואו , חכמה בקומת א \" וא , כתר בקומת יצא שעתיק ,( ו \" קכ אות ) בהם נוהג . ראש בלי ק \" ו , א \" ז בקומת ן \" וזו והיינו .' הא דמין ס \" ע השלמת מבחינת היו , הגדלות מעת להם שנתבררו , פ \" דאח הכלים הנה והשיגו הכתר ידי על א \" או גם נשלמו שאז . דנקודים בכתר שהאיר , החולם נקודת דרך על ס \" ע א \" ואו א \" וא מעתיק אחד לכל שהיה פ \" אע ולפיכך .( ד \" קל אות ) פ \" דאח כלים הארת לו היה לא עתיק פרצוף ואפילו . שלהם לגופים ר \" ג בחינת מזה הגיע לא מ \" מ , בראש שלמות . א \" ואו א \" א וכן . ראש בלי ק \" ו בחינת אלא בגוף שהוא ,' הא דמין ס \" ע השלמת רק בהם נברר לא כ \" וע . תחילה נברר הזך כל כי , הוא והטעם אבל . בראש ס \" הע להשלים המספיק , פ \" דאח כלים הארת בחינת דהיינו . בעליון עליתו מצד להם מספיק היה , דנקודים בכתר נכללו א \" שאו בעת כי . לגוף מהראש התפשטות עוד אין ולמטה דנקודים דכתר מפה , עצמם למקומם בהתפשטותם כלל ולא , הכתר מכח פ \" אח הארת שהם , עצמם ן \" הזו ש \" מכ , ראש בלי ק \" בו היו א \" ואו א \" וא דעתיק שהגופים וכיון .( ה \" קל אות ) . ראש בלי ק \" בו שיצאו , דאצילות הכולל גוף בחינת 138) You must know that the 5 Partzufim of the world Atzilut: Atik, Arich Anpin, Abba ve Ima and ZON, have their minimal state below which they cannot descend. Atik has the level of Keter, Arich Anpin – of Hochma, Abba ve Ima – of Bina and ZON – of ZA. The AHP that joined them during Gadlut supplemented their Se- firot to 10 through the point of Holam, which shone upon Keter de Nikudim. The GE de Abba ve Ima rose together with the AHP de Keter and received the same luminescence. Despite the fact that the Rashim of Atik, Arich Anpin, and Abba ve Ima have the full 10 Sefirot, they did not receive the lights that correspond to the Gar"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 406 in their Gufim. Even the Guf de Atik had the level of the Vak like Gufim de Arich Anpin and Abba ve Ima. It is known that the purer Partzufim are corrected first; consequently, they were corrected only according to the first method when the AHP rose to their GE and supplemented them to 10 Sefirot in the Rosh. However, the light has not yet spread from the Rosh into the Guf. Therefore, Abba ve Ima rose to Keter and received the light of AHP de Keter. This light, though, was insufficient for shining upon their own AHP, which remain below. Since the bodies of Atik, Arich An- pin, and Abba ve Ima have only the level of Vak, the ZON de Atzi- lut (its body) also has the same level. No Guf of the Guf of the Guf Partzuf in the world of Partzuf in the w orld of Partzuf Atzilut receives Gadlut . They stay in Katnut , while only the Rosh of each Partzuf receives Partzuf r eceiv es Partzuf Gadlut . In the world of Atzilut, Gadlut can be received only when the lower Partzuf rises to the upper. All ascents of the worlds on holidays, Sab- Partzuf rises t o the upper . All ascents of the w orlds on holida y s, Sab- Partzuf baths and the new moons are based on this principle, which prevents the breaking of the vessels. כ \" ג נתפשט , ק \" א דפרצופי בהראשים שיצא הכמות כל אלא . כן היה לא ק \" בא אמנם ( קלט הם כ \" וע . ק \" א דפרצופי ק \" ו בחינת רק שהם , אצילות פ \" ה כל נבחנים ולפיכך . שלהם לגופים הן ר \" שג , ר \" ג בחוסר . ה \" מ שהוא , א \" ז קומת דהיינו . ק \" א פ \" דה ה \" מ או החדש ה \" מ מכונים שגם וכיון , ולמטה מפה הגוף אל התפשטותה פ \" ע נבחנת המדרגה עיקר כי . ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא לבחינת נבחנים הם כ \" ע , ראש בלי ק \" ו רק לגוף התפשטות מהם אין הראשונים פרצופים ' לג . ק \" א פ \" ה אל ראש בלי ק \" ו קומת שהוא , ה \" מ 139) In the world of AK, the picture was different. The amount of the light in the Rosh spread to the Guf. In the world of Atzilut, the light that spread in the Rosh, even in the state of Gadlut, does not spread to the Guf. Hence, the world of Atzilut, as regards the world of AK, is defined as Vak (ZA) and is called MA Hadash or MA of the 5 Partzufim de AK, i.e., the level of ZA, which constitutes MA without Gar."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 407 It is similar to the state of the Partzufim of the world of AK , provided each of them will have only the Vak without the Gar . Let us examine it in more detail. Each Partzuf de AK , i.e., Galgalta , AB , SAG , MA and MA a n d MA BON ( Keter , Hochma , Bina , ZA and ZA a n d ZA Malchut ) in turn, consists of Gar ( Gar ( Gar Galgalta – Keter , AB – Hochma and SAG - Bina ) and Vak – MA and MA a n d MA BON . So, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut correspond only to MA de AK . Atik de Atzilut equals MA de Galgalta , Arich Anpin – the MA de AB, Abba ve Ima – the MA de SAG and the ZON – MA and ZON – MA a n d ZON – MA BON de AK . There is no spread- ing of light in the Guf , i.e., all of these Guf , i . e . , a l l o f t h e s e Guf Partzufim are in the state of Vak . הכתר לפרצוף ק \" ו לבחינת נבחן , כתר קומת בראש לו שיש , דאצילות שעתיק , באופן ( קמ נבחן , חכמה קומת בראש לו שיש , דאצילות א \" וא . ק \" א דכתר יחידה חיה נשמה וחסר . ק \" דא . ק \" דא ב \" דע יחידה חיה נשמה וחסר . חכמה שהיא ק \" דא ב \" ע לפרצוף ק \" ו לבחינת . ק \" דא ג \" ס פרצוף של ק \" ו לבחינת נבחנים , בינה קומה בראש להם שיש , דאצילות א \" ואו ן \" וב ה \" מ דפרצוף ק \" ו לבחינת נבחנים דאצילות ן \" והזו . ק \" דא ג \" דס יחידה חיה נשמה לו וחסר :' א במדרגה תמיד הם ן \" וזו ת \" וישסו . ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" דמ יחידה חיה נשמה להם וחסר . ק \" דא . גוף וזה ראש זה 140) Rosh de Atik of the world of Atzilut has the level of Keter, which is defined as Vak (MA) with regard to Partzuf Galgalta de AK. It has only the lights Ruach and Nefesh, while Neshama, Haya, and Yechida de Galgalta are absent. The Rosh de Arich Anpin, with the light of Hochma, corresponds to Vak (MA) de AB and has the lights Nefesh and Ruach, while Neshama, Haya and Yechida de Hochma de AB are absent. Abba ve Ima de Atzilut, whose Rosh has the light of Bina, is defined as Vak de SAG without the lights of Neshama, Haya and Yechida de Bina de SAG. The Partzuf ZON de Atzilut, which has the level of ZA and Malchut in its Rosh, is defined as the Vak of the Partzufim MA and BON de AK, without the lights of Neshama, Haya and Yechida de MA and BON de AK. דמין ס \" דע פ \" האח השלמת נבררים , התחתונים של טובים ממעשים ן \" מ העלאת י \" וע ( קמא עצמם א \" או שאז . השורק נקודת בחינת דרך על , עצמם מבחינת א \" דאו השלמתם דהיינו .' הב"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 408 גם כח להם יש שאז . שלהם פ \" האח אליהם ומעלים , שלהם עינים מנקבי ת \" הה מורידים הדבוקים , ן \" דזו ע \" הגו כי . למטה ממעלה הגופים אל דהיינו . ן \" זו שהם , ת \" הז אל להשפיע .( ד \" צ אות ) ס \" ע השלמת מהם ומקבלים א \" לאו עמהם נמשכים , א \" ואו פ \" באח פ \" האח עם ביחד אליהם שעלו , ן \" לזו כ \" ג מושפעים א \" באו שישנם המוחין כמות כל נמצא ואז ' דג להגופים גם ר \" ג יש אז ,' הב דמין זו השלמה מקבלים אצילות פ \" שה בעת , ולפיכך . שלהם הכולל גוף שהם , דאצילות ן \" להזו וכן . דאצילות א \" ואו א \" וא עתיק שהם , הראשונים פרצופים . דאצילות הגופים אל גם ר \" הג התפשטות בעת כי . ק \" א פ \" לה ומלבישים אצילות פרצופי ' ה עולים ואז כתר לפרצוף ומלביש עולה דאצילות ועתיק . ק \" א פ \" ה עם משתוים הם הרי , אצילות פ \" דה . ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" למ ן \" וזו , ק \" דא ג \" לס א \" ואו , ק \" דא ב \" לע א \" וא , ק \" דא . ק \" בא שכנגדו מהבחינה יחידה חיה נשמה מהם אחד כל מקבל ואז 141) The souls in the worlds BYA raise MAN, thus causing the de- scent of additional light This leads to a supplementing of the Partzu- fim to 10 Sefirot according to the second method wherein the light comes through NHY de Galgalta to the ZON de Nikudim (and Atzilut), via the point of Shuruk. Abba ve Ima lowers its Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim to Peh and elevates their AHP. GE de ZON (merged with the AHP de Abba ve Ima) rise to Abba ve Ima together with the AHP, and increase to 10 Sefirot. Then the entire amount of Mochin (the light) in Abba ve Ima affects the ZON, which rise together with the AHP de Abba ve Ima. Since the five Partzufim de Atzilut are supplemented according to the sec- ond method, the three first Partzufim have the lights of Gar in their Gufim as well as in the ZON, which makes up the common Guf of the world of Atzilut. Then the five Partzufim of the world of Atzilut rise and dress upon the five Partzufim de AK, since the spreading of Gar in the Gufim de Atzilut equates them with the five Partzufim de AK.This is so that Atik might rise and dress upon the Partzuf Keter de AK (Gal- galta), the Arich Anpin – on AB de AK, Abba ve Ima – on SAG de AK, and ZON – on MA and BON de AK."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 409 Such a dressing of the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut onto the corresponding Partzufim of the world of AK means that each of them AK means that eac h of them AK receives the lights Neshama, Haya and Yechida on the level of the world of AK . After the vessels break, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut emerge in Katnut, both in the Rosh and in the Guf . The first Guf . The f ir s t Guf Partzuf, Atik, is born. The Reshimot of Arich Anpin begin to appear in it; it later emerges from Atik . Thus, Atik does not fully enter Gadlut , but only to the extent of being able to give birth to Arich Anpin . In this way, all the Partzufim of Atzilut and the worlds BYA emerge. Then the light of Holam on the Reshimot Dalet/Gimel descends from above. As in the world of Nikudim , this light enters Keter , which attaches its AHP and AHP and AHP Abba ve Ima to itself, etc. This is the first case when all the Rashim receive Gadlut , while all the Gufim remain in Katnut . The second way of receiving Gadlut requires awakening from be- low, desire. In the world of Nikudim, the desire was received from NHY de Galgalta . The light shone upon them, and the ZON de Nikudim began asking for light from Abba ve Ima . True requests to Abba ve Ima in the world of Atzilut cause all the Partzufim to pass to Gadlut, according to the second method. If the Rashim de Atzilut receive Gadlut through the first method, why does this light not pass to the Gufim ? The reason lies in the fact that Gadlut of the Rashim does not happen at their own expense; rather, they are elevated by the higher Partzufim and lifted with their light. The Rosh did not rise to a higher level by its own strength. Neither was it filled by its own effort. Hence, upon receiving Gadlut , it also remained in Katnut, in its place below. It can in no way pass the light to its Guf below. All the Guf belo w . All the Guf Rashim de Atzilut received this kind of Gadlut . The second state of Gadlut in the Gufim occurs when the lower Partzufim ask the upper for strength to make a Zivug and pass to Zivug and pass t o Zivug Gadlut in their own places, without rising; consequently, they can spread the light to their bodies."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 410 Spiritual states do not disappear. Everything depends on what you wish to see at a particular moment and upon one's point of view. We are now interested in the specific states, first according to the initial method ( Gadlut Rashim ), then – to the second ( Gadlut Gufim ). Before the vessels were broken, we spoke about the Bitush Pnim u Makif . After the breaking, we do not speak about it anymore, since the Makif . Af t er the br eaking, w e do no t speak about it an ymor e, since the Makif vessels start to be corrected, acquire a screen. Next, they are filled with light from below. From our various desires, we take the smallest, the least egoistic, the one we can correct most easily, and fill it with light in accordance with its correction. Now, the light that comes to the vessel is no more than it can re- ceive. In the world of AK, a Zivug on the entire Zivug on the entir e Zivug TA was made, and it was possible to withstand the light of Infinity pressing the vessel to receive the light. After the break, it is no longer possible to withstand even a gram of light. It is only upon acquiring the tiniest screen that we can receive the light according to its strength. כי . ס \" הע דהשלמת ' הא מין לבחינת רק הללו המוחין נבחנים דאצילות ן \" הזו כלפי אמנם ( קמב שהם בעת הוא , א \" או י \" ע מקבלים שהם , פ \" האח הארת רק , גמורים פ \" אח אינם פ \" האח אלו אות ) שלהם פ \" האח חסרים עוד הם הרי , עצמם למקומם בהתפשטותם אבל . א \" או במקום כי .\" דעליה מוחין \" בשם שני אלפי בשתא משיג ן \" שהזו המוחין כל נבחנים זה ומטעם .( ו \" קל אמנם . ידם על נשלמים אז כי . ר \" ג למקום עלותם בעת רק , ר \" דג מוחין להשיג להם אפשר אי ן \" לזו נבררו לא עדיין כי . מוחין להם להיות אפשר אי , ר \" הג למקום למעלה עולים אינם אם . התיקון בגמר זולת יהיה לא שזה ,' הב דמין המוחין בחינת 142) The ZON de Atzilut receives light according to the first princi- ple, that is to say, through “AHP de Aliyah”. These AHP are not yet final. The light they receive is just the luminescence coming through Abba ve Ima, when ZON is on their level. However, on their own level, they do not have the AHP, so the light received by the ZON during 6000 years is called Mochin de Aliyah, for the light of Gar can be attained only while being on the level of the Gar, which in- crease them to 10 Sefirot. Until they reach the level of Gar, the ZON are unable to receive the entire light. However, the ZON have not yet"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 411 received their correction of the second kind. This will happen only in the Gmar Tikkun. When the ZON rise to ZON rise t o ZON Abba ve Ima , they compel them to make a Zivug and to receive light. The request of Zivug and t o r eceiv e light. The r eq ues t of Zivug ZON is made for the compre- ZON is made f or the com pr e- ZON hensively selected desires that are now unfit. It is necessary to find out whether they can be corrected. To that end, there is a special mechanism in the Rosh de Arich Anpin , through which it rules over Abba ve Ima , which in turn control ZON . The light that Arich Anpin sends down allows seeing fallaciousness only in nine Sefirot , but not in the 10-th, Malchut . Hence, the light of Arich Anpin is less powerful than it is supposed to be, but it provides an opportunity to correct the vessels of reception, which rise and join the vessels of bestowal.

They supplement their Sefirot to ten by using the first method. In the world of Nikudim, this light is called “luminescence through the Tabur” or"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 412 “Nekudat Holam”. Thus, no light de Gar spreads from the heads of Atik, Arich Anpin and Abba ve Ima, to their bodies and to ZON, for in the past, the Zat de Nikudim did not receive anything from this luminescence. The Mochin (the light) received during 6000 years until the Final Correction comes as an answer to the request – MAN – raised by the lower Partzufim, including the souls in the worlds BYA, i.e., by the second method. In the world of Nikudim, it is called “luminescence through Yesod” or “Nekudat Shuruk”. According to this method, Abba ve Ima elevate their own AHP,and merge with GE de Zat, which receive the light Mochin de Gar on the level of Abba ve Ima. In this way, Mochin spread to the Gufim of the five Partzufim de Atzilut, including ZON, but on the condition that they will be above, in the place of Gar. In the future, after the Gmar Tikkun, ZON will be increased to 10 Sefirot according to the second method, and Malchut will descend from the Parsa to the Sium Raglin de AK. Then Netzah, Hod and Yesod de ZON in the BYA will join ZON de Atzilut, while the Sium de Atzilut will have the same properties as Sium de AK. At that period, the Melech-haMashiach will come and “His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives”. Then it will be clear that the complete correction of the worlds during 6000 years can happen only through their ascent."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 413 T H E W O R L D S O F B E R I A , Y E T Z I R A A N D A S S I Y A ועשיה יצירה בריאה העולמות ' ג ביאור : ע \" בי העולמות ' בג להבחין יש כוללים עיקרים ' ז ( קמד . הללו העולמות ' לג המקום נעשה מהיכן . א מהנוקבא ויצאו שנאצלו בעת , בראשונה העולמות ועמידת ע \" בי פרצופי קומת שיעורי . ב . דאצילות . ר \" אדה של חטאו מטרם שהשיגו , עמידתם ומצב דתוספת מהמוחין קומה שיעורי אלו כל . ג של בחטאו שנפגמו לאחר העולמות נפילת ומקום , ע \" בי בפרצופי שנשתיירו המוחין . ד . ר \" אדה . דאצילות מפרסא למטה נפילתם אחר ע \" בי פרצופי שקבלו , דאמא המוחין . ה לבחינת להם ונעשו ע \" בי בפרצופי ונתלבשו שירדו , אצילות פ \" דה האחור פרצופי בחינת . ו . לנשמה נשמה . ע \" בי לפרצופי עתיק בחינת ונעשית שירדה , דאצילות המלכות בחינת . ז 144) We must learn seven interrelated fundamentals about the worlds of BYA: 1. Where the place for the three worlds come from. 2. The level of the Partzufim of BYA and the initial position of the worlds at the time of their formation and separation from Nukvah de Atzilut. 3. The ascents of the worlds and their positions before the sin of Adam haRishon. 4. The Mochin that the worlds of BYA received, and the place of their fall after they were broken due to the sin of Adam haRishon. 5. The Mochin, the light of Gadlut from Ima de Atzilut received by the worlds of BYA after they fell under the Parsa de Atzilut."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 414 6. The meaning of the back parts of the five Partzufim de Atzilut that fell under the Parsa into the worlds of BYA and became as Neshama de Neshama for them. 7. The level of Malchut de Atzilut that fell into the worlds of BYA and plays the role of Atik for the Partzufim de BYA. We have learned that the source of all, the Creator, cannot be at- tained by us. He thought to bestow delight upon the future creations. The light (the thought of creation and bestowal) emanates from Him and builds a vessel that will “desire to receive” His delight. All of creation’s desires correspond to the thought (the light) that emanates from the Creator. If that vessel were filled with the light, it would achieve the state of perfection. However, there is only one perfec- tion – the Creator; thus creation has to reach His level independently. For that purpose, the creation must be put into the Creator’s posi- tion; it should start creating something out of nothing. It must make the Creator out of itself. This is achieved by ascending the levels. Such work includes several requirements: 1. The advancement of creation by means of the descending lad- der of the worlds and the Partzufim . 2. The arrangement of necessary conditions for the creation, which is thoroughly detached from the Creator, so that it might ascend the “steps-levels” prepared in advance. We have learned about the formation of the steps from above: the structure of the world of AK , Nikudim, and then Atzilut . Had the world of Nikudim received the entire light, it would have meant the Gmar Tik- kun . Malchut of the World of Infinity would have been completely filled with the light (fulfillment of the Thought of Creation). However, as we know, this did not happen; the vessels broke and fell under the Parsa . Now the world of Atzilut must correct the broken vessels and elevate them above the Parsa ."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 415 Atzilut consists of the five Partzufim , Atik , Arich Anpin , Abba ve Ima and ZON ( ZA and ZA a n d ZA Malchut ). Malchut rises to Bina to pass from Katnut to Gadlut and to receive an opportunity to create its next state – the world of Beria . Prior to that, Malchut was a point; for the creation of the next state, it needs to acquire Aviut Bet . Hence, it rises to Bina and sorts its vessels. Before the vessels were broken, they consisted of only two kinds: the giving and the receiving. Afterwards, these two kinds are supple- mented with two more: the vessels of reception that mixed with the ves- sels of bestowal, and the vessels of bestowal that mixed with the vessels of reception. The ZON de Atzilut are created from the Kelim de GE , sorted out from all the broken and mixed vessels that fell under the Parsa . All ves- sels that have only the “desire to receive” are put aside; they cannot be corrected yet. This is the so-called Lev haEven that will be corrected only after the Gmar Tikkun . After that, only the vessels of reception that mixed with the ves- sels of bestowal, and the vessels of bestowal that mixed with the vessels of reception, remain. Thus, the Creator’s and the creation’s properties were mixed together. How can they be corrected? The worlds of BYA How can they be corrected? The worlds of B Y A How can they be corrected? The worlds of are created from the vessels of bestowal that are inside the vessels of reception (the GE inside the AHP ). The vessels of reception that are inside the vessels of bestowal (the AHP inside the AHP inside the AHP GE ) may be used by way of elevating them to the world of Atzilut . Nothing can exist under the Parsa ; it is the place of very distinct egoistic vessels. However, as the fragments of the altruistic vessels break and fall into them, some form of spiritual light, called the Ohr Tolada (the secondary light), can already shine there. This is necessary for the souls below the worlds of BYA (under the Sium , beneath the barrier, in the point of our world) to mature enough to enter the spiritual world, and receive that property without which they"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 416 cannot exist. They then cross the barrier and proceed to creating a screen for turning the egoistic properties into altruistic ones. Entering the place where the vessels of bestowal are inside the ves- sels of reception, the souls can communicate with them. They receive the light from the fragments of the vessels of bestowal (the right line), simultaneously receiving additional desires from the fragments of the vessels of reception (the left line) in the worlds of BYA , rising systemati- cally from one level to another. Generally, all the worlds are built according to one scheme. The difference is in the fact that the lower the world is, the more it conceals the Creator’s light. Egoism lies at the heart of nature. If it receives a screen it is corrected, and acquires altruistic properties. There are bro- ken vessels that can be corrected during the 6000 years (the levels of the worlds of BYA , 2000 in each). The vessels uncorrected during 6000 years are called Klipot . These can be corrected only after the coming of the Mashiach . The ascending soul contains all kinds of vessels: those that can be corrected, and the Klipot . While ascending, it is important to sort out the vessels correctly in order to separate and ignore the Klipot , using only the remaining ves- sels. This is called the work in three lines. The entire way of ascent is covered with darkness. Each consecu- tive level can be felt only when the light of Hochma enters the corrected vessels. One can advance only by alternately moving between the right and left lines, Creation was not made just for receiving, as was the case with Malchut of the World of Infinity. Hence, man’s state is suspended between the earth (egoism) and the sky (altruism). On each level, we have to go through all the states from Katnut to Gadlut . Having climbed a certain level, man believes he has achieved everything. Then he receives additional desires and resumes his ascent, not knowing what awaits him ahead."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 417 שמתחת , המסיימת המלכות עלית שמפאת ,( ו \" ס אות ) נתבאר כבר ' הא הבחן הנה ( קמה ש \" ב ונפלו יצאו ,' ב צמצום בזמן הנעשה , ג \" דס דנקודות ת \" דז החזה למקום , ק \" א רגלי סיום עוד ראויים ואינם . דנקודות שבחזה החדשה הסיום מנקודת למטה ם \" ונהי ת \" דת תתאין מקום נעשה ת \" דת תתאין ש \" שמב : ע \" בי העולמות ' לג המקום מהם ונעשו . העליון אור לקבל עולם מקום נעשה ומהמלכות , היצירה עולם מקום נעשה י \" נה ספירות ' ומג , הבריאה עולם . העשיה 145) The first definition: as was stated above, as a result of Malchut rising to Bina (Tifferet) of the Nekudot de SAG, the lower two thirds of Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut of this Partzuf fell under the Parsa, and formed the place for the worlds of BYA there. The lower two thirds of Tifferet have become the place of the world of Beria, three Sefirot, Netzah, Hod and Yesod, have become the place of the world of Yetzira, and Malchut has become the place of the world of Assiya. Therefore, the place of the worlds of BYA are the vessels of Nekudot de SAG , specifically, they are in fact the Kelim de AK that submit to the Kelim de AK that submit t o the Kelim de AK laws of TA . Each consecutive Partzuf dresses upon the previous one, which af- Partzuf dr esses upon the pr evious one, whic h af- Partzuf terwards turns out to be inside it. Place means desire. The larger the desire is, the larger the place. This is how it was before TA . After TA , place is determined not by the size of the desire, but by the strength of the screen. The vessel can receive light only in accordance with the size of the screen and not the desire, since there are usually desires in the Partzuf that the screen cannot affect. We should note that the worlds of BYA were created by Malchut de Atzilut , so they actually constitute the AHP de Malchut of the world of Atzilut or Atzilut as a whole. The worlds of BYA descended to the existing “place of BYA ”, which, as we said before, was formed by the vessels of the Nekudot de SAG . As the vessels got broken, the Kelim of bestowal (the GE ) de ZON also fell to “the place of de ZON also f ell t o “the place of de ZON BYA ”. After the creation of the worlds of BYA , one more Partzuf was Partzuf w as Partzuf created inside them. Its name is Adam haRishon . As the worlds began"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 418 ascending, Adam haRishon rose together with them. These ascents con- tinued until it “committed a sin”. The places of the worlds of BYA , i.e., the Nekudot de SAG , ascended together with the worlds. After Adam’s sin and downfall, the worlds of BYA and their place descended. So now, their place (the Nekudot de SAG forming a kind of a frame of the worlds of BYA ) does not ascend, but constantly remains under the Parsa . The worlds of BYA rise together with the souls living in them. ולידתם יציאתם בעת עמידתם ומקום ע \" בי פרצופי קומת שיעורי הוא ' הב והבחן ( קמו כבר והנוקבא , מאבא חיה בחינת א \" הז השיג כבר הזאת שבעת , דע . דאצילות הנוקבא מבטן עליה בדרך אלא א \" מאו המוחין מקבלים ן \" הזו שאין , ידעת וכבר . מאמא נשמה בחינת השיגה , עילאין א \" או הנקרא , דאצילות אבא את מלביש א \" הז : נמצא כ \" וע .( ב \" קמ אות ) והלבשה והאצילה ביררה דאצילות הנוקבא ואז . ת \" ישסו הנקרא , דאצילות לאמא מלבשת והנוקבא . שבו פ \" ה בכללות הבריאה עולם את 146) The second definition: the level of attainment of the Partzufim de BYA and their position at the time of emergence and birth from the Beten de Nukvah of the world of Atzilut. Malchut de Atzilut creates the worlds of BYA. Then, ZA de Atzilut reached the level of Haya (Ho- chma) of Abba, and Nukvah reached the level of Neshama of Ima. As you already know, the ZON receive Mochin from Abba ve Ima only by way of their elevation and dressing upon the upper Partzuf. ZA dresses onto the Partzuf Abba de Atzilut, called the upper Abba ve Ima, and Malchut dresses onto Ima de Atzilut, called YESHSUT. Being in this state, Malchut de Atzilut chooses suitable, yet uncorrected, vessels and creates of them the world Beria with the five Partzufim. We know that a Partzuf emerges from the screen of the previous Partzuf emer ges fr om the scr een of the pr evious Partzuf one, which rose to the Peh de Rosh and made a Zivug there. So it was in Zivug ther e. So it w as in Zivug the world of AK. However, in the worlds of BYA, the Partzufim are born from the Beten , “abdomen” of the previous Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf In the four Behinot de Ohr Yashar, we see that Shoresh creates Behina Aleph , which wants to receive the light. Then Behina Bet emerges from Behina Aleph and refuses to receive the light. After that, a partial “desire to receive” the light is born in it; this Behina is called ZA . However, such"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 419 a desire is born in the lower part of Bina , the Zat de Bina , which wants to receive for the Creator’s sake. Only the lower part of Bina is related to the creations; its upper part does not want to receive anything. Malchut rises to Zat de Bina . Only this part of Bina gives birth to the next Partzuf from its Partzuf fr om its Partzuf Peh (if we view the Zat de Bina as an independent Partzuf , it will be positioned from the Partzuf , it will be positioned fr om the Partzuf Tabur de Bina, and below; another independent Partzuf of common Partzuf of common Partzuf Bina – the Gar de Bina will be above the Tabur ). Thus, the Peh de Zat is on the level of the Beten of the common Partzuf Bina . העולה התחתון כי , אמא למדרגת נחשבת היא הרי , אמא במקום עומדת שהנוקבא וכיון ( קמז מדרגה להיותה , א \" ז למדרגת נבחנת , ידה על שנבררה , הבריאה עולם ולפיכך . כמוהו נעשה לעליון , הבריאה עולם אז ונמצא . א \" ז הוא מאמא והתחתון . אמא בחינת שהיא , להנוקבא תחתונה . דאצילות אמא בחינת אז שהיתה , דאצילות להנוקבא מתחת , דאצילות א \" ז במקום שעומדת 147) Since Malchut is in the place of Ima (Bina), it reaches the level of Ima. Hence, the world of Beria, created from the Beten de Mal- chut (Nukvah) is one level below Ima, and therefore one level below Nukvah, which rose to Ima and reached its level. Thus, at the mo- ment of its birth, the world of Beria is on the level of ZA de Atzilut. במדרגת אז שהוא , הבריאה עולם י \" ע ונאצל שנברר , היצירה עולם נבחן זה פי ועל ( קמח . דאצילות א \" הז בחינת אז שהיה , הבריאה לעולם תחתונה מדרגה להיותה , דאצילות הנוקבא הנוקבא בחינת הם היצירה דעולם ס \" הע כל לא אמנם . נוקבא בחינת היא א \" מהז והתחתון שהם , בנוקבא מצבים ' ב יש כי , הוא והטעם . בלבד דיצירה ראשונות ' הד רק אלא , דאצילות . א \" הז אל שוה קומתה , א \" הז עם פ \" פב שבהיותה : א \" ואב פ \" פב העולמות כל מצב היה שאז ומשום . א \" דז י \" תנה ספירות ' ד רק תופשת היא , א \" אב ובהיותה במקום לו אין היצירה עולם גם כ \" וע . לבד ס \" ד אלא הנוקבא בבחינת היה לא , א \" אב רק ספירות בששה היו דיצירה תחתונות ששה ושאר . שלו ראשונות ס \" ד רק דאצילות הנוקבא ,( ה \" קמ אות ) ' הא שבהבחן ע \" בי מקום תכונות פ \" ע דהיינו . עתה של הבריאה דעולם ראשונות . עתה קביעותם מקום היא ושם , ר \" אדה של חטאו אחר ע \" בי העולמות נפלו ששם 148) The world of Yetzira was created in a similar way. It was birthed after the world of Beria,on the level of Nukvah (Malchut) de Atzilut, which follows ZA. However, only four out of the ten Sefirot of the world of Yetzira are in the place of Nukvah de Atzilut. Concerning"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 420 ZA de Atzilut, Nukvah has two states. If it is at Panim be Panim with ZA, then it is on one level with it and dresses upon it. Both of them have 10 Sefirot in this state. When Nukvah is at Achor be Achor with ZA, it has only its four first Sefirot dressed on the 4 lower Sefirot of ZA. The six upper Sefirot of Nukvah descend one level, i.e., under the Parsa, and take the place of the first 6 Sefirot of the world of Beria. Therefore, when Nukvah is at Panim be Panim with ZA, the world of Yetzira is entirely in the place of Nukvah, i.e., in the world of Atzilut, above the Parsa. In Achor be Achor, when Nukvah (Malchut) de Atzilut has only four Sefirot above the Parsa, the world of Yetzira also has only 4 upper Sefirot above the Parsa. The remaining six Sefirot of the world of Yetzira are on the level of the first six Sefirot of the world of Beria. The place by itself constitutes the vessels of TA . Malchut of the World of Infinity, Galgalta with all the Partzufim dressed on it; the world of Atzilut and the worlds of the BYA , as it were, fill the place, which never changes. All ascents and descents are measured according to place. If places were not constant, we would not be able to determine the move- ment, defined by change of one object with regard to another. As we said, one should differentiate between the worlds of BYA and their places. The place of BYA was formed by the vessels of Nekudot de SAG and is under the Parsa . Two thirds of Tifferet is the place of the world of Beria . Netzah , Hod and Yesod make up the place of the world of Yetzira . Malchut is the place of Assiya . As far as the worlds are concerned, Beria is in the place of ZA de Atzilut at the time of its birth, i.e., on one level with it. The world of Yetzira is either on the level of Nukvah de Atzi- lut (in Panim be Panim ) or has only 4 Sefirot on this level, while 6 lower Sefirot are under the Parsa in the place of the 6 upper Sefirot of Beria . The lowest 10 th part of any Partzuf is called Partzuf is called Partzuf Malchut . After TB and up to the Final Correction, its use is forbidden. Therefore, a circumci-"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 421 sion takes place; this Sefira is removed and a Zivug is made on the Zivug is made on the Zivug Ateret haYesod . Each member of our group donates the tenth part of his income that cannot be used until the Gmar Tikkun . Only the corrected nine parts may be worked with. This is done in correspondence with the spiritual worlds. מתוך כי . עתה של בריאה למדרגת נבחן , היצירה עולם י '' ע שנברר , העשיה ועולם ( קמט , העשיה עולם שמתחתיה המדרגה נמצא , דאצילות הנוקבא במדרגת אז היה היצירה שעולם הנוקבא בבחינת היה דיצירה ר \" הד שרק מתוך אלא . עתה של הבריאה עולם בבחינת שהוא נמצאים , שמתחתיה העשיה עולם גם לכן , הבריאה בעולם היו שלה תחתונות והשש , דאצילות היו העשיה דעולם התחתונות והשש , הבריאה דעולם תחתונות ס \" ד בבחינת שלו ר \" הד רק . עתה של היצירה דעולם ראשונות שש במקום היו , עתה של עשיה דעולם ס \" הע וכל , עתה של דיצירה ם \" נהי שהם , הספירות ד \" י אז ונמצאו ספירות ד \" י במקום נמצאות היו הקליפות רק כי . הקליפות למדור ונעשו . קדושה מכל ריקנות נתבאר והנה . עתה של היצירה דעולם החזה במקום נסתיימו דקדושה העולמות כי . הללו . בראשונה שנאצלו בעת עמידתם ומקום ע \" בי פרצופי של הקומה שיעורי מדרגות 149) The world of Assiya corrected with the help of the world of Yetzira is defined as the level, taken by the world of Beria today. This is because previously the world of Yetzira was on the level of Nukvah de Atzilut. That is why the level below it refers to the world of Assiya – today’s Beria. However, only the 4 first Sefirot de Yetzira were on the level of the Nukvah de Atzilut, while its 6 lower Sefirot were on the level of Beria. Hence, the 4 first Sefirot de Assiya are on the level of the 4 lower Sefirot de Beria, and the 6 first Sefirot de Assiya are in the place of the 6 upper Sefirot of the actual location of Yetzira. Thus, the four Sefirot de Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut of today’s Yetzira and all the 10 Sefirot of the actual world of Assiya stopped being related to Kedusha (holiness) and passed to the Klipot (the uncorrected desires). The level from the Chazeh de Yetzira to the Sium de Assiya cannot be taken by anything but the Klipot; the pure worlds are located above the Chazeh of today’s Yetzira. Now we"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 422 know the levels taken by the worlds of BYA and their place, created before the actual formation of those worlds. So, before the sin of Adam haRishon , at the moment of creation of the worlds of BYA , the worlds and the Partzufim were positioned in the following way: 1. ZA de Atzilut was on today’s level of Arich Anpin (Abba, Hochma). 2. Malchut (Nukvah) de Atzilut was on the level of 2. Malchut (Nukvah) de Atzilut w a s o n t h e l e v e l o f 2. Malchut (Nukvah) de Atzilut Abba ve Ima (Bina). 3. The world of Beria was on the level of today’s ZA de Atzilut. 4. The four upper Sefirot of the world of Yetzira were on the level of Malchut de Atzilut and the six lower Sefirot – on the level of the six upper Sefirot of today’s world of Beria . We may say that the places of Malchut and ZA de Atzilut in Gadlut (10 Sefirot in each) are not one under the other, but on the same level. When Malchut is in Katnut , its four upper Sefirot are on the level of the four lower Sefirot of ZA , and its six lower Sefirot are under the Parsa . 5. The four upper Sefirot of the world of Assiya were on the level of the four lower Sefirot of today’s world of Beria ; its six lower Sefirot were on the level of today’s world of Yetzira . Thus, previously all the worlds were 14 Sefirot higher than they are now. After the breaking of the vessels, the screen rose to the Rosh de SAG with all the Reshimot left from the breaking above the Parsa and with all the fragments that fell down. The screen is in Nikvey Eynaim de Keter of the Rosh de SAG . It begins to make Zivugim on the Reshimot left in it after the breaking. Since the breaking of the vessels included the entire Malchut of the World of Infinity, there were Reshimot left on all kinds of broken vessels that fell under the Parsa . First, the Masach selects the best Reshimot and makes a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug them. Further Zivugim are performed on the remaining Reshimot accord- ing to their deterioration. These Zivugim lead to the birth of the Partzufim one after another, from the best to the worst. First, Atik is born, then"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 423 Arich Anpin , Abba ve Ima , YESHSUT , ZA and Nukvah de Atzilut . All the Reshimot of GE (the vessels of bestowal) end here. In addition to the vessels that have only one desire – either to be- stow or to receive, vessels emerge that have both of these desires mixed. Now they can be sorted out and create additional Partzufim . Malchut of the World of Infinity undertakes this mission. Initially, it is just a point with a single Sefira, Keter . Then it rises to ZA and receives the state of Katnut there. After that, it rises to Bina and grows to match its size. Now it can give birth like the higher Partzufim. Being on the level of Bina , it makes a Zivug on Zivug on Zivug Bet de Aviut and gives birth to the world of Beria , which has to descend one level below its mother, i.e., to the level of ZA de Atzilut . The world of Yetzira is born from a Zivug de Haka’a on Gimel de Aviut and descends below ZA , i.e., to Nukvah de Atzilut . Nukvah is not completely under ZA , but dresses its four upper Sefirot on it, its six lower Sefirot being under the Parsa . Hence, the world of Yetzira takes the place of Nukvah and its four upper Sefirot cover the four lower Sefirot of ZA , while its six lower Sefirot dress onto six lower Sefirot de Nukvah, under the Parsa , i.e., overlap with the six first Sefirot of the place of Beria in its actual location. If some Partzuf ascends to or descends from a certain level, it means Partzuf ascends t o or descends fr om a cer t ain lev el, it means Partzuf that it assumes the properties of the level on which it currently rests. Even in our world, if a person feels the desire to do something good, he is thought to be improving his properties and spiritually rising. “I ascend,” means that my properties do not correspond to the level I was on previously, but reach a higher level that I dress upon, so to speak. Now, we begin to study how all the Partzufim of the world of Atzi- lut dress, one after the other, onto their corresponding Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon . The spiritual world’s ladder is permanent; it can move up and down as a whole with regard to something. Nothing dis-"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 424 appears in the spiritual realm.

There were two ascents of the worlds with the help of the additional light on Shabbat. The first ascent took place on the fifth hour of Erev (eve) Shabbat, when Adam haRishon was born. Then the additional light of Shabbat called “Hey de Yom haShishi” began to shine. At that time, ZA reached the level of Yechida, rose, and dressed upon Arich Anpin de Atzilut. The Nukvah reached the level of Haya, then rose and dressed upon Abba ve Ima de Atzilut. Beria rose to YESHSUT, Yetzira – to ZA; the four first Sefirot de Assiya rose to the place of Nukvah de Atzilut. The six lower Sefirot de Assiya rose to the six upper Sefirot de Beria. The second ascent of the worlds took place on Erev of Shabbat when, with the help of the additional light on Shabbat, the six lower Sefirot de Assiya rose to the place of Nukvah de Atzilut. Thus, both worlds, Yetzira and Assiya, rose above the Parsa and found their place in ZON de Atzilut in the state of Panim de Panim."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 425 The worlds of BYA were born before Adam haRishon . Then Partzuf Adam haRishon emerged. It was born from Malchut de Atzilut that had risen to Bina . What is the difference between the births of Adam haRis- hon and the worlds of BYA ? The worlds of BYA are created from GE , which fell to AHP of AHP of AHP ZON de Nikudim . Adam haRishon is a totally new construction that derives from the inner thought of creation. When the 4 phases of Direct Light were completed and Malchut of the World of Infinity emerged, it began to receive the light that gradually revealed its previous parts, Gimel, Bet, Aleph, and Shoresh , which had given birth to it. Malchut cannot overstep its own limits, but it discovers the previ- ous phases due to the deeper attainment of light that fills it. Malchut gradually starts building up nine more Sefirot (the light properties) out of the initial point and attains them little by little. The tenth part is Malchut itself. It makes a Tzimtzum on this tenth part (on itself) and wishes to become similar to the nine Sefirot - Partzufim . Not all worlds and Partzufim are Malchut itself. They are just its attempts to copy the light, mere life- less objects. The central point of the creation – Malchut of the World of Infinity, starts working after the completion of all the worlds and the breaking of the vessels. A special combination between Malchut de Malchut (the Essence of the Creation) and the nine first Sefirot is called Adam haRishon . It is destined to become equal to the Creator. During TB, Malchut of the World of Infinity rose to Tifferet of Nekudot de SAG , separating the vessels of reception from the vessels of bestowal. It remained there ever since. Malchut de Atzilut , which is also on the level of the Parsa , is its direct representative. Then Malchut de Atzilut rises to Bina and makes a Zivug de Haka’a only on the GE ; it does not work with the AHP ."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 426 The created Partzuf , which has so far only the vessels of Partzuf , whic h has so f ar only the v essels of Partzuf GE , is called Adam haRishon . The direct participation of Malchut of the World of Infinity in the creation of Adam haRishon turns it into the most impor- tant Partzuf . In fact, it is the true Creation. The difference between Partzuf . In f act, it is the true Cr eation. The dif f er ence be tw een Partzuf Adam haRishon and all other spiritual objects is enormous. Since it was also born from Malchut de Atzilut , which gave birth to the worlds of the BYA , Adam haRishon is inside these worlds. Its head begins below Malchut located in Bina , in the place of ZA de Atzilut . Its throat corresponds with the four upper Sefirot of Malchut de Atzilut above the Parsa . The body from the shoulders to the Tabur, is below the Parsa , in the place of the first six Sefirot of the world Beria, or in the place of the six lower Sefirot of the world Yetzira or in the place of the six lower Sefirot of the Malchut de Atzilut . Then the Partzuf Adam haRishon spreads from the Chazeh of the world of Beria to its end; its feet end on the level of Chazeh de Yetzira , where the world of Assiya ends in this particular state. The height of Partzuf Adam haRishon is equal to that of the worlds of BYA . Such was the state of the Partzuf Adam haRishon at the moment of its birth. A totally new structure was born. If previously only the environ- ment for correction of the creation (called the central point or the Mal- chut of the World of Infinity) was being created, now it can be completely corrected. The common soul of Adam must be broken into fragments that altruistic desires will later enter. The breaking of the Partzuf Adam haRishon was similar to the breaking of the Kelim de Nikudim . The ves- sels of bestowal will enter the central point. This could not be achieved before. Now let us see how the breaking of the Partzuf Adam haRishon , which is inside the worlds of BYA and can ascend and descend only together with them, took place. Adam HaRishon, with its vessels of bestowal, performed all kinds of different actions, but then it realized that the most significant action"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 427 for the Creator’s sake can be done only through receiving the light of Hochma. It must have the vessels of reception, which are absent in it, or, rather, not yet corrected. Its intentions were quite clear. Hence, it starts attaching to itself the vessels of reception, where- upon they break (as they previously did in the world of Nikudim ) inside its Guf , both the Guf , bo th the Guf GE and the AHP . After the breaking, altruistic sparks penetrate the vessels of reception. From this point on, the work of each fragment of Adam’s soul (feeling separate from one another) begins. All this corresponds to what must be done by everyone in this world. When Adam’s soul was broken, in addition to the downfall of the vessels from the level of Atzilut , a whole system of impure worlds was formed: Atzilut , Beria , Yetzira, and Assiya de Tuma , which correspond to the four pure worlds. Human souls exist between these two systems. Our present state is a consequence of the breaking of Adam haRis- hon’s soul. We are a construction consisting of a biological body saturated with egoistic desires. As we mentioned, altruistic sparks, called the “Ner Dakik” (a tiny candle), fell inside these desires. If the Ner Dakik manifests in an altruistic desire, man starts longing for something uncertain, trying to satisfy that wish. But there is nothing in our world that can fill this desire – all plea- sures of this world are egoistic. Man would run around searching, until he finds a source that can (or so it will seem to him) somehow fill the void or will do so in the future. If this is a group of students headed by a Teacher-Kabbalist, then such a man will gradually begin to transform his egoistic vessels into altruistic ones, attaining the Creator in them. How does this correction take place? There are 320 sparks inside each human being. Man must do exactly what happened in the world of Atzilut , i.e., sort out the 288 sparks and separate them from the Lev haEven (32 egoistic sparks), from its central point, (the egoistic essence, nature), and say that he stops working with them in order to become similar to the altruistic desires."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 428 Man should do it consciously, by sparing no effort, overcoming the formidable resistance of his own egoism. This work forms the ves- sels that man did not have before. As a result, it allows him to work with the nine altruistic Sefirot , the Lev haEven remaining inactive. Upon sorting out all altruistic desires and restricting 32 egoistic desires, man achieves the Gmar Tikkun . By struggling against his egoism, he pre- ferred to become equal to the Creator. After that, the upper light descends from above and corrects the Lev haEven in such a way that it may now be used for receiving the Ohr Hochma for the sake of the Creator. Somehow, the light AB-SAG affects this point and corrects it. Such correction is called the arrival of the Mashiach ; the Malchut of the World of Infinity completely merges with the Creator, i.e., reaches its third and final state. It is worth mentioning that the first state is the Malchut of the World of Infinity prior to Tzim- tzum Aleph . The second state is the descending formation of the worlds and the creation’s correction through gradual ascent. The additional light for the ascent of Adam haRishon is called the “Hey de Yom haShishi” , i.e., the 5 th hour of the 6 th day. Adam haRishon reaches this level together with the worlds of BYA . This is the first ascent (the 10 Sefirot of one world) on the eve of Shabbat . If before this ascent the feet of Adam haRishon and the world of Assiya were on the level of the Chazeh de Yetzira , then afterwards they ascend to the Chazeh de Beria . The world of Atzilut has many states. We must be very attentive while Atzilut h a s m a n y s t a t e s . W e m u s t b e v e r y a t t e n t i v e w h i l e Atzilut studying the world of Atzilut – in accordance with the changes in man’s Atzilut – i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h e c h a n g e s i n m a n ’ s Atzilut sensations in the process of his correction. All the names of the Torah have definite roots in the world of Atzilut – one source of all that exists. Atzilut – o n e s o u r c e o f a l l t h a t e x i s t s . Atzilut This includes the general and individual control, the soul’s rein- carnations, the ascents and descents, etc. If man studies the material cor- rectly, he steps back each time he starts learning about Atzilut , realizing that it is over his head. This happens several times for a few years, until man begins to establish contact with this enormous system, when some form of connection with the world of Atzilut manifests inside him."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 429 The purest desires rise during the first ascent, while the darkest, most egoistic sink, forming a division between the corrected and the uncorrected desires in both man and the worlds. The emptiness that formed between them, is called “Tehum Shabbat” . In our world, it is sym- bolized by the distance a man may move away from a city wall without violating the laws of Shabbat . Man is not allowed to leave “the domain of the One” for “the do- main of the many”. “The domain of the One” ( the “Reshut haYachid”) is a state, when all of man’s thoughts, desires and prayers are directed to the Creator, when man always justifies Him and perceives all His deeds as those of “the Kind One Creating Goodness” (“Tov ve Meitiv”). Such desires are completely corrected and are in the world of Atzilut . As well, man also has the desires that have not been corrected yet. He is still in doubt: does the Creator rule over everything or not, and if He does, is His rule good or bad? Perhaps the society, the boss, the wife, or the children are to blame in all his troubles. These diverse aspira- tions and thoughts in man are called “the domain of the many” (“Reshut haRabim”). These desires are below the Chazeh de Yetzira and down to the Sium . In all, they constitute 14 Sefirot and are called the Mador (section) Mador (section) Mador haKlipot . After the Shabbat ascents, the section from the Parsa de Atzilut to the Mador haKlipot is an empty space consisting of 16 Sefirot . These are in turn divided into two parts: the first part is made up of the six upper Sefirot of the world of Beria , the second part – the ten Sefirot from the Chazeh de Beria to the Chazeh de Yetzira . The first six Sefirot of the world of Beria are called “Iburo shel Yir” (“conception of a city”). This can be compared to a pregnant woman whose belly belongs to her, but which at the same time protrudes because there is a foreign body inside it. On the one hand, it is so far related to her, but, on the other – may be con- sidered as a separate entity. Such a state is called Ibur : still related to the upper one, but also to a new creation."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 430 The world of Atzilut , the Creator’s domain, is called “a city”. In his thoughts, man can step out of the city's bounds (albeit no farther than the Chazeh de Beria ) without committing a transgression. This additional section ( “Iburo shel Yir” ) is the 70 Amah (an Amah is the distance from wrist to elbow, i.e., seven Sefirot : HaBaD HaGaT ) from the HaBaD HaGaT ) fr om the HaBaD HaGaT Chazeh . This still refers to the city, although outside its walls. At the end of the 70 Amah from the Chazeh de Yetzira to the Chazeh de Beria, an additional area of 2000 Amah stretches on. These are 10 Se- firot called “Tehum Shabbat” . Man can step into these 2000 Amah without transgressing his unity with the Creator, called Shabbat , because there are no impure desires in this area. Such is the power of the Shabbat lumines- cence; it allows man, who is in the world of Atzilut , to descend to that level without losing his connection with the Creator. Thus, the 16 upper Sefirot of the worlds of BYA are still the vessels of bestowal; therefore, man can be in them without leaving the bounds of Atzilut . We have examined the two ascents of the worlds of BYA and Adam haRishon to Atzilut (first, 6 Sefirot , then 10 more) that took place on the eve of Shabbat . Sixteen empty Sefirot are in this state below the world of Atzilut down to the Chazeh de Yetzira . They are still regarded as the vessels of bestowal; hence, their properties are very close to those of Atzilut . As was stated above, the worlds of BYA were created from the bro- ken vessels of the world of Nikudim that fell under the Parsa and inter- mixed. This created the following four kinds: vessels of bestowal, vessels of reception, vessels of reception mixed with vessels of bestowal and ves- sels of bestowal mixed with vessels of reception. First, the Partzuf SAG se- lects the vessels of bestowal out of all the broken fragments. These form the world of Atzilut that consists exclusively of GE , which even before the breaking were in the world of Nikudim as GE de ZON . ZON de Atzilut correspond to ZON de Nikudim ."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 431 Three kinds of vessels remain unused: 1. The egoistic vessels of reception. The SAG sorts them out, puts them aside, and does not work with them. This is the Lev haEven ; no altruistic intentions can correct it until the Gmar Tikkun . 2. The vessels of bestowal that fell into the vessels of reception and cannot be separated from them. These are the worlds of BYA , which re- semble a narrow lucid altruistic stripe within a mass of egoistic desires. 3. The vessels of reception are included in the vessels of bestowal. They are called “ AHP de Aliyah ” of the world of Atzilut . With their help, Ohr Hochma can be received in addition to Ohr Hassadim in Atzilut , thus allowing it to receive Gadlut . Thus, we have learned what can be received out of all four kinds of broken vessels of the ZON de Nikudim . As Adam’s soul breaks, four more kinds of broken vessels are formed. They are not in the worlds of BYA anymore, but fall to our world under the Sium de Galgalta . All these breakings lead to the fact that there are roots of the altruistic desires (the AHP de Elion ) inside GE de Tachton (the lower Partzuf ). Thus, it becomes possible to correct the vessels. Partzuf ). Thus, it becomes possible t o corr ect the v essels. Partzuf Now, if man begins to study in a proper group, guided by a true Teacher, he attracts the influence of the Surrounding Light ( the Ohr Makif) , which gradually purifies the fragments of GE inside his egoistic vessels. Inside himself, man builds his own world of Atzilut with the help of the corrected vessels of GE . On each level, the Lev haEven is not worked with. Therefore, it turns out that man reflects all that seemingly happens outside of him, i.e., the worlds of AK and of AK and of AK BYA . As he corrects his vessels, man receives the light of AK ABYA . Upon completing his correc- tion, he becomes equal to the distance between the central point of our world and the World of Infinity, i.e., he matches the size of Galgalta , and all the corrected fragments (all human souls) completely fill the entire Malchut of the World of Infinity with the light."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 432 לאחר נפילתם ומקום . ע \" בבי שנשתיירו המוחין קומת שהוא ,' הד הבחן נבאר ועתה ( קנא , דתוספת המוחין כל מהעולמות נסתלקו , ד \" עצה של חטאו פגם מחמת כי , והוא . החטא . ונקודה ק \" לו חזר ן \" והזו . העליות ' ב י \" ע שהשיגו 151) Now let us clear up the fourth definition – the level of the Mochin in the worlds of BYA and the place of these worlds’ downfall after the sin of Adam haRishon. It is known that, due to the damage caused by Adam’s sin, the Mochin completely disappeared from these worlds, i.e., all the additional light that the worlds received during the two ascents on Shabbat eve. Furthermore, ZON de Atzilut returned to the state of Vak and Nekuda . This means that now, as regards the vessels, ZA again has only the six ZA a g a i n h a s o n l y t h e s i x ZA upper Sefirot, HaBaD HaGaT , filled with the six “lower” lights, the HaGaT NHY (inverse relation between the lights and the vessels).

They are in the state of Vak (ZA). Moreover, they fell under the Parsa to the place of the worlds of BYA, prepared for them after TB. Now the 4 last Sefirot of the world of Yetzira and all 10 Sefirot of the world of Assiya are in the place of the 14 Sefirot of the Mador haKlipot. ע \" הבי שיצאו אחר כי . נפילתם במקום ע \" בי שקבלו , דאמא המוחין הוא ' הה הבחן ( קנב ואז .( א \" קנ אות ) ק \" ו בחינת אלא בהם היה לא , דאצילות הפרסא למתחת ונפלו מאצילות והשפיעו . ן \" בזו התלבשות מבחינת ת \" הישסו ונזדווגו . דאצילות ן \" בהזו ת \" הישסו נתלבשו , בינה בקומת שלמות ס \" ע מהם קבל הבריאה שעולם : במקומם ע \" בי לפרצופי דנשמה מוחין . א \" אב בחינת רק העשיה ועולם , ק \" ו מהם קבל היצירה ועולם"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 433 152) The fifth peculiarity of the worlds of BYA consists in the fact that, during the fall, they received the Mochin de Ima. When the worlds of BYA left Atzilut and fell under the Parsa, they were on the level of Vak. Then YESHSUT de Atzilut dressed upon ZON de Atzilut, made a Zivug on the Reshimo de Hitlabshut in ZON, and passed the light of Neshama to the worlds of BYA. Thus, the world of Beria received from it 10 full Sefirot on the level of Bina, the world of Yetzira –Vak de Bina, and the world of Assiya – only Behina Achor be Achor, i.e., one point of the Malchut de Bina. . אצילות פ \" דה האחור מפרצופי ע \" בי פרצופי שהשיגו , לנשמה נשמה בחינת הוא ' הו הבחן ( קנג ' ג כולל והוא . ע \" בי בפרצופי ונתלבש דאצילות דנוקבא האחור פרצוף נפל הירח מיעוט בעת כי נפלה היניקה ובחינת , לבריאה נפלה המוחין ובחינת . מוחין , יניקה , עבור : המכונים , פרצופים שהיא , ע \" בי פרצופי לכל לנשמה נשמה בחינת ונעשו . לעשיה נפלה העיבור ובחינת , ליצירה . אליהם חיה בחינת 153) The sixth peculiarity is the level of Neshama de Neshama (Haya) reached by the worlds of BYA from the five Partzufim de Achoraim of the world of Atzilut. It happened because during the lunar diminution (Miut haYareach), i.e., Malchut de Atzilut, nine of its lower Sefirot forming the “Partzuf de Achor de Nukvah” fell under the Parsa and dressed on the Partzufim BYA, which included three stages: Ibur, Yenika and Mochin. The Behinat Mochin (adult state) fell to the world of Beria, Behina Yenika fell to Yetzira, and Behina Ibur fell to Assiya. Thus, all three worlds of BYA received Behina Neshama le Neshama. ZA builds Malchut , and gives it all the power. The final, ultimate state comes when ZA and Malchut become equal and establish full con- tact with one another. Then Malchut receives from ZA without restraint, at the same time being pleased to bestow delight upon it. This final state is called a Zivug de ZON Panim de Panim . Malchut wished to achieve it already on the fourth day of creation. Eager to receive the light from Bina , Malchut rose to Malchut r o s e t o Malchut ZA , but discovered that its (of Malchut ) vessels are defective; hence, instead of the light, it received total darkness."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 434 Darkness is Ohr Hochma not dressed in Ohr Hassadim . Therefore, Malchut starts complaining that the two Partzufim cannot possibly receive the light from the same source. ZA has both Ohr Hassadim and Ohr Ho- chma . Malchut , however, has no Ohr Hassadim ; it must correct its vessels, its intentions. The only way out of this state is to contract into a point (one Sefira ), assume its natural size and start gradually correcting its vessels, i.e., ac- quire a screen. The diminution of Malchut is called a Kitrug haYareach , i.e., the Moon’s ( Malchut’s ) complaint about being unable to shine like the Sun ( ZA ). It has to turn itself into a point and then start growing system- atically, until it reaches the ultimate state. Still it will not be able to shine like the Sun, i.e., in any case Malchut will receive the light from ZA . , נתבאר כי . ע \" בבי יחידה ולהארת א \" לרדל שנעשתה , דאצילות הנוקבא הוא ' הז הבחן ( קנד דנוקבא האחור דפרצוף ( מוחין , יניקה , עיבור ) מ \" עי הבחינות ' ג נפלו , הירח מיעוט שבעת נקרא י \" שנה : מ \" עי שהם , דנוקבא ת \" דט אחורים בחינת והם . ע \" בבי ונתלבשו דאצילות .\" מוחין \" נקרא ד \" וחב ,\" יניקה \" נקרא ת \" וחג ,\" עיבור \" באופו . ע \" בי לפרצופי עתיק לבחינת נעשתה , דנוקבא הכתר דבחינת האחור בחינת אמנם של חטאו אחר בהם שנשארו מהשירים הם , עתה של ע \" בי דפרצופי אורותיהם עיקר שבחינת דאמא ממוחין קבלו נשמה ובחינת .( א \" קנ אות ) מהם פרט דכל ק \" הו בחינת שהוא , ר \" אדה , דנוקבא האחור דפרצוף ת \" מט קבלו , חיה בחינת שהוא , לנשמה נשמה ובחינת ,( ב \" קנ אות ) . דאצילות דנוקבא דכתר האחור מבחינת קבלו יחידה ובחינת 154) The seventh peculiarity is the Sefira Keter of Nukvah de Atzi- lut, absolutely unattainable by the worlds of BYA, but which ema- nates faint luminescence of Ohr Yechida onto them. As it turned out, during the lunar diminution, Behinot Ibur, Yenika and Mochin of the back part of Nukva de Atzilut fell under the Parsa and dressed upon the worlds of the BYA. The NHY are called Ibur, HaGaT – Yenika and HaBaD –Mochin. However, Achoraim of Keter de Nukva turn into Atik as regards the Partzufim de BYA, and are unattainable. The light shining in BYA is just a faint luminescence, compared to what it was prior to the “Fall” (sin). The worlds receive Ohr Nefesh from Ibur, Ohr"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 435 Ruach – from Yenika and Ohr Neshama – from Mochin de Ima. The Neshama de Neshama (the Ohr Haya) is received from the nine lower Sefirot de Nukva and Behinat Yechida – from the Achoraim de Keter of Nukva de Atzilut (the point of Malchut de Atzilut). We have already mentioned that, on the fourth day of creation, a so-called lunar diminution took place. Malchut de Atzilut wishes to be like ZA de Atzilut , so it rises to Bina , but cannot receive the same light as ZA gets, for it neither has the intention to receive for the Creator’s sake, nor the screen to resist the egoistic desires. Only upon receiving the Ohr Hassadim , which would dress onto the Ohr Hochma and take it in, will it be able to acquire the properties of ZA . Hence, Bina refuses to receive the Ohr Hochma . Instead of Ohr Hochma , Malchut felt darkness. This happens when there are desires without the proper intentions. Existing in our world, we feel neither darkness, nor light. We can- not feel the preliminary state of darkness for the lack of the necessary desire to receive pleasure, even for our own sake. When the enormous desire acquired for spiritual delight becomes as all-consuming as a great love, we will discover within ourselves the intention to receive the light for the sake of the Creator. How can this be done? Bina advises Malchut to diminish itself. Mal- chut contracts into a point and begins gradually to acquire a screen in the three stages Ibur , Yenika, and Mochin ."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 436 T H E A S C E N T S O F T H E W O R L D S העולמות עליות ענין ביאור מבחינת הם ק \" א פרצופי כי , הוא האצילות עולם לפרצופי ק \" א מפרצופי ההפרש עיקר ( קנה כלי שהוא , אחד כלי בחינת רק ס \" בע ואין . שלמות ס \" ע בה יש שבו מדרגה שבכל .' א צמצום . לבד אורות בחינת רק הן ראשונות ס \" הט אבל . מלכות ארץ אלהים ה \" הוי עשות ביום \" ה \" בסו ,' הב צמצום מבחינת הם אצילות פרצופי כ \" משא , בהבינה ונתחברה עלתה , מלכות שהיא , הדין שמדת .( ט \" נ אות ) בדין רחמים ששיתף ,\" ושמים . יחד ונשתתפו . הרחמים מדת שהיא עלתה הגוף את המסיימת שהמלכות . הבינה במקום העליון אור על חדש סיום נעשה ז \" שעי , דראש לבינה עלתה דראש שבפה המזדווגת והמלכות . החזה במקום , ת \" ת שהיא , דגוף לבינה , דכלים חכמה כתר שהם , ע \" לגו הפרצופים קומת שיעור נתמעטו ז \" שעי ,\" עינים נקבי \" הנקרא שהם , דכלים פ \" מאח חסרים ונמצאו .( ד \" ע אות ) דאורות רוח נפש שהוא , ראש בלי ק \" ו בקומת . דאורות יחידה חיה ומנשמה , ן \" וזו בינה 155) The principal distinction between the worlds of AK and Atzilut consists in the fact that the Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon emerged as a consequence of Tzimtzum Aleph. Each of their levels includes 10 full Sefirot with one single vessel – Malchut. The nine first Sefirot constitute exclusively the light, the Creator. The Partzufim de Atzilut is the result of Tzimtzum Bet. When we say that on that day the Creator created the Heaven and the Earth, we mean the Rachamim (mercy) were included in the Din (judg- ment) during the ascent of Malchut (the level of Din) to Bina (the level of Rachamim) and their merging. As a result, a new Sium of the Upper Light appeared in Bina on the level of Chazeh (as Malchut Mesayemet rises to Bina). The Malchut Mizdaveget, which was in the Peh de Rosh, rose to Bina de Rosh called the Nikvey Eynaim, so that only the vessels Keter and Ho- chma remained on the level of Vak without the Rosh, i.e., the lights Nefesh and Ruach. Out of the five vessels, Bina, ZA and Malchut are absent as well as the lights Neshama, Haya and Yechida."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 437 The worlds have two parts: the inner and the outer. The place of ABYA is called the outer worlds. Inside this place, there must be an inner part where the world of Nikudim is located. The root of the outer part of the worlds is the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG that merged with Behina Dalet during its descent under Tabur de Galgalta . From the merging of the Be- hinot Bet and Dalet , the place between the Tabur and the Tabur and the Tabur Sium split into two parts: the place of Atzilut and the place of BYA . There are 10 vessels in each Partzuf of the worlds of Partzuf of the w orlds of Partzuf ABYA and Nikudim . This was caused by the rise of Malchut to Bina of each Sefira . In TA, there is only one Kli , since below there is only one Malchut , that receives the light from the nine first Sefirot . Ten Kelim are formed in TB. Due to the Second Restriction, Mal- chut ascends to the nine first Sefirot ( Tet Rishonot ). Are these Sefirot con- sidered the lights? Does Malchut rise to the lights? There is a rule: Behina Dalet is called the Kli , and the nine first Sefirot are called the lights. The “desire to receive” is Behina Dalet ; hence, it is separated from the light. In the spiritual world, Behina Dalet is recep- tion for its own sake without a hint of bestowal. The first nine Sefirot are the lights and Malchut receives all that these nine Sefirot have to offer. Now this Behina pushes the light away, as if to say, if I can work with the altruistic intention like the light, then I should receive for the sake of bestowal. This transformation of the inten- tion is the essential difference between work for the Creator’s sake and reception for one’s own. הארת אצילות פרצופי השיגו ' ב לעיבור ן \" מ עלית י \" שע ,( ד \" קכ אות ) שנתבאר והגם ( קנו ,' א כבצמצום , לפה למקומה בחזרה עינים מנקבי ת \" הה המוריד , ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" מע המוחין . דאורות יחידה חיה והנשמה דכלים פ \" האח שוב ומשיגים הללו המוחין כי , שלהם להגופים ולא , הפרצופים של דראש ס \" הע לבחינת רק הועיל זה אמנם נשארו , דגדלות המוחין לאחר גם כ \" וע .( ח \" קל אות ) שלהם הגופים אל ולמטה מפה נמשכו לא . הקטנות בזמן כמו ,' ב בצמצום הגופים"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 438 שהוא , א \" דבחי עביות על היוצאת ס \" ע קומת רק להם שאין , אצילות פ \" ה כל נחשבו זה ומשום דהיינו , ק \" א פ \" דה ה \" מ קומת על מלבישים והם . ה \" מ קומת הנקרא , ראש בלי ק \" ו , א \" ז קומת . ק \" א פ \" דה ולמטה מטבור 156) As was stated above, with the help of raising of MAN during the second Ibur, the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut received the light of Hochma from the Partzufim AB-SAG de AK. This light again lowered Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de Rosh to Peh, as was the case before TB. Hence, the Partzufim again acquire the hitherto missing Kelim de Bina, ZA and Malchut and, correspondingly, the lights of Neshama, Haya, and Yechida. This refers only to the 10 Sefirot de Rosh, but not to the Guf, since the light of Hochma has not yet spread from the Peh de Rosh to the Guf, so, even upon receiving the Mochin de Gadlut de Rosh, the Gufim still remained in the state of TB, as in Katnut. Thus, the Partzufim de Atzilut are regarded as the level of the 10 Sefirot that emerged on Aviut de Behina Aleph. This corresponds to the level of ZA (Vak without Rosh), and is called the world of MA. They dress upon the Partzufim de MA (ZA) of the five Partzufim de AK, located below the Tabur. A certain ban exists in the world of Atzilut : the light of the Rosh does not spread to the Guf . Once, Guf . O n c e , Guf Gadlut spread from the Rosh to the Rosh t o t h e Rosh Guf in the world of Nikudim , which led to the breaking of the vessels. In the world of AK, world of A K , world of we see that whatever is in the Rosh later spreads to the Rosh l a t e r s p r e a d s t o t h e Rosh Guf . Guf . Guf After the breaking of the vessels in the world of Nikudim, the Reshi- mot remained. They clearly state that Gadlut , which occurred in the Rosh after the raising of MAN , will not pass to the Guf – it is forbidden. Guf – it is f orbidden. Guf Hence, the light of Gadlut will never pass from the Rosh to the Guf in Guf in Guf the world of Atzilut . Does it mean that the vessels of reception cannot be used? Then how will the correction take place? The entire following process is a correction of egoism with the help of a very special method defined as the AHP de Aliyah, or the middle line."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 439 However, in the world of Atzilut the light of Gadlut will never spread to the Guf , even provided an accurate calculation is made stating that it is Guf , ev en pr o vided an accur at e calculation is made s t ating that it is Guf quite safe to receive the light for the Creator’s sake. It will never happen again in the spiritual world because of the remaining Reshimot . All the Partzufim of the world of Adam Kadmon are divided in the following way: the Rosh is called Keter , the place from the Peh to the Chazeh is called Hochma , from the Chazeh to the Tabur – Bina , from the Tabur to Tabur t o Tabur Yesod – ZA, and the place from Yesod down to the Sium is called Malchut . If we take Galgalta , its Rosh is called Keter ; from the Peh to the Chazeh is AB , from the Chazeh to the Tabur – Tabur – Tabur SAG , from the Tabur to Tabur t o Tabur Yesod – MA and from Yesod to the Sium – BON . Each Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf Atzilut dresses onto the corresponding part of the Guf de AK . For example, the Partzuf Atik de Atzilut refers to the Partzuf Galgalta as MA , i.e., the way ZA refers to Keter . The Rosh of any Partzuf is a consequence of the previous state, Partzuf is a conseq uence of the pr evious s t at e, Partzuf which already passed and left the Reshimot . A new state appears based on these Reshimot with all the contiguous details. Hence, the Rosh contains all the information of the past. As in our world, there is nothing unusual or unknown. Knowing the qualities of parents, we can more or less imagine and describe their future baby. As each new Partzuf emerges, one can very accurately foresee Partzuf emer ges, one can v er y accur at ely f or esee Partzuf what it will be like. However, what happened in the world of Nikudim does not seem to have been preprogrammed. There is one more Rosh – YESHSUT , which is under the Tabur de Galgalta and refers to TA . The lower Rashim are unaware of what happens in TA ; they can find their bearings only within their own framework ( TB ). The YESHSUT contains all information. As regards YESHSUT cont ains all inf ormation. As r egar ds YESHSUT TA , it is in- terested in the further breaking.

After the breaking of the vessels, a special Reshimo in the Rosh de Atzilut prevents the light from spreading to the Guf . The Guf . The Guf Guf can be only Guf can be only Guf in the state of Vak . ומקבל , ולמטה מטבורו ק \" דא הכתר פרצוף על מלביש דאצילות עתיק שפרצוף : באופן ( קנז מטבור מלביש דאצילות א \" א ופרצוף , שם אשר ק \" דא הכתר דפרצוף ה \" מ מקומת שפעו דאצילות א \" ואו . שם אשר ק \" דא ב \" דע ה \" מ מקומת שפעו ומקבל , ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ולמטה . שם אשר ג \" דס ה \" מ מקומת שפעם ומקבלים , ק \" דא ג \" ס דפרצוף ולמטה מטבור מלבישים ה \" מ מקומת שפעם ומקבלים , ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ דפרצוף ולמטה מטבור מלבישים דאצילות ן \" זו רק , ק \" בא שכנגדו מפרצוף מקבל אינו אצילות פ \" מה פרצוף שכל הרי . ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ דפרצוף . ה \" מ קומת הנקרא , ראש בלי ק \" ו בחינת בהמוחין רק מתחשבים אנו מקום מכל , ר \" ג בחינת אצילות פ \" דה בראשים שיש פ \" ואע .( ט \" קל אות ) ראש בלי ק \" ו רק שהוא , שלהם לגופים ולמטה מפה המתפשטים 157) Atik de Atzilut receives the light from MA de Galgalta, i.e., dresses upon it from the Tabur to Yesod. The Partzuf Arich Anpin (AA) de Atzilut dresses onto the Partzuf AB from the Tabur and below and receives the light from MA de AB. The Partzuf Abba ve Ima de Atzilut dresses onto SAG de AK from the Tabur and below and receives the light from MA. ZON de Atzilut dresses onto the Partzufim MA and BON of the world of AK and receive the light on this level. Thus, each Partzuf of the world of Atzilut receives light from the corresponding Partzuf de AK on the level of its Vak bli Rosh from the Tabur to Yesod, i.e., on the level of the MA de AK. However, it does not completely dress onto the corresponding Partzuf of the world of Adam Kadmon. Despite the fact that the level of Ohr Hochma in the Rashim de Atzilut reaches the Gar, we take into account only that level of Ho- chma, which spreads from the Peh de Rosh to the Guf, i.e., the Vak bli Rosh or ZA."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 441 The Universe consists of five worlds, that in turn include five Partzufim ; each of them is divided into five parts in accordance with the degree of its Aviut . Starting with TB , each Partzuf has three states: Partzuf has thr ee s t at es: Partzuf Ibur , Yenika, and Mochin , one inside the other. The AHP of the upper AHP of the upper AHP Partzuf is inside the GE of the lower one. Keter of the lower Keter of the lo w er Keter Partzuf can receive Partzuf can r eceiv e Partzuf the light only from Malchut of the upper. Each Partzuf dresses onto the previous one from its Partzuf dr esses ont o the pr evious one fr om its Partzuf Peh downwards as in TB. However, the Partzufim built according to TB have laws of their own. Everything depends on what function needs to be expressed. Be- sides, all the Ketarim are interconnected and so are Hochmot , etc. Hochma of the lower Partzuf cannot receive the light from Partzuf canno t r eceiv e the light fr om Partzuf ZA or Bina of the up- per. Hochma receives from Hochma throughout the entire chain. Both overall and in particular, everything submits to the law of the similarity of properties. Man starts attaining this entire intricate system only when he ac- quires the vessels corresponding to it. He becomes its integral part, can influence it, and is affected by it constantly. , אפשר אי זה כי . ק \" בא שכנגדו הבחינה על אחד כל מלבישים אצילות פ \" שה הכונה ואין ( קנח פרצוף כל שקומת , היא הכונה אלא . אצילות פ \" ה וכן . זה על זה מלבישים ק \" א פ \" ה שהרי , אילן ) שפעו מקבל שמשם , ק \" א פ \" שבה שכנגדו הבחינה לעומת מכוונת אצילות מפרצופי .(' ג ציור 158) This does not mean that each of the five Partzufim de Atzilut dresses onto the corresponding Behina in the world of AK. This is im- possible, because the five Partzufim de AK dress one onto the other. The same happens to the five Partzufim de Atzilut. It means that the level of each Partzuf de Atzilut correlates with the level corresponding to it in the five Partzufim de AK and receives its light from there. Now let us look at Diagram 3 in “Sefer haIlan” (The Book of the Tree) and the brief comment to it. It shows the permanent state of the five Partzufim de AK , from which the five Partzufim de MA Hadash (or Atzi-"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 442 lut ) emerged in their permanency. Since they are the vessels of bestowal, no diminution ever happens in them, only Gadlut . The book also examines the division of each Partzuf into Partzuf int o Partzuf Keter and Keter and Keter ABYA , which are alternatively called Keter , AB , SAG , MA and BON or BON or BON Yechida , Haya , Neshama , Ruach and Nefesh . Each Rosh down to its Peh is called Keter or Keter or Keter Yechida . The distance from the Peh to the Chazeh in each of them is called Atzilut , AB or Haya ; from the Chazeh to the Tabur – Tabur – Tabur Be- ria , SAG or Neshama ; below the Tabur – Tabur – Tabur Yetzira and Assiya , MA and BON, or Ruach and Nefesh . Now let us look at the order in which the Partzufim dress one onto the other. Each lower Partzuf dresses onto the upper from the Partzuf dr esses ont o the upper fr om the Partzuf Peh and below according to the following law: the Rosh of each lower Partzuf dresses onto the AB – Atzilut of the upper , AB – Atzilut of the lower – on the SAG – Beria of the upper; SAG - Beria of the lower – on the MA and the BON ( BON ( BON Yetzira and Assiya ) of the upper. Thus, the Peh of the upper Partzuf is the level of Partzuf is the lev el of Partzuf Galgalta of the lower; the Chazeh of the upper serves the Peh of the lower; the Tabur of Tabur of Tabur the upper is the Chazeh of the lower. The emergence of MA Hadash be- comes clear in each of the five Partzufim de Atzilut and in the correspond- ing Partzuf de AK .

Only then can they receive an"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 443 increase to the 10 Sefirot of the second kind sufficient for the Gufim. MAN is raised in three stages. First, MAN, on Aviut Bet, gives birth to the 10 Sefirot de Bina, i.e., the SAG in Gadlut with the light of Neshama. Then MAN on Aviut Gimel creates the 10 Sefirot de Hochma, i.e., AB with the Mochin de Haya. When MAN is raised for the third time on Aviut Dalet, 10 Sefirot emerge on the level of Keter or Galgalta with Mo- chin de Yechida. The light coming from above as a result of raised MAN increases MAN incr eases MAN the lower Partzufim to 10 Sefirot and provides them with enough strength to create a screen on their uncorrected properties and pass from the state of Katnut to Gadlut by using the second method, i.e., by adding AHP to AHP t o AHP GE in order to form the 10 Sefirot . The light that enters a Partzuf depends on the Partzuf depends on the Partzuf Aviut de Masach , on the desire the Partzuf may use. Indeed, the amount of light that a Partzuf ma y use. Indeed, the amount of light that a Partzuf Partzuf can absorb is equal to the degree to which it is willing to use the light for the Creator’s sake. As soon as something changes in one of the Partzufim , all the oth- ers are instantly transformed, for all of them are interrelated and inter- connected. If man makes even a tiny correction, he immediately gener- ates a tremendous light in all the Partzufim and the worlds. This is how important man’s role is in changing the state of the world. Each element of the creation feels exactly what all others feel. After the disappearance of the light, the Reshimot remain in the screen, which then rises to the Rosh and asks for strength in accordance with those Reshimot . After the breaking of the vessels in the world of Ni- kudim, the screen with all the Reshimot ascends, eager to be filled again, and wills to acquire the new power of intention. Each consecutive level may be born only after the complete emer- gence of the previous one, i.e., the Partzuf Arich Anpin may not be born be-"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 444 fore Atik is fully formed. The Rosh de SAG analyses the Reshimot Dalet-Gimel and gives birth to Atik . Behinat Hochma cannot emerge before it is born. After the Rosh de SAG fills Atik and brings it to the state of Gadlut , it passes to Atik all the Reshimot it had in order for Atik to select the small- est of them. Therefore, Atik chooses MAN (a screen) and the MAN (a scr een) and the MAN Reshimot de Behinat Hochma . Then, after the formation of Katnut and Gadlut in AA , it receives all the Reshimot and selects the smallest for Behinat Bina . Now that AA has Gadlut de Neshama , it can give birth to Katnut de Abba ve Ima (AVI) in the place of Bina de Atzilut (Bina de MA) . In order to give the AHP de AVI strength to receive the light “for the sake of the Creator”, a Zivug AB-SAG must be made. This light descends from SAG under the Tabur through Tabur thr ough Tabur all the Partzufim de Atzilut to the relevant place. כלולים שכבר , דצדיקים ן \" נר בחינת רק הם , ן \" מ להעלות הראוים שהתחתונים ודע ( קס ן \" הזו ואז . שלהם העליון לבחינת הנחשבים , דאצילות ן \" לזו ן \" מ להעלות ויכולים , ע \" מבי . ק \" א לפרצופי שמגיעים עד , למעלה יותר א \" ואו . א \" או שהם , שלהם העליון אל ן \" מ מעלים פ \" ע ס \" ע קומת ויוצאות . שמה שנתעלו ן \" המ על ק \" א לפרצופי ה \" ב ס \" מא העליון אור יורד ואז קומת הוא ג \" מבחי אם , נשמה קומת הוא ב \" מבחי הוא אם : שהעלו ן \" המ של העביות מדת .' וכו חיה וכן . אצילות לפרצופי שבאים עד , ק \" א פרצופי דרך למדרגה ממדרגה המוחין יורדים ומשם משפיעים שהם , דאצילות ן \" להזו שבאים עד , אצילות פרצופי כל דרך למדרגה ממדרגה עוברים מוחין חידוש שכל , הכלל וזה . ע \" מבי הללו ן \" המ את שהעלו , דצדיקים ן \" הנר אל האלו המוחין מהעליון רק , שפע לקבל או ן \" מ להעלות יכולה מדרגה ואין . לבדו ה \" ב ס \" מא רק אלא בא אינו . לו הסמוך 160) The lower Partzufim that must raise MAN are the human souls (the “NaRaN de Tzadikim”), already included in the worlds of BYA and capable of raising MAN to the ZON de Atzilut, which in turn raise MAN to their own upper Partzufim: Arich Anpin, Abba ve Ima and above, until they reach the Partzufim de AK. Then, in response to MAN, the upper light descends from the World of Infinity to AK. The 10 Sefirot emerge according to the Aviut de MAN present there. If it is Behina Bet, it corresponds to the level"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 445 of Neshama, Behina Gimel equals the level of Haya, and Behina Dalet attracts the light of Yechida. Gradually, the Mochin descends from the same level through Partzu- fim de AK to the Partzufim de Atzilut, until it reaches ZON de Atzilut. With the help of the Mochin, ZON de Atzilut compel the NaRaN de Tzadikim to raise MAN from BYA. The general rule states that each new Mochin comes directly from the World of Infin- ity. No level can raise MAN or receive the light of Hochma without the upper Partzuf closest to it. The place of Atzilut is between the Tabur de AK to the Tabur de AK t o the Tabur de AK Parsa . The worlds of BYA with the uncorrected souls are under the Parsa . If by cer- tain actions these souls can receive strength for the correction of ZON de Atzilut , they elevate their request higher, to Rosh de Galgalta of the world of AK , which is in contact with the World of Infinity and draws the up- per light in order to pass it on to BYA . The light spreading from above is many times more powerful than was requested by the worlds of BYA , but while descending and passing through all the Partzufim and the worlds, it diminishes to the size of the request, so as not to harm the requestor. Wherever the Partzuf might be, it feels only the one standing right Partzuf might be, it f eels only the one s t anding right Partzuf above it. Its request is turned only to the upper Partzuf and not to the one Partzuf and no t t o the one Partzuf several levels higher. In accordance with the accomplished correction and the acquired screen, its level will change, but the Partzuf will always Partzuf will alw a y s Partzuf address the one at its immediate, upper level. The soul’s correction begins in our world. Man of this world, a two-legged, albuminous creature, receives a signal from above and starts looking for something he cannot yet understand. Nevertheless, if he finds a Teacher, a group and books, then by persistent studies, together with other members of the group, and guided by the Teacher, a student can achieve the state of Ibur in the lowest spiritual Ibur in the lo w es t spiritual Ibur Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 446 Then his vessels of bestowal (the GE ) will be gradually born. Such a state is called Katnut . The emergence of GE marks the appearance of man’s inner world of Atzilut with Aviut Shoresh and Aleph . The continuation of studies generates in him a desire to turn to the upper level with a request for the vessels of reception, i.e., for Gadlut, in order to receive by way of bestowal. However, as we know, the ves- sels of reception were restricted by TB . The world of Nikudim wanted to receive them and was broken. So was Adam haRishon when it wished to work with them. So how can they possibly be received? It can be done only with the help of the AHP de Aliyah . Man asks for strength to work with the vessels of reception without the risk of breaking them. If man asks for the mea- sure of correction his vessels are ready for, and if he knows exactly what he needs, a spiritual force comes to him and answers his request. If he previously had the GE with Aviut Shoresh/Aleph , now man starts working with the AHP , perhaps, of Aviut Bet . He passes the level of Katnut and receives the first level of Gadlut (the Behina Bet ), and ascends for the first time. By further efforts, he gains more strength to work with Aviut Gimel and rises again. At last, he acquires the vessels of reception of the level Dalet and ascends for a third time to full Gadlut . When man has GE , he is on the level of ZON de Atzilut . The first time in Gadlut, he rises to the level of YESHSUT , the second time – to Abba ve Ima de Atzilut , the third time – to AA de Atzilut , i.e., completely dresses onto ZON de Nekudim (broken) and corrects them. So, by his own efforts, man returns to his spiritual root, receives the entire spiritual light. The Tzadikim are souls in a certain spiritual state in the worlds of BYA that are willing to justify the Creator’s actions. Our only task is to achieve the level of the Tzadik Gamur (absolutely righteous), when all Tzadik Gamur (absolut ely right eous), when all Tzadik Gamur the Creator’s actions are revealed to man. Seeing that all His actions are right and just, man calls Him the Righteous One. Hence, he himself is called a righteous man. If the Creator’s actions are partially or complete-"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 447 ly concealed from man, he is called a partially righteous man, a partial or complete sinner. Our state and name depend only on the extent of the Creator’s revelation. Our desires and properties will change accordingly. Why is a soul called Neshama ? The reason is that it is the most powerful light our soul can receive. The world of Adam Kadmon consists of five Partzufim , since the Creator affects all the five parts of Malchut . ZON de Atzilut is the uppermost Partzuf for all worlds of Partzuf f or all w orlds of Partzuf BYA , the inclusion of all that is found under the Parsa and below. Any MAN first MAN f ir s t MAN rises to the Gar of Gar of Gar ZON de Atzilut. However, ZON cannot answer the ZON canno t answ er the ZON request of the worlds of BYA . The light of correction or the light filling the vessel with delight can come from above only. The light that the Partzufim enjoyed before the breaking is different from that which corrects and fills them. This speaks about how delighted I am while delighting the Creator. Hence, such light descends from the World of Infinity; it cannot be in ZON de Atzilut . Any spiritual movement is altruistic. The upper Partzuf cannot Partzuf canno t Partzuf possibly give the lower something that may harm it. The next Partzuf is Partzuf is Partzuf always a natural continuation of the development (desires, thoughts) of the previous one. Galgalta completely exhausted all its resources. It can do no more for the Creator. Therefore, a new opportunity springs up: to accept some more light on a smaller Aviut , i.e., on the level of AB , which continues what Galgalta began doing. After (below) the world of Atzilut, the first seven Sefirot from the Parsa to the Chazeh de Beria (70 Amah ) are still somehow connected with Atzilut . Then the full 10 Sefirot from the Chazeh de Beria to the Chazeh de Yetzira (2000 Amah ) may still be used on Shabbat , when the Partzufim rise to Atzilut . We see that the passage from Chazeh de Yetzira to Chazeh de Beria is much more difficult than from the Parsa to the Chazeh de Beria . Naturally, these estimates are relative."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 448 על שיתגדלו מטרם , דאצילות ן \" מהזו משהו יקבלו שהתחתונים אפשר שאי , תדע ומכאן ( קסא מוחין חידוש שאין , נתבאר כי . ק \" הא ועולם האצילות דעולם העליונים הפרצופים כל ידיהם שהם , להם הסמוך מהעליון אלא לקבלם יכולים דצדיקים ן \" הנר אין אמנם . ה \" ב ס \" מא אלא . דאצילות ן \" זו אל שמגיעים עד , העליונים והפרצופים העולמות דרך להשתלשל המוחין צריכים ולפיכך ממקום העברה וענין . ברוחני העדר שאין , ידעת וכבר . דצדיקים ן \" לנר המשפיעים שהם , ן \" הזו שנשארים אלא , בגשמיים כנוהג ,' הב למקום ובאים ' הא ממקום שנעדרים הפירוש אין , למקום . חסר חברו ואין מנר נר מדליק כמו ,' הב למקום ובאו שעברו אחר גם ,' הא במקום בחינת רק נמשך ' הב ובמקום ,' הא במקום נשאר האור ושורש שעיקר , הכלל זה אלא , עוד ולא , דצדיקים ן \" לנר שמגיע עד העליונים דרך העובר השפע שאותו , תבין זה ועם . ממנו ענף שהם , השפע בסבת מתגדלות המדרגות כל ונמצאות . דרכה שעבר ומדרגה מדרגה בכל נשאר . דצדיקים ן \" נר לצורך מעבירים 161) You should know that the lower Partzufim cannot receive the light from ZON de Atzilut before all the upper Partzufim de Atzilut and AK acquire Gadlut. The new Mochin descends only from the World of Infinity. However, the NaRaN de Tzadikim can receive the Mochin only from the previous Partzuf, i.e., from ZON de Atzilut. Hence, the Mochin must descend and spread through all the Partzufim located above ZON de Atzilut, until it reaches it. Only after that, will the Mochin pass on to NaRaN de Tzadikim in the worlds of BYA. We already know that nothing ever disappears in the spiritual realm. Contrary to what happens in our world, a spiritual object passing from one place to another continues to remain in its initial position. This can be compared to lighting one candle from another. As the first candle passes the fire to the next, it continues to remain alight. The rule holds that the primary light (the root) stays in place while the branch changes its position. Now you will understand that the same light that descends via all the upper worlds and reaches NaRaN de Tzadikim remains on each level it passes through. All the levels receive more light owing to the fact that they have to pass it to NaRaN de Tzadikim."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 449 Tiny man’s diminutive work below generates a tremendous light in all the worlds.

If their actions are correct, they raise MAN and attract the light. Then all the levels it passes through grow and rise. When their actions deteriorate, so does MAN; Mochin disappears from the lev- els, the upper worlds stop passing light to the lower; so, they descend to their initial permanent (minimal) state. Nothing disappears; whatever was before continues to exist. As- cents and descents of the worlds are determined only as regards the souls, which by aggravating their actions, lower the worlds; however, by doing good deeds, they contribute to the ascent of the worlds. All that happens in the worlds makes for correction and the ap- proach of the Gmar Tikkun . Every thought, every event, and every action is just one more step towards correction. What does it mean that a soul is spoiled? It worked on itself, to make a spiritual action, to rise and merge with the Creator on some level. It raised MAN , received the light and strength to ascend. Once the new level is achieved, the soul cannot remain motionless. To make it move, more egoism, for which it does not yet have a screen, is added to the soul. Affected by this load, it falls and deterio- rates. Each fall is necessary for regaining powers, rising higher and, con- sequently, receiving another portion of egoism. Thus, all initially egoistic desires are gradually transformed into altruistic ones."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 450 The Baal HaSulam gives the following example. A king, who want- ed to move from one capital to another, did not know how to transfer all his treasures without being robbed. Hence, he dispensed a gold coin to each of his subjects. The king could trust them with that amount. Thus, by small portions, he was able to transfer his entire wealth. This example hints at the correction of the general egoism by way of dividing it into small parts that are then transferred to the world of Atzilut . There, they will again merge into one common vessel, one single soul. ן \" וזו ת \" לישסו ע \" בי העולמות ' וג , ק \" א פ \" לה אצילות פ \" ה עליות סדר נבאר ועתה ( קסג גמר מטרם שני אלפי בהשתא להיות שאפשר להגובה עד , הקבוע ממצבם החל . דאצילות . מרובים לפרטים מתחלקות הן אמנם . עליות ' ג רק הן כלל שבדרך . התיקון לאחר הנאצל הראשון פרצוף כי , לעיל נתבאר כבר בקביעות ע \" ואבי ק \" א העולמות מצב והנה . ן \" וב ה \" מ ג \" ס ב \" ע : ק \" א פרצופי ' ד מלבישים שעליו , ק \" דא גלגלתא פרצוף הוא ,' א צמצום ק \" דא המקיפים מסבבים ועליו .( א \" ל , ז \" כ אות ) ז \" העוה מנקודת למעלה הוא ק \" א רגלי וסיום הוא כן , לו מסביב מקיף ה \" ב ס \" שא וכמו .( ב \" ל אות ) ושיעור קץ אין שלגדלם , ה \" ב ס \" מא . ה \" ב ס \" א קו המכונה והוא . בפנימיותו מתלבש 163) Now we will clear up the way the five Partzufim de Atzilut rise to the five Partzufim de AK. We will also clarify the ascent of the three worlds of BYA to YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, starting with their minimal state (Katnut), up to the ultimate state that will be achieved by the end of a 6000-year period, in the Gmar Tikkun. Usually we speak about three main ascents that are divided into many special ones. We know that the first Partzuf in the world of AK after TA was Galgalta. The four following Partzufim de AK dressed on it: AB, SAG, MA and BON. Sium Ragley de AK is above the point of our world. Galgalta is surrounded with the light of Infinity on all sides. This light is limitless and its magnificence is indescribable. The part of this light that enters Galgalta is called a line, or the Inner Light. אות ) ק \" דא ג \" דס נקודות המכונה , ק \" דא מ \" תנהי פרצוף יש ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ ובפנימיות ( קסד וקבעה , ז \" דעוה לנקודה ממעל שעמדה , המסיימת מלכות עלתה ' הב צמצום שבעת .( ו \" ס , ג \" ס"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 451 אור על חדש סיום שם ונעשה . שלו ת \" דת עליון שליש מתחת , הזה דפרצוף בהחזה מקומה \" האצילות שמתחת פרסא \" בשם נקרא הזה חדש וסיום . ולמטה משם יתפשט שלא , העליון .( ח \" ס אות ) נעשו , הפרסא מתחת שנשארו , ק \" דא ג \" דס נקודות דפרצוף ולמטה שמחזה הספירות ואלו מקום נעשו י \" ונה , הבריאה לעולם מקום נעשה , החזה עד ת \" ת ש \" ב : ע \" בי העולמות ' לג מקום העולמות ' ג שמקום ונמצא .( ז \" ס אות ) העשיה לעולם מקום נעשה והמלכות היצירה לעולם . ז \" דעוה לנקודה ממעל ומסתיים הפרסא מתחת מתחיל ע \" בי 164) There is a Partzuf called TNHYM de AK inside Partzufim MA and BON de AK. It is also defined as Nekudot de SAG de AK. During TB, Malchut Mesayemet, which was above the point of our world, rose to Tifferet and set a place in the Chazeh of this Partzuf below the upper third of Tifferet. A new Sium on the upper light (un- able to spread lower) was formed there. This Sium was named Parsa under the world of Atzilut. The Sefirot of the Partzuf Nekudot de SAG, which remained under the Parsa, formed a place for the the worlds of BYA in the following order: the lower two thirds of Tifferet down to Chazeh prepared a place for the world of Beria. Netzah, Hod, and Yesod prepared a place for the world of Yetzira. Malchut formed a place for the world of Assiya. Thus, the location of the three worlds of BYA begins from the Parsa and ends with the point of our world. The Parsa , Tifferet, is called “Bina de Gufa” . Affected by the Tzim- tzum (restriction), it finds itself under the Gar (Gimel Rishonot) de Bina . One should remember that the Guf of the Partzuf (Tifferet) is divided into three parts: the upper third of Tifferet – the HaBaD , the middle third of Tifferet – the HaGaT and the lower third of HaGaT and the lo w er thir d of HaGaT Tifferet – the NHY . Malchut rises to the level under the Gar de Bina to a place called “ the Chazeh” . The law of TB rules from here downwards and the Parsa is formed under the world of Atzilut . מטבור למטה ממקום שמתחילים . ועשיה יצירה , בריאה , אצילות העולמות ' ד ונמצאים ( קסה שלמטה ממקום מתחילים האצילות עולם פ \" ה כי . ז \" העוה לנקודת ממעל ומסתיימים ק \" דא"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 452 העולמות ' ג עומדים ז \" לעוה עד ולמטה מהפרסא . להפרסא ממעל ומסתיימים ק \" דא מטבור . מיעוט שום בהם יארע לא שלעולם , ע \" ואבי ק \" א העולמות של הקבוע מצב וזהו . ע \" בי בלי ק \" ו בחינת רק אלא והעולמות הפרצופים בכל אין הזה שבמצב ,( ח \" קל אות ) נתבאר וכבר אינן מקום מכל , שלהם בראשים ר \" ג שיש , דאצילות הראשונים הפרצופים ' בג אפילו כי . ראש ואפילו . ע \" בי בפרצופי ש \" וכ . ראש בלי ק \" ו הם הגופים וכל . שלהם ולמטה מפה מושפעות .( ב \" ל אות ) ר \" ג חסרי שהם כ \" ג נבחנים , שלו המקיפים בערך , ק \" א פרצופי 165) The four worlds, Atzilut, Beria, Yetzira and Assiya, are located between the Tabur and the point of our world. The world of Atzilut is between the Tabur de AK and Parsa. The place for the worlds of BYA was formed between the Parsa and the point of our world. The state of the worlds of AK and ABYA is now permanent, and there will never be any diminution in them. All the Partzufim and the worlds in this state have only the level of Vak bli Rosh. In addition, even if Gar is in the Rashim of the first three Partzufim de Atzilut, the light cannot spread below the Peh, and all their Gufim are in the state of Vak bli Rosh. The same state is present in the worlds of BYA. Even in the Partzufim de AK, Gar is considered to be absent as regards the Surrounding Light (the Ohr Makif). The Gar represents the Gar r epr esents the Gar Rosh and the genuine light of Hochma , while Vak represents Ohr Hassadim with a spark of Ohr Hochma . So what happens in the world of Atzilut ? Let us begin our explana- tion with Galgalta . Galgalta receives light from the World of Infinity. We know there is an inverse relation between the lights and the vessels. The coarser the vessel, the larger screen it may use, the more powerful light it can receive. Vice versa: the smaller the vessel, the weaker the screen it has and the less light it will receive. Everything depends on how the lowest spiritual objects, the souls, will demand powers for the correction of their egoism. Until they are completely corrected, Galgalta , AB and SAG are filled with only the smallest light."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 453 First, the light of Nefesh enters the Kli Keter . As the Kli Hochma ap- pears, Ohr Nefesh passes to it, and Ohr Ruach enters Keter and so on, until Keter and so on, until Keter Malchut, the largest vessel, is activated.Then the most powerful light of Yechida fills Keter . We see that for the reception of the uppermost light, the most egoistic vessel – Malchut – must start acting to build a screen. Malchut de Malchut of the world of Infinity is forbidden (unable) to work with until Gmar Tikkun . Man is unable to correct or fill it with the true light of Hochma before the Mashiach comes. Hence, the Gar (the Gar (the Gar true light of Hochma ) is absent in the Partzufim Galgalta , AB and SAG . It appears only when Malchut is used. The breaking of the vessels demonstrated that it is impossible to work with the vessels of reception; they may be gradually included into the altruistic vessels – the AHP de Aliyah . It means that the light of Ho- chma in its entirety and perfection cannot enter the vessel until its final correction – the Gmar Tikkun . As was mentioned numerously, after TB only the Kelim de GE (filled with the light of Hassadim ) and the Kelim de AHP (receiving no Kelim de AHP (r eceiving no Kelim de AHP light at all) included in the GE may be worked with. However, since they are still egoistic, by virtue of their nature, the AHP automatically attract AHP aut omatically attr act AHP the luminescence of Hochma , i.e., they have Vak de Hochma or Vak bli Rosh , but not the Gar . All the laws of the world of Atzilut are created to allow no spread- ing of the powerful light below. There is Ohr Hochma in the Rashim de Partzufim of the world of Atzilut , but only a small part of it spreads below. If the Rosh has the Gar , only the Vak of this light spreads to the Gufim . AB-SAG is not the light of pleasure. It descends to correct the ves- sels, to impart an altruistic intention to its desires. We have no control over our desires; they are given by the Creator. They may only be given an altruistic intention. Suppose, I would like a cup of coffee. I cannot change this desire. However, I can drink it, because either I want to receive pleasure, or I can do it for the sake of pleasing the Creator. This"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 454 happens only when I feel Him and understand that He gives me, so I wish to return the delight to Him. For this, I must feel the Giver. The light AB-SAG descends in order to correct a desire or, rather, impart an altruistic intention to it. Man starts revealing the Creator, whose greatness and magnificence he begins to feel. Then man is ready to do everything for His sake. The importance and greatness of spirituality are far above the level of our pleasures; hence, they give us strength to do ev- erything for the Creator. In our world, upon seeing someone outstanding and important, we agree, with pleasure, to do everything for that person. , יחידה חיה נשמה הקומות ' בג העולמות להשלים בכדי , כוללות עליות ' ג נוהגות ולפיכך ( קסו בעת , היא ' הא העליה . התחתונים של ן \" מ בהעלאת תלויות האלו ועליות . להם החסרות ונשמה בינה דקומת פ \" האח נבררים שאז . ב \" דבחי העביות מבחינת ן \" מ מעלים שהתחתונים המוחין אשר .( ה \" קל אות ) השורק נקודת מהארת דהיינו .' הב דמין ס \" הע השלמת מבחינת דראשי ס \" בע שיש הכמות שכל , ק \" א בפרצופי כמו . והגופים ת \" הז לבחינת גם מאירים האלו . לגופים גם ומתפשטת עוברת , ק \" א פרצופי 166) There are three general ascents for supplementing the worlds with three levels: Neshama, Haya and Yechida. These ascents de- pend on the MAN raised by the lower objects. The first ascent is when MAN rises on the level of Aviut de Behina Bet. Then the AHP de Bina (Ohr Neshama) is corrected by its supplementation to 10 Sefirot of the second type, i.e., with the help of the luminescence of Shuruk. At that, the Mochin also shines onto the Zat and the Gufim, as in the Partzufim de AK, where all levels of the 10 Sefirot of the Rashim also spread in their Gufim. The worlds of ABYA do not use their genuine AHP . Nevertheless, each of these worlds receives light in its AHP and gradually fills with the AHP and gr adually f ills with the AHP entire light necessary for the end of correction, its ultimate state. How does it happen? First, all the Partzufim in addition to the GE ( Aviut Shoresh ( A viut Shor esh ( and Aleph ) also acquire the Awzen ( Aviut ( A viut ( Bet ). Then a force comes and helps to receive Bet de Aviut and the light of Neshama . However, since the AHP"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 455 de Aliyah (not their own AHP ) is used, hence the worlds ascend one level (the 10 Sefirot ). At last, the light that corrects Behina Dalet ( the Peh) comes, which leads to a third ascent of the worlds one level ( the 10 Sefirot) . In all, three ascents are necessary for the reception of all missing lights: Neshama , Haya, and Yechida . Accordingly, the entire five Partzufim de Atzilut dress onto the five Partzufim de AK : each Partzuf de Atzilut dresses from the Tabur downwards Tabur do wn w ar ds Tabur onto the corresponding upper Partzuf de AK . The part of the Partzuf from Partzuf fr om Partzuf the Tabur to the Tabur t o the Tabur Sium is called Vak . In its first ascent, the Partzuf in Partzuf in Partzuf Katnut ( Nefesh-Ruach, GE ) is supple- mented with the level of Neshama, SAG . Then it dresses onto the cor- responding part of the world of AK , from the Chazeh to Tabur , because Bina de Gufa ( SAG of each Partzuf ) is located there. Partzuf ) is locat ed ther e. Partzuf In its second ascent, each Partzuf dresses onto the corresponding Partzuf dr esses ont o the corr esponding Partzuf Partzuf of the world of Partzuf of the w orld of Partzuf AK , from the Peh to its Chazeh , i.e., on the level of Hochma, Haya, AB . In its third ascent, each Partzuf de Atzilut dresses onto the Rosh of the Rosh o f t h e Rosh corresponding Partzuf de AK and receives AK a n d r e c e i v e s AK Mochin (the light) de Yechida . Each Partzuf must dress onto the place where the Partzuf mus t dr ess ont o the place wher e the Partzuf Reshimot of the previous level of the Gufa de Galgalta shine. The Rosh de AB must dress, not on the Rosh de Galgalta , but from its Peh to the Chazeh , since the light must spread to where it disappeared, i.e., in the Chazeh de Galgalta, and not in its Rosh . The Rosh de Nekudim (YESHSUT) dresses onto the Rosh de Galgalta . Keter dresses onto the AB de AK, Abba ve Ima – onto SAG de AK . Each has to fill the Partzufim in AK . Since in the Gufim de Partzufim of the Gar de Atzilut in “Matzav haKavuah” (its initial state) there is just the light of Vak , only three ascents of the worlds of BYA are possible. When the lower Partzufim raise MAN , as if to request the strength to withstand our desires, to give us the properties of Bina that are in the"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 456 world of Beria , then the power may be received from the light of Shuruk , i.e., the light descending from Abba ve Ima Panim be Panim ; then one can start ascending spiritually. אצילות פ \" מה אחד כל מקבל , האצילות פרצופי דרך עוברים אלו שהמוחין בעת , ונמצא ( קסז כמו , שלהם לפרצופים גם ר \" ג המאירים , ג \" דס מוחין הנקרא , ונשמה דבינה מוחין בחינת המוחין מדת כפי , ק \" א פרצופי על ומלבישים ועולים מתגדלים שהם , אז נבחן כ \" וע . ק \" בא . שהשיגו 167) As the light passes through the world of Atzilut, each of this world’s five Partzufim receives the light of Bina, called Neshama, or Mochin de SAG, which shines upon the Partzufim de Atzilut in the manner they had in AK. They receive the light of Gadlut and dress onto the Partzufim de AK according to the level of the Mochin they possess. ומלביש עולה נמצא , דבינה האלו המוחין השיג דאצילות עתיק שפרצוף שבעת , באופן ( קסח בחינת משם מקבל והוא . ק \" דא גלגלתא דפרצוף ג \" ס קומת נגד המכוון , ק \" דא בינה לפרצוף . שלו ת \" להז גם המאירה , ק \" דא דיחידה נשמה המכוון , דקביעות דעתיק ראש על ומלביש עולה הוא , דאצילות א \" א לפרצוף באים וכשהמוחין ת \" לז המאירה , ק \" דא דחיה נשמה בחינת משם מקבל והוא . ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ג \" הס קומת נגד , דקביעות א \" דא ר \" לג ומלבישים עולים הם , דאצילות א \" או לפרצוף באים וכשהמוחין . שלו המאירה , ק \" דא דנשמה נשמה בחינת משם מקבלים והם . ק \" דא ג \" דס בינה קומת נגד המכוון . שלהם ת \" להז גם , דקביעות א \" או על ומלבישים עולים הם , דאצילות ן \" וזו ת \" לישסו באים האלו וכשהמוחין רוח דנפש נשמה בחינת משם ומקבלים . ק \" דא ן \" וב ה \" מ דפרצוף בינה קומת נגד המכוון לפרצופי באים וכשהמוחין . דאצילות דנשמה המוחין את דצדיקים ן \" הנר מקבלים ואז . ק \" דא נפש בחינת ממנה ומקבל . דאצילות הנוקבא את ומלביש הבריאה עולם עולה , הבריאה עולם . דאצילות ממנו ומקבל . דקביעות הבריאה לעולם ומלביש עולה הוא , היצירה לעולם המוחין וכשבאים עולם על ומלביש עולה הוא , העשיה לעולם באים וכשהמוחין . דבריאה ר \" וג נשמה בחינת פרצוף כל שהשיג ,' הא העליה נתבאר והנה . שביצירה ק \" דו מוחין בחינת משם ומקבל , היצירה .(' ז ציור , האילן ) . התחתונים שהעלו , ב \" דבחי ן \" המ בסבת , ע \" מאבי 168) As soon as Atik receives Mochin de Bina, it rises and dresses onto the Partzuf Bina of the world of AK, corresponding to the level"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 457 of SAG (Bina) de Galgalta of AK. There it receives Behinat Ne- shama de Yechida of the world of AK, which shines in its Guf. When the Mochin reaches Partzuf Arich Anpin de Atzilut, it rises and dresses onto the Rosh de Atik, corresponding to the level of the SAG of Partzuf AB de AK and receives Behinat Neshama de Haya de AK, which also shines in its Guf. When the Mochin reaches Partzuf Abba ve Ima, it rises by one level and dresses onto the Gar de Arich Anpin, corresponding to the level of Bina de SAG de AK. From there it receives the light of the Neshama de Neshama de AK that shines in its Zat. When the Mochin reaches YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, they rise and dress onto Abba ve Ima de Atzilut, corresponding to Behinat Bina of the Partzufim MA and BON de AK. From there they receive the light of Neshama de Nefesh-Ruach de AK.Then the NaRaN de Tzadikim receive the Mochin de Neshama of the world of Atzilut. When the Mochin reaches the Partzufim de Beria, this world rises and dresses onto Nukvah de Atzilut, receiving from it Be- hinat Nefesh de Atzilut. When the Mochin reaches the world of Yetzira, it rises and dresses onto the world of Beria, receiving Behinat Neshama and the Gar de Beria from it. Finally, as the Mochin reaches the world of Assiya, it rises and dresses onto the world of Yetzira, receiving from it Behinat Mochin de Vak de Yetzira. Thus, we have learned what each Partzuf received during the first ascent caused by MAN of the second type, raised by the souls in the worlds of BYA. We see how, influenced by the requests and prayers raised by the souls from the worlds of BYA , they ascend through all worlds to the Rosh de Galgalta . It makes a Zivug with the light of the World of Infinity and Zivug with the light of the W orld of Inf inity and Zivug receives it. Then the light passes through all the Partzufim of the worlds of AK and AK and AK ABYA, and reaches the soul that attracted this light, filling it. The soul and all worlds are in a state of ascent. The thread that ties this soul with the World of Infinity links it to the Creator. Nefesh and Ruach are two constant lights shining in the worlds. During the ascent, Neshama is added to them. Each Partzuf goes up one Partzuf goes up one Partzuf"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 458 level. The Rosh of the lower Partzuf reaches the Partzuf r eac hes the Partzuf Rosh of the upper, attain- ing all of its thoughts and calculations. Let us look at diagram 7 in the book “Sefer haIlan” . On diagram 3, we saw a minimal permanent state of the worlds of BYA . Diagram 7 shows the states of the worlds of BYA after the first ascent, when they received the light of Neshama . Let us note that the Rosh of each Partzuf dressed on the MA of the corresponding Partzuf de AK . The Rosh of each Partzuf de Atzilut dresses onto the SAG of the corresponding Partzuf de AK . Thus, the worlds of ABYA shifted one level up as compared to the previous state and the world of AK . Re- ceiving light from the World of Infinity, AK also rises. Here our goal AK a l s o r i s e s . H e r e o u r g o a l AK is to see the additional light received by the worlds of ABYA . We may say that, thanks to the souls’ request, all worlds received the light of Neshama and all vessels from the World of Infinity down to our world were filled with it. נבררים שאז , ג \" דבחי העביות מבחינת ן \" מ מעלין שהתחתונים בעת היא ' הב העליה ( קסט לבחינת גם מאירים אלו שמוחין .' הב דמין ס \" הע השלמת מבחינת , וחיה חכמה דקומת פ \" האח כל נמצא , ע \" דאבי הפרצופים דרך עוברים וכשהמוחין . ק \" א בפרצופי כמו , והגופים ת \" הז . שהשיג המוחין כפי ידיהם על ומתגדל עולה פרצוף 169) The second ascent took place as a result of the raising of MAN on Aviut de Behina Gimel, when the AHP de Hochma (Haya) is corrected. Gadlut and supplementation to 10 Sefirot of the second type take place as the Mochin shines in the Zat and the Gufin, as well as in the Partzufim AK. When the Mochin passes down through the worlds of BYA, each Partzuf affected by this light grows and ascends one more level. The additional filling with light is called an ascent. In fact, nothing ascends or descends in the spiritual world. It is necessary to have an ad- ditional vessel that can be created through a request sent from below. What other methods of correction and filling the vessels are avail- able? The light can come from above and temporarily arouse a craving"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 459 for spirituality. It corrects and sustains all the Partzufim and the souls in the worlds of BYA , filling them with scanty light. This happens on Rosh Hodesh , Shabbat and holidays. Depending on the light descending from above, we can know what these days and holidays are. The diversity is determined by the light, its kind. Hence, we have the time calendar, introduced by the Creator. The light comes from above, arouses the vessels, fills, and empties them. This light is not connected with the souls’ request. In accordance with the kind and intensity of the request, raised by the soul, it can ascend one, two, or three levels. The soul’s ascent through all three levels means it achieved the Gmar Tikkun. It corrected everything it could with the help of the AHP de Aliyah , i.e., included its own vessels into the vessels of bestowal and does not work with the Lev haEven that is corrected only with the arrival of the Mashiach . Thus, there are two kinds of the souls’ ascents. The first is stimu- lation from above; this is the work of the Creator, Who activates this most intricate mechanism called nature. The process is totally beyond our powers. The second kind includes a most thorough preparation for stimulation from below, surpassing the light’s influence from above, pay- ing no attention to it and rising independently. By this, the Klipot descend and cease to be parallel to the pure worlds. This prevents them from exerting a negative influence. That is why, having completed the three ascents to the world of Atzilut , the souls completely break away from the Klipot . Up to that time, there is an op- position between the pure and the impure worlds. Man needs to analyze his thoughts, intentions, and feelings carefully and try to separate the altruistic from the egoistic. , ק \" דא חכמה דפרצוף ר \" לג ומלביש עולה , דאצילות עתיק לפרצוף המוחין כשבאו , באופן ( קע החיה אור בחינת משם ומקבל . ק \" דא דגלגלתא ב \" ע קומת נגד המכוון , ק \" דא ב \" ע הנקרא , ק \" דא ג \" דס ר \" לג ומלביש עולה הוא , דאצילות א \" א לפרצוף מגיעים וכשהמוחין . דיחידה . ק \" דא דחיה החיה אור בחינת משם ומקבל . ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ב \" ע קומת נגד המכוונים"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 460 , דקביעות דעתיק ר \" לג ומלבישים עולים הם , דאצילות א \" או לפרצופי מגיעים וכשהמוחין , ק \" דא דנשמה החיה אור בחינת משם ומקבל . ק \" דא ג \" ס דפרצוף ב \" ע קומת נגד המכוונות ר \" לג ומלבישים עולים הם , דאצילות ת \" לישסו באים וכשהמוחין . והגופים ת \" להז גם המאירה . ק \" דא ה \" דמ החיה אור משם ומקבלות . ק \" דא ה \" דמ ב \" ע קומת נגד המכוונות , דקביעות א \" דא . ק \" דא ן \" דב ב \" ע קומת נגד המכוונים , א \" דאו ר \" לג עולים הם , דאצילות ן \" לזו באים וכשהמוחין וכשמגיעים . הצדיקים נשמת מקבלים ן \" ומהזו . ק \" דא ן \" דב החיה אור בחינת משם ומקבלים רוח בחינת ממנו ומקבל . דאצילות א \" הז על ומלביש עולה הוא , הבריאה לעולם המוחין . דאצילות ממנה ומקבל . דאצילות הנוקבא על ומלביש היצירה עולה , היצירה לעולם באים וכשהמוחין ומקבל הבריאה לעולם ומלביש עולה העשיה לעולם המוחין וכשבאים . דאצילות הנפש אור נתבאר והנה . ע \" דבי ן \" הנר בכל העשיה עולם נשלם ואז . דבריאה ונשמה ר \" ג בחינת ממנו ן \" הנר שהעלו , ג \" דבחי ן \" המ בסבת ונתגדלו שעלו , ע \" אבי מפרצופי פרצוף כל של ' הב העליה .(' ח ציור , האילן ) . דצדיקים 170) When the Mochin reaches Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, Atik rises and dresses onto Partzuf Hochma de AK, called AB.

Then the world of Assiya is filled with all lights of NaRaN de BYA. Thus, we have learned about the second ascent of each Partzuf de ABYA that rose and grew because NaRaN de Tzadikim had raised MAN de Behina Gimel. The second ascent is identical to the first. As regards the world of AK , which remains in its place, the worlds of ABYA ascend. From dia- gram 8 at the end of the book, we see how the Rosh of each Partzuf dresses Partzuf dr esses Partzuf onto the corresponding place of Partzuf AB de AK (not AK (no t AK SAG, as during the first ascent). Atik dresses onto AB de Galgalta, Arich Anpin – on AB de AB , Abba ve Ima – on AB de SAG , i.e., all of them receive the light of Hochma from AB . פ \" האח נבררים שאז . ד \" דבחי מעביות ן \" מ מעלים שהתחתונים בעת היא ' הג העליה ( קעא ת \" להז גם מאירים אלו המוחין אשר .' הב דמין ס \" הע השלמת מבחינת , ויחידה כתר דקומת פרצוף כל הרי , ע \" אבי פרצופי דרך עוברים אלו וכשהמוחין . ק \" א בפרצופי כמו , שלהם והגופים . ההם המוחין מדת כפי לעליונו ומלביש ומתגדל עולה 171) The third ascent of the worlds happens in response to MAN raised by the souls on Aviut Dalet. The AHP de Keter is corrected and the Partzuf receives the light Yechida by way of being supplemented to 10 Sefirot (second type). The Mochin also shines in its Zat and Gufim as it did in the Partzufim de AK. While passing through the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA, each of them grows, rises, and dresses onto the corresponding upper one, depending on the kind of light in it. The next paragraph describes the third ascent. From diagram 9, we may see how all the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA ascend one more level and receive the light Yechida . By this, all of the Partzufim de Atzilut dress onto the corresponding Partzufim de AK . Thus, all the worlds of ABYA that were on the level of GE (Keter-Hochma), with the help of the"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 462 three ascents, now acquired the vessels Bina , ZA and Malchut, and were- thus completely filled with light. During the first ascent, the world of Beria ascended above the Parsa up to the world of Atzilut . During the second ascent, Yetzira reached Atzi- lut , and during the third ascent, Assiya rose above the Parsa up to Atzilut . During the first ascent, the world of Assiya rose to the level of Yetzira ; during the second – to the level of Beria; and during the third - to the level of Atzilut . All the Reshimot that remained from the breaking of the vessels form a certain chain from the weakest to the mightiest, coarsest, from an easy correction to a more difficult one. Each cycle of correction of cer- tain souls is called a generation; they receive the light that corresponds to them from above. As the coarser souls descend, they require a more powerful light that leads to the considerable correction, both in the spiri- tual worlds and in ours. All of this continues until the Final Correction (Gmar Tikkun) comes. גלגלתא דפרצוף ר \" לג ומלביש עולה , דאצילות עתיק לפרצוף המוחין ביאת שבעת , באופן ( קעב , דאצילות א \" א לפרצוף מגיעים וכשהמוחין . דיחידה היחידה אור בחינת משם ומקבל . ק \" דא . ק \" דא דחיה היחידה אור משם ומקבל . ק \" דא ב \" ע דפרצוף ר \" להג ומלביש עולה ומקבלים . ק \" דא ג \" דס ר \" לג ומלבישים עולים הם , דאצילות א \" או לפרצוף מגיעים וכשהמוחין ומלבישים עולים הם , ת \" ישסו לפרצוף מגיעים וכשהמוחין . ק \" דא דנשמה היחידה אור משם , דאצילות ן \" לזו מגיעים וכשהמוחין . ק \" דא ה \" דמ היחידה אור משם ומקבלים . ק \" דא ה \" דמ ר \" לג מקבלים ואז . ק \" דא ן \" דב היחידה אור משם ומקבלים . ק \" דא ן \" דב ר \" לג ומלבישים עולים הם . דאצילות ן \" מהזו היחידה אור את דצדיקים ן \" הנר משם ומקבל . דאצילות ת \" ישסו לפרצוף ומלביש עולה , הבריאה לעולם מגיעים שהמוחין ובעת . דאצילות א \" ז לפרצוף ומלביש עולה , היצירה לעולם מגיעים וכשהמוחין . דאצילות נשמה לנוקבא ומלביש עולה , העשיה לעולם מגיעים וכשהמוחין . דאצילות רוח בחינת ממנו ומקבל .(' ט ציור , האילן ) . דאצילות הנפש אור בחינת ממנה ומקבל , דאצילות 172) When the Mochin comes to the Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, Atik rises and dresses onto the Gar de Galgalta de AK and receives the light of Yechida de Yechida.

When the Mochin reaches AVI, this Partzuf ascends to the Gar de SAG de AK and receives the light of Yechida de Neshama de AK. When the Partzuf YESHSUT receives the Mochin, it rises to the Gar de MA de AK and receives the light of Yechida de MA de AK. When the Mochin reaches ZON, the latter rise to the Gar de BON de AK and receive the light of Yechida de BON de AK. Then NaRaN de Tzadikim receive the light of Yechida from ZON de Atzilut. When the Mochin reaches Beria, this world rises to YESHSUT de Atzilut and receives the light of Neshama de Atzilut. The Mochin elevates the world of Yetzira to Partzuf ZA de Atzilut, receiving the light of Ruach de Atzilut. As the Mochin reaches Assiya, the world rises to Partzuf Nukva de Atzilut, receiving the light of Nefesh de Atzilut (see diagram 9 from “Sefer haIlan”). חיה נשמה הקומות ' בג אחד כל נשלמו , אצילות פ \" ה אשר ,' הג עליה בעת עתה ונמצא ( קעג פ \" ה את והלבישו עלו אצילות פ \" שה , ונבחן . הקביעות מבחינת להם חסרים שהיו , ק \" מא יחידה שהיה , ר \" הג בחינת קבלו דצדיקים ן \" הנר וגם . ק \" א בפרצופי שכנגדו להבחינה אחד כל , ק \" א הקביעות שמבחינת , דאצילות הפרסא מתחת נמצאים שהיו , ע \" בי העולמות ' ג וגם . להם חסר ועתה . שעליהם הפרסא מכח מחכמה הנפרשים , חסדים דאור ן \" נר בחינת אלא בהם היה לא החכמה שאור , דאצילות ן \" נר להם ויש , דאצילות ן \" וזו ת \" לישסו והלבישו , מפרסא למעלה עלו . שלהם בחסדים מאיר 173) It turns out that during the third ascent, each of the five Partzu- fim de Atzilut expanded at the expense of Neshama, Yechida and Haya de AK, by dressing onto the 5 corresponding Partzufim de AK. The NaRaN de Tzadikim and the worlds of BYA received the Gar as well and rose above the Parsa. Now the light of Hochma shines in their Hassadim. : הפרסא שמתחת ע \" בי לפרצופי רק בקביעות מלבישים דצדיקים ן \" שהנר , לדעת ויש ( קעד שהם שהגם , ונמצא . דבריאה ס \" לע והנשמה , דיצירה ס \" לע והרוח , דעשיה ס \" לע מלביש הנפש . עליהם שמלבישים , ע \" בי פרצופי דרך רק אליהם מגיע הוא ז \" עכ , דאצילות ן \" מזו מקבלים"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 464 עולמות שגם ונמצא . ע \" בי עולמות ' הג עליות עם בשוה עולים דצדיקים ן \" הנר שגם , באופן ן \" המ פ \" ע דהיינו , דצדיקים ן \" הנר של השפע קבלת מדת לפי אלא , מתגדלים אינם ע \" בי . ידיהם על הנבררים 174) One should know that the NaRaN de Tzadikim, (human souls living in the worlds of BYA) constantly dress only on the Partzufim of BYA, under the Parsa. Nefesh dresses onto the 10 Sefirot de As- siya, Ruach – on the 10 Sefirot de Yetzira, and Neshama – on the 10 Sefirot de Beria. Although the souls receive light from ZON de Atzilut, it comes to them through the worlds of BYA, onto which they dress. The NaRaN de Tzadikim rise together with the ascents of the three worlds of BYA. The worlds of BYA ascend in accordance with the reception of light by the NaRaN de Tzadikim, i.e., depending on the power of MAN raised by them. We mentioned the Partzuf Adam haRishon that was broken and whose vessels were mixed and are now in the worlds of BYA . According to the request raised by each of these fragments, the worlds of BYA be- come agitated and in turn arouse ZON de Atzilut . Then, it passes on to the Gar de Atzilut , and then to AK , which receives light from the World of Infinity, moving gradually, through all worlds, lowering it to the soul that raised its MAN . The soul rises to its individual correction in accor- dance with the light received by it. בחינת רק שבהם והפרצופים העולמות בכל אין , הקביעות שמבחינת , נתבאר והנה ( קעה הגם כי . ק \" ו בחינת אלא אינם דצדיקים ן \" הנר אפילו כי . בחינתו כפי אחד כל . ראש בלי ק \" ו עולם בערך ק \" ו בבחינת רק נחשבים אלו ר \" ג ז \" עכ , הבריאה מעולם דנשמה ר \" ג להם שיש . מחכמה הנפרשים , חסדים אור בחינת שהם מטעם . האצילות , לגופים מאירים שאינם כיון מקום מכל , שלהם בראשים ר \" ג שיש פ \" אע , אצילות פרצופי וכן אינם , ק \" ו מבחינת יותר שהם , לעולמות המגיעים המוחין וכל . ק \" ו לבחינת רק נחשבים הם . הצדיקים שמעלים ן \" המ י \" ע אלא . העליון למקום התחתון עלית דרך זולת , בפרצופים להתקבל יוכלו לא האלו המוחין אמנם הגופים כלפי מקום מכל ,' הב דמין ס \" הע השלמת לבחינת נחשבים שהם פ \" אע כי , מטעם והוא במקומם נשלמים שאינם דהיינו ,' הא דמין פ \" אח לבירורי נחשבים הם עוד עצמם ת \" והז .( ב \" קמ אות ) העליון במקום נמצאים כשהם רק אלא , עצמם"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 465 ומלבישים עולים שהם בעת זולת , ק \" דא יחידה חיה נשמה לקבל אצילות פ \" ה יוכלו לא ולפיכך . אותם ומלבישים עולים שהם בעת רק זולת , דאצילות ן \" נר לקבל יוכלו לא ע \" בי עולמות ' וג ן \" הנר וכן התפשטות להם שיש , ת \" להז השייכים ,' הב דמין פ \" האח אלו כי . דאצילות ן \" וזו ת \" לישסו ע \" בי עולמות ' שהג בעת ולפיכך . התיקון בגמר רק יתבררו לא , ת \" הז למקום , למטה ממעלה נשאר , ולמטה מפרסא הקבוע שמקומם , אז נמצא , דאצילות ן \" וזו ת \" לישסו ומלבישים עולים מחזה לבין , היצירה דעולם ולמעלה מחזה בין הפרש שם ויש . קדושה אור מכל לגמרי ריקן . שלו ולמטה .( ט \" קמ אות ) לקליפות רק הקבוע מקום הוא , היצירה דעולם ולמטה שמחזה , לעיל נתבאר כי ונתלבשו דקדושה דעשיה ס \" וע דקדושה דיצירה ת \" ד ירדו , ר \" אדה של חטאו פגם מסבת אלא שם אין , ולמעלה דיצירה שמחזה נמצא , לאצילות ע \" בי עליות , בעת ולפיכך .( ו \" קנ אות ) שם . שלהם המדור שם כי . קליפות שם יש , ולמטה דיצירה מחזה אבל . קליפות ולא קדושה לא 175) All the worlds and Partzufim that are in their usual permanent state have only the Vak bli Rosh. This means that each level uses only six of its upper Sefirot, filled with the 6 lower lights. Even the NaRaN de Tzadikim are no more than the Vak, in spite of the fact that they have the Gar de Neshama from the world of Beria. In com- parison with the world of Atzilut, these Gar are the Vak. The same may be said about Partzufim de Atzilut. Although there is the light of the Gar in their Rashim (heads), this light, nevertheless, does not spread to the Gufim; hence, these Partzufim are also con- sidered Vak. The use of the additional vessels (Sefirot), which leads to the reception of more light, takes place only as a result of MAN raised by the Tzadikim (i.e., human souls in the worlds of BYA). However, the reception of this light (the Mochin) is possible only through the rise of the lower Partzuf to the level of the upper. The upper Partzufim de Atzilut (AA, AVI and YESHSUT) are supple- mented to 10 Sefirot according to the second type (with their own AHP). However, the ZON are supplemented to 10 Sefirot according to the first type, i.e., by ascending to the level of the upper Partzuf with its AHP, and not theirs."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 466 This happens because the AHP de ZON de Atzilut are enormous desires to receive, similar to the Essence of Creation (Malchut de Malchut). These desires cannot be corrected before the Gmar Tik- kun. Hence, the five Partzufim of the world of Atzilut can receive the lights Neshama, Haya and Yechida only during their ascent to the corresponding Partzufim de AK. The worlds of BYA can also receive the lights Neshama, Haya, and Yechida during their ascent to YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut. Beria dresses onto YESHSUT, Yetzira – on ZA and Assiya – on Malchut (Nukva) de Atzilut. It turns out that during this ascent, the space from the Parsa and below (the place of BYA) becomes empty of any light. However, on the one hand, there is a difference between the 10 Sefirot of Beria and the 6 upper Sefirot of Yetzira, and on the other, all of the other Sefirot. Thus, 14 (out of 30) lower Sefirot of the place of BYA constitute a permanent location only for the Klipot (i.e.“desire to receive” the light for their own pleasure without a screen). Just because of Adam’s “sin”, the 14 lower Sefirot de BYA descended to this place. Previously, as we know, these worlds stood at least 14 Sefirot higher. Therefore, after the ascent of the worlds of BYA to Atzilut, there is absolutely “nothing” in the space between the Parsa to the Chazeh (chest) de Yetzira, neither the worlds of BYA, nor the Klipot; while the space from the Chazeh de Yetzira and below is taken by the Klipot. נמצאים אינם , התחתונים של ן \" מ י \" ע רק באים אינם ק \" ו מקומת היתירים שהמוחין ולפי ( קעו , מעשיהם מקלקלים שהם ובעת . התחתונים במעשי תלוים כי , בפרצופים בקביעות זה משום מכח שנתקנו , שבפרצופים דקביעות המוחין אמנם .( ב \" קס אות ) מסתלקים המוחין נמצאים ולכן . התחתונים י \" ע מתגדלים אינם שהרי , לעולם שינוי שום בהם יארע לא , עצמו המאציל . ידיהם על נפגמים אינם 176) Thus, the reception of the additional lights, Neshama, Haya, and Yechida, depends on MAN being raised by the lower Partzufim and, finally, on MAN being raised by the human souls (NaRaN de"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 467 Tzadikim). If something happens to the NaRaN de Tzadikim and, for some reason, they cannot raise MAN, the “additional” lights depart from all the Partzufim de ABYA. However, the permanent lights – Nefesh and Ruach, which fill the vessels Keter and Hochma in such states, never leave them. .( ל \" ק אות ) ב \" לע א \" ואו , דאצילות לכתר נבחן הוא ן \" דב א \" א הרי , לך יקשה ולא ( קעז כ \" וא . דנקודים ב \" דחו התחתונה מחצית הם א \" ואו , ן \" דב התחתונה הכתר מחצית הוא א \" א כי א \" דאו שכנגדם והבחינה , ק \" דא הכתר פרצוף להיות צריך היה ק \" בא א \" דא שכנגדו הבחינה שום להם שאין , נוקבין הן ן \" הב פרצופי כי , היא והתשובה . ק \" דא ב \" ע להיות צריך היה ק \" בא . להם משפיעים , ה \" המ פרצופי שהם , שהזכרים מה רק אלא , מעצמם קבלה , בהזכרים רק נבחנים , מהעליון מוחין השגת , שפירושם , שבהעליות ההבחנות אלו כל , ולפיכך , בלבד חכמה קומת רק אלא , כלום כתר מבחינת לו אין ה \" דמ א \" שא וכיון . ה \" המ פרצופי שהם נבחן כ \" ע .( ו \" קכ אות ) בלבד בינה קומת אלא , כלום חכמה מבחינת להם אין ה \" דמ א \" ואו רק מתיחס ק \" דא הכתר ופרצוף . א \" לאו ק \" דא ג \" וס , א \" לא ק \" דא ב \" ע : ק \" בא שכנגדם הבחינה . ה \" דמ כתר הקומת כל שלקח , בלבד לעתיק 177) As was already stated, there is MA on the right side of the world of Atzilut, i.e., its own vessels, and BON on the left side, i.e., the broken vessels of the world of Nikudim, which are corrected with the help of the vessels of MA de Atzilut. Do not think it strange that Arich Anpin de BON is considered Keter de Atzilut and Abba ve Ima – AB de Atzilut. Arich Anpin is the lower half of Keter de BON and Abba ve Ima is a lower half of Hochma and Bina de Nikudim. So, the Partzuf Keter de AK (Galgalta) must presumably correspond to AA de Atzilut. The fact is that all the Partzufim de BON are Nekevot, i.e., they have no opportunity of their own to receive; they can acquire only what the corresponding Partzufim de MA (Zeharim) give them. Hence, all the ascents happen only with the Zeharim (Partzufim de MA). Since no vessels of AA de MA correspond to Keter, but only to Hochma, and AVI de MA have only the vessels corresponding to Bina, the Partzuf AB de AK corresponds to AA and the Partzuf SAG"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 468 de AK corresponds to AVI. The Partzuf Keter de AK corresponds only to the Partzuf Atik, which took the entire level of Keter de MA. During Gadlut de Nikudim , the Rosh de YESHSUT rose to the Rosh de YESHSUT r ose t o the Rosh de YESHSUT Rosh de Galgalta ; the Rosh de Keter rose to Rosh de Keter r ose t o Rosh de Keter AB de AK ; while AVI rose to Rosh de SAG . During Gadlut de Nikudim , Abba ve Ima had the level of Keter . Then why is it said they had the level of Hochma and Bina ? The level of the 10 Sefirot of the Direct Light differs from that of Gadlut , since the phase of the Direct Light is the first point, called Keter . In the state of Katnut, GE de Keter was on its level, while its Katnut, GE de Keter w as on its lev el, while its Katnut, GE de Keter AHP were in AHP w er e in AHP GE de Abba ve Ima . Keter in Keter in Keter Gadlut had the level of Keter .

As we know, MAN raised by the NaRaN de Tzadikim caused an additional reception of light in all the higher Partzufim, which pass them the light from the World of Infinity, leav- ing a part of it for themselves, each according to its position, growing in size, ascending higher and higher. Each Partzuf rises to the level of the higher one, i.e., all the Partzufim ascend without changing the order of their positions. For example, when ZON move from their permanent position under the Tabur de AA, they rise one level higher, i.e., to the Chazeh de AA. However, AA simultaneously goes up one level, i.e., from the Peh de Atik to the Gar de Atik. Naturally, all of its Sefirot rise too. Its HaGaT reach the previous level of the Gar, while the Sefirot that were between the Chazeh and the Tabur rose to their place, etc. Thus, ZON are now on the level of the Tabur and below the Partzuf AA, i.e., their position remained unchanged (see diagram 4 in “Sefer haIlan”, where dur- ing the reception of the light of Neshama, ZON rose to the Gar de YESHSUT, located below the Peh de Abba ve Ima, positioned below the Chazeh de AA). However, all the Partzufim de Atzilut also ascended one level (see dia- gram 7 in “Sefer haIlan”) during the reception of the light of Neshama. Hence, ZON still happen to be dressed on the space below the Peh de YESHSUT, located below the Chazeh de AVI, positioned below the Tabur de AA. Without exception, the ascents of all the Partzufim oc- cur in a similar fashion (see diagrams 3 to 12 in “Sefer haIlan”). הקבוע במקום מדרגתם כל משאירים הם , הפרצופים עליות אחר שגם , לדעת יש גם ( קעט א \" דאו ר \" שהג שבעת , באופן .( ו \" צ אות ) ברוחני העדר אין כי . מתחילה שם שהיו במקום או ונמצאים . א \" דא ולמטה מפה הקבוע במקום א \" דאו ר \" הג נשארו עוד , א \" דא ר \" להג עולים אשר , ממש א \" דאו ר \" מהג מקבלים שהם , דעליה א \" דאו ת \" החג גבי על אז שעלו , ת \" הישסו . העליה מטרם שם היו"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 470 ר \" ג במקום העומדות , דעליה א \" דאו ר \" הג כי . ביחד מדרגות ' ג שם שיש שנבחן אלא , עוד ולא עתה נמצאים ששם , א \" דא ולמטה שמפה הקבוע למקומם משפיעות נמצאות , דקביעות א \" דא כל נבחנים ז \" ועד . אחד במקום אחת בבת מאירים ת \" וישסו א \" ואו א \" דא ר \" הג הרי . ת \" ישסו . העליות בעת ע \" ואבי ק \" דא הפרצופים ואת , הקבוע במצבם העליונים כלפי העליה ערך את , הפרצוף בעלית תמיד להבחין יש זה ומטעם תמצא ' ג בציור כי . באילן זה כל ועיין ) . כמותו אחת מדרגה עלו הם שגם , העליונים כלפי שלו ערך תמצא הקבועים אצילות פ \" ה של ערכם לפי א \" הז עליות ' וג . הקבוע במצבם הפרצופים מצב בציורים תמצא , הקבועים ק \" א פ \" ה של ערכם לפי , אצילות פ \" ה כל של עליות ' וג .' ו ,' ה ,' ד בציור .( ב \" וי , א \" י , י בהציורים תמצא , הקבוע ה \" ב ס \" א קו בערך , ק \" א פ \" ה כל של עליות ' וג .' ט ,' ח ,' ז 179) It should also be noted that, while ascending, all the Partzufim leave “traces” on all the previous levels. In other words, they both rise and stay in their places, for nothing disappears in the spiritual world. For example, although the Gar de AVI ascend to the level of the Gar de AA, they, at the same time, remain in their previous place – be- low the Peh de AA, where the YESHSUT now rose (to the HaGaT de AVI), received the same light that was received by HaGaT de AVI when they were in this place before the ascent. Thus, there are now three Partzufim on that level at the same time; the Gar de AVI (after the ascent) now take the permanent place of the Gar de AA, pass the light to their previous position – from the Peh de AA and below. Now that level is taken by YESHSUT, since the Gar de AA, AVI and YESHSUT simultaneously shine upon one place. So, all the Partzufim de AK and ABYA line up during the ascents. That is why, when the Partzuf rises, one must pay attention to the level of its ascent with regard to the permanent position of the higher Partzufim, their new places (see diagram 3 in “Sefer haIlan”, where the permanent positions of the Partzufim are shown. On diagrams 4, 5 and 6 we can see 3 ascents of ZA as regards the permanent location of the Partzufim de Atzilut. On diagrams 7, 8 and 9 we can see three ascents of the five Partzufim de Atzilut as regards the five Partzufim de AK. On diagrams 10, 11, and 12 we can see three ascents of the five Partzufim de Atzilut as regards the permanent position of the Line of Infinity)."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 471 T H E D I V I S I O N O F E A C H PA R T Z U F I N T O K E T E R A N D T H E A B Y A ע \" ואבי לכתר פרצוף כל התחלקות ענין בפרטי גם נמצא , יחד כולו בכלל הנבחן , וכל . לזה זה שוים ופרט שהכלל , לדעת יש ( קפ נבחן כלל בדרך שהמציאות כיון , ולפיכך . להפרט אפשר שאך , האחרון ובפרט , שבו פרטיות נבחנים ע \" אבי עולמות ' וד , העולמות של להכתר נבחן ק \" הא שעולם , ע \" ואבי ק \" א עולמות ' לה .( ג אות ) ן \" וזו ב \" לחו כל של הראש כי , האלו ' ה מכל כלול שאינו , ע \" אבי העולמות ' ד בכל קטן פרט לך אין כן כמו . שבו לאצילות נבחן החזה עד מפה והגוף . ק \" הא עולם כנגד שהוא , שבו להכתר נבחן פרצוף ליצירה נבחן רגליו סיום עד ולמטה ומטבור שבו לבריאה נבחן הטבור עד החזה וממקום . שלו ועשיה 180) In the spiritual worlds, everything is built according to the same principle, i.e., one can judge the common by the particular, and vice versa, the particular by the common. The entire Universe is usually divided into the five worlds of AK and ABYA. The world of AK is regarded as Keter of all the worlds, while the four worlds of ABYA are correspondingly Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut. Therefore, any world, Partzuf or Sefira – in general, any spiritual ob- ject, can also be divided into the five worlds of AK and ABYA. The Rosh of any Partzuf is considered its Keter and the world AK. The Guf, from the Peh to the Chazeh, is considered the world of Atzilut (Hochma). The space from the Chazeh to the Tabur is considered the world of Beria, from the Tabur, and below – the worlds Yetzira and Assiya (the ZON). . מ \" נהי ת \" חג ב \" כח ספירות לעשר מרובים כינויים שיש , שתדע וצריך ( קפא , ה \" ו ה \" י אותיות ' וד יוד של קוצו או , י \" נרנח או , ן \" זו ב \" כח או , פ \" ואח ע \" גו נקרא פעמים כי : ה \" שבהוי מילואים מיני ' ד שהם , ן \" וב ה \" מ ג \" ס ב \" וע פשוטה ה \" הוי או , הי ויו הי יוד הוא ב \" ע מילוי ( א , הי ואו הי יוד הוא ג \" ס מילוי ( ב , הא ואו הא יוד הוא ה \" מ מילוי ( ג . הה וו הה יוד הוא ן \" ב מילוי ( ד"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 472 , בינה היא ואמא , חכמה הוא ואבא , כתר הוא א \" שא . ן \" וזו א \" ואו א \" א הנקראים הם וכן . ע \" ואבי כתר או ע \" ואבי ק \" א נקראים וכן . מלכות היא א \" דז והנוקבא , י \" נה ת \" חג הוא א \" וז , טבור נקרא דבריאה והמלכות , חזה נקרא דאצילות והמלכות , פה נקרא דכתר והמלכות . רגלין סיום נקרא דכללות והמלכות , יסוד עטרת נקרא דיצירה והמלכות 181) Now, the Sefirot KaHaB HaGaT NHYM have many different names. Depending on what we wish to express, they may be called: 1) GE and AHP, 2) KaHaB ZON, 3) NaRaNHaY, 4) The dot of the letter “Yud” and the 4 letters “Yud”, “Hey”, “Vav” and “Hey”. 5) A simple HaVaYaH (Galgalta) and AB, SAG, MA and BON, which constitute four kinds of the light filling (Milluyim): a) Filling of the AB – הי ויו הי יוד b) Filling of the SAG – הי ואו הי יוד c) Filling of the MA – הא ואו הא יוד d) Filling of the BON – הה וו הה יוד 6) The AA, AVI, and ZON: a) The AA is Keter, b) The Abbais Hochma, c) The Ima is Bina, d) The ZA is HaGaT NHY, e) The Nukvah is Malchut. 7) AK and ABYA or Keter and ABYA. Malchut de Keter is called “the Peh”, Malchut de Atzilut – “the Chazeh”, Malchut de Beria – “the Tabur”, Malchut de Yetzira – “the Ateret Yesod”, and the common Malchut – “the Sium Raglin”. השואתו ענין הוא . א : הוראות ' ב ס \" הע של השמות שינוי באלו להבחין תמיד שיש ותדע ( קפב . אחריה שמתיחס הספירה מאותו שבו השינוי ענין הוא . ב , מתיחס הוא שמה שעל , להספירה ראש וכל . ה \" ב ס \" א ס \" ה י \" דאו ס \" דע הכתר , למשל . המיוחד בהכינוי שמו נשתנה זו שמסבה וכן . כתר נקרא עתיק פרצוף וכן . כתר כ \" ג נקראים ק \" א פ \" ה כל וכן . כתר כ \" ג נקרא פרצוף של . כתר נקרא א \" א"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 473 הם אם וכן ? הללו בהכינוים להקרא שמם נשתנה למה , כתר כולם הם אם : להתבונן יש כ \" וע ? להכתר להשתוות צריכים הרי , לכתר כולם מתיחסים שכל : הכלל זה כי . ס \" א בחינת שהם , לכתר שוים כולם הם אחת שמבחינה , הוא האמת אמנם . ס \" א בחינת הוא , בכלי נתלבש לא העליון שאור עוד תפיסא שום לנו אין כי . כלי בלי אור שהם התיקון עולם כלפי נחשבים ק \" א פ \" ה כל ולכן . ה \" ב ס \" א לבחינת אורותיו אצלנו נחשב ולכן .' א דצמצום בהכלים הם אחרת מבחינה אמנם . דנקודים הכתר מבחינת שניהם הם , דאצילות א \" וא עתיק וכן אחד שבכל , שלמים פ \" ה בו יש ק \" בא אבל , אחת ספירה הוא י \" דאו הכתר כי . מזה זה רחוקים ופרצוף , דנקודים העליון הכתר ממחצית רק הוא עתיק פרצוף וכן .( ב \" קמ אות ) ס \" רת מהם מיני בכל להבחין צריכים זה דרך ועל .( ט \" קכ אות ) דנקודים התחתון הכתר ממחצית הוא א \" א . ההוראות ' ב אותם הספירות של הכינוים 182) There are two reasons why the 10 Sefirot are called differently. The first is the similarity of properties to the Sefira to which it refers. The second is the difference of properties with this Sefira, which leads to the emergence of a new and special name. For example, Keter of the 10 Sefirot de Ohr Yashar, on the one hand, is the light of Ein Sof (of Infinity); on the other hand, the Rosh of any Partzuf is also called “Keter”. All five Partzufim de AK are also “Ketarim”; the Partzuf Atik is Keter and so is AA. If all of them are “Ketarim”, then why does each of them have its own name? Furthermore, we know that spiritual objects that have completely identical properties merge into a single whole. Then why do these spiritual objects (the Ketarim) not merge? It happens because, although they have properties similar to those of Keter (they refer to Ein Sof), there is a rule saying that unless the upper light enters the vessel (spreads to the Guf), it is regarded as Ein Sof (unattainable Infinity). Therefore, as regards the worlds of ABYA, all five Partzufim de AK are considered the light, which has not yet entered the vessel, since the AK, built according to the laws of TA, is utterly unattainable by the Partzufim de Atzilut, based on the laws of TB."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 474 The Partzufim Atik and AA de Atzilut both correspond to Keter de Nikudim. It should be noted that during Katnut de Atzilut, AA is not Keter, its level in this state being Hochma. Meanwhile, the only Keter is Atik. However, during Gadlut, all the Partzufim of Atzilut rise, Atik “leaves” for AK and AA takes advantage of its AHP de Aliyah and becomes the Partzuf Keter de Atzilut. Further, as with the entire Partzufim de AK, Atik is built in accordance with the laws of TA; hence, it is unattainable by the lower Partzufim and worlds (“Atik” derives from the word “Ne’etak” – “separated”). הוא , ע \" ואבי כתר בשם ס \" דע הכינוים שבאלו לעצמה המיוחדת שההוראה ותדע ( קפג שנעשו , דאחורים ולכלים דפנים לכלים ס \" הע התחלקות בחינת על היא שהכונה , להורות ת \" ת הנקרא , דגוף בינה למקום המסיימת מלכות עלתה שאז ,(' ס אות ) ' ב הצמצום בסבת שמתחת פרסא \" הנקרא , חדש סיום שם ונעשה , המדרגה את שם וסיימה , החזה במקום .( ח \" ס אות ) \" האצילות הסיום עד שמחזה ת \" ת ש \" שב . ע \" בי ונקראים מאצילות לבר יצאה ולמטה שמחזה והכלים זה שמטעם , נתבאר גם .\" עשיה \" נקראת והמלכות ,\" יצירה \" נקראים י \" ונה ,\" בריאה \" נקראים ומחזה ,\" דפנים כלים \" נקרא ולמעלה שמחזה , דאחורים וכלים דפנים לכלים מדרגה כל נחלקה .\" דאחורים כלים \" נקרא ולמטה 183) The ten Sefirot are called Keter and ABYA, because Kabbalists want to point to their division into Kelim de Panim (the “front” ves- sels) and Kelim de Achoraim (the “back” vessels), which took place during TB. As was stated above, Malchut Mesayemet rose from the level of Bina de Guf (called Tifferet) to the Chazeh, thus creating a new Sium de Partzuf called “the Parsa” and located below Atzilut. The vessels that are below the Parsa “left” Atzilut and are called BYA. The lower two thirds of Tifferet are called Beria, the NHY are called Yetzira, and Malchut is called Assiya. It is worth mentioning that each Sefira was divided into the vessels of “Panim” and “Acho-"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 475 raim”, so that those vessels above the Chazeh are Panim, while those beneath the Chazeh are Achoraim. , מיוחדות בחינות ' לד המדרגה מחלק , החזה במקום הפרסא של זה הבחן , ולפיכך ( קפד . עצמו ק \" בא הוא ההבחן וראשית . ולמטה מחזה ע \" והבי , החזה עד האצילות : ע \" אבי הנקראות .( ח \" ס אות ) שלו הטבור עד הפרסא ירדה בו אלא ולמטה ומטבורו . מטבורו למעלה המסתיימים ג \" ס ב \" הע הוא שלו אצילות בחינת ונמצא , ע \" אבי על נחלקים ק \" א פ \" ה איך הרי . שבו ן \" וב ה \" מ הפרצופים ' ב ששם , שלו ע \" בי הוא הוא טבורו עד ג \" ס ב \" והע , הראש הוא שהגלגלתא :\" פרסא \" שנקרא ,' ב דצמצום הסיום מכח . ע \" בי הוא ולמטה שמטבורו ן \" וב ה \" והמ , אצילות 184) Since the Parsa is on the level of the Chazeh, each Sefira and each Partzuf splits into four levels called ABYA. Atzilut is the space above the Chazeh, BYA – under the Chazeh. In fact, this division was also present in the world of AK, the difference being that in AK the Parsa descended to the Tabur, whereas in Atzilut, it is on the level of the Chazeh. It turns out that its own Atzilut is the Partzufim AB and SAG, which end above the Tabur, while its BYA, i.e., the Partzufim MA and BON, are under the Tabur. Therefore, Galgalta is Rosh; AB and SAG above the Tabur are Atzilut; MA and BON under the Tabur are BYA. דכללות הראש הוא א \" א כי : ע \" ואבי לכתר עצמם בפני האצילות עולם פ \" ה נחלקים ז \" ועד ( קפה , ושם . אצילות הם , החזה עד א \" דא ולמטה מפה המלבישים , ב \" ע שהם , עלאין א \" ואו , אצילות . האצילות עולם של האצילות בחינת המסיימת , הפרסא עומדת , החזה בנקודת ה \" מ שהם , ן \" והזו . דאצילות בריאה הם , טבורו עד א \" דא מחזה המלבישים , ג \" ס שהם , ת \" וישסו עולם שגם הרי . דאצילות ועשיה יצירה הם , האצילות סיום עד א \" דא מטבור המלבישים , ן \" וב הפרסא עומדת כאן אלא . ק \" א פ \" ה כמו , ע \" ואבי לראש מתחלק , שבו פ \" ה בכללות , האצילות .( ז \" קכ אות ) האמיתי מקומה ששם , א \" דא בחזה שהוא , מקומה על 185) All five Partzufim de Atzilut are divided similarly. AA is the Rosh of the entire world of Atzilut; AVI Ilayin, which correspond to AB and dress onto the Partzuf AA from its Peh to Chazeh, are Atzilut de Atzilut (not to be confused with the common Parsa of the worlds of ABYA)."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 476 The YESHSUT that correspond to SAG and dress onto AA from its Chazeh to the Tabur are the Beria de Atzilut. The ZON, which cor- respond to MA and BON and dress onto AA from its Tabur to the Sium de Atzilut, are Yetzira and Assiya de Atzilut. Thus, we see that the world of Atzilut is also divided into its own Rosh and ABYA. As in the world of AK, the Parsa is in its place, i.e., at the level of the Chazeh de AA. The principal Partzuf de Atzilut, Arich Anpin, has four kinds of dress: 1. Abba , 2. Ima , 3. Israel Saba , 4. Tvunah . All of them are the Yud-Hey of the name HaVaYaH and dress onto AA from the Peh to the Tabur . ZA and Malchut de Atzilut dress onto AA from the Tabur down to the Tabur do wn t o the Tabur Parsa ; they are the Vav-Hey of the name HaVaYaH . There are only Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma in the Rosh de Arich Anpin ; its Bina exited the Rosh and split into the Gar and the Gar and the Gar Zat . Abba ve Ima dress the light on the Gar de Bina and remain in the state of perfection felt in the Rosh , because they have properties of Bina , which desires nothing, hence stays unaffected. The YESHSUT takes the YESHSUT t ak es the YESHSUT Zat de Bina of Partzuf AA (located under the Chazeh de AA ), where the absence of Ohr Hochma is felt. This level is called “ Beria de Atzilut ”. לבחינת ק \" דא ג \" ס ב \" ע גלגלתא הפרצופים ' ג כל נבחנים , העולמות כל בכללות אמנם ( קפו , דכללות הפרסא עד ולמטה ק \" דא מטבור המלבישים , האצילות עולם פ \" וה . דכללות הראש , דכללות אצילות הוא שם הנה ,( ו \" ס אות ) ג \" דס דנקודות בחזה שנעשתה הפרסא שהיא .( ח \" ז-ס \" ס אות ) דכללות ע \" בי העולמות ' ג עומדים , ולמטה מפרסא 186) If we view the entire Universe as a single whole, we will see that the three Partzufim, Galgalta, AB and SAG of the world of Adam Kadmon, constitute its common Rosh; the five Partzufim de Atzilut, which dress onto the space from the Tabur de AK to the Parsa, are Atzilut of the Universe. The three worlds of BYA under the Parsa are the BYA of the Universe. לראש ע \" מאבי עולם שבכל פרטיות דפרטי מדרגה כל מתחלקת ל \" הנ דרך על וממש ( קפז , לחזה נחלק והגוף . וגוף ראש בו נבחן כי . שבעשיה דמלכות מלכות בחינת ואפילו . ע \" ואבי"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"“ T H E P R E A M B L E T O T H E W I S D O M O F K A B B A L A H ” 477 שלו בהחזה עומדת , המדרגה אותו של האצילות שמתחת , והפרסא . רגלין וסיום , וטבור הטבור שנקודת , המדרגה של בריאה בחינת הוא הטבור עד ומחזה . האצילות ומסיימת ומבחינת . המדרגה של ועשיה יצירה בחינת הוא רגליו סיום עד ולמטה ומטבור . מסיימתה . לבריאה הטבור עד שמחזה ת \" דת תתאין ש \" וב . לאצילות החזה עד ת \" החג נבחנים הספירות . לעשיה והמלכות . ליצירה י \" ונה 187) All individual Sefirot de Sefirot are divided in a similar way. Even Malchut de Malchut de Assiya has its own Rosh and Guf. The Guf is divided by its Chazeh, Tabur, and Sium Raglin. The Parsa, which is located under Atzilut of this level, stands in the Chazeh and limits it. Beria of this level takes the space between the Chazeh and the Ta- bur. Yetzira and Assiya of this level are located between the Tabur and Sium Raglin. The Sefirot HaGaT of each level correspond to Atzilut. The lower two thirds of Tifferet from Chazeh to the Tabur are Beria, NHY – Yetzira and Malchut – Assiya. והאצילות . גלגלתא לפרצוף או , יחידה או , כתר לבחינת מיוחס מדרגה דכל הראש ולכן ( קפח שמחזה , שבו והבריאה . ב \" ע לפרצוף או , החיה לאור או , לחכמה מיוחס , החזה עד שמפה , שבו שמטבור , שבו ועשיה והיצירה . ג \" ס לפרצוף או , הנשמה לאור או , לבינה מיוחס , הטבור עד ' ג מציור , בהאילן ותראה ) . ן \" וב ה \" מ לפרצוף או , נפש דרוח לאורות או , ן \" לזו מיוחס , ולמטה .( ל \" הנ הבחינות לפי מתחלק פרצוף כל איך , ואילך 188) Thus, the Rosh of each level refers to Keter or Yechida, or Partz- uf Galgalta. Atzilut (from the Peh to the Chazeh) refers to Hochma or the light of Haya, or AB. Beria (from the Chazeh to the Tabur) refers to Bina or the light of Neshama, or SAG. Yetzira and Assiya (below the Tabur) refer to ZON or the lights Ruach and Nefesh, or Partzufim MA and BON (see diagrams 3 to 12 in “Sefer haIlan”)."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"479 1.

All that was created before the birth of Adam’s soul (or simply soul) was prepared as an environment in which this soul can exist, develop and improve until it reaches its ultimate spiritual level. Let us speak about the top-down evolution of the worlds. Wish- ing to delight the created beings, the Creator intended to give them, perhaps, 100 kg of pleasure. Hence, He had to create such beings that would be willing to receive that pleasure. The entire essence of creation consists in this will to receive the Creator’s delight. Hence, the name “Yesh mi Ayn” , i.e., the essence created from something that was previ- ously non-existent, prior to the Creator’s Thought. This 'will to receive pleasure' was created for the single purpose of bestowing delight upon created beings. The creation of a will to receive for delight must go through four phases of development, since man cannot enjoy anything without having a passionate desire for that pleasure. Therefore, a vessel is a passionate RECAPITULATION BY RABBI BARUCH ASHLAG"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 486 desire for delight. The size of the vessel is measured according to volume of its desire. Two conditions are essential for a desire to appear: 1. You must know what you want to enjoy. Man cannot wish for something that he never saw or heard of. In other words, a pleasure has to be something previously felt and evaluated as such. 2. The vessel must not have this pleasure at this particular moment, since, if pleasure fills the desire, it extinguishes the aspiration to it. To achieve these two conditions, i.e., to develop a genuine desire, the initial will to receive pleasure (that derives from nothingness, from the Creator’s Thought) must pass four phases of its development: Phase Shoresh , 0, Keter is “the Creator’s “desire to bestow” delight Keter is “the Cr eat or’s “desir e t o bes t o w” delight Keter upon the createdbeings”. Phase Aleph , 1, Hochma is “the Creator’s “desire to bestow” de- light upon the createdbeings” created “Yesh mi Ayn”, out of nothing – a will to receive delight. Since the desire was created of the light – the pleasure prepared by the Creator, it emerged already filled with delight. Hence, there is no genuine striving after it. Phase Bet , 2, Bina . Since the light emanates from the Creator and His property to bestow, the vessel gradually acquires that property of giv- ing, i.e., the vessel wishes to be like the light. The emergence of a new desire in phase one turns it into a separate phase two. Question: “If the desire of Bina is to give, why is it considered coarser and more remote from the Creator? Does it not have to be purer than Hochma ?” I would like to explain it with the following example. A person gives his friend a gift and he accepts it. Then, after thinking it over, decides not to, and returns it. First, he was under the giver’s influence; hence, he took the gift. Yet, having received it, he felt himself a receiver, and this feeling of shame forced him to return the gift."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 487 From this, we may conclude that Behina Aleph received under the influence of the giver and did not feel that it was receiving. However, when, affected by the light, it felt it was receiving, and then it stopped. Therefore, the sensation of desire to receive pleasure in Bina is greater than that in Hochma – the desire feels more egoistic, because it compares itself with the light, i.e., with the giver. Hence, it considers itself more remote from the Creator. The light that enters the vessel, which wants to merge with the Cre- ator by its properties, is called Ohr Hassadim . This light shines in Bina . However, Bina feels only the “desire to give”, and it can only give to the light, to the Creator. Bina realizes that its goal is to receive, to enjoy. It can give the Creator only by receiving His pleasure. Hence, phase two makes a compromise: now it will accept the light of Hassadim and a little light of Hochma . Since Bina had to generate the desire to enjoy the Ohr Hochma in order to receive it, the new desire for both Hassadim and Hochma is coarser than the previous. That is why phase three is farther away from the Creator and is called Behina Gimel de Aviut . This phase bears the name “ Zeir Anpin ” – a small face, because Hochma is called “ Panim ” (“ Anpin ” in Aramaic), i.e., a miniature spiritual object. When phase three is completely filled with the light of Hassadim (and the luminescence of Hochma ), it feels the “desire to receive” the entire light of Hochma and not just its part. This happens because the light lets ZA know that the Thought of Creation consists in receiving the entire light of Hochma prepared by the Creator. This awakening leads to an enormous desire for the Ohr Hochma rising up in the vessel. It wants to receive as much light as was in Behina Aleph . The difference lies in the fact that Behina Aleph did not have this passionate desire for the light that Behina Dalet ( Malchut ) has, so Behina Aleph did not feel delighted, since the light gave birth to desire, whereas here the desire attracts pleasure! Therefore, phase four is defined as a genuine vessel, and all previ- ous phases are called preparatory. Malchut is filled with limitless, infinite"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 488 pleasure; hence, it is called the “World of Infinity” – 100 kg of delight filled 100 kg of desire. However, when the light fills phase four, Malchut , it starts passing it its properties, as it was in phase one: phase one received the light, but with the delight it acquired the light’s property of bestowal; hence, its “desire to receive” turned into a “desire to bestow”, phase two. Since this desire is absolutely opposite to its original, the natural will to receive pleasure, Malchut feels “shame” – a tremendous inner ten- sion between its original desire and the one it acquired. Because of this, it decides to completely stop receiving the light, similar to phase one as it passed into phase two. Why did phase one not feel shame? It is because phase four already has a desire to receive pleasure that derives from the creation itself, and not the one created by the Creator. The expulsion of pleasure from the desire (phase four, Malchut ) is carried out by the creation; hence, it is called “the First Restriction” (“ Tzimtzum Aleph ”). The light passed its properties to Malchut , so that it would become like the light; but Malchut only stopped receiving pleasure. So how can the creation carry out the Creator’s will – to receive the entire light of Hochma without being a receiver? After the restriction, Malchut makes a decision: to receive the en- tire delight according to the Creator’s wish, but only because He, and not Malchut itself, wants it. Question: “The Tzimtzum was made only on Behina Dalet ; only the desire “ Lekabel al menat Lekabel ” (“to receive pleasure for one’s own sake”, “reception for the sake of reception”) was restricted (in contrast to “receiving for the sake of bestowal”, which appears later). So why did the light disappear from all the previous Behinot ? Answer: The three first Behinot are not yet called “vessel”, for they merely contribute to the formation of the genuine vessel in Behina Dalet – “reception for the sake of reception”. The only true vessel is Malchut ;"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 489 if it does not want to receive, it stops feeling the light, as if being non- existent in phases zero through three. Malchut, having accepted the entire light, was filled with it. Such an absolute state is called whole or round, because a circle (or, rather, a sphere, since Malchut of the World of Infinity filled with the light is meant) is identical in all its parts; there are no “up – down”, “better – worse” in it. If every desire is filled, it does not matter what size it is, big or small; they all receive infinite delight. Only after the Tzimtzum , when the light disappears, the empty de- sires begin to differ in their properties, sizes, and closeness to the Creator. They divide into up and down according to their significance, become more or less spiritual, closer, or farther away from the Creator. The de- sires that are more distant from egoism are considered more important, those that are closer to it – less important. After the Tzimtzum, “traces” were left in the empty desires – the Reshimot of the light that was inside them. These five phases, or the 10 Sefirot (because phase three, ZA , consists of six parts) are called the “ten round Sefirot ” (“ Eser Sefirot de Igulim ”) after the restriction. They are called round because there is no notion of “up – down” in them. Since everything develops from the Creator to the creation, from perfection to imperfection, the upper object’s desire always becomes a law for the lower. Hence, after deciding not to receive the light for its own sake, Malchut makes a restriction, which applies to all future parts of the creation. Egoistic reception of pleasure would be impossible, and if some part of Malchut , e.g. man, has such desire, he will not be able to enjoy it, constantly chasing after pleasure. Malchut is the only creation. All that exists are its parts. Although the decision to restrict itself was voluntary, it became law the moment Malchut made it. Now reception for its own sake is forbidden. Malchut m a d e i t . N o w r e c e p t i o n f o r i t s o w n s a k e i s f o r b i d d e n .

Hence, reception for the Creator’s sake is called “a Kav ” (“line”), which spreads from the World of Infinity down to our world. After the restriction, the empty round, Sefirot fill with the light by way of the line. Thus, there are three states of the creation (desire, Malchut ): 1. The will to receive created in the world of Ein Sof , which received Ein Sof , whic h r eceiv ed Ein Sof the entire light. It is called Malchut de Ein Sof ( Ein Sof ( Ein Sof Malchut of the World of Infinity). 2. The restricted desire called “ Olam haTzimtzum ” – the World of Restriction, Malchut Metzumtzemet (restricted, empty Malchut ). 3. Malchut de Kav – Malchut , which decided to receive the light after the restriction, but only as much as it can accept for the Creator’s sake. After the restriction, Malchut decides to receive pleasure for the Creator’s sake. It attracts the entire light that it expelled previously and calculates what part it can receive; not for itself, but to please the Cre- ator. First, Malchut makes this decision in its mind ( be Koach ), then in action ( be Foahl ). Such an interaction of Malchut with the light, antagonizing its de- sire to receive pleasure for itself and accepting the light in its “desire to bestow” upon the Creator, is called “a Zivug de Haka’a Ohr be Masach ” (interaction between the light and the screen by stroke). Malchut puts a barrier before the coming light. This screen reflects the entire light, and then Malchut calculates that it can accept, perhaps, 20% of it for the Creator’s sake and receives it inside its desire, but this pleasure is dressed in the intention “for the Creator”. Malchut feels such enormous delight in the remaining 80% of the light that, if it accepts it, it will not be for the Creator, so it decides not to receive more than 20%. What is the difference between the Tzimtzum and the Masach ? The Tzimtzum took place because of Malchut’s independent decision to stop"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 491 enjoying the infinite light, i.e., the entire pleasure emanating from the Creator that is inside it. The Masach is a law imposed by the superior spiritual object as regards the lower: even if the lower wants to receive, the superior will not allow it. What is a Zivug de Haka’a ? Wishing to bestow upon the created beings, the superior spiritual object creates a “desire to receive” the light in the lower. The lower wants to be like the superior, so it decides not to accept the light. Hence, they contradict one another, which results in their impact ( Haka’a ). The superior and the lower objects are always the Creator and the creation, since each higher level, Sefira , Partzuf , world or soul represents Partzuf , w orld or soul r epr esents Partzuf a parent, a source from which the lower one originates and receives the light. Furthermore, the lower can attain only the level above it. So the superior is always perceived by the lower as the Creator. Because of this conflict, when each one wants to bestow and not to receive, an impact ( Haka’a ) takes place. Both come to an agreement by way of a Zivug (merging): the lower receives the light since the supe- Zivug (mer ging): the lo w er r eceiv es the light since the supe- Zivug rior wants it to, but only as much as it can accept with an intention to bestow. A Zivug is possible only if an impact ( Zivug is possible only if an im pact ( Zivug Haka’a ), a contradiction, preceded it. The whole process of a Zivug de Haka’a takes place in the part of the creation that precedes the action. Such comprehension and decision making ( be Koach ) is called the Rosh (head) or the Shoresh (root). Then the action ( be Foahl ) follows; it is called the Guf (body). Guf (body). Guf The Rosh , the preliminary estimate of the action, is necessary be- cause there are desires that are not equipped with an altruistic intention; hence, Malchut is obliged to make a calculation (called the Rosh ) before it actually receives the light in the Guf .

However, as soon as Malchut made its decision to receive only for the Creator’s sake, the need to oppose its own decision arose; the Sof was Sof w as Sof defined and the Rosh ( be Koach ) and the Guf ( Guf ( Guf be Foahl ) were separated. The 20% of the light Malchut received are called the Toch , i.e., the place where the light spreads inside the desire. A desire consists of the Rosh , the Toch, and the Sof . The Sof . T h e Sof Rosh ends in the Peh (mouth). The light is received in a space from the Peh to the Tabur . This part of a desire is called the Toch . Malchut de Toch , which received 20% of the light, stands in the Tabur . It also restricts the reception of 80% of the light in 80% of the empty desires. The light that is supposed to fill these desires of the Sof remains outside and is called “the Sof r e m a i n s o u t s i d e a n d i s c a l l e d “ t h e Sof Ohr Makif ” Ohr Makif ” Ohr Makif (“the Surrounding Light”). When the vessel is filled with 20% of the light from the Peh to the Tabur , the remaining 80% of the light (the Ohr Makif ) strikes into the Ohr Makif ) s trik es int o the Ohr Makif screen, positioned at the Tabur . This tells Malchut that it is wrong, since it cannot fulfill the purpose of creation in this way. If it remains on the same level, it will never be able to receive more than 20% of the light. Since Malchut can neither accept more than these 20%, nor remain filled only with 20% (seeing now that this state is far from perfect), it decides to stop receiving the light altogether. The collision of opinions of Malchut , which decided to receive only 20% of the light, and the Surrounding Light, is called the Bitush Ohr Makif be Ohr Pnimi or the Bitush Ohr Makif be Masach de Tabur . Each spreading of the light consists in filling all the five parts of Malchut . Even if Malchut is filled by 20%, it means that each of its five parts receives 20%. Therefore, when Malchut decides to expel the re- ceived light, it does so systematically. After the restriction, Malchut decides to receive 20% of the light, which it had in the state of being completely filled. That state left the Reshimot in Malchut , and it makes a Zivug on them.

As it rises, the Masach de Guf originat ed. As it rises, the Masach de Guf Masach uses smaller and smaller Aviut and consequently receives weaker light for the sake of bestowal. Being on the level of Behina Dalet , the Masach can receive the light of Yechida , on the level of Behina Gimel – Haya , on the level of Behina Bet – Neshama , on the level of Behina Aleph – Ruach . Behina Shoresh provides it with the light of Nefesh for the sake of bestowal, until it becomes com- pletely unable to receive the light for the sake of bestowal. A question arises: “What did the Ohr Makif gain by forcing the cre- Ohr Makif gain b y f or cing the cr e- Ohr Makif ation to fulfill the purpose of creation and receive more and more light? On the face of it, what happens is opposite to what the Ohr Makif wants: the Masach completely stops receiving the light and the vessel loses the little light it had”. Answer: There was no chance to receive any more light before the Bitush . Now that Behina Dalet disappeared, the vessel may receive more, i.e., in Behina Gimel . When Behina Gimel is lost, it receives light in Behina Bet and so on. New vessels were created with the help of the Bitush . So what is the gain, if each time the creation receives less and less? There is a rule: nothing ever disappears in the spiritual world. In other words, whatever was revealed remains; but it cannot be enjoyed. Only when the entire work is completed will all lights be revealed simultaneously. This will be the final gain. There is a story about two men who were friends when they were young. Then their ways parted. One became a king, the other a beg- gar. Many years passed, when one day the beggar found out that his friend had become a king. He decided to travel to the country where his friend was ruling and ask him for help. When they met, he told the king about his distress. The story touched the king’s heart and he gave the beggar a letter to his treasurer. The letter allowed the beggar to spend two hours inside the treasury and take as much money as he could within that time."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 494 Upon receiving the treasurer’s permission, the beggar began filling the cup he had used for collecting his alms with gold coins. When the cup was full, he moved to get out of the building, beaming with happi- ness. However, as he approached the door, a guard took the cup from his hands and emptied the contents onto the floor. The beggar burst out crying, but the guard told him: “Take your cup, go back, and refill it”. The beggar did as he was told, but as he came to the door, the guard once again emptied his cup. And so it went on until the two hours expired. As the beggar came to the door for the last time with the full cup in his hands, he began to implore the guard to let him have this last cupful, since his time was up. The guard told him that he could have not just the last cupful of money, but also all the coins that were scattered on the floor. From the story, we may conclude that every time we receive light for the Creator’s sake, it remains. However, if it does, there is no desire to accept more, since it is impossible to increase the intention for the Creator’s sake and receive a larger portion than before. Hence, the previ- ous level has to disappear, so that each consecutive level will allow the correcting of the vessels, until they are all completely corrected and all the lights simultaneously shine in them. Let us explain the notion of the Masach again. The first spread- ing of the light from the Peh down is called the Ta’amim . As the Masach gets weaker, new levels emerge in the process. All these levels are called Nekudot . My Rabbi said that new vessels were formed with the help of the Bitush . This allowed the reception of new portions of the light. As long as the light shines inside the vessel, it has no need or “desire to receive” the light. Therefore, both the light and the vessel are identical. However, after the expulsion of the light, they (the light and the vessel) can be separately defined. The levels that emerge during the weakening of the Masach are called Nekudot ( Nekudat Tzimtzum is meant). What is this? Malchut with- out the light is called a black point. When the ban on egoistic reception"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 495 is in force, darkness sets in. The point of the Tzimtzum starts acting in the place where the “desire to receive” for oneself arises. In our example, when the Masach loses Behina Dalet , the ban on egoistic reception applies to it and the point of the Tzimtzum snaps into action. Then this process spreads to Behina Gimel and so on. Now let us clear up the difference between the Rosh , the Toch, and the Sof . The Sof . The Sof Rosh is Behina be Koach ; there is no actual reception in it. Two parts spread from the Rosh : one can accept the light of Hochma , the Ohr Pnimi , the light of the Thought of Creation. Another part is a will to receive for one’s own sake, which may not be used by the vessel, so the Sof (end of reception) is formed there. It is called the 10 Sof (end of r ecep tion) is f ormed ther e. It is called the 1 0 Sof Sefirot de Sof . The Sefirot de Sof . The Sefirot de Sof main distinction between the Toch and the Sof consists in the fact that Sof consis ts in the f act that Sof the Toch is filled with the light of Hochma , while the Sof contains the light Sof cont ains the light Sof of Hassadim with luminescence of Hochma . The light of Hochma shines upon the vessels of reception and de- pends on their level of Aviut . The light of Hochma spreads top-down, so the notions “ Aroch ” (long) and “ Katzar ” (short) are inherent in it. The light of Hassadim neither spreads because of the Aviut nor de- pends on it; hence, the notions expressing width (“right” and “left”) are applied to it. This hints at the luminescence on the same level regardless of the amount of Aviut . We have so far discussed only the first Partzuf de AK called the Partzuf de AK called the Partzuf de AK Gal- galta or the Partzuf Pnimi de AK. Each world has a so-called Partzuf Pnimi , which is dressed in four “garments”. Let us make it clear in the case of AK. The Partzuf Galgalta consists of a complete HaVaYaH (the Creator’s Name – “ Yud - Hey - Vav - Hey ”). An independent level emerges from each letter of HaVaYaH . The Rosh is unattainable; it is called Keter or Keter or Keter Kotzo shel Yud ( point of Yud ). The part from the Peh to the Chazeh is called Yud . The second Partzuf de AK called AB emerges on this level and dresses onto it. The part from the Chazeh and below is called the first Hey . This is the third Partzuf de AK ."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 496 It is called SAG or Bina . Both AB and SAG are dressed above the Tabur and constitute the letters Yud-Hey . The letters Vav-Hey of HaVaYaH are located below the Tabur . The Vav takes the upper third of Netzah-Hod-Yesod, called MA , from which the world of Nikudim later emerges. The last Hey takes the lower two thirds of Netzah-Hod-Yesod . The Partzuf BON or Partzuf BON or Partzuf BON Malchut emerges from it. Later on, the world of Atzilut, using Aviut Shoresh, comes into being there. When the light disappeared from Galgalta , Reshimot remained in the empty vessels. Reshimo is a passionate desire for something that was available in the past. Reshimo consists of two parts: pure transparent light and coarser light. The Reshimo of the transparent light is left by the Ohr Yashar (Direct Light), whereas the Yashar (Dir ect Light), wher eas the Yashar Ohr Hozer (Reflected Light) leaves the Ohr Hozer (R ef lect ed Light) lea v es the Ohr Hozer Reshimo of the coarser light. Both of them merge and dress in the com- mon Ohr Hozer , which plays the role of a vessel. When the light shines upon the vessel, it is impossible to separate one from the other, both perform the same duty. It may be compared to food and appetite. Both take part in one process. If there is an appetite without food, eating becomes impossible. The same is true when there is food without an appetite. As soon as the light disappears from the Partzuf , the notion “vessel” Partzuf , the no tion “v essel” Partzuf arises. Ohr Hozer plays that role. This notion also refers to the Ohr Hozer pla y s that r ole. This no tion also r ef er s t o the Ohr Hozer Reshimot . When both the transparent and the coarse lights are combined together, they are called “light”. When Ohr Yashar disappears from the Yashar disappear s fr om the Yashar Reshimo , the coarse light receives the name Nitzutzin . The light that vanished shines from afar. Now we are going to discover the meanings of Shoresh of the vessels and Shoresh of the lights. There is a rule that states: all worlds emerge as ”a seal and its imprint”. The worlds develop in a descending order that corresponds unerringly to all the peculiarities that initially emerged. The vessels first manifested in the Partzuf Galgalta ; hence, it is called the Shoresh of the vessels. As long as the light shines inside the vessels, Shoresh o f t h e v e s s e l s .

The Reshimo of Ta’amim of T a’amim of is called Tagin . The Reshimo of Nekudot is called Otiot (letters). When the light exits the Partzuf Galgalta , two kinds of Reshimot remain. The Reshimo of the light Keter , which was inside the vessels, is called Dalet de Hitlabshut . The last degree of the Masach's power ( Dalet ) is lost and now only Behina Gimel de Aviut is left. The Hitlabshut is the Reshimo of Ta’amim ; the Aviut is the Reshimo of Nekudot . As the Masach in the Partzuf Galgalta grows weak and rises to the Masach de Rosh, two Zivugim took place in the Rosh of that level: one on Dalet de Hitlabshut , the other – on Gimel de Aviut de Ohr Hochma . Thus the Partzuf AB was born. The Dalet de Hitlabshut shines only in the Rosh of the level, preventing the light from spreading into the Guf . The Guf . The Guf Gimel de Aviut causes the light to spread in the Guf de Partzuf , i.e., in the vessels Guf de Partzuf , i.e., in the v essels Guf de Partzuf and the Otiot . As the Masach de Partzuf AB loses the last degree of Aviut Gimel , only Aviut Bet and Hitlabshut Gimel remain. After two Zivugim on these Behinot, the Partzuf SAG emerges. The Nekudot de SAG is Behina Has- sadim ; therefore, they can spread under the Tabur de Galgalta . Regardless of the Aviut Dalet under the Tabur (the vessels of reception), the Tabur (the v essels of r ecep tion), the Tabur Nekudot de SAG still wish to bestow, and are not interested in receiving the light. Having no Masach on Behina Dalet and being aware of the “desire to receive” present there, the Nekudot de SAG wished the light for them- selves. However, the Tzimtzum is imposed on the “desire to receive”, so the light instantly disappears. How is it that Nekudot de SAG (the vessels of bestowal) suddenly wanted to receive the light for themselves? The Gar de Bina did not want to receive. Only the Zat de Bina was supposed"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"R E C A P I T U L A T I O N B Y R A B B I B A R U C H A S H L A G 498 to get the Ohr Hochma to pass it on to ZA . Hence, the restriction took place only in the Zat de Bina , i.e., in the AHP that exceeded the bounds AHP that e x ceeded the bounds AHP of the level. This is Tzimtzum Bet ( TB ). The Gar de Bina , i.e., the Galgalta ve Eynaim ( GE ) did not merge with Behina Dalet . Meanwhile this place is called Atzilut . When the Masach of the Partzuf SAG began rising to the Peh de Rosh , the following Zivugim took place in the Rosh : a Zivug on Reshimot de Ta’amim de SAG , which did not descend under the Tabur , and on which the Partzuf MA Elion , emerged. A Zivug on Reshimot de SAG, which made Tzimtzum and merged with Behina Dalet under the Behina Dalet u n d e r t h e Behina Dalet Tabur . The Partzuf MA, called the world of Nikudim, emerged on them. This Zivug was made on one half of Zivug w a s m a d e o n o n e h a l f o f Zivug Aleph de Aviut and Aleph de Aviut a n d Aleph de Aviut Bet de Hitlabshut with the information on Hitlabshut w i t h t h e i n f o r m a t i o n o n Hitlabshut TB . There are two Rashim in the world of Nikudim : one is Keter –Bet de Hitlabshut ; the other is Abba ve Ima – Aleph de Aviut . Since Bet de Hitlab- shut cannot draw the light for the lack of desire, it needs to work together with the Aviut . We have learned that “the VAK de Bina ” is Behina “ Hafetz Hesed ”; with its help, this level feels no need for the light of Hochma . This light is also called “the Tikkun Kavim ” (correction of lines). We know that in the world of Nikudim “the Tikkun Kavim ” shines only in the Rosh , because the Hitlabshut cannot spread the light into the Guf . There was just some luminescence in the Guf . Ther e w as jus t some luminescence in the Guf Guf , so the state of Guf , so the s t at e of Guf Katnut brought no satisfaction to the vessels. However, as the light of Gadlut came, even the vessels of bestowal break. Only after the vessels break does an independent desire called “the creation” come into being and begins looking for the way to its source. Hence, there is no action in the Universe, from the beginning to the very end, which would not bring the creation closer to its goal – eternal, perfect, and infinite filling with the Supreme Light."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"499 T H E T E N S E F I R O T 1. First of all, one should know the names of the ten Sefirot : KaHaB HaGaT NHYM ( Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod and Malchut ). These ten Sefirot constitute the ten concealments of the Supreme Light, which exist in order to let the created beings receive that Light. It is impossible to look at the Sun without the help of some darkened glass that weakens sunlight and makes it suitable for visual perception. With certain reserve, this may be compared to the reception of the light by the spiritual objects (created beings), for which the Creator’s Light is too powerful; hence, it can be received only through these ten concealments. It should be noted that the lower the concealment is lo- cated, the more it weakens the Creator’s Light. 2. These ten Sefirot correspond to the Creator’s ten Sacred Names, mentioned in the Torah ( Zohar , Vayikra §§ 156-177): The Name אהיה ( Ekeh ) corresponds to Sefira Keter . The Name יה ( Yah , pronounced as “ Koh ”) corresponds to Hochma The Name ה \" יהו ( HaVaYaH , with the vowels of “ Elohim ”) corre- sponds to Bina . The Name אל ( El ) corresponds to Hesed .

The Name צבאות ( Tzevaot ) corresponds to two Sefirot Netzah and Hod . The Name שדי ( Shaddai ) is Yesod . The Name אדני ( Adonai ( A donai ( ) is Malchut . 3. Ten Sefirot correspond to the five Behinot (phases). The fourth Behina Zeir Anpin ( ZA ) or Tifferet contains six Sefirot : Hesed , Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod . The reasons for it are explained in great detail in “The Book of Zohar” (See “ Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar ”, “ Marot HaSulam ”, p. 5). Thus, the 5 Behinot are called: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Tifferet (or ZA) and Malchut (See also “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”, §§ 1-7) .

Sefira Yesod unites all of them. The fact that Behina Tifferet includes six Sefirot does not at all mean it is higher and better than Keter , Hochma and Bina . On the contrary, since the Behina Tifferet does not have the light of the Gar , its five Sefirot KaHaB TuM received new names - HaGaT NH. received new names - HaGaT NH. received new names - Sefira Hesed corresponds to Keter , Gevura – to Hochma , Tifferet – to Bina , Netzah – to Tifferet and Hod – to Malchut . Sefira Yesod is added to them. It is not a new level; it is rather a mixture of all the previous Behinot . Tifferet is otherwise called VAK - “ VAK - “ VAK Vav Ktzavot ” (six edges), which means six Sefirot ."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 501 T H E L I G H T A N D T H E V E S S E L 5. We cannot speak about the light in the absence of the vessel. “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah” in §§ 3-4 explains what the spiritual vessel is. First, there was just one vessel – Malchut . When we say, there are five Behinot KaHaB TuM, we actually mean that they constitute parts of Malchut called Behina Dalet . In fact, these Behinot are stages of the vessel’s development, whereas Malchut is a final stage (See “The Pre- amble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”, § 5). After the First Restriction ( Tzimtzum Aleph, TA ) the Kli Malchut puts up a screen ( Masach ), which prevents the light from getting inside it. As the Supreme Light tries to enter Malchut , it impacts the screen, and is reflected by it. This process is called “a Zivug de Haka’a ” (a stroke interaction) between the light and the screen of Malchut . The light that bounces back is called “the ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light”. R O S H , T O C H , S O F , P E H , T A B U R , S I U M R A G L I N 6. Because of the emergence of new vessels of the Reflected Light, three parts are formed in each Partzuf : the Partzuf : the Partzuf Rosh , the Toch, and the Sof . As Sof . As Sof was already stated, the screen blocked the reception of the light inside Malchut , which led to the Stroke Interaction (a Zivug de Haka’a ) between the light and the screen. The ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light created by this Zivug “dressed” on the ten Zivug “dr essed” on the t en Zivug Sefirot of the Direct Light. The ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light combined with the ten Sefirot of the Direct Light form the ten Sefirot de Rosh . However, the ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light and the ten Sefirot of the Direct Light are not yet genuine vessels. The word “vessel” points to a certain “ Aviut ” – the size of a “desire to receive”. This means that the power of the category of Judgment, the ban inherent in the screen, prevents the light from entering Malchut . There is a rule: the power ofthe ban is effective only below the point of the restriction, but never above it. Since the ten Sefirot of the Reflected"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 502 Light rise above the screen, the restriction does not apply to it; therefore, it cannot be a genuine vessel. The ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light are called “the Rosh ”. These ten Sefirot are not considered the real vessels. Malchut with a screen that makes a Zivug de Haka’a is called “the Peh ” (mouth). Similar to a material mouth, which utters sounds designated by letters, the spiritual Peh forms the ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light called the five Behinot KaHaB TuM resulting from a Zivug de Haka’a. These Sefirot are the vessels for the Di- rect Light; these vessels are called “letters” (“ Otiot ”). Thus, now we know what the ten Sefirot de Rosh are. 7. When the ten Sefirot of the Direct Light, and the ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light spread under the screen, the ten Sefirot of the Reflected Light turn into the real vessels for the reception of the light. These in turn dress onto the ten Sefirot of the Direct Light. This happens because the screen that created the Reflected Light already rules over it with the help of its Aviut . These ten Sefirot (now genuine vessels) are called “the Toch ” and “the Guf ”, i.e., they constitute the inner part of the Guf ”, i.e., the y cons titut e the inner par t of the Guf Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf Malchut de Toch is called “ Tabur ”. The Tabur is a center. It means Tabur is a cent er . It means Tabur that Malchut de Toch is a central, principal Malchut . The genuine vessels of the Guf were formed out of its Reflected Light. We may also add that Guf w er e f ormed out of its R ef lect ed Light. W e ma y also add that Guf the word Tabur ( Tabur ( Tabur טבור ) consists of the same combination of letters as the word אור טוב (“ Tov - Ohr ”, good light). This suggests that the light is good when it is inside the vessels fit to receive it. Thus, now we understand the meaning of the ten Sefirot de Toch down to the Tabur . 8. There are two Behinot in Malchut de Rosh : 1. Malchut Mesayemet (limiting), i.e., the Masach in this place prevents the light from entering Masach i n t h i s p l a c e p r e v e n t s t h e l i g h t f r o m e n t e r i n g Masach the vessels of Malchut ; 2. Malchut Mizdaveget, which makes a Zivug . There would have been no vessels of reception, unless the light impacted on the screen (a Zivug de Haka’a ) and elevated the Reflected Light. There would have been no light, because without the vessel the light does not exist. These Behinot exist in Malchut de Rosh only as “ Shorashim ” – roots, sources. Malchut Mesayemet de Rosh is a root of the Malchut Mesayemet ,"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 503 which completes this level. Malchut Mizdaveget de Rosh causes the light to get inside the vessels. Both of these actions really happen only in the Guf of the Partzuf , i.e., in the space between the Partzuf , i.e., in the space be tw een the Partzuf Peh and the Tabur , where the Malchut Mizdaveget rules, and so the Supreme Light enters the vessels. Malchut Mesayemet rules in the space between the Tabur and the Tabur a n d t h e Tabur Sium , creating the ten Sefirot de Sium (end of the Partzuf ). Each of these Partzuf ) .

The Partzuf ends at the point of Partzuf e n d s a t t h e p o i n t o f Partzuf Malchut de Sium , since this is exactly the Malchut Mesayemet that does not receive any light; it limits the spreading of the Kli de Partzuf .

Partzuf These ten Sefirot de Sium , which spread from the Tabur down to the Tabur d o w n t o t h e Tabur Sium Raglin , are called the ten Sefirot de Sof ; they are all parts of Sefirot de Sof ; t h e y a r e a l l p a r t s o f Sefirot de Sof Malchut de Sof and de Sof a n d de Sof de Sium . By saying that there is only the Reflected Light inside these Sefirot, we do not mean they have no Direct Light at all. There is some luminescence of the Direct Light in them, but it is considered the VAK bli Rosh (See “The Preamble to the Wisdom of Kabbalah”, § 50-53). VAK bli Rosh ( S e e “ T h e P r e a m b l e t o t h e W i s d o m o f K a b b a l a h ” , § 5 0 - 5 3 ) . VAK bli Rosh C H A Z E H ( C H E S T ) 9.

Ho w ev er , a ne w AK Sium is added in the Partzufim de Atzilut , in the ten Sefirot de Toch . It happens because Malchut de Toch, called the Tabur, rose to Bina of the ten Sefirot de Toch, and restricted them. This new Sium (end) is called “ Chazeh ”. This is where the Parsa is. The Torah calls this boundary “the firmament” (“ Rakia ”); it sepa- rates “the upper waters” (i.e., Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma de Toch ) from “the lower waters” (the vessels of Bina , ZA and Malchut ), which descended from the level of the Toch to the Sof . Because of this, the ten Sof . Because of this, the t en Sof Sefirot de Toch split into two levels: a space from the Peh to the Chazeh , still considered the Toch , Atzilut and the Gar de Guf ; and a space below the Gar de Guf ; and a space belo w the Gar de Guf Chazeh and the Tabur , regarded as the ten Sefirot de Sof , Sefirot de Sof , Sefirot de Sof Beria and also the VAK bli Rosh like the ten Sefirot de Sof .

This hap- pens because the upper vessels are the first to grow in the Partzuf : Partzuf : Partzuf Keter emerges followed by Hochma , Bina , Tifferet ( ZA ) and Malchut . Hence, we call the vessels KaHaB TuM , i.e., top-down, according to the order of their emergence in the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf The lights, however, enter the Partzuf in the opposite order, start- Partzuf in the opposit e or der , s t ar t- Partzuf ing with the lowest: first, Nefesh , then Ruach , Neshama , Haya and Yechida . Thus, Nefesh (the smallest light), which corresponds to the Sefira Malchut is first to enter the Partzuf , whereas Partzuf , wher eas Partzuf Yechida (the most powerful light), which corresponds to the Sefira Keter , is last to enter the Partzuf . Hence, Partzuf . Hence, Partzuf we always call the lights NaRaNHaY , i.e., according to the sequence of their emergence inside the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf 11. It turns out that when there is only one upper vessel, Keter , which appears first, it is not filled by the light of Yechida that corresponds to it, but with the weakest light of Nefesh . When the second vessel Hoch- ma appears in the Partzuf , the second light of Partzuf , the second light of Partzuf Ruach enters it. By this, the light of Nefesh descends from Keter to Keter t o Keter Hochma, while Ruach fills Keter . After the emergence of the third vessel, Bina , the light of Nefesh descends from Hochma to Bina , Ruach passes from Keter to Keter t o Keter Hochma, and the light of Neshama enters Keter . As the fourth vessel ZA appears, the light of Nefesh descends from Bina to ZA , Ruach passes from Hochma to Bina , Neshama – from Keter to Keter t o Keter Hochma, and Haya enters Keter . With the emergence of the fifth, last vessel, all lights take their rightful places: Nefesh enters Malchut , Ruach – ZA , Neshama – Bina , Haya – Hochma and Yechida fills Keter . 12. It turns out that before all the five vessels of the KaHaB TuM emerge, the lights are not in their places.

Contrary to that, the lights Nefesh and Nefesh a n d Nefesh Ruach re- Ruach r e - Ruach mained on their level, and Neshama , Haya, and Yechida exited the Partzuf . Partzuf . Partzuf 14. Certain places in “The Book of Zohar ” say that since Malchut rose to Bina , only two letters י \" מ of the five letters that make up the Name Elokim ( אלהים ) remained on the same level, while three letters ה \" אל descended to the lower level (See The Introduction to the Zohar , p. 20). Other places inthe “ Zohar ” state the contrary, that because of this ascent, two letters ל \" א remained on their level, while three letters מ \" הי de- scended to the lower level (See “The Zohar ”, “ Bereshit (Genesis) 1”, § 59). The fact is that the five letters of the Name אלהים constitute the five Sefirot KaHaB TuM or the five lights NaRaNHaY . When Malchut rises to Bina, two upper vessels remain on this level – Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma, designated by letters ל \" א , and three letters, מ \" הי descended to the lower level. The opposite happens to the lights: the two last letters, י \" מ , corre- spond to the two lower lights – Nefesh and Ruach . They retain their level while the first three letters, ה \" אל , corresponding to the lights Yechida , Haya, and Neshama descended to the lower level. If one keeps that in mind and determines whether the lights or the vessels are meant in each particular case, many seeming contradictions will no longer be relevant. T H E R I S E O F M A L C H U T T O B I N A 15.One should pay close attention to the correction of Malchut in Bina . This notion is the root, the source of all Kabbalah , since Malchut represents the category of judgment (restriction). The world, the spiri- tual Universe, cannot be based only on restriction. Hence, the Creator elevated Malchut (judgment, restriction) to Sefirat Bina , which is the cat- egory of mercy."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 506 The sages say that the world was first created with the help of the category of judgment (restriction), i.e., Malchut , but seeing that such a world cannot exist, the Creator mixed the category of judgment ( Midat HaDin ) with the category of mercy ( Midat HaRachamim ), i.e., Malchut with Bina . Because of the rise to Bina , Malchut acquired its properties, i.e., the category of mercy. After that, Malchut starts ruling the world using its new properties. The process takes place on all levels, in all the Sefirot from the Rosh de Atzilut and down to the Sof de Malchut of the world of Assiya , because absolutely all levels, all worlds and the Partzufim consist of the ten Sefirot – KaHaB HaGaT NHYM . T H E D I V I S I O N O F E A C H L E V E L I N T O T W O H A LV E S 16. All Sefirot , all levels, are known to end with the Sefira Malchut . This means that Malchut of each level does not let the light enter it. The reason for this lies in TA (restriction), which forbids Malchut from receiv- ing the Supreme Light. Hence, the light spreads only down to Malchut without entering it; it stops, blocked by the screen. A Zivug de Haka’a (stroke interaction) is made on this screen. There- fore, as Malchut of each level rises to Bina , it begins to restrict the light in its new place in the middle of Bina . The lower part of Bina , ZA, and Malchut are now below Malchut Mesayemet . They happen to be outside this particular level and by this form its second half. Therefore, owing to the rise of Malchut to Bina , each level was di- vided into two levels. Keter , Hochma and the upper half of Bina remained on their level, while the lower half of Bina , ZA (which includes HaGaT NHY ), and NHY ), and NHY Malchut turned into the lower level. The new end created by Malchut in the middle of Bina is called “the Parsa ”. 17. As we know, there must be five lights on each level: Yechida , Haya , Neshama , Ruach and Nefesh , which are inside five vessels: Keter , Hochma , Bina , ZA and Malchut . After Malchut rose to Bina , only two"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 507 full vessels – Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma – remained in each level; Bina , ZA, and Malchut are absent there. Hence, only two lights – Nefesh and Nefesh a n d Nefesh Ruach – were left in each level. Ruach – w e r e l e f t i n e a c h l e v e l . Ruach They are inside the vessels Keter and Keter a n d Keter Hochma . Three lights – Neshama , Haya and Yechida are absent for the lack of appropriate vessels. In the language of Kabbalah, this process is described in the following way: letter י ( Yud ) enters the word “ אור ” (“ Ohr ”, “light”). As a result, the word “ אור ” turns into “ אויר ” (“ Avir ”, “air”). It means that the rise of Malchut to Malchut t o Malchut Bina causes the loss of the three first lights called “ Ohr ”, the light by each level. It retains only the lights Nefesh and Ruach, called “ Avir ”, air. Alter- natively, this process can be described with the help of five letters of the Name “ אלהים ”, which was divided in two parts – י \" מ ה \" אל , so that the two letters י \" מ correspond to the two lights Nefesh and Ruach in two ves- sels Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma that remained on their level. The remaining three letters ה \" אל correspond to the three vessels Bina , ZA, and Malchut , which descended to the lower level. D E S C E N T O F M A L C H U T F R O M B I N A T O I T S O W N P L A C E 18. Because of raising MAN (request, prayer) by the lower MAN (r eq ues t, pr a y er) b y the lo w er MAN Partzu- fim , the upper luminescence descends from the Partzufim AB and SAG ( Hochma and Bina ). This forces Malchut to leave Bina and return to its own place. Now letter י ' exits the word “ אויר ” (“ Avir ”, “air”), turning it into “ אור ” (“ Ohr ”, “light”). The vessels of Bina , ZA, and Malchut return to their level. Now each level again has the five vessels KaHaB TuM filled with the five lights NaRaNHaY . “ Avir ” turns to “ Ohr ”, because the three upper lights of the Gar, called “ Ohr ”, returned."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 508 T H E T I M E O F K A T N U T A N D T H E T I M E O F G A D L U T 19. Owing to the rise of Malchut to Bina , each level began to have two states, two periods: Katnut and Gadlut . After Malchut rose to Bina , the level ends under the Sefirat Hochma ; Bina , ZA, and Malchut descend to the lower level. Only the vessels Keter and Keter and Keter Hochma with the lights Ruach and Nefesh remain there. This state is called Katnut . When because of raising MAN by the MAN b y t h e MAN lower Partzufim , the luminescence of Hochma and Bina (light AB (light A B (light and SAG ) descends from the world of AK ; Malchut descends from Bina and returns to its position. The vessels of Bina , ZA, and Malchut rise to their level. Thus, five vessels, Keter , Hochma , Bina , ZA and Malchut and five corresponding lights, Nefesh , Ruach , Neshama , Haya, and Yechida again make up each level. Such a state is called Gadlut . Therefore, the state without the Gar , without the three upper lights, is called Katnut . The state wherein the three vessels Bina , ZA, and Malchut return and the lights of the Gar reappear is called Gar r eappear is called Gar Gadlut . T H E R I S E O F T H E L O W E R PA R T Z U F T O T H E U P P E R 20. The rise of Malchut to Malchut t o Malchut Bina creates an opportunity for each lower object to rise to the level of the upper.

During Gadlut , i.e., when Malchut returns to its place, Bina , ZA and Malchut rise to their level. By this, they elevate the lower level, inside which they were before, to their own. Consequently, the lower level receives all the lights that were in the upper level. Thus, we have discovered how the connection between the levels is formed due to the rise of Malchut to Bina , which allows even the lowest level to reach the highest."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y .

Now that we know what the rise of Malchut to Bina generally means in all phases of the worlds of ABYA , let us look at the details. For example, let us take to phases in the world of Atzilut called the YE- SHSUT and the SHSUT a n d t h e SHSUT ZON . Because of the rise of Malchut de YESHSUT to YESHSUT t o YESHSUT Bina de YESHSUT during Bina de YESHSUT d u r i n g Bina de YESHSUT Katnut , three Sefirot – Bina , ZA, and Malchut descended to the ZON . While being in the ZON, these three Sefirot acquired their properties. During Gadlut , when Malchut descended to its place, Bina , ZA, and Malchut returned to theirs – in the YESHSUT . At the same time, they elevated the ZON (or, rather, ZON ( o r , r a t h e r , ZON Keter and Hochma de ZON ), with which they actually constitute a single whole. As a result, the ZON also ZON a l s o ZON became the YESHSUT , i.e., acquired their properties and received the corresponding lights. U N L E S S M A L C H U T R I S E S T O B I N A , T H E Z O N C A N N O T R E C E I V E G A D L U T 22. It should be stressed that the ZON cannot receive the light of ZON canno t r eceiv e the light of ZON Gadlut by themselves, since they refer to the space under the Tabur de AK . Malchut rules there, controlled by the power of Tzimtzum (Restric- tion), which prevents it from receiving the light. However, during Gadlut , when Bina , ZA, and Malchut de YESHSUT elevated the de YESHSUT elevat ed the de YESHSUT ZON with them, ZON with them, ZON the ZON , in fact, turn into the YESHSUT ; now they (like the YESHSUT ) YESHSUT ) YESHSUT can receive the light of Gadlut . 23. Now we can understand what our sages meant by saying, “First, the Creator created the world in the category of judgment”. The ZON de Atzilut is called “world”. This word refers to our world, which receives the light from ZON de Atzilut . Whatever was received in ZON de Atzilut can be received by people in our world."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"T H E P R E F A C E T O T H E C O M M E N T A R Y O F “ T H E S U L A M ” B Y R A B B I Y . A S H L A G 510 Conversely, whatever was absent in ZON de Atzilut , cannot descend to our world. As we said, the root ( Shoresh ), the source of ZON de Atzilut, is the space under the Tabur de AK , where Malchut rules in the state of restriction. Therefore, the ZON cannot receive the light and exist. All the ZON canno t r eceiv e the light and e xis t. All the ZON more our world, located much lower and receiving from ZON de Atzilut, would be unable to exist. That is exactly what the following words refer to: “Then the Creator saw that such world cannot exist, so He mixed mercy with judgment”. It means that the Creator elevated the Malchut (judgment) of each level to Bina (mercy). In particular, the Malchut de YESHSUT rose to de YESHSUT r ose t o de YESHSUT Bina de YESHSUT ; as a result, Bina , ZA and the Malchut de YESHSUT descended YESHSUT descended YESHSUT one level, i.e., to the ZON . By this, they acquire that level’s properties. In fact, the Sefirot and the ZON become a single whole after their descent. ZON become a single whole af t er their descent. ZON Hence, during the Gadlut de YESHSUT , when Malchut descends to its own place from Bina , the three vessels – Bina , ZA, and Malchut also re- turn to their position on the level of the YESHSUT . With that, they also elevate the ZON , with which they form a single whole. As a result, the ZON rise to the level of the ZON rise t o the lev el of the ZON YESHSUT . This means they can now receive the same lights that the YESHSUT gets. At the same time, they pass the YESHSUT ge ts. A t the same time, the y pass the YESHSUT light to our world allowing it to exist. However, unless the categories of judgment and mercy were mixed, i.e., unless Malchut de YESHSUT rose to Malchut de YESHSUT r ose t o Malchut de YESHSUT Bina de YESHSUT , forcing Bina , ZA and Malchut to descend one level to the ZON , the ZON would never ZON w ould nev er ZON be able to rise to the YESHSUT , or receive the Supreme Light for our world and allow its existence. Thus, we understand what the rise of Mal- chut to Bina means."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"511 ALBUM OF DRAWINGS How to associate diagrams and charts with the text: The annotation P. on the diagrams indicates the associated para- graph number as found in the body of the text of Baal Ha Sulam e.g. Figure 8.

This happened in such a way that the “desire to receive” turned into a space void of the light.

All fields of science deal with what is perceived through our natural five senses, yet the Wisdom of Kab- balah deals with acquiring knowledge that exceeds their limitations. In Root of All Science, Rav Michael Laitman presents the differences be- tween Kabbalistic scientific method and the current method used by scientists. The distinction is in the ability of Kabbalah to incorporate human awareness in a verifiable analysis of reality. The enormous significance of this additional focus, to both the scientific researcher and the seeker of spirituality, is that it provides the leap in dimensions enabling the observer to penetrate the causal level of all aspects of existence and all events that occur in this world.

Rav Laitman’s scientific method provides individuals of all faiths, religions and cultures the precise tools necessary for embarking on a highly efficient path of self-discovery and spiritual ascent. The focus is primarily on inner processes that individuals undergo at their own pace. Bnei Baruch welcomes people of all ages and lifestyles to engage in this rewarding process. In recent years, an awakening of a massive worldwide quest for the answers to life’s questions has been underway. Society has lost its ability to see reality for what it is and in its place easily formed viewpoints and opinions have appeared. Bnei Baruch reaches out to all those who seek awareness beyond the standard view. It offers practical guidance and a reliable method for understanding the world’s phenomena. The group’s unique method not only helps overcome the trials and tribulations of everyday life, but initi- ates a process in which individuals extend themselves beyond the stan- dard boundaries and limitations of today’s world. Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag left a study method for this genera- tion, which essentially ‘trains’ individuals to behave as if they have al- ready achieved the perfection of the Upper Worlds, here in our world. In the words of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, “This method is a practical way to apprehend the Upper World and the source of our existence while still living in this world. A Kabbalist is a researcher who studies his nature using this proven, time-tested and accurate method. Through this method, one attains perfection, and takes control over one’s life.
