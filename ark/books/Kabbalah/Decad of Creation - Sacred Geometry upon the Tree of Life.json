It is a conte mp lation of exac tly how the universe was fashioned vi a the decad of Sephiro th. Such cont em plation can tak e m any forms, and one of the mos t co mmon is to consider how God utili zed Nu mber (and thus Geom etr y) in the archit ecture of All. This essa y is an exa mple of a Maha seh Berashith cont em plation. I will focus upon the ten verses in Gene sis con taining the words \"God s aid...\", and elabor ate upon the m using Num ber and Geom etr y to illustr ate each aspec t of the Creation. This is not int ended to be authori tative or def init ive. In fac t, there are many dire ctions one mi ght tak e these sam e m editat ions, and I encourag e each student to do so. 1. Kether (Cr own ) \"And Elohi m said, 'Let ther e be Light.' and t her e was Light.\" -Gen. 1:3 . The first Sephirah is ent itled \"Kether\" (the Crown). It is the first and highest of the Sephiroth, closest to the real m of God. In fact, from our position here on Ear th, it is hardl y separate from God. It is the Highest Divine Light and the Source of All. At this part icular point in Genesis, nothing has ac tual ly been created yet. Ever ything still exists strict ly as potent ial within th e Mind of God- the rea lm of pure Idea. It predat es the dua l (mascul ine-fe minine) processes of creat ion- which would tak e the ideas in to the blueprint and then building stages. I tend to relat e Kether to the \"Cosm ic Egg\" of the Big Bang Theor y. The Cos mic Egg, too, contain ed the entire ph ysica l universe within it, yet was in a state of U nit y prior to its explosion. Thus, we can see how the numb er One e mbod ies this conc ept. It is a single digit- Unit y; yet it is fro m the nu mber One that all oth er nu mbers will arise. Sacred Geom etr y associa tes the numb er One, cal led th e Monad, with the geom etric point. The point has no"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"mathema tical dim ensions of leng th, width or depth, and ther efore does not \"exist\" in an y tang ible sen se. It is h ypo thet ica l, acc epted me rel y on the strength of logic, and fai th in tha t logi c. The line- l ength, the first di me nsion- can not exist without a point at either end. Ther efore, th e geo me tric point is a nothingness from which ever ything ma nifests. This descript ion also fits Kether as the pure poten tial that pre-exists an y actua l cre ation or ma nifest ation. The point itself is s ome thing of a m ath em atica l paradox- ho w can one join together two \"nothings\" and end up with one \"som eth ing\" ? This is the sa me paradox of Creation- how did Som ething m anif est out of absolu te Nothingness? This ex nihilo birth of the Tree of Life from the Divine Source is em bodied in Kether , the Crown (and root) of the Tree. 2. Choc kmah (W isdo m) \"And Elohi m said, 'Let ther e be a f irma me nt in the m idst of the Waters, and let it divide the Waters from the Waters.\" - Gen. 1:6 ____ The second Sephirah is ent itled \"Chock mah\" (W isdo m). The sphere of the Zodi ac is found here, because the bel t of fixed stars represents a grea t barrier that separa tes the Divine Real m fro m the m anifest universe. As s uch, this Sephirah represen ts division and dualit y- represented by the separa tion of the Waters of the Deep into upper and lowe r. As the Co smi c Egg represents Unit y, the universe that sprang fro m it represen ts Duali ty. Magick al th eor y has long describ ed the universe as essentia lly dua l in natur e. The mos t imme diate exam ple would be the \"A s Above, So Below\" tenet of Herm eticism . The Yin and Yang of Eastern m ysticis m, the Masonic Pil lars of Solo mon's Tem ple and the King and Queen of Alche my are further exam ples. In the Qabal ah, we find this dual ity represented by Aim a (Mother) and Abba (Father). All that exists- eith er ph ysical or m erely conc eptua l- m ust a lso have its equal and oppo site. Positive and negat ive- also called activ e and passive, or ma le and fe ma le- are the two bui lding blo cks of reali ty."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Nume rolog y refl ects th ese ideas.

Therefore Chockm ah also represents the ener gy used in the Creat ion. 3. Binah (Understandi ng) \"And Elohi m said, 'Let the Wate rs u nder the heaven be gather ed together unto one place, an d let the dr y land ap pear .' And it w as so.\" - Gen. 1:9 Binah is the Sphere of Saturn- the slowest of the Planets, which a lso ma rks the upper barrier of the Seven Heavens. Saturn is kno wn to astrologers as the force of Limitation. In the first chapter of Genesis, this is sho wn b y the restric tion of th e Waters into one area- the confining of th e waters of the Ab yss. At the sa me time, Binah is the Great M oth er (Aim a) im pregna ted b y the Father (Abba), and from whom the lower Spheres of the Tree will em ana te. At this point the Nu merolog y begins to take on so me depth. Three is born from two, ju st as M other and Father create Child. In this case, the Children are the lower seven Sephiro th of the Tree. Three is a nu mber of mu ch m yster y: Duali ty is, indeed, the essenti al Law of the Universe- but Dual ity natural ly produces Tripl icity. For ever y Thesis there is an Antithesis, and for each pair of these there is a S ynth esis. In the rea lm of geom etr y, Binah brings us to th e second di me nsion- the plane (leng th plus width). Incidenta lly, the m ost basic for m a plane can take is the Triangle- corresponding to Binah's natura l nu mber of Three.

Ches ed (Mer cy) \"And Elohi m said, 'Let the Earth bring fort h grass, the herb y ielding seed, and the fr uit tree yielding f ruit af ter his kind, w hose seed is in itself, u pon the earth.' And it w as so.\" - Gen. 1:1 1 Chesed is the Sphere of J upi ter , the Force of Merc y and Abundance- especial ly the abundance of vegeta tion- as s hown in the above Genesis verse. This Sphere brings forth the lif e tha t was germ ina ted in Binah. Chesed is the fourth Sphere, and here an i mpor tant num erologi cal turn is taken. Four is not si mp ly progression from thre e. Considering the law of Trip licity, we can view the nu mber four as a new beginning arising fro m the co mp letion of the previous thre e stages. A great exam ple of this can be found in th e four Philosophica l El emen ts. T he Sepher Y etzirah describ es onl y three Ele ments proper - those of Fire, Water, and Air . Ear th is som eth ing of a h ypothe tical fourth Ele ment, and is actua lly a com bin ation of the other Three. Thus i t is that Chesed is also a creat ive force, beginning anew the process ini tiated in Chockm ah, onl y upon a lower l evel. Four also indica tes the geom etr y of this sphere, which ma y be represented by the Square or the equal- armed Cro ss. This is a symbol of fixat ion and stabi lity, represent ing all four El em ents as the basic building blocks of real ity.

The y felt war to be a necessar y thing by which the Gods settled disputes between kingdo ms.. It is thus that Gevurah is upon the Holy Tree of Life, rather than rel egat ed to the dem oni c Qliphoth beneath the Tree. Gevurah' s nu mber is Five, which rel ates to the poin ts of the Pentagr am . This is a dire ct con tinuat ion of the Four Ele me nts concep t of Chesed. Now , however , the Fifth Elemen t of Spirit has been added to rule over and bind the others. It is the Spiri t that reigns- in the E lemen ts and forces the m into an order th at wil l allow ma nifest ation. If Chesed was the establish me nt of the quantu m real m, then perhaps Gevurah is the sub- ato mic real m- where we find the first el em ents of ma tter m easurab le to mo dern scien ce.

This view arises from the stud y of astrolog y, where the Sun and M oon are described as the rulers of a horo scope. Thus, the y are fi tting symbo ls of the \"Rule of Spirit over the E lemen ts\"- or the Pentagra m. 6. Tiphar eth (Beau ty or Majest y) \"And Elohi m said, ' Let the waters bring fort h abun dantly t he moving creatur e that hath li fe, and fo wl that m ay fly above the earth in the open firma me nt of heaven.'\" - Gen. 1:20 Tiphare th, the Sphere of the Sun, is a ver y spec ial sphere indeed. It is the lower manifesta tion of Kethe r, the center of LVX (Lat in for \"Ligh t\") in the universe, and the Heart of the Tree over -all. Though Kether is the source of ener gy to the Tree, it is Tiphar eth which me ters that ener gy to the other Spheres. Notic e, in th e diagra m at the beginn ing of this essa y, that Tiphar eth is connected by pathwa ys to all of the cen tral Sephiroth of the Tree. This sphere e mbod ies the concept of the Sun as the center of the Solar System and Source of L ight unto the world. Just as the M oon is a ref lect ion of the Sun, so too is the Sun a reflec tion of the Divine Light of K eth er. The Genesis verse for Tiphar eth speaks of the first lif e in th e world arising from the sea. Tiphare th is often described as the Son of the Father and Mother (Chock ma h and Binah). Therefore, Tiphareth properl y embodies the life that sprang from the Sea of Binah. The natur al proces ses and cycles nec essar y to life beco me apparen t here, as illustrat ed b y the Sun's rising and fal ling through the Da y and the Year .

The Golden Dawn uses this s ymb ol to represent the six Plane ts orbiting the Sun (i mp lied in the center of the figure)- once aga in indi cat ing the Cycles of the universe. Also keep in m ind that the Hexagra m is for med of two interlo cking tr iangles, which are co mmo n s ymb ols of the pri ma ry El em ents Fire and Wate r. In the Sepher Y etzriah , Fire and Water are the two pri ma ry El em ents of Creation- the Fire above and the Waters below . 4 This further indi cat es the int erac tion of the Ele ments th at produce ph ysical cycles- l ike the heat of the Sun evapora ting wate r, which then rains down in stor ms, et c. If we consider Gevurah the establ ishm ent of the sub-ato mi c rea lm, then Tiphare th must be the a tom ic real m- where co mp leted ato ms are first set into the ir c ycles of motion. 7. Netzach (V ictory ) \"And Elohi m Blessed the m, sa ying, ' Be fr uitf ul, and m ultiply , an d fill the waters in t he sea s, and let fo wl multiply in the earth. '\" - Gen. 1:22 Netzach is the Sphere of Venus- the seat of pas sion, inspiration, expression, cre ativ ity, and insight. It is the m anifesta tion of Gevurah after passing through the Maje sty of Tiphareth. Therefore it is th e sphere of the pas sions of both love and war; embod ying the ma ting ritua ls as well as the batt le and hunting ri tuals of the ani ma l kingdo m- includ ing the hum an ani mal.
