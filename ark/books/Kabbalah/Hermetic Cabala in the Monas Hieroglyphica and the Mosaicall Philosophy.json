[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Hermetic Cabala in the Monas Hieroglyphica and the Mosaicall Philosophy Michael T. Walton Â© The word Cabala appears frequently in sixteenth and seventeenth century Hermetic writings. Though Hermetic philosophers apparently attached significa nce to Cabala, the nature of the relationship to Hermeticism is largely an unexplored area. It is th e purpose of this paper to investigate two Hermetic treatises, one by John Dee and one by Robert Fludd, and the Hermetic Cabala found in them. The words Hermetic Cabala may seem unfamiliar as no n-Jewish Cabala in Europe is often titled Christian Cabala. The difference between Christian and Hermet ic Cabala is, in this writer's mind, one of purpose . Christian cabalists like Johannes Reuchlin and Will iam Postel used Cabala as a weapon to bolster Chris tian theology whereas Hermetic cabalists like John Dee a nd Robert Fludd approached Cabala as a tool to be applied in understanding nature. In both Christian and Hermetic Cabala two subdivisi ons existed which were derived from their Jewish parent. One was practical Cabala or Cabala masith, a type of magic, and the other was speculative Caba la or Cabala iunith . In the works to be discussed, neither Dee nor Flu dd concerned himself with feats of magic performed by means of practical Cabala. They used C abala, rather, to describe nature. It is to the met hods and cosmology of speculative Cabala that one must t urn to understand the cabalistic ideas found in the Monas Hieroglyphica (Antwerp, 1564) and the Mosaicall Philosophy (London, 1659). The following discussion of Cabala will limit itself, therefore, to the methodological and cosmological idea's of speculative Cabala. Within the narrow limits prescribed above, it is hop ed that the important question of why Cabala was adopted by Hermeticists will be answered in par t.1 The subjects of this study were chosen because they illustrate two different applications of Hermetic Cabala. John Dee was enamored of the mathematical ideas of Neo-platonism. In his Monas Hieroglyphica , he approached Cabala as a means of explaining the cosmos in terms of geometrical sy mbols. Robert Fludd, though influenced by mathematics, was a physician and practicing alchemi st. Cabala was applied by him in the Mosaicall Philosophy to validate a scientific view of the world primari ly based on an alchemical interpretation of the Bible.2 It will be seen that Cabala had with in it concepts which were adaptable to each approach. Robert Fludd's interpretation of the traditional Se phirothic Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I The Hebrew word Cabala means tradition. Jewish caba lists believed that Moses received its teachings fr om God. Unlike the law of Moses, Cabala was to be give n only to a select circle of adepts. Joshua and the seventy elders of Israel were said to be the origin al group. In truth Cabala can only be traced to abo ut the ninth century A.D. and the writing of the mystical treatise Sepher Yezirah or Book of Formation . Yezirah was incorrectly attributed to Akiva ben Joseph (fl . 130). Saadiah Gaon (d. 942), a leading Talmudic scholar, wrote a commentary on Yezirah as did the famous Neo-platonist Soloman ibn Gabiro l, the Avencebrol of the Fons Vitae . The attention given to Yezirah by these prominent scholars helped to establish it and its mystical views as important as pects of Judaism. Yezirah contains ideas which became basic to Cabala. Besides being a standard text for Jewish mystics, Yezirah influenced Christian cabalists. It was translated and published in Latin in 1552 by Wi lliam Postel, a Christian. Two more Latin and sever al Hebrew editions appeared between 1562 and 1642. Yezirah is a description of the formation of the universe. Numbers, letters and words, all aspects of the Hebrew Alphabet, were the instruments of the format ion. This alphabetic view of creation became an integral part of later cabalistic works like the Sepher Bahir and the Zohar . Yezirah was a source for the cabalistic belief in ten Divine emanations or Sephiroth . Each emanation in Yezirah was equated with a letter of the alphabet and represented a step in th e act of formation. Later cabalists described theSe phiroth as attributes of the supreme Deity giving them name s like wisdom and love. The first Sephirah was the Spirit, Ruach , of the living God, Elohim . 3 The source of this emanation was later called the En Soph or boundless. The Ruach Elohim was the origin of three lesser emanations, Air, Water and Fire , which were thought to correspond with the letters Aleph, Mem and Shin . Six final Sephiroth arose in turn to complete the heavenly realm. They were Light, Depth, East, West, North and South . The ten Sephiroth existed in a celestial world and were eternal like their boundless beginning. Yezirah explains, \"their end is in their beginning and likewise their beginning is in their end ....\" 4 In its most developed form, Jewish cabalism taught that three other worlds, identical except in their nearness to the En Soph , arose from the Sephirothic world: the Briatic world, the habitation of the angel Metatron , the archetypal man; the Yetziratic world, the home of the angelic host; and the Assiatic world, the realm of the spheres, of matter and the residen ce of the prince of darkness. Cabala declared that man, an inhabitant of the lowe st world, was the microcosmic image of the archetyp al man. The Zohar states, \"The Heavenly Adam who emanated from the h ighest primordial obscurity (the En Soph ) created the Earthly Adam .\" 5 Cabala's strong adherence to the macrocosmal-micro cosmal analogy is further developed in the Zohar . It compares the letters of God's name, the Tetrag rammaton (Yod Hay Waw Hay) to the major parts of the body; the Yod repres ents the head, the Hay the arms and shoulders, the Waw the breast, and the final Hay, the back and legs (f ig. 1). 6 This macrocosm-microcosm analogy and the idea of a dark world of matter, it will be seen, were es pecially appealing to Fludd."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Cabala validated the alphabetic view of creation by equating the alphabet with physical reality. The s even double letters of the Hebrew alphabet were shown to correspond to the seven days of the week, the seve n planets, the seven heavens and the seven gateways o f the body. The twelve simple Hebrew letters were found to be the source of the twelve zodiacal signs , the twelve months and the twelve members of man. Cabala was scientific in that the correspondence be tween the visible world and the letters used in its formation was believed to be not just symbolic but actual. Cabalists were convinced that the study of numbers, letters and words yielded the underlying r ealities of the heavens and of the earth. This atti tude was adopted by Christian and Hermetic cabalists. The resemblance between the macrocosm-microcosm ana logy of Cabala and ideas started by Plato in the Timaeus and the Phaedrus gives an indication of why Cabala was acceptable t o Hermetic philosophers. Hermeticists as adherents of Neo-platonism would na turally seek out and adopt compatible ideas. The Hermetic belief in the Neo-platonic macrocosm-micro cosm doctrine found an ally in Cabala. Robert Fludd 1574-1637 There are also similarities between cabalistic conc epts and the Pimander of the Hermetic corpus. The Pimander relates that the divine Nous created the world by an emanation or Demiurge brought forth by his word."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"But the divine Nous . . . existing as Life and Lig ht brought forth by a word another Nous, the Demiur ge, who as god over the fire and the breath fashioned s even Governors who encompass with their circles the sensible world . . .\" 7 The series of seven governors originating from a wo rd is much like the Sephirothic doctrine of Cabala. The idea of a decending order of creation from the cele stial to the sensible world is also paralleled in C abala. In the Pimander , as in Cabala, the divine emanation is said to be reflected in man. The macrocosmmicrocosm relationship is thus established. The connection between the divine Nous, light and t he creation found in the Pimander is of importance, for the role of light is also stressed in Cabala. The Zohar supposes a view of creation similar to that of Her mes when it says, \"The most mysterious struck its void, and caused this point (the first emanation) to shi ne.\" 8 Cabala further teaches that man's soul is the image of the macrocosm because it is composed of light. The phrase \"in our image\" refers to light, declares the Zohar . 9 In this writer's opinion, it is in the similarity b etween the doctrines of Cabala, Neo-platonism and t he Hermetic corpus that the reason for the rapid accep tance and wide diffusion of Cabala in the Renaissance and early modern period is to be found. Cabala was a tool with tremendous appeal for men like Dee and Fludd. Because Cabala claimed to o riginate with Moses, an assertion also made for Neo-platonism and hermeticism, and relied on the Ho ly Scriptures for its doctrines, it had the added recommendations of age and divinity. Up to this point Cabala has been examined from the standpoint of its cosmogony and cosmology. Of equal importance are the methods by which cabalistic trut hs were wrested from Holy Writ. The tradition which Cabala claimed to represent was one of teaching hol y men the techniques necessary for understanding th e true and recondite meaning of the scriptures. Both Jewish and Christian cabalists saw the true message of the scriptures as: \"Like a beautiful woman, concealed in the interior of her palace, who when her friend and beloved pass es by, opens for a moment a secret window and is seen by him alone, and then withdraws herself immediatel y and disappears for a long time, so the doctrine onl y shows herself to the chosen . . .\" 10 Three techniques were applied to discover the hidde n woman: Notaricon, Tsiruf and Gematria. Notaricon is the art of decomposing words found in the scripture s and using their letters as abbreviations for othe r words or ideas. The notariconic method would interpret th e letters of the phrase B'reshith , in the beginning, to mean \"in the beginning God saw that Israel would ac cept the Law.\" Tsiruf is the division and/or transposition of the parts or letters of a word into all possible permut ations so as to form other words. By applying Tsiruf, B'reshith is found to yield B're , he created, Shith , six. The phrase he created six was used by cabalists to supp ort the doctrine of the Sephiroth. Gematria is the technique of employing letters as n umbers. A gematriatic example is Genesis 38:2 where the words \"Lo three men stood by him\", are found to have the numerical value of 701. The sum of the names Michael, Gabriel and Raphael is also 701. The conclusion is that they must have been the three m en. Cabalistic methods of exegesis are not limited to J ewish theology. They can, in fact, be used to prove almost anything from the scriptures. Christian scho lars quickly recognized this fact and adapted Cabal a to Christian theology. Hermeticists did not remain ign orant of Cabala's malleability. They used it to pro ve their mystical-religious theories of nature. Before turning to Hermetic Cabala as developed by D ee and Fludd, it would be helpful to look at the Christian Cabala of Johannes Reuchlin, an early pop ularizer of Cabala who greatly influenced Fludd. Reuchlin is important because he recognized the har mony between Cabala and Neoplatonism, explained Notaricon, Tsiruf and Gematria, and transmitted the cabalistic cosmology in his widely circulated work s."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In his first cabalistic treatise De Verbo Mirofico (Basel, 1494), Reuchlin identified the Tetragramma ton as the true source of the Pythagorean tetrad. By compa ring the tetrad with God's name, Reuchlin demonstra ted Greek philosophy's dependence on Cabala. The first letter of the Tetragrammaton, Yod, has the appearan ce of a point so Reuchlin saw it, in the Pythagorean s ense, as the beginning and the end of all things. T he second letter, Hay, numerically equal to five, was the sum of the trinity's union with nature, the dua d. The numerical value of the third letter, Waw, is six. T he number six was the symbol of perfection to the Pythagoreans. The last letter, also a Hay, symboliz ed the human soul which was between heaven and eart h as the number five was in the decade. Reuchlin's be lief that Cabala was the source of Greek philosophy opened fruitful paths for its application to the ex planation of philosophical and theological doctrine s. John Dee 1527-1608 In addition to philosophical Cabala Reuchlin practi ced a Christian oriented cabalistic spiritual exege sis, an example of which was deriving the names Father, Spi rit and Son from the letters of the Hebrew verb he created. 11 Reuchlin is valuable in understanding both Dee and Fludd. Dee saw mathematical possibilities in Cabala as did Reuchlin. Fludd appears to have been directly influenced by the cabalistic cosmology imparted by Reuchlin's works. His writings often ci te Reuchlin's De Arte Cabalistica (Hagenau, 1516). Reuchlin also provides a standard of Christian Caba la against which the goals and usages of Hermetic Cabala can be measured. II In his \"Mathematical Preface\" to Euclid's Elements , John Dee cites Boethius that God created all from number. He reasons that if all was derived from num ber, we can by means of mathematics: \". . . behold in the Glasse of creation the Form of Forms, the exemplar Number of all things numerable both visible and invisible.\" 12 Dee's view that nature originated from and can be d iscovered through mathematics is representative of Renaissance Neoplatonism. His views are especial ly like those of Nicholas of Cusa whom he quotes in the \"Mathematical Preface.\" Cusa in Of Learned Ignorance propounded the view that mathematics is a means by which God can be understo od. 13 Both Dee and Cusa agreed that mathematics is a useful tool because it allows a co mparison of the finite with the infinite. Dee saw mathematics as an intermediary between the natural and the supernatural. Mathematical things were not as perfect as the ideal world but were als o not as gross as the natural world. 14 At its highest level, Dee believed, mathematics leads to a knowledge of t he formal or celestial world of Platonism. It was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Platonism's concentration on the ideal rather than on the practical that accounted for its lack of pop ularity, said Dee. 15 Dee translated Euclid's Elements as a preparation to lead people from practical mat hematics back to the true science of Plato, a science which discovered the na ture of the universe. 16 It was in an attempt to explain the celestial realm and its order through mathematics t hat Dee made use of Cabala in the Monas . He treated Cabala as an adjunct to mathematics. To him true Ca bala was mathematical rather than linguistic. In th e Monas , he interpreted his monad by means of Notaricon, T siruf and Gematria. Dee believed the hieroglyphic monad to be a geometr ical symbol in which the organization and reality o f the entire universe was represented and from which the whole of creation could be derived. The role of the monad is analogous to that of the Hebrew alphabet i n traditional Cabala. The monad, said Dee, \"imbued [the astronomical symbols] with immortal life\" and allowed their meaning to be expressed \"most eloquen tly in any tongue and to any nation.\" 17 The monad could express all because the external b odies of the celestial sphere were reduced to \"their mystical proportions\" in it. Dee did not consider the monad to be his original d iscovery. It was, rather, a symbol based on the alchemical sign for mercury sent to him by IEOVA, t he Tetragrammaton, to rebuild and restore astronomy . The monad was to be viewed as a new dispensation or restoration of a preexistent art of writing which had become extinct. These points are made clear in the Monas' \"Preface to the King.\" \"Mercury may rightly be styled by us the rebuilder and restorer of all astronomy [and] an astronomical messenger [who was sent to us] by our lEOVA so that we might either establish this sacred art of writi ng as the first founders of a new discipline, or by his c ounsel renew one that was entirely extinct . . .\" 18 It seems that Dee equated the monad or its componen t parts with the origin of alphabets. The monad was , therefore, the ultimate source of alphabetical Caba la. He pointed out that the letters of the Latins, Greeks and Hebrews, like the monad, were derived from poin ts, straight lines and the circumference of circles . 19 Divine power was viewed by Dee as the source of the Hebrew alphabet and the symbolism represented by its vowel signs and letters. 20 A corollary to the view that alphabets originated i n geometrical symbols was the idea that alphabetica l Cabala is inferior to mathematical Cabala. Cabala i s most productive when applied to deriving knowledg e from mathematical symbols. Dee stated that the inve stigation of the monad, like the investigation of t he Hebrew letters, through Notaricon, Tsiruf and Gemat ria, is a holy art. 21 Dee's purpose was not only to understand the myster ies of visible and invisible things by interpreting the monad with Cabala but also to demonstrate to th e Jews, in a missionary sense, that God is benevolent to all, i.e. he has endowed Christians w ith great wisdom. \". . . then (compelled by truth, if he may understa nd) he [the Jewish cabalist] will call this art hol y. too; and he will own that, without regard to person, the sam e most benevolent God is not only of the Jews but o f all peoples, nations and languages.\" 22 It was, then, not without some religious zeal that Dee discussed Cabala with the Jews. The Monas' Christian tone is especially obvious in the preface where Dee, like Reuchlin, states that Cabala is no t opposed to the Trinity. 23 He viewed non-Jewish Cabala much like Reuchlin and believed it to be the true Cabala, a point he hoped to make to the Jews. Dee w as even more precise than Reuchlin in his definitio n of true Cabala. He selected mathematical Cabala as the highest means of knowing truth. Still Dee consider ed the alphabetic form to be important. \"... no mortal may excuse himself for being ignoran t of this our holy language, [the cabalistic interp retation of the monad] . . . (which) I have called the real cabala, or of that . . . other and vulgar one, whic h rests on well known letters that can be written by man . . . \" 24 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Real or mathematical Cabala \"explains the most obtr use arts\" and was used in the Monas as a key to the universe. The Monas applies Cabala first as a geometrical form of Nota ricon. Dee describes each part of the monad as a symbol for a cosmic reality (fig. 2). Th is corresponds to alphabetic Notaricon wherein each letter represents a word or concept. Theorem One states that all things happen by means of a straight line and a circle. The monad embodies this basic reality for it is made up of lines and c ircles. Theorem Three says that as a circle is deri ved from a point and a line, Theorem Two, the circle and point of the monad represent the geocentric universe. Because the sun is the highest perfection of the un iverse, the circle and the point also represent it. The use of Notaricon is extended to explain the mon ad's joining of a half circle to the solar circle. The half circle represents the moon. The meaning is that on an evening and a day, the duration of the creative period in Genesis, the light of philosophers was made. Two final examples of notaraiconic interpretation are the rectilinear cross and the sign of Aries. The cross represents the mystery of the four elements from wh ich the world was made by the action of fire, symbolized by Aries. The technique of Tsiruf was used by Dee to derive t he signs of the planets from the component parts of the monad. As in alphabetical Cabala, Dee permuted the parts of the monad to form new and meaningful symbols. Theorem Twelve states that the signs of th e planets are derived from the symbols of the moon, the sun and Aries. The accompanying diagram shows that Saturn can be derived from the rectilinear cross wi th one half the symbol of Aries attached to the lower right quadrant. The construction of Jupiter is said to be opposite to that of Saturn (fig. 3). Theorem Thirteen deals with Venus and Mercury in a similar vein. Venus is made by attaching the solar circle to the cross and Mercury is the same as Venu s with the lunar half circle added (fig. 4). The ma jesty of the sun and its relationship to the moon and the zodiacal signs are demonstrated in Theorems Fourte en and Fifteen . The word Tsiruf appears in Theorem Twenty-three as a precise term to describe the permutations of the numbers which Dee associated with the monad. 25 It is clear, however, that the derivation of the p lanetary symbols from permutations of the monad is a correct general application of Tsiruf. John Dee used Gematria or numerical interpretation to a considerable extent in the Monas. Numbers are derived from the monad in Theorems Sixteen to Twent y. Theorems Twenty-three and the concluding Theorem Twenty-four, however, are the sections wher e the gematriatic method is most clear and intelligible. The discussion centers on the rectili near cross of the monad and its relationship to the Pythagorean quaternary. Using Tsiruf Dee determines that the numbers one, t wo, three and four have twenty-four possible permutations. By means of a gematriatic interpretat ion, Dee links, in Theorem twenty-four, the twenty- four permutations to the hours of the day; the six wings of the four Gospel beasts found in the Apocalypse of John; and the twenty-four elders mentioned in the s ame Apocalypse. This section is particularly worthy of reproduction as an example of Dee's application of the cabalistic method. \"Thus we shall now at last, in this our twenty-four th speculation, consummate and terminate the permutations of the quaternary, to the honour and g lory of Him who (as John . . . witnesses in the fou rth and last part of the fourth chapter of the Apocalyp se) sits on the throne and around Whom four animals (each having six wings) speak day and night; ... Wh om also twenty-four elders, . . . falling prostrate from twenty-four seats . . ., adore . . .\" 26 The Monas' mystical explanation of the universe gains intelli gibility when approached from the standpoint of Cabala. John Dee, as did the writers of Yezirah and the Zohar , explained the universe in symbols which had reality to him. The monad caba listically interpreted served its function well of embodying all the symbols related to the universe. The lack of Sephiroth and angelology in Dee's"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"system indicates how \"rational\" and \"mathematical\" he sought to make it. He used the cabalistic method but not the cabalistic cosmology. The primary goal of the Monas seems to have been the symbolic quantification of the universe. The religious aspects of the system should not be overl ooked for God was recognized as the source of truth and the origin of all things, the Form of Forms. Dee's role in developing a mathematical form of Cab ala which could be applied to nature seems to have been recognized by contemporaries for his monad app ears in Libavius' Commentariorum Alchymiae (Frankfurt, no date) and in Steeb's Coleum Sephiroticum Mainz, 1679). Reuchlin's theological Cabala which proved the superiority of Christianity is in marked contrast to Dee's geometrical Cabala which discovered celestial relationships. Just how mathem atical Dee's cabalistic system is can be best appre ciated when it is compared to Fludd's alchemical universe. III The Monas' description of the universe did not stress the mac rocosmal-microcosmal relationship or the material world. Dee's greatest interest seems t o have lain in knowing the celestial or formal world. Robert Fludd's emphasis in the Mosaicall Philosophy was quite different. As a physician and alchemist, Fludd was occupied with matter and man. He concerned himself with the celestial realm as it related to its material image. In the Mosaicall Philosophy he sought to elucidate and apply knowledge gained from the Bible of celestial influe nces to the material world and to the microcosm. It is through alchemy and cabala that the Mosaicall Philosophy attempts to explore the connection between the heavenly and the earthly worlds. Fludd did not believe that alchemy was the only sci ence that could describe the universe. Three mystic al sciences; Cabala, natural magic and alchemy, were c apable of illuminating the creation. The universe which these sciences were meant to explore consiste d of three worlds: the Intelligible, the Celestial and the Elementary. The Mosaicall Philosophy emphasizes the roles of alchemy and Cabala in desc ribing these worlds. 27 The book develops the relationship between the thr ee mystical sciences, the three worlds of the macrocosm and the three corresponding parts of man cabalistically. \"[Cabala, Natural Magic and Alchemy] . . . are the three mystical sciences, which are by wise men appropriated into the knowledge of the three worlds ; I mean, the Intelligible, the Celestial, and Elem entary, represented, according unto the Cabalists by these three Letters of the name of Adam. Also the three p arts of man, termed the little world, to wit, alteration and corruption, as also the elementary part.\" 28 Of importance in this passage are the cabalistic eq uation of the letters of the Hebrew word for man wi th the tripartate macrocosm and the emphasis placed on the alteration and corruption of the elementary world. The Mosaicall Philosophy and its use of Cabala may be viewed as an elucidat ion of these themes. Fludd begins his description of the universe with a cosmogony based on Genesis which resembles doctrin es found in the Pimander , in Cabala and in Paracelsus. The universe was cre ated by the \"Eternal spirit of wisdom\" or the Ruach Elohim , a term found in Yezirah, who \"doth operate by his Angelicall Organs of a Contrary fortitude, in the Catholic Element of the lower waters.\" 29 The contrary actions referred to are those of condensation and rarefaction. It should be noted that Paracelsus gives a similar view of crea tion by separation and coagulation in his Three Books of Philosophy Written to the Athenians. The angelical organs of the Ruach were the sun, governed by the 'potent angell' Mich ael, and its subservient forces the four winds, each also govern ed by an angel. The sun by \"celestial Alchimy, or spagerick vertue of the divine illumination\" divide d the waters into upper and lower parts. 30 The upper waters, the home of good angels, \"were obedient unt o bright Divinity, and were converted into a fiery nature\" whereas, the lower waters, Satan's habitat, \"being fecall, gross, impure, and therefore more rebellious unto light\" were converted into an eleme ntary nature subject to change. 31 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Fludd demonstrated the sun's role in the rarefactio n of creation by pointing to the action of a weathe r glass. In sunlight the water in the glass expands, but in darkness, the cold north influence of the elementar y world, the water contracts. Between the upper waters and t he lower waters existed the third part of the unive rse, the firmament. The firmament was the mediator betwe en the dwelling place of the Ruach Elohim and the fecal world. Above the firmament, all stood in the changeless si militude of God while in the world below the action of contraries led to change. As an example of the exis tence of opposite actions in the elementary world, Fludd cited the heart's systole and diastole, contraction by the cold nature of matter and dilatation by the act of formal light. 32 The trilevel universe which Fludd described is prim arily in interpretation of God's division the the w aters in Genesis. God's use of an intermediary Ruach Elohim suggests both the Pimander and Cabala. The Pimander's influence on Fludd is seen in his unpubished work A Philosophical Key (1618). The Key's discussion of the creation turns on a Demogorgon w hich worked by means of two intermediaries, chaos and eternity. The elementary world was descri bed as the Litigum, abortion, of chaos. It was the realm of evil and was fecal in nature. The Key like the Pimander also stressed the role of light in the creative process. The Mosaicall Philosophy continued the Key's fecal analogy and view of light but substituted th e Ruach Elohim and angelology of Cabala for the Demogorgon and it s agents. A most significant aspect of Fludd's cosmogony is i ts similarity to the alchemical process of distillation. The Divine emanation is viewed as an alchemist who used beams of light to separate the primordial waters into their constituent parts. The finest material rose, leaving behind the fecal debris of the elementary world. In distillation Flu dd believed that he had observed the process of creation described by Moses in Genesis. The weather glass was an experiment which supplied convincing proof of the role of light in rarefactio n. This explanation of creation based on experiment was the true mosaical philosophy.

It is difficult to determine how much of Fludd's ge neral scheme was taken from Cabala. Creation by lig ht's emanation, the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine and ang elology are all found in Neo-platonism and the Hermetic corpus as well as in Cabala. Fludd's extre me reliance on alchemical processes indicates that he probably used Cabala as a support for ideas develop ed from non-cabalistic sources. Cabala's similarity to his beliefs gave him a covenient proof for his view s. In the matter of particulars, Cabala, perhaps, a dded more to his thought. This is especially true of the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. Fludd displays good"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"cabalistic form when he states that the \"aevaill or angelical effect, is the image of the eternal Idea , and the temporal world, is the similitude of the aeviall.\" 33 It is true that in any macrocosmal-microcosmal syst em the two worlds are identical, but the interspers ion of a series of three worlds is reminiscent of the caba listic cosmos. The universe developed in the Mosaicall Philosophy is more like the three sub-Sephirothic worlds of C abala than the seven level cosmos of the Pimander . The Mosaicall Philosophy's use of light corresponds to Cabala. Fludd's statem ent that each \"world was made by the sending forth of God's brigh t Emanation\" 34 is paralleled in the Zohar . The three worlds of the Mosaicall Philosophy like the Zohar's differed only in that each had a \"lesse proportion of light than other.\" 35 Fludd's terminology and angelology in the Mosaicall Philosophy seem to be drawn from Cabala. As the cabalistic Sephiroth correspond to the divine attri butes so does each angel in Fludd's cosmos perform a necessary function to God's nature and his creation . The attribute Elohim, for example, sends down the power of cold effects to Saturn while the attribute Jehovah Sabaoth pours forth the beams of concupiscibility. 36 Even in this, his most cabalistic of moods, Fludd l eans heavily on ocular demonstration. The means by which angels influence the world, he compares to th e sympathetic action of a lodestone. 37 Angels do not work directly but rather through intermediaries in the firmament. Angelical beams proceed to the stars . Each animal or vegetable has a particular star \"tha t poureth out upon him his proper influence. 38 The topic of celestial influences on the elementary world as demonstrated by lodestones is the subject of the la st portion of the Mosaicall Philosophy . The doctrines of Cabala and alchemy are thoroughly mixed in the Mosaicall Philosophy . Fludd, perhaps, did not distinguish the two because their cosmological teachings were so similar. Both systems were, after all, sciences which should yiel d the same results in studying the universe. The scriptural interpretations of Cabala lent divine au thority to Fludd's alchemical views. His free combination and equation of Cabala with alchemy res ulted in a system which was a homogenous mixture of the two approaches. The Mosaicall Philosophy's discussion of the doctrine of anima mundi or world soul illustrates this homogeneity. The pagan concept of anima mundi, said Fludd, was the same as the Catholic soul of Christianity and the angel \"mitattron\" of Jewish Ca bala. 39 Anima mundi, Catholic soul and Metatron were simply three terms for the same truth. Seen in this syncretistic light the cabalistic elements in Flud d's philosophy make a good deal of sense. In reading the Mosaicall Philosophy , a question arises, how much first hand knowledge of Hebrew and Cabala did Fludd possess. This question grows out o f serious errors made by him in his cabalistic interpretations of Hebrew phrases. One near comical error which he committed was in referring to Zohar as a rabbi. 40 Another obvious misuse is found in part two of the Mosaicall Philosophy where Fludd tries to prove his three level cosmos by Notaricon. He asser ts that the phrase \"the heavens\", mem yod mem shin hay means the heavens or the firmament, are between fi re, the upper waters and the lower waters. According to Fludd, the spelling reads mem yod mem shin aleph = a shamaum . The Aleph and Shin, signify esch , fire and mayim , mem yod mem, represents water. 41 Fludd is correct, esch is fire and mayim water. Cabalistically they could mean that the hea vens are between fire and water. Unfortunately the interpretation is based on a mispelling, \"The heavens\" is spelled wi th a Hay , and not an Aleph. Such an error invalidates his conclusion and casts doubt on his knowledge of Hebrew. This writer has been able to find no usage in Jewis h Cabala where \"the heavens\" is interpreted using a n Aleph instead of a Hay. 42 If a check of the cabalistic sources cited in the Mosaicall Philosophy indicates"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"anything about Fludd's knowledge of Cabala, it was derived in large part from Johannes Reuchlin's De Arte Cabbalistica . 43 Reuchlin, in fact, is the only cabalist mentioned in the book. In light of Fludd's linguistic defects, it is stran ge that he, like Dee and Reuchlin, claimed his Caba la to be the true one. After discussing how the world was cr eated by twenty-two spiritual\", letters, he calls t he Jews to repentance by saying that Hebrew is \"much spoken by the learned Rabbis of our age, but little known or understood by them.\" 44 A similar indictment could be brought against Flud d. One should note that a critique of Dee's knowledge of Hebrew is more diffi cult to find than one of Fludd. Nowhere in the Monas does he betray his cabalistic sources. He actually used Hebrew but once and only then in an unintellig ible phrase. 45 In defense of Fludd, it would appear that his purpo se in the Mosaicall Philosophy was not to show a mastery of Hebrew or of Cabala but rather to integr ate a system dating from Moses into his alchemical view of the universe based on the Bible. If Moses received both Genesis and Cabala from God, should not Cabala be used to understand Genesi s. Fludd's major tool for discovering the mosaicall philosophy was alchemy and not Cabala, ho wever. The Mosaicall Philosophy's views were conditioned primarily by the physical theories of a lchemy and its ocular proofs. To these proofs were fit compatible doctrines of Cabala. In its own way the Mosaicall Philosophy was as successful a mystical scientific work as Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica . Its physical explanation of the universe took into account all the factors which Fludd considered necessary for scientific validation: Holy Writ, alchemical knowledge, and the cabalistic tradition. The systems which Dee and Fludd developed indicate two uses to which Cabala could be put by Hermetic scientists. The intensely mathematical approach of Dee found in Cabala a tool to explore cosmical relationahips. Fludd on the other hand saw the caba listic cosmology as a proof for his alchemical view of nature. Within Cabala's doctrines and methodology w ere the seeds for both interpretations. It was natural for Dee and Fludd to use a system of the supposed antiquity and divinity of Cabala. Cab ala's teachings, especially those concerning the creation and the macrocosm-microcosm, were welcome because of their harmony with the Neo-platonic and Hermetic doctrines upon which mystical science was based. The cabalistic approach was deemed scientific by bo th Dee and Fludd. They believed it, like mathematic s and alchemy, revealed the underlying processes and realities of nature. The difference between Hermetic and Christian cabal ists lies in the Hermetic attempts to integrate Cab ala into an explanation of nature. Reuchlin and his gen re sought to prove and illuminate Christian theolog y with Cabala, not to found a scientific world system . Both Dee and Fludd stepped into the theological a rena in declaring that theirs was the true Cabala and th at the Jews would do well to heed their teachings, but this proselytizing of the Jews was a secondary considera tion. Understanding two applications of Cabala to Hermetic science only begins to shed light on the b roader issue of Cabala's role in Hermetic thought. For the historian of science, a knowledge of Hermetic C abala can increase his understanding of the goals, the doctrines and the methods of Hermetic scientists.

In that book on page 164, he describes a tri-level cosmos based on Pythagorean and Platonic views. Muc h of the book is based on a mathematical description of the world. In his use of Cabala, however, Fludd did"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"not select out its mathematical aspects. He adopted , rather, Cabala's way of describing the physical o rder of the universe. The distinction between Dee as a math ematician and Fludd as a alchemist is, then, somewh at limited to their Cabala. 3. Cabalistic terms like Ruach Elohim were much used by Hermeticists.

The idea s Fludd set forth there are very much like Zoharic doctrines. He compared the Tetragrammaton to the p arts of the body and used"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the Zoharic names for the Sephiroth . The Yeziratic doctrine of a creation from earth (Aleph), fire (S hin) and water (Mem) was also developed.
