(Graetz,104-110) , in early centuries of the Christian Church, especially when ideas and views o f Gnostics were in vogue. He later revokes opinion. The written version has affinities with Babylonian, Egyptian and Hellenistic mysticism during the 2nd century BCE, when such a combination of influences was present. It became one of the most frequently and earliest published works of Jewish l ore. was the first systematic treatise of Jewish mysticism between the 3rd & 6th century.

Castelli, Firenze 1880. 11th Century 1040- 1105 Talmudic exegist Rashi of Troyes, France, discusses creation techniques of \"Sefer Yetzirah\" with the creation of man in the Talmud. He says: \"They used to combine the letters of the Name (Shem Ha-M) by which the universe was created. This is not to b e considered forbidden magic. For the words (works) of G_d were brought into being through His Holy Na me.\" In his treatise \"Erubim,\" he mentions the \"Sefer Yetzirah.\" 1060 R. Solomon ibn Gabirol was said to have created a w oman, a maid servant (\"Mimekor Yisrael, p. 752) . He was denounced bv other Jewish leaders for his he athenism. R. Byron L. Sherwin tells a similar story. 1092- 1167 \"I have heard it said that Ibn Ezra created a creat ure earlier than Rabenu Tam (R. Jacob Tam the Tosafist) and said: \"See what the Holy and Blessed One has g iven by means of the Holy Letters!\" And he said\" \"Turn back!\" And it became what it had bee n before (\"Mimekor Yisrael, p.752) . 12th Century In the beginning of the 12th century, as a reaction against the rationialsim of the previous era, Jewi sh masters began to elaborate on the golem. A work by Judah ben Barzilai, Judah ben, discussions of the golem of Barcelonia, or southern France or Cataloni a wrote a book on the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" citing many old versions. It also bore the the title \"Each man who looks at it (i.e., who contemplatively immerses himself in it, tzafah) , his wisdom is beyond measure,\"- that is, comparab le to the creative wisdom of G_d.\" At the beginning and end bears the title \"Hilkhoth Yetzirah\" and also \"Alphabet of Our Father Abraham.\" \"Othioth de-Abraham Avinu\". Discussion about the golem creation began appearing in commentaries on the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" during this period. In these commentaries, the word \"Golem \" also began to appear as a technical term for an artificially creatred being by applying the mysteri es of the \"Sefer Yetzirah.\" Medieval Jews and Christians believed that man has the power to creat e human life- \"matter without form.\" 11- 1200 German Hasidic Ashkenazi (Piestist) movement in German develops the golem legend. From them comes the word \"Golem.\" It was used to designate th e creature made by the invocation of names during mystical rites. It was essentially a symboli c spiritual experience. The Hasidics attained a successful creation as a culmination of their studi es of the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" and other texts. The gol em eventualy developed into an actual creatue as a ser vant to his master and dulfilling mineal tasks, suc h as housework. 1100 A golem was reportedly fashioned at the time of the Crusades in France by R. Samuel, the Kabalist, father of Judah Chassid, and author of the \"Book of the Pious\" (\"Sefer Chasidim\") . He claimed he could make a golem, but could not make it talk. It accompanied hm wherever he went as a servent and bodyguard. 1160- 1238 R. Eleazar of Worms wrote a commentary on the \"Sefe r Yetzirah\" called \"Pe'ullah ha-Yetzirah\" (\"practice or practical application of...\") along with R. Yehuda he-Hasid, both leading Ashken azi Hasidic leaders. Eleazar wrote down recipies for cr eating a golem. Dust is molded into the shape of a body and the letters are permutated (according to the \"Sefer Yetzirah.\" Late The Book \"Bahir\" (\"Sefer Bahir\") was written. It may be a reflection of earlier tra ditions (Scholem,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"12th c \"Origin of the Kabalah\" p. 49-198 Idel, \"Kabalah, N ew Perspectives\" p. 122-127 and i..J.

(MS Halberstam, 444 in Jewish Theological Seminary NY) . This, or a copy of it, is the source for J. Reuch lin's Latin translation in 1603. A 13th c. writer castigated those who said they cou ld duplicate the feat of Hanina and Oshaya by saying that \"they themselves are dumb calves.\" 3 statements written in the 13th century say the cr eation of an artifical man follows the same pattern as that of a calf, or a cow, with the latter being con sumed as food, The practical purpose of the practic e was not attenuated in the medieval period in Northe rn Europe. 13th c.

A t the end of the 12th c. there was a virtual explosion of discussions on the golem. The \"Pseudo- Sa'adyah\" text was printed in Jerusalem. The early Provencal and Catalan Kabbalists were not especially interested in the nature of the golem o r the way of his creation. Only Abulafia, among the S panish Kabbalists, was interested in this issue. He was the only Spaniard to produce a detailed recipe to create a \"creature.\" 1200- 1250 In Northern France, the circle of the Special Cheru bim engaged in lengthy discussions on creating golems. The difference between these French techniq ues and of Ashkenazi are: they both use combinations of Hebrew letters recite letters with moving in a circle around molded dust and the golem is destroyed by reciting the original combina tion backwards and circling in opposite direction (\"Golem!\" p. 12) 1210 The death of R.

An interest in the Golem among both Jewish and Christian authors began to develop during the Renaissance, especially in Italy where Jewish c ultures developed in the 15th and 16th centuries after the expulsion from Spain. Before the Expulsio n, Kabalists introduced the concept of the Golem as a way to demonstrate their superiority over Greek s cience and philosophy. (idel, \"Golem\" p 165) . In the late 15th century, recipes for creating gole ms were collected in N. Italy, translated into Lati n, and entered into the Christian Kabalah. By the end of the 15th century, Lodoico Lazzarelli, a Christia n Kabbalist, described the creation of a golem. After the 15th c. the legends began to become more widespread among non-Jews.

Azariel ben Menahem. one by R. Abraham. Another by Saadya Gaon in the 10 th c. Another attributed to Hay Gaon in early part of 11th c. Commenaties attributed to R. Moses Botrel, R. Moses ben Nahmann, R. Abraham ben David Ha Levi the younger, and R. Eliezer. Except f or the last, all were prior to Leon's work on the Zohar. It is said to have been used to show that th e novelty of that work (\"Sefer Yetzirah\") \"is of form rather than material.\" R. Saadya Gaon's commentary was published in Hebrew at Mantua with the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" (Bartolocci, \"Bibliotheca Rabinnica\" iv, 267) . It was originally written in Arabic. Copy preserv ed in the Bodleian Library. It remained in MS form for ov er 800 years when the Arabic original was reprinted at length in Paris with a French translat ion in 1892 by Lambert. 1583 (1537 ?) R. Eliahu Ba' al Shem of Chelm died. Ba'al Shem mea ns Master of the Divine Name. Best known legend of the time is connected with Elijah of Chel m. The tale developed in the 17th c. He was said to have created a golem from clay by means of the \"Sef er Yetzirah\" by inscribing the name of G_d on its forehead, which gave it life, but withheld the powe r of speech. When the creature grew like a giant, h e tore the life-giving name from its forehead and it crumbled into dust. The legends were transfered to R. Judah Loew ben Bezalel, not before the 18th c. R. L oew had no historical basis for this legend, tho. See 1630AD account. Two of R. Eliahu's descendants were great Hakalists : He-Hakham Zvi and his son Jacob Emden. They discussed the legal status of the golem: could the golem be counted in a minyan, the quorem of ten men required for prayer. Human form and modicum of understanding were not enough to make something human. Also, according to Emden, the dest ructive potential of the golem could destroy the world. 1587 Jo.
