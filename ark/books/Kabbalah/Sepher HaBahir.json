Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana said: One verse ( Job 37: 21 ) states, \"And now they do not see l ight, it is brilliant ( Bahir ) in the skies...[round about God in terrible majesty].\" Another verse, however, ( Psalm 18: 12 ), states, \"He ma de darkness His hiding place .\" It is also written ( Psalm 97:2 ), \"Cloud and gloo m surround Him.\" This is an apparent contradiction. A third verse comes and reconcil es the two. It is written ( Psalm 139 :12 ), \"Even darkness is not dark to You. Night shines like day -- light and darkness are the s am e.\" 2. Rabbi Berachiah said: It is written ( Genesis 1:2 ), \"The earth was Chaos ( Tohu ) and Desolation ( Bohu ). What is the meaning of the word \"was\" in this verse? This indicates that the Chaos existed previously [and already was ]. What is Chaos ( Tohu )? Something that confounds ( Taha ) people. What is Desolation (Bohu)? It is something that has substance. This is the reason that it is called Bohu , that is, Bo Hu -- \"it is in it.\" 3. Why does the Torah begin with the letter Bet ? In order that it begin with a blessing ( Berachah ). How do we know that the Torah is called a blessing? Beca use it is written ( Deuterono my 33:23 ), \"The filling is God's blessing possessing the S ea and the South.\" The Sea is nothing other than the Torah, as it is written ( Job 11: 9 ), \"It is wider than the sea.\" What is the meaning of the verse, \"The filling is God's blessing?\" This means that wherever we find the letter Bet it indicates a blessing. It is thus written ( Genesis 1:1 ), \"In the beginning ( BeReshit ) [God created the h eave n and the earth.\" BeReshit is Bet Reshit .] The word \"beginning\" ( Reshit ) is nothing other than Wisdom. It is thus written ( Psalm 111 :10 ), \"The beginning is wisdom, the fear of God.\" Wisdom is a blessing. It is thus written, \"And God blessed Solom on.\" It is furthermore written ( I Kings 5:26 ), \"And God gave Wisdom to Solomon.\" This resembles a king who marries his daughter to his son. He gives her to him at the wedding and says to him , \"Do with her as you desire.\" 4. How do we know that the word Berachah [usually translated as blessing] comes from the word Baruch [meaning blessed]? Perhaps it comes from the word Berech [meaning knee]. It is written ( Isaiah 44: 23 ), \"For to Me shall every knee bend.\" [ Berachah can therefore mean] the Place to which every knee bends. What example does this resemble? People want to see the king, but do not know where to find his house ( Bayit ). First they ask \"Where is the king's house?\" Only then can they ask \"Where is the king?\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Bahir 4 It is thus written, \"For to Me shall every knee bend\" -- even the highest -- \"every tongue shall swear.\" 5. Rabbi Rahumai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse ( Deuterono my 33: 23 ), \"The filling is God's blessing, possessing the Sea and the South\"? This means that wherever we find the letter Bet it is blessed. This is the Filling referred to in the verse, \"The filling is God's blessing.\" From there it nourishes those who need it. It was from this Filling that God sought advice. What example does this resemble? A king wanted to build his palace among great cliffs. He mined into the bedrock and uncovered a great spring of living water. The king then said, \"Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden. Then I will delight in it, and so will all the world.\" It is therefore written ( Proverbs 8:30 ), \"I was with Him as a craftsman, I was His delight for a day, a day, frolicking before him at every tim e.\" The Torah is saying, \"For two thousand years I was in the bosom of the Blessed Holy One as His delight.\" The verse therefore says, \"a day, a day.\" Each day of the Blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written ( Psalm 90: 4 ), \"A thousand years in Your eyes is as but yesterday when it is passed.\" From then on, it is at tim es, as the verse states, \"[frolicking before Him ] at every tim e.\" The rest is for the world. It is thus written ( Isaiah 48:9 ), \"I will [breathe out] My praise through My nose for you.\" What is the meaning of \"My praise\"? As it is written ( Psalm 145 :2 ), \"A praise of David, I will raise You high [my God, O King, and I will bless Your name for the world a nd forever].\" Why is this a praise? Beca use I will \"raise You high .\" And what is this elevation? Because \"I will bless Your name for the world and forever.\" 8. What is a blessing? It can b e explained with an example. A king planted trees in his garden. It may rain and water them, and the ground may b e wet and provide them with moisture, but still, he must water them fro m the spring. It is thus written ( Psalm 111: 10 ), \"The beginning is Wisdom, the fear of God, good intelligence to all who do them [His praise endures forever].\" You may think that it lacks something . It is therefore written, \"His praise endu res forever.\" 7. Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse ( Deuterono my 33: 23 ), \"The filling is God's blessing, possessing the Sea and the South?\" Moses was saying , \"If you follow my decr ees, you will inherit both this world and the next.\" The World to Come is likened to the sea, as it is written ( Job 11:9 ), \"It is wider than the sea.\" The present world is referred to as the South. It is thus written ( Joshua 15: 19 ), [Give me a blessing] for you have set me in the land of the south, [therefore give me springs of water].\" The Targum translates this, \"behold the earth is the south.\" 8. Why did God add the letter Heh to Abraham's name, rather than any other letter? This was so that all parts of man's body should be worthy of life in the World t o Come,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Bahir 5 which is likened to the sea. To the extent t hat we ca n express it, the Structure was completed in Abraham. [Regarding this Structure] it is written ( Genesis 9:6 ), \"For in the form of God, He made the man.\" The numerical value of Abraham is 248 , the number of parts in man's bod y. 9. What is the meaning of ( Deuteronomy 33: 23 ), \"[The filling is God's blessing, the Sea and the South] he shall inherit it ( YiRaSha H )?\" It would have b een suffici ent if the v erse said, \"inherit ( RaSh ) [the Sea and the South].\" But this comes to teac h us that God must also be included. The word YiRaSha H thus contains the le tters RaSh YH [meaning, \"inherit God\"]. What does this resemble? A king had two treasuries, and he hid one away. After many days he said to his son, \"Take w hat is in these two treasuries.\" The son replied, \"Perhaps you are not giving me all that you have hidden away.\" The king said, \"Take everything .\" It is thus written, \"the Sea and the South, he shall inherit i t.\" Inherit God ( YH RaSh ) -- everything will be given to you if you only keep My ways. 10. Rabbi Bun said: What is the meaning of the verse ( Proverbs 8:23 ), \"I was set up from eternity ( Me-Olam ), from a head, before the earth?\" What is the meaning of \"from eternit y ( Me-Olam )?\" This means that it must be concealed ( He-elam ) from the world. It is thus written ( Ecclesiastes 3:11 ), \"He has also place d the world ( Ha-Olam ) in their hearts [that they shou ld not find out the work that God h as done from the beginning to the end].\" Do not read Ha-Olam (the world), but He-elam (concealm ent). The Torah said, \"I was first, so that I mi ght be the head of the world.\" It is thus written, \"I was set up from eternity, from a hea d.\" You may think that the earth was before it. It is therefore written, \"before the earth.\" It is thus written ( Genesis 1:1 ), \"In the beginning created God the heaven and the earth.\" What is the meaning of \"created\"? He creat ed everything that was neede d for all things. And then God. Only after that is it written \"the heaven and the earth.\" 11. What is the meaning of the verse ( Ecclesiastes 7:14 ), \"Also one opposite the other was made by God.\" He creat ed Desolation ( Bohu ) and place d it in Peace , and He creat ed Chaos ( Tohu ) and place d it in Evil. Desolation is in Peace, as it is written ( Job 25:2 ), \"He makes peace in His high places.\" This teac hes us that Michael, the prince to God's right, is water and hail, while Gabriel, the prince to God's left, is fire. The two are reconciled by the Prince of Peace. This is the meaning of the verse, \"He makes peace in His high places.\" 12. How do we know that Chaos is in Evil? It is written ( Isaiah 45: 7 ), \"He makes peace and creates evil.\" How does this come out? Evil i s from Chaos, while Peace is from Deso lat ion. He thus created Chaos and place d it in Evil, [as it is written \"He makes peace and creat es evil.\" He creat ed Desolation a nd place d it in Peace, as it is written, \"He m akes peace in His high places.\"] 13. Rabbi Bun also sat and expounded:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Bahir 6 What is the meaning of the verse ( Isaiah 45: 7 ), \"He forms light and creates darkness?\" Light has substance. Therefore, the term \"formation\" is u sed with regard t o it. Darkness has no substance, and therefore, with regard to it, the term \"creation\" is used. It is simi larly written ( Amos 4:12 ), He forms mountains and creates the wind.\" Another explanation is this: Light was actually b rought into existence, as it is written ( Genesis 1:3 ), \"And God said, let there be light.\" Something cannot be brought into existence unless it is made. The term \"formation\" is therefore used. In the cas e of darkness, however, there w as no making , only separation a nd setting aside. It is for this reason that the term \"created\" ( Bara ) is used. It has the same sense as in the expression, \"That person b ecame well ( hi-Bria ).\" 14. Why is the letter Bet closed on all sides and open in the front? This teac hes us that it is the House ( Bayit ) of the world. God is the place of the world, and the world is not His place. Do not read Bet , but Bayit (house). It is thus written ( Proverbs 24: 3 ), \"With wisdom the hou se is built, with understanding it is established, [and with knowledge are its chambers filled].\" 15. What does the Bet resemble? It is like a man, formed b y God with wisdom. He is closed on all sides, but open in front. The Aleph , however, is open from behind. This teac hes us that the tail o f the Bet is open from behind. If not for this, man could not exist. Likewise, if not for the Bet on the tail of the Aleph , the world cou ld not exist. 16. Rabbi Rahumai said: Illuminat ion precee ded the world, since it is written ( Psalm 97: 2 ), \"Cloud and gloo m surround Him .\" It is thus written ( Genesis 1:3 ), \"And God said, 'let there b e light,' and there was light.\" They said to Him, \"Before the creation of Israel your son, will you then make him a crown?\" He replied yes. What does this resemble? A king yearned for a son. One day he found a beautiful, precious crown, and he said, \"This is fitting for my son's head.\" They said to him, \"Are you then certain that your son will be worthy of this crown?\" He replied, \"Be still. This is what arises in thought.\" It is thus written ( 2 Sam uel 14:14 ), He thinks thoughts [that none shou ld be cast away]."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Bahir 7 Section II The Aleph-Beth 17. Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: Why is the letter Aleph at the beginning? Beca use it was before everything , even the Torah . 18. Why does Bet follow it? Beca use it was first. Why does it have a tail? To p oint to the place from which it came. Some say, from there the world is sustained. 19. Why is Gim el third? It has three parts, teac hing us that it bestows (gomel) kindness. But did Rabbi Akiba not say that Gim el has three parts beca use it bestows, grows, and sustains. It is thus written (Genesis 21: 8), \"The lad grew and was b estowed.\" He said: He says the same as I do. He grew and bestowed kindness to his neighb ours and t o those entrusted t o him. 20. And why is there a tail at the bottom of the Gimel? He said: The Gimel has a head on top, and is like a pipe. Just like a pipe, the Gim el draws from above through its head, and disperses through its tail. This is the Gim el. 21. Rabbi Yochanan said: The angels were creat ed on the s econd day. It is therefore written (Psalm 104: 3), \"He r afters His upp er chambers with water [He m akes the clouds His chariot, He w alks on the wings of the wind].\" It is then written (Psalm 104 :4), \"He makes the winds His angels, His mi nisters from flaming fire.\" [Rabbi Haninah said: The angels were creat ed on the fifth day, as it is written (Genesis 1:20 ), \"And flying things shall fly upon the firmament of heaven.\" Regarding the angels it is written (Isaiah 6:2), \"With two wings did they fly.\"] Rabbi Levatas ben Tavrus said: All agree, even Rabbi Yochanan, that the water already existed [on the first day]. But it was on the second day that \"He raftered His upp er chambers with water.\" [At that tim e He also created] the one who \"makes the clouds his chariot,\" and the one who \"walks on the wings of the wind.\" But His messengers were not created until the fifth day. 22. All agree that none were created on the first day. It should therefore not be said that Michael drew out the h eave n at the south, and Gabriel drew it out at the north, while God arranged things in the mi ddle. It is thus written (Isaiah 44: 24 ), \"I am God, I make all, I stretch o ut the h eavens alone, the earth is spread out before M e.\" [Even though we r ead the v erse \"from Me\" (May- iti), it can also be read] Mi it i -- \"Who was with Me?\" I am the One who planted t his tree in order that all the world should delight in it. And in it, I spread All. I called it All beca use all depend up on it, all em anate from i t, and all need it. To it they look, for it they wait, and from i t, souls fly in joy."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Bahir 8 Alone was I when I made it. Let no angel rise above it and say, \"I was before you.\" I was also alone when I spread out My earth, in which I planted and rooted this tree. I made them rejo ice together, and I rejoiced in them. \"Who was with Me?\" To whom have I revealed t his mystery? 23. Rabbi Rahumai said: From your words we could conclude that the needs of this world were creat ed b efore the heave ns. He answered yes. What does this resemble? A king wanted to plant a tree in his garden. He searched the entire garden to find a spring flowing with water that would nourish the tree, but could not find any. He then said, \"I will dig for water, and will bring forth a spring to nourish the tree.\" He dug and opened a well, flowing with living water. He then planted the tree, and it stood, giving forth fruit. It was succe ssfully rooted, since it was always watered from the well. 24. Rabbi Yanai said: The earth was creat ed first, as it is written (Genesis 2:4), \"[On the day that God made} earth and heaven.\" They said to him: Is it not written (Genesis 1:1), \"[In the beginning God created] the heaven and the earth\"? He replied: What is this like? A king bought a beautiful object, but since it was not complete, he did not give it a name. He said, \"I will complete it, I will prepare its pedestal and attachment, and then I will give it a name.\" It is thus written (Psalm 102: 26 ), \"From eternity You founded the earth\" -- and then, \"the heavens are the work of Your hands.\" It is furthermore written (Psalm 104 :2), \"He covered Him self with light like a g arment, He spread out the heaven like a curtain, He rafters H is upp er chambers with water.\" It is then written (Psalm 104 :4), \"He makes the winds His angels , His mi nisters of flaming fire.\" Finally, it is written (Psalm 104 :5), \"He founded the earth o n its ped estals, that it not be removed for the world and forever.\" When He made its pedestal, He strengthened it. It is therefore written, \"that it not be moved.\" What is its name? \"And Forever (VoEd) is its name. And [the name of] its pedestal is \"World\" (Olam). It is therefore written, \"for the World And Forever.\" 25. Rabbi Berachiah said: What is the meaning of the verse (Genesis 1:3), And God said, 'Let there b e light,' and there was light\"? Why does the verse not say, \"And it was so\"? What is this like? A king had a beautiful object. He puts it away until he had a place for it, and then h e put it there. It is therefore written, \"Let there be light, and there was light.\" This indicates that it already existed. 26. Rabbi Amorai said: What is the meaning of the verse (Exodus 15: 3), \"God is a man (Ish) of war\"? Mar Rahumai said to him : Great master, do not ask about something that is so s im ple. Listen to me and I will advise you. He said to him : Wh at is this like? A king had a num ber of beautiful dwellings, and he gave each one a name. One w as better than the other. He s aid, \"I will give my son this dwelling whose name is Aleph. This one whose name is Yod is also good , as is this one whose name is Shin.\" What did he do then? He gathered all three together, and out of them he made a single"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Bahir 9 name and a single house. He said: How long will you continue to conceal your meaning? The other replied: My son, Aleph is the h ead. Yod is second to it. Shin includes all the world. Why does Shin include all the world? Beca use with it one writes an answer ( T'shuvah). 27. The students asked him : Wh at is the letter Daleth? He replied: What is this like? Ten kings were in a certain place. All of them were w ealthy, but one was not quite as wealthy as the others. Even though he is still very wealthy, he is poor (Dal) in relation to the others. 28. They said to him: What is the letter Heh? He grew angry and said: Did I not teac h you not to ask about a later thing and then about an earlier thing? They said: But Heh comes after [Daleth]. He replied: The order shou ld be Gimel Heh. Why is it Gim el Daleth? Because it must be Daleth Heh. And why is the order Gim el Daleth? He said to them: Gim el is in the place of Daleth, on its head it is in the place of Heh. Daleth with its tail is in place of the Heh. 29. What is the letter Vav? He said: There is an upp er Heh and a lower Heh. 30. They said to him: But what is Vav? He said: The world was sealed with six directions. They said: Is not Vav a single letter? He replied: It is written (Psalm 104: 2), \"He wraps Him self in light as a g arment, [he spreads out the heavens like a curtain].\" 31. Rabbi Amorai asked: Where is the Garden of Eden? He replied: It is on earth. 32. Rabbi Ishmael expounded to Rabbi Akiba: What is the meaning of the verse (Genesis 1:1), \"[In the b eginni ng God created] (et) the heaven and (et) the earth\"? [Why is the word et adde d in b oth places?] If the word et (an untranslated preposition that connects a transitive v erb to its predicat e noun) were absent, we would t hink that \"heaven\" and \"earth\" were gods. [For we could have read the verse, \"In the beginning, God, the heaven and the earth created... \" taking all three nouns as subjects of the s entence.] He replied: By the Divine Service! You may have reac hed out for the true meaning, but you have not sorted out, and therefore you speak in this manner. But [in the cas e of \"heaven\"] the word et comes to include the sun, moo n, stars and constellations, while [in the case of \"earth\"] it comes to add trees, plants, and the Garden of Eden. 33. They said t o him : It is written (Lamentations 2:1), \"He threw the beauty of Israel from heaven to earth.\" From here we see that it fell. He replied: If you have read, you did not review, and if you reviewed, you did not go o ver it a third tim e. What does it resemble? A king had a beautiful crown on his head and a beautiful cloak on his shoulders. When h e heard evil t idings, he cast the crown from his head a nd the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Bahir 10 cloak from his shou lders. 34. They asked h im : Why is the letter Cheth open? And why is its vowel point a small Patach? He said: Because all directions (Ruach-ot) are closed, except for the North, which is opened for good and for evil. They said: How can you say that it is for good? It is not written (Ezekiel 1:4 ), \"And behold, a stormy wind comi ng from the north, a great cloud and burning fire.\" Fire is nothing other than fierce anger, as it is written (Leviticus 10:2 ), \"And fire went out from before God, and it consumed them and killed them.\" He said: There is no difficulty. One case is speaking of when Israel does the will of God, while the other is speaking of when they do not do His will. When Israel does not do His will, then the fire comes close [to destroy and punish]. But when they do God's will, the n the Attribute of Mercy encompasses and surrounds it, as it is written (Micah 7:18 ) , \"He lifts up sin and passes over rebellion.\" 35. What is this like? A king wanted to pun ish a nd w hip his slaves. One of his governors stood up a nd asked the r eason for this pun ishment. When the king described the offence, the governor said, \"Your slaves never did such a thing. I will be their bondsman until you investigate it more thorough ly.\" In the meantim e, the king's anger was calmed. 36. His students a sked: Why is the letter Daleth thick on the side? He replied: Beca use of the Segol which is in the small Patach. It is thus written (Psalm 24:7), \"The openings (pitchey) of the World.\" There He place d a Patach above and a Segol below. It is for this reason that it is thick. 37. What is the Patach? It is an opening (Petach). What is meant by an opening? This is the direction of north, which is open to all the world. It is the gate from which goo d and evil emerge. And what is good? He mocked them and said: Did I not tell you that it is a small Patach (opening)? They said: We have forgotten, teac h us again. He reviewed it and said: What is this like? A king had a throne. Sometim es he carried it on his arm, and sometim es on his head. They asked why, and he replied: Beca use it is beautiful and it is a pity to sit on it. They asked: Where did he place it on his head? He replied: In the open Mem. It is thus written (Psalm 85: 12 ), \"Truth sprouts up from the earth, and the righteousness loo ks down from heaven.\" 38. Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Psalm 87: 2), \"God loves the g ates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\" \"The gates of Zion\" are the \"openings of the World.\" A gate is nothing o ther than an opening. We thus say, \"Open for us the g ates of mercy.\" God said: I love the \"gates of Zion\" when they are open. Why? Because they are on the side of evil. But when Israel does goo d before God and are worthy that good be opened for them, then God loves them -- \"more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\" [\"The dwellings of Jacob\"] are all peace, as it is written (Genesis 25: 27 ), \"Jacob was a simp le"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Bahir 11 man, dwelling in tents. 39. This is like two men, one who is inclined to do evil and does goo d, and the other who is inclined to do good and does evil. Who is more praiseworthy? The one who is inclined to do evil and does good, for he may do good again. It is therefore written (Psalm 87: 2), \"God loves the g ates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\" These [dwellings] are all peace , as it is written (Genesis 25: 27 ), \"Jacob was a sim ple man, dwelling in tents.\" 40. His students a sked: Wh at is Cholem? He replied: It is the sou l -- and its name is Cholem. If you listen to it, your body will be vigorous (Chalam) in the Ultim ate Future. But if you rebel against it, there will be sickness (Choleh) on your head, and diseases (Cholim) on its head. 41. They also said: Every dream (Chalo m) is in the Cholem. Every white precious stone is in the Cholem. It is thus written [with regard to the High Priest's breastplate] (Exodus 28: 19 ), \"[And in the third row... ] a white stone ( aChLaMah).\" 42. He said to them: Come and hear the fine points regarding the vowel points found in the Torah of Moses. He sat and expounded: Chirek hates evildoers and pun ishes them. Its side includes jealousy, hatred and competition. It is thus written (Psalm 37: 12 ), \"He gnashes (Chorek) his teeth at them.\" Do not read chorek (gnashes), but rochek (repels). Repel (rachek) these traits from yourself, and repel yourself from evil. Good will then certainly attach itself to you. 43. Chirek. Do not read ChiRiK but KeRaCh (Ice). Whatever the Chirek touches becomes ice. It is thus written (Exodu s 34:7 ), \"and cleanses.\" 44. What is the indication that Chirek has the conn otation of burning? This is because it is fire that burns all fire. It is thus written (1 Kings 18:38 ), \"And God's fire fell, and it consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and evaporated the water that was in the trench.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Bahir 12 Section III The Seven Voices and the Sephiroth 45. He (Rabbi Amorai) said: What is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 20:15 ) , “And all the peop le saw the voices.” These are the voice regarding which King David spoke. It is thus written (Psalm 29:3 ) , “The voice of God is upon the waters, the God of glory thunders.” [This is the first voice.] [The second voice is] (Psalm 29:4), “The voice of God comes in strength.” Regarding this it is written (Isaiah 10:13 ) , “By the strength of my h and have I done it.” It is likewise written (Isaiah 48:13 ) , “Also My Hand has founded the earth.” [The third voice is] (Psalm 29:4), “The voice of God is with majesty.” It is also written (Psalm 111 :3), “Splendour and majesty are His works, his righteousness stands forever.” [The fourth v oice is] (Psalm 29:5), “God’s voice breaks the ced ars.” This i s the bow that breaks the cypress and cedar trees. [The fifth v oice is] (Psalm 29:7), “God’s voice draws out flames of fire.” This is what makes peace between water and fire. It draws out the power of the fire and prevents it from evaporating the water. It also prevents [the water] from ext inguishing it. [The sixth v oice is] (Psalm 29:8) , “God’s voice shakes the desert.” It is thus written (Psalm 18:51) “He does kindness to his Me ssiah , to David and h is descendants until eternit y” – more than [when Israel was] in the desert. [The seventh v oice is] (Psalm 29:9), “God’s voice makes hinds to calf, strips the forests bare, and in His Temple, all say Glory.” It is thus written (Song of Song s 2:7) “I bind you with an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, with the hosts, or with the hinds of the field.” This teac hes us that the Torah was given with seven v oices. In each of them the Master of the universe revealed Him self to them, and they saw Him . It is thus written, “And all the people saw the voices.” 46. One verse states (2 Sam uel 22: 10), “He bent the heavens and came down, with gloo m under His feet.” Another verse says (Exodu s 19:20) “And God came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.” Still another verse, however, (Exodu s 20:22) states “From heaven I spoke to you. ” How is this reconciled? His “great fire” was on earth, and this was one voice. The other voices were in h eaven. It is thus written (Deuterono my 4:36 ) , “From the heavens He let you hear His voice, that He might instruct you. And on the earth He showed you His great fire, and His words you heard from the fire.” Which [fire] was that? It was the “great [fire” that was on the earth.] From where did the speech emanate? From this fire, as it is written, “and His words you heard from the fire.” 47.

A king stands before his servants wrappe d in a white robe. Even though h e is far away, they can still hear his voice. This is true even though they cannot see his throat when h e speaks. In a simi lar manner, they saw an image, but not an “entire im age”. It is therefore written, “You saw no form, only a voice.” It is also written (Deuterono my 4:12) “A voice of words you heard.” 48. One verse (Exodus 20:15), states, “and all the people saw the voices.” Another verse, however, (Deuterono my 4:12) states, “The voice of words you heard.” How can [the two be reconciled]? At first they saw the voices. What did the see? The seven v oices mentioned by David. But in the end they heard the word that emanated from them all. But we have learned that there were ten. Our sages taught that they were all said with a single word. But we have said that there were seven. There were seven v oices. Regarding three of them i t is written (Deuterono my 4:12) , “The voice of words you heard, but you saw no form, only a voice.” This teac hes us that they were all said with a single word. This is so that Israel should not make a mi stake and say, “Others helped h im. It might have been one of the angels. But His voice alone could not be so powerful.” It was for this reason that he came b ack and i nclude d them [in a single word]. 49. Another explanation: It was so that the world should not say that since there w ere ten sayings for ten kings, it might be that He could not speak for them all through one. He therefore said (Exodus 20:2), “I am [the Lord you God],” which included all ten. What are the ten kings? They are the seven v oices and three sayings (Amarim). What are the sayings? [They are the ones alluded to in the verse] (Deuterono my 26:18) “God has said for you today.” “W hat are the three? [Two are mentioned in the verse] (Proverbs 4:7 ), “The beginning is Wisdom: acquire W isdom, with all your acquisition, acquire Understanding .” It is thus written (Job 32 :8), “The sou l of Shaddai gives them Understanding .” The sou l of Shaddai is what gives them Understanding . What is the third one? As the old man said to the child, “Wh at is hidd en from you, do n ot seek, and what is concealed from you, do not probe. Where you have authority, seek to understand, but you have nothing to do with mysteries.” 50. We have learned (Proverbs 25:2), “The glory of God is to hide a word.” What is “a word”? That of which it is written (Psalm 119 :160 ), “The Beginning of Your word is truth.” [It is also written] (Proverbs 25:2), “The glory of kings is to probe a word.” What is this “word”? That of which it is written (Proverbs 25:11), “A word spoken in its proper place (Aphen-av) ”, do not read “its proper place” (Aphen-av), but “its wheel” (Ophen’av)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Bahir 14 51. The students asked Rabbi Berachiah, “Let us discuss these words with you,” but he would not give them permi ssion. Once, however, he did give them permissio n, but he did so to test them, to see i f they would now pay good attention . One day he tested them and said, “Let me hear your wisdom.” They began and said: “In the beginning” is one. [Two is] (Isaiah 57:16 ), “The spirit that unwraps itself is from Me, and I have m ade souls.” [Three is] (Psalm 65:10), “The divisions of God are filled with water.” What are these “divisions?” You taught us, our master, that God took the waters of creation and separated them, placing half in the skies and half in the ocea n. This is the meaning of “the divisions of God are filled with water.” Through them, man studies the Torah. Rabbi Chama thus taught: Beca use of the merit of deeds of kindness, a person can study the Torah. It is thus written (Isaiah 55:1 ), “Ho, let all who are thirsty come for water, let him without silver come, stock up and eat.” Go to Him, and He will do kindness with you, and you will “stock up a nd eat.” 52. “Let him without silver come” can also be explained in another way. Let him co me to God, for He has silver. It is thus written (Hagga i 2:8 ) , “Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold.” What is the meaning of the verse, “Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold”? What is this like? A king had two treasuries, one of silver, and one of gold. He place d that of silver to his right, and that of gold to his left. He s aid [of the silver], “This should be r eady, and easy to take out.” He keeps his words calm. He is attached to the poor and directs them calm ly. It is thus written (Exodu s 15:6) , “Your right hand, O God, is mighty in power.” If he rejoices in his portion, then all is well. If not, then (Exodu s 15:6), “Your right hand, O God, crumbles the enemy.” He said to them: This is referring to the gold. It is thus written, “Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold.” 53. Why is [gold] called Zaha v ? Because it includes three attributes, [allude d t o in its three letters, Zayin, Heh, Beth ]. [The first attribute is] Male, (Zachar) . This is the Zayin . [The second is] the Soul. This is the Heh. [The numerical value of Heh is five, alluding to] the five names of the soul: Nephesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chiah, Yechidah . What is the purpose the Heh ? It is a throne for the Zayin . It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 5:7 ), “For one above the other watches.” The Beth is its sustenance. It is thus written (Genesis 1:1 ), “In (Beth) the beginning [God] created... ” 54. What is its function here? What is this like? A king once had a daughter who was good, pleasant, beautiful and perfect. He married her to a royal prince, and clothed, crowned and bejewelled her, giving her much money. Is it possible for the king to ever leave his daughter? You will agree that it is not. Is it ever possible for him to be with h er constantly? You will also agree that it is not. What can h e"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Bahir 15 then do? He can place a window between the two, and whenever the father needs the daughter, or the daughter needs the father, they can come together through the window. It is thus written (Psalm 45:14) , “All glorious is the king’s daughter inside, her garment is interwoven with gold .” 55. What is the Beth at the end? [As it is written] (Proverbs 24:3), “With wisdom will the house (Bayit) be built.” The verse does not say “was built”, but “will be built”. In the future God will build and decorate it, thousands of tim es more than it was. It is as we have said: Why does the Torah b egin with a Beth ? As it is written (Proverbs 8:30) , “I was with Him as a craftsman, I was His delight for a d ay, a day, [frolicking before Him at every tim e].” These are the two thousand years, which are the “beginning”. Two? But the scripture says seve n, as it is written (Isaiah 30:26 ), “The light of the moo n shall be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold [like the light of the seven days.” And we said, “Just like the sun was for seven, so the moo n was for seven.” [He replied,] “I said thousands.” 56. They said to him: Up until now there a re five. What comes next? He replied: First I will explain gold. What is gold? We learn that it is where justice emanates. If you bend your words to the right or left, you will be punished. 57. What is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 30:26 ) , “The light of the moo n shall be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days.” The verse does not say “seven days,” but “ the seven days.” These a re the days regarding which it is written (Exodu s 31:17), “For six days God made [the heaven and the earth].” As you said, God made six b eautiful vessels. What are they? “ The heaven and the earth.” Are they not seven? Yes, as it is written (ibid.) “And on the seventh day, He rested and souled.” What is the meaning of “souled?” This teac hes us that the Sabbath sustains all sou ls. It is therefore written that it souled. 58. Another explanation: This teac hes us that it is from there that souls fly forth. It is thus written, “and He sou led.” This continues for a thousand generations. It is thus written (Psalm 105:8 ), “The word that He comm anded until a thousand generations.” Imm ediately after this it says, “[the covena nt] that He cut with Abraham .” What is the meaning of “cut”? He cut a covena nt between the ten fingers of his hands and the ten toes of his feet. Abraham was ashamed. God then said to him (Genesis 17:4 ), “And I, behold My covenant is with you,” and with it, “you will be the f ather of many nations.” 59. Why is heaven called Sha mayim? This teac hes that God kneaded fire and water, and combined them together. From this He made the “ beginning of His word.” It is thus written (Psalm 119:160 ), “The beginning of your word is truth.” It is therefore called Sha mayim – Sha m Mayim (there is water) – Esh Mayim (fire water). He said to them: This is the meaning of the verse (Job 25:2 ), “He makes peace in His"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Bahir 16 heights.” He placed peace and love b etween them. May He also place peace and love among us. 60. We also say (Psalm 119:164 ), “seven tim es each day I praised You for Your righteous judg ement.” They asked h im , “W hat are they?” He replied, “You do not loo k at it carefully. Be precise and you will find them.” 61. They asked h im , “W hat is the letter Tzadd i ?”” He said: Tzadd i is a Nun and a Yod . Its mate is also a Nun and a Yod . It is thus written (Proverbs 10:25 ), “The righteous (Tzadik) is the foundation of the world.” 62. They asked h im : What is the meaning of the verse [with regard to Balak and Balaam] (Numbers 23:14 ), “And he took him to the field of the s eers.”? What is the “field of the s eers”? As it is written (Song of Song s 7:12), “Come my belo ved, let us go o ut to the field.” Do not read Sad eh (the field), but Sidah (carriage). What is this carriage? He said, “The Heart of the Blessed Holy One.” His heart said to the Blesssed Holy One, “Come my b eloved, let us go out to the carriage to stroll. It will not constantly sit in one place.” 63. What is his heart? He said: If so, Ben Zoma is out side, and you are with him. The heart (Lev) [in n umerical value] is thirty-two. These are concea led, and with them the world was created. What these 32 ? He said: These are the 32 Paths. This is like a king who was in the innermost of many ch ambers. The number of such chambers was 32 , and to eac h one there was a path. Should the king the bring everyone to his chamber through these paths? You will agree that he shou ld not. Should he r eveal his jewels, his tapestries, his hidden and concealed secrets? You will again agree that he shou ld not. What then does he do? He touches the Daughter, and includes all the paths in her and in her garments. One who wants to go inside shou ld gaze there. He married her to a king, and also gave her to him as a gift. Beca use of his l ove for he, he sometim es calls her “my sister,” since they are both from one place. Sometim es he calls her his daughter, since she is actually his daughter. And sometim es he calls her “my mother.” 64. Furthermore, if there is no wisdom, then there is no justice. It is thus written (1 Kings 5:26 ), “And God gave wisdom to S olom on.” He then judg ed the case [of the two mothers and the infant] correctly, and it is then written (1 Kings 3:28), “And all Israel o f the judg ement that the Kind had judg ed, and they feared the king, for they say that the wisdom o f God was in him to do judg ement.” 65. And what wisdom did God give to Solomon ? Solo mon h ad God’s name. We have thus said that whenever S olomon is mentioned in the Song of Song s, it is a holy name, except in one cas e. God said to him, “Since your name is like the name of My Glory, I will let you marry m y"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Bahir 17 daughter.” But she is married! Let us say that He gave h er to him as a gift. It is thus written (1 Kings 5:26), “And God gave wisdom to Solomon.” Here, however, it is not explained. Where then is it explained? When the scripture states (1 Kings 3:28), “For they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judg ement.” We then see that the wisdom that God gave him was such that he could “do judg ement.” What is the meaning of “to do judg ement?” As long as a person does judg ement, God’s wisdom is inside him . This is what helps him and draws him near. If not, it repels him, and not only that, but it also pun ishes him. It is thus written (Leviticus 26:28 ), “I will chastise you, also I.” 66. And Rabbi Rahumai said: What is the me aning of the verse (Leviticus 26:28 ), “[I will chastise you,] also I”? God said, “I will chastise you.” The Congregation of Israel said, “Do not think that I will seek mercy for you, but I will chastise you. Not only will I render judg em ent, but I will a lso chastise you.” 67. What is the meaning of (Leviticus 26:28), “[I will chastise you, also I], seven for your sins”? The Congregation of Israel said: “I will chastise you, also I” – and also those regarding which it is written (Psalm 119:164 ) , “Seven each day I praised You.” They jo ined her and replied: Also us seven. Even though among us is the o ne who reverses itself, the one who oversee s goo d and merit, we too will reverse ourselves and chastise. Why? Because of your sins. But if you return to Me, then I will return to you. It is thus written (Malachi 3:7 ), “Return to Me, and I will return to you.” The scripture does not say, “I will bring you back to Me.” Instead it says, “I will return to you” – with you. We will all seek mercy fro m the King. What does the King say? [He says] (Jeremiah 3:22 ), “Return you backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings.” [He also says] (Ezekiel 18:30 ), “Return and bring back.” What is the meaning of the verse, “Return and bring back ”? Come b ack and ask those S eve n to return with you. The scripture therefore says, “and bring back “ – those regarding which it is written, “seven for your sin.” 68. The disciples asked Rabbi Rahumai: What is the meaning of the verse (Haba kkuk 3:1 ), “A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, for errors.” A prayer? It should be called a praise [since it speaks of God’s greatness]. But whoever turns his heart from worldly affairs and delves in the Works of the Chariot * is acce pted before God as if he prayed all day. It is therefore called “a prayer.” What is the meaning of “for errors”? As it is written [regarding wisdom] (Proverbs 5:19 ), “W ith its love you shall always err.” Regarding what is this spea king? The Works of the Chariot, as it is written (Habba kuk 3:2)   * i.e “ Maaseh Merkavah” or Merkavah Mysticism which Kaplan says was synonymous with the Qabalah at the tim e the Bahir was first composed."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Bahir 18 “O God, I heard a r eport of You and I fear ed.” 69. What is the meaning of, “I heard a report of You and I feared, [O God, bring t o life Your works in the midst of the years]”? Why does the verse say “I feared” after “I heard a report of You,” and not after “in the mi dst of the years”? But it was “from the report of You” that “I feared.” What is the “report of You”? It is the place where they listen to reports. Why does the verse say “I heard” and not “I understood”? [The word “heard” has the connotation of understanding] as we find (Deuteronomy 38:49 ), “A nation whose language you do not hear.” 70. Why did he say “I feared”? Because the ear looks like the letter Aleph . The Aleph is the first of all letters. Besides this, the Aleph causes all the letters to endure. The Aleph loo ks like the brain. When you mention the Aleph you open your mouth. The same is true of thought, when you extend your thoughts to the Infinite and Boundless. From Aleph emanate all letters. Do we not see that it is first? It is thus written (Micah 2:13), “God (YHVH) is at their head.” We have a r ule that every Name that is written Yod He Vav He is specific to the Blessed Holy O ne and is sanctified with h oliness. What is the meaning of “with h oliness”? This is the Holy Palace . Where is the Holy Palace? W e wou ld say that it is in thought and in the Aleph . This is the meaning of the verse, “I heard a report of You and I feared.” 71. Habakkuk therefore said: I know that my prayer is acce pted with delight. I also delighted when I cam to that place where I understood “a report of You and I feared.” Therefore, “Bring to life your works in the mi dst of the years” – through Your unity. What is this like? A king who was talented, hidden and concealed went into his house and comm anded that no o ne seek him. One who d oes seek is therefore afraid, lest the king f ind out that he has violated the king’s order. [Habakkuk ] therefore said, “I feared, O God, bring to life Your works in the mi dst of the years.” This is what Habakkuk said: Because You name is in You, and You is Your name, “bring to life Your works in the mi dst of the years.” Thus will it be forever. 72. Another explanation of “Bring to life Your works in the mi dst of years”: What is this like? A king had a beautiful pearl, and it was the treasure of his kingd om. When he is happy, he embraces it, kisses it, places it on h is head, and loves it. Habakkuk said: Even though Kings are with You, the beloved pearl is in Your world. Therefore, “Bring to life Your works in the mi dst of years.” What is the meaning of “years”? It is written (Genesis 1:3 ), “And God said, ‘Let there b e light.’” Light is nothing other than day, as it is written (Genesis 1:16) , “The great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night.” Years are ma de from days. It is thus written, “Bring to life Your works in the midst of years” – in the midst of that pearl that gives rise to years."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Bahir 19 73. But it is written (Isaiah 43:5 ), “[Fear not, for I am wit h you,] I will bring your seed from the east.” The sun rises in the east, and y ou say that t he pearl is day. [He replied:] I am only speaking with regard t o the v erse (Genesis 1:5) “And it was evening and it was morning, day.” Regarding this it is written (Genesis 2:4), “In the day that God made earth a nd heave n .” 74. And it is written (Psalm 18:12), “He made darkness His hiding place round about, His Succah the darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies (Shechakim) .” He said: Regarding this it is written (Isaiah 45: 8), “The skies (Shechakim) pour down righteousness.” This righteousness (Tzadik) is the Attribute of Judg ement for the world. It is thus written (Deuteronomy 16:20), “Righteousness, righteousness shall you pu rsue.” Imm ediately after this, it is written, “that you may live and occupy the land.” If you judg e yourself, then you will live. If not, then it will j udg e you, and it will be fulfilled, even against your will. 75. Why does the Torah say “righteousness, righteousness” twice? He said: Because the scripture continues (Psalm 18:13) , “At the glow opposite Him.” The first “righteousness” is literal righteousness (Tzedek). This is the Divine Presence [i.e Shekinah ] . It is thus written (Isaiah 1:21), “Righteousness dwells in it.” What is the second “righteousness”? This is the righteousness that frightens the righteous . Is this righteousness charity (Tzada kah) or not? He said that it is not. Why? Because it is written (Isaiah 59:17 ), “He put on righteousness like a coat of ma il, and [a helm et of salvation on His head].” His head is nothing other than Truth. It is thus written (Psalm 119 L160 ), “The head of Your word is truth.” Truth is nothing other than peace . It is thus written [that King Heze kiah said] (Isaiah 39:8 ), “There shall be peace and truth in my days.” Is it possible for a man to say this? But this is what Heze kiah said: The attribute that You gave to David my ancestor is half of my days, and peace and truth are half of my days. It is for this reason that he mentioned “my days.” He mentioned both “peace and truth” and “in m y days,” since it is all one. It is thus written (Genesis 1:5), “And it was evening, and it was morning, one day.” [The day reconciles morning and evening, and is therefore peace .] Just as the day is peace, so he chose p eace . It is therefore written (2 Kings 20:19 ), “Peace and truth shall be in my days.” This shall be through the attribute that You gave t o David. Regarding t his, it is written (Psalm 89:37), “His throne shall be like the sun before Me.” 76. What is the meaning of the verse (Haba kkuk 3:2), “In the m idst of years make it known”? He said: I know that You are the holy God, as it is written (Exodu s 15:11 ), “Who is like You, mi ghty in h oliness?” Holiness is in You and You are in h oliness. Nevertheless, “in the midst of years make it known.” What is the meaning of “make it known”? [This means] that You should have mercy. It is thus written (Exodu s 2:25), “And God saw the children of Israel, and God knew .”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Bahir 20 What is the meaning of, “and God knew”? What is this like? A king had a beautiful wife, and had children from her. He loved them and raised them, but they went out to bad ways. He then h ated both them and their mother. The mother went to them and said, “My children! Why do you do this: Why do you make your father hate both you and me?” [She spoke to them in this manner] until they had remorse and did the will of their father. When the king saw this, he loved them as much as he did in the beginning. He then also remembered their mother. This is the meaning of the verse, “And God saw... and God knew.” This is also the meaning of the verse, “In the mi dst of years make it known.” 77. What is the meaning of the verse (Haba kkuk 3:2) “In anger, you shall remember love (rachem)” ? He said: When Your children sin b efore You and You are angry at them, “remember love.” What is the meaning of “remember love”? That regarding which it is written (Psalm 18:2), “I love (rachem) You O God, my strength.” And You have him this attribute, which is the Divine Presence of Israel. He recalled his son whom he inherited, and whom You gave to him. It is thus written (I Kings 5:26), “And God gave wisdom to Solomon.” And You shou ld remember their father Abraham, as it is written (Isaiah 41:8 ), “The seed of Abraham My friend” – “In the mi dst of years make it known.” 78. Where do we see that Abraham had a daughter? It is written (Genesis 24:1), “And God blessed Abraham wit h all (Bakol) .” It is also written (Isaiah 43:7 ), “ All that is called by My name, for My glory I created it, I formed it, also I made it.” Was this blessing his daughter, or was it not? Yes, it was his daughter. What is this like? A king had a slave who was complete and perfect before him. The king tested the slave in many ways, but the slave withstood all temptation. The King said, “W hat will I give that slave? What shou ld I do for him ? I can do nothing but comm and my o lder brother to advise him , watch over him and honour him.” The slave thus went to the older brother and learned h is attributes. The brother loved him very much, and called h im his friend. It is thus written (Isaiah 41:8 ), “The seed of Abraham My friend.” He said, “W hat will I give him? W hat can I do for him ? Behold I have made a beautiful vessel, and in it are beautiful jewels. There is nothing like it in the treasuries of kings. I will give it to him, and he will be worthy in his place. ” This is the meaning of the verse, “And God blessed Abraham w i th all.” 79. Another explanation: [It is written] (Haba kkuk 3:2), “I heard a report of You and I feared.” [This means] “I understood what was reported about You and I feared.” What did he understand? He understood God’s though. Even [human] though h as no end, for man can think, and descend to the end of the world. The ear also has no end and is not satiated.

Aleph is the root of the Ten"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Bahir 21 Comm andments. Therefore “the ear is not satiated from hearing .” 80 What is the meaning of the letter Zayin in the word Ozen (ear)? We have said that everything that the Blessed Holy One brought into His world has a name emanating form i ts concept. It is thus written (Genesis 2:19), “All that the man called each living soul, that was its name.” This teac hes us that eac h thing’s bod y was thus. And how do we know that eac h thing’s name is its bod y? It is written (Proverbs 10:7) , “The memory o f the righteous shall be a b lessing, and the name of the wicked shall rot.” What actually rots, their name or their bod y? [One must agree that it is their bod y.] Here too, [each thing’s name refers to] its body . 81What is an example of this? Take the word for root – Sho resh (Shin – Resh – Shin). The letter Shin loo ks like the roots of a tree. [ Resh is bent, since] the root of every tree is bent. And what is the function of the final Shin? This teac hes us that if you take a branch a nd plant it, it will root again. What is its function of the Zayin [in Ozen – ear]? [Its numerical value is seve n] correspon ding to the s even days of the w eek. This teac hes u s that eac h day has its own power. And what is its function [in the word Ozen ]? This teac hes us that just like there is infinite wisdom i n the ear, so is there power in all parts of the bod y. 82 What art the seven parts of man’s bod y? It is written (Genesis 9:6), “In the form of God, He made man.” It is also written (Genesis 1:27), “In the form o f God He made him” – counting all his limbs and parts. But we have said: What does the letter Vav resemble? It is alluded to in the verse (Psalm 104 :5), “He spreads out light like a g arment.” For Vav is nothing other than the six directions. He replied: The covena nt of circumc ision a nd man’s mate a re consider ed as one. His is two hands then make three, his head and bod y, five, and his two legs make seve n. Paralleling all these are their powers in h eave n. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 7:14) , “Also one opposite the other had God made.” These are the days [of the w eek, as it is written] (Exodu s 31:17), “Beca use six days God made the heaven and the earth.” The s cripture does not say “in six days,” but rather, “six days.” This teac hes us that eac h day [of the week] has its own specific power. 83 What is the significance of the Nun [in the word Ozen ]? This teac hes us that the brain is the main part of the spinal cord . It constantly draws from there, and if not for the spinal cord, the brain cou ld not endure. And without the brain, the bod y cou ld not endure. The entire body exists only i n order to provide for the needs of the brain. And if the bod y did not endure, then the brain wou ld also not endure. The spinal cord is the channel from the brain to the entire bod y. It is rep resented by the bent Nun . But [in the word Ozen ] the Nun is a straight one."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Bahir 22 The straight Nun is the one that is always at the end of a word. This teac hes us that t he straight Nun includes both the bent one and the straight one. But the bent Nun is the Foundation. This teac hes us that the straight Nun includes both male and female. 84. The open Mem . What is the open Mem ? It includes both male and fema le. What is the closed Mem ? It is made like a belly from above. But Rabbi Rahumai said that the belly is like the letter Teth . He said it is like a Teth on the inside, while I say that it is like a Mem on the outside. 85 What is a Mem ? Do not read Mem, but Mayim (water). Just like water is wet, so is the belly always wet. Why does the open Mem include both male and fema le, while the closed Mem is male? This teac hes us that the Mem is prim arily male. The opening was then added to it for the sake of the female. Just like the male cannot give birth, so the closed Mem cannot give birth. And just like the female has an opening with which to give birth, so can the open Mem give birth. The Mem is therefore open and closed. 86. Why shou ld the Mem have two forms, open and closed? Beca use we said: Do not read Mem, but Mayim (Water). The woman is cold, and therefore, must be warmed b y the male. Why shou ld the Nun have two forms, bent and straight? Beca use it is written (Psalm 72:17), “Before the sun shall his name reign (ya-Nun). ” [This is] from two Nuns, the bent Nun and the straight Nun , and it must be through male and female. 87. It is written (Ecclesiastes 1:8), “The ear is not satiated from hearing .” It is also written (Ecclesiastes 1:8), ”The eye is not satiate from seeing.” This teac hes us that both draw from thought. What is thought? It is a king that is needed by all things that were c reated in the world, both above and below. 88. What is the meaning of the expression, “It rose in thought”? Why do we not say that “i t descended [in thought]”? Indeed, we have said, “One who gaze s into the vision of the Chariot first descends and then ascends.” We use the expression [of descent] there b eca use w e say, “One who gaze s into the vision (Tzafayat) of the Chariot.” The Aramaic translation of “vision” (Tzafiyat ) is Sechuta [meaning a covering, and alluding to the f act that one is loo king down from above]. It is also written (Isaiah 21:8 ), “And he called as a lion: ‘Upon the w atchtower (Mitzpeh), O G od.’” Here, however, we are spea king of thought, [and therefore only spea k of ascent]. For thought does not include any visio n, and has no ending whatsoever. And anything that has no end or lim it does not have any descent. People therefore say, “Someone descended to the lim it of his friend’s knowledge.” One can"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Bahir 23 arrive at the lim it of a person’s knowledge, but not at the limit of his thought . 89. Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the Segol ? Its name is Segulah (treasure). It comes after the Zarka. What is the meaning of Zarka? It is like its name – something that is thrown (ni Zrak). It is like something that is thrown, and after it comes (Ecclesiastes 2:8), “the treasures of kings and lands.” 90. What is the reason that it is called Zarka? It is written (Ezekiel 3:12), “Blessed is the glory of God from His place .” This indicates that no being knows His place . We r ecite [God’s] name of the Crown, and it goes to the head of the Ow ner. It is thus written [regarding God] (Genesis 14:19), “Ow ner of heaven and earth.” When it goes, it is like it is thrown (Zarka) . Following it is treasure (Segulah). It is at the head of all letters. 91. Why is [this accent] at the end of a word, and not at the b eginni ng? This teac hes us that this Crown rises higher and h igher. It is included and crowned, as it is written (Psalm 118 :22), “The stone that the builders rejected has become the head cornerstone.” It ascend to the place from which it was graven, as it is written (Genesis 49:24) , “From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel. ” 92. He also said: What is the reason that we place blue woo l in the Tzitzit ? And why are there 32 [threads]? What is this like? A king had a beautiful garden, and in it were 32 paths. He placed a watchman over them to show that all these paths belong to him alone. [The king] said t o him, “Watch them, and walk up on them every day. As l ong as you walk these p aths, you will have peace .” What did the watchman do? He app ointed other watchmen [as h is assistants to watch] over them. He said, “If I rem ain alone on these p aths, it is impossible for me, a single w atchman, to maintain them all. Besides that, people may say that I am the king.” The watchman therefore place d h is assistants over all the paths. These are the 32 paths. 93. What is the reason for the blue? The watchman said, “Perhaps those assistant watchmen will say that the g arden belongs to us.” He therefore gave them a sign, and told them, “See this. It is the sign of the king, indicating that the garden b elongs to him . He is the one who made these p aths, and they are not mi ne. This is his deal.” What is this like? A king and h is daughter had slaves, and they wanted to travel abroad. But [the slaves] were afraid, being in terror of the king. He therefore gave them his sign. They were also afraid of the daughter, and she [also] gave them a sign. They said, “From now on, with these two signs, ‘God will watch you from all evil, He will safeguard your soul.’” 94. Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (1 Kings 8:27 ), “Behold the heaven and the heaven of heaven cannot contain You”? This teac hes us that the Blessed Holy One has 72 names. All o f them were place d in the Tribes [of Israel]. It is thus written (Exodu s 28:10), “Six of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Bahir 24 their names on one stone, and the names of the other six on the other stone, acc ording to their generations.” It is also written (Joshua 4:9 ), “He raised up twelve stones.” Just like the first are (Exodu s 28:12), “stones of memorial,” so these are (Joshua 4:7 ), “stones of memorial.” [There are therefore] 12 stones [each containing six nam es] making a total of 72 . These parallel the 72 names of the Blessed Holy One. Why do they begin with twelve? This teac hes us that God has twelve Directors. Each of these has six Powers [making a total of 72]. What are they? They are the 72 languages. 95. The Blessed Holy One has a single Tree, and it has twelve diagonal boundaries: The northeast boundary, the southeast boundary; The upp er east boundary, the lower east boundary; The southwest boundary, the northwest boundary; The upp er west boundary, the lower west boundary; The upp er south b oundary, the lower south b oundary; The upp er north b oundary, the lower north b oundary; They cont inually spread forever and ever; They are the arms of the world. On the inside of them is the Tree. Paralleling these diagonals there are twelve Functionaries. Inside the Sphere there are also twelve Functionaries. Including the diagonals themselves, this makes a total o f 36 Functionaries. Each of these has another. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 5:7), “For one above another watches.” [This makes a total of 72.] It therefore comes out that the east has nine, the w est has nine, the north h as nine, and the south h as nine. These are twelve, twelve, twelve, and they are the Functionaries in the Axis , the Sphere, and the Heart. Their total is 36. The power of eac h of these 36 is in every other one. Even though there are twelve in each of the three, they are all attach ed t o eac h other. Therefore, all 36 Powers are in the first one, which is the Axis. And if you seek them in the Sphere, you will find the very same ones. And if you seek them in the Heart, you will again find the very same ones. Each one therefore has 36. All o f them do not have more than 36 forms. All o f them co mplete the Heart [which h as a numerical value of 32 ]. Four are then left over. Add 32 to 32 and the sum i s 64. These are the 64 Forms . How do we know that 32 must be adde d t o 32 ? Beca use it is written (Ecclesiastes 5:7) , “For one above another watches, [and there a re higher ones above them].” We thus have 64, eight less than the 72 names of the Blessed Holy One. These are allude d t o in the verse, “there are higher ones above them,” and they are the seven d ays of the week. But one is s till missing. This is referred to in the next verse (Ecclesiastes 5:8), “The advantage of the land in everything is the King.” What is this “advantage”? This is the place from which the earth was graven. It is an advantage over what existed previously. And what is this advantage? Everything in the world that people see is taken from i ts radiance. Then it is an advantage."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Bahir 25 96. What is the earth from which the h eave ns were graven? It is the Throne of the Blessed Holy One . It is the Precious Stone and the S ea of Wisdom. This parallels the blue in the Tzitzit. Rabbi Meir thus said: Why is blue chosen a bove all other colours [for the Tzitzit]? Beca use the blue resembles the sea, the sea resembles the sky,l and the sky resembles the Throne of Glory. It is thus written (Exodu s 24:10), “They saw the God of Israel, and under His feet was like a pavem ent of sapphire, like the essence of heaven in clarity.” It is furthermore written (Ezekiel 1:26) , “As the likeness of a sapphire stone was the app ear ance of a Throne.” 97. Rabbi Berachiah sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 25:2), “And they shall take for Me a lifted offering (Terumah) ”? It means, “Lift Me up with y our prayers.” And whom? Those whose “hearts make them willing .” These a re the o nes who are willing t o draw themselves away fro m this world. Honour him , for it is in him that I rejoice, since he knows My name. From him i t is fitting to take My lifted offering, as it is written (Exodu s 25:2), “from each man whose heart makes him willing, you shall take My lift ed offering.” From he who makes him self willing. Rabbi Rahumai said: [This refers to] the righteous and pious in Israel who raise Me over all the world through their merit. From them the Heart is sustained, and the H eart sustains them. 98. And all the Holy Forms oversee all the nations. But Israel is holy, taking the Tree itself and its Heart. The Heart is the beauty (hada r) of the fruit of the bod y. Similarly, Israel takes (Leviticus 23:40), “the fruit of a beautiful (had ar) tree.” The date palm is s urrounded by its branch es all around it and has its sprout (Lulav) in the centre. Similarly, Israel takes the body o f this Tree which is its Heart. And parall eling the body is the spinal cord, which is the main part of the body. What is the Lulav ? [It can b e written] Lo Lev – “it has a heart.” The heart is also given over to it. And what is this Heart? It is the 32 Hidden paths of Wisdom that are hidden in it. In each of their paths there is also a Form watching over it. It is thus written (Genesis 3:24) , “To watch the way of the Tree of Life.” 99. What are these Forms? They are that regarding which it is written (Genesis 3:24), “And He place d the Cherubim to the east of the G arden of Eden, and the flame of a sword revolving, to guard the way of the Tree of Life.” What is the meaning of, “He place d to the east (kedem) of the Garden of Eden”? He place d it in those paths that prece ded (kadmu) the place that was called the Garden of Eden. It was also before the Cherubim, as it is written, “the Cherubim.” It was furthermore before the flame, as it is written, “the flame of a sword revolving.” Is it then before [the flame]? Heaven is called Sha mayim , indicating that fire and water existed before it. It is written (Genesis 1:6), “Let there be a firmam ent in the mi dst of the waters, and let it be a div ision b etween water and water.” It is then written (Genesis 1:8), “And God called the firmament heaven (Sha mayim). ” How do we know that the heaven is fire? It is written (Deuterono my 4:24), “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.”"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Bahir 26 100 . And how do we know that “” refers to the Blessed Holy One ? It is written (1 Kings 8:36), “And you, O Heaven , shall hear.” Was Solomon then praying to heaven that it should hear their prayers? But [we must say the he was praying] to the One whose name is Heaven. It is thus written (1 Kings 8:27), “Behold the heaven and the heaven of heaven cannot contain You.” This is the name of the Blessed Holy One . You therefore have fire. How can you then say that it was before? But we must say that their P ower existed before the Forms of that place. Only then did thes e Holy Forms come into existence. What is their P ower? It is that regarding which it is writte n (I Samuel 2:2), “There is none holy like God, there is none other than You, and there is no Former like our God. ” 101 . Rabbi Berachiah sat and expounded: What is the Lulav that we discusses? It is the 36 (Lu) given o ver to 32 (Lav). And how? He replied: There are three Princes, the Axis, the Sphere and the Heart. Each one is twelve, and the three therefore constitute a sum of 36 , through which the world is s ustained. It is thus written (Proverbs 10:25), “And Righteous is the foundation of the world.” 102 . We learned: There is a single pillar extending from heaven to earth, and its name is Righteous (Tzadik) . [This pillar] is named after the righteous. When there are righteous people in the world, then it becomes strong, and when there a re not, it beco mes weak. It supports the entire world, as it is written, “And Righteous is the foundation of the world.” If it becomes weak, then the world cannot endure. Therefore, even if there is only one righteous person in the world, it is he who supp orts the world. It is therefore written, “And a righteous one is the foundation of the world.” You should therefore take My lifted offering from him first. Then (Exodu s 25:3), “And this is the lifted offering that you shou ld take from them” – from the rest. What is it? “ Gold , silver and copper.” 103 . Another explanation: It is written (Exodu s 25:2) , “and the shall take for Me (Li) a lifted offering.” [ Li (for Me) can also be read, “for the Yod. ”] They shall take the Yod , which is the tenth, as a lifted offering to make it holy. How do we know that the tenth is holy? Beca use it is written (Leviticus 27:32) “The tenth shall be holy to God.” What is holy? That regarding which it is written (Ezekiel 44:30), “The beginning of all the first fruits ... and every lifted offering of every thing.” It is furthermore written (Psalm 111 :10) , “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.” Do not read “is the fear” but “and the fear.” [The verse will then read, “The beginning is wisdom and the fear of God.] 104 . The disciples asked Rabbi Eliezer: Our master, what is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 13:2), “Sanctify to Me every first-born”? Does the Blessed Holy O ne then h ave a first-born? He replied: “Sanctify to Me (Li) every first-born” refers to nothing other than the s econd"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Bahir 27 level of holiness. It is the name that is given to Israel, as it is written (Exodu s 7:22), “My son, My first-born, Israel.” To the extent t hat we ca n express it, He was with them [in Egypt] in the tim e of their oppression. It is therefore written (Exodu s 4:27), “Send forth My son and he will serve Me.” [Here, only “My son” is mentioned,] and not “My first-born.” Rabbi Rahumai said: What is the meaning of the verse (Deuterono my 22:7), “You shall surely send away the mother, and the children you shall take for yourself.” Why does it n ot say, “You shall surely send away the father”? But the scripture says, “you shall surely send away the mother” in honour of the one who i s called the Mother of the World. It is thus written (Proverbs 2:3), “For you shall call Understanding a Mother.” 105 . What is the meaning of, “and the children you shall take for yourself”? Rabbi Rahumai said: These are the children that she raised. And who are they? They are the seven days of creation, and the seven days of Succot . Are the seven [days of Succot ] then n ot the same as the seve n days of the w eek? The difference is that [the days of Succot ] are more holy. Regarding them i t is written (Leviticus 23:37), “holy convocations.” But then, why not [also include the seven weeks before] Shavuot, since this is also called (Leviticus 23:21), “a holy convocation”? He replied: Yes, but this is the one and the other is two. It is thus written (Exodu s 12:16), “The first day shall be a holy convocation, and the seve nth day shall be a holy convocation.” He said: Why is Sha vuot one [day]? Beca use the Torah was given to Israel on that day. And when the Torah was created in the beginning, the Blessed Holy One ruled His world alone with it. It is thus written (Psalm 111 :10), “The beginning is wisdom, the fear of God.” [God] said [to it], “This being so, your holiness shall be yours by y ourself.” And what is Succot? He replied: the le tter Beth [which h as the conn otation of a house (Bayit) ]. It is thus written (Proverbs 24:3), “W ith wisdom a house is built.” And how do we know that Succot has the conn otation of a house? As it is written (Genesis 33:17) , “And Jacob travelled to Succot. He built him self a house, and for his livestock h e built Succot (huts). Therefore he named the place Succot.” 106 . Rabbi Berachiah sat and expounded: What is the Axis (Teli) ? This is the likeness that is before the Blessed Holy One . It is thus written (Song of Song s 5:11), “His locks are curled (Taltalim). ” What is the Sphere? This is the Womb. What is the Heart? It is that regarding which it is written (Deuterono my 4:11) , “unto the heart of heaven.” In it are included the 32 mystical paths of Wisdom. 107 .

May God"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Bahir 28 (YHVH) lift His face to you and give you peace. ” This is the explicit Name of the Blessed Holy One. It is the Name containi ng twelve letters, as it is written, YHVH YHVH YHVH. This teac hes us that God’s names consists of three troops. Each troop resembles the other, and each one’s name is like [the other’s] named. All of them are sealed with Yod He Vav He . And how? The [four letters] Yod He Vav He can b e permuted 24 different ways, formi ng one troop. This is, “May God (YHVH) bless you... ” In a simi lar manner, the second one, “May God (YHVH) make His face shine... ” These are 24 names of the Blessed Holy One. In a simi lar manner, the third one, “May God (YHVH) lift His face ...” These are 24 names of the Blessed Holy One. This teac hes us that eac h army, with its leaders and officers, has 24. Multiply 24 b y three and you have the 72 names of the Blessed Holy One. These are the 72 names derived from the v erses (Exodus 14:19-21), “And travelled... And came ... And stretched ...” 108 . And who are the Officers? W e learned that there are three. Strength (Geburah) is the Officer of all the Holy Forms to the left of the Blessed Holy On e . He is Gabriel. The Officer of all the Holy Forms to His right is Michael . In the middle is Truth. This is Uriel, the Officer of all the Holy Forms [in the centre]. Each Officer is over 24 Forms. But there is no reckoning of his troops, as it is written (Job 25:3), “Is there a number to His troops?” But if so, then there are 72 plus 72 [making a total of 144] . He said: This is not the cas e. For when Israel brings a s acrifice before their Father in h eaven, they are united together. This is the unification of our God. 109 . Why is this sacrifice called a Karban [which means “bringing close”]? Beca use it brings the Forms of the Holy Powers close. It is thus written (Ezekiel 37:17) , “And you shall jo in one of them to the other, making one stick, and they shall become one in your hands.” And why is [the sacrifice] called a “pleasant fragrance”? Fragrance is only in the nose. The sense of smell is through b reath, and this is nowhere but in the nose. “Pleasant” (nicho’ach) means nothing other than “descending.” It is thus written (Leviticus 9:22), “And he descended,” and the Targum translates this as Ve-Nachit [having the same root as nicho’ach ]. The fragrance-spirit descends and un ifies itself with t hose Holy Forms, bringing itself close through the sacrifice. It is for this reason that [a sacrifice] is called a Karban . 110 . There is a name that is derived from the three verses (Exodu s 14:19-21) , “And travelled ... And came ... And stretched... ” The letters of the first verse, “And travelled... ” are a rranged in this name in the order that they are in the verse.

Rabbi Ahilai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse, “God (YHVH) is King, God (YHVH) was king, God (YHVH) will be King forever and ever.”? This is the Explicit Name (Shem Ha Mepho resh) , for which permi ssion was given that it be permuted and spoken. It is thus written [regarding the above-mentioned Priestly Blessing ] (Numbers 6:27) , “And they shall place My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.” This refers to the Name containing twelve letters. It is the name used in the Priestly Blessing, “May God bless you... ” It contains three nam es [eac h h aving four letters] making a total of twelve. Its vowel points are Yapha ’al Y’pha ’oel Yiph’ol. If one safeguards it and mentions it in h oliness, then all his prayers are heard. And not only that, but he is loved on high and below, and imm ediately answered and helped. This is the Explicit Name that was written on Aaron’s forehead. The Explicit Name containi ng 72 letters and the Explicit Name containing twelve letters were given over by the Blessed Holy One to [the angel] Mesamariah, who stands before the Curtain. He gave it to Elijah on Mount Carmel, and with them he ascended and did n ot taste death. 112 . These are the Explicit Holy Exalted Names. There a re twelve Names, one for eac h of the twelve tribes of Israel: Ah-Tzitzah-ron Aklithah-ron Shemaqtharon Demushah-ron Ve-Tzaphtzaphithron Hurmyron Brach Yah-ron Eresh Gadra-aon Basavah Monahon Chazhavayah Havahayryhah"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Bahir 30 Ve-Harayth-hon All o f them are included in the Heart of heaven. They include male and female. They are given over to the Axis, the Sphere and the H eart, and they are the wellsprings of Wisdom. 113 . Rabbi Rahumai sat and expounded: What are the twelve tribes or Israel? But this teac hes us that the Blessed Holy One has twelve rods [on high. The word Sheve t is the same for both “tribe” and “rod.”] What are they? What is this like? A king had a beautiful fountain. All his brothers has no water other than this fountain, and could not endure thirst. What did he do? He made twelve pipes for th e fou ntain, and named them afters his brothers’ children. He then said to them, “If the sons are as goo d as their fathers, they will be worthy, and I will let water flow through the pipes. The fathers will then drink all they wish, and so will the sons. But if the sons are not worthy and do not do what is right in m y ey es, then regarding this, these pipes will stand. I will give them water only on the con dition that they give none to their children, since they do not obey my will.” 114 . What is the meaning of the word Sheve t [which h as the conn otation of both a tribe and a rod]? It is something simp le and not square. What is the reason? Beca use it is im possible to have one square inside another square. A circle inside a s qu are can move. A square inside a square cannot move. 115 . What are the things that are circular? They are the vowel po ints in the Torah of Moses, for these are all round. They are to the letters like the soul, which lives in the bod y of man. It is impossible for [man] to come [into this world] unless [the soul] endu res within h im . It is impossible for him to speak anything, great or small, without it. In a simi lar manner, it is im possible to speak a word, great or small, without the vowel points. 116 . Every vowel point is round, and every letter is square. The vowel po ints are the life of the letters, and through them, the letters endure. These vowel points come through the pipes to the letters through the fragrance of a sacrifice, which immediately descends. It is therefore called “A descending (pleasant) fragrance to God” – indicating that it descends to God. This is the meaning of the verse (Deuterono my 6:4) , “Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.” 117 . Rabbi Yochanan said: What is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 15:3) , “God is a man (Ish) of war, God (YHVH) is His name”? Man (Ish) indicates a sign. The Targum thus renders, “God is a man of war,” as “God is the Master of victory in war.”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Bahir 31 What is this Ma ster? Aleph is the first, the Holy Palace.

They are the Torah of Truth, which includes all worlds. What is the Shin ? He said: It is the root of the tree. The letter Shin is like the root of a tree. 119 . What is this tree that you mentioned? He said: It represents the Powers of the Blessed Holy One , one above the other. Just like a tree brings forth fruit through water, so the Blessed Holy O ne increases the Powers of the Tree through water. What is the water of the Blessed Holy One ? It is wisdom. It is the souls of the righteous. They fly from the fountain to the great pip, ascend and attach themselves to the Tree. Through what do they fly? Through Israel. Whey they are goo d and righteous, the Divine Presence dwells among them. Their deeds then rest in the bosom of the Blessed Holy One , and He makes them fruit ful and multiplies them. 120 . How do we know that the Divine Presence is called Tzedek (Righteous)? It is written (Deuteronomy 33:26), “He who rides in the heavens is your help, and His majesty is in the skies (Shechakim). ” It is also written (Isaiah 45: 8) , “The skies (Shechakim) run with Righteousness (Tzedek) .” Tzedek is the Divine Presence, as it is written (Isaiah 1:21), “Righteousness (Tzedek) dwells in it.” Righteousness was given to David, as it is written, (Psalm 146 :10) , “May God reign forever, your God O Zion, for generation to generation.” It is also written (1 Chronicles 11:1) , “Zion is the city o f David.” 121 . What is the meaning of “generation to generation”? Rabbi Papias said: “A generation goes and a generation comes (Ecclesiastes 1:4) .” Rabbi Akiba said: “The generation came” – it already came. 122 . What is this like? A king had slaves, and he dress ed them w i th garments of silk and satin acc ording to his ability.

The king took the garments, and washed them well until there was not a single spot on them. He place d them wit h his storekeep ers, bought o ther slaves, and dressed them with the same garments.

Did he not already descent? But he d escended “from m aking the sin offering , the burnt offering, and the peace offerings,” and then “A aron raised up his hands to bless the people.” What is the meaning of this raising [of hands]?

Those who o ffer sacrifice must elevate them, [and those who] unify them [must] unify them among these. And; what are they?

It is beca use the hands have ten fingers, alluding to the Ten Sephiroth with which h eaven and earth were sealed. These parallel the Ten Comm andments. In these Ten are included the 613 Comm andments. If you count the letters in the Ten Comm andments, you will find that there are 613 letters. They contain all 22 letters except Teth , which is mi ssing in them. What is the reason for this? This teaches us that Teth is the belly – and in n ot included among the Sephiroth. 125 . Why are they called Sephiroth ? Beca use it is written (Psalm 19:2 ) , “The heavens declare (me-Sap rim) the glory of God.” 126 . And what are they? They are three. Among them are three troops and three domi nions. The first domi nion is light. Light is the life of water. The second domi nion includes the Chaioth Ha-Qadesh , the Ophan im , the wheels of the Chariot, and all the troops of the Blessed Holy One . The bless, exalt, glorify, praise and sanctify the mi ght King with the Kedushah . Arranged in the mystery of the great Kedushah is the fearsome and terrible King . And they crown Him with t hree “holies.” 127 . Why are there three “holies” and not four? Beca use the holiness on high is three by three. It is thus written, “God is King, God was King, God will be King forever and ever.” It is also written (Numbers 6:24-26 ) , “May God bless you... May God s hine up on you... May God lift...”"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Bahir 33 It is furthermore written (Exodu s 34: 6), “God (YHVH), God (YHVH). ” The third one includes the rest of God’s Attributes. What are they? [As the verse continues], “God, merciful and gracious” – the thirteen Attributes [of Mercy]. 128 . [The Kedushah is the verse (Isaiah 6:3 ) , “Holy holy holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is filled with His Glory.”] What is the meaning of “holy holy holy”? [And why is it] foollowed by, “the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is filled with His glory”? The [first] “holy” is the highest Crown. The [second] “holy” is the root of the Tree. The [third] “holy” is attached and unified in them all. [This is followed by], “the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is filled w ith His glory.” 129 . What is the “holy” that is attach ed and u nified? What is this like? A king had sons, who in turn also had sons. When the [grand]sons do his will, he mi ngles with them, supp orts them, and satisfies them all. He gives [his sons] everything goo d, so that they should be able to satisfy their children. But when the [grand]children do not do his will, then h e only gives the fathers as much as they n eed. 130 . What is the meaning of, “the whole earth is filled with His glory”? This is the earth t hat was created on the first day. It is on high, filled with God’s glory and paralleling the Land of Israel. And what is [this glory]? It is Wisdom, as it is written (Proverbs 3:35 ), “The wise shall inherit glory.” 131 . What is “God’s glory”? What is this like? A king had a matron in his chamber, and all his troops delighted in h er. She had sons, and each day they came to see the king and to bless him. They asked h im , “W here is our mother?” He replied, “You cannot see her now.” They said, “Let her be blessed wherever she is.” 132 . What is the meaning of “from His place ”? This indicates that none know his place. This is like a royal princess who came from a f ar place . People did not know her o rigin, but they saw that she was a woman of valour, beautiful and refined in all her ways. They said, “She certainly originates from the side of light, for she illuminates the world through heer deeds.” They asked her, “From where are you?” She r eplied, “From my place.” They said, “If so, the people of your place are great. May y ou be blessed, and may y ou place b e blessed.” 133 . Is this “glory of God” then n ot one of His hosts? Is it not inferior? Why then do they bless it? But what is this like? A man h ad a beautiful garden. Outside the garden b ut close to it, he had a nice section of field. On this section, he planted a b eautiful flower garden. The first thing that he would water would be his garden. The water would spread over the entire garden. It would not reac h the section of field however, since it was not attached, even though it was all one. He therefore opened a place for it and watered it separately."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Bahir 34 134 . Rabbi Rahumai said: Glory (Kavod) and Heart (Lev) both h ave the same [numerical value, namely 32 ]. They are both one, but Glory refers to its function on high, and Heart refers to its function below. “God’s glory” and the h eart of heaven” a re therefore both identical. 135 . Rabbi Yochanan said: What is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 17:11), “And it was when Moses would raise his hands, Israel would prevail, and when h e would lower his hands, Amalek wou ld prevail.”? This teac hes us that the whole world endures beca use of the Lifting of Hands. Why? Beca use the name of the power given to Jacob is Israel. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were eac h given a particular P ower. The counterpart of the attribute in which each one walked was given to him . Abraham did deeds of kindness. He prepared food for everyone in his area and for all wayfarers. He act ed kindly and went o ut to greet them, as it is written (Genesis 18:2 ), “and he ran to greet them.” Not only that, but (Genesis 18:2) , “He bowed to the earth.” This was a complete act of kindness. God therefore granted him the same m easure and gave him the attribute of Kindness (Chesed). It is thus written (Micah 7:20) , “You give truth to Jacob, Kindness to Abraham, as You swore to o ur fathers from days of yore.” What is the meaning of “from days of yore”? This teaches us that if Abraham did not do deeds of kindness, then h e wou ld not have been worthy of the attribute of Truth. Jacob would then n ot have been worthy of the attribute of Truth. In the merit through which A braham was worthy of the attribute of Kindness, Isaac became worthy of the attribute of Terror. It is thus written (Genesis 31:53), “And Jacob swore by the Terror of his father Isaac. ” Does anyone then swear in this manner, mentioning h is belief in the Terror of his father? But up until that tim e, Jacob h ad not bee n given a ny power. He therefore swore by the power that was given to his father. It is for this reason that it is written, “And Jacob swore by the Terror of his father Isaac. ” What is it? It is Chaos. It emanates from evil and astounds people. And what is that ? It is that regarding which it is written (I Kings 18:38), “And fire came down and it consumed the burnt offering, and the stones, and the earth, and it evaporated the water that was in the trench.” It is also written (Deuterono my 4:24 ), “The Lord your God is a consumi ng fire, a jealous God.” 136 . What is Kindness? It is the Torah, as it is written (Isaiah 55:1 ), “Ho, let all who are thirsty come for water, let he without silver come, [stock up and eat – come, stock up wine and mi lk, without silver and without payment].” [Kindness is therefore] silver. It is thus written, “come, stock up and eat – come, stock up wine and milk, without silver and without payment.” He fed you Torah and taught you, for you have already earned it throug h the me rit of Abraham, who did dee ds of kindness. Without silver, he would feed others, and without payment, he would give them wine and mi lk."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Bahir 35 137 . Why wine and milk? What does one have to do with t he other? But this teac hes us that wine is Terror and mil k is Kindness. Why is wine mentioned first? Because it is closer to us. Do you then think that this refers to actual wine and mi lk? We must say that it is the Form of wine and milk. Through the merit of Abraham, who was worthy of the attribute of Kindness, Isaac was worthy of the attribute of Terror. And because Isaac was worthy of the attribute of Terror, Jacob was worthy of the attribute of Truth, which is the attribute of Peace . God bestowed him according t o his measure. It is thus written (Genesis 25:27) “Jacob was a complete man, dwelling in tents.” The word “complete” means nothing other than peace. It is thus written (Deuterono my 18:13), “You shall be complete with t he Lord your God,” and the Targum renders this, “You shall be at peace (sh’lim). ” The word “complete” refers to nothing other than the Torah. It is thus written (Malachi 2:6), “A Torah of truth was in his mouth.” Wh at is written in the v ery next phrase? It sates, “With peace and uprightness, he walked before Me.” “Uprightness” is nothing other than peace , as it is written (Psalm 25:21) , “Complete and upright.” It is therefore written (Exodu s 17:11), “And it was when Moses wou ld raise his hands, Israel would prevail. This teac hes u s that the Attribute that is called Israel has in it a “Torah of Truth.” 138 . What is the meaning of “a Torah of Truth?” It is that which teac hes (Moreh) the Truth of [all] worlds, as well as His deeds in thought. He erect ed Ten Sayings, and with them the world stands. It is one of them. In man He creat ed ten fingers, paralle ling these T en Sayings. Moses raised h is hands and concentrated to some degree on the Attribute that is called Israel , which contains the Torah of Truth. With his ten fingers, he alluded that he was upholding the Ten. For if [God] would not help Israel, then the Ten Sayings wou ld not endure every day. It was for this reason that “Israel prevailed.” [The verse continues], “And when h e lowered his hands, Amalek prevailed.” Would Mo ses then do anything that would cause Amalek to prevail? But [this teac hes u s] that it is forbidden for a person to stand for [more than] three hours with his hands spread out to heaven. 139 . His disciples asked: To whom are the hands raised? He replied: To the heights of heaven. How do we know this? It is written (Habba kkuk 3:10) , “The deep gives forth its voice, it lifts up its hands on high.” This teac hes us that the Lifting of Hands is only to the heights of the heaven. When among Israel there are p eople who are wise and kn ow the mystery of the Glorious Name, and they lift up their hands, they are imm ediately answered. It is thus written (Isaiah 58:9 ), “Then (Az) you will call and God will answer.” If you call God “then” (Az) , He will answer you immediately. 140 . What is the meaning of “then” [- Az – s pelled Aleph Zayin ]? This teac hes us that it is not permi ssible to call Aleph alone. [It can] only [be call ed] through the two letters that are attached to it, which sit first in the kingdom. Together with the Aleph, they are then three. Seven of the Ten Sayings then remain, and this"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Bahir 36 is the Zayin [which h as the numerical value of seven]. It is also written (Exodu s 15:1), “Then (Az) sang Moses and the children of Israel.” 141 . What are the Ten Sayings? The first is the Highest Crown. Blessed and praised be it name and i ts peop le. Who are its people? They are Israel. It is thus written (Psalm 100 :3) , “Know that the Lord is God, He made us, and not (Lo) we, His peop le.” [Lo is spelled Lamed Aleph and can b e read, “to Aleph”. ] The verse then reads, “to Aleph are we.” [It is our duty] to recognise and kn ow the Unity of Unities, who is unified in all His names. 142 . The second one is Wisdo m . It is thus written (Proverbs 8:22), “God procured me, the beginning of His way, before his works, from then (Az) .” A “beginning” is nothing other than Wisdom, as it is written (Psalm 111 :10), “The beginning is wisdom, the fear of God.” 143 . The third one is the quarry of the Torah, the treasury of Wisdom, the quarry of the “spirit of God”. This teac hes us that God carved out all the letters of the Torah, engraved it with spirit, and with it made all Forms. This is the meaning of the verse (1 Sam uel 2:2 ), “There is no Rock (Tzur) like our God” – there is no Former (Tzayir) like our God. 144 . These are three. What is the fourth? The fourth is (Deuterono my 33:21) , “the charity of God,” His merit and his Kindness (Chesed) to all the world. This is the Right Hand of the Blessed Holy One . 145 . What is the fifth? The fifth is the great fire of the Blessed Holy One > Regarding this it is written (Deuteronomy 18:16) , “Let me see the great fire no more, lest I die.” This is the Left Hand of the Blessed Holy One. What are they? They are the Chaioth ha -Qadesh and the holy Seraph im , to their right and their left. They are the “pleasant ones” which ascend higher and h igher, as it is written (Ecclesiastes 5:7 ), “And ones higher than they.” It is also written (Ezekiel 1:18 ), “And as for their height, they had height, and they had fear, and their height was filled with eyes, around the four.” And around Him are angels . Those around them also bow down b efore them, kneeling and declaring, “The Lord He is God, the Lord He is God.” 146 . The sixth one is the Throne of Glory, crowned, included, praised and h ailed. It is the house of the World to Come, and its place i s in Wisdo m . It is thus written (Genesis 1:3), “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” 147 . And Rabbi Yochanan said: There were two [types of] light, as it is written, “[let there b e light,] and there w as light.” Regarding both of them i t is written (Genesis 1:4) , “[And God saw the light] that it was good.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Bahir 37 The Blessed Holy One took one [of these types of light] and stored it away for the righteous in the World to Come. Regarding this it is written (Psalm 31:20), “How great is the good that You h ave hidden away for those who fear You, that You h ave acc om plished for those who find shelter in You... ” We learn that no creature could loo k at the first light. It is thus written (Genesis 1:4), “And God saw the light that it was good.” It is furthermore written (Genesis 1:21) “And God saw all that He made, and behold, it was very goo d.” God saw all that He had made and saw shining, brilliant good. He took of that good, and included in it the 32 paths of Wisdom, giving to this world. This is the me aning of the verse (Proverbs 4:2) , “I have given you a doctrine of good , My Torah, do not abandon it.” We say that this i s the treasury of the Oral Torah. The Blessed Holy One said, “This Attribute is considered to be in cluded in this world, and it is the Oral Torah. If you kee p t his Attribute in this world, then you will be worthy of the World to Come, which is the good stored away for the righteous.” What is it? It is the force of the Blessed Holy One . It is thus written (Haba kkuk 3:4 ) , “And the glow will be like light, [He has rays from His hand, and His hidden force i s there].” The glow that wa s taken from the first Light will be like [our visible] light if His children keep the “Torah and Comm andment that I w rote to teac h them.” It is thus written (Proverbs 1:8), “Hear my son, the adm onition of your father, and do not abandon the Torah of your mother.” 148 . And it is written (Haba kkuk 3:4) , “He has rays from His hand, and His hidden force is there.” What is “His hidden force” ? This is the light that was stored away and hi dd en, as it is written (Psalm 31:20), “[How great is the good] that You have hidden away for those who fear You, [that You h ave acc omplished for those who find shelter in You].” What remains for us in that which “You have acc om plished for those who find shelter in You.” These are the ones who find s helter in Your shadow in this world, who kee p Your Torah, observe Your Comm andments, and sanctify Your name, unifying it secretly and pub licly. The verse thus concludes, “in the sight of the sons of man.” 149 . Rabbi Rahumai said: This teac hes us that Israel had light. Torah is light, as it is written (Proverbs 6:23), “For a comm andment is a lamp, Torah is light, [and the way of life is the rebuke of admonition].” And we say that a lamp is a comm andment, illumination (Orah) Oral Torah, and light (Or) is the written Torah. [How can we then say that the Oral Torah is light (Or) ?] Beca use this light has already b een kept, it is called light. What is this like? A room was hidden at the end of a house. Even though it is day, and there is bright light in the world, one cannot see i n this room unless he brings along a lamp. The same is true of the Oral Torah . Even though it is a light, it needs the written Torah to answer its questions and explain its mysteries. 150 . Rabbi Rahumai said: What is the meaning of the verse (Proverbs 6:23) , “And the way o f life is the rebuke of admonition”? This teac hes us that when a person acc ustoms himself to study the Mystery of Creation and"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Bahir 38 the Mystery of the Chariot, it is im possible that he not stumble. It is therefore written (Isaiah 3:6) , “Let this stumbli ng be under your hand.” This refers to t hings that a person cannot understand unless they cause him to stumble. The Torah calls it “the rebuke of admonition,” but actually it makes one worthy of “the way of life.” One who wishes to be worthy of “the way of life” must therefore endu re “the r ebuke of admonition.” 151 . Another explanation: “Life” is the Torah, as it is written (Deuterono my 30:19), “And you shall choo se life.” It i s furthermore written (Deuterono my 30:20) , “For it is your life and your length of days.” If one wants to be worthy of it, he shou ld reject physical pleasure and acce pt the yok e of the comm andments. If he is afflicted with suffering, he shou ld acce pt it with love. He shou ld not ask, “Since I am fulfilling the will o f my Maker and am studying the Torah each day, why am I afflicted with suffering?” Rather, he shou ld acce pt it with love. Then h e will be completely worthy of the “way of life.” For who knows the ways of the Blessed Holy One? Regarding all things, one must therefore say, “Righteous are You, O G od, and Your judg ement is fair. All that is done from heaven is for the good.” 152 . You said [that the sixth one was] His Throne. Have we then n ot said that it is the Crown of the Blessed Holy One? W e have said, “Israel was crowned with three crowns, the crown of priesthoo d, the crown of royalty, and the crow n of Torah above them all.” What is this like? A king has a pleasing, beautiful vessel and he was very fo nd of it. Sometim es he placed it on his head – t his is the Tefilli n worn on the head. At other tim es he carried it on his arm – in the knot of the Tefilli n worn on the arm. Sometim es he lend it to his son so that it shou ld remain with him. Sometim es it is called His Throne. This is because He carries it as an amu let on His arm, just like a throne. 153 . What is the seventh? It is the heaven [called] Aravot . And why is it called heaven (Sha mayim)? Beca use it is round like a h ead. We learn that it is in the centre, with water at its right and fire at its left. It sup ports water (Sa Mayim) from fire and water, and brings peace between them. Fire comes and finds the attribute of fire on its side. Water comes and f ind s the attribute of water on its side. It is therefore written (Job 25:2 ) , “He makes peace in His high places.” 154 . Is it then the seventh? Is it nothing more than the sixth. But this teac hes us that the Holy Palace is here, and it suppo rts them all. It is thus counted as two. It is therefore the seventh. And what is it? It is Thought that does not hav e any end or boundary. This place likewise does not hav e any end or boundary. 155 . The seventh one is the east of the world. It is from where the S eed of Israel comes. The spinal cord originates in man’s brain and extends to the [sexual] organ, where the seed is. It is therefore written (Isaiah 43: 5), “From the east I will bring your seed, [and from the west I will gather you].”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Bahir 39 When Israel is goo d, then this is the place form which I will bring your seed, and new seed will be granted to you. But when Israel is wicked, [then I will bring] seed that has already been in the world. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 1:4) , “A generation goes and a generation comes,” teac hing us that it has already come. 156 . What is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 43:5 ) , “And from the west I will gather you”? [This means that “I will gather you”] from the attribu te that always points to the w est. Why is [west] called MaAR eV ? Because it is there that all seed is mi xed together (MitAReV) . What is this like? A king’s son h ad a bea utiful bride and h e hid her in his chamber. He took riches from his father’s house and constantly brought it to her. She in turn took everything, constantly put it away, and mixed it all together. Ultim ately he seeks to see what he had gathered and acc umulated. It is therefore written, “And from the west I will gather you.” And what is his father’s house? It is that regarding which it is written, “From the east I will bring your seed.” This teac hes u s that it is brought from the east and sowed on the w est. He then gathers what he has sowed. 157 . What is the eighth one? The Blessed Holy One has a single Righteous One (Tzadik) in His world, and it is dear to Him beca use it suppo rts all the world. It is the Foundation (Yesod). This is what sustains it, and makes it grow, increasing and watching it. It is beloved and dear on high, and beloved and dear below; fearsome and mighty on high, and fearsome and mighty below; rectified and acce pted on high, and rectified and acce pted below. It is the Foundation of all sou ls. Did you then say that it is the eighth? And do y ou say that it is the Foundation of all souls? Is it then n ot written (Exodu s 31:17), “And on the seventh day He rested and souled”? Yes, it is the seventh. This is beca use it decides between them. There are six, and three a re below and three above, and it decides between them. 158 . Why is it called the seventh? Is it then the seventh? It is not. But it is beca use the Blessed Holy One rested on the Sabbath with the attribute regarding which it is written (Exodu s 31:17), “For six days God made the heaven and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and souled.” This teac hes us that eac h day has a Saying that is its Ma ster. This is not beca use it was created on that day, but beca use that is when it does the task to which it was assigned. Each one does its task and maintains its activities. The seventh day therefore comes and does its task, making them all rejoice. Not only that, but it also causes their sou ls to grow, as it is written, “on the s eventh day He r ested and souled.” 159 . What is this “rest”? It is the absence of work. It is a ces sation which is called Shabba t (meaning rest). What is this like? A king had seven gardens, and the middle one contained a fountain, welling up from a living source. Three [of his gardens] are at its right, and three a re at its left. When it performed its function and overflowed, they all rejoiced, saying, “It overflowed for our sake.” It waters them and makes them grow, while they wait and rest. Do we then say that it waters the seven? But it is written (Isaiah 43:5 ), “From the east I will"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Bahir 40 bring your seed.” This indicates that one of [the seven] waters it. We must therefore say that it waters the Heart, and the Heart then waters them all. 160 . Rabbi Berachiah sat and expounded: Each day we speak of the World to Come. Do we then understand what we are s aying? In Aramaic, the “World to C ome” is translated “the world that cam e.” And what is the meaning of “the world that came”? We learned that before the world was created, it arose in thought to create an intense light to illumi nate it . He created an intense light over which n o creat ed thing could have authority. The Blessed Holy One saw, however, that the world cou ld not endure [this light]. He therefore took a seventh of it and left it in its place for them. Thee rest He put away for th e righteous in the Ultim ate Future. He said, “If they are worthy of this seve nth a nd k eep it, I will give them [the rest] in the Final World.” It is therefore called “the world that cam e,” since it already came [into existence] from the six days of creation. Regarding this it is written (Psalm 31:20), “How great is Your good that You h ave hidden away for those who fear You.” 161 . What is the meaning of the verse (Exodu s 15:27), “And the came to Elim , where there were twelve wells of water and seventy date palm s, and they encamped there by the water”? What is so special about seventy date p alm s? In o ne small place there can be a thousand. But [this teac hes us that] they were worthy of their counterpart. They are likened to date palm s. It is written (Exodu s 15:23) , “And they came to Marah, and they cou ld not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter (marah) .” This teac hes us that the north wind confused them. It is thus written (Exodu s 15:25), “And he cried out to God, and He showed him a tree. He cast it into the w aters, and the w aters becam e sweet.” God imm ediately place d His hand against the Satan and diminished him. It is thus written (Exodu s 15:25), “There He gave them a decree and a law, and there He proved them.” This teac hes us that at this tim e, the Satan attached him self to them in order to blot them out from the world. It is thus written (Exodu s 15:24), “And the people com plained t o Mo ses saying, ‘What shall we drink?’” [The Satan] continued to denounce Moses until he cried out to God and was answered. What is the meaning of the verse, “And He showed him a tree” ? This teach es u s that the Tree of Life was near the water. The Satan came and removed it in order to denounce Israel and cause them to sin against their Father in h eaven. [The Satan] said to them, “Are you now then going into the desert? Even n ow [you have nothing] other than bitter water, but this has some benefit, since you can make some use of it. But when you enter the desert, you will not even find [water] with which to wash your hands and face . You will die from hunger and thirst, naked and having nothing.” The people came to Mo ses and repeat ed these words, but he put t hem off. When [the Satan ] saw that he could not overcome them, he strengthene d hims elf [to o vercome] Israel and Moses. The people came, and “they complained to M oses.” They said, “Even h ere w e lack water. What will we drink in the desert?” The Satan had falsified the situation in order to cause the people to sin. As soon as M oses saw the Satan, “He cried out to God, and He showed him a tree.” This is the T ree of Life"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Bahir 41 that Satan had removed. He then “cast it into the water, and the water became sweet.” The Blessed Holy One then gave the Satan a “decree and a law,” and it was there that He “proved” Israel. The Blessed Holy One warned Israel saying (Exodu s 15:26) , “If you listen to the voice of the Lord your God, [and do what is up right in His eyes, give ear to His comm andments, and kee p all H is decr ees, then all the sickness that I brought upon the Egyptians, I will not bring up on you, for I am God who heals you].” 162 . What is this like? A king had a beautiful daughter, and others desired her. The king knew about it, but could not fight those who wanted to bring his daughter to evil ways. He came to his house and warned her, saying, “My daughter, do not pay attention to the words of these enemies and they will not be able to overcome you. Bo not leave the house, but do all your work at home. Do not sit idle, even for a single moment. Then they will not be able to see you and harm you.” They have one Attribute which causes them to leave aside every good way and choose e very evil way. When they see a p erson directing hims elf a long a good way, they hate him. What is [this Attribute]? It is the Satan. This teac hes us that the Blessed Holy One has an Attribute whose name is Evil. It is to the north of the Blessed Holy One, as it is written (Jeremiah 1:14 ), “From the north will Evil come forth, upon all the inhabitants of the earth.” Any evil that comes to all the inhabitants of the earth comes from the north. 163 . What is this One Attribute? It is the Form of a Hand. It has many messengers, and the name of them all is Evil Evil. Some of them are great, and some are small, but they all bring guilt to the world. This is because Chaos is toward the north. Chaos (Tohu ) is nothing other than Evil. It confounds (Taha ) the world and causes peop le to sin. Every Evil Urge (Yetzer HaRa) that exists in man comes from there. And why is it placed to the left? This is beca use it does not have any authority any place in the world except in the north. It is not acc ustomed to be anyw here except in the north. It does not want to be any place but in the north. If it remained the south until it learned the routes of the south, how could it lead others astray? It would have to stay there for [several] days until it learned, and then it could not cause people to sin. It therefore is always in the north, to the left . This is the meaning of the verse (Genesis 8:21), “For the Urge of man’s heart is evil fro m his youth.” It is evil from his youth, and it does not incline [in any direction] other than the left, for it is already accustomed to be there. It is regarding this that the Blessed Holy One said to Israel (Exodus 15:26), “If you listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is up right in His eyes, and give ear to His comm andments” – and not to the comm andments of the Evil Urge – “and k eep all His decrees” – and not the decrees of the Evil Urge – “[then all the sickness that I brought upon the Egyptians, I will not bring up on you,] for I am God who heals you.” 164 . What does the Evil Urge gain? What is this like? A king appointed clerks over the lands of his kingdom, over his work and over his merchandise. Each and every thing had its clerk. There was one clerk in charge of the storehouse containing goo d food. Another was in c harge of the storehouse containi ng"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Bahir 42 stones. Everyone came to the storehouse containi ng good f oo d. The c lerk in charge of the storehouse of stones came and saw that people were only buying from the other [clerk]. What did he do? He sent his messengers to tear down the weak house [so that people wou ld need stones to rebuild them]. They cou ld not do so, however, to the strong ones. He said, “In the tim e that it takes to tear down o ne strong [house], you can tear down ten weak ones. People will then all come and buy stones from me, and I will not be inferior to the other.” It is thus written (Jeremiah 1:14 ), “From the north will evil come forth, upon all the inhabitants of the earth.” The v erse then continues (Jeremiah 1:15 ) “For I call all the fami lies of the kingdom of the north – says God – and they will come, and each one will place his throne at the opening of the g ates of Jerusale m...” Evil will be their business, and the Evil Urge will also constantly strive. The word Sat an means “turning aside,” since he turns all the world aside to the balance of guilt. How is this indicated? It is written (Genesis 38:16) , “And he turned aside to her,” and the Targum renders this VeSata, [ Satah being the root of Satan]. It is likewise written (Proverbs 4:15), “Turn aside (S’the) from i t and pass on.” 165 . What is the significance of the seventy date palm s? They had accepted upon themselves the comm andments, as it is written (Exodu s 15:26), “If you listen to the voice of the Lord your God.” Imm ediately after this we find (Exodu s 15:27) “And they came to Elim (Elimah) [where there were twelve wells of water and seventy date palm s].” What is the meaning of Elimah? It is Eli Mah – “to me is what.” “W here there were twelve wells of water.” At first God gave it to them as wells, and in the end, he gave it back to them as stones. It is thus written [regarding the stones set up near the Jordan] (Joshua 4:9 ), “twelve stones.” What it the reason? It is beca use the Torah was originally likened to water in the world. Only later was it put in a permanent place. Water, however, is here one day and elsewhere the next. 166 . What are the seventy date palm s? This teac hes us that the Blessed Holy One has seventy Structures. These draw from the twelve Sim ple Ones. Just like water is simple, so are these simple. How do we know that the date palm i s a Structure? Beca use it is written (Song of Song s 7:8) , “Your structure is like a d ate p alm.” Besides that, there are s eventy kinds of date p alm s. It is therefore written that there w ere seventy date palm s. One was not like the other, their functions were all different, and the taste of one was not like the taste of the other. 167 . You said that the seventy date palm s represent the seventy Structures. But have you not said that there are 72 ? There are 71 . Israel m akes 72 , but it is not include d. But did you not say that there were seventy? One is the Officer of the Satan. What is this like? A king had sons and bought slaves for them. The king then told his sons, “I am giving you all equally.” One of them replied, “I do not want to be with you, for I have the power to steal everyt hing"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Bahir 43 from you.” The king then said, “Because of this, you will not have a portion among them at all.” [The rebellious son] did what he could. He went o ut and lay in wait for [the slaves], showing them m uch gold, jewels and troops. He said, “Come over to me.” What did the king do? He amassed his armies together with the a rmi es of all his sons. He showed them to the slaves and said, “Do not let him trick you into thinking that his armi es are stronger than mi ne. Behold the troops of that son. He is deceitful and wants to rob you . Therefore, do not listen to him, for at first he will spea k smoo thly in order to entice you into his trap, but in the end he will laugh at you. You are m y slaves, and I will do for you everything goo d if you t urn away from him and do not li sten to him.” He is the Prince of Chaos. It is thus written (1 Sam uel 12: 21), “Do not turn aside, for you will fo llow Chaos. It will not help or save, for it is Chaos.” [It cannot help or save,] but it can do harm. The advice that I give you is that you should (Exodu s 15:26), “Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, do what is right in His eyes, and give ear to His comm andments, and kee p all His decrees.” When you kee p all H is decr ees, then, “All the sickn ess that I brought upon the Egyptians, I will not bring up on you.” Why did He say all this? In order to close all doors, so that he shou ld not find you soft at tim es and hard at tim es. When you kee p all H is decr ees, then “all the sickness that I brought upon the Egyptians” – through My hand – “I will not bring upon you.” What is the meaning of “for I am God who heals you”? This means that eve n w hen h e comes and strikes, I am God who will heal you. 168 . Why do you call it the eight? Beca use with it the eight are begu n, and with i t the eight numbers are c ompleted. In function, however, it is the seventh one. And what are [the eight] that were begun ? This is the fact that a child enters the Covenant of Circumcision when eight days old. Are they then eight? They are nothing more than seven. Why then did the Blessed Holy One say eight? Because there are eight directions in man. What are they? They are as follows: The right and left hands; The right and left legs; The head, the bod y, and the Covenant as an arbitrator; And h is wife, who is his mate. It is thus written (Genesis 2:24), “And he shall cling to his wife, and they shall be one flesh.” They are the eight, and they parallel the eight days of circumcision. Are they then eight? They are nothing more that seven, since the bod y and covenant are one. It is therefore eight. 169 . What is the ninth? He said to them: the ninth and tenth are together, one opposite the other . One is higher than the other by 500 years. They are like two Wheels (Ophan im ). One inclines toward the north, while the other inclines toward the west. They reach down to the lowest earth."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Bahir 44 What is the lowest earth? It is the last of the seven earths down b elow. The end of the Divi ne Presence of the Blessed Holy One is under His feet. It is thus written (Isaiah 66:1 ) , “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is the h assock for My feet.” The Victory (Nitzachon ) of the world is there. It is thus written (Isaiah 24: 10), “for Victory of Victories (Netzach Netzachim) .” 170 . What is the meaning of “Victory of Victories”? There is a single Victory (Netzach). Which is it? It is the one that inclines toward the west. And what is secondary to it? This i s the one that inclines toward the north. And the third one? This is the one that is below. The third one? But you have said that the Chariot has two wheels. We must therefore say that the end of the Divi ne Presence is also called Victory. This is the meaning of “Victory of Victories.” “Victory” is one, and “Victories” is two, giving [a total of] three . 171 . His disciples said to him: From above to below we know. But from b elow to above we do not know. He replied: Is it not all one – below to above and above to below? They said: Our master, ascending is not the same as descending . One can r un while descending, but cannot do so while ascending. He replied: Go o ut and see. He sat and expounded to them: There is a Divine Presence below, just like there is a Divine Presence above. What is this Divine Presence? We have said that it is the light that was derived from the first Light, which is Wisdom. It also surrounds all things, as it is written (Isaiah 6:3 ), “The whole earth is filled with His glory.” What is its function? What is this like? A king had seven sons, and he assigned each o ne a place. He said to them, “Sit here, one above the other.” The lowest one said, “I will not sit at the bottom. I do not want to be far from you.” [The king] replied, “I will surround you and see you all day l ong.” This is the meaning of the verse, “The whole earth is filled with His glory.” Why is He among them? This is so that He should s upp ort them and su stain them. 172 . And what are the sons? I have already told you that the Blessed Holy One has seven Holy Forms. All o f them have a counterpart in m an, as it is written (Genesis 9:6), “for in the form of God He made man.” It is likewise written (Genesis 1:27), “In the form of God He made him, male and female He made them.” This is what they are: The right and left legs; The right and left hands; The bod y, covenant and head. But these are only six. You hav e said that there a re seven. The seventh is with his wife. It is thus written (Genesis 2:24) , “And they shall be one flesh.” But she was taken from his ribs, as it is written (Genesis 2:21), “And He took one of his"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Bahir 45 ribs.” He said: Yes from his ribs. Does he then have a rib? Yes. It is written (Exodu s 26:20), “the ribs of the tabernacle.” The Targum renders this, “the side of the tabernacle.” And what is His side? What is this like? A king had an idea to plant ten ma le trees in a g arden. All of them were date palm s. He said, “Since they are all the same kind, it is im possible for them to endure.” What did he do? He planted and Etrog among them. This was one of those which h e had intended to be male. And why is the Etrog female? Because it is written (Leviticus 23:40), “The fruit of a beautiful tree, fronds of a date palm, [branches of a tree of leaves, and willows of the broo k].” What is the fruit of a beautiful (had ar) tree? The Targum renders this verse, “The fruit of the Etrog tree, and the Lulav. ” 173 . What is the meaning of “beautiful”? It is the beauty of all things. This is also the beauty of the Song s of Song s. Regarding it, it is written (Song s of Song s 6:10) , “Who is she who loo ks forth as the dawn, fair as the moo n, clear as the sun, terrible like an army with banners?” This relates to the Female. Beca use of her, the female was taken from Adam. This is because it is impossible for the lower world to endure without the female. And why is the female called Nekev ah ? Because her orifices (Nekev ) are wide. Also because she has more orifices than the male. What are they? They are the orifices of the breasts, the womb, and the rece ptacle. 174 . And what is the reason that you said that the Song of Songs is beautiful? Yes, it is the most beautiful o f all the Holy Scriptures. Rabbi Yochanan thus said: A ll Scripture is holy, and all the Torah is holy, but the Song of Song s is the Holy of Holies. What is the meaning of the Holy o f Holies? It means that it is holy for the Holy Ones. What are the Holy Ones? They are the counterparts of the six directions that are in man. That which is holy for them is holy for everything. 175 . What is this that is Holy? It is the Etrog , which is the beauty (had ar) of them all. Why is it called beautiful (had ar) ? Do not read hada r , but HaDar – “Which dwells.” This refers to the Etrog which is not bound together with the Lulav. Without it the comm andment of the Lulav cannot be fulfilled. It is also bound with them all. It is with each one of them, and is unified with them all. 176 . What does the Lulav parallel? It is the counterpart of the spinal cord. It is thus written (Leviticus 23:40), “[fronds of a date palm,] a branch of a tree of leaves, and willows of the broo k.” The [leafy] branches [of the m yrtle] must cover the majority [of the bunch]. If its branche s do not cover its majority, it is invalid. Why?"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Bahir 46 What is this like? A man h as arms, and with them he protects his head. He has two arms, and his head makes three. [It is therefore called] “a branc h of a tree of leaves.” A “branch” is to the left, and the “leaves” are to the right. It then comes out t hat the “tree” is in the centre. And why is it called a “tree” ? Because it is the Root of the Tree. 177 . What are “willows of the broo k”? There are two [willow branches in the Lulav, ] and these parallel the two legs in man. Why are the [“willows of the broo k”] called Arvey Nachal ? Beca use the greater of the two is inclined toward the west (ma-Arev) and draws its strength from there. The one to the north is smaller than it by a journey of 500 years. It is on the northwest side, through which it functions. It is named after it, since they are both mi xed (Arav) . 178 . Another explanation: [Willows of the Brook] are call ed Arvey Nachal beca use the function of one is sometim es mixed (ma-arav) with that of the other. Why are they called Willows of the Brook ? This is because of the place in which they are fixed, which is called Brook. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 1:7) , “All the Broo ks go to the sea, but the sea is not filled.” What is this sea? W e say that it is the Etrog. How do we know that eac h of the seven Attributes is called a Brook (Nachal) ? Because it is written (Numbers 21:19), “From Gift to Nachaliel [, from Nachaliel to Bamot, and from Bamot to the valley that is in the Field of Moab, the head of the cliff, and it loo ks down on the face of the Yeshimon].” Do not read Nachaliel, but Nachley El – Brooks of God. And all six then go o n one path to the sea. What is this path? It is the one that arbitrates between them. It is thus written (Habba kuk 3:5), “Before Him goes the pestilence, and fiery bo lt at His feet.” All o f them go to that pipe, and from that pipe to the sea. This is the meaning of the verse, “From Gift to Brook s of God.” [Gift] is the place that is given, namely the brain. From there they go to the Brooks of God. “And from Brooks of God to Bamot.” What is Bamot? As the Targut renders it, Ramta – “heights.” This is the Segol that follows the Zarka . [The verse continues,] “And from Bamot to the valley that is in the Field of Moab, the head of the cliff, and it loo ks down on the face of the Yeshimon.” “And from the heights (Bamot ) to the valley that is in the Field of Moab.” This is that which is prepared. And what is that which was in the Field of Moab? Do not read Moab, but May- av –“from a f ather.” This i s the f ather regarding which it is written (Genesis 26:5) “Beca use Abraham hearkened to my vo ice, kept My trust, My co mm andments and My decrees...” What is this field? It is the one that is at “the head of the cliff,” and which also “loo ks down on the face of the Yeshimon.” [Yeshimon] is interpreted to mean Heaven. Regarding that pipe, it is written (Song of Songs 4:15) , “A fou ntain of gardens, a well o f living waters, flowing from Lebanon.” What is Lebanon? We say that this i s Wisdom . What are the Willows of the Brook (Nachal) ? W e say that this is that which gives inheritance (Nachalah) to Israel. It refers to the two Wheels of the Chariot ."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Bahir 47 179 . We learned that there are T en Spheres and Ten Sayings. Each Sphere h as its Saying . It is not surrounded by it, but rather, it surrounds it. This [physical] world is like a mustard seed inside a ring. Why? Because of the Spirit that blows up on it, throug h which it is s ustained. If this spirit were to be interrupted for even a moment, the world would be annihilated. 180 . There are three Spheres in this world. How? This world inclines to the north and the south. How? North west south. North west is the first sphere that revolves around us. Do we then say that it is to the north-west? But we say that its strength is to the north. This i s the left foot . Above it is the second Sphere, which is entirely to the west. Do we then say that it is to the west? But we say that its power is to the west. These are the Victories of the world. Above it is the third Sphere, and its power is to the south-west. What is the original power that you said was second? We say that this is the right foot . And what is the power that is to the south-west? This is the Foundation of the world. Regarding this it is written (Proverbs 10:25) , “The Righteous is the Foundation of the world.” The second power stands behind the Chariot, while the first power stands in front of it. The “Righteous, Foundation of the world” is in the centre. It emanates from the south of the world, and is officer over the other two. In its hand are also the souls of all li ving things. It is the Life of Worlds. Whenever the word “creation” (Beriah) is used, it is done with it. Regarding it, it is written (Exodu s 31:17) , “He rested and souled.” This is the attribute of the S abbath day. Regarding t his it is written (Exodu s 20:8), “Remember the Sabbath day and k eep it holy.” But it is also written (Deuteronomy 5:12), “Keep [the Sabbath].” This is spea king of the seventh attribute. Regarding this seve nth attribute it is written (Leviticus 19:30) , “My sabbaths you shall keep , and My sanctuary y ou shall fear.” What is the seventh attribute? This is the Blessed Holy One ’s attribute of Goodness. 181 . Why is it written, “My sabbaths you shall keep,” [in the plural] rather than “My sabbath” [in the singular]? What is this like? A king had a beautiful bride, and every week she would set aside a day to be with him. The king also had beautiful belo ved sons. He said to them, “Since this is the situation, you shou ld also rejoice on the day of my jo y. For it is for your sake that I strive,, and you also respect me.” 182 . What is the reason that [the Torah says] “remember” [in one place,] and “keep” [regarding the Sabbath in another]? “Remember” (zachor ) refers to the male (Zachar) . “Keep” (shamor) refers to the bride. Why is it connected to, “and My sanctuary y ou shall fear”? This is beca use My sanctuary is ho ly. Why? “Because I am God who makes you holy” – from every side. 183 . Why do we say [in the blessing after foo d], “On all that He created... [Blessed]is the Life of Worlds.” Why do we not say, “On all that You creat ed”?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Bahir 48 But we bless the Holy One, who grants His wisdom to this “Life of Worlds.” It then provides for all. 184 . What is the reason that we say [in blessings, “Blessed are you... ] who made us holy with His comm andments and comm anded us” [in the third person]? Why do we not say, “that You made us holy wit h Your comm andments, and You comm anded us, “ [in the second person]? This teac hes us that all comm andments are included in the Life of Worlds . Beca use of His love for us, He gave us [the comm andments] in order that they should make us holy and allow us to be worthy. Why? Beca use when we are in this world, we can become worthy of the World to Come, which is great. In its hand is the treasury of sou ls. When Israel is goo d, these souls are worthy of emerging and comi ng to this world. But if they are not good, the [these sou ls] do not emerge. We therefore say, “The Son of David will not come until all the sou ls in the Bod y are completed.” What is the meaning of “all the sou ls in the Bod y”? We say that this refers to all the sou ls in man’s bod y. [When these are completed] new ones will be worthy of emerging. The Son of David (the Messiah) will then come. He will be able to be born, since his soul will emerge among the other new souls. What is this like? A king had an army, and he sent them much b read t o eat. They were so lazy that they did not take care of [the bread] which they did not eat [immediately]. The bread therefore became mou ldy and went to waste. The king investigated to find out if they had what to eat, and to see i f they had eaten what h e had sent them. He found that the bread had become moul dy and they were ashamed to ask for new bread. How could they tell the king, “We did not take car e of [what you sent us,] bu t now we a re asking for more”? The king also became angry. He took the mou ldy b read and ordered that it be dried and rectified as much as possible. He swore to the men, “I will not give you any more bread until you eat all this mou ldy b read.” He then returned the bread to them. What did they do? They agreed to divide it up, and each one took his portion. The diligent one took his portion and place d it in the air, taking care of it and keeping it in goo d con dition to eat. The other one took it and ate it lustfully. He ate what he could a nd laid the rest aside, not taking care of it since he had given up on it. It spoiled even more and became so m ouldy that he could not eat it a t all. He therefore starved t o death. He was then blamed for the sin of his bod y: Why did you kill yourself? Is it not enough that you ruined the bread the first tim e? But I returned it to y ou and you r uined it [again]. You ruined your portion b ecause you were too lazy to take car e of it. And n ot only that, but you also killed yourself.” [The solder] replied, “My lord, what could I have done?” He answered, “You should have taken car e of it. And if you claim that you were not able to, you shou ld have watched your friends and neighbours with w hom you shared the bread. You shou ld have seen what they did and how they took car e of it, and you should have kept it like they did.” They also interrogated him : Why did you kill yourself? Is it not enough that you ruined the bread? But you also went ahead and killed the matter of your bod y. You shortened the days of your life, or [at least] caused it. It may h ave been possible that you would have had a good son. He could have saved you, and [rectified] the damage that you and others did. Your"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Bahir 49 suffering will therefore be increased on all sides. He became confused and replied, “Wh at could I have done when I did not have any b read? With what could I have sustained myself?” They answered: If you would have strived and worked in Torah, you would not reply foolishly and brazenly like this. Beca use of your reply, it is obvious that you have not worked or strived in Torah. It is thus written (Deuterono my 8:3) , “For not by bread alon does man live, but form all that emanates from God’s mouth does man live.” You shou ld have searched and probed and asked, “what is it through which m an lives?” What is this which “emanates from God’s mouth” From here they said, “An ignoramus cannot be pious.” If a person does not act with kindness (Chesed) toward him self, he cannot be c alled p ious (Chasid) . 185 . How can one do kindness to his Ma ster? By studying the Torah. All study of Torah is a deed of kindness toward one’s Ma ster. It is thus written (Deuterono my 33:26) , “He rides the heavens with your help, [His pride is in the skies].” God says, “W hen you study Torah for its own sake, then you help Me and I can ride the heavens.” Then, “His pride is in the skies (Shechakim). ” What is Shechakim ? W e say that it is in the innermost chamber. The Targum thus renders it, “His word is in the Heaven of Heaven.” Therefore, “not by bread alone does man live, but from all that emanates from God’s mouth does man live.” However, “the foo l answers brazenly.” “Abandon this brazenness, and do not reply i n this manner! ” He is therefore pun ished. What is his pun ishment? We have already discussed it. 186 . What is the meaning of the verse (Job 15:2 ), “Shou ld a wise man answer knowledge of spirit?” W hat is “knowledge of spirit”? This is the Knowledge that is close to the spirit. Regarding this it is written (Isaiah 11:2 ) , “And there will rest upon him a spirit of God, a spirit of wisdom and understanding, [a spirit of counsel and strength, a spirit of knowledge and the f ear of God].” [First comes] Wisdom, and then comes Understanding . And in Understanding is “counsel, strength, knowledge and the fear of God.” But you told us that “counsel” is dee ds of Kindness, and that Understanding is the Attribute of Justice. [One is above the other.] Knowledge is Truth. Knowledge is therefore that with which one recognises the truth. “The fear of God” is the Treasury of the Tora h . This is like I say, but one is above the other . Rabbi Akiba thus said: With w hatever God created, He c reated its counterpart. It is thus written (Ecclesiates 7:14) , “Also one opposite the other has God made.” What is the Treasury of the Torah? It is that regarding which it is written (Isaiah 33: 6), “The fear of God is His treasury.” A person must first be god-fearing, and then h e can study Torah. This is like a p erson w ho c omes to buy date honey but does not bring a v essel in which to carry it. He says, “I will carry it in my b osom.” He tries to carry it in his bosom but it was"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Bahir 50 very heavy, and he is also afraid that it will tear and soil h is clothing. He therefore throws it away on the road. This person is then punished twice. First beca use he ruined good food, and second beca use he wasted his m oney. 187 . The fear of God is the one that is higher. It is in the palm o f God’s hand. It is also His Force. This palm (kaf) is called the pan of merit (Kaf Zechut). This is because it inclines the world to the pan of merit. It is thus written (Isaiah 11:3 ), “I will grant him a spirit of the fear of God, and he will not judg e by the sight of his eyes, he will not admonish acc ording to what his ear hears.” He will incline all the world to the pan of merit. From there counsel em anates, and from there health emanates to the world. [It is also written,] (Genesis 49:24) “From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel.” This i s the place that is called “There.” Regarding this, it is written (Haba kkuk 3:4), “[He has rays from His hand,] and His hidden Force is there. ” 188 . Once this thing comes, sharpen it. What is its sharpening? Tell us the meaning of the verse, “He has rays from His hand.” Why does it first say “rays” and they “His hand”? It should have said “His hands” [in the plural]. There is no contradiction. This is very much like the verse (Exodu s 32 :19) , “And Moses’ anger flared, and he threw the tablets from his hands.” The way this is written, however, it would be r ead “His hand” [in the sing ular]. It is likewise written (Exodu s 17:12), “And his hands was faithful until the sun set.” The verse says Emunah (“was faithful” – in the singular) and not Emuno t (“were faithful” – in the plural. They replied: Our master, we are pointing out a contradiction in order to receive an answer, and you are covering o ur eyes. Did you not teac h us, master, that you m ust answer first things first and last things last? [He said:] And what have you then asked? [The meaning of,] “He has rays from His hand.” By the Divine service, I have just explained it to you with my words. They were ashamed. When h e saw that they were ashamed is it not true that [at first] there w as water, and that fire emanated form i t ? Wa ter therefore included fire. And Master, what is the meaning of “rays”? He replied: There are five rays. These a re the five fing ers on man’s right hand. 189 . And master, you are the one who told us in Rabbi Yochanan’s name that there are only tow arms of the world.” He replied: Yes. But here “rays” allude to the two rays that are below them. And what are they? He said: With the anger of your head. And what is above? He said: The fear of God. 190 . And what is the fear of God?"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Bahir 51 It is the first light. Rabbi [Meir] thus said: Why is it written (Genesis 1:3) , “And God said, ‘let there be light,’ and there was light”? Why does it not say, “and it was so”? But this teac hes us that the light was very intense, so that no created thing could gaze up on it. God therefore stored it away for the righteous in the Ultim ate Future. This is the measure of all merchandise (Secorah) in the world. It is also the power of the precious stones that are called Socheret and Dar . And up on w hat is the attribute of Dar? This teac hes us that God took a thousandth of its radiance, and from i t He constructed a beautiful preciou s stone. In it He included all the comm andments. Abraham came, and He sought a power to give him . He gave him this precious stone, but he did not want it. He was worthy and took Kindness as his attribute, as it is written (Micah 7:20) , “Kindness to Abraham.” Isaac came, and He sought a power, bu t He g ave it to him and he did not want it. He was worthy and took the attribute of Strength, which is [called] Terror. It is thus written (Genesis 31:53) , “And Jacob swore by the Terror of Isaac his father.” Jacob came and wanted it, bu t it was not given to him. They said, “Since Abraham i s above and Isaac is below him, you will be in the centre and t ake all three.” What is the centre? It is peace, as it is written (Micah 7:20 ) , “You give Truth to Jacob.” Truth is identical w ith Peace , as it is written (Esther 9:30) , “W ords of Peace and Truth.” It is likewise written (2 Kings 20:19 ) , “For peace and truth will be in my days.” This is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 58:14 ), “I will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father.” This is a com plete inheritance (Nachalah) , comprising Kindn ess, Terror, Truth and Peace . It is therefore written (Psalm 118 :22) , “The stone despised by the builders has become the chief cornerstone.” This is the Stone that was despised by A braham and Isaac, the builders of the world, and that then b ecame the chief cornerstone. 191 . And why did they despise it? Is it not written (Genesis 26:5), “Beca use Abraham hearkened to My vo ice, and kept My watch, My commandments, My decr ees, and My Torahs.” What is the meaning of “My watch”? It refers to what the Attribute of Kindness said: As long as Abraham was in the world, I did not have to do my job. Abraham stood there in my place and “kept my watch.” It is my tas k to bring merit to the world, and even when people are guilty, I bring them merit. I also bring them back, directing their hearts to do the will of their Father in h eaven. All this Abraham did, as it is written (Genesis 21:33) , “And he planted a tam arisk in Beersheba, and he called there in the name of the Lord, God of the world.” He would share his bread and water with all the peop le in the world, bringing them merit. Seeking to convince them, he wou ld say, “W hom then are you serving? Serve the Lord, God of heaven and earth.” He would preac h to them until they would repent. How do we know that he would also bring merit to those who were guilty? It is written (Genesis 18:17), “Shall I then cover from Abraham what I am do ing? Abraham is becomi ng a great, mi ghty nat ion, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him.” [God said,] “I will give him m erit. I know that he will seek mercy for them and be worthy.”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Bahir 52 Is it then possible to say that the Blessed Holy O ne did not know that they cou ld be saved? But He told this [to Abraham] to bring h im merit. From here they said, “If one comes to purify him self, they help h im. If one comes to defile himself, they open for him.” What is the meaning of, “they open for him ”? It refers to those that are always open. 192 . [It is written that Abraham kept] (Genesis 26:5) , “My comm andments, My decrees, and My Torahs.” He said, “Since I do not want [the precious stone], I will keep all the comm andments that are included in it. ” What is the meaning of “My Torahs”? This teaches us that he knew and kept eve n the decisions (Horah) and discussions that are taught on high. 193 . And what is the meaning of the verse (Genesis 49:24) , “From there is the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.” From “There” is nourished the Rock of Israel. What is the meaning of “from There”? We say that this i s the Supernal Righteous One (Tzadik). What is it? It is [the precious stone called] Socheret. And the stone that is below it is called Dar . And what are the rays mentioned in the verse (Habakkuk 3:4), “He has rays from His hand”? These are the five fingers of the right hand."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Bahir 53 Section V Mysteries of the Soul 194 . Rabbi Rahumai said: This I received [from the tradition]. When Mo ses wanted to know about t he glorious fearsome Name, may it be blessed, he said (Exodu s 33:18 ) , “Show my please Your glory.” He wanted to know why there are righ teous who have good, righteous who have evil, wicked who have good, and wicked who have evil. But they would not tell him. Do you then think that they did not tell him? Can one then imagine that Moses did not know this mystery? But this is what Moses said: “I know the ways of the Powers, but I do n ot know how Thought spreads through them. I know that Truth is in Thought, but I do not know its parts.” He wanted to know, but they wou ld not tell him. 195 . Why is there a righteous person w ho has good, and [another] righteous person who has evil? This is because the [second] righteous person was wicked previou sly, and is now being pun ished. Is one then punished for his childhoo d dee ds? Did not Rabbi Simon say that in the Tribunal on high, no pun ishment is meted out until one is twenty years or older. He said: I am not speaking of his present lifetim e. I am speaking about what he has already been, previou sly. His colleagues said to him: Ho w long will you conceal your words? He replied: Go o ut and see. What is this like? A person planted a vineyard and hoped to grow grapes, but instead, sour grapes grew. He saw that his planting and harvest were not succe ssful so he tore it out. He cleaned o ut the sour grape vines and planted a gain. When he saw that his planting was not succe ssful, he tore it up and planted it again. How many t im es? He said to them: For a thousand gen erations. It is thus written (Psalm 105:8 ), “The word that He comm anded for a thousand generations.” It is in relation to this that they said, “Lacking were 974 generations. The Blessed Holy O ne stood up a nd planted them in each generation.” 196 . Rabbah said: If the righteous wanted, they cou ld create a world. Wh at interferes? Your sins, as it is written (Isaiah 59:2 ) , “Only y our sins separate b etween you and your God.” Therefore, if not for your sins, there would not be any differentiation b etween you and Him . We thus see that Rabba creat ed a man a nd sent it to Rav Zeira. He spoke to it, but it woul d not reply. But if not for your sins, it would also have been able to reply. And from what would it have replied? From i ts soul. Does a man then h ave a soul to place in i t? Yes, as it is written (Genesis 2:7 ), “And He blew in his nostrils a sou l of life.” If not for your sins, man would therefore have a “sou l of life.” [ Becau se of your sins, however] the soul is not pure. This is the difference between you and Him. It is thus written (Psalm 8:6), “And You have"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Bahir 54 made him a little less than God.” What is the meaning of “a little”? This is beca use [man] sins, while the Blessed Holy One does not. Blessed be He and blessed be His Name for ever and ever, He h as no sins. But the [Evil] Urge comes from Him. Can we then im agine that it comes from Him? But it originated from Him unt il David came and killed it. It is thus written (Psalm 109 :22) , “My h eart is hollow within me.” David said: Beca use I was able to overcome it (Psalm 5:5), “Evil will not sojourn with You.” How was David a ble to o vercome it? Through his study, since he never stopped [study ing ] day or night. He therefore attached the Torah on high. For whenever a person studies Torah for its own sake, the Torah attaches itself to the Blessed Holy One. They therefore say, “A person shou ld always study Torah, even n ot for its sake, since if [he studies it] not for its sake, he will eve ntually come to [study it] for its sake.” What is this Torah that you are discussing? It is the Bride who is adorned and crowned, and who is included in the comm andments. It is the Treasury of the Torah. It is the betrothed of the Blessed Holy One, as it is written (Deuteronomy 33:4 ), “Moses comm anded us the Torah, the h eritage (Morasha) of the congregation of Jacob.” Do not read “heritage” (Morasha) but “betrothed” (Me’urasa). How is his so. When Israel engages in the Torah for its own sake, then it is the betrothed of the Blessed Holy One, then it is the heritage of Israel. 197 . Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: Why was Tamar worthy o f being the mother of Peretz and Zerach? It was beca use her name was Tamar. Tamar was [also] the sister of Amnon. She was therefore made for this. Why were they called Peretz and Zerach? Peretz was named after the moo n. The moo n b reaks out (paratz) at tim es, and will be built up in the future. Zerach was named after the sun, which always shines (zarach) in the same manner. But Peretz was the first-born. Is then the sun n ot greater than the moo n? This is no difficulty, as it is written (Genesis 38:28), “One put out a hand,” [indicating that Zerach’s hand emerged before Peretz was born]. It is then written (Genesis 38:30) , “This his brother, upon whose hand was the scarlet thread, emerged, and he was named Zerach.” [Zerach] was supp osed to have b een the first-born. But God saw that Solom on wou ld descend [from Peretz], and He had such great joy that He made [Zerach] return. 198 . Why was she called Tamar and not any other name? Beca use she was female. Can we then say that [it was something special that] she w as femal e? But it is beca use she included both male and female. For [Tamar means a date palm , and] every date palm i ncludes both male and female. How is this? The frond (Lulav) is male. The fruit is male on the outside and female on the inside. And how? The seed of the date has a split like a woman. Parall eling it is the power of the moo n above. The Blessed Holy One creat ed A dam ma le and fema le, as it is written (Genesis 1:27), “Male and female He creat ed them.” Is it then possible to say this? Is it then n ot written (Genesis"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Bahir 55 1:27), “And God created man in His im age, in the image of God He created him ”? It is only then later written (Genesis 2:18), “I will make him a helper opposite him ,” and (Genesis 2:21), “And He took one of his ribs, and closed the flesh under it.” [We therefore see that the m ale was created first, and only later the female. ] But we must say that the Torah uses [three different words]: “formed” (yatzar), “made” (asah) , and “created” (bara). When the sou l was made, the word “made” is used. [The word “created” is then used: ] “Male and female He created them.” The word “formed” was used when the sou l was combined with the bod y and the spirit was brought together. How do we know that “formi ng” means bringing together? For it is written (Genesis 2:19) , “And the Lord God formed (gathered) all the beasts of the field and all the flying things of the heaven, and He brought them to the Man to see what he would call each thing.” This explains the verse (Genesis 5:2), “Male and fema le H e c reated them.” It is a lso written (Genesis 1:28) , “And God blessed them.” 199 . The soul of the female comes from the Fema le, and the soul of the male comes from the Male. This is the reason why the Serpent followed Eve. He said, “Her soul co mes from the north, and I will therefore quickly seduce her.” And how did he seduce her? He had intercourse with h er. 200 . His disciples asked: Tell us how this took place. He replied: The wicked Samael made a bond with all the host on high against his M aster. This was beca use the Blessed Holy One said [regarding man] (Genesis 1:26) , “And let him rule over the fish of the sea and the flying things of heaven.” [Samael] said, “How can we cause him to sin a nd be exil ed from before God?” He descended with all his host, and sought a suitable companion o n earth. He finally found the serpent, which loo ked like a camel, and he rod e on it. He then went to the woman and said to her (Genesis 3:1), “Did God also say, from all the trees of the garden [you shall not eat]?” [He said, “I know that He did not forbid all the trees,] but I will seek more – I will add in order that she shou ld subtract.” She replied, “He did not stop us from anything besides” (Genesis 3:2) “the fruit of the tree that is in the mi ddle of the garden. God said, ‘Do not eat from i t and do not touch it, lest you die.’” She adde d two things. She said, “from the fruit of the tree that is in the mi ddle of the garden,” while [God] had only said (Genesis 2:17) , “from the Tree of Knowledge.” She also said, “do not touch it lest you die,” [while God had only spoken of eating it]. What did Samael do? He went and touched the tree. The tree cried out and said, “Wicked one, do not touch me!” It is thus written (Psalm 36:12) , “Let not a foot of pride overtake me , and let not the hand of the wicked move me. There have the workers of iniquity fallen – they are thrust down, they cannot rise.” He then said to the woman, “See, I touched the tree and I did not die. You can also t ouch it and not die.” The woman went and touched the tree. She saw the Angel o f Death approaching her and said, “Woe is to me. Now I will die and the Blessed Holy On e will make another woman a nd give her to Adam. I will therefore cause him to eat with me. If we die, we will both die, and if we live, we will both live.” She took the fruit of the tree and ate it, and s he also gave some to her husband. Their eyes"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Bahir 56 opened and their teeth were set on edge. He said, “What is this that you have given me to eat? Just as my teeth were set on edge, so will the teeth of all [future] generations be set on edge.” [God then] sat down in true judg ement, as it is written (Psalm 9:5), “[You have upheld my cause, You have sat on the throne as a] righteous Judg e.” He called t o Adam and s aid “Why do you flee from Me?” [Adam] replied (Genesis 3:10) , “ ‘I heard Your voice in the garden’ – and my b ones trembled. ‘I was afraid beca use I was naked, and I hid.’ I was naked of works, I was naked of comm andments, and I was naked of deeds.” It is therefore written “beca use I was naked, and I hid.” What was Adam’s garment? It was a skin of fingernail. As soon as he a te from the fruit of the tree, this skin of fingernail was removed from him, and he s aw him self naked. It is thus written (Genesis 3:11), “Who told you that you were naked? [Did you eat from the tree that I comm anded you not to eat from i t?]” Adam said to the Blessed Holy One, “Master of all worlds: When I was alone, did I ever sin before You? But the woman that You place d with me enticed me from your word.” It is thus written (Gensis 3:12) , “The woman that you place d with me [gave it to me, and I ate].” The Blessed Holy One said to her, “Is it not enough that you sinned? But you also caused Adam to sin.” She replied to Him , “Master of all worlds: The serpent enticed me to sin before You.” [God] took the three of them, and decr eed upon them a sentence of nine curses and dea th. He then cast the wicked Samael and his group from their holy place in h eave n. He cut o f the feet of the serpent and cursed it more than all the other anim als and beasts of the field. He also decreed that it must shed its skin e very seven y ears. Samael was punished and made the guardian angel over the wicked Esau. In the Future, when God uproo ts the Kingd om of Edom, he will lower him first. It is thus written (Isaiah 24:21 ), “God will punish the host of heights of high.” This statement, death and punishment all came b eca use she a dded to the command ment of the Blessed Holy One. Regarding this it is said, “W hoever increase dim inishes.” May God enlighten ou r eye s with t he light o f H is Torah , May He place in our hearts His fear, May we be worthy to greet Hi m.
