Butler, etc., and become frustrated by all the reference to the Kabbalah (or Qabalah), of which they often know nothing. And, the \"usual sources\" often are a s confusing and complex as the original references. Everyone has t heir theory, and no one seems willing to simply get people started. Following is a basic tree diagram, with planetary c orrespondences, and a quick discussion of pillars, a few theories, et al. It is intended to provide the novice student some basic building bloc ks, not be the \"be all and end all\" of the Kabbalah, or its correct ap plication in magickal practice. I have conspicuously chosen to avoid any discussion of paths and their numbers, considering that an advanced and often unnecessary topic for those who have not delved too deep. In the interest of making my life easy, I have turn ed the usual circles for the Sephiroth into squares. Ascii art is easie r that way. In the Tree-of-Life, there are ten Sephiroth. Thes e can be seen as corresponding to the known planets and the Sun. In various magickal systems, a common goal is the attainment of underst anding such as results from successful traveling the tree from Mal kuth, or Earth, to Kether, the attainment. In this presentation, I wi ll associate Kether with Pluto, Chokmah with Uranus, and Neptune with D a'ath, the \"invisible Sepiroth.\" I realize this is at odds with many sys tems and presentations, which often give no planetary correspondences whats oever for these Sephiroth. However, it seems logical that these \" recently discovered\" planets should be assigned, and when this is done, these are the usual choices. These attributions can be especially mea ningful and helpful to a new \"magickal\" student with a background in and u nderstanding of astrology and/or planetary attributions.

Lots of interesting Hebrew names of the Sephiroth, with their various meanings and attribut ions according to which author you are reading, and according to the classic Jewish scholars on the Kabbalah. Their \"most common\" plan etary attributions, which with a good book on astrology or a good book on magickal attributions of planets are one means of shedding l ight on the \"nature\" of these Sephiroth. They also get numbers. There are 22 \"paths,\" or means of connecting the Se phiroth, which will not be discussed here. I have drawn them in for cl arity, but I have not appropriately numbered them. There are also three \"veils of negative existence\" beyond Kether. I will not discuss them. Someone else will. Some Ways of Viewing the Information According to certain means of addressing the Tree, the Sephiroth can be further subdivided into groups. One manner of doin g this is to label each \"column,\" as shown here, the left-hand \"Pillar of Severity,\" the right-hand \"Pillar of Mercy\" and the Middle Pillar, also known as the \"Pillar of Mildness\" or the \"Pillar of Equilibrium. \" In perusing my library of works by magickal authors, the most comm on opinion about these pillars seems to be that one should proceed u p the tree focused on the Middle Pillar. I would not recommend the be ginning student concern themselves much with these or other labels, merely understand that they are there and so labeled. Various author s will present their own opinions as to what these labels mean and the i mportance thereof. Another manner of subdividing the Sephiroth is to g roup them into triangles. Da'ath and Malkuth are basically \"left out\" of these groupings. One grouping is Kether, Chokmah and Bin ah, sometimes called the \"supernal\" triangle. A second is Chesed, Gebur ah and Tiphareth, with labels too numerous to mention. The final tri angle consists of Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Still yet another way of viewing the tree is the \"p ath of the serpent\" and the \"path of the sword,\" which visually appears like many magickal symbols, as well as resembling a caduceus somewhat. In this construction, the \"path of the serpent\" follows the numbers given in order, with the \"head\" of the serpent in Kether and the \"tail\" of the serpent in Malkuth. This manner of addressing the three noticably \"touches\" all the Sephiroth. To visualize the swor d, overlay it on the Middle Pillar, with the hilt in Kether and the poin t in Malkuth. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Some people will tell you you need to \"back into\" t he tree. Some people will talk about \"Qlippoth,\" or \"negative shadows\" o f the Sephiroth. Some people will tell you that Kether is in Malkuth (i.e., they connect back together). These can all be very interesting or very boring ways to look at things, depending on the author and your interests. The Importance of Tiphareth and That Annoying Invis ible Sephira Tiphareth, or \"the Sun\" is associated in many magic kal systems, including Aleister Crowley's with what he called \"k nowledge and conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel\" or unders tanding of one's True Will. He even wrote a ritual specifically gea red to attain this state, or what could be seen as \"progress\" to this point in the Tree. I can attest from personal experience that this is a rather heady experience, to be fully \"in the glory of Tiphareth. \" In a Middle Pillar approach, the obvious \"next step\" is crossing the \" abyss\", or passing through (or around, or over, etc., etc.) Da'ath. P hrases such as \"dweller on the threshold,\" names such as \"Choronzo n\" or the \"demon of the Abyss\" are tossed about. Doesn't sound like fu n? It's not supposed to. A psychological approach might say that this is the part of yourself you deny: the things you don't like about yourself. I n a departure from my \"info only\" approach I will offer this \"way of look ing at it\" that I think gets passed over and/or shrouded in mystery by thos e who martially enter the Abyss to \"defeat\" the demon. In an old Star Trek episode (oh no, she's using tel evision shows!), Captain Kirk is split by the transporter into two b eings, one \"evil\" and strong, and the other \"good\" and weak. Now, I don' t believe in evil and good, per se, but the analogy is useful. The \"weak \" side had all the intellect, control and compassion we associate with \"nice\" behavior, while the \"strong\" side had all the power, passion and forcefulness we associate with \"emotional\" and \"not so nice\" behavi or. Problem was, the \"weak\" Kirk couldn't even make a decision by himsel f, he couldn't commit to a choice, and the \"strong\" Kirk couldn't control his behavior or understand the needs of another human being. He wa s divided against himself. In the resolution, they are sent through the transporter again, and the \"weak\" Kirk reassures and embraces t he \"strong\" Kirk so they can be together again, and he can be whole aga in and \"able to command.\" Why does this seem so important to me? It often se ems we are \"divided against ourselves\" in this society, calling parts o f ourselves \"bad\" and others \"good,\" judging ourselves and others very ha rshly, perhaps disabling ourselves by denying ourselves all our ab ilities. I don't think we all divide like Captain Kirk, but I sugges t that the \"demon of the abyss\" is this \"shadow self\" we have judged and thrown away, rather than choosing to embrace and also control. However we visualize the process, I would like to offer that a useful way mi ght be to see ourselves embracing the demon and unifying it with the angel, to become more whole. I have found it very useful for me, at any rate, and offer it to others as an idea I think has merit and may b e helpful for the beginning student in magick, once he or she progres ses a little further on the path. In Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Many writers will toss the Kabbalah, several perspe ctives on Astrology, the Tarot, 6 or 7 systems of magick, Yoga, numerolo gy, etc. at you. Some of it will stick. I hope this little treatise provides some \"glue\" for the Kabbalah information. In my estimation, th ey all relate back to each other, and the importance of them all is under standing of self. In other words, take a step back once in a while, don' t get too mesmerized by all the details. The \"goal\" is to become more a ware of the \"real world,\" and more effective in your chosen path in t he universe, and hopefully a more wonderful human being, in touch wi th your starry nature and the starry nature of the other beings on the planet. Magick should help in this task. The ways of viewing the tree, the symbols you might associate with a particular thing, tools you choose and the rituals you perform should be focused on what they teach you, and how they help you become what you want to be, or your \" best true self,\" they are not an end in and of themselves. ***Every man and every woman is a star.*** ~References: 1) _Magick in Theory and Practice_, by Aleister Cro wley.
