The spelling varies: In this paper, Kabbalah , for the most part, refers to Jewish doctrine; Cabala refers to Christian developments. Cabala figures into many tenets and methods central to Western esoteric thought and practice. Unfortunately, what is meant by term is not always clear and may vary from one reference to another. Those readers who enter an investigation of (Christian) Cabala after having studied (Jewish) Kabbalah may well become impatient at the outset with the misreadings and deformations characteristic of “Christian developments.” Perhaps even more frustrating, after co- opting such Kabbalah as was desired, virtually all Christian Cabalists sought to transform it into a dogmatic weapon to turn back against the Jews to compel their conversion—starting with Ramon Llull (ca. 1232-1316). See Harvey J. Hames, The Art of Conversion: Christianity and Kabbalah in the Thirteenth Century (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2000), a study of Llull “as being the first Christian to acknowledge and appreciate Kabbalah as a tool of conversion.” Hames demonstrates, too, that Llull was “not a Kabbalist, nor was he versed in any particular Kabbalistic approach” (p. 27). Refer, in particular, to Hames’ Chapter Three: “Into the Gates of Wisdom.” (Further on Llull, see “Items of Interest”: Herrera, Llull, Man, Myth & Magic , and Rossi.) The strand of Cabala which has become best known began in Renaissance Florence with Giovanni Pico della Mirandola ( 1463-94). Pico and his camp sought to harmonize their Christian beliefs with Kabbalah, which they considered a primal form of Jewish doctrine which originated with Moses himself (if not Adam) and thus long presaged the teachings of Jesus. This parallels the treatment of the Hermetica by the circle around Ficino, namely the movement to recover the prisca theologia , the ancient theology, thought to be the fountainhead of religion and philosophy. (See D.P. Walker, The Ancient Theology [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972—described in “Items of Interest”] and Jerome Friedman, The Most Ancient Testimony: Sixteenth-Century Christian-Hebraica in the Age of Renaissance Nostalgia [Athens: Ohio University Press, 1983].) © Don Karr 1995-2004.

There is not a whole lot on these early Spanish Cabalists, e.g., Abner of Burgos and Pablo de Heredia, in the English literature available. The promising title, Spanish Christian Cabala by Catherine Swielicki (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1986), worthy as it is, deals with later manifestations of Christian Cabala in Spain. While Swietlicki’s book might not generally be thought of as a primer on Cabala, it does contain a good overview of the Renaissance period as its opening chapter, which could help those approaching this subject for the first time to get their bearings. Swietlicki goes on to summarize “The Diffusion of the Christian Cabala in Renaissance Culture” in Chapter 2, giving a country-by-country account, covering Italy, France, England, and Spain. She then details the Cabala of Santa Teresa de Jesus (of Avila), Fray Luis de Leon, and San Juan de la Cruz—all of the sixteenth century.* On Abner and Pablo (as well as Pico and his contemporary Abraham Farissol), see Gershom Scholem, “The Beginnings of the Christian Kabbalah,” in The Christian Kabbalah: Jewish Mystical Books and Their Christian Interpreters , edited by Joseph Dan (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1997). This article was originally published in German: “Zur Geschichte der Anfange der Christlichen Kabbala” in Essays Presented to Leo Baeck (London: 1954); then in French: “Considerations sur l’Histoire des debuts de la Kabbale chretienne” in Kabbalistes Chretiens (Paris: Albin Michel, 1979). See also “Items of Interest”: Sirat and Graetz. Ideally, we would find sources which led us in a nice straight line from the Renaissance to the present day. Alas, the materials available on the subject and the history of Cabala itself conspire to make our effort one fraught with cuts and detours, though a certain shape to it all does emerge. At the outset, the limitations of an English-only bibliography should be noted, for any short list of the literature on Christian Cabala consists largely of works in other languages. Among the standard works are • Benz, Ernst. Die christliche Kabbala: Ein Stiefkind der Theologie (Zurich: Rhein-Verlag, 1958) • Faivre, Antoine (ed).

Blau’s Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance (New York: Columbia University Press, 1944; rpt. Port Washington: Kennikat Press, 1965; rpt Brampton: Ballantrae Reprints, 1998). Subsequent writers on the subject, while often disagreeing with Blau on key points, have freely used such words as “groundbreaking,” “essential,” and “pioneer” when referring to his study. To provide a brief outline of Christian Cabala, the contents of Blau’s work are described here: The first chapter summarizes the history of the Kabbalah within Judaism, following Gershom Scholem. The second chapter takes up the beginnings of Christian interest in the Kabbalah, stating that Ramon Llull “did not write of the Cabala in the thirteenth century” and that the pseudo-Llullian De auditu kabbalistico is somewhat Kabbalah-like, but not kabbalistic. Blau then considers Pico in some detail. The third chapter discusses those whom Pico influenced, directly or from a distance. The fourth chapter focuses on Pico’s most important follower, Johannes Reuchlin. Chapter Five summarizes Paolo Ricci’s De coelesti agricultura and from it offers a translation of “Introduction to the Lore of the Cabalists or Allegorizers.” This fifth chapter finishes with a survey of others who “followed the path of cabalism to Christianity.” The sixth chapter, “The Fantastic Cabala,” discusses how Cabala became entangled with magic, referring to, among others, Agrippa and Paracelsus. Chapter Seven treats Jean Thenaud* and his work, The Holy and Very Christian Cabala (Appendix D of Blau’s book contains selections from this work in the original French). The continued diffusion of “the Christian interpretation of the cabala” is discussed in Chapter Eight, “The Erudites.” Chapter Nine offers Blau’s conclusions, namely that Cabala was treated and shaped in many ways for many different purposes by many Christian interpreters, none of whom knew very much about Kabbalah . Several appendices follow: A, on Moses Cordovero; B, on whether Ramon Llull was a cabalist; C, on the identity of Archangelus of Burgo Nuovo; and D, selections from Thenaud. An impressive bibliography lists Jewish and Christian primary and secondary sources. __________ * In his article, “Renaissance Kabbalah” (in Modern Esoteric Spirituality , edited by Antoine Faivre and Jacob Needleman, New York: Crossroad Publishing, 1995), G. Mallary Masters singles out Jean Thenaud’s Traite de la Cabale chretienne as “one very typical ‘popularizing’ treatise from early sixteenth-century France.” After summarizing its contents, Masters reviews its sources, which amounts to a survey of the key figures of Renaissance Cabala: Pico, Reuchlin, Agrippa, Ricci, and Giorgi. As an overview, this article is awfully rapid. Better introductory articles and chapters for our purposes are • Antoine Faivre’s “Renaissance Hermeticism and the Concept of Western Esotericism” in Gnosis and Hermeticism , edited by Roelof van den Broek and Wouter J. Hanegraaff (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998); • Wouter J. Hanegraaff’s historical outline of “traditional esotericism” (Chapter 14, especially section C, “The Components of Western Esotericism”) in New Age Religion and Western Culture (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996) • Marsha Keith Schuchard, “The Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance, and the Develop- ment of the Syncretic Occult Tradition,” = CHAPTER II of Freemasonry, Secret Societies, and the Continuity of the Occult Traditions in English Literature (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Texas at Austin, 1975). • Catherine Swietlicki, “Christian Cabala in the Renaissance” and “The Diffusion of Christian Cabala in Renaissance Culture” = CHAPTERS 1 and 2 of Spanish Christian Cabala , Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1986. In spite of its “assertive title” (the author’s term, page ii), The Rape of Jewish Mysticism by Christian Theologians by Robert Wang (Columbia [MD]: Marcus Aurelius Press, 2001) is a rather drab summary of well-known—and well- worn—sources. Wang does not make use of much scholarship since Gershom Scholem (works cited from 1941 and 1974) on kabbalah (though there is recourse to Moshe Idel, especially regarding Abraham Abulafia), Frances Yates (1964, 1979) and Francois Secret (1964) on cabala , Charles G. Nauert (1965) on Agrippa, and Peter French (1972) on Dee, etc. Moreover, he does not engage his thesis (i.e., rape of Jewish mysticism) except fleetingly anywhere through the book save the preface and the brief conclusion. The book comes to an anticlimactic halt with “Christian Kabbalah becomes Rosicrucianism,” “The Fama Fraternitas,” and “Robert Fludd.” Wang’s omission of develop- ments through the 17 th -19 th centuries is all the more puzzling given the book’s subtitle, How the Modern Occult Movement Grew out of Renaissance Attempts to Convert the Jews."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Criticisms of Blau’s conclusions are sprinkled through one of the more recent books given notice here, Alchemy of the Word: Cabala of the Renaissance (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998) by Ph ilip Beitchman, who draws on the research of the last 150 years, making full use of scholars ranging from Heinrich Graetz to Arthur Waite to Harold Bloom. Most of the contentious comments regarding Blau are derived from Francois Secret, whose works were among the most important sources for Beitchman. (From Beitchman’s book, one gets an idea of how much the English-only reader is missing in not having Secret’s studies available.) Alchemy of the Word is presented in four sections: The first, “In the Beginning,” traces Kabbalah and its influence from the Renaissance to the present-day. Beitchman puts some emphasis on the Kabbalah of the Zohar , treating a range of this central text’s concepts and difficulties. Included are arresting discussions of Kabbalah’s sexual symbolism and of the stress between (and attempted resolutions of) the notions of God’s immanence and transcendence. The second section, “The Secret of Agrippa,” begins with Pico, even while calling attention (relying on Secret) to cabalistic developments which predate Pico; it goes on to Reuchlin, as one would expect. Then to Agrippa; however, Beitchman does not dwell so much on De occulta philosophia as on Agrippa’s apparent self-refutation in De certitudine et vanitate omnium scientarum declamatio inuectiva (On the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Arts and Sciences), which Beitchman considers a manner of further cabalistic development on Agrippa’s part. The third section, entitled “Bibliographica Kabbalistica,” lists and, to one extent or another, describes a number of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century works which treat Cabala, whether sympathetically or otherwise. The promise of the chapter is undermined somewhat by Beitchman’s inconsistent treatment of the items included and his veering off the subject-at-hand so frequently. The final section, “The Kiss of the Spouse,” deals with (as the subheading suggests) “Cabala in England (1497-1700),” discussing Shakespeare, J ohn Dee, and Thomas Vaughan, among others. Throughout the book, themes and methods of Kabbalah/Cabala (which is spelled “cabala” through the text, yet peculiarly “kaballah” through the bibliography and index) are set against the notions of modern thinkers, philosophers, and writers (Freud, Kierkegard, and Kafka, to name a few). Beitchman freely and effectively draws on Gershom Scholem, Frances Yates, (as mentioned) Francois Secret, Harold Bloom, Lynn Thorndike (see “Items of Interest”) and others to compose this ranging view of Cabala and its diffusion. Alchemy of the Word is not a good introductory book; it would be best to have been through some of the other studies before engaging this one, i.e., Blau’s Christian Interpretation... , and Yates’ Occult Philosophy (see below, and see the footnote on page 3). It is something of a shame that Beitchman’s keen observations, insights, and humor are buried in such cumbersome prose, strained with interjections and qualifiers. (I do hope that he doesn’t feel that there is some form of ars kabbalistica in his over-interrupted sentences.) Moreover, there is Beitchman’s infatuation with the word ineluctable , which seems to appear at least once on nearly every page of the book. All the same, there is a wealth of valuable information and fine synthesis here. In the end, the book is well worth the discomfort. The classic English-language resource for our subject is Frances Yates’ Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979 and 2001; rpt. L ondon: Ark Paperbacks, 1983), which is divided into three parts: Part 1 covers the Renaissance and Reformation periods, discussing Llull, Pico, Reuchlin, Francesco Giorgi, and Agrippa; Part 2 takes up the Elizabethan period, treating, most significantly, John Dee and Shakespeare; Part 3 moves into Cabala’s connections with Rosicrucianism, occult philosophy and Puritanism (John Milton), and the return of the Jews to England in the seventeenth century. From reading Yates, we see how Cabala got smeared together with other pressing religious and philosophic concerns"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001 5 of the day (Hermetism, alchemy, astrology, and magic), and how the term “cabala” came to be used quite loosely, referring at times to stuff which no Jewish Kabbalist would recognize as such. Other books by Frances Yates are of great value to us here: • Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964; rpt. 1991) paraphrases the Hermetic writings which were most important to Ficino and company, treats Pico’s “Cabalist Magic” in some detail and summarizes the contents of Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia . This all leads to a discussion of Bruno’s Cabala, which, according to Yates, was derived primarily from Agrippa and remained rather dilute, being far less important to Bruno than his “Egyptianism.” Compare Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah: Prophets, Magicians, and Rabbis (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997) by Karen Silvia de Leon-Jones, who contends that Bruno’s knowledge and development of the Kabbalah were far more extensive than Yates suggests. In de Leon-Jones’ words, “Bruno does not merely present or discuss the Kabbalah, he transforms it, manipulates it, makes it his own, does it” ( Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , p. 6). Note, however, the objections of David Harari, “Was the Author of Cabala del Cavallo Pegaseo a Kabbalist?” (in Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts , Volume Four, edited by Daniel Abrams and Avraham Elqayam. Los Angeles [Culver City]: Cherub Press, 1999); resp onding to de Leon-Jones’ Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah , Harari suggests that Leone Ebreo was the author of Cabala del cavallo pegaseo , not Bruno, thus pulling the rug (i.e., the star textual witness) out from under de Leon-Jones’ thesis. The text in question, Cabala del cavallo pegaseo ( THE CABALA OF PEGASUS )—attributed to Bruno—has been translated and annotated by Sidney L. Sondergard and Madison U. Sowell (New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 2002). • The Art of Memory (University of Chicago Press, 1966; rpt. 1994) follows the met hods of “artificial memory” from the ancient Greek rhetoriticians to the seventeenth-century scientific philosophers. Of particular interest to us here are Yates’ chapters on Giulio Camillo’s Memory Theatre , which fused the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition to the art of memory. There are also chapters on the Art of Ramon Llull as a memory method, the memory systems of Giordano Bruno, and the Memory Theatre of Robert Fludd. • Theatre of the World (University of Chicago Press, 1969) picks up where Art of Memory leaves off concerning Robert Fludd and John Dee, considering both as perpetuators and propagators of “the Renaissance revival of Vitruvius.” As with Giordano Bruno and Art of Memory , Theatre of the World “carries” Yates’ series on Renaissance thought “in the direction of the English theatre, and another step towards Shakespeare.” • The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (London: Routledge, 1972; rpt. 1993 and 1996) discusses the Rosicrucian Manifestos of the early seventeenth century and the reactions which they stirred; the whole commotion was quite well entangled with the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition. In this work, Yates further emphasizes (or, as some think nowadays, exaggerates) the importance of John Dee. • “The Hermetic Tradition in Renaissance Science,” appears in Articles on Witchcraft, Magic and Demonology , Volume 11: RENAISSANCE MAGIC , edited by Brian P. Levack (New York/London: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1992; hereafter : Articles on Witchcraft 11). For a recent review of the “so-called Yates thesis,” namely Yates’ “Hermetic interpretation of the renaissance (sic a la Gatti), see Hilary Gatti, “Frances Yates’s Hermetic Renaissance in the Documents held in the Warburg Institute Archive,” in Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism, volume 2, number 2 (2002), Leiden-Boston-Koeln: Br ill. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Inevitably cited along with Yates’ studies is D.P. Walker’s Spiritual and Demonic Magic: From Ficino to Campanella (London: Notre Dame Press, 1958; rpt 1975; rpt. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000). Between Ficino (1433-99) and Campanella (1568- 1639) occurred developments of crucial importance to our line of inquiry, namely, the mixing of the demonic and the astrologic (as derived from Ficino), a mixture which turns up in one form in Agrippa’s synthesis of Medieval magic, De occulta philosophia , but in quite another in Francesco Giorgi’s De harmonia mundi totius . In the first section of Spiritual and Demonic Magic , Walker focuses on Ficino, in the second on what became of his magic in the sixteenth century, and in the third on the “Telesians” (named for Bernardo Telesio, philosopher and scientist, noted less for his ideas than for his methods of empirical science) and Tommaso Campanella. One impressive study details Pico’s contact with Kabbalah: Pico della Mirandola’s Encounter with Jewish Mysticism , by Chaim Wirszubski (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989), which discusses Pico’s sources and, in particular, considers his translator, Flavius Mithridates, who interjected more than a few interpolations into his renderings. Throughout, Pico’s famous Conclusiones are drawn upon for analysis. The appendices to this book, of which there are twenty-three, cover points of doctrine and history connected with Pico’s knowledge and development of Kabbalah. (It is interesting to note that Pico’s main sources for Kabbalah were Abraham Abulafia and Menahem Recanti.) There is one drawback to Wirszubski’s fine work: One needs to know Latin to read all the extracts from Pico and his translated sources. For a reliable complete edition of Pico’s Theses with an annotated English translation, see Stephen A. Farmer, Syncretism in the West: Pico’s 900 Theses (1486): The Evolution of Traditional Religious and Philosophical Systems (Tempe: Medieval and Renaissance Texts, 1998). Also in English, Pico’s On the Dignity of Man, On Being and the One, Heptaplus, translated by Charles Glenn Wallis, Paul J.W. Miller, and Douglas Carmichael respectively, with an introduction by Paul J.W. Miller [ THE LIBRARY OF LIBERAL ARTS ] (Indianapolis/New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1965). A translation of Pico’s Conclusiones Cabalisticae (extracted from the 900 Theses ) appears in A.E. Waite’s Holy Kabbalah (London: Williams & Norgate, Ltd, 1929; rpt. New Hyde Park: University Books, 1960, and subsequently; rpt. Carol Publishing Group, 1992) in a chapter entitled “Some Christian Students of the Kabbalah.” There, Waite gives sketches of Llull, Pico, Agrippa, Paracelsus, Reuchlin, Guillaume Postel, Robert Fludd, Henry More, Thomas Vaughan, Knorr von Rosenroth, Thomas Burnet, Ralph Cudworth, Louis Claude de St. Martin, Eliphas Levi, Papus (Gerard Encausse), Stanislas de Guita, H.P. Blavatsky, and a few others. Waite’s survey is quite useful, for its parade of names connected with Cabala—whether by fact or fancy—takes us from the Renaissance to the end of the nineteenth century. This collection of characters gives some idea of the range of Cabala’s seepage into all occult and Theosophic endeavor, including the symbolism of the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians.

The first, De verbo mirifico (1494), speaks of the “wonder-working word,” YHShVH , the miraculous name of Jesus derived from the tetragrammaton of the Old Testament: YHVH with the letter shin added. The second, De arte cabalistica (1516), is a broader, more informed excursion into various kabbalistic concerns. A discussion of Reuchlin’s writings, especially De verbo mirifico , constitutes the fourth chapter of The Most Ancient Testimony: Sixteenth-Century Christian-Hebraica in the Age of Renaissance Nostalgia , by Jerome Friedman (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1983). De arte cabalistica appeared in English translation in 1983 (Abaris B ooks, Inc.) and was reprinted with a new introduction by Moshe Idel in 1993 (Lincoln: Bison B ooks, University of Nebraska Press: On the Art of the Kabbalah ). Further on Reuchlin: • “Three Sixteenth-Century Attitudes to Judaism: Reuchlin, Erasmus, and Luther,” by Heiko Oberman, in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century , edited by Bernard Dov Cooperman (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983); • Christian D. Ginsburg’s description of De verbo mirifico in The Kabbalah (1864; published as The Essenes and the Kabbalah , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1956; rpt. Santa Fe: Sun Books, 1993), pp. 208-213; • Charles Zika’s “Reuchlin’s De verbo mirifico and the Magic Debate of the Late Fifteenth Century,” in Articles on Witchcraft 11 (Garland, 1992); • Joseph Dan’s article, “The Kabbalah of Johannes Reuchlin and Its Historical Significance,” which appears in The Christian Kabbalah: Jewish Mystical Books and Their Christian Interpreters , edited by Joseph Dan (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1997), and Dan’s collected articles, Jewish Mysticism, Volume III: THE MODERN PERIOD (Northvale: Jason Aronson Inc., 1999), which also contains Dan’s essay, “Christian Kabbalah: From Mysticism to Esotericism.” On Reuchlin, also see “Items of Interest” under Baron, Graetz, Oberman, and Thorndike. Francesco Giorgi (or Zorzi, 1467-1540) “has been considered a central figure in sixteenth-century Christian Kabbalah both by his contemporaries and by modern scholars. ... After Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who was the founder of the Christian kabbalah, Zorzi can claim second place,” writes Giulio Busi in “Francesco Zorzi: A Methodical Dreamer,” in The Christian Kabbalah (ed. Dan, Harvard College Library, 1997). Also see Yates’ chapter on Giorgi in Occult Philosophy (chapter V) and Walker’s Spiritual and Demonic Magic (pp. 112-119). Readers of French, see the chapters on Giorgi in Francois Secret’s Hermetisme et Kabbale ( LEZIONI DELLA SCUOLA DI STUDI SUPERIORI IN NAPOLI 15, Napoli: Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici, 1992). Following on Pico and Reuchlin was Henry Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim (1496-1535). His major work, De occulta philosophia (in three books), is a compendium of occult sciences. Agrippa’s account of cabala is found in Book III, coupled as it is with angelol ogy and demonology and the magic connected with these. There is a fine edition prepared by Donald Tyson, Three Books of Occult Philosophy (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1992), where De occulta philosophia is rightly referred to as “The Foundation Book of Western Occultism.” Indeed, no other book has contributed more to the Western magical-occult tradition than this— with its companion, the pseudo-Agrippan “Fourth Book,” which is a tract on ceremonial magic in the same spirit as the three true books (see Robert Turner, ed., Of Occult Philosophy: Book IV , Gillette: Heptangle Books, 1995). Tyson supplements Agrippa’s text with a substantial amount of well-researched support material covering such topics as “Practical Kabbalah,” “The Sephiroth,”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 “Magic Squares,” “Geomancy,” and others, in eight appendices, which makes this particular edition a valuable reference book. De occulta philosophia in English can be viewed on-line at Joseph H. Peterson’s Twilit Grotto site, www.esotericarchives.com and, as page-by-page images from the original, in Volume II of Esoterica: The Journal of Esoteric Studies (2000) at www.esoteric.msu.edu in the section called “Archival Works.” Agrippa’s De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum is available online (in both Latin and English) at Cornell University Library WITCHCRAFT COLLECTION site, at http://historical.library.cornell.edu/witchcraft/index.html (click browse > opening page: A). On Agrippa, see • Charles G. Nauert, Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought ( ILLINOIS STUDIES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES 55, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1965; for Agrippa’s cabalistic sources, see pp. 129-136); • Marc G. van der Poel, Cornelius Agrippa, The Humanist Theologian and His Declamations (Leiden / New York / Koln: Brill, 1997); • Christopher I.

Particularly on matters of Agrippa’s biography, van der Poel and Lehrich defer to Nauert as supplemented by the numerous articles of Paola Zambe lli, only a few of which are in English: • “Magic and Radical Reformation in Agrippa of Nettesheim,” in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 39 (1976) and Articles on Witchcraft 11 (Garland, 1992) • “Scholastic and Humanist Views of Hermeticism and Witchcraft,” in Hermeticism and the Renaissance: Intellectual History and the Occult in Early Modern Europe, edited by Ingrid Merkel and Allen G.

There is a well-developed literature on Dee—many more works than are listed here—including his own works in reprint as well as studies of his works and influence. Recent publications include these works by Dee: • Meric Casaubon’s presentation of Dee material: A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits (London: 1659; rpt. London: Askin, and Glasgow: Antonine Publishing Company, 1974; rpt. New York: Magickal Childe Publishing, 1992; rpt.

Walton and Phyllis J. Walton’s piece, “The Geometrical Kabbalahs of John Dee and Johannes Kepler: The Hebrew Tradition and the Mathematical Study of Nature,” in Experiencing Nature: Proceedings of a Conference in Honor of Allen G. Debus , edited by Paul H. Theerman and Karen Hunger Parshall (Dordrecht/Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997). Quite a bit of material on Dee is available on the Internet as, for example, The John Dee Society site at www.johndee.org , The John Dee Publication Project (for Enochian material) at www.dnai.com/~cholden , and Twilit Grotto (selected writings) at www.esotericarchives.com . Refer also to the bibliography, which is somewhat more extensive the one I have given, at www.nd.edu/~dharley/witchcraft/Dee.html . Dozens of books have been written about Enochian magic as derived from Dee’s work with Edward Kelley for the simple reason that the Golden Dawn incorporated a portion of it into their teachings. The Golden Dawn’s manner of Enochia was further developed by Aleister Crowley and subsequent authors and magickians , many of whom added elements which are quite alien to Dee’s work even while omitting well-nigh half of his original system. For an accurate impression of Dee and Kelley’s entire system, see Donald Tyson’s Enochian Magic for Beginners (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1997). The title is misleading; Tyson’s b ook is a thorough introduction, description, and appraisal. Further regarding the effects of Cabala in England, there is Daniel Banes’ Shakespeare, Shylock and Kabbalah (Silver Spring: Malcolm House Publications, 1978). Banes discusses J ohn Dee and Robert Fludd to establish the existence of Cabala in England. He then goes on the purpose of his book: “to identify some of the kabbalistic themes in The Merchant of Venice , and to relate them to antecedents in the literature of Kabbalah.” From Banes’ analysis, it would appear that Shakespeare was most indebted to Francisco Giorgi’s De harmonia mundi (1525) via the French version of it rendered by Guy le Fevre de la Boderie (1578). See also Banes’ Provocative Merchant of Venice (Silver Spring/Chicago: Malcolm House, 1975), which begins with a dismissive critique of Charles and Mary Lamb’s prose retelling of “The Merchant of Venice” and concludes with Banes’ “vagrant speculations” regarding the dependence of this famous work upon the Kabbalah’ i.e., he sets up a variant tree of life showing correspondences between the sefirot and the play’s dramatis personae . Among the names connected with Cabala are Paracelsus ( 1493-1541), Robert Fludd (1574-1637), and Guillaume Postel ( 1510-81). To Paracelsus, who is generally more associated with alchemy, the term “cabala” can be attached only in its broadest, most inexact sense, i.e., referring to astronomical and magical practices. Similarly, Dr. Fludd’s Cabala is a mixture of all sorts of stuff. Fludd did, however, expound upon the sefirot and the Hebrew letters (in the second book of Summum Bonum ) and charted their correspondences to the planets and holy names in a few places (e.g., in The Mosaicall Philosophy ; see below). Interestingly, while Fludd claimed Menahem Recanti as his kabbalistic authority, his sources were more apparently Pico, Reuchlin, and Agrippa. Guillaume Postel, on the other hand, produced a Latin translation of the Sefer Yezirah and penned some comments on it. He also translated portions of the Zohar , receiving guidance in its understanding from an unlikely tutor: an illiterate woman, though something of a sixteenth-century Mother Teresa, called Madre Zuana, or Mother Johanna—the Venetian Virgin. At various times, Postel identified her as mother of the world, the shekhinah , and the second messiah. Marion Kuntz writes, “As [Postel] worked on his translation of the Zohar , he became ever more convinced that the restitution of all things as interpreted by his Mother Johanna was confirmed not only in the ‘most divine and rare books of the Zohar ,’ but also in the books of the ancient [Jewish] interpreters...” ( Guillaume Postel , page 84—cited below)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001    11 Paracelsus, Fludd, and Postel are all discussed in A.E.

In the seventeenth century, two men account for the most significant promulgation of Kabbalah and Cabala outside Jewry: Francis Mercury van Helmont (1614-98) and Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-89). Van Helmont’s influence was surprisingly broad: from the Cambridge Platonists (in particular Henry More) to Liebniz (Kabbalah, as gathered by Leibniz through his contact with van Helmont and von Rosenroth, is thought to have influenced his concept of monads as well as his notions of free will).

Conway, as a student of both More and van Helmont, refuted the major philosophers of her time (Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza) with an array of concepts from Lurianic Kabbalah (as found in Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata ). As did van Helmont, Conway became a Quaker; also as van Helmont, she appears to have had some influence upon Leibniz.

Coudert, Richard Popkin, and Gordon M. Weiner (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998). Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, as translator, annotator, and editor, published the two-volume Kabbala denudata (Kabbalah Unveiled), which virtually alone represented Kabbalah to Christian Europe until the middle of the nineteenth century. These tomes contain an array of kabbalistic texts: sections of the Zohar , Pardes Rimmonim by Moses Cordovero, Sha’ar ha-Shamayim and Beit Elohim by Abraham Kohen (or Cohen) de Herrera, Sefer ha-Gilgulim (a Lurianic writing by Hayim Vital), and others, with commentaries by von Rosenroth himself and Henry More, and a summary of Christian Cabala ( Adumbratio Kabbalae Christianae ) by van Helmont—all in Latin translation. A few items from Kabbala denudata have been put into English: • S.L. MacGregor Mathers’ Kabbalah Unveiled (London: George Redway, 1887: rpt. New York/York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1968 and subsequently) gives three important texts from the Zohar : “The Book of Concealed Mystery, The Greater Holy Assembly, and the Lesser Holy Assembly.” • William Wynn Westcott’s edition of Aesch Mezareph , a kabbalistic-alchemical tract found in pieces throughout Kabbala denudata , as Volume IV of Collectanea Hermetica (1894). Aesch Mezareph was reprinted by Occult Research Press (New York: n.d.). Collectanea Hermetica , vols. I-VII, was reprinted by Kessinger Publishing Company (Kila: n.d.). Collectanea Hermetica , vols. I-X, was published by Samuel Weiser (1998); this special edition includes Westcott’s version of Sepher Yetzirah. • Christopher Atton and Stephen Dziklewicz’ Kabbalistic Diagrams of Rosenroth , with an introduction by Adam McLean [ MAGNUM OPUS HERMETIC SOURCEWORKS , Number 23] (London: The Hermetic Research Trust, 1987): Sixteen diagrams from Kabbala denudata are reproduced and translated. Figures 1-7 constitute one “great tree” depicting the structure of Adam Kadmon (= Primal Adam); figures 8-12 show a tree derived from Emek ha-Melech representing stages from the initial tzimtzum (contraction), through the emanations in the form of a wheel, to the second Adam Kadmon and the parzufim (faces); figures 13 and 14 show the sefirot in the world of azilut . Figures 15 and 16 depict the sefirot and so forth brought down in various ways to the lower worlds. All of the diagrams are based on the Lurianic system. Unfortunately, volumes in the HERMETIC SOURCEWORKS series were run in limited editions of 250 copies. Some titles—alas, not Kabbalistic Diagrams— have subsequently been reprinted.

Herrera’s Puerta del cielo found its way into von Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata through its Hebrew version, Sha’ar ha-Shamayim, the original having been in Spanish. Knorr’s rendition is far from a fair representation of Herrera’s original work—which Krabbenhoft offers in GATE OF HEAVEN —for “Aboab [who executed the Hebrew translation] did not just translate [Herrera’s works] but also radically altered the texts according to his own interpretation” ( The Mystic Tradition [noted below], p. 21); von Rosenroth further condensed the work in the process of putting it into Latin, emphasizing its philosophical passages. Herrera’s Beit Elohim (originally Casa de la divinidad ) also made an appearance in Kabbala denudata . Further on Herrera, see • Krabbenhoft, Kenneth. The Mystic Tradition.

Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987. For more on von Rosenroth, see the items by Allison Coudert noted above, especially The Impact of the Kabbalah in the Seventeenth Century , where a substantial section of the book is devoted to von Rosenroth and the ingredients of Kabbala denudata . One other character of the seventeenth century requires mention: Athanasius Kircher (1601-80), whom Yates describes as “a most notable descendant of the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition founded by Pico.” She also points out that “Kircher maintained the full Renaissance attitude to Hermes Trismegistus, completely ignoring Casaubon.” (Yates makes similar comments about Robert Fludd. It was Isaac Casaubon who, in 1614, through careful and thorough scholarship, showed that the Hermetica were “not the work of very ancient Egyptian priests but written in post- Christian times.”) Kircher maintained similar erroneous attitudes toward Cabala and Hebraica. See Yates’ discussion in Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition . There are three wonderfully illustrated works on Kircher: • Joscelyn Godwin’s Athanasius Kircher: A Renaissance Man in Search of Lost Knowledge (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1979). • Ingrid D. Rowland’s Ecstatic Journey: Athanasius Kircher in Baroque Rome (Chicago: University of Chicago Library, 2000), an exhibition catalogue of “Kircher’s amazing world of magic lanterns, volcanoes, fossils, flying cats, hieroglyphics, and practical jokes with the most serious of intentions.” • The Great Art of Knowing: The Baroque Encyclopedia of Athanasius Kircher edited by Daniel Stolzenberg (Stanford: Stanford University Libraries, 2001), a series of articles"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"   16 which also serves as an exhibition catalogue to and celebration of Stanford’s 1998 acquisition of all but one of Kircher’s works in first editions. Recent essays on Kircher appear in Athanasius Kircher: The Last Man Who Knew Everything , edited by Paula Findlen (New York/ London: Routledge, 2003). Kircher is also discussed at some length in Umberto Eco’s Search for the Perfect Language (Oxford/Cambridge: Blackwell Publishers, 1995). On the Internet, see the list of pages which treat Kircher at Athanasius Kircher on the Web ( www.bahnhof.se/~rendel/kirlinx.html ). One site not listed there, the attractive Museum of Jurasic Technology ( www.mjt.org ), has a series of articles on Kircher’s life and works (in Collections and Exhibitions, Gallery 6: The Coolidge Pavilion). In the eighteenth century, quite a bit of kabbalistic influence appears to trace to a single individual. There is evidence that, among others, Emanuel Swedenborg ( 1688-1772) and Alessandro Cagliostro (1743-95) were indebted to Samuel Falk (ca 1710-82), a Polish Kabbalist known as the “ Ba`al Shem of London” ( ba`al shem , master of the name, i.e., one who uses holy names in performing magical operations and writing amulets). Falk supposedly introduced aspects of Kabbalah to a number of Christian scholars. Falk, Swedenborg, and Cagliostro are discussed in Joscelyn Godwin’s Theosophical Enlightenment (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994: CHAPTER 5). Godwin’s main sources of information on this trio were two works of Marsha Keith Schuchard: • Freemasonry, Secret Societies, and the Continuity of the Occult Tradition in English Literature (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas, Austin: 1975)* which contains such chapters as I. “The Cabala, Sexual Magic, and the Jewish Visionary Traditions,” II. “The Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance, and the Development of the Syncretic Occult Tradition” (based primarily on Scholem, Yates, and Waite) and VIII. “Cabalistic and Magnetic Visions among the London Swedenborgians in the 1780’s and 1790’s,” before giving “special emphasis...to William Blake from 1780 to 1827” in CHAPTERS IX through XIII. ( Schuchard’s dissertation can be obtained from UMI Dissertation Services, on the Internet at www.il.proquest.com .) • “Yeats and the ‘Unknown Superiors’: Swedenborg, Falk and Cagliostro,” in Secret Texts: The Literature of Secret Societies , edited by Marie Mulvey Roberts and Hugh Ormsby- Lennon (New York: AMS Press, 1994) where Schuchard pr ovocatively suggests that the Unknown Superiors (i.e., of illuminist masonry, Falk in particular) may lurk in the obscure origins of the Golden Dawn. This is an expanded version of the article of the same name, subtitled “A short paper read at the Golden Dawn 100 th Anniversary Conference organised by Hermetic Research Trust on 25 th and 26 th April 1987,” in The Hermetic Journal , Issue Number 37, edited by Adam McLean (Tysoe: The Hermetic Research Trust, Autumn 1987).

While intrigued by Schuchard’s portrait of Falk, Ruderman expresses a desire for more research and firmer evidence. Note also the highly critical review of Schuchard’s work on Swedenborg in the article, “Schuchard’s Swedenborg,” by the Reverend Brian Talbot at The Swedenborg Project’s site, www.newchurchissues.org/SR/schurev1.htm .

Hanegraaff (Leuven [Belgium]: Peeters, 1998). For a detailed preamble to Schuchard’s items above, see her hefty Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and the Stuart Culture [Brill’s Studies in Intellectual History, v. 110] (Leiden: Br ill Academic Publishers, 2002), which takes us from the influence of “Jewish mathematical and architectural mysticism” upon medieval Masonic guilds ( CHAPTER ONE ) to “The Ruined Temple and the Flight of Knights” of the seventeenth-century ( CHAPTER TWELVE ). Schuchard “concentrate(s) on certain themes that define the Stuart Masonic mentality—i.e., Jewish and Scottish architectural mysticism; Jewish and Llullist mnemonic-visualization techniques; Cabalistic and Hermetic sexual theosophy; Rosicrucian and Masonic scientific schemes; crusader chivalry and illuminated knighthood; liberty of conscience and universal brotherhood” ( INTRODUCTION , page 7). If we follow this obscure line of Cabalists, Swedenborgians, and Freemasons, we eventually come to William Blake ( 1757-1827), who, as we have seen, is discussed in the dissertation of Marsha Keith Schuchard. On Blake, also see Schuchard’s articles: • “The Secret Masonic History of Blake’s Swedenborg Society,” in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly , vol. 26, no. 2 (1992); • “Blake and the Grand Masters (1791-4): Architects of Repression or Revolution?” in Blake in the Nineties , edited by Steve Clark and David Worrall (London/New York: Macmillan Press Ltd/St. Martins Press, Inc., 1999); • “Why Mrs. Blake Cried: Blake, Swedenborg, and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision,” in Esoterica: The Journal of Esoteric Studies , Volume II, edited by Arthur Versluis (2000, on-line at www.esoteric.msu.edu ). Further on Blake and Swedenborg, find the collection of articles edited by Harvey F. Bellin and Darrell Ruhl: Blake and Swedenborg: Opposition Is True Friendship , The Sources of William Blake’s Arts in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (New York: Swedenborg Foundation Inc., 1985), and Robert Rix’s article, “W illiam Blake and the Radical Swedenborgians,” on-line at Esoterica (cited above), Volume V (2003), and Joseph Viscomi’s piece, “In the Caves of Heaven and Hell: Swedenborg and Printmaking in Blake’s Marriage ,” in Blake in the Nineties , edited by Steve Clark and David Worrall (Hampshire and London: Macmillan Press Ltd / New York: St, Martin’s Press, Inc., 1999). One can sift through the daunting tonnage of Blake studies and find scant mention of Kabbalah/Cabala, even if esoteric currents are acknowledged as reflected in Blake’s work. Thus, most welcome is the recent study of the influence of Kabbalah/Cabala on Blake: Sheila Spector’s well-illustrated companion volumes “ Wonders Divine”: The Development of Blake’s Kabbalistic Myth and “Glorious Incomprehensible”: The Development of Blake’s Kabbalistic Language (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, both 2001.

Spector writes ( “Wonders Divine , ” page 25) ...even though he [Blake] explicitly, often even emphatically, rejected many aspects of what might be called normative Christianity, he still found himself trapped within what had become the oppressive archetypal framework he repudiated, and it was only through"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001    19 a concerted life-long effort, first to recognize the bonds, and then, to seek out alternate modes of thought, that Blake was able, finally, to create his own system. But that new system, contrary to popular belief, was not an original creation. Rather, when Blake finally liberated himself from the exoteric myth structure that dominates Western thought, he turned to its esoteric counterpart, the myth that, though originating with Jewish mystics, had been adapted by Christian Kabbalists to conform with their—and, in fact, with Blake’s—own brand of Christianity. For more on Blake and Kabbalah, see Spector’s articles: • “Kabbalistic Sources—Blake’s and His Critics’,” in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly 67 , volume 17, number 3 (Winter 1983-84), an extremely useful article which contains (i) a review of scholars who broach the issue of Kabbalah in connection with Blake (ii) a discussion of the problems surrounding the scholarly approach to Kabbalah itself (iii) a survey of sources of Kabbalah which could have been available to Blake. • “The Reasons for ‘Urizen’” in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly 21, no. 4 (Spring 1988); • “Hebraic Etymologies of Proper Names in Blake” in Philological Quarterly 67, no. 3 (Summer 1988). • “Sources and Etymologies of Blake’s ‘Tirzah’” in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly 23, no. 4 (Spring 1990). • “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” in Blake and His Bibles , edited by David V. Erdman ([ LOCUST HILL LITERARY STUDIES , No. 1] West Cornwall: Locust Hill Press, 1990). • “Blake’s Milton as Kabbalistic Vision” in Religion and Literature 25, no. 1 (Spring 1993). Also in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly 46 (volume 12, number 2 [Fall 1978]—an issue which focuses on The Four Zoas , a long poem among Blake’s “major prophecies”)—see Terrence Allan Hoagwood’s article, “ The Four Zoas and ‘The Philosophick Cabbala.’” Hoagwood writes (page 87): “The Philosophick Cabbala,” part of [Henry] More’s retelling of the fall of man as narrated in the Book of Genesis, bears close resemblance in many points to Blake’s retelling of the fall of man in The Four Zoas . Further, there is Asloob Ahmad Ansari’s article, “Blake and the Kabbalah,” in William Blake: Essays for S. Foster Damon , edited by Alvin H. Rosenfeld (Providence: Brown University Press, 1969); and the only other b ook-length treatment ( 130 pp.) of Blake’s Kabbalah which I have gotten a look at: Clay Mathew Bowman’s M.A. paper, The Divine Family in Blake’s “The Four Zoas”: A Comparison of the Divine Family Motif in Blake and the Kabbalah (Houston: University of Houston, 1987). Neither of these, however, is as useful as the works listed above. There is also Dena Donna Cheryl Taylor’s Emanations of the Divine: Kabbalistic Elements in the Poetry and Designs of William Blake (Ph.D. dissertation, Toronto: University of Toronto, 1983), which I have not seen."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"   20 Part 2* The nineteenth century opened with the production of a book which was, for the most part, an unacknowledged copy of Agrippa (his De occulta philosophia and the pseudo-Agrippan Fourth Book ), along with material from The Heptameron (attributed to Peter of Abano), Giambattista della Porta’s Magia naturalis , and other sources—namely, Francis Barrett’s tome, The Magus, or Celestial Intelligencer (London: 1801). While no great sc hool accumulated around Barrett which we know of, his book inaugurated an era of renewed interest in Hermetic-Cabalist Magic, which seems to have been as uncritically accepted in the early 1800s as it had been in the Renaissance. Several reprints of The Magus have gone to press in the last several decades, such as the 1967 edition of University Books (New Hyde Park), the ubiquitous 1975 paperback of Citadel Press (Secaucus), and the Samuel Weiser reprint (York Beach: 2000) which includes full-color reproductions of the plates. The Magus can also be viewed on-line at the Sacred Texts site: www.sacred-texts.com/grim/magus/ . The always readable Francis X King ( aka Francis King) composed a slim book on Barrett based on the rather limited documentation concerning him as a daring though failure-prone experimental balloonist as well as a plagiarizing occultist, along with “Barrett’s Hitherto Unpublished Skrying Manuscript”: The Flying Sorcerer (Oxford: Mandrake, 1992). For another account—indeed, a defense—of Barrett, see “Beyond Attribution: The Importance of Barrett’s Magus ,” which constitutes CHAPTER TWO of The Revival of the Occult Philosophy: Cabalistic Magic and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , by Alison L. Butler (M.A. thesis, St. John’s: Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2000), a trimmed version of which appears as the lead article in The Journal for the Academic Study of Magic Issue 1 (Oxford: Mandrake, 2003). Other accounts of Barrett can be found in Christopher McIntosh, The Devil’s Bookshelf (Welling- borough: The Aquarian Press, 1985— CHAPTER 13, “Magic in the Nineteenth Century”), and Joscelyn Godwin, The Theosophical Enlightenment (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994— CHAPTER SIX , “Neophytes and Initiates”). When the nineteenth century was about at its midpoint, there began a fairly steady stream of European works on Kabbalah and Cabala. Some of these were serious, even if not entirely successful, attempts to present the Jewish Kabbalah on its own terms, such as the works of Adolphe Franck, C.D. Ginsburg, and A.E. Waite. Others knotted together various Christianized strands, adorning them with other doctrines and currents, as did Eliphas Levi, H.P. Blavatsky, Papus, and Aleister Crowley. Some notable authors apparently had Masonic agenda, like Albert Pike, Ralston Skinner, and co-authors Bond and Lea. Works from this checkered array remain the basis of Kabbalah/Cabala study among great numbers of (primarily Christian) esoteric readers and researchers—even today—in spite of the contributions of Jewish and Christian scholars of the last fifty-plus years. ________________ * It would be profitable to compare my listings with those in Sheila Spector’s Jewish Mysticism: An Annotated Bibliography on Kabbalah in English (New York/ London: Garland Publishing, 1984), Section O: “Non-Jewish Kabbalah,” pages 309-357. The first division of this section, “Primary Sources,” begins with “J.F.’s” 1651 translation of Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia ; ironically, the second division, “Secondary Sources,” begins with Francis Barrett’s Magus (1801). Spector’s listings go through 1983. She includes—and comments on—quite a few items not given notice in my paper: • rare items and manuscripts, such as seventeenth-century editions of van Helmont’s works in English; • 19 th - and early 20 th -century items which touch upon Kabbalah, or Cabala, only briefly or incidentally, like William Story’s Proportions of the Human Figure... (London: Chapman and Hall, 1866) or George Alexander Kohut’s Ezra Stiles and the Jews (New York: Philip Cowen, 1902); • works which I have never encountered, for example Laurel Miller’s Kabbalistic Numerology (New York: Metaphysical Publishing House, 1921) or F. Schneider Schwartz’ True Mysteries of Life (New York: Vantage Press, 1957)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001    21 Among the influential books which were written in English, or which have been translated into English, are the following: Franck, Adolphe.

Sossnitz, 1909; abridged English edition, New York: Bell Publishing Company, 1940. Despite his errors, Franck still commands a fair amount of regard. As noted by Moshe Idel ( Kabbalah: New Perspectives [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988]: pp. 7-10) some of Franck’s conclusions bear notable similarities to those of Gershom Scholem, most importantly that Kabbalah was a vital force at the “heart and soul” of Judaism, not the aberrant and heretical side shoot which historians such as Heinrich Graetz and other “enlightened” scholars of the nineteenth century thought it was. Franck brought to a common modern language (French—and a year later Adolph Jellinek put Franck’s Kabbalah into German) a reasoned account of Kabbalah with informed descriptions of Sefer Yezirah and the Zohar . Franck’s major error was finding in Zoroastrian lore the source of Kabbalistic concepts. His mistakes notwithstanding, Franck’s serious attempt to present the Kabbalah from its own sources stands in marked contrast with another French writer who began to publish some dozen years later: Eliphas Levi, who took every liberty his imagination could conceive in presenting Kabbalah/Cabala and other esoteric subjects.

Philadelphia: Moss and Co., 1873 and 1878; revised edition, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts and Co., 1894; reprint Kilo: Kessinger, n.d.

One might assume that Ginsburg was a sympathetic commentator, for he outlined the traditional history of the Kabbalah “as told by its followers”; but obliquely in this book and more openly in subsequent articles, Ginsburg showed his hostility toward Kabbalah to be equal to—and perhaps derived from—Graetz’s. In an article which Ginsburg co-wrote with S.A. Cook, there is a reference to the Zohar as “that farrago of absurdity.” Ginsburg considered the Zohar a fraud perpetrated by Moses de Leon. Even so, his Kabbalah gives an admirable account of its subject. This book is, in form, an expanded outline, so its manner is somewhat clipped, though dense with information. There are lots of biblical and Zoharic references, and great detail on such topics as the 72 names of God and the hermeneutical conventions, gematria, notaricon, and terumah . ( NOTE : These methods predated Kabbalah by centuries. Gematria in particular, which is so often treated as central to the Kabbalah by Christian commentators, played only a limited role in such kabbalistic classics as the Zohar , the works of Moses Cordovero, and the Lurianic compendia assembled by Hayim Vital. See Scholem’s article, “Gematria,” in Kabbalah [Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1974; New York: Dorset Press, 1987]; and Dan’s comments in “Christian Kabbalah: From Mysticism to Esotericism,” in Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion , edited by A.

Already on page 15, the 1 st degree Apprentice is told, “...you must open the pages of the Sohar (i.e., Zohar ) and Siphre de Zeniutha, and other kabbalistic books, and ponder deeply on their meaning.” From there on, the book is quite full of kabbalistic references and passages. Unfortunately, the bulk of these were lifted from one of the most unreliable sources: Eliphas Levi, whom Pike quotes freely without acknowledgement.

( Book of Dzyan , Stanza II, Section 1) Throughout the compendious works of Mme. Blavatsky (hereafter HPB), Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine , are numerous references to Kabbalah, and some passages which deal at length with kabbalistic doctrine. But in the collection of articles published together as Kabalah and Kabalism , HPB made it most clear that she believed that 1. “Kabalah” was inferior to “our (Eastern) septenary system”;"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"   24 2. kabbalistic writings had “all suffered corruptions in their content by sectarian editors”; 3. there was “evidence of occult knowledge in the West,” even though HPB saw fit to expose “[its] limitations” and point to “the misleading character of Kabalistic symbolism.” With all of this, HPB claimed to be restoring the true meaning of kabbalistic doctrine according to Chaldean originals known to her—and only to her. She did condescend to say that “the Jews can claim the Zohar, Sepher Yetzirah, Sepher Dzeniuta and a few others, as their own undeniable property and as Kabalistic works,” referring to the Zohar and Sifre Detzeniuta as if they were separate works. HPB’s attitude would raise eyebrows had she been the all-knowing scholar that she claimed to be. However, these statements come from one whose references to Kabbalah are shot through with serious errors and misunderstandings. HPB had but a cursory knowledge of the subject, and that from easily traceable sources. For our own part we regard her neither as the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar adventuress; we think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting impostors in history. (Society for Psychical Research: 1883, report) Gershom Scholem writes ( Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , pp. 398-9) There can be little doubt in my opinion that the famous stanzas of the mysterious Book Dzyan on which Mme. H.P. Blavatsky’s magnum opus , The Secret Doctrine, is based owe something, both in title and content, to the pompous pages of the Zoharic writing called Sifra Di-Tseniutha . The first to advance this theory, without further proof, was L.A. Bosman, a Jewish Theosophist, in his booklet The Mysteries of the Qabalah ( 1916) p. 31. This seems to me, indeed, the true ‘etymology’ of the hitherto unexplained title. Mme Blavatsky has drawn heavily upon Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata (1677-1684), which contains (vol. II, pp. 347-385) a Latin translation of the Sifra Di- Tseniutha . The solemn and magniloquent style of these pages may well have impressed her susceptible mind. As a matter of fact, H.P.B. herself alludes to such a connection between the two ‘books’ in the very first lines of Isis Unveiled (vol. I, p. 1) where she still refrains from mentioning the Book Dzyan by name. But the transcription used by her for the Aramaic title shows clearly what she had in mind. She says: ‘There exists some- where in this wide world an old Book... It is the only copy now in existence. The most ancient Hebrew document on occult learning—the Siphra Dzeniuta—was compiled from it .’ The Book Dzyan is therefore nothing but an occultistic hypostasy of the Zoharic title. This ‘bibiographical’ connection between fundamental writings of modern and Jewish theosophy seems remarkable enough. If one takes a lenient view, HPB’s sources could be blamed for the bulk of her errors, for many of these had indeed “suffered corruptions in their content by sectarian editors”: 1. from Pico to Knorr von Rosenroth, Christian cabalists believed that with kabbalistic methods rightly used, Jews could be shown the “truth” behind the Old Testament and won over to Christ; 2.

Isaac Myer, whose earnest study contains many errors, some of which even HPB did not commit, as, for example, Myer’s mix-up of the roles and order of the sefirot , calling binah the second and hokhmah the third (Myer, Qabbalah , pp. 259-63). But with these sources and others, we cannot account for all of HPB’s blunders. She alone refers to the Talmud as the “darkest of enigmas even for most Jews, while those Hebrew scholars who do comprehend it do not boast of their knowledge” ( Isis Unveiled , vol. I, p. 17), and she is unique in considering Liber Drushim as part of that murky Talmud ( The Secret Doctrine , Adyar edition, vol. 2, p. 156). The nature of the Talmud is well known. As for Liber Drushim (= Sefer ha-Derushim ), it is a sixteenth-century tract of the Lurianic school which HPB undoubtedly encountered in Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata . Further, her statements regarding the authorship of the Zohar , which are sprinkled through The Secret Doctrine , contradict one another and mix history, legend, and imagination differently with each reference. Pancoast, S[eth]. The Kabbala: The True Science of Light. An Introduction to the Philosophy and Theosophy of the Ancient Sages, Together with a Chapter on Light in the Vegetable Kingdom. Philadelphia: J.M. Studdart and Co., 1877; New York: R. Worthington, 1883. Pancoast makes two remarks in his introduction which, along with his ties with Mme. Blavatsky (as her physician), indicate his perspective: ...the grand old Kabbalistic Theosophy was the native root, the central trunk, whence all the religions the world has ever known sprang, as shoots and branches from a parent tree... ...the special purpose of this volume is to promote the well-being of mankind in this probationary world, by advocating Light and its Rays as the best remedial means for the Human Organism, when from any cause, internal or external, the equilibrium of health is disturbed, and disease wastes the body and deranges the mind—nay, even when there is no clearly defined disease, but only feebleness and indisposition for physical and mental effort. These ideas are bridged in statements such as Light is the foundation upon which rests the superstructure of the Kabbalistic Theosophy—Light the source and centre of the entire harmonious system. Light was the first-born of God—His first manifestation. Pancoast combines Kabbalistic Theosophy, the science and medicine of his day with its fascination with magnetism and electricity, and esoteric methods of “assisting nature” with “applications of Light” for the purpose of physical and mental health.

Aleister Crowley, in The Equinox (vol. 1, no. 5, 1911) writes, “For the student unacquainted with the rudiments of the Qabalah we recommend the study of S.L.M. Mathers’ ‘Introduction’ to his translation of the three principle books of the Zohar, and Westcott’s ‘Introduction to the Study of the Qabalah.’ ... Dr. Westcott’s little book is principally valuable for its able defense of the Qabalah as against exotericism and literalism.” Mathers, S[amuel] L[iddell] MacGregor. The Kabbalah Unveiled. London: George Redway, 1887; revised edition with a preface by Moina Mathers, L ondon: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1926; rpt. New York: Samuel Weiser, 1968—reprinted frequently. Mathers is a particularly important figure in that he, with W.W. Westcott, was one of the founders of the Golden Dawn. As author of most of the Golden Dawn rituals and many of its instructions, he was instrumental in laying the groundwork for modern occultism. However, as a translator and commentator in the field of Kabbalah, he was prey to—and perpetuator of—much misunderstanding and misinformation. An easy way to demonstrate this is to look at a couple of lists which Mathers gives in The Kabbalah Unveiled . On page 14, as the most important kabbalistic books, Mathers lists the following: (a) The Sepher Yetzirah and its dependencies. (b) The Zohar with its developments and commentaries. (c) The Sepher Sephiroth and its expansions. (d) The Asch Metzareph and its symbolism. With the first two entries there can be no argument: the Sefer Yezirah and the Zohar are two of the most important and influential works in Kabbalah. But the third and fourth entries simply do not belong. With evidence of Mathers’ dependence on Rosenroth, we can fairly assume the “Sepher Sephiroth” refers to the section of Kabbala denudata which treats of the unfolding of the tree of the sefirot , in outline, then diagrammatic, form based upon Israel Sarug’s version of the teachings of Isaac Luria. It is an item of considerable interest, but not one of the canons of Kabbalah. “Asch Metzareph” ( Esh M’zaref ) is a rather unusual example of the merger of Kabbalah and alchemy. As such, it is something of a peripheral curiosity, not a central work. On pages 14 and 15, Mathers gives a list of “the most important books” contained in the Zohar : "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0001\u0004\u000b\u0001\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0001\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0001\u0013\u0001\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0001\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0001\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0001\u0013\u0001\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0001    27 (a) The SPRA DTzNIOVThA, Siphra Dtzenioutha, of “Book of Concealed Mystery,” which is the root and foundation of the Zohar. (b) The ADRA RBA QDIShA, Idra Rabba Qadisha, or “Greater Holy Assembly”: this is a development of the “Book of Concealed Mystery.” (c) The ADRA ZVTA QDIShA, Idra Zuta Qadisha, or “Lesser Holy Assembly” (d) The pneumatical treatise called BITh ALHIM, Beth Elohim, or the “House of Elohim,” ...from the doctrines of Rabbi Yitzchaq Loria... (e) The “Book of the Revolutions of Souls”...an expansion of Rabbi Loria’s ideas. It is true that by the time we get to Luria (= Loria), the themes begun in Sifra Detzeniuta and the Idrot [(b) and (c)] were considered central to the Zohar , but in a purely zoharic context these texts are something of an oddity. Mathers ignored, or was ignorant of, the real core and bulk of the Zohar : the running commentary to the Torah. As with the previous list, the last two items simply do not belong. As Mathers even notes, they are Lurianic, which separates them from the Zohar by nearly 300 years.* Mathers’ Kabbalah Unveiled is an English translation of (a), (b), and (c) of the second list as rendered from Knorr von Rosenroth’s Latin: Kabbala denudata . The translation is full of extranea—some Knorr’s, some Mathers’—so it is hardly a fair representation of these texts. (I recommend the translation of Roy A.

New York: Samuel Weiser, 1970; rpt. San Diego: Wizards B ookshelf, 1988. Myer’s book discusses Gebirol’s work in relation to the Zohar and analyzes his Mekor Hayim . The bulk of the book is a survey of Kabbalah’s history and relationship to other religious systems. Myer’s last chapters are devoted to translated excerpts from the Zohar . Myer confused, or reinterpreted, some doctrine, e.g., the roles and order of the second and third sefirot : hokhmah and binah . Papus [= Gerard Encausse]. Qabalah: Secret Tradition of the West. French original, 1892; English translation, Wellingborough: Thorsons and New York: Samuel Weiser, 1977. Qabalah is a hodge-podge of Jewish and Christian, cabalistic and non-cabalistic elements. Several writers contributed to the work: Eliphas Levi, Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, and “Sedir.” Papus himself drew on the works of Kircher, Lenain, Stanislas de Guaita, Heinrich Khunrath, and others, primarily Christian occultists, putting this work firmly in the Hermetic-Cabalist vein. It contains an eclectic bibliography which includes all sorts of stuff, much of which has nothing whatsoever to do with Cabala. __________ * Quite a few subsequent writers have accepted Mathers and his lists, especially the first, as authoritative. For instance, Charles Ponce in Kabbalah (San Francisco: Straight Arrow Books, 1973), pages 50-52, includes Esh Mezaref in his list, “Other Main Works of Kabbalism.” Typical of Ponce, he sets two perfectly viable choices ( Sefer Bahir and Cordovero’s Pardes Rimmonim ) against two items with no real place on the list ( Esh Mezaref and The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom ). Mme. Blavatsky, too, referred to Esh Mezaref as one of the most important books in Kabbalah. As noted above, she and Mathers both made heavy use of von Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata .

Frater Achad is generally considered Aleister Crowley’s most important student. Achad expands upon the Golden Dawn qabalah , establishing some of his own variations on such things as the attributions of the Hebrew letters and their correspondences to the paths of the kabbalistic tree of life , in one book, The Egyptian Revival , turning the attribution system established by the Golden Dawn completely upside-down. A more recent writer, considered by many to be Crowley’s true heir, is Kenneth Grant, whose numerous books treat qabalah throughout. See, for example, Grant’s summary statements regarding the qabalistic tradition in Beyond the Mauve Zone (London: Starfire Publishing Ltd, 1999), Chapter 8: “The Metaphysics of Transmission.” Mention of Grant leads inevitably to the subject of the OTO , Ordo Templi Orientis —a can of worms, indeed. Perhaps the best single book on this still-functioning order is O.T.O. Rituals and Sex Magick , by Theodor Reuss and Aleister Crowley, compiled and edited by A.R. Naylor, introduced by Peter-R. Koenig - (Thame: I-H-O Books, 1999). Though published in 1999, the b ook is already out of print, commanding high prices, many times its original $50 cover price. The bulk of the book is OTO documents, which, apparently, the active OTO groups are not pleased to see in print.

Mathers, W.W. Westcott (both of whom are represented in the list above), and a third, apparently less significant, gentleman named W.R. Woodman. Mathers and Westcott concocted an eclectic program of occult study containing quite a bit of Cabala as derived from the Christian sources we have discussed: Agrippa, Dee, von Rosenroth, etc. For better or worse, Golden Dawn teachings have become the cornerstone for much—if not most—of the occult work practiced today. The history of the Golden Dawn has been quite intelligently written about by Francis King, R.A. Gilbert and Ellic Howe; refer to “Items of Interest” for books by these writers. The bulk of the Golden Dawn teachings, through its own documents, has been generally available since Israel Regardie’s four-volume edition of The Golden Dawn, 1937-40 (Chicago: Aries Press; frequent reprints were begun by Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul: 1969). Be yond Regardie’s full selection, other books which present further Golden Dawn documents of some significance include the following: Mathers, S.L. MacGregor, et al. Astral Projection, Ritual Magic, and Alchemy . Edited by Francis King; 1 st edition London: Spearman, 1971; rpt. New York: Samuel Weiser, 1975; 2 nd enlarged edition, Rochester: Destiny Books, 1987. This book presents the “Flying Rolls,” i.e., the instructional materials handed around to Golden Dawn members, not included in Regardie’s collection. The 2 nd edition adds some material. Torrens, R.G. The Secret Rituals of the Golden Dawn . New York: Samuel Weiser Inc., 1973. Torrens gives historical accounts and doctrinal summaries and alternative (early) versions of the Outer Order rituals. Gilbert, R.A. The Golden Dawn Companion. Wellingborough: Aquarian Press, 1986. This Companion is a wealth of documentary minutia on the Golden Dawn’s history, structure, workings, membership, and sources. Zalewski, Patrick J. Secret Inner Order Rituals of the Golden Dawn. Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1988. Zalewski gives the 6=5 and 7=4 (i.e. The Inner Order) rituals not included by Regardie. The quintessential example of the Golden Dawn’s brand of Qabalistic synthesis is Aleister Crowley’s Liber 777 , which consists of table after table of correspondence—nearly 200 columns—arranged according to the ten sefirot and the twenty-two paths which interconnect them. This work calls itself a “Qabalistic dictionary of ceremonial magic, oriental mysticism, comparative religion and symbology.” Among the sources which the introduction acknowledges are Kabbala denudata , “the lost symbolism of the Vault in which Christian Rosenkreutz is said to have been buried,” Dee, Agrippa, the “Art” of Ramon Llull, Pietro di Abano, Eliphas Levi, to mention those who have been connected, however loosely, with Cabala. The preface of 777 goes on to say, “The Chinese, Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem, and Egyptian systems have never before been brought into line with the Qabalah; the Tarot has never been made public.” 777 was reprinted with two other “Qabalistic” items as The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley (New York: Samuel Weiser Inc., 1973; this collection has been reprinted a few times).

A student of Fortune’s, Gareth Knight, produced a compendious study, A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (Helios Book Service [UK], 1965; New York: Samuel Weiser, 1978), which offers a thorough compilation of the Golden Dawn’s “qabalah of correspondence” in its 500-plus pages. Among the books on Kabbalah/Cabala which are often recommended by students of Golden Dawn-type occultism are Waite’s Holy Kabbalah , Myer’s Qabbalah , and Ginsburg’s Kabbalah ; these are thought to be the “serious... difficult...scholarly” books on the subject. Considered more practical are Fortune’s Mystical Qabalah and the popular series by William Gray, which includes The Talking Tree (1977), The Ladder of the Lights (1981), Concepts of the Qabalah (1984) and The Tree of Evil (revised edition, 1985; all titles, New York: Samuel Weiser). Concepts of Qabalah is Volume 3 of Gray’s SANGREAL SODALITY SERIES : Vol. 1. Western Inner Workings (1983); Vol. 2. The Sangreal Sacrament (1983); Vol. 4. Sangreal Ceremonies and Rituals (1986). All of these titles were published by Samuel Weiser, Inc., New York. Another great favorite is W. E. Butler’s Magic and the Qabalah (Wellingborough: Aquarian Press, 1964; rpt. New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972). None of these “practical” b ooks draws on Jewish sources; each is based instead on Golden Dawn materials, whether first- or second-hand. One book “presents the majority of the Kabbalistic teachings from the Golden Dawn in one fascinating volume”: Pat Zalewski’s Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1993). This b ook may well reflect Golden Dawn teachings, but it also demonstrates that the longstanding tradition of mangling (Jewish) Kabbalah—and the st ubborn i gnorance of it—has not come to an end. The book’s account of the history and major texts of Kabbalah is studded with a staggering number of errors, betraying Zalewski’s failure to read the sources he lists; even the titles of the books given in the footnotes contain mistakes. As an inexpensive source showing what has become of Cabala, Zalewski’s book may have something to recommend it. However, John Michael Greer’s Paths of Wisdom: Principles and Practice of the Magical Cabala in the Western Tradition (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1996) is a far better, more complete—and certainly more readable—introduction to the Golden Dawn Cabala. Neither as inclusive nor as well presented as Greer’s work is the similar wisdom of Experiencing the Kabbalah by Chic Cicero and Sandra Tabatha Cicero (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1997), which offers the reader and “easy- to-use beginners guide.” Recent interest in the Golden Dawn is demonstrated by a book-sized journal featuring articles by contemporary authors; between 1994 and 1998, four volumes were published ( none since, however). The second volume, The Golden Dawn Journal , Book 2, is subtitled “Qabalah: Theory and Magic,” edited by Chic Cicero and Sandra Tabatha Cicero (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1994).* The articles are spotty; some are downright bad. A few are sincere attempts to offer the results of thoughtful research, both academic and practical. _________ * Given that the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition is the major source of notions and practices for the Golden Dawn, it is no surprise that the subject of “Qabalah” (i.e., Cabala) is also well represented in the other issues of The Golden Dawn Journal : Book I: DIVINATION (1994); Book III: THE ART OF HERMES (1995); and Book IV: THE MAGICAL PANTHEONS (1998; all from Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul). See, for example, Madonna Compton’s article in Book III, “L ogos Revealed: Hermetic Influences on the Renaissance Humanists,” where there is an effort to affect an academic tone in discussions of Pico, Reuchlin, Henry More, and Rosenroth; or Harvey Newstrom’s article in Book IV, “In the Beginning was the Word,” which draws on the Sefer Yezirah and Sefer Bahir —along with The Key of Solomon —in a discussion of the sundry epithets for each of the ten sefirot."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"   34 A checklist of basic readings on the “qabalah” of the Golden Dawn would include 1. Regardie’s edition of Golden Dawn documents, either as The Golden Dawn (most accessible through the Llewellyn reprints) or The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (—somewhat less available than the Llewellyn edition—from New Falcon Press). 2. Dion Fortune’s Mystical Qabalah (reprinted many times). 3. Regardie’s Tree of Life: A Study in Magic (which many occultists and academics rank as one of the best introductions to the whole topic). 4. Gareth Knight’s Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (available through Weiser reprints). 5. Crowley’s 777 (which is included in The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley , reprinted frequently by Weiser). 6. Golden Dawn versions of “qabalistic” texts: a.
