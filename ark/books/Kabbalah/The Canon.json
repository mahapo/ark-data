The demonstration of the above assertion being that in times gone by there were no railways, steamboats, torpedoes, or any of those anaesthetic inventio ns in regard to time and space on which we pride ourselves, and upon which we base our claim to have advanced the general welfare of man - kind.

Science has no marvels; every so - called dis - covery heralded as marvellous (for men of science understand the power of bold advertisement to the full as well as scientists in clog dancing, in hair dress ing, and tightrope walking), is not a marvel in the true meaning of the word. The Röntgen Rays, the microphone, the phono - graph, are all as simple in themselves as is the property of amber rubbed to take up straws. From the beginning there have been Roen tgen Rays, and the principles of microphone and phonograph are coeval with the world. The wonder lies not in the discovery (so - called), but in the fact they have remained so long unknown. The real mystery of mysteries is the mind of man. Why, with a pe n or brush, one man sits down and makes a master - piece, and yet another, with the selfsame instruments and opportunities, turns out a daub or botch, is twenty times more curious than all the musings of the mystics, works of the Rosicrucians, or the mech anical contrivances which seem to - day so fine, and which our children will disdain as clumsy.

Knowledge to - day is not diffused, as writers in newspapers, makers of almanacks, members of school - boards, and worthy men who see the means but cannot grasp the fullness of achievement, are never tired of stating, but on the contrary, goes almost contraband. The fact that all can read and write, cyphe r and scan the columns of a newspaper, can tell the latitude (the longitude more rarely) of Jella Coffee, can prattle innocently of literature, art, spiritualism, and chemistry, can make their per - tinent remarks upon theosophy, discuss religion, say a wor d in season on lithotomy, and generally comport themselves as if their minds were fashioned after the pattern of a kaleidoscope, does not go far to prove the claim of wide extended knowledge. When all write books and few have time to read, when thought gr ows rare and talking never ends, a serious book in which a man has put the labour of his life needs some apology for its appearance. Deal with sex problems (pruriently, of course), be mystic, moral, or immoral, flippant, or best of all be dull, success is sure. Still, in an age of sym - bolism, for everything we see is but a symbol, as kings, queens, dukes, lords, princes, barons, and sandwichmen, it must perforce be interesting to some to read of why the chief symbol of our present faith came to be hel d in veneration. In modern times we use a word, merely to express a thing, and only rarely concern ourselves with the exact value that the word may have."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE. x This may account to some extent for the loose style of many English writers, but to examine into th at would be quite foreign to my purpose. Cer - tain it is that in the ancient world, words and even letters all had their value apart from what we, now - a - days, call meaning. Thus it is that oriental nations, and especially the Jews and Arabs, attach to their particular alphabets not merely a divine origin (for I suppose our alphabet is just as divine as theirs), but a particular sense of sanctity. No one supposes if a better alphabet than that we now employ were to be found that we should still ad - he re from superstitious motives to our own. In the ancient world, apart from letters, every ceremony, each rite, and all the arts and sciences had some peculiar canon which was supposed to govern them. If, in his researches, the author has brought to light some canon which may enlighten architects, and so redeem us from the outrages our builders heap upon us, if he can do even a little to stay the hands of Deans and Chapters from destroying buildings which, by the folly of the nation, have been com - mitted to their care (like sheep to wolves), or put a stop to the restorer, that archfiend, who in con - suming thirst for unity tears down a fine Renais - sance doorway in a Gothic church, and puts up in its stead what he thinks Gothic, his labour will not have bee n lost.

Mu sic and literature, with painting, surgery, and economics, with boxing, fencing, and others of the liberal arts, all have a style fit and peculiar to the times, but architecture yet remains a blot and a disgrace to those who live by it, and to all those w ho use the edifices which it makes, and pay the makers’ bills. But leaving architects bemired in stucco and happy in their “co - operation with the present system,” let us return to the folly of the ancients. Strabo and Celsus, with Diodorus Siculus, Ammianu s Marcellinus, Maimonides, Raimundo Llull, with the Rabbi Jehudah hen Gabirol and others, whose names look well writ large in a quotation, have all remarked upon the symbolism not only of the Cross but of all ancient temples.

To comprehend which it is necessary first to know the Arabians of old times were people very learned in the heavens, and in the phases of the stars . . . made images and statues . . . rings and other things, taking care to do so, at certain times and epochs when the planets and other stars were in a certain posture. And further on he says, “it is re - markable how the Egyptians esteemed the symbol of the cross above all other symbols.” It may be that, as Pedro Mexia says, the Egyptians looked upon the cross as something sacred, because it is “a per fect and most excellent figure geometrically considered.” All things are possible, but a whole people lost in the admiration of a figure for geometric reasons seem improb - able. Geometry is a most admirable science, but appeals little to imagination, and still less to any of the well rooted principles of folly inherent in mankind, which generally impel them to choose a subject to adore. Again Antonio Llobera, in his book called “El Porque de Todas las Ceremonias,” printed at Figueras by Ignacio Porter in 1758 , informs us that “all temples and churches are symbols or figures of the human body . . . the high altar is the head, the transepts are the arms, and the rest of the temple . . . is the body,” so that he knew apparently, that churches were built ac cording to a canon and had assumed the form in which we know them for a special reason.

The author of the present work has not been so deterred, and argues out his case with much pre - cision and a wealth of figures, proving most clearly that the external measurements of almost every ancient temple, the figures of the New Jerusalem, Holy Oblation, and other temples, re al and imagin - ary, reveal the magnitudes of the sun, moon, and other planets, together with the distance of their orbits. And most ingeniously he argues that, as all these calculations were, of necessity, impossible of comprehension to the vulgar, they w ere typified by symbols, the principal of all these symbols being the cross. Therefore it follows, in his opinion, that the rage of the so - called Reformers of the church was not a blind unreasoning fury, blended with a dislike to beauty, but a reasoning f ury against a symbol that they understood. And he remarks, when speak - ing of the Puritans, whom he most justly stigma - tizes as both “ridiculous and ignorant,” that it was curious that, having cast away the cross, they should still retain the Christ, as both are one. We know the mystic letters I.H.S., familiar from our childhood on altar fronts, embroidered in gold thread by pious ladies, were used as symbols of Bacchus, and venerated in his temples by the unreasoning but faithful worshipper just as the y are with us. Thor’s hammer was a cross; the ruins of Palenque bear sculptured on their lintels the mystic symbol, and Bernal Diaz tells us that, in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACE. xiv Cozumel, upon the altars of the temples, crosses were seen deep graven in the stone. Thus it appears tha t almost every nation, every age, has had its Cross, and, if this is the case, what is the reason? The writer of this work most plainly sets it forth, and, in so doing, connects conclusively our symbolism with that which seems inherent in mankind, and ge ntly puts aside all our pretensions to the possession of a faith revealed to us alone. Into these mysteries 1 shrink from entering, but watch him boldly walk amongst the Canon Laws which govern Architecture, Music, Religion, and other things, the laws o f which I take on trust. Unorthodox even in his unorthodoxy, he is sufficiently un - English to be logical and not to shirk, after the English fashion, the just conclusions towards which his reasoning leads. Following his argument, it appears that, in “Th e Abbey” when the nave and aisles are packed with rich and pious Iris de Florence scented worshippers silently waiting for the cir - culating plate, they sit within a building built, like the ancient temples were, to typify the body of a man, and the chief symbol which the Romans held in honour they, too, venerate, when, in their pious contemplation, they lift adoring eyes towards the Cross which stands upon the altar or com - munion table.

T HE failure of all efforts in modern times to dis - cover what constituted the ancient canon of the arts, has made this question one of the most hope - less puzzles which antiquity presents. It is dis - couraging in the extreme to approach the subject at all. The absence of all explicit information from the ancients themselves, combined with the com - plete ignorance of modern authorities, is suffi cient to make one hesitate to lay before the reader any proposition, however plausible, on this obscure sub - ject. It is hoped, however, that the investigation of what appears to be a due to the method practised by the old architects in building the tem ples, may prove of some assistance in eluci - dating the principles, which were the common groundwork of the arts and sciences of the past. For it would appear, that there was an established canonical law underlying the practice of building as well as al l other arts. In a general way this has been felt by all com - petent students of antiquity; and many traces of such an uniformity have been pointed out, but as the root of everything in the old world was"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 2 primarily centred in religion, it is to the ancient theology, that we must look for the foundation and basis of the old canon. The priests were practically the masters of the old world. Everything and everybody was sub - servient to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and no work could be undertaken without its authority. That the priests were legitimately entitled to regulate the building of the temples of the gods, nobody will deny. And that they did exercise this control is beyond dispute. For we find that freemasons, or some body corresponding to th e mediaeval freemasons, with exclusive privileges and secrets required for building the temples, under ecclesiastical authority, have always existed. And the knowledge which we possess of the mediaeval freemasons is sufficient to show that their secret s were the secrets of religion, that is, of mediaeval Christianity. It is these secrets of the old priests, carefully guarded by them, and only communicated to the authorized builders of the temples, that we propose to treat of in the following pages, an d we shall endeavour to show that these secrets, comprising the esoteric doctrine of religion, have been trans - mitted in unbroken continuity, at least from the building of the Great Pyramid, down to recent times. It is, of course, far beyond the scope of this small work, limited to a single object of in - quiry, to enter into a historical examination of the evidences of this continuity of idea, and since there are already in existence books dealing with this special investigation, it is superfluous to und ertake it. It is only necessary to accept the testimony of the old Greek historians, who emphatically assert, that the essential doctrines of the Greek religion were imported into Greece from Egypt. We know that all modem civilization in Europe is of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 3 Greek origin. The Gospel itself is indisputably as much a Greek as a Hebrew creation. It is written in Greek, and was first established among Hellenized peoples, and wherever it was accepted in succeeding generations, it brought with it the ideas of Greece. As there is no reason to doubt the assertions of the Greek historians, as to the indebtedness of their nation to the Egyptians for instruction in the arts and sciences, there has clearly been, through the Greeks, a direct com - munication of Egypt ian ideas to the Hellenized portions of the world, to which we ourselves belong. Just as Pythagoras and Plato, and other Greek philosophers, visited Egypt to study the religion and sciences of that country, so every educated man of a subsequent age stud ied the religion and philosophy of Greece with the same object, namely, to perfect themselves in that knowledge, of which the Greeks were known to have been the re - cipients. To us the Egyptians are only a step further off; but fundamentally the doctrin es which we are now investigating were the same both in Greece and Egypt. How much, the original religion and philosophy of the Egyptians may have been improved by filtering through the refining influence of Greece, must be decided when Egyptologists co me to have a deeper knowledge of Egyptian things, than they have at present. But whatever changes may have been added by Greeks and Christians to the original Egyptian theology, it is insisted, that the central mysteries were accepted by all priests and philosophers, as the only possible basis of religion. And more than that (for we must not always be content with a sensible reason for anything in human affairs) the absolute conservatism, always observed in religious matters, would scarcely admit tha t any"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 4 received doctrine, once established, should be removed. It must be borne in mind, that only the vaguest ideas at present prevail as to the mystical secrets 1 of the old priests. Everybody knows that the Egyptians, Greeks, and other Eastern nations co ncealed the vital doctrines of their theology from the ignorant and vulgar, and it was only by a gradual process of initiation that the meaning of the sacred writings and ceremonies were explained. And then, after this preparation, the initiates were al lowed to be full partakers in the religious rites. It is a misfortune that all the ritual of the older religions has been destroyed, and it is particularly regrettable that no scrap of the sacred writings, or temple ritual of pagan Greece or Rome, has sur - vived to our time. We do not even know whether the Hebraized or Christianized version of the Masonic ritual, as we now know it, has anything more than a faint resemblance to its primitive form. Besides the ordinary services in the pagan temples, it is well known that there were in certain periods especially mysterious celebrations of the nature of dramatic shows or plays, in some cases apparently intended to form the concluding spec - tacle of the initiations. A few ancient authors have alluded to these shows, but when everything is collected from their works, it amounts to very little indeed. Plutarch, St. Clement of Alexandria 1 To avoid misunderstanding, it may be stated here, that throughout the present inquiry the doctrine of the mysteries is assumed to have been a defined s cientific tradition, communi - cated orally to the initiates or mystics, who secretly passed it on from generation to generation. Therefore, mysticism be - ing synonymous with gnosticism, it must not be confounded with the speculative mistiness which is cu ltivated by certain dreamy philosophers of our day. The mystic ( musth j) in the old sense has naturally become extinct, together with the gnosis which formerly instructed him."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 5 (who had been initiated at Eleusis before he be - came a Christian), Lucian, Apuleius, Macrobius and other writers give some slight information, directly or indirectly, on these mystical ceremonies. Besides these, there is a treatise by Jamblichus pretending to expound the whole subject of the mysteries, but this work has been composed with such careful and scrupulous obscurity , that few people have found themselves much the wiser after reading it. There is also the Jewish Cabala, containing an explanation of the priestly secrets and mysteries of the Hebrews, but no one at the present day can fully understand it. There are the works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus preserved by the Neo - Platonists, written in the same philosophical jargon used by Jamblichus and the rest; and there are the references to the doc - trines of the heretical Christians called Gnostics, preserved i n the controversial works of the early fathers. These are some of the most direct sources of information on the mystical doctrines common to the Egyptian, Greek, Hebrew, and Christian religions. But turning from these obscure and fragmentary references, the law of the Hebrew Scriptures and the extensive commentaries of the Talmud, the Gospel with the offices and ritual of the Church, are each an epitome, in its most complete form, of those mysteries for the expounding of which they were severally create d; if these works were clearly understood the difficulty would be cleared up. The deplorable fact, which we have now to regret is, that the priests who ought to be able to tell us the meaning of the Scriptures, which they undertake to expound, know not hing whatever of their real significance. It is probable, that there is not a single Christian priest who knows what the Canon of the Church is, or why a certain office or literary ar -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 6 rangement is canonical or what makes it so. He would deny that the Old Testament and the Gospel are allegorical books, but has no explanation to offer for the absurdities, which occur in these works, if taken literally. In fact, the modern priest, to whom we naturally turn for instruction in the mys - teries of the Church, i s the very last person from whom we are likely to get any information. Let us therefore leave this man, who does not seem to be aware that his office was created that he might receive the canonical tradition from the mouth of a pre - ordained teacher, an d by its light impart the spirit to the letter of the law. We shall assume, that at the building of the Great Pyramid, the first principles of all later theology were already established and fixed, and it would seem, notwithstanding the modern belief to t he contrary, that at that early period the Egypti - ans had arrived at some elementary knowledge of astronomy and cosmography; that they knew the measures of the earth, and the distance of the planets, and had observed the recurrent cycles of the sun and m oon in their several orbits, and many other simple astronomical phenomena; that from these ascertained facts, they derived a scheme em - bodying, in the persons of certain hypothetical gods, a symbolical image of the created universe, and the invisible po wers which regulate it. The deity in this scheme was conceived according to the exact forms manifested in the phenomena of nature. The whole physical and material universe was symbolized by the seven revolving planets and the sphere of the fixed stars , while the agent, or mover, who inspires all bodies with life, was personified by the figure of a man. Thus the phi - losophers constructed a system, which attributed to God a body composed of all the matter of the world, and a soul, which was diffused t hrough all"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 7 its parts. The creed of the philosophers, however, was never openly avowed in the popular religion, but was concealed in the parables of which the old theology was composed. For the old priests never scrupled to believe that history and phil osophy “sufficed but for the chosen few,” while the popu - lace were carefully instigated to the practice of morality by being instructed in that kind of fiction which, in this country, emanates from Exeter Hall. Strabo admirably expresses the attitude of a n educated man to the religion of his day. He says, “The great mass of women and common people cannot be induced by mere force of reason to de - vote themselves to piety, virtue, and honesty; superstition must therefore be employed, and even this is insuff icient without the aid of the marvellous and the terrible. For what are the thunderbolts, the ægis, the trident, the torches, the dragons, the barbed thyrses, the arms of the gods, and all the paraphernalia of antique theology, but fables em - ployed by th e founders of states as bugbears to frighten timorous minds?” (Strabo’s “Geography,” bk. i., ch. ii, § 8 ). 1 Again, the difference between Moses, and Linus, Musæus, Orpheus, and Phe - recydes, is well defined by Origen, who says, that the Greek poets “displ ay little concern for those readers who are to peruse them at once unaided, but have composed their philosophy (as you term it) for those who are unable to comprehend its meta - phorical and allegorical signification . Whereas Moses, like a distinguished ora tor, who meditates some figure of rhetoric, and who carefully intro - duces in every part a language of twofold meaning , has done this in his five books; neither affording, 1 Cicero, who was an Augur as well as an Advocate, did not seem to have taken h is duties very seriously, for he is reported to have said that he could never understand how two Augurs could look each other in the face without laughing."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 8 in the portion which relates to morals, any handle to his Jewish subjects for commi tting evil; nor yet giving to the few individuals who were endowed with greater wisdom, and who were capable of investigating his meaning , a treatise devoid of material for speculation. (Origen “Against Celsus,” bk. i., ch. xviii). That is to say, the H ebrew delivered his fictions in the guise of moral precepts, while the pagan Greeks were not so par - ticular. It is well known to many people that certain numbers had an important place in the philo - sophical and theological system of the ancients. The P ythagoreans concealed their doctrines in a numerical and geometric system, which was the only form of their philosophy given to the outer world. The Jewish priests also elaborated an ex - tensive system of numeration in the Cabala, and the Rabbis frequen tly make use of it in the Tal - mudic commentaries on the Scriptures. The early fathers of the church have preserved considerable expositions of the system in their books con - troverting the heretical opinions of the various sects of Christian Gnostics. B ut the purport of all these theories of numbers has ceased to be understood, together with the greater part of the doctrines of the ancient mysteries of which this numerical philosophy formed a part. The oldest use of numbers as symbols of an esoteric doc trine is to be found in Egypt, from whence it was derived by the Greeks, and trans - mitted by them to the modem world. Although we have, unfortunately, no direct evidence of how the mysterious people of Egypt actually made use of their numbers, it would appear that their numerical system formed a part of the dogma in those laws, referred to by Plato as having been ten thousand years old, and was perpetuated, as one"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 9 of the bases of religion and art by all subsequent peoples. The words of Plato are: “Long ago they appeared to recognize the very principle of which we are now speaking — that their young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue. These they fixed, and exhibited patterns of them in their temples; and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the traditional forms, or invent new ones. To this day no alteration is allowed, either in those arts or in music, at all. And you will find that their works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms t hat they had ten thousand years ago (this is literally true, and no exaggeration), their ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit better, or worse than the work of to - day, but are made with just the same skill.” (“Laws,” 656 . Jowett’s translation , vol. v., p. 226 ). What this canon of art actually was is now unknown, but it is possible to discover the traces of it in the religion and art of the Greeks and Christians. Theology, in its various forms, has always been the epitome of art, and constit uted the law for its guidance. From the times of ancient Egypt this law has been a sacred arcanum, only communicated by symbols and parables, the making of which, in the ancient world, constituted the most important form of literary art; it therefore re quired for its exposition a priestly caste, trained in its use, and the guilds of initiated artists, which existed throughout the world till comparatively recent times, were instructed in it. Now - a - days, all this is changed. Theology has dropped her s ecrets; her symbols have become meaningless ornaments, and her parables are no longer understood. The artist in the service of the Church no longer repre - sents her mysteries in metaphorical shapes, and the priests have as little skill in the old art of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 10 myth - making, as they have in interpreting the Scriptures. Few people have an adequate appreciation of this lost principle — the art, that is, of working symbolically. To us, who have now nothing to conceal, such a practice has naturally gone out of fashion , and the symbol, as a means of concealing rather more than it was intended to explain, has become gradually obsolete. We still write or paint symbolically, but only to make that, which is ob - scure, more plain. In the hands of the old priest, or artist, on the contrary, the symbol was a veil for concealment, beautiful or grotesque, as the case might be. A myth or parable, m their hands, subtly conveyed a hidden truth, by means of a more or less obvious fiction; but it has come to pass, that the crud e and childish lie on its surface is ignorantly believed for the whole truth, instead of being recognized, as the mere clue to its inner meaning. All theology is composed in this way, and her two - fold utterances must be read with a double mind. Thus, w hen we read in the Scrip - tures of the Church, or in the saintly legends, a fiction showing more than ordinary exuberance of fancy, we may be sure, that our attention is being specially arrested. When miraculous events are related of the gods, or when the y are depicted in marvellous shapes, the author gives us to under - stand, that something uncommon is being con - veyed. When singular and unearthly beasts are described, such as Behemoth and Leviathan, the unicorn, or the phœnix, it is intended, that we sh ould search deeply into their meaning: for such are some of the artifices, by which the ancients at once concealed and explained their hidden mysteries. When everything was mystical and metaphorical, it was only natural that numbers should have"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 11 been bro ught to the service of Art. Geometry also provided a symbolical code, which may some day be understood. These geometrical symbols enabled the mathematicians to import the secret mysteries into their works, and also gave to the builders a means of applyin g a numerical system to the temples, which, as Plato says, exhibited the pattern of the laws in Egypt. Considerable traces of this symbolical geometry survive in the arcana of Freemasonry. Most of the practical secrets of the old mediaeval architects , who built the cathedrals according to the mysteries of the church, have perished with the old craft lodges, which preceded the establishment of the modern theo - retical masonry. Nevertheless it is possible to gather out of the early architectural and te chnical books some clue to the old practice of building. All old writers on architecture, as well as free - masons, insist that geometry is the foundation of their art, but their hints as to its application are so obscure, that no one in recent times has b een able to explain how it was used. Philosophy must have been equally dependent upon some system of geometry, for Plato wrote over the door of his academy, “ LET NONE IGNORANT OF GEOMETRY ENTER HE RE ,” and in the “Republic” (bk. vii. 527 ), he says, “You m ust in the utmost possible manner direct the citizens of your beautiful city on no account to fail to apply themselves to GEOMETRY ” — a science which, he says, “flatly con - tradicts the language employed by those who handle it.” From this it may be conclude d, that Plato meant to inform us, that no one could un - derstand his philosophy without knowing the geo - metrical basis of it, since geometry contained the fundamental secret of all the ancient science. It is known both to freemasons and architects, that th e mystical figure called the Vesica Piscis, so"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 12 popular in the Middle Ages, and generally placed as the first proposition of Euclid, was a symbol applied by the masons in planning their temples. Albert Dürer, Serlio, and other architectural writers depict the Vesica in their works, but presumably because an unspeakable mystery attached to it these authors make no reference to it. Thomas Kerrich, a freemason and principal librarian of the University of Cambridge, read a paper upon this mystical figure bef ore the Society of Antiquaries on January 10 th, 1820 . He illustrated his remarks with many diagrams illustrating its use by the ancient masons, and piously concludes by saying, “I would by no means indulge in conjectures as to the reference these figures might possibly have to the most sacred mysteries of religion.” 1 Dr. Oliver, (“Discrep.” p. 109 ) speaking of the Vesica, says, “This mysterious figure Vesica Piscis possessed an unbounded influence on the details of sacred architecture; and it constituted the great and en - during secret of our ancient brethren . The plans of religious buildings were determined by its use; and the proportions of length and height were dependent on it alone.” 2 Mr. Clarkson (In - troductory Essay to Billings’ “Temple Church”) considered that the elementary letters of the primitive language were derived from the same mystical symbol. He says that it was known to Plato and “his masters in the Egyptian colleges,” and was to the old builders “an arche - type of ideal beauty.” The Vesica was also regarded as a baneful object under the name of 1 The west is the feminine end of a Christian church, and the western gables of Gothic cathedrals are often lighted by a rose - window, or one in the shape of the Vesica Piscis, as at Dunblane. 2 See also the article in Gwilt’s “Encyclopædia of Archi - tecture” ( 1876 ), p. 968 ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. 13 the “Evil Eye,” and the charm most generally employed to avert the dread effects of its fascina - tion was the Phallus (J.

It was interchangeable with the Fusill, or Mascle (Guillim’s “Display of Heraldry,” 4 th ed. 1660 , § iv., ch. xix., p. 354 ), and was also figured as a lozenge or rhombus. In the East the Vesica was used as a symbol of the womb, and was joined to the cross by the Egyptians forming the handle of the Crux ansata. Geometrically, the Vesica is constructed from two intersecting circles, so that it may be taken as FIG . 1 . — THE VESICA PISCIS having a doub le significance.

Besides the Vesica Piscis the old philosophers and freemasons were accustomed to use as sym - bo ls all the plane geometrical figures.

The Hexagon was the common symbol of the Masonic Cube or Cubical Stone, while the Triangle, and Square had each their use as geometrical symbols. The Cross has also been from the remotest times a potent mystical emblem among all ancie nt peoples. Crosses were generally of three kinds, the Tau Cross, the upright or Jerusalem Cross, and the Saltire or diagonal Cross, and each had its peculiar significance.

This number 1,480 , as will be shown further on, accurately exhibits an important measure of the Cosmos, and was, apparently, chosen to be the foundation of the scientific pantheism upon whic h the Christian theology is built, and was a part of the Gnosis, primarily derived from those laws of the priestly astronomers of ancient Egypt, who first devised the canon, which became a fundamental principle in the Greek, Jewish, and Christian Law. But there is no apparent evidence, that the Jews and Christians possessed a sufficiently exact know - ledge of the Cosmic scheme, to introduce any of its dimensions into the names of the Deity. And so it would appear.

T HE publication by Copernicus of the measures of the universe, which are at once straightforward and accurate, was coincident with the Reformation, and the breaking - up of the old mysticism of the Middle Ages. His scheme was printed in 1543 in his celebrated work, “De Revolutionibus Or - bium Coelestium,” the first copy of which was placed in his hands a few hours before his death; but t he Pythagorean doctrine of the diurnal motion of the earth, and its revolution round the sun, was taught by him during his life, and received a con - siderable amount of attention at the beginning of the sixteenth century. In the above work, according to Newcomb (“Pop. Astron.,” p. 60 ), the relative distances of the planets are recorded with fair accuracy, the unit of measurement employed being the interval of the earth's distance from the sun. The measures are: According to Copernicus: According to Newc omb: # 0.326 0.308 $ 0.709 0.718 , 1.000 1.000 % 1.373 1.328 & 5.453 5.454 ' 9.760 10.070"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 17 The moon’s distance he computed at 60 1 / 3 semi - diameters of the earth. At this time it was a dangerous innovation to publish any but the vaguest astronomi cal facts, and as Copernicus had some anxiety as to how his statement would be received, his friend Rhe - ticus published a volume, giving a preliminary account of the Copernican theory. Although the Papal authorities did not like the work of Coper - nicus , it only received their qualified disapprobation, for they put it on the index “subject to correction.” However, although Copernicus stands as the first of the modern astronomers, he wrote very much in the same mystical strain as his predecessors, and was by no means like an astronomer of the ninet - eenth century. What he really appears to have done was to establish a precedent for the open publication of genuine observations, which even the gentle discouragement of the inquisitors was unable to suppr ess. Whether the measures of the planetary system, which he published, were de - rived from his own observations, or were only the revelation of an existing tradition, it is difficult to determine. But as he is said to have died with - out ever seeing his p lanet Mercury, presumably he could have made no observations as to the dis - tances of this planet, and consequently must have received his data from some one else. This would imply that the astronomers before his time knew the distances of the other plane ts, as well as that of Mercury. Again, if it were possible for Coper - nicus to arrive at the correct proportions of the universe without a telescope, and unaided by any previous observations beyond those which were published, we can see no reason for disb elieving, that the ancients, who are alleged to have gazed at the stars for thousands of years, were incapable of coming to a similarly accurate conclusion."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 18 In the next century the fact, that the diameter of the earth's orbit round the sum is 220 diamete rs of the sun, is, so far as we know, mentioned for the first time — a statement which implies a true know - ledge of the earth’s magnitude. This statement is to be found in Galileo’s “System of the World,” the work which was condemned by the Inquisitors, a nd for the publication of which he was arraigned, and prohibited from continuing his astronomical researches, or at least from publishing them. The passage in which the measurement of the sun’s distance is given, is such as to make it doubtful if the calc ulation were made at that time. The con - text is as follows: — “I suppose with the said Copernicus, and also with his opposers, that the semi - diameter of the grand orb, which is the dis - tance of the earth from the sun, containeth 1,208 semi - diameters of the said earth. Secondly, I premise with the allowance aforesaid, and of truth, that the apparent diameter of the sun, in its mean distance, to be about half a degree, that is 30 min . prim , which are 1,800 seconds, that is, 108,000 thirds. And because the a pparent diameter of a fixed star of the first magnitude is no more than 5 seconds, that is, 300 thirds, and the diameter of a fixed star of the sixth magnitude, 50 thirds (and herein is the greatest error of the anti - Coper - nicans), therefore the diameter of the sun con - taineth the diameter of a fixed star of the sixth magnitude 2,160 times . . . “The diameter of the sun is 11 semi - diameters of the earth, and the diameter of the grand orb contains 2,146 of these same semi - diameters, by the assent of bo th parties; so that, the diameter of the said orb contains the sun’s diameter 220 times very near. And because the spheres are to one another as the cubes of their diameters, let us make the cube of 220 , which"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 19 is 106,480,000 , and we shall have the grand orb 106,480,000 times bigger than the sun, to which grand orb a star of the sixth magnitude ought to be equal, according to the assertion of this author. “The error, then, of these men consisteth in being extremely mistaken, in taking the apparent diam eter of the fixed stars.” (Salusbury’s Trans - lation, tom. i., p. 325 .) The first assumption in this remarkable passage, namely, the distance from the earth to the sun called the grand orb, is enormously deficient. The distance according to modern calcu lations is 959 3 000 404 91 , , , = 23,086 semi - diameters at the least, or about 10 times the number stated in the text, that is, if Galileo had given the number at 12,000 instead of 1,200 ( 12,080 ), it would have been approximately correct. Again, the d iameter of the sun is nearly 110 diameters of the earth, not 11 semi - diameters, as stated. Whether, in face of this error, it was possible to compute the earth’s distance correctly by diameters of the sun, is a question for astronomers to decide. It see ms most extraordinary, that, holding such erroneous con - ceptions of the magnitude both of the earth and the sun, he should yet bring out the correct result in his final calculation of their distance, measured by the diameter of the sun. It is also curi ous, that by multiplying the two numbers 1,208 and 11 by 10 we get a real dimension of the sun’s diameter and distance. It is true that we have to take the last in diameters instead of semi - diameters to make it right. But, if the whole thing is a mys tification, this would be quite sufficient for the purpose, and make detection more difficult.

It is tolerably certain, from what we know of Galileo’s stated opinions, that if there had been no censorship he would have published his work in a more direct form, notwithstanding his obliging complacence to the wishes of the priests, when they used their Procrustean persuasion to make him change his mind, and take their view as to how astronomical matters ought to be announced to the wo rld. His non - resistance on this occasion, as well as the obscure and mystical language in which his four tedious dialogues are written, rather favours the idea, that his views differed very little from those of the Inquisitors after all. This tribunal merely disliked the idea of accurate astro - nomical knowledge becoming common property, and Galileo showed no serious objection to gratify them. Kepler and Tycho Brahe, the contempo - raries of Galileo, always kept their disclosures within the bounds of e cclesiastical license, and Kepler never pretended that he spoke otherwise than in parables in his “Mysterium Cosmo - graphicum” — an obviously mystical work, written entirely as an exposition of the old doctrines which we find in the “Timæus” of Plato. All th ese mystifications resorted to by the astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen - turies suggest, that there was no real desire on their part to allow the true facts of their science to become generally known, and a sentence of John Hutchinson’s impl ies, that there was nothing new in the disclosures of Copernicus. For he says: “Such as believe that the motions of the orbs were never known before Copernicus, nor philosophy before, or that it was understood by Sir Isaac Newton, let them study their b ooks.” 1 Again, the 1 “The Religion of Satan, or Antichrist delineated,” 1749 ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 21 assertion, which is so frequently made, that Galileo was the first astronomer who used a telescope, is unsubstantiated by any certain evidence. From a passage in the “Clouds” of Aristophanes we know that the Greeks used burning glasse s, and consequently must have known their magnifying powers. Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century alludes to his use of a telescope and microscope. Cornelius Agrippa (“Vanity of the Arts and Sciences”) alludes to experiments with hollow, convex, and oth er glasses, which make little things appear great, and things afar off near. J. B. Porta ( 1598 ) also makes a similar statement: “Con - cave lenses show distant objects more clearly, convex those which are nearer, whence they may be used to assist the sight . . . . If you know rightly how to combine one of each sort, you will see both far and near objects larger and clearer. . . .

The accusers of Galileo called him plagiarist, liar, and i mpostor, as well as heretic, so his “Invention” may have been merely the disclosure of what everybody up to his time had concealed.

Since so much uncertainty exists as to the origin of exact astronomical observations, and consider - ing that the ancients devoted such extraordinary attention to the heavenly bodies, it is reasonable to suppose that the Egyptians and Chaldæans, who are said to have observed the stars for countless generations, must have arrived at something more than a vague and absurdly inadequate know - ledge of a science to which they had been so long addicted. It is incredible that their know ledge of the magnitude of the planetary system should have been so erroneous as we are generally ex - pected to believe. The fact appears to be, that this science was a part of the hidden doctrine of the mysteries, and was consequently withheld from t he uninitiated. The practice of astronomy among the Egyptians is repeatedly alluded to by Herodotus, Diodorus, and all early authorities. Strabo saw at Heliopolis “The houses of the priests and the residences of Plato and Eudoxus . . . Eudoxus came her e with Plato, and accord - ing to some writers, lived thirteen years in the society of the priests, for the latter were distin - guished by their knowledge of the heavenly bodies, but were mysterious and uncommunicative, yet after a time they were prevailed upon by courtesy to acquaint them with some of the principles of their science, but the barbarians concealed the greater part of them.” He says further, that the later Greek astronomers derived much knowledge from the records of the priests and the C haldeans.

Sir Isaac Newton, for instance, who was not likely to be deceived in astronomical matters, deduces the date of the Argonautic Expedition from the sphere of Musæus (“Chron.,” pp. 82 , 95 ). He entirely accepts the reality of this primitive sphere, con - structed by a mythical person, the master of Orpheus, and further proves his date from the observations of Thales, Meton, and Hipparchus. To Sir Isaac Newton this story of the Argonauts is quite real, as regard s the astronomy, and is apparently regarded by him as the ordinary mytho - logical manner of recording a date. He never questions its accuracy beyond saying that the observations of the ancients were coarse. That this is the true attitude to be taken towa rds such early writings we have no doubt, and until these are systematically read with a view of ascertaining their hidden meaning, all ancient history must remain as at present a grotesque absurdity. The Christians, from the outset of their exist - ence, seem to have deliberately destroyed all the early works on astronomy. The New Sect had no doubt the same reason for this course of action as for the persecution of astronomers in later times. Nevertheless, out of the fragments of the classical writers , we get some idea of what was known in their time. The following passage from Strabo (bk. ii., ch. v.) gives some notion of what he knew, or rather what he cared to tell on this sub - ject: “The earth and heaven are spheroidal. The tendency of all bodi es having weight, is to a centre. Further, the earth, being spheroidal, and having the same centre as the heavens, is motion - less as well as the axis, which passes through both it and the heavens. The heavens turn round both"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 24 the earth, and its axis fro m east to west. . . . While the planets, the sun, and the moon describe certain oblique circles comprehended within the Zodiac. Admitting these points in whole or in part, astronomers proceed to treat of other matters [such as] the motions [of the stars] , their revolu - tions, eclipses, size, relative distance, and a thou - sand similar particulars. . . . The heavens and the earth must be supposed to be divided each into five zones, the celestial zone to possess the sane names as those below. . . . These z ones may be distinguished by circles drawn parallel to the equator on either side of it. Two of these will separate the torrid from the temperate zones, and the remaining two the temperate from the frigid. . . . Likewise the torrid zone, which is divid ed into two halves by the equator, is distinguished as having a northern and southern side.” In a general way, this is substantially what a modern astronomer would tell us, with the excep - tion that in the old system the earth took the place of the s un, and it is noticeable, that Strabo says, that it is the business of an astronomer to ascertain the size and relative distances of the heavenly bodies. Several ancient computations of the measures of the universe, claiming to be accurate, have survived to our time. Such as the distances of the planetary orbits recorded by Ptolemy, and the calculation of the earth’s circumference made by Eratosthenes. Ptolemy’s measurements are very obviously wrong, and curiously enough this seems to be well known to Hippolytus, who, after quoting the figures, thus concludes an ironical passage: “Oh pride of vain - toiling soul, and incredible belief, that Ptolemy should be considered pre - eminently wise among those who have cultivated similar wisdom” (“Refutation of all Heresies,”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 25 bk. iv., c. xii.). Eratosthenes gives the earth’s circumference at 250,000 stadia; but it is impos - sible to decide whether this was a true estimate, since we have no positive information as to the value of the stadium he used. He made his observations in Egypt, and arrived at his result according to the methods practised at the present day. He had the advantage of using the astro - nomical appliances anciently established at Alex - andria, and as librarian to the great library he had access to all the available astronomical know - ledge of the Egyptians. He was, moreover, in every way qualified for the task, so that it must be almost a certainty that his calculation was sub - stantially correct. Little or nothing being now known about the Ale xandrian standard measures, speculations based upon any hypothetical value of the stadium of Eratosthenes can only lead to doubtful results. Nevertheless it is not an un - reasonable supposition that the Egyptians and Greeks had accurately computed the me asure - ments of the earth. To discover the precise knowledge of the ancients as to the measures of the universe, it is first necessary to determine the standards of measurement which were generally in use. Un - fortunately our ignorance on this essential point makes all inquiries on the subject extremely hazardous and difficult. If the British standard measure of length be examined, it would appear that the division of its component parts has been derived from the ascertained diameter of the earth. It is well known that the modern French standard constructed in the last century, was deduced from a fraction of the earth's circumference, possibly in accordance with a more ancient precedent. The antiquity of our English standard is unknown, there being apparently no allusion to it before the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 26 time of Elizabeth. The Druids were credited by Julius Caesar, and other writers, with a consider - able knowledge of astronomy, and must conse - quently have possessed a set of measures, but whether the original Britis h standard of the Druids was preserved during the Roman and subsequent invasions, and is that which now survives, is un - certain. In any case the following coincidences may be pointed out, and need not be regarded as being purely accidental. The number o f British miles in the mean diameter of the earth is in round numbers 7,920 . The polar diameter is 7,899 , and the equatorial diameter is 7,926 , giving 7,918 as the exact mean. But 7,920 , being a more con - venient number, may be accepted as the reputed amount. Now the British furlong contains 7,920 inches. It also contains 220 yards and 110 fathoms, which are respectively the diameter and radius of the earth’s orbit measured by the diameter of the sun. A mile contains 1,760 yards, and an equilateral tr iangle, inscribed within in the orbit of Saturn measured by the diameter of the sun, measures about 1,760 diameters on each of its sides. Therefore the British standard records three important measures of the cosmic system. Assuming that these coincid ences are the result, not of accident but of design, we are led to the conclusion that at some time, possibly very remote, the dimensions of the cosmos were ascertained, and introduced into the standard measures in - herited by the English people. Anothe r coincid - ence, lately discovered, is that the English quarter measure is exactly a quarter of the capacity of the coffer of the Great Pyramid, which suggests a connection between our measures and those of the builders of Egypt. There are other reasons for supposing that this coincidence between the English standard and that of the Great Pyramid"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 27 is not accidental, but these must be discussed further on. For the present the reader must be asked to assume that a standard measure, corresponding to tha t in use in England, was known to the Egyptians, Hebrews, and Greeks, and was mystically employed to register the facts of astronomy in the several scriptures of these peoples. The first measures are said to have been derived from the body of a man, “ac cording to the simili - tude whereof God formed the world . . . in such sort, that the one is called the greater world, and the other the lesser” (Lomazzo on “Painting,” p. 109 ). Therefore man having been made in the image both of God and the world, God , the world, and man are synonymous terms, and the human body becomes the standard measure of the world. According to Vitruvius a man’s height is four cubits = 6 feet = 24 palms = 96 digits. Now, taking the earth's distance from the sun at 10 , the rad ius of the sphere of the zodiac becomes about 96 , so that the number of digits in a man’s height may have been supposed to measure the seven orbits of the planets, surrounded by the fixed stars. In that case, when Vitruvius lays it down that all temples are to be designed according to the pro - portions of the human body, he may mean that the temples were to conform to the measures of the universe. The astronomical science of the Hebrews seems to be mystically concealed under the figures of Noah’s ark, the Tabernacle, the Temple of Solo - mon, and the Holy Oblation of Ezekiel, while the Christians added to these the mystical city of the New Jerusalem, described in the two last chapters of the Revelation. Each of these mystical struc - tures appears to exhibi t a particular aspect of the heavens, and constitutes a scientific record of cer -"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 28 tain known facts of astronomy, which formed the true basis of the ancient theology. The cosmos of the Christians, according to late writers, but presumably derived from the t radition of the ancient church, consisted of three principal divisions: First, there were the three FIG . 2 — CONVENTIONAL PLAN OF THE UNIVERSE HAVING THE SEVEN ORBITS OF THE PLANETS INSTEAD OF T HE SEVEN INTERVALS GENERALLY SHOWN ON THE OLD DIA GRAMS . circ les of the empyreum; secondly, the sphere of the fixed stars, together with the seven planets; and, lastly, the sublunary, or elementary world. In Greek the names of the three divisions of the universe are EMPYREION , AITHER , and STOICHEIA , whose numer ical values, as will be seen, correctly set forth the measures of the system for which they"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 29 stand. This scheme appears in many of the illustrated works of the sixteenth and seven - teenth centuries, but the intervals between the orbits of the planets are never correctly drawn. To make a diagram accurately showing the relative distances of the seven planetary orbits, it will be found that the sun’s diameter, the interval between the earth and the moon, called the Tone by Pliny, or the earth’s diameter , are convenient units of measurement. All these units, as well as the British mile, appear to have been employed by the ancients. If the orbits of the planets are measured by the length of the sun's diameter, taken at 852,584 British miles, the dist ances are: Diam. of the sun: From the sun to # 35,392,638 miles 41 ½ ,, ,, $ 66,131,476 ,, 77 ½ ,, ,, , 92,500,000 ,, 108 ½ ,, ,, % 139,312,226 ,, 163 ½ ,, ,, & 475,693,149 ,, 558 ,, ,, ' 872,134,583 ,, 1,023 According to the old Egyptian system, the earth stood in the centre, the sun was supposed to occupy the earth’s orbit, while Mercury and Venus revolved round the sun as satellites. Even modern astronomers, with all their appliances, are uncer - tain as to the exact distance of the earth from the sun. It has been computed to be from 108 to 110 of its own diameters. Galileo called it 110 , and the ancients seem to have usually taken it at this amount. Origen (“Against Celsus,” bk. Vi., Ch. 23 ), after describing the cosmic ladder of the Mithraic mysteries, and the harmonic arrangements of the stars, continues: “If one wished to obtain means for a profounder contemplation of the entrance of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 30 souls into divine things . . . . let him peruse at the end of Ezekiel's prophecies the visions . . . . and let him peruse also from the Apocalypse of John what is related of the city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and of its foundations and gates.

The city of Jerusalem is there de - scribed as being surrounded by a four - square figure, called the Holy Oblation, which is said to be 25, 000 reeds on every side. The suburbs of the city are enclosed by a square whose sides are 5,000 reeds, and the city in the middle measures 4,500 reeds on every side. Beyond the suburbs on the north and south a space of 25,000 × 10,000 reeds was allotted to the priests and Levites. Now, if the sides of the three squares be divided by 12 — the number of the tribes — ( 12 000 25 , = 2,083 1 / 3 , 12 000 5 , = 416 2 / 3 , and 12 500 4 , = 375 ) , it will be found that the city exactly contains the sun’s orbit, together with the orbit of Venus, shown in the four quarters according to the Egyp - tian system, and probably represents the wheels of the four living creatures, seen in the first vision of Ezekiel . The orbit of Saturn, being about 2,046 diameters of the sun, is contained within the outer square, whose sides are 2,083 1 / 3 . The square sur - rounding the suburbs of the city has no direct affinity with the orbits of the planets, but a circle whose area is equal to this square has a circum - ference of 1,480 . For various reasons it would seem that the measure 2,083 1 / 3 is a mean between the numbers 2,093 and 2,073 . Let it therefore be taken for granted that the Holy Oblation is a square enclosed by two lines, which are repre - sented by the mean dimension 2,083 1 / 3 . The outer line, which measures 2,093 , is the side of a square having an area double that, which has a side of 1 This last sentence is a very good specimen of Patristic equivocation."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 32 1,480 . That is to say, a circle inscribed within the square 2,093 exactly conta ins a square whose sides are 1,480 ; and this circle will be assumed to be the sphere of the zodiac or firmament. The side of the inner square, again, measuring 2,073 , is 1 / 1 2 th of the earth's circumference measured in miles. The numerical value of th e name CHRISTOS is 1,480 , and the mystery of this number appears to be that it supplies the measure of God’s body extending crosswise throughout the whole universe. The wisdom of the number 666 conveys the same theological secret, for 666 is the diamete r of a circle having a circumference of 2,093 . The Greeks appear to have concealed a similar knowledge in the names of the planets, as recorded in the Epinomis of Plato, who calls the five planets CRONOS , 1,090 , ZEUS , 612 , 'ARES , 309 , 'AFRODITH , 993 , and `ERMHS , 353 ; if the sun, `HLIOS , 318 , and the moon, SELHNH , 301 , be included, the sum of the numbers obtained from the seven names is 3,976 , a number which is one less than the radius of a circle 25,000 in circumference. Now the side of the Holy Oblati on, according to Ezekiel, is 25,000 reeds ( 12 000 25 , = 2,083 1 / 3 ) . But a far more striking coincidence arises from the addition of the numbers deduced from the names EMPUREION , 760 , AIQHR , 128 , and STOICEIA , 1,196 , for the sum of these amount s to 2,084 , or the mean length of the side of the Holy Oblation. In the same way the geometrical figure called the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse will be found to contain the sun's orbit and that of Mercury. Francis Potter, who published a book on “ the number 666 ” in 1647 , alludes to the mys - teries of this celestial city. He tell us, that the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 33 144 cubits ascribed to the wall are to be taken as the area of its section — the wall being 12 cubits high and 12 cubits broad. The other measure - ment given is that in ch. xxi., v. 16 : “And the city lieth four square, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed 12,000 furlongs. The length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.” Francis Potter explains that the 12,000 furlongs ( st£dia ) are to be taken as the contents of a cube, but his calcu - lations as to its size are obscure. However 12,000 furlongs = 7,920,000 feet ( 12,000 × 660 = 7,920,000 ), and the cube root of this number is about 199 1 / 3 , or roughly 2 00 , which gives the length of one side of the cube. The area of the city is therefore a square nearly 200 feet on every side, surrounded by a wall 12 cubits, or 18 feet wide, which increases the outside dimensions to 235 1 / 3 feet. This figure appears t o be a Christian variation of the Hebrew city of Ezekiel, and so it is interpreted by Francis Potter. For it will be found, that it incloses the sun’s orbit together with that of Mercury, drawn in each of the four corners of the square. It is well know n that the four beasts, which appear in the midst of the four wheels in Ezekiel's vision, are iden - tical with the four symbols of the Evangelists, and the devices upon the four standards of the Camp of the Israelites, where they stand for the four corner signs of the Zodiac — Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. In a thirteenth century manuscript of the Apocalypse in the British Museum (MSS. Add. 18,633 ), there is a miniature of the city of the New Jerusalem, showing the three persons of the Trinity, in the midst of a square having the four symbols of the Evangelists depicted in the four corners, cor=responding to the four orbits of Mercury. This peculiar arrangement constantly recurs in early Christian art. Usually the Christ is surrounded"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 34 by the Vesica, and it is a remarkable fact, that a Vesica, whose length is equal to that of the city in the preceding diagram, coincides with the four circles of Mercury's orbit, and consequently pro - duces a geometrical figure exactly resembling the common method of rep resenting Christ in Glory. The circumferences of the two circles which form the Vesica being nearly 360 , they may be taken to represent the two intersecting circles of the equator and the ecliptic. Some interpreters, according to Francis Potter, take th e 12,000 furlongs to be the area of the city, and therefore he says, “that the FIG . 4 – THE NEW JERUSALEM perimeter or compass of such an area must be 436 furlongs at the least,” the side being about 109 furlongs. And s ince 109 is roughly the radius of the sun's orbit measured by the sun's diameter the New Jerusalem is doubly shadowed forth as a vision of the city of the Sun. In ch. xxi., v. 9, “that great city, the holy Jerusalem descending out of Heaven” is called “ the Bride the Lamb’s wife, and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.” The bride of the Cabala was called ADNI or THORA , and it is evidently she whom St. John is describing under the figure of the heave nly city. The name Tarot has been derived from the Hebrew word THORA , the law; and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 35 it is a further confirmation of the cosmic import of this diagram that the hieroglyph of the twenty - second card of the Tarot - pack, called “Le Monde,” represents the four s ymbols of the Evangelists surrounding a Vesica, inclosing the figure of a young virgin. Moreover the circle which surrounds the city has a circumference of 888 , the numerical value of the name Jesus. Again, Francis Potter constantly connects the New Jeru salem with the number 666 , and this may be explained by the fact that its diagonals measure ( 333 × 2 =) 666 , and the cross thus formed symbolized what he calls the Antichrist. If the inferences just drawn from the numbers ascribed to the Holy Oblation an d the New Jeru - salem be correct, it is obvious that these diagrams afford a positive evidence of the knowledge pos - sessed by the Hebrews and Christians concerning the magnitude and distances of the heavenly bodies. The position of these figures in the C anonical Scriptures also conclusively demonstrates a connection between theology and cosmic science. For while the extent of the ancient knowledge of astronomy has still to be proved, no one can rea - sonably doubt that the old theological systems were larg ely concerned with, if not actually founded upon, the order of the universe, which in its en - tirety supplies the only comprehensible manifesta - tion of the Deity evident to the senses of man - kind. In the statement of Origen, already quoted, he refers to the Camp, as well as the Holy Oblation, and hints that a similar interpretation applies to both. The description, of which he speaks, occurs in the second chapter of Numbers, where it is said that the Israelites pitched their camp round the Tabernacle . They were grouped in four companies composed of three tribes, each under a"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 36 standard. The standard of Judah was set at the east, that of Reuben at the south, that of Ephraim at the west, and that of Dan at the north. Judah’s standard bore a lion, Reub en’s bore a mandrake, Ephraim’s a bull, and Dan’s a serpent. The total number of the whole army distributed under the standards was 603,550 (v. 32 ). Villalpanda (“In Ezek.” vol. ii., p. 470 ) gives a diagram of the camp (reproduced by Kircher “Œdip.” to m. ii., pars 1 , p. 21 , and Sir W. Drummond, “Œdipus Judaicus,” plate 15 ) in the form of a square, with the signs of the zodiac arranged round it, three on every side. Each of the twelve tribes is identified with one of the signs, and the standards are a llotted to the four tribes which occupy the corners of the square, whose corresponding signs are Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio. The four corner signs of the Zodiac were afterwards assigned as the symbols of the four evangelists, beginning with Aquar ius (Matthew), Leo (Mark), Taurus (Luke), and Scorpio, changed to an eagle (John). Villalpanda’s diagram con - tains, besides the Zodiac, the symbols of the seven planets and four elements, thus comprising the whole cosmic system which has been supposed to be included in the Holy Oblation. The arrange - ment of the squares in which the symbols are placed suggests that if the solution of the mystery is a geometrical one, it depends upon the problem of squaring the circle. For the old method of findi ng the diameter of a circle whose area was equal to a given square was to divide the diagonal of the square into ten parts, and to take eight for the diameter of the circle. The division of the camp in Villalpanda's diagram is into ten equal squares, t he space between each of the squares bearing the symbol of the Zodiac upon it, being a double square. Therefore, a circle touching the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE HOLY OBLATION. 37 inner angle of the four corner signs has an area equal to the area of the camp. Now, by dividing 603.550 the number o f the Israelites, by 12 , we get 50,295 5 / 6 , which is nearly equal to the length of the two diagonals of the square, whose area is FIG . 5. — THE CAMP OF THE ISRA ELITES ( VILLALPANDA , “ IN EZEK . EXPLANATIONES ,” 1596 , TOM . II ., P . 470 ) half of that of the Ho ly Oblation. The diagonal of this square being ( 2 295 50 , = ) 25,147 1 / 2 , and taking, as in the case of the Holy Oblation, 1 / 1 2 of this number to be the length required, we get 12 147 25 , = 2,095 7 / 1 2 , or very nearly the diagona l of a square whose sides are 1,480 . The diagonal of such a square is about 2,093 , which has been suggested as the extreme measure of the Holy"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 38 Oblation. Now a circle having an area equal to that of a square whose sides are 1,480 , and whose diagonal is 2,093 , has a diameter of 1,674 ( 10 093 2 , = 209 3 / 1 0 × 8 = 1,674 2 / 5 ). And the square inclosing this circle has a diagonal of 2,368 , which is the numerical equivalent of the name IESOVS CHRISTOS ( 888 + 1,480 = 2,368 ). A simpler explanation is that the square root of 603,550 is 776 8 / 9 , and this number is th e perimeter of the Holy Oblation if the sun's distance be taken at 10 . If this be the true interpretation of the numbers, the representation of the camp given by Villal - panda exactly agrees with the result. For the square 1,480 being inscribed within th e sphere of the Zodiac the arrangement of the signs as the border of the square appropriately notifies that fact, and the addition of the seven planets and the four elements makes the diagram a conventional picture of the three divisions of the universe which correspond to the three persons of the cabalistic triad symbolized by the numbers 2,368 , 1,480 , and 888 . These are the three great canonical numbers of antiquity, and they are exemplified by the three mystical diagrams just described. The camp ma y be said to symbolize the number 2,368 ( IESOVS CHRISTOS ), the Holy Oblation may be referred to the number 1,480 , CHRISTOS , and the Heavenly City of the Bride, being inclosed in a circle 888 in circumference, may be accepted as the symbol of the number 888 ( IESOVS ). Generally the third person of the Trinity represented the sublunary world or four elements only, but in the Pythagorean system she also personified the sun, whose orbit, as has been shown, is contained in her city de - scribed by St. John."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"39 CHAPTER III THE CABALA. “ The Jews, in imitation of the Pythagorean Institutes, made the Cabala their codex or Canon Law .” — “Court of the Gen - tiles,” vol. iii., p. 216 . “ The Church of Rome persisted obstinately in affirming, though not always with the same imprudence and plainness of speech, that the Holy Scriptures were not composed for the use of the multitude, but only for that of their spiritual teachers .” — M OS - HEIM , “Eccl. Hist.,” vol. ii., sect. iii., ch. i., p. 25 . I N order that what follows may be b etter under - stood, we must now attempt to elucidate the principal doctrines of the Cabala. This singular work is known to have formed an important part of the Masonic traditions, and undoubtedly con - tains the nearest approach to a direct revelation o f the ancient canonical secrets of the old world; and however obscure it may be, those parts which are intelligible provide us with a few fundamental facts, which are indisputably the basis of the old esoteric philosophy. The books of the Cabala which have come down to us are said to have been first written by Simeon Ben Jochai at the time of the destruction of the second temple, and afterwards expanded by his disciples. Mr. Mathers, in the introduction to his translation of the “Zohar,” tells us t hat the mysterious science of the Cabala was said to have been communicated by angels to Adam after his fall. From Adam it passed to Noah and the Patriarchs. “Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 40 was first initiated into the Cabal a in the land of his birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness, where he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole forty years, but received lessons in it from one of the angels.” Although statements o f this kind are merely philosophic fictions, we may safely accept the antiquity of the Cabala as being very great. The legends of its origin are not made without a purpose, for underneath their fictit - ious terms a truth is concealed. For instance, t he communication of the Cabala was said to be coeval with the Fall, because this event, allegoric - ally understood, symbolizes the transmission of the mystical doctrine as an emblem of the divine essence or life existing in the universe. The Cabala was t he emblem of the soul of the world, and, as all human art was created in the imitation of nature, the secret tradition symbolized the in - visible soul, which inspired the letter of the Scrip - tures. And since it was a postulate of the philo - sophers, that the tradition or passage of the spirit or soul of God from heaven to earth was effected through the Zodiac and seven planets, so they alleged that the Cabala was transmitted through the mouths of the Patriarchs and the Messiah Christos, who personified the planetary system. According to the old cosmic arrangement, the universe consisted of three stages, the Empyreum, the seven planets, and the earth in the centre. This order we may call God, the Universe, and Man, and the cabalistic steps or degrees, embracing these three divisions, may be said to express the hypothetical agency through which the spirit flowed down to earth, and was first incarnated in the human body of the hypothetical creature, Adam. The cabalistic theology, representing the endless reasoning of countless generations of ingenious"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 41 men, is the epitome of man's first efforts to grasp the problems connected with the cause and con - tinuance of life, the inscrutable mystery which has baffled the understanding of all inquirers alike. They reasoned concerning all the phenomena of existence by their analogy to human creation, and it was supposed that the universal creation took place after the manner of human creation, and that the generative attributes of a man and a woman were those of God and the universe, and finally that all the bodily functions of a human being had their counterpart in the macrocosm or greater world. The theoretical system based upon these ideas constituted the secret doctrine, which was taught orally, and was neve r written. All the old canonical writings are an exposition of its teach - ing, but these works are composed, so that only those persons, who are instructed in the rules of the hidden wisdom could discover their meaning. There was a mystical doctrine t aught in all the old schools of philosophy. In the case of the Pytha - goreans, a long and severe period of probation was required on the part of an aspirant, before the ultimate truths of the system were communicated. Although the true interpretation of the Jewish law depends upon a knowledge of these cabalistic mysteries, it is possible, that not a single human being at the present day understands their mean - ing or application. Menasseh Ben Israel, a Jewish writer at the beginning of the seventeenth ce ntury, has recorded some valuable observations on this mystical science, and has given the thirteen rules for practical use in interpreting the myths of the prophets. He says, “God delivered to Moses the written law, and the commentary called the oral l aw; the latter was to be retained mentally and to be transmitted by tradition; it is therefore"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 42 termed ‘Cabala’ (received). Accordingly the two texts (Exodus, xxxiv. 27) are presumed to allude to the two laws, so denominated from one being an exposition of the other. . . . “All the known languages of the world, except - ing the Hebrew only, owe their origin to human construction and art; but the Hebrew had the Lord for its author and framer, and is thence called the ‘holy tongue,’ as it proceeded from that consummate Wisdom, which is infinite; each word in itself contains the profoundest mysteries . . . . for which reason R. Simeon Ben Jochai says in the ‘Zohar,’ ‘ Woe to him who imagines that the Law only contains the superficial structure of it s narration . . . .’ ‘and he, who supposes it has no soul comprised within its veiled mysteries, has no portion in the world to come.’ ‘Its body only,’ he continues, ‘the ignorant enjoy, but sages, who are the gifted servants of the Sublime and Most High King, look to its soul as its superior portion, and others still more learned to the soul of that soul. . . .’ “The least instructed are those who . . . . occupy themselves in the endeavour to learn how things happen according to the literal r ecord; these are rewarded for their pious application (although they do not properly understand it) yet acquire salvation by virtue of their good intention. “Others employ themselves in studying the explanations of the precepts and ceremonies, that is, kn owledge of the ‘Mishna,’ called by some the oral law, from having been formerly retained in the memory of sages, and conveyed verbally to their disciples. “And lastly, many aspire to the highest con - templation of the mysteries contained in the words, let ters, points, and musical accents used in the con - struction of the text of the law."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 43 “R.

Hence it may be understood what “Cabala” is, and how it is divided into two part s. . . .’ “A demonstration will now be attempted, for the information of the curious, as to the means employed by the ‘Cabalists’ to discover the highest mysteries of the Law. . . . They have thirteen methods of discovering the mystery they attrib ute to the whole Law in a logical sense, and the secret meaning of its words. Brief examples of these rules will dearly explain their nature. . . . “The second rule is called Transposition, that is, the letters of a word being transposed, and joined d ifferent ways, form various words. . . . This rule also seems to be derived from scripture, as it says in Genesis, ‘Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord.’ The letters in the name NCh, Noah, being transposed, form ChN, grace.” By this change the numerical value of the word becomes 708 , instead of 58 . . . . “The third rule is called Gematria or Numer -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 44 ation, and is performed by numbers, being a mathe - matical mode of comprehending the Scripture, for as the Hebrew letters are numerals they contai n everything . Pythagoras said, God created the world by numbers, as did Plato (See Question 71 ); so the word BRASHITH amounts numerically to the same as TTSR BTHVRH (He formed the Law), thus drawing the conclusion, that the Law was the instrumental c ause of the creation of the world. To this question, Why does the Law begin with a B? They answer, To signify the two Laws — the written and oral, or justice and mercy, and similar things. This rule is used in different modes, as explained in ‘Pardes Ri a - monim’; they often add a unit to the amount of the letters in a word, which is called Colel, as to the word (Covenant) numerically 612 , they add this Colel making it 613 , saying, this word signi - fies the Law, which contains 613 precepts. This myste ry of numbers also appears stated in Holy Writ; for in the case of the idolatrous priests of Baal, who accepted Elijah's challenge, it says, that Elijah took 12 stones, according to the number of the sons of Jacob; his taking this number, for the speci al purpose of invoking the Lord, was not merely that 12 was the number of Israel’s sons, but because those sons were is in conse - quence of that special number in Scripture cover - ing a profound mystery. The Talmudists also use this rule in various pass ages in the Talmud, and modern authors much more so; as R. Solomon Molcho, R. Jacob ben Habib, R. Mordecai, R. Sabatai and others deducing great mysteries there from.” 1 — “Conciliator,” vol. i., p. 206 . The Christian equivalent to the word Cabala 1 These statements are corroborated by Diodo rus, who says “the Chaldeans preserve their learning within themselves by a continued tradition from father to son.”"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 45 was Gnosis , knowledge , and from innumerable refer - ences in the writings of the Fathers, it is evident that the new sect, in the construction of the Gospel and ritual of the Church, perpetuated the same mystical tradition which they had received from the Hebrews. The nature of the Knowledge is explicitly stated by Clement of Alexandria, in the following words: “And the GNOSIS itself is that which has descended by transmission to a few, having been imparted unwritten by the Apostles” (“Miscell.” bk. vi., ch. 7 ). St . Basil also alludes to it thus: “They [the Fathers] were well instructed to preserve the veneration of the mysteries by silence. For how could it be proper, publicly to proclaim in writing the doctrine of those things, which no unbaptized person may so much as look upon?” — “De Spiritu Sancto,” c. 27 . From expressions of this kind it becomes apparent that the importance, attached to the unbroken continuity of the Apostolic succession, was due to the necessity for securing the transmission of the oral Tra dition or Gnosis unimpaired, in order that the true interpretation of the Gospel might be insured to succeeding generations. The works of Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius have numerous references to the Gnostic practices of the Christians, and par ticularly to the Cabalistic process of Gematria. The fact, that the numerical system of the Cabalists and Gnostics is generally condemned by the Fathers, appears to be no more than a priestly artifice, intended to deceive the vulgar, and prevent inquisiti ve people from prying too deeply into the mysteries, which were retained as the exclusive property of the few, referred to by St. Clement. That the Greek philosophy rested upon the same secret tradition, which was accepted and retained as the basis of t he Christian theology, in common with other religious and philosophical"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 46 systems, seems to be borne out by another pass - age from the “Miscellanies”: “Peter says in his ‘Preaching,’ Know that there is one God, . . . who made all things by the ‘Word of H is power,’ that is, according to the Gnostic Scripture, His Son. Then he adds: ‘Worship this God, not as the Greeks’ — signifying plainly, that the excellent among the Greeks worshipped the same God as we , but that they had not learned by perfect know - le dge that which was delivered by the Son. ‘Do not then worship,’ he did not say the God whom the Greeks worship, but ‘as the Greeks — changing the manner of the worship of God, NOT AN - NOUNCING ANOTHER GOD . . . . Neither worship as the Jews; for they, thinking that they only know God, do not know Him, adoring as they do angels and archangels, the month, and the moon. . . . For what belonged to the Greeks and the Jews is old. But we, who worship him in a new way, IN THE THIRD FORM , are Christians” (“Mis - cell.” vi., ch. 5 ). Theophilus Gale, one of the most learned Puritans of the seventeenth century, says, that “The Jews, in imitation of the Pythagorean In - stitutes, made the Cabala their codex or Canon - Law” (“Court of the Gentiles,” vol. iii., p. 216 ); and again on page 217 , he repeats, “As for the Jewish Cabala or Cabalistic mythologie it seems to me exactly framed in imitation of the Grecian Mythology and symbolic mode of philosophizing. It’s true the Jewish Church had even from its first inst itution, its choicest mysteries delivered in Symbols, Parables, Enigmes, and other terrene shadows.” He speaks further of the Jewish Tal - mud or system of traditions, called the oral Law, which, he says, the Jews “equalize unto, yea prefer before the Scri ptures. For they say (just as the Papists of their Traditions ) ‘that we cannot arrive"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 47 at a perfect explication of the Divine precepts, but by the traditions of the ancients; again, that without the oral Law, the whole written Law is wrapped up in darkne sse.’ ” This is corroborated by Lightfoot, probably the most competent Rab - binical scholar of the English Church, who declares, “That the Jews venerate the oral Law as the founda - tion of the written Law, and scruple not to say, ‘the words of the Elders a re weightier than the words of the Prophets.’ “ The Jews were not the only people who possessed a mystical tradition, for the Neo - Platonists of the Alexandrian School claimed to have had a “sacred succession,” by which the inner doctrines of the school w ere received and perpetuated. The Christians also had their Gnosis, said to have been received from Christ, by whom it was transmitted to the Apostles, and successively to the heads of the churches. 1 It is explicitly stated 1 St. Clement declared that the barbarian Scriptures were all symbolical, and to be understood required “an interpreter and guide. For the y considered that, receiving truth from those who knew it well, we should be more earnest and less liable to deception;” and speaking of his own tenets, he says (bk. v., ch. x.), “Rightly, therefore, the divine Apostle says, ‘By reve - lation the mystery w as made known to me,’ for without a guide or interpreter to reveal the meaning of the Scriptures, the mysteries are hidden and dark.” Such a revelation as was given by St. John, in his “Revelation” is as obscure as the Parable which it is supposed to lay bare. A plain explanation of the Gosepl was handed down by oral tradition only, as St. Clement intimates, for “fear of the swinish and untrained hearers.” ”Even now I fear, as it is said, ‘to cast pearls before swine, lest they tread them under foo t, and turn and rend us!’ . . . . For scarcely could anything which they would hear be more ludicrous than those to the multitude.” (“Miscell..,” bk. i., ch, i.) Thus without disguise he gives the reason why “the mysteries of faith are not to be div ulged to all.” All old philo - sophers and priests, Christian or otherwise, had the same dread of the vulgar and profane, and had the same motive for con - cealing their mystical doctrine from the people, namely, lest it should be turned into ribaldry."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 48 by Mosheim (“Ecc. Hist.,” ii. , p. 57 ) that “the religion of Rome . . . . is derived, according to the unanimous accounts of its doctors, from two sources, the written Word of God and the UN - WRITTEN ; or, in other words, from scripture and tradition.” By the Apostolic succession the true elucidation of the mysterious wisdom of the Gospel was secured, and presumably is still re - tained in the unreformed churches. After the Reformation the Protestants discarded the original traditions of the Church, and eventually ceased to rega rd the Papal authority, received uninter - ruptedly from St. Peter, as being of paramount importance. Thus the teaching of the traditions having been dropped, the veneration of the Pope, as the representative of the Apostolic succession, gradually lapsed, and the traditional knowledge entrusted to him has ceased to be known. Whether any part of the Gnosis, alluded to by St. Clement, is still received and transmitted by the modern Popes cannot be easily discovered, but judging from the Papal nervousness at present exhibited towards Freemasonry, it may be surmised that some faint remnant of the ancient knowledge is even now in the keeping of the Vicar of Christ. 1 As the practice of Gematria, defined by Menasseh ben Israel, will be constantly used throug hout the present work, the following instances will explain the method of its application in the works of the philosophers.

In Greek PARA - DEISOS (Paradeisos) has the same numerical value, and is equivalent by Gematria to O KOSMOS , 670 + 1 = 671 ; and KOSMOS being numerically equal to 600 , implies the number 1,040 , which is the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac contained within the Holy Oblation for a vesica 600 broad is 1,040 long. MAKRO - KOSMOS , 831 , was the name given to the Father, or the first three steps for ming the upper triad of the Cabala. These three steps form a triangle at the crown of the diagram. And PURAMIS , a pyramid or tri - angle, has also the value of 831 . By Gematria these two words are equivalent to FALLOS (Phallos), 831 , and according to the proportion of the figure of Cesarino, 831 multiplied by 9 1 / 2 gives the height of a man, stretched crosswise in a square enclosing a circle 7,899 in diameter, or the length of the polar diameter of the earth measured by British miles. Again H GNWSIS (the Gnosis), 1,271 , and STAUROS a cross, have each the same numerical value; therefore the Gnosis of the Christians may be said to be the knowledge of the cross.

The theory of the Cabala teaches that these ten steps symbolize a trinity of persons, whose function consists in re - ceiving and transmitting the spirit of life in its passage from heaven to ea rth. The first three steps shadow forth the first person of the trinity, called “Long face,” the Macrocosm, or the Father. The next six steps are assigned to “Small face,” who is called the Microcosm, the King or Son, the second person of the trinity. The tenth and last step is personated by the third person, called Mal - chuth, the Bride or Mother. Each of these ten symbols is associated with one of the heavenly bodies, so that the whole diagram is an epitome and image of the universe. The ideas whic h the ancients connected with these three persons, combined into this figure of ten progressive steps, appear to form the basis of all their philosophy, religion, and art, and in it we have the nearest approach to a direct revelation of the traditional sci ence, or Gnosis, which was never communicated except by myths and symbols. A very little knowledge is required to recognize the identity of the cabalistic doctrine with that of the Gospel, for the Christian Trinity is clearly derived from the geometrical disposition of the ten steps. Kircher (“Œdipus,” tom. ii., pars 1 , p. 289 ) has given one of the most complete illustrations of the diagram which is now available.

The first three steps are att ributed to the Empyreum, while the seven planets are comprised in those which are below; the tenth step being assigned to the moon and the sublunary world. It is thus apparent that the Father represents the super - celestial region, the Son the intermed iate space occupied by the seven planets, while the Bride or Mother is relegated to the four elements, which have the earth as their centre. Consequently we see in the scheme of the Hebrew philosophy, that the Deity — in whose image man’s twofold body was formed — the temple, and the cosmos are one and synonymous. Although the only direct version of the Cabala which we possess is that of the Jews, it is abso - lutely certain that a similar oral tradition founded upon the same doctrine was current among the Gr eeks. All the early Christians, who knew their Cabala, declared that Plato had borrowed his ideas from Moses. Nor was Plato ignorant of that mystical symbol, the cross, which was a sacred emblem long before it emerged from obscurity in the first century . The allusion to the cross, in the famous passage in the “Timæus,” has often been commented upon, and there can be no doubt that it prefigures the Mythos, which afterwards ap - peared in the Christian Gospel. It is quite plain that Plato, in describing the Demiurge or Logos, compounded out of the Zodiac, all the planets, and the elements, is referring to the second and third persons of the cabalistic triad, whose bodies com - prise the material universe, and who were created in the image of the Elohim, m ale and female. This Androgynous being the creator, “divided lengthwise into two parts, which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter X, 1 and bent 1 The letter Chi has the va lue of 600 as a numeral, so that it is the numerical equivalent to the word cosmos, and a vesica"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 53 them into a circular form, connecting them with themselves and each other at the point oppo site their original meeting point.” The two limbs of the cross symbolize the double sex of this “heavenly creature,” whom we find in the Apoca - lypse standing amidst the seven candlesticks or planets, or as the image of Daniel, and again as FIG . 7. — THE MACROCOSM .

His height being 96 digits, the perimeter of the square is 384 digits — the number of the soul of the world according to Plutarch — and if he were drawn within the Holy Oblation, then his body would extend through the seven orbits of the planets to the sphere of the Zodiac or fixed stars, and exactly resemble the figures of the Macrocosm, which appear in the works of the mystic philosophers of the seventeenth century. The figure of the lesser man would occupy the square, whose area is half that of the Holy Oblation. 1 Now the Microcosm whose body is disposed saltire - wise, like the letter X, exactly agrees with the description of Plato’s Logos, whom the early Fathers considered to be identical with their Christos. And when the Microcosm or Logos is stretched crosswise in a circle, drawn within the Holy Oblation, the sides of the square surrounding his body measure 1,480 diameters of the sun, and the name Christos is numerically equal to 1,480 . On reading the trea - tise of Francis Potter on the number 666 , it is obvious that the interpretation given is founded serpent, at his left a stuff, and shield at his feet. There is anothe r figure of the Microcosm exactly resembling the lesser man of Cesariano (p. 240 ). The square inclosing his body is surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac. There are also two other figures (pp. 239 , 241 ), each drawn within a circle having one of the seven planets corresponding to some member of their bodies. 1 The duplication of the square illustrated by the relative sizes of these two figures is minutely explained by Plato in the “Meno,” par. 82 . (Jowett’s translation, p. 43 ). The old Masonic writers declare that the true system of the universe, and the foundation of all geometrical proportion is to be found in the forty - seventh proposition of Euclid, as expounded by Pytha - goras, and communicated in writing by Plato, because, apparently, the ration which those two figures bear to one another is calcu - lated by it."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 57 upon some knowledge of the true meaning of the number, which it was not the intention of the author to rev eal. For the “explanations” are very often mere verbal quibblings, which mean little or nothing. However, he occasionally commits him - self to a direct statement, as when he says — follow - ing the interpretations of Rupertius and P. Bongus (“De Numerorum M ysteriis”) — “that the number 666 is not only the number of the Beast's name, but also the number of God , that is, it is a number which God hath pleased to name and reveal to men, that by counting of this number, they might find out that other number , whi ch it pleased not God ex - pressly to name in this place, but rather mystically to conceal, etc.” (p. 60 ). From this we learn that “by counting” the number 666 we may discover the number of God. The term “counting” might very properly be used here to de scribe the process of finding the circumference of a circle 666 in diameter, that is, 2,093 — the diagonal of a square whose sides are 1,480 , the numerical equivalent of Christos, the name of God. Francis Potter does not count the number in this way. He e xtracts the square root of 666 which he computes at 25 41 / 5 1 51 or 25 25 / 3 1 , or 25 806 / 1 000 remarking, that “however the number of the frac - tions be variable, yet the number 25 is always con - stant and the same.” The fractions curiously in - troduced may possib ly give us an indication of the methods of those cryptic writers. For 41 multi - plied by 51 produces 2,091 , a number which is only one and a frac - tion less than the side of the Holy Oblation containing the square 1,480 , the numerical equivalent of Christos . The next fraction is 25 / 3 1 , and the product of the two numbers is 775 , or the perimeter of the Holy Oblation, taking the Sun’s distance at 10 . It is, in fact, another way of ex - pressing the number 2,093 . The third fraction is"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 58 apparently the true one: but the square root of 666 is more nearly 25.807 than 25.806 . The two figures include three persons, for the Microcosm or lesser man represents the double sexed creature, whose bride, or the feminine half of his body, is fixed to his back. According to the Cabala, they were not always conjoined in this way, but were sometimes separated. In Cesariano’s figure only the masculine half is visible. In the case of the temples, it is difficult to see how these figures of Cesariano's could have been used, unl ess they were associated with specific measures; therefore we may conclude that they formed the canon or rule of measurement in archi - tecture. Any measure of the universe could be identified with their bodies and applied to a temple, and it would thus bec ome possible to canonize a certain number of figures which for convenience and use could be recognized, as the sanctioned patterns for the practice of the architectural arts. Originally the builders must have been instructed by the priests, and the rule of Vitruvius could only have resulted from a theological system based upon cosmic science. An illustration by Cataneo the architect (“Architectura,” p. 37 ), who wrote in 1554 , gives the plan of a Christian church disposed crosswise according to the figu re of the Macro - cosm, or, as he calls him, Jesus Christ. What Hippolytus (“Refutation,” bk. v.) tells us of the doctrines of the Nasseni seems to show that their creed was derived from the Cabala, and is a valuable illustration of its meaning. The Nasse ni were a sect of Christian Gnostics, who worshipped the Logos under the name and image of the Ser - pent. They appear to have been of Hebrew origin, for they took their name from the Hebrew word nachash , a serpent. 1 “These Nasseni magnify, as the 1 “For the serpent is called naas [in Hebrew].” The"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE CABALA. 59 origina ting cause of all things else, a Man, and a Son of man.

For we be - hold the statues of Mercury of such a figure honoured among them. For Mercury is Logos who, being at once the interpreter and fabricator of the things that have b een, that are, and will be, stands fashioned into some such figure as the pudendum of a man having an impulsive power from the parts below towards those above. And a Mercury of this description is a conjuror of the dead and a guide of departed spirits a nd an originator of souls.

From the foregoing quotation it is plain, that the Logos or soul of the world, according to Plato, the Greek Hermes, and the Christ, according to the Christian Gnostics, are all one and the same as the Hebrew Adam Kadmon, who is the second person of the cabalistic triad.

According to the masonic traditions the initiated architects, who preceded the Collegia Fabrorum of the Romans, and the Freemasons of the Middle Ages, were called Dionysiac architects. They were said to have been instructed in the ri tes and mysteries of Dionysus, and to have con - structed the temples according to the secrets thus imparted to them. And it is a remarkable veri - fication of this tradition, that the lesser man of Cesariano is depicted with vine leaves in his hair and an u pright phallus, both well known attributes of Dionysus. No one can look at these two figures of Cesariano without seeing that they are something more than mere anatomical patterns. In later editions they become so, but here we have clearly and distinc tly a curious survival of the cosmic deity of Greece, copied and disfigured by the crude draughtsmen of the Middle Ages, but faithfully preserved, and recognizable to the last. There is still a further means of connecting the figure of Vitruvius with the Christ and the Micro - cosm. From a passage in the Cabala we learn the following very curious fact as to the body of the King: “Longitudo autem membri hujus 248 mund - orum.” Now this is the only measurement of the body of the Microcosm recorded in the Cabal a, so that it is of the highest importance as a means of identification. The fact that the measurement is given in “worlds” is also remarkable. By the proportions of Cesariano's figure, we can find the eight of the whole body by multiplying 248 by 9 1 / 2 . But by adding colel or unity to 248 we get 249 . And 249 and a fraction multiplied by 9 1 / 2 gives 2,368 , the numerical value of the name Jesus Christ.

Jowett, in his introduction to the “Timæus,” says, “The Neo - Platonists, believing that Plato was inspired by the Holy Ghost and had received his wisdom from Moses, seem to find in his writings the Christian Trinity, the Word, the Church, and the Creation of the World in a Jewish sense.” The Microcosm seems to have been used as a pattern in the practice of all the arts. Geofroy Tory introduces it in some of the lett ers of the “Champ Fleury,” 1529 , and Silvanus Morgan, the heraldic painter, shows it on a shield intended to symbolize the charges of the sixth day of creation. It stands on the shield as the image of Mercury, i.e. , Adam. He is surrounded by a lion, a hart, a horse, and a dragon, apparently corresponding to the four cosmic beasts of the Gospels (“Armilogia,” 1666 , p. 188 ). Geometrically, the diagram containing the ten steps of the Cabala is shown by Kircher and other authorities in the form ascribed by Freemasons to what they call the “Double Cube,” that is to say, an irregular hexagon, which will exactly enclose a Vesica. Consequently its length and breadth are of the proportion of 26 to 15 . It is said that the ten cabalistic steps, in their entire ty, symbolize the aspect of the Deity expressed by the four mystic letters IHVH, whose numerical value is 26 . This number was said by the Jews to comprise the most sacred mysteries of the Law. No explan - ation, however, has ever been given showing how t he number 26 afforded a key to all the science of the Israelites.

Bryant, quoting from Eusebius, refers to a very singular fish, which, described in the language of hyperbole, is probably no othe r than the Vesica piscis. Eusebius copied his account of it from Berosus, a priest of Belus, and a native of Baby - lonia, who lived in the time of Alexander the Great. After declaring that writings were preserved at Babylon containing “a history of the he avens and FIG . 12 – DOUBLE CUBE the sea” for fifteen myriads of years, he says, that in those ancient times the Chaldeans lived without rule and order , when “there made its appearance from a part of the Eruthrean sea, w hich bordered upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason, who was called Oannes. According to the accounts of Apollodorus the whole body of the animal was like that of a fish; and had under a fish’s head another head, and also feet below, similar to th ose of a man, subjoined to the fish’s tail. His voice, too, and language was articulate and human; and there was a representation of him to be seen in the time of Berosos.

He taught them to construct houses, to found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of geometrical knowledge. He made them dis - tinguish the se eds of the earth. . . . When the sun set it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all the night in the deep.” (Bryant, “Myth.” vol. iv., p. 129 ). Apollodorus called this animal Musaroj , 1,011 . Now the two vesicas whose perimeters are respectively 671 and 676 are each formed by the intersection of two circles, 1,006 1 / 2 and 1,014 in circumference, there - fore 1,011 would be a mean between the last two numbers. And the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 1,011 , is 3 21 3 / 4 or the numerical equivalent of KALOS , beautiful, and NAOS a Temple. A vesica formed of two such circles measures about 482 across. And 482 is the numerical equivalent of the name of `ROMBOS , and if two intersecting circles, 1,011 in circumference, be inclosed in a greater vesica, the latter will be inclosed in a square contained within the orbit of Saturn. Moreover, the English word Truth has the value of 1,011 , and WANNHS , 1,109 , is 1 less than the numerical equivalent of MIKROPROSOPOS , 1,110 , the se cond person of the cabalistic triad. Finally, the names of the three persons of the Hebrew Cabala, Macroprosopos, 1,101 , Microprosopos, 1,110 , and Malchuth, 496 , yield the number 2,707 , which is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 676 , the square of 26 , the length of the Vesica, and the numerical equivalent of the unspeakable name of God, IHVH . 1 1 The following statement of Plutarch may be compared with this of Eusebius. “Anaximander concludes that men were first generated in the bellies of fishes , and being there nourished"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 66 Another fish remarkable in antiquity is the whale which swallowed Jonah.

The Rabbis pretended that the mystery of the name IHVH (translat ed Jehovah in the English version of the Scriptures) lay in its proper pro - nunciation, and no pious Jew ever attempts to utter it, the High Priest alone being privileged to pronounce it once a year, in the Holy of Holies of the temple. Much philosophy may be extracted from the combination of these four Hebrew letters, which need not be discussed here, but it may be mentioned that the numerical values of the two Greek names of the Deity, ZEUS , 2 612 and APOLLWN , 3 1,061 , bear the proportion of 26 : 15 to ea ch other, and the numbers, produced from the two spellings of the name Dionysos are in the same ratio to one another. It is also probable that this ratio was used as a means of expressing one number by another. For example, the word POLIS , a city, use d as the name of the Bride in the Apocalypse, has the value of 390 , and a vesica 390 broad is 676 long, and 676 is the square of 26 , therefore the Greek word for a city may be taken to be equivalent to 26 IHVH, the Tetragrammaton.

T HE Ark of Noah has had an absorbing attraction for most people at one time of their life, but it is to be regretted that after a certain period in their career the interest gradually fades into a mere reminiscence of the nursery. How or when it happened that the ship which miraculously saved the just Noah and his family and the beasts of t he earth came to be manufactured into a toy for children, is a question which it would be difficult to answer; but it may be accepted that the Hebrew elders, who constructed the curious and ingenious parable of the flood, and all the details of the voyag e and salvation of Noah, had probably other intentions than the invention of a plaything for their grandchildren. In the ages preceding the nineteenth century this seems to have been quite well understood, and the references to the Ark found in the work s of early writers show that the story was received in an allegorical sense; by the early Christians it was evidently regarded as a myth analogous to that related of the Greek Deucalion,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 69 for in the Clementine Homilies there is a refer - ence to Noah as “H im who amongst you is called Deucalion” (“Clem. Hom.,” ch. xvi.), implying that both the Patriarch and the Greek hero were fictitious personages, created to suit the variations of a similar allegory. Philo declares that the Ark was prepared in imitation of the human body, and this view is followed by Cornelius Agrippa, who says, “Seeing man is the most beautiful and perfect work of God, and His Image, and also the lesser world; therefore he by a more perfect composition, and sweet harmony, and more subli me dignity doth contain, and maintain in himself all numbers, measures, weights, motions, elements, and all other things, which are of his composition; and in him, as it were, is the supreme workmanship. From hence all the ancients in time past did numb er by their fingers, and showed all numbers by them. And they seem to prove, that from the very joints of man's body all numbers, measures, proportions, and harmonies were invented; hence according to the measure of the body they framed and contrived t heir temples, palaces, houses, theatres; also their ships, engines, and every kind of artifice, and every part and member of their edifices, and buildings, as columns, chapiters, and pillars, bases, buttresses, feet of pillars, and all of this kind. More over God Himself taught Noah to build the Ark according to the measure of man's body, and He made the whole fabric of the world proportiona - ble to man’s body. . . . “Therefore some who have written of the Micro - cosm, or of man, measure the body by 6 f eet, a foot by 10 degrees, every degree by 5 minutes; from hence are numbered 60 degrees, which make 300 minutes, to the which are compared so many geometrical cubits by which Moses describes the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 70 Ark; for as the body of man is in length 300 minutes, in breadth 50 , in height 30 ; so the Ark was 300 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high; that the proportion of the length to the breadth be six - fold, to the height tenfold, and the proportion of the breadth to the height about two - thirds. In like manner the measures of all the members are proportionate and consonant, both to the parts of the world, and the measures of the Archetype, and so agreeing, that there is no member in man, which hath not correspondence with some sign, star, intel - ligence, divine nam e, and sometimes in God Himself the Archetype .” (“Occult Philosophy,” p. 263 , Engl. Trans., 1651 .) Lomazzo (“Art of Painting,” Oxf., 1598 ) says the same thing, but adds, “by this rule the Grecians afterwards framed their stately Argo - navis.” And Montanu s (“Antiq. Judaic.,” plate L.) gives a diagram of the Ark 1 containing the body of Christ within it, thus indicating the stature and measure of the Saviour. Josephus (bk. i., ch. iii.), speaking of the long life of Noah ( 950 years) and the Patriarchs, say s, that God prolonged their life, on account of the “good use they made of it in astronomical and geometrical discoveries, which would not have afforded the time of foretelling [the period of the stars], unless they had lived 600 years; for the great yea r is completed in that interval.” Accord - ing to the Hebrews Noah was 600 years old when the Flood commenced. This hint of Josephus, that Noah was an astronomer, suggests the conclusion, that the Ark had a cosmic significance, and what it represents is probably indicated by the following passage in the Book of Enoch: “ In those days Noah saw that the earth became inclined. ” We 1 Reproduced on p. 214 ."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 71 believe that astronomically the rectangular figure of the Ark recorded the invention of the measures of the ecliptic, mythical ly attributed to Noah. This conclusion is borne out by an examination of the numbers introduced into the story. According to the Hebrew chronology Noah was born in the year 1056 from the creation of the world. He built the Ark in 1656 , and he died 2 006 , aged 950 . There were canons of chronology in the ancient world, as of everything else, and the dates which appear in canonical works were presumably re - corded to exemplify the mystical facts of the numerical philosophy, along with all the other circu mstances of the narrative. The numbers connected with the events of Noah's life have been evidently devised in accordance with this canonical rule, for the number 1,056 , being the length of a vesica 609 1 broad, expresses the dimensions of the Holy Oblat ion, the canonical figure, to which we have supposed that all the cosmic measures of the Scriptures are referred back. Then, 1,656 records the altitude of the sun’s course measured upon a terrestrial globe. For every “degree of latitude on any meridia n is about 69 miles everywhere, that is, 69.4 in high latitudes, and 68.8 near the equator” (Denison’s “Astronomy,” p. 9 ); and Vitruvius calculated in his time that the ecliptic was inclined to the equator at an angle of 24 degrees, therefore the distanc e of the tropics from the equator measured on the earth's circumference would be ( 69 × 24 =) 1,656 British miles. Supposing the ancients to have discovered the true proportions of the sun’s path in the ecliptic, and seeking to publish the 1 The circumference of a circu le 194 in diameter is 609 , and 194 is the width of the Holy Oblation if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 ."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 72 fact accordin g to their mystical custom, they would look for a symbol whose shape would agree with the space they had measured in the heavens. A city would obviously be unsuitable for the purpose. A temple would hardly meet the case, so they not unnaturally hit upon the form of a ship as a means of expressing the measures of their discovery, and proceeded to devise a myth which would at once explain and conceal the facts. The story of Noah is the Hebrew version of a mythos, which was universal in antiquity, having been probably invented by the Egyptians. Faber, one of the last of the old school of mythologists, says, “not content with making the sun sail over the ocean in a ship, they considered the whole solar system as one large vessel; in which the seven pl anets act as sailors, while the sun as the fountain of ethereal light presides as pilot or captain. These eight celestial mariners, who navigate the ship of the sphere, are clearly the astronomical repre - sentatives of the eight great gods of Egypt” (“O rigin of the Pag. Idol,” bk. iv., p. 218 ). The ancients, however, counted only seven planets, including the sun, so that the pilot must really be the personification of the eighth sphere or zodiac, who is here called Noah by the Hebrews, while the seven m embers of his family, saved with him, correspond to the seven planets. The numerical value of the name applied to a ship by the Greeks gives it a cosmic meaning. For the word NAUS yields the number 651 , the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2, 046 , the diameter of Saturn's orbit. By Gematria, it is equivalent to Plato's favourite word, 'EPISTHMH , science, and ΤΕΛΕΤΑΙ , mystic rites. It is prob - ably for this reason that the Church was called a ship ( NaÒj and Navis), since the temple was desig ned as an image of the universe. Again,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 73 `H NAUS has the value of 659 , or 1 / 1 2 of the earth's diameter in miles ( 12 913 7 , = 659 5 / 1 2 ). The observations of Theophilus Gale are always instructive; in a passage on the building of the Ark, he sa ys, “We need no way doubt, but that Noah had been fully instructed by Church - Tra - dition from his godly predecessors Methuselah, Enoch, and Seth, touching the creation of the world by God, and particularly touching the excellent fabric of the heavens, th e nature of the celestial bodies, their harmonious order and motion; that the sun was made to govern by day, and the moon by night. . . . And it is the opinion of some (which is not without probable grounds), that the whole story of the creation, wr itten by Moses, was conveyed down even from Adam to his time, by a constant uninterrupted tradition, to the holy seed and Church in all ages. . . . That the people of God were, in the infant state of the Church, much ravished with holy contemplations of the glory of God, that shone so brightly in those celestial bodies, their order, government, motion, and influence is evident in many philosophic, yet gracious medita - tions, we have to this purpose in the psalms.” The measures of the Ark, as recorded i n Genesis, are 300 cubits in length, 50 cubits in breadth, and 30 cubits in height, or when rendered in feet, 450 × 75 × 45 feet. Its proportion was therefore that of a long narrow box, roughly agree - ing with the measures of a man’s body, and very much like a coffin, as the figure of Montanus shows. At one end there was a small window of the size of a cubit. But there seems to have been a doubt among the Rabbis whether the word translated “window” really was a window. The word in the Hebrew means “brightness,” or \"splendour,\" and it was said to have been a"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 74 precious stone, brought from the river Pison in Paradi se. Altogether it may be said that both as regards size and ventilation, the Ark was decidedly deficient for its ostensible purpose, and quite unlike the comfortable - looking house - boat with which we are familiar in the nursery. The Vesica, by its interse cting circles, formed a geometrical representation of the crossing of the two circles of the ecliptic and equator, and perhaps by the aid of this figure we may arrive at the reason for the choice of 300 cubits, as the length of the Ark. For a vesica who se width is 300.48 is 520.84 long, and 520.84 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,083 1 / 3 — the length of a side of the Holy Oblation; and 2,083 1 / 3 being the mean number between 2,092 and 2,075 , which is 1 / 1 2 of the earth's circumference in m iles, the 300 cubits may be taken to give the length of the sun’s orbit, measured on a terrestrial globe. Assuming that our English word Ark (called in Hebrew Thebah, by the Seventy kibwtÒj , in the Vulgate, Arca) preserves the meaning of the Greek word ¢rc » and ¢rgè it would mean that which was at the beginning, the first original pattern or rule of things. That by which the ¢rcitšktwn worked, and the rule of the ¢rciereÚj , the High Priest, or Arch bishop. It would be a canonical measure of the universe and the Creator; exhibiting, by the proportions of the human body, the numbers and measures of time and space. For the sun in his journey measures a definite space in the heavens, and a recurrent period of time. The following geometrical process will ill ustrate the agreement between proportions of the Ark, and the measures of the ecliptic. If a rectangle, having a ratio of 6 to 1 , be drawn, so that its length is equal to the sun’s course, as delineated upon a terrestrial globe, the length of the Ark w ould"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 75 be equal to the circumference of the earth, and the line drawn through its centre would represent the equator. And if the oblique course of the sun be described by two straight lines, cutting the equator, so as to produce the exact declination of th e sun's orbit, it will be found that the rectangle contains a repre - sentation of the solar path, leaving a sufficient margin all round to provide a wall. The sun’s course is thus inclosed inside a long narrow coffer, and appears in the form of a bridge or pediment, marking the tropics by the sol - stitial signs of Cancer and Capri - corn, at its apex and base — the equinoctial points being marked on the equator by Aries and Libra. When the rest of the signs are drawn at their proper intervals, it is quite an allowable figure of speech to say, that the Ark con - tains all the beasts of the earth. The equatorial circumference of the earth is 24,900 miles, therefore an ark enclosing the sun's course, taking the obliquity of the ecliptic at 24 °, as computed by V itruvius, measures externally 24,900 by 4,150 miles. Internally it is 24,048 by 3,223 . If these measures be divided by 12 , as in the case of the Holy Oblation, they become, for the exterior 2,075 × 345 5 / 6 and for the interior 2,004 × 268 1 / 12 . Now if such an Ark be drawn upon the Holy Oblation, so that it is crossed by the orbits of the FIG . 13 . — NOAH ’ S ARK"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 76 seven planets, then, when Noah’s body is intro - duced according to the diagram of Montanus, it is easy to understand how the facts of this geometrical figure might be myst ically converted into the story of Noah, and the seven members of his family, who took a year's voyage in the Ark, together with all the animals of the world. If this explanation be correct, we must conceive, by the proportions of the Ark, the vast figu re of a man, in the likeness and image of God, whose body contains the measure of the sun’s path in the ecliptic, the circuit of the earth, and the orbits of the seven planets. We are, in fact, to imagine the whole material universe, accurately epitomiz ed in a human body, symbolizing the Creator reflected in creation. That the human body was used as a means of illustrating the parts of the universe, is evident from the figures surrounded by the 12 signs, depicted on old almanacks, and by the custom of astrologers, who allocate the signs and planets to the various members of the body. The length of the sun’s orbit amounts to about 690 of its own diameters ( 220 × 3 1 / 7 = 691 ), and an ark, or rectangular box, as previously described, whose length outside is 690 , measures internally 666 . The notorious allusion to this number in the Apocalypse is as follows: “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred, thr ee score, and six.” It is possible that the wisdom mys - teriously referred to by St. John, may have re - ference to the sun’s boat, which accurately measured the extent of his course in the heavens. It is generally admitted that the revealed wisdom of the Apocalypse is concerned with astronomy, and that the vision of St. John was a sight of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 77 heaven, such as astronomers see, but set forth in the mystical language of prophecy. Victorinus, who was Bishop of Petau at the end of the third century, in a treatise on the Revelation, alluding to the number 666 , speaks thus: “As they have reckoned from the Greek characters, as they find it among many to be T EITAN , for Teitan ( 666 ) has this number, which the Gentiles call Sol and Phœbus.” This statement o f the bishop explicitly connects the number 666 with the sun, and the statement in the text, that, “it is the number of a man,” further associates it with the Ark of the sun, which contained the figure of the Microcosm. In some early manuscripts of the Apocalypse the number 616 is substituted for 666 . And 616 is the perimeter of a square, enclosed by the sun’s orbit, so that both numbers record the same mea - sure in a different way. When Eratosthenes took his observations for determining the circumfer ence of the earth, he is said to have been informed that when a pit was dug at Syene in Egypt, the sun’s rays at the summer solstice shone perpendicularly into it. This place was consequently considered by the Greeks to mark the northern tropic. Can i t be a purely accidental coincidence, that the Greeks should have called the place which measured the sun’s course in the ecliptic by a name which has the value of 666 ? Assuming that it was the custom to give names an appro - priate number, and that it was known that the sun’s orbit was contained in an ark whose internal length was 666 of its own diameters, it must be admitted that Syene, 666 , was a very fitting name for a place which indicated the boundary of the sun’s path. Similarly, the length of an ark of the sun, which is measured by the tone, or interval between the earth and the moon, is 2,406 long ( 766 × 3.1416"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 78 = 2,406 ) and 401 broad. Its internal length is 2,318 , and its width is 311 . According to St. Clement, “there are some who say that 300 cubits [Tau, 300 ] are the symbol of the Lord’s sign” (“Miscell.,” bk. vi., ch. ix). Now every scholar know s that the letter Tau, 1 or cross, was the emblem of the Phallus. And the word SHMEION (sign), used here, yields the number 383 , or the radius of the sun’s orbit measured by the tone. In classical Greek SHMEION was written SHMA , 249 , and 249 and a frac tion multiplied by 9 1 / 2 , in accordance with the proportion of Cesariano’s figure, produces the number 2,368 , the numerical value of the name Jesus Christ, who was a personification of the Logos or Microcosm. The reason why the ark was considered to sym bolize the generative power in the universe may be thus explained. The diameter of the sun's orbit being about 216 times its own diameter, and the diameter of Saturn’s orbit being 2,046 of these diameters, the two orbits roughly stand to each other in the ratio of 9 1 / 2 to 1 ( 216 x 9 1 / 2 = 2,052 ). The sun is thus identified with the creative principle of the universe on account of a geometric ratio, as well as for the more obvious qualities which mark him as the fertilizing or impregnating power of t he earth. The width of an ark 216 long is 36 broad, and Philo (vol. iv., p. 453 , Yonge’s Transl.) says: “It was by the employment of this number [ 36 ] that the Creator of the universe made the world;” now the sum of the numbers from 1 to 36 is 666 , the internal length of the sun’s boat. Cornelius Agrippa perceived a parallel between the ark of Noah and the ship Argo.

Supposing the number 374 to represent the length of an ark of the ratio of 6 to 1 , its width would be 62 , and 62 1 / 3 × 9 1 / 2 = 592 , by which we get the size of a man inclosed within a square having a perimeter of 2,368 ( 592 × 4 = 2,368 ). And 62 squared, if we increase the fraction, gives the number 3,956 , the number of miles in the earth's radius. The name 'ARGW yields 904 , which is the circumference of the two circles which produce a vesica 249 1 / 4 long, and 249 1 / 4 x 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 . Deucalion, the name of the Greek Noah, has the numerical value of 1,320 , which is the length of an ark 220 wide, and 220 is the diameter of the sun's orbit. And a cross drawn within a vesica 1,321 long, measures 2,083 , the length of a side of the Holy Oblation. His ark was called LARNAX , 242 ; if colel be deducted the numbe r becomes 241 , which is the width of an ark 1,446 long, and 1.446 is side of a square inscribed within the orbit of Saturn; therefore the vessel of Deucalion may be conceived as signifying the body of a man surrounded by the seventh and outermost sphere of the planets. In the early writings of the Church, Noah, by his voyage in the Ark, and Christos, by His death on the Cross, fulfilled the same mystic sacrifice for the salvation of the human race, and their respect - ive symbols in each case represent ed the creative agent, whose function is to transmit the divine essence, which they supposed was received through the sun's rays, animated by the spirit of life, flow - ing round the universe in the milky way. The diagram of the Ark given by Montanus shows the body of Christ laid in it. Now the numerical value of the Hebrew name Messiah is 358 .

In a series of thirtee nth century designs in the South Kensington Museum painted on ivory, there is a measure of Christ’s body among other emblems of the passion. It is in the form of an oblong enclosure resembling the Ark. The proportions of the Ark being accepted as the measures of a human body, the following application of them to the body of truth as re - vealed to Marcus the Gnostic, may explain the meaning of an otherwise incomprehensible passage. The description is recorded by Hippolytus (Ref., bk. vi., ch. xxxix.). “The Tetrad, after having explained these things, spoke as follows: ‘Now I wish also to exhibit to you Truth herself, for I have brought her down from the mansions above, in order that you may behold her naked, and became acquainted with her Beauty; nay , also that you may hear her speak, and may marvel at her wisdom.

And he styles this element Man, and affirms it to be the source of every word, and the originating principle of every sound.” The num - bers of all these letters, when added together, amount to 6,166 . And if we suppose this to be the length of the body of Truth, according to the proportions of th e Ark, the width would be 1,027 ( 6 166 6 , = 1,027 ) , a number, which is at the same time the radius of Saturn's orbit, and the length of a"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"NOAH’S ARK. 81 rhombus ( 1,027 : 592 ) which has a perimeter of 2,368 .

The numerical value of the name 'ALHQEIA , Truth, is 64 , and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 64 is 2,080 , the side of the Holy Oblation. There - fore to the Greeks Truth meant the whole cosmic system, accurately and truly delineated. This idea seems also to have been transferred to the Christian Virgin, for MARIAM has the value of 192 , which is the width of the two intersecting circles, which form a vesica 64 wide. And it was also the doctrine of the Gnostic Marcus, that the soul of the visible universe con - sisted of seven powers, which glorify the Logos by uttering seven notes. “The first heaven sounds ”Alfa , and the one after that E , and the third ’Hta , and the fourth, even that in the midst of the seven, the power of 'Iîta , and the fifth O , and the sixth U , and the seventh and fourth from the central one, W . And all the powers, when they are connected to - gether in one, emit a sound and glorify that being from whom they have been projected” (“Ref” b k. vi., ch. xliii). It is noticeable, that in the text of Hippolytus some of the letters are written in full, while others are written with a single letter only. When these are added together, as they stand, they amount to 3,227 , which is the length of an Ark having a width of 538 , which is the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 2,151 , the number of years in the great month.

And that Plato had received some broken tradition, touching this philosophy of Adam, is evident from what he lays down in his “Poli ticus,” and elsewhere, touching the golden age or the state of innocence, wherein he says our first parent was the greatest philosopher that ever was. And Baleus (‘De Script. Brit. Cent. X.,’ Praefat.) tells us, ‘That from Adam all good arts and human wisdom flow, as from their fountain.

On the other hand, if we turn to the legend of science, we learn a totally different account of the creation of the worl d. The affair, we are told, took place at a time incredibly remote, and in a manner both vague and uncertain. The very name of the Elohim, who created and instructed our father Adam, is not even mentioned. For the primitive man, according to science , was not born of great stature, nor endowed with pre - eminent faculties, which made him at once fit to receive a profound and abstruse philosophy from the mouth of a paternal God. Instead of which, he was merely an animal who had risen from very small beginnings, and had gradually improved himself, as his opportunities permitted, till, pro - bably to his own surprise, he discovered that he was a man. And then, still retaining his old faculty of getting from worse to better, he ulti - mately learned to speak, to write, and to practice all other arts. This history, as far as it goes, is plausible and probable enough, but it lacks the fullness, which is the strong point about the tradi - tions.

In fact, it must be admitted that authoritative knowledge of the archaic history of man does not exist. All that is known of human affairs is confined to a late and recent period. This will be most apparent when it is remembered how little has been ascer - tained about the Egyptians, who lived only a few thousand years before our own time, and who re - present the culmination of a vastly remote civiliza - tion, of which we know little or nothing. Indeed, such is the scantiness of our knowledge of still more recent times, that it cannot now with certainty be ascertained whether Plato or Moses i s the older writer. 1 Although the scientist is justified in disregard - ing the traditions when these are offered as literal facts, he is nevertheless himself quite as much at fault in his attitude towards them as the serious people, who have brought discre dit upon all ancient history. For his misconception as to the value of the traditions is due to his entire ignor - ance of their meaning, and since this ignorance has come about through the neglect of those critical methods formerly in use among the old i nter - preters, if we are to understand the ancients at all, it is clear that we must return to the old manner of criticism.

The oldest treatise upon names which has come down to us from antiquity is Plato’s “Kratylos.” This dialogue was written to illustrate the origin of words, and to account for the reasons and motives which influenced the ancients in imposing their names upon gods and things, and it conse - quently affords us the most reliable information available as to the views of the Greek philosophers upon this subject. But we are at once confronted with t he difficulty as to how this treatise is to be interpreted. Mr. Jowett, for instance, says: “I am not one of those who believe Plato to have been a mystic, or have had hidden meanings;” and, again: “Plato was not a mystic, nor in any way affected by the eastern influences which after - wards overspread the Alexandrian world, but one who aspired only to see reasoned truth, and whose thoughts are clearly expressed in his lan - guage.” If Mr. Jowett's emphatic opinion could only settle the difficulty, we sho uld have no further trouble in the matter, but unfortunately this opinion, so far as we know, is unsupported by the testimony of a single ancient author; at any rate it would be easy to bring forward innumerable assertions to the contrary, which are quite as credible as any state - ment of Mr. Jowett’s. The Neo - Platonists claimed to have had a secret tradition, which had been re - ceived from Plato himself, and handed down by the successive members of the school; and by this knowledge they professed to inter pret the works of the Master. According to St. Clement of Alex - andria, “It was not only the Pythagoreans, and Plato, that concealed many things, but the Epi - cureans, too, say that they have things which may"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 87 not be uttered, and do not allow all to perus e those writings. The Stoics also say, that by the first Zeno things were written which they do not readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philo - sophers. And the disciples of Aristotle say, tha t some of their teachings are esoteric and others common and exoteric. Further, those who in - stituted the mysteries, being philosophers, buried their doctrines m myths, so as not to be obvious to all.” It is evident, therefore, if St. Clement was not mistaken, that all the Greek philosophers expressed their doctrines mystically. And it must be remembered that the Greeks, amongst whom St. Clement lived at Alexandria, were the sons and grandsons of the men who had learned their philosophy in the scho ols at Athens, and there is no reason to suppose that the mere change of locality brought about such an entire change in the method of philosophizing as Mr. Jowett would have us believe. Admitting that about this time the influence of what remained of the ancient Egyptian wisdom was affecting the current of thought, it is still ridiculous to suggest that the allegorical and mystical method had not been practised by the old philosophers in Greece. Besides, the Alexandrian Greeks were only going back t o the fountain - head of all their original speculations; for, according to the evidence of their own historians, their entire theology and philosophy was first learned among the Egyptians. All the Christian Fathers declared for the sym - bolical, and not th e literal interpretation of ancient philosophy, which they regarded in the light of their own Scriptures. They believed that Plato had had access to the Hebrew law, and had based his philosophy upon it. This view was held by all Christians, down to th e nineteenth century. St."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 88 Clement quotes Aristobulus to that effect: “And Plato followed the Laws given to us, and had manifestly studied all that is said in them.” And Numenius, the Pythagorean philosopher, expressly writes: “For what is Plato, but Mos es speaking in Attic Greek?” This latter statement, that Plato had borrowed his ideas from the Hebrew Scriptures, may have been a mere fiction, invented by the fathers to give greater authority to the new Gospel. But whether they really believed it or not, there is no doubt that all educated Christians, down to within quite recent times, recognized the identity of the Greek and Hebrew philosophy, and throughout the Middle Ages even went so far as to make the works of Plato and Aristotle the text - books of theology. Now, making every possible allowance for delusion and stupidity on the part of the Fathers, is it likely that, living as they did in the midst of the Pagan world, with the oppor - tunity of being instructed by the Sophists, and even being i nitiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, as St. Clement was, they could have made a mis - take, which involves the misunderstanding of every philosophical and theological system that had ever been propounded? No doubt the Christian Fathers were not the mos t skilful of philosophers, but neither can we regard them as being the hope - less imbeciles which we should be compelled to do if we are to believe Mr. Jowett. And it must not be forgotten, that skilful or otherwise, these Chris - tian philosophers were s kilful enough to prevail against all their rivals, and establish their system as the permanent creed of subsequent ages. Having chosen to follow the united voice of the ancients as to the mystical nature of the Platonic philosophy, it now remains to show what mys - terious facts may be elicited from the discussion about names in the Kratylos."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 89 The bulk of the argument is put into the mouth of Socrates, who undertakes to instruct the others, as to the derivation of the various words. He speaks throughout in a distinctly flippant tone, and as usual, need not to be taken too seriously. There are the inevitable allusions to the geometrical mysteries, and apparently the aim of the whole piece is directed to play upon the numerical values of the different w ords, without arousing the sus - picion of the uninstructed. The opening paragraph has been numbered by Stephanus 383 , and it begins by Hermogenes say - ing, “Our friend Kratylos [ 1,121 ] has been arguing about names; he says . . . that there is a truth or correctness in them, which is the same for Hellenes as for Barbarians. Whereupon I asked him, whether his own name of Kratylos is a true name or not, and he answers ‘Yes.’ And Socrates [ 1,629 ] ‘Yes.’ Then every man’s name, as I tell him, is that whic h he is called. To this he replies — ‘If all the world were to call you Hermogenes, that would not be your name.’ And when I am anxious to have a further explanation, he is ironical and mysterious, and seems to imply that he has a notion of his own about the matter, if he would only tell , and could entirely convince me if he chose to be intelligible . 1 “Socrates replies ‘Son of Hipponicus, there is an ancient saying, that ‘Hard is the knowledge of the Good.’ And the knowledge of names is a great part of k nowledge.’ ” 1 The Sophists appear to have been the Pagan gnositcs or cabalists, as Plato explains: “ Soc. And what is the nature of this truth or correctness of names? That, if you care to know, is the next question. Her. Certainly I care to know. Soc . Then reflect. Her . How shall I reflect? Soc. The true way is to have the assistance of those who know , and you must pay them well, both in money and thanks — these are the Sophists.” — K RATYLOS ."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 90 Thus at the very outset, there is more than a hint given us, that Kratylos knew more than he was willing to reveal on this subject, and the state - ment of Socrates, that knowledge is greatly concerned with names, may be taken mystically, for since the word ONOMA , a name, yields 231 , and TO ONOMA , the name, is numerically equivalent to 601 , 1 he means, that those who know all that is contained in that number have a great part of knowledge, and further, when the opinions of Plato are examined , they will be found to be entirely consistent with the supposition that the Greeks were in the habit of regarding names as numbers, and connecting these with the measures of the universe, and the cabalistic or traditional order of the Canon. We are to ld, that “the first imposers of names were philosophers,” and legis - lators. By legislators, we suppose he means the men who formulated the Law, as the Jews use the expression, when applied to the five books of Moses, which constitute the exposition of th e rule or Canon. And it is said, “Naming is an art, and has artificers;” and again, “he who by syllables and letters imitates the nature of things, if he gives all that is appropriate, will produce a good image, or in other words, a name.” At another time Socrates is made to say, \"By the dog of Egypt, I have not a bad notion, which came into my head only this moment; I believe that the primæval givers of names were undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers, who in the search after the n ature of things are always getting dizzy, from constantly going round and round, and 1 Th e number 601 is the width of a vesica 1,041 ½ long, or the radius of the circle of the zodiac contained in the Holy Oblation, and is equivalent by Gematria to cosmos, 600 .

The consideration of the names I mentioned has led me into making this ref lection. . . . Perhaps you did not observe, that in the names, which have been just cited, the motion, or flux, or generation of things is most assurely indicated.” The above passage may reasonably be taken to mean, that the names referred to, in sett ing forth the three laws of the universe, “motion, flux, and generation” are symbols of the powers of creation and the world. Again, he says, “A name rightly imposed ought to have the proper letters. And the proper letters are those which are like the t hings.” In another place, in reply to a statement of Kratylos, that a name wrongly spelt is not a name at all, he says, ”I believe what you say may be true about num - bers, which must be just what they are, or not be at all.” This last sentence is the only open sug - gestion, in the whole dialogue, that names have a numerical value. But in the following passage, we are able to put this supposed allusion to numbers to the test, and discover Plato’s method of dis - closing his numerical philosophy. “ Soc . No more could names ever resemble any actually existing thing, unless the original elements of which they are compounded bore some degree of resemblance to the objects of which the names are an imitation; and the original elements are letters. . . . Were we not saying, that all things are in motion, and progress, and flux, and that this idea of motion is expressed by names?

Let us revert to 'EPISTHMH [ 651 ] (knowledge), and observe how ambiguous the word is, seeming rather to signify stopping the soul at things, than going round with them; and therefore we should leave the beginning as at present, and not reject the E , but make an insertion of an I instead of an E (not pisthmi but œpist»mh ). Take another example: BEBAION [ 140 ] (sure) is clearly the expression of station, and position, and not of motion. Again, the word ‘ ISTORIA [ 691 ] (inquiry) bears upon the fa ce of it the stopping of the stream; and the word PISTON [ 710 ] (faithful) certainly indicates cessation of motion; then again MNHMH [ 146 ] (memory), as any one may see, ex - presses rest in the soul, and not motion. More - over words such as 'AMARTIA [ 453 ] a nd SUMFORA [ 1311 ], which have a bad sense, viewed in the light of their etymologies, will be the same as SUNESIS [ 1,065 ] and 'EPISTHMH [ 651 ], and other words which have a good sense; and much the same may be said of 'AMAQIA [ 62 ], and 'AKOLASIA [ 333 ].” I f the foregoing passage is to be taken literally, it can scarcely be said to have very much point or sense, but if it is to be taken equivocally — each name being chosen for the sake of its numerical value, which gives it a double sense, then it is evident, that the derivations are merely used to give a facetious meaning to the word, in contra - distinction to its numerical significance. Regarded in this light, it becomes, in fact, a specimen of philosophic wit, intended for the amusement of the Sophists. This will become clearer when the numbers of each name are examined."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 93 The first word to which he draws attention is 'EPISTHMH , 651 . It occurs several times in the course of the dialogue, and is used for knowledge, in the same way that `H GNWSIS, 1,271 , was after - wards used by the Christians. Clement of Alex - andria (“Misc.” bk. vi. 18 ) says, “For real science ( ™pist»mh ), which we affirm the Gnostic alone pos - sesses, is a sure comprehension ( kat£lhyij , 1,270 ) leading up through true and sure reasons to the k nowledge ( ¹ gnîsij , 1,271 ) of the cause.” He refers to it again thus: “If then we are to give the etymology of ™pist»mh , knowledge, its signific - ance is to be derived from st£sij 911 , 1 placing” ( Ibid . bk. iv. 22 ). The motion attributed by Plato to th is word appears to be the motion of the universe, for 651 is the diameter of a circle, whose circumference is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit, measured by the diameter of the sun ( 651 × 3 1 / 7 = 2,046 ). It is therefore, numerically, the name for cosm ic science. On the same principle BEBAION , 140 , if a fraction be added, is the breadth of a vesica formed by two intersecting circles 422 wide; and a square 422 is enclosed by a rhombus whose sides are 666 . Further, a circle 141 in diameter has a circu mference of 443 , the numerical equivalent of `O LOGOS . The next word, ‘ ISTORIA , has the value of 691 , the length of the sun's orbit measured by its own diameter. The word PISTON yields 710 ; and 709 , less a fraction, is the side of a square whose diagonals are ( 1,002 × 2 ) 2,004 , the numerical equivalent of the four Greek names of the elements. The number 709 is also the measure of a cross ( 354 1 / 2 x 2 = 709 ) expressing the number of days in the Lunar Year. More - over, by Gematria PISTON is equivalent to PNEUMA `AGION , the Holy Ghost, or Third Person of the 1 912 ½ × 4 = 3,650 = radius of Saturn’s orbit by Tones."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 94 Christian Trinity. MNHMH , 146 , is equivalent by Gematria to PANAGIA , an epithet applied to the Virgin in the Greek Church. A vesica 48 2 / 3 wide is produced by two intersecting circles, whose width is 146 , and 48 2 / 3 is the square root of 2,368 , the numerical value of the name Jesus Christ. `H MNHMH has the value of 154 , which is the side of a square enclosed by the sun's orbit — the peri - meter of this square being 616 , a mystical number, which appears in some early manuscripts of the Apocalypse instead of the number 666 . The word AMARTIA , again, brings out the number 453 , and a cross, whose limbs are each 226 1 / 2 , makes up the length 453 ( 226 1 / 2 × 2 = 453 ), and 226 1 / 2 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,151 . SUMFORA , 1,311 , has the same numerical value as Tetragrammaton, whose numerical signi - ficance is dealt with elsewhere. SUNESIS yields 1,065 , which is about three times the number of days in the Lunar Year; and `H SUNESIS , if colel be added to each word, gives 1,075 1 / 2 , or the limb of a cross which measures 2,151 , the number of years in the Great Month. AMAQIA has the value of 62 , and 62 × 9 1 / 2 = 592 ; it is also the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 248 , while 'AKOLASIA gives the number 333 , a number equal to the diagonal of the New Jerusalem, and the limb of a cross which measures 666 . It may be said, that all these words by their nu merical value refer to motion, in having an agreement with the measures of the celestial bodies, in spite of the assurances of Plato that they express rest and not motion. The recurrence of the word ™pist»mh , and the introduction of so many other words, w hich produce numbers representing important measures of the heavenly bodies, and their orbits may very reasonably justify the conclusion, that here, as in so many other places, there is an allusion to the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 95 scheme of the universe, and that, in the discussio n of the origin of words, there is a mystical reference to their use, as symbols of the cosmic system, by means of their numerical value. The arguments as they stand are not convincing, and it is not likely that Plato would have written such a work a s the “Kratylos,” if it is to be taken unequivocally, as Mr. Jowett imagined, and without mystery of any kind. Neither Plato nor the Hebrew philo - sophers who declare that Adam was taught the Hebrew tongue that he might converse with God in Paradise, wro te those things, as we nowadays write a philological work, but both seem to have thought their story good enough for any one who knew no better than to believe it. Clement of Alexandria, whose testimony has been already quoted, is said to have died A.D. 22 0 , so that he lived about five hundred years after Plato. He was the first considerable writer of the Christian School, which was the final develop - ment of the philosophic eclecticism of the Greeks, and his opinions may be supposed to accurately reflec t the prevailing views of the later theologists. He, along with the other Fathers, refers to the signification of names, and treats the subject exactly as Plato did. But while Plato was satis - fied to indicate the measures of the universe simply as the thing to be known ( 'EPISTHMH , 651 ), the Christians intimated that the science of Nature was to be reached through the knowledge of the Cross, for `H GNWSIS and STAUROS have the same numerical value. Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neo - Cæsa - reia, an earl y Christian writer, called a near suc - cessor of the Apostles, speaking of the quality of names, ingeniously introduces a series of mystical numbers by means of certain words in his dis - course upon the Trinity. “I see,” he says, “in"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 96 all, three essentials — substance, genus, name. . . . We speak of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; these, however, are not names, which have only super - vened at some after period, but they are sub - stances. Again, the denomination Man is not in actual fact a denomination, but a substance com - mon to men, and is the denomination common to all men. Moreover, names such as these — 'Ad£m [ 46 ]. 'Abra£m [ 145 ], 'Isa£k [ 232 ], Iakèb 1 [ 833 ]; these I say are names. But the Divine Persons are names indeed, and the names are still the Per sons; and the Persons then signify that which is and subsists, which is the essence of God. . . . The vocable word (logos) belongs to these three genera of words, which are named in Scripture, and which are not substantial, namely, the word conceived ( 'ENNOIAN , 236 ), the word uttered ( PRO - FOPIKON , 1,080 ), and the word articulated ( 'ARQRI - KON , 36 o).” The names of the Patriarchs we shall speak of elsewhere, so it is only necessary to draw attention to the three words emphasized at the end of the paragrap h. The first number, 236 , is the length of the side of the New Jerusalem. The second number is 1,080 , which is the number of miles in the moon’s radius. The third number, 360 , is both the degrees in the circumference of the earth, and the number of d ays in the Greek year. Origen also testifies as to the mysterious properties of names. He begins with a quotation from Celsus in these words: — “Those herdsmen and shepherds who followed Moses as their leader had their minds deluded by vulgar deceits, and so supposed that there was one God, named either the Highest, or Adonai, or the Heavenly, or Sabaoth, or called by some other of those names, 1 Abam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 97 which they delight to give this world ; and they knew nothing beyond that! And in a subse - quent part of his w ork he says that ‘it makes no difference whether the God who is over all things be called by the name Zeus, which is current among the Greeks, or by that, e.g ., which is in use among the Indians or Egyptians.’ Now, in answer to this, we have to remark, that this involves a deep and mysterious subject , that, viz., respecting the nature of names; it being a question whether, as Aristotle thinks, names were bestowed by arrangement, or, as the Stoics hold, by nature. . . . If, then, we shall be able t o establish, to reference to the preceding statement, the nature of powerful names, some of which are used by the learned among the Egyptians, or by the Magi among the Persians, and by the Indian philosophers, called Brahmans, or by the Samanaeans, and o thers in different countries; and shall be able to make out that the so - called magic is not, as the followers of Epicurus and Aristotle suppose, an altogether certain thing, but is, as those skilled in it prove, a consistent system, having words which ar e known to exceedingly few. Then, we say that the name Sabaoth, and Adonai, and the other names treated with so much reverence among the Hebrews, are not applicable to any ordinary created things, but belong to a secret theology which refers to the Fram er of all things.” (“Against Celsus,” bk. i., ch. xxiv.). That the reader may follow the next section with a clear mind, we now quote the exposition of the Christian faith, defined with such perfect lucidity by St. Athanasius: “And the Catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 98 and another of the Holy Ghost. But the god - head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one; the glory equal, the majesty co - eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost.” These being the opinions of the Fathers, we are, at any rate, safe in judging their writings by what Mr. Jowett calls “oriental ideas,” for the Gospel appears to have emanated directly from the Alexandrian influences. It is, moreover, de - monstrable that the threefold unity worshipped as God by the new theologists merely exemplified afresh the conc eptions of the older philosophies of Egypt and Greece finally brought together by the conquests of Alexander the Great. Before the Christian era, the Greeks had been in the habit of summing up their theology in a Triad, or Tetrad of symbolical persons, w ho, it appears, were always analogous to the great Triad of the Cabala. Many such combinations of names are to be found in Plato’s writings. In the “Timæus” the divine Triad is called QeÒj , LÒgoj , and Yuc» — God, the Word, and the Soul. The Christian Fat hers identified these with their own Trinity, the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost. And when the various names are reduced to numbers, it will be evident that Plato and Moses, as the Fathers declared, established their theology upon a similar cosmic basis, each deriving the divine names from the numbers which occur in the Holy Oblation, the New Jerusalem and the other canonical figures. The three names of the Platonic Triad have the following values: "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 99 QEOS . . . . . 284 + 1 LOGOS . . . . 373 + 1 YUCH . . . . . 1,708 + 1 } 2,083 2,365 + 3 = 2,368 QEOS . . . 284 LOGOS . . 373 657 – 1 = 656 MESSIAS It would, perhaps, be impossible to illustrate the doctrine of the Trinity more ingeniously than by those names and their correspondin g numbers. For 284 , representing the first person, the Father, or Macrocosm, is the diameter of a circle 892 in circumference, and 891 is the numerical equival - ent of 'OURANOS , Heaven. Accordingly the num - bers deduced from those two words being each t he measure of one circle, God and Heaven are pre - sented to us as one and the same — a conception admirably set forth by the rest of the numbers. Then 284 is the width of a vesica 492 4 / 5 long, and this is the width of a vesica 853 long, which in its turn i s the width of another 1,480 long. So the name, Theos, the god of the Pagan and Christian Greeks, expresses, in a roundabout way, the same number and the same meaning, as the name Christos, 1,480 . The second and third persons, called Logos and Psyche, rep resent the twofold body of the Micro - cosm, and are appropriately symbolized by the number 2,083 , the side of the Holy Oblation con - taining the seven planets and the sublunary world. The sum of the three numbers, when colel is added to each, is the ever - rec urring 2,368 , which the Christians afterwards adopted as the complete name of God, expressed by the letters 'IHSOS CRISTOS , Jesus Christ. It is plain that the threefold deity of Plato em -"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 100 bodies in the persons of the Triad the three parts of the universe called: 'EMPUREION . 760 'EMPUREION . 760 'AIQHR . . 128 'AIQHR . . 128 — — STOICEIA . . 1,196 888 — — 2,084 ΘΕΟΣ . . . 284 STOICEIA . . 1,196 — — 1,480 And since the sum of these numbers is 2,084 , it was unnecessary for a Greek to specify the measures of the cosmos otherwise than by re - peating the three names. According to some of the old cosmogr aphers there was a region beyond the Empyreum. This was called by the Cabalists Ain Soph, or limitless expansion, an impossible conception usually as - cribed as an attribute of God. If, therefore, we add the word QeÒj , God, as symbolizing this in - finite region, beyond the three lower and nearer divisions, which manifest the Deity to us in a more comprehensible manner, we shall extend the universe to four parts. And 284 ( QeÒj ) added to 2,084 makes 2,368 as the numerical value of the Tetrad. Again, the s um of 760 and 128 is 888 , and 1,196 + 284 = 1,480 , so that from the names of the four divisions of the universe there are produced the numbers which, as will now be shown, determined the names of the great gods of antiquity, and thus labelled them as pers onifications of specific parts of the cosmic system.

Sur - rounded thus by the twelve signs, he represents the Messiah, or periodic Divinity, connected with the cycle of the great precessional period of 25,816 years. A month of this grea t year is 2,151 years ( 12 816 25 , = 2,151 ) , and it is supposed that the ancients accepted the particular sign, in which the sun rose at the vernal equinox, during this cycle, as the symbol of the Messiah.

For Ammon has the value of 931 , and 932.10 is the length of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,151 . This heralding of a new Messiah, every month of the Great Year, had a peculiarly mystical meaning. For having conceived the universe in the lik eness of a woman, they made their image or type to conform literally to the original or arche - type, and looked forward with joyful expectation to the fulfilment of time, when a new Saviour would come, and symbolically purge the sins of the world, and a ccomplish its renewal and regenera - tion. 1 We have seen that the twelve signs of the Zodiac, according to Villalpanda’s diagram of the camp were identified with the twelve tribes of the Israelites. The twelve tribes were considered by the old theologians to prefigure the twelve apostles, who were also said to be analogous to the signs of the Zodiac. In the first century the sun had passed from the Ram to the sign of the Fishes. Now, taking the order of the apostles as it is given by St. Mark (ch. iii. ), and supposing Petros, the fisherman, to correspond to `Icquej (the fishes) the names of the apostles represent the sequence of the signs in the new epoch, as follows: March .

The names of the apostles analogous to these in the new cycle ar e, 'Iakoboj , F...lippoj , Qèmaj , and S...mwn . The name dèdeka (twelve), so frequently applied to the disciples in the New Testament, very fitly expresses their true significance by the number 834 , which is the side of a rhombus 1,446 long, or the side of th e square contained in the orbit of Saturn, encircled by the twelve signs. The number deduced from the twelve pagan names of the Zodiac, is the perimeter of a rhombus 2,642 wide, which is produced by two intersecting circles with a united width of 7,926 , or the number of miles in the equatorial diameter of the earth. Accordingly, the number 10,569 affords the means of correctly determining the distance of the twelve signs on a terrestrial globe. The apostles, again, belonged to the theological system of the Gospel, which presents the mythos in the third manner (St. Clement), and on that account they set forth the measure of the sublunary world, the symbol of the third person of the Triad. For the sum of the twelve names is 10,598 , or the circumference o f the moon's orbit divided twice by twelve ( 3,372 × 3 1 / 7 = 10,597 ). The Greek Zodiac, therefore, may be said to denote the solar year, while the apostles of Messiah, 656 , signify a lunar month, or lunar year. Moreover, by the cabalistic process of transposition, the number 10,569 may become 10,596 + 1 = 1 0,597 and is equal to 10,598 – 1 = 10,597 ,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 104 therefore the great Greek Zodiac and the twelve disciples of Christos are analogous to one another. 'IHSOUS (Jesus) yields the number 888 , which is the length of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,046 , the diame ter of Saturn's orbit. And a circle, whose circumference is 888 contains the square of the New Jerusalem. The Holy Ghost, the third person of the Chris - tian Trinity, corresponds to the Bride of the Cabala, and properly personifies the sublunary world or four elements, and as the embodiment of the receptive and reproductive principle in genera - tion, she symbolized the earth, the mother of all living creatures. Now, TO PNEUMA `AGION (the Holy Ghost) has the value of 1,080 , which is the number of miles in the moon's radius. She is thus also a personification of the moon, whom the ancients regarded as the wife or sister of the sun. Again, PNEUMA `AGION , without the article, yields (deducting colel from each name) 708 , and a saltire drawn within a square, whose sides are 708 2 / 3 , measures ( 1,002 x 2 =) 2,004 , the numerical value of the Greek names of the elements. 1 The number 708 is also the measure of a cross whose limbs are 354 long, the number of days in the lunar year. The name was also sometimes writ ten TO `AGION TO PNEUMA , which gives the num - ber 1,450 : and, if colel be deducted from each word, the remainder is 1,446 , the side of a square contained within the orbit of Saturn. By this number she is manifested as an image of the whole material univ erse, and corresponds to the yàc» tou kÒsmou , the Soul of the World, described by Plato. The Bride, likened by St. John in the Apocalypse to the Heavenly City, the new Jerusalem, is another figure of the Holy Ghost, and 710 ( Pneàma 1 See Chapter vi., p. 142 ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 105 “Agion ) is the length of a vesica 409 2 / 3 broad, and 409 1 / 1 5 is the length of a second vesica whose breadth is 236 , the length of the wall in each of the four sides of the celestial city. Robert Flood has beautifully illustrated the figure of this heavenly woman, standing in the midst of the cosmos with her feet upon the elements, and her head reaching up to the firmament (“Utriusque cosmi majoris scilicet et minoris . . . historia,” 1617 ). There were also various other names applied to the Christian Trinity singly o r collectively. The word Kurioj , Lord, for instance, has the value of 800 , which is the perimeter of the New Jerusalem, within the wall ( 200 × 4 = 800 ). None of the names given to Christ was more often used than that of the Saviour and Ð Swthr , if colel be added to each word, yields 1,480 . Jesus was said to be a Nazarite, and he is frequently called Jesus of Nazareth. Now the word Nazura‹oj y ields 1,239 , which is the width of a vesica 2,151 long. It is evident that the numbers obtained from all these names are simple cosmic measures de - rived geometrically from the canonical figures of the Holy Oblation, the city of Ezekiel, and the New Jer usalem, identifying the Deity with the measures of the universe. To return to the “Kratylos,” an analysis of the statements which are made there with reference to the names of the Greek Deities suggests, that the same mystical principle of naming the God s existed among the Greeks. Plato says, that there was reason in the Athenians calling “the essence of all things `ESTIA , 516 .” Now the numbers 511.5 and 520.83 are respectively the sides of rhombi whose perimeters are 2,046 , the diameter of Saturn’ s orbit, and 2,083.33 the side of the Holy Oblation. And the 516 , 16 being the mean number between the two, may be very properly"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 106 said to represent the sphere of the fixed stars, which was supposed by the old philosophers to contain the vital essence of all existing things, and was symbolized by the Christians in the name Christos, 1,480 , who was supposed to be extended crosswise within this sphere. The name `ERA , 109 , he says, “may have been given, when the legislator was thinking of the heavens, and ma y be only a disguise of the air ( ¢šr ), putting the end in place of the beginning. You will recognize the truth of this, if you repeat the letters of `HRH , 116 , several times over.” Now 109 is the mean radius of the sun’s orbit, its dis - tance from the earth being from 108 to 1 to of its own diameters. `HRH again has the value of 116 . And 116 1 / 2 is the diameter of a circle 365 , the num - ber of days in a year. And when he tells us to repeat the letters several times over, he apparently means the number s, which are the equivalents of the letters, for all the following multiples of 116 are mystical numbers. 116 × 2 = 232 , 116 × 6 = 696 , 116 × 7 = 812 , 116 × 8 = 928 , and 116 × 9 = 1,044 . These numbers will be referred to, and explained further on. For the present, it is enough to say that Hera was the wife or feminine part of the androgynous Zeus, whose nam e we shall now proceed to examine. To use Plato’s own words, “the name of Zeus has an ex - cellent meaning although hard to understand, be - cause really like a sentence which is divided into two parts; for some call him ZHN , and use one half, and others wh o use the other half call him ZEUS ; the two together signify the nature of the God.” And he further declares, that these names are appropriate to, and symbolize “the God, through whom all creatures always have life.” The numerical value of this double name is 677 , that is, ΖΗΝ , 65 , + ΖΕΥΣ , 612 = 677 , and we have"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 107 been told that its meaning is “hard to understand.” Nevertheless, by the help of geometry, it may be possible to discover Plato’s intention. The divi - sion of the God into two is evidently i ntended to exhibit his androgynous nature, the double name Zen - Zeus being equivalent to the Hebrew Elohim, the twofold Deity of creation. The number 677 , when colel is added and abstracted, produces the numbers 676 and 678 . The first of these is the sq uare of 26 , the value of Tetragrammaton, while 678 is the length of the sun's orbit ( 216 x 3 1 / 7 = 678 ), the former number having a feminine and the latter a masculine significance. The four letters, which compose the name ZEUS , have been supposed to be analogous to the Tetra - grammaton of the Jews, accordingly it may be received, in a geometrical sense, as an illustration of the square or rhombus. Among the Romans and Italians of the Middle Ages, Zeus was identi - fied with the planet Jupiter, and we fin d in the series of the planets, designed by Baldini, that Jupiter sits in his chariot on a cube, or square seat. He is also depicted thus, in the edition of Hyginus, printed at Venice in 1488 . This quad - rangular form, as an attribute of Zeus, is trace able to the number 612 , for a square, whose sides are 153 ( 153 × 4 = 612 ), is just contained within the sun’s orbit, so that the great God of the Greeks, by the numerical value of his name, in exemplifying the measure of the sun’s course, may fitly be r e - ceived as the symbol of that animating power, which flows from the sun, and gives life to all things. Apparently in imitation of this, the Chris - tians afterwards perpetuated the same conception, by similarly placing Christos in a square, within the sphere of the firmament. Such a striking geometrical parallel between the two great gods of antiquity is not likely to be an accidental cir -"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 108 cumstance, exhibiting no community of purpose on the part of the legislators, as Plato calls them, who devised a nd established the Greek and Chris - tian theological systems. The number 612 was also a mystical number among the Hebrews, who, by adding colel, produced the number 613 . There are 354 days in the lunar year, and a vesica 354 wide is 613.6 long; the two intersecting arcs of which it is composed measuring 741.417 . The diameter of the two circles is 708 , and their united width is 1,062 . The numbers produced from this diagram are certainly remarkable. In the first place 354 is the number of days in the lu nar year, and the equivalent of Ð Qeoj ; secondly, 708 is the side of a square whose diagonals are 2,004 , the numerical equivalent of the names of the four elements (see p. 142 ), and also of the Holy Ghost, Pneuma `Agion ; thirdly, 741.416 is the circumfer ence of a circle whose diameter is 236 , the side of the New Jerusalem; lastly, the circumference of the vesica is 1,482.832 , or with a small reduction, 1,480 . “The meaning of the name 'APOLLWN , 1,061 , will be moving together, whether in the poles of heave n, as they are called, or in the harmony of song, which is termed concord, because he moves altogether by an harmonious power, as astronomers and musicians ingeniously declare.” By the numerical value of the name 'ApollÒn , the Sun God appears to be the c ounterpart of Zeus, for a vesica 612 wide is 1,061 long; therefore each brother appears to be the complement of the other, and the sum of their names is ( 612 – 1 + 1,061 =) 1,673 , or 1 less than the side of a square whose diagonal is 2,368 . The name 'ARTE MIS yields 656 . The moon was of course regarded as the wife as well as the sister of the sun, but in either case the two together represent the double potency in generation. The sides of a triangle whose perimeter is 656 are 218 2 / 3 ,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 109 or the diameter of t he sun's orbit. This triangle, being a symbol of the sun, or the male power of the universe, may possibly account for the worship of Artemis under the name of Orthia at Sparta. Artemis was also specially regarded as the pro - tectress of cities and stree ts, presumably because the geometricians found out that a rhombus whose sides are 656.85 contains a square 416 2 / 3 , or the city of Ezekiel. Again, by Gematria, Artemis is equivalent to Messias, one of the names applied to Christos in the gospel. “The na me of the Muses ( Moàsa ) and Music would seem to be derived from their making philosophical inquiries ( mÒsqai ), and LHTW , 1,138 , is called by this name, because she is such a gentle goddess, and so willing ( ™qelhmÒn ) to grant our requests; or her name may be Lhqw , as she is often called by strangers; they seem to imply by it her amiability and her smooth and easy - going way of behaving. Artemis is named from her healthy ( ¢rtem»j ) well ordered nature, and b ecause of her love of virginity, and perhaps because she is proficient in virtue ( ¢ret» ). Numeric - ally the names, Leto and Artemis, would seem to have a similar significance, for a rhombus 656.85 broad is 1,138.68 long, and this rhombus contains the cit y of Ezekiel, which may be referred to in the legend of the birth of Leto’s twins on the floating island called Asteria, the starry. It is said that the island suddenly stood still, being borne up by four pillars, which possibly refer to the four orbi ts of Mercury inclosed within the mystical city. By Gematria Leto is equivalent to DELFUS , 1,139 , the womb, and would thus appear to be the goddess who personates the cosmic mother, or the feminine essence of creation, and was wor - shipped as an embodimen t of the matter of the universe. The legend of her retreat to the float - ing island of Delos, 312 (vesica 312 : 540 × 4 ="},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 110 2,160 ), appears to identify her with the tenth step of the Cabala, for this step is hung to the figure containing the other nine steps by a chain, or properly a canal, so it might be legitimately likened to an island. When Hermogenes asks, “What is the meaning of Dionysos and Aphrodite?” Socrates answers, “Son of Hipponicus, you ask a solemn question; there is a serious and also a facetious explanation of both these names; the serious explanation is not to be had from me .” The mysterious explana tion which Socrates declines to divulge, may possibly lie in the following geometrical problems, derived from the numbers of the names. Dionysos was spelt in two ways, DIONUSOS , 1,004 , and DIWNUSOS , 1,734 . Now these two numbers are to one another in th e ratio, or very nearly so, of 26 to 15 , for a rhombus 1,001 wide is 1,734 long; accordingly they afford a parallel to the names Zeus and Apollo, and Leto and Artemis. The rhombus was one of the attributes of Dionysos, carried in the processions at the celebrations of his orgies; for although his usual attribute was the phallus, he was a masculo - feminine god. It has been shown that the number 1,002 may be taken to be one of the limbs of a cross measuring 2,004 , or the numerical value of the four ele ments, so that the name Dionysos implies that he was a personifica - tion of the Logos described in the “Timæus.” Another reason why he may be appropriately symbolized by a cross is given in the following chapter, p. 148 . He was the wine - god of the Greek s, being called by Plato “giver of wine;” and `O 'OINOS yields 470 , the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 1,480 . This seems to bear out the identity of this god with the Christos, recognized by the Gnostics, and his identification with the sea sons of the year, and the equinoxes may"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 111 also be attributed to the numbers of his name. By Gematria, Dionysos is equivalent to SABAW , 1,004 . The value of the name Aphrodite is 993 , and Plato connects her with Dionysos, 1,004 , possibly because 1,004 added to 994 makes 1,998 , the width of the two intersecting circles, which produce a vesica 666 broad. Again 994 is the perimeter of a rhombus 248 1 / 2 wide, and the vesica enclosing it has a circumference of 1,041 1 / 3 , or the radius of the sphere of the firma ment inscribed within the Holy Oblation. As the personification of the great feminine principle of nature, she ought to be con - nected with the earth. This is expressed in the number 991 , which is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 3,964 , the rad ius of the earth measured in miles. But Aphrodite had also a masculine significance; for while she was adored as the essence of all beauty, grace, and feminine fruitfulness, there was also strangely worshipped under her name a masculine power. Her image , which in her feminine aspect personated every womanly perfection, was set up in Crete and else - where in the form of a crude stake, roughly carved into the semblance of a human body, and her face disfigured with an unsightly beard. This monstrous idol m ay also be referred to the number 248 (see “Cabala,” Greater Holy Assembly, 968 ). Hesiod derived the name from 'AfrÒj , 871 (foam), which is the perimeter of a square whose sides are equal to the diameter of the sun's orbit. By Gematria ¢frÒj is equivalen t to c£oj , the primæval matter from which all things were generated. With respect to Athene, Plato says: “Modern interpreters . . . assert, that Homer meant by Athene mind and intelligence . . . This is she, who has the mind of God, Qeoà ( 484 ), nÒh sij ( 538 ).” These two words both bring out mystical numbers, 484 being the width of a vesica formed by the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 112 intersection of two circles whose circumferences are 3,042 the diagonal of a square 2,151 ( 968 × 3 1 / 7 = 3,042 ), and 538 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,152 . The name Pallas, he says, “is derived from armed dances. For the elevation of one's self or anything else above the earth . . . we call dancing ( p£llein ).” PALLAS has th e value of 342 , and a rhombus having a perimeter of 1,368 is 342 on its sides, and 1,368 is the width of a vesica 2,368 long. Again 341 × 6 = 2,046 , the diameter of Saturn's orbit. 'AQHNH yields 76 , which is the square root of 5,776 , or the limb of a cr oss which measures 11,552 , or the surf’s distance measured by the diameter of the earth; and 76 , with the addition of a fraction, is the square root 5,920 , or the perimeter of the square 1,480 . It will be enough to notice here that the name of this m ysterious goddess of the Athenians exhibits those numbers which after - wards are found so prominently in the Christian theology. Some other characteristics of this goddess will be considered, in reference to her great temple on the Acropolis. Hermogenes asks, “But what is Sel»nh (moon)? Soc . That name is rather unfortunate for Anax - agoras. Her . How so? Soc . The word seems to forestall his recent discovery, that the moon receives her light from the sun.” Now `H SELHNH has the numerical value of 309 , w hich is the diagonal of a square inclosing the sun’s orbit, which is possibly what Socrates refers to; and a rhombus, 309 broad, is 535 long and 535 is the value of KTEIS , a word used for the womb by the Greeks (Clement of Alexandria); and 309 is 1 / 7 of the moon’s diameter in miles ( 309 × 7 = 2,163 ). “Then surely Pan, who is the declarer of all things ( p£n ), and the perpetual mover ( ¢e... polwn , 1,046 ) of all things, is rightly called 'AipÒloj , 461 (goatherd), he being the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 113 two - formed son of Hermes, smoot h in his upper part, and rough and goat - like in his lower regions. And as the son of Hermes he is speech, or the brother of speech, and that brother should be like brother is no marvel.” The name Pan, every - thing, has the value of 131 , and a square, w hich has a perimeter of 130 is 32 1 / 2 on its sides, and 32.35 is the square root of 1,046 1 / 2 , the radius of the circle containing the square 1,480 within the Holy Oblation. Then 130 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 408.4 , which is th e length of a vesica whose width is 235.3 , the length of the wall on each side of the New Jerusalem. Hermes yields the number 353 , or one less than the number of days in the lunar year. Again, 353 is the perimeter of a square whose sides are 88 1 / 4 , or the space between the tropics measured by the diameter of the sun. And 353 is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 1,110 , which is the numerical value of the name Microprosopos, the second person of the cabalistic triad. There - fore Hermes appears to symbolize the lunar year, and the measure of the ecliptic, thus symbolizing the masculo - feminine nature of the Logos. From `ERMAOIS , another spelling of the name, the number 426 is obtained. A square whose sides are 426 is contained in a rh ombus whose sides are 671 , the nu - merical equivalent of Adonai; and 425 × 3 = 1,275 . Ares has the value of 309 , which is the diagonal of a square inclosing the sun's orbit; and 309 3 / 4 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 1,239 , and this number is the width of a vesica 2,151 long. Poseidon yields the number 1,219 , wh ich is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 388 , the numerical equivalent of Ð “Hlioj , the sun; and a vesica 388 wide is 672 long, or one more than the value of T HORA . A vesica formed of two circles 1,219 in circumference contains the sphere"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 114 of the Zodiac, taking the suns distance at 10 ( 194 : 335 11 / 26 ). This god was also called POTEIDAN , 520 , or one less than the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is equal to the side of the Holy Obla - tion; and the length of this rhombus is 901 , the number of Ð fallÒj . By Gematria, POSEIDWN is equivalent to ICQUS , a fish. The value of PERSEFONEIA is 1,026 , which is the length of a rhombus whose perimeter is 2,368 . And 1,024 is the radius of Saturn’s orbit. She is sometimes called KORH , 198 , or KOURH , 598 ; 198 is equivalent to ( 12 368 2 , = 197 1 / 3 ) , and 598 is the circumference of Saturn's orbit, taking the sun’s distance at 10 . Persephone is therefore the feminine counterpart of the deity representing the number 2,368 . Heracles yields 370 , or the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 1,480 . Before the final establishment of the Christian religion, when its ultimate form was still uncertain, some of those who had severed themselves from the old pagan cults worshipped the deity under the name of Iao. And it was probably a doubtful question, for some time, whether the votaries of Iao would prevail over those who advocated the claims of Christos. However, the popularity of Iao did not last very long, and it is now many centuries since altars we re raised to this god. The numerical value of IAW is 811 , and this is found to be the circumference of a circle 258 1 / 3 in diameter. Now the Greek name of the tenth step of the Cabala was Basile...a , the kingdom, a word of very frequent occurrence in the New Testament, as, for instance, in the Lord's Prayer, “Thy Kingdom come.” And BASILEIA yields 259 , and `H BASILEIA has the value of 267 . And 266 2 / 3 is the diameter of a circle whose area is equal to that of the New"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 115 Jerusalem, so that this name may appro priately stand for the Bride whom St. John saw coming down from heaven. But Iao has still other significations, for 811 2 / 3 is the diameter of a circle whose circum - ference is 2,550 , and this is the measure of the limbs of a cross 1,275 long ( 1,275 × 2 = 2,550 ). Again, the three letters written in full bring out the number 2,492 , which is the perimeter of a triangle whose sides are 831 , the numerical value of Macrocosmos. SABAWQ is a name sometimes found in con - junction with IAW . It is a translation o f the Hebrew word which means “armies,” and has the value of 1,013 , which is also the number of the name ProtÒgonoj , the Orphic Adam, or first man. Now 1,014 × 3 = 3,042 the diagonal of a square 2,151 . Protogonos was produced from an egg, which Bryant declares was an emblem of the Ark. At any rate an Ark whose perimeter is 2,368 is 1,014 long. The names IAO SABAOTH yield 1,824 , which is the measure of a cross whose limbs are 912 ( 2 824 1 , = 912 ) . As it would require a Hebrew scholar to deal properly with the names and words of that language, very little can be said here with respect to the Jewish scriptures. It is possible, however, to mention a few facts which seem conclusively to support the principle of numeration which has been pointed out in the case of the Greek writings. Whatever doubt may exist as to the knowledge of the Cabala among other peoples, there can be no question as to its use among the Jews. This circumstance makes the Jewish law the chief source of mystical kno wledge, on account of its complete - ness, for supposing the Homeric poems to be earlier in point of time, the Law of Moses, being accompanied by the ancient traditional comment -"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 116 aries preserved in the Cabala and Talmud, is provided with the key which is req uired to unlock its secrets, while all similar aids to the understand - ing of the Greek poems are lost. In this respect the Hebrew writings stand alone, but it may be that there is in the Romish and Eastern Churches some remnant of the old oral tradition which is still handed down and preserved in silence. When, therefore, the same analysis, already applied to the names of the Greek gods, is extended to those given to the Deity by the Hebrews, it would appear that both peoples regarded the universe as the emblem of God, and each formu - lated a theology, founded upon the same numbers and symbols. In view of the entire lack of reliable evidence, it would be useless to attempt to decide whether the Greeks borrowed from the Hebrews, as the Fathers declare, or whether the Hebrews borrowed from the Greeks. It is more probable that each derived their knowledge from the Egyptians independently. And it will be enough to remember that the Jews, who make such pre - tensions to antiquity, have absolutely nothing to show in support of such an ancient origin. The name of God, most highly venerated amongst the Jews was that written with the four letters IHVH. The name was considered to be too holy and sacred to be spoken. Its communica - tion to Moses, upon the Mou nt, was regarded as the supreme revelation of the secret and mysterious nature of the Deity, and the knowledge of its pronunciation was the great arcanum of the Jewish Church, only known to the high priest. The pious Jew was taught to pause when he came t o this name in reading the Law, or to say the name Adonai in its stead. By Christians it was gener - ally called Tetragrammaton, or the Tetrad. The numerical value of IHVH is 26 ; but the number"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 117 of the letters gave it the value of the number 4 . Accordin g to the ancient computation, 4 was equivalent to 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 , and 10 was equivalent to 1 , because 1 + 0 = 1 . Regarded as the number 4 it typified the elements and cardinal points of the universe, and conse - quently the Cross or Omphalo s at the centre of the world; it also denoted the Logos, and the Bride or tenth step of the Cabala — she who was the great mother, the earth, and the city of the New Jerusalem, called Adonai by the Hebrews. Finally, the number 26 connects this aspect of the Deity with that mysterious symbol, the Vesica Piscis, for the proportion of this figure is 26 to 15 . The number 26 is also the square root of the length of the sun's orbit ( 262 = 676 and 216 × 3 1 / 7 = 678 ). This name was considered to be the same as the Tetractys of the Pythagoreans, which they regarded as the foundation of all things. In fact, by its various aspects, the IHVH of the Jews epitomized the whole mystery of the old theology, and represents the body and soul of creation. It may be viewed as the symbol of God, seen in the sun, the earth, the whole universe, or as the powers of creation, sym - bolized by the three persons of the cabalistic triad. It has been already pointed out that the ten steps of the Cabala are jointed together according to the proportion of a vesica, the symbol of Tetra - grammaton, 1,311 . Now the whole ten names, if reduced to numbers and added together, amount to 2,868 , which is the circumference of a circle 912 in diameter. The number 912 is the value of the name Prometheus, who is an exact counterpart of the Hebrew Adam Kadmon, or supernal Adam, in whose person the ten steps were symbolically manifested. By comparing the character and ad - ventures attribute d to Prometheus by the Greeks, it will be seen that he was to them what the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 118 Messiah was to the Hebrews and Christians. The Messiah, of course, was the philosophical creation of the cabalistic sages, personified as a historical person for the benefit of the populace, and this being, as portrayed in the drama of Aeschylus, is the Greek conception of the Mediator, who brings life and salvation to mortals, under the symbol of Fire. The Greek play is essentially religious in its purpose, and is a kind of d ramatic gospel, corresponding to the Mystery Plays, acted by Christians in the Middle Ages. It is written in lofty language, calculated to inspire the audience with a religious awe, in spite of the singular nature of the myth. The attitude of the poet appears to be reverent and sincere. Like Christ, Prometheus was made to suffer innocently at the hands of the Father. For Jesus was crucified to expiate the crime of Adam, who disobeyed the Elohim, while Prometheus was chained to the rock, on the pret ext of his having brought down the divine fire to mortals against the will of Zeus. Both were blameless in their lives, and devoted themselves to instruct and aid mankind. In the play Prometheus is made to say, “And verily I discovered for them Numbers, the surpassing all inventions.” And he bestowed the benefit of fire upon men by means of the Narthex (Fennel - rod), “which has shown itself a teacher of every art to mortals, and a great resource.” It was the counterpart of the cross of Christ. The num erical value of N£rqhx is 228 , or the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 912 , which seems to trebly accentuate this number, which is again found in the name Kaukasos, 912 , where the giant was bound over a great cleft in the rocks. Now 228 by 9 1 / 2 = 2,166 , or very nearly the number of miles in the diameter of the moon. The artificer of the gods, to whom was imputed an exquisite and marvellous skill in smith -"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 119 work and other crafts, was named Hephaistos, 1,289 , a number which is the diagonal of a squar e whose sides are 912 . He only differed from Prometheus ( 912 ) in that he guided the hand of the artisan, in contradistinction to the god, who taught men letters and the intellectual arts. His wife, too, was called 911 ( C£rij ), so we may suppose that all artistic handi - work was inspired by the wisdom of this number. The point of the myth appears to be that Prometheus, or the hollow reed, was the mediator between heaven and earth who transmitted the mystic fire from the moon, which is the lowest heaven. T he fire, being the highest of the elements, reached up to the lunar orb, and was therefore made to symbolize the celestial essence or spark of divine life, conveyed to mortals by the deity. But a more comprehensive meaning may be attached to the numbe r 912 , for if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 , the radius of Saturn’s orbit measures 95 , and 95 × 9 1 / 2 = 902 , or 1 more than the value of Ð fallÒj , and the radius of a circle inscribed within the Holy Oblation measures, to the same scale, 97 , and 96 × 9 1 / 2 = 912 ; thus Prometheus personifies the radius or rod, which measures the whole world. The Hebrews, like the Greeks, attributed the act of mediatorship to many persons, each of whom was a personification of the Messiah, in some aspect or another. T hus Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses are all con - spicuous embodiments of some fact in the Jewish philosophy. The Christian mythologists recog - nized an affinity between Prometheus and Noah as may be seen from the opinions of Vossius (see Gale, “Court of th e Gen.” vol. i., p. 185 ) and Bryant (“Myth.” vol. iii., p. 7 , etc.).

The Greek names of the first and second per sons of the great cabalistic triad are Macro - prosopos or Long - face, Microprosopos or Short - face, and Basileia the kingdom.

If Malchuth, 496 b e substituted for Basileia, the three names yield 2,707 , the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 676 3 / 4 , the square of 26 , and the length of the sun's orbit.

Together, with that of the bride, the numbers ( 831 x 840 + 496 ) amount to 2,167 - 3 = 2,164 , the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. The three great canonical numbers 888 ( 'Ihsoàj ), 1,480 ( CristÒj ), and 2,368 ( 'Ihsoàj CristÒj ) are to each other in the ratio of 3 , 5 , and 8 , their greatest common measure being 296 ( 296 888 = 3 , 296 480 1 , = 5 , 296 368 2 , = 8 ) . Now these three numerals, 3 , 5 , and 8 , if converted into a single number, become 358 , which is numerically equal to the Hebrew name, MS H IC H , Messiah. And 358 1 / 2 × 6 equals 2,151 , therefore a stone or hexagon, having a perimeter of 2,151 , is a geometrical symbol of the Hebrew Messiah. In the Apocalypse the Messiah is called the Alpha and the Omega ( tÒ ”Alfa ka... tÒ ’Omšga ), 2,152 . And a hexagon or stone, described round a circle having a circumference of 2,151 , has a perimeter of 2,368 , and is therefore the equivalent of 'Ihsoàj CristÒj . The period of 2,151 years, besides being the length of a month of the great year, during which time it was alleged that the w orld was regenerated, has also the peculiarity that it is the sum of the two numbers 1,480 (Christos), and 671 (Thora the Bride); it is therefore the symbol of the masculo - feminine nature of the Messiah. And a vesica 358 broad is 620 long, and 620 is t he value of Kether, the first step of the Cabala. And a rhombus 359 long is 207 1 / 4 broad, and 207 1 / 4 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 651 , the diameter of a circle 2,046 in circumference. We learn from the Cabala that Adam Kadmon was the father of the earthly Adam. He was the being, analogous to Christos in his super - mundane state, when he personates God’s essence before it reaches the earth. He is the Hebrew Demiurge"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 125 or Logos. The numerical value of Adam Kadmon is 245 , or counti ng the values of the M and N as finals, the number is 1,455 . Now a rhombus whose sides are 245 contains a square drawn within the sun's orbit and having a perimeter of 612 , the value of the name ZEUS ; and a saltire ( 122 1 / 2 × 2 =) 245 is contained with in the space of the tropics measured by the diameter of the sun. The name Kadmon, 200 , exemplifies the measure of the Heavenly Jerusalem, and must surely have an affinity with the Greek Kadmos, 335 ( 335 1 / 2 × 2 = 671 ) who built the mystical city of The bes, with its seven cosmic walls and seven gates, guarded by the seven heroes, whose shields bore the symbols of the planets. The number 335 is so near the diagonal ( 333 ) of the city of the New Jerusalem, that it may be reasonably connected with that measure. The name Adam has the value of 45 ; and this number, with a fraction added, is the square root of the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The name Eve has the value of 19 , which is the square root of 361 . The value of the two names ( 19 + 45 ) = 64 , and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 64 equals 2,080 , the side of the Holy Oblation. In the Talmud it is said that Adam’s body stretched from one end of the world to the other. At the request of the angels God reduced it to 1,000 cubits, meaning, p erhaps, that he also personates the distance between the equinoxes. Counting the M , final, as 600 ADM (Adam) yields 605 ; and by deducting 1 1 / 4 it becomes 603 , which is half of 1,207 1 / 2 , the side of a vesica 2,093 long. And 2,093 is the diameter of th e circle containing the square 1,480 . Again, 605 + 19 = 624 , the length of a vesica 360 wide. The sum of the num - bers from 1 to 9 is 45 , so that Adam may be said to symbolize the power of the ninth step"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 126 called Yesod the foundation; it is the repro - du ctive principle, and applies to Adam as the progenitor of the human race. A cross whose beams are 45.53 broad is 1,275 high, and will crucify a man within a square whose perimeter is 2,368 . The name Malchuth, the Bride, who, together with Macrocosmos an d Microcosmos, completes the great Triad, has the value of 496 . She is possibly a personification of the earth, for 495 3 / 8 × 8 equals 3,963 , the earth's radius in miles. In the “Greater Holy Assembly” (ch. xxxiv., par. 800 ), the Bride is called T H ORA , 671 , the gate, and the numerical value of T H ORA is equivalent to the name Adonai, when it is “written in its plenitude.” This means that when ADNI is spelt ALP, DLT H , NUN, IUD, the value of the letters, written thus, make up 671 instead of 65 , its simpl e value. The number 671 is exactly the mean between 666 and 676 . The name ADNI also gives 65 , which, with a fraction added, is the square root of 4,326 , or 2,163 × 2 , which is the measure of a cross whose limbs are equal to the moon’s diameter. Adonai is the great mother of the Jews, who was worshipped as elsewhere under the image of the earth, the moon, and the material universe. She symbolized the Omphalos, wi th its cross indicating the cardinal points, for she marked the central point of the world. It will be instructive to make a comparison in this place between the Virgin Mary of the Gospel, and the Bride of the Old Testament. For the Mother of Jesus, li ke the Spouse of the Hebrew Messiah, appears with all the attributes generally assigned to the feminine deities of the ancients. In the New Testament her name is spelt MARIAM , 192 , and occasionally MARIA , 152 . But in the Latin Church she was called MARI A , 252 . Her"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 127 symbol in the early Church was usually the vesica; and she is frequently depicted in early Christian art surrounded by this figure. Now a vesica 192 broad is 332 4 / 5 long, which is the diagonal of the New Jerusalem. And `H MARIAM ( 192 + 8 ) equ als 200 , or the length of a side of the same mystical city. Therefore, like the Hebrew Bride, she is the personification of the heavens, and agrees with the Greek Aphrodite Ourania. And it is notice - able that 496 × 2 equals 992 , one less than the value of the name Aphrodite. The vesica again, which is 192 broad, is formed by two intersecting circles 384 in diameter ( 192 × 2 = 384 ), and their breadth is 576 ( 192 × 3 ); and 576 is the square of 24 , the number of le tters in the Greek alphabet, and one less than the numerical value of the word Evangelion, the “Good News,” or Gospel. Again, the sum of the numbers 1,480 (Christos), and 192 (Mariam) with colel added to each is 1,674 , the side of a square, whose diagon al is 2,368 . She accordingly expresses the feminine aspect of the Gospel, while by the number 384 is indicated the amount of the sun's distance measured by the tone, and indirectly also the number 666 , for 384 is the width of a vesica 666 long. Then th e perimeter of the rhombus formed from the pre - vious figure is 768 ( 192 × 4 ), which identifies her with the cross of Christ. For, regarded as the instrument of His Passion to which He was nailed, this symbol seems to have had a feminine aspect. The cr oss, 769 broad, is 1,656 high, and 2,366 2 / 3 measured to its full extent. Like the cross, the cubical stone had also a feminine sig - nificance. And a hexagon whose sides are 192 has a perimeter of 1,152 , which is about a tenth of the sun’s distance meas ured by the diameter of the earth, and the length of a rhombus 666 wide is 1,154 long. And the number 192 is"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 128 the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 593 , or 1 more than the side of a square whose perimeter is 2,368 ( 592 × 4 = 2,368 ). In this last number we see her as the mystical spouse who represents the feminine aspect of the twofold Logos – she whom the Greeks personified as Psyche, the Bride of Love. The name `H PARQENOS MARIA , the Virgin Mary, has the value of 67 5 , or 1 less than the number 676 , the square of 26 , so she thus becomes the Chris - tian version of the unspeakable Jewish Tetrad, called IHVH . And the numerical value of Mar...am Parqšnoj is 707 , or 1 less than the side of a cross whose diagonals measure 2, 004 , the value of the names of the four elements. And by Gematria, this name is equivalent to Pneuma Hagion, Holy Ghost. Lastly, if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 , the mean diameter between the sphere of Saturn and the Zodiac is 192 , so that the pe r - son of the Virgin answers to the whole cosmic system. From the statements of theologians on the trans - lation of the Scriptures, it is made evident that the mysteries of the originals were not always retained when the text was transferred to another lang uage. Philo Judæus, speaking of the seventy translators says: “Just as I suppose the things which are proved in geometry and logic do not admit any variety of explanation, but the proposition which was set forth at the beginning remains unaltered, in l ike manner I conceive did those men find words precisely and literally corresponding to things . . . for if Chaldæans were to learn the Greek language, and if the Greeks were to learn Chaldæan, and if each were to meet with the Scriptures in both langua ges, namely, the Chaldæan and the translated version, they would admire and reverence them both as sisters, or rather as one"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 129 and the same, both in their facts and their language; considering these translators not mere interpreters but hierophants and prop hets.” — (“Life of Moses,” bk. ii., c. 7 .) Again, Origen says that “when those names, which in a certain language were possessed of natural powers, were translated into another, they were no longer able to accomplish what they did before, when uttered in the ir native tongues . . . Nay, even if we translated into the Greek language the name of an individual who had been originally invoked in the Roman tongue, we could not produce the result which the incantation professed itself capable of accomplishing, had it preserved the name first conferred upon him. And if these statements are true when spoken of the names of men , what are we to think of those which are transferred, for any cause whatever, to the Deity? For example, something is trans - ferred from the name Abraham when translated into Greek, and something is signified by that of Isaac, and also by that of Jacob; and accordingly, if any one, either in an invocation or in swearing an oath, were to use the expression, ‘the God of Abraham,’ and ‘the God of Isaac,’ and ‘the God of Jacob,’ he would produce certain effects, either to the nature of these names or to their powers, since even demons are vanquished and become submissive to him who pronounces these names; whereas if we say, ‘the God of th e chosen father of the echo, and the God of Laughter, and the God of him who strikes with the heel,’ the mention of the name is attended with no result, as is the case with other names possessed of no power. And in the same way, if we translate the na me ‘Israel’ into Greek or any other language, we shall produce no result; but if we retain it as it is, and join it to those expressions to which such as"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 130 are skilled in these matters think it ought to be united, there would then follow some result from the pronunciation of the word, which would accord with the professions of those who employ such invocations. And we may say the same also of the pronunciation of ‘Sabaoth,’ a word which is frequently employed in incantations; for if we translate the term into ‘Lord of Hosts,’ or ‘Lord of Armies,’ or ‘Almighty’ (different acceptations of it having been proposed by the interpreters), we shall accomplish nothing; whereas if we retain the original pronunciation we shall, as those who are skilled in such ma tters maintain, produce some effect. And the same observation holds good of ‘Adonai.’ If, then, neither ‘Sabaoth’ nor ‘Adonai,’ when rendered into what appears to be their meaning in the Greek tongue, can accomplish anything, how much less would be the result, among those who regard it as a matter of indiffer - ence, whether the highest being be called Zeus, Jupiter, or Zen, or Adonai, or Sabaoth!” — (“Against Celsus,” bk. v., ch. xlv.) It is difficult to understand the meaning of the preceding passage, unl ess the changes which names undergo, when translated into another language, refer to numerical changes. The words of Origen seem to be capable of a satisfactory explanation upon this principle, as will be seen when those names are examined which are sai d to signify something when translated into Greek. For in - stance, Abraham in Hebrew yields 248 , a number already discussed. In Greek the name becomes ( 'Abra£m ) 145 , which, by adding and subtracting colel gives 144 and 146 : and 144 × 91 = 1,368 , the widt h of a vesica 2,368 long; and 146 is the width of two intersecting circles which produce a vesica 48 2 / 3 long, and 48 2 / 3 is the square root of 2,368 .

'Iakèb is numerically equal to 833 , and 833 × 9 1 / 2 = 7,923 , the number of miles in the diameter of the earth. Then, “the God of Abraham” and “the God of Isaak” and “the God of Jacob” yield the following numbers: `O . . . . 70 – 1 `O . . . 70 QeÒj . . . . 248 – 1 QeÒj . . . 284 'Abra£m . . 1 45 – 1 'Isa£k . 232 ——— – — – 499 – 3 = 496 586 - 1 = 585 `O . . . . 70 – 1 QeÒj . . . . 248 – 1 'Iakèb . . 833 – 1 ——— 1,187 – 3 = 1,184 Of these 496 is equivalent to Malchuth; 685 [ sic ] is the diameter of a Circle 2,151 in circumfer ence and 1,184 × 2 = 2,368 . We are told that the name Israel, when translated into Greek, produces no result, although it possesses certain lowers in the original. Now the word IS H RAL (Israel) in Hebrew yields 541 , the side of a rhombus having a perimeter Of 2,164 , the n umber of miles in the moon's diameter; whereas 349 , the numerical value of 'Isra»l , has no obvious analogy with any measure of the universe. Although the reformers were responsible for the more modern translations of the Scriptures, they pretended to ackno wledge none but the originals. Accordingly, we find Dr. Featly, an English divine of the seventeenth century, in a report of a disputation with some Anabaptists, 1 declaring that 1 “Dippers Dipt” ( 1651 ), p. 17 . Although these early Dissenters appear to have especially asserted the claims of the “Laver,” they disapproved of the “Steeple - houses” of the king, who is accused of m aking “an Idoll of the Church.”"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 132 his opponents, who were confessedly unlearned men, could not “convince any J ew, Pagan, or Mahometan, out of their translated bible, without other aids of learning .” Again, he says, “If you will dispute in Divinity you must be able to produce the Scriptures in the original languages,” and he calls it blasphemy to deny the LETTER of the text to be Scripture. John Hutchinson is even more emphatic, for he asserts that “the Scriptures have been buried in a load of filthy translations” (“Religion of Satan or Antichrist delineated,” p. 112 ). Assuming that these writers are alluding to the numerical value of names, in their appreciation or condemnation of the translations, it is obvious that to re - introduce into a translation the appropriate numbers, as well as the sense of the original, would certainly add a serious difficulty to th e task, and if this were successfully accomplished in the Septuagint version, it might well call forth the admiration of Philo. But no translation ever does or can reproduce the peculiarities of another lan - guage. Thus, Mr. Mathers points out that, “in Isaiah, ix. 6 and 7 , the word LMBRH, for multiply - ing, is written with the character for M final in the middle of the word, instead of the ordinary initial and medial M. The consequence of this is that the total numerical value of the word instead of being 277 is 837 .” It is obvious that nobody could translate a singularity like this into another tongue. Yet it must have an important meaning, which is probably connected with the fact that 837 is the diagonal of a square whose perimeter is 2,368 . An other objection to the translations is that they are not always accurate, even as regards the out - ward sense. For example, the English translation of the eighteenth verse of the fourteenth chapter"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 133 of Numbers very inadequately renders the real meaning of the words. In the authorized version the verse runs, “The Lord is long - suffering and of great mercy:” but the literal interpretation is, “Tetragrammaton (IHVH) is long of nose (ARK APIM) and of great mercy” (Mathers’ “Cabala,” p. 213 ). The term “Long No se” is a variation of the ordinary name, “Long - face” (Macroprosopos), generally applied to the Father in the Cabala. In the “Lesser Holy Assembly” it is said ( 572 ), “The Nose of the Most Holy Ancient One is long and extended, and he is called Long of N ose.” In the “Greater Holy Assembly” the nose is mentioned in paragraph 173 : “From the nose is the face known;” and again in 175 , “This nose is as a mighty gallery, whence his spirit rusheth forth upon Microprosopos.” Now ARK APIM yields 832 , which is 1 more than the numerical equivalent of fallÒj . Italian is one of the modern languages invented, or at least reduced to writing, in comparatively recent times. Dante was the first great poet to use it, and did for the Italian what Robert Lang - lande, th e author of “Piers Ploughman,” in a lesser degree did for the language of England. Nothing had been written in the spoken or vulgar tongue till within 150 years of Dante’s time (“Vita Nuova,” p. 71 , Rossetti's translation). Before that all the literatur e of the Roman Empire had been com - posed in Greek or Latin. But from thenceforth the modern languages began gradually to super - sede those of the classical era, both for speech and writing. Their grammar, selling, and construction were fixed and regula ted by rules similar to those observed in the older languages; and presumably the grammarians, who wrote in the vulgar tongues for the first time, transferred to the newly - ap - pointed names an appropriate number, such as"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 134 they had been accustomed to in th e earlier litera - ture. At any rate, if the letters of the Latin language, and the languages derived from it, be supposed to have the same numerical value as in Hebrew, it will be found that the numbers deduced from the new words agree with the sense of the name previously established.

The numbers 325 1 / 2 (Jhesu) is the limb of a cross which measures 651 , and 913 (Crist) is the equivalent of Brashith (beginning), the first word of the Hebrew bible. It only remains, now, to examine the names of the Egyptian deities, and to show that the num - bers deduced from them exactly agree with the numerical values obtained from the gods of the Hebrews, Greeks, and Christians. The names of the great Egyptian triad, written in Greek letters, are 'OSIRIS , or `USIRIS , ISIS , and `WROS . These are the names under which these deities were worshipped in Greece and Rome. Osiris h as the value of 590 , which may be taken to be the side of a rhombus 2,368 (it ought to be 592 ). The spelling Husiris yields 920 , or the numerical equivalent of the Greek word κανων (Canon); and 97 the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac, if the Sun’s dis tance be taken at 10 , multiplied by 9 1 / 2 , pro - duces 921 . Isis, again, who is well known to have been identical with Cybele, Athene, and the other feminine deities of the Greeks, has the value of 420 ; and a cross inscribed within a vesica 421 long measu res 663 , the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2,083 , the side of the Holy Obla - tion. She is thus the counterpart of the Bride of the Cabala, and an image of the whole universe. Horus yields 1,170 , which is one - twelfth of the side of a square 14,035 , equals ( 1,169 1 / 2 x 12 ), whose"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 136 area is equal to the surface of the earth, measured in miles. The sum of the numbers, deduced from the three names, is 2,180 , which is the circumfer - ence of a circle 694 in diameter; and a vesica formed of two suc h circles is 1,041 across, and 1,041 is the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac contained within the Holy Oblation. FQAS (Phthas), 710 , is the Egyptian Phtha, called by Suidas the Hephaistos of Memphis. The numerical value of his name is equivalent to Pn euma Hagion the Holy Ghost. TUFWN (Typhon) has the value of 2,050 , or about the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The Greeks all affirmed that their knowledge of astronomy was derived from the Egyptians, and an analysis of the numbers attributed to the Hill o f Bat, in the Book of the Dead (bk. ix., ch. cviii.), shows that these statements are not necessarily unfounded, and its measures seem to be the Egyptian prototype of the descriptions of the ark, the temples, and cities found in the Hebrew scrip - tures; f or they anticipate, in a most remarkable manner, the geometrical results obtained from the mystical fabrics of the Bible. “There is the Hill of Bat, the heaven rests on it. It is in the east of the heaven about 370 cubits long, 140 cubits broad. Sabak, Lord of the Bat [cavern] in the east is on the hill in his temple upon its edge. There is a snake on the brow of that hill, about 30 cubits long, 10 cubits broad; 3 cubits in front of him are of stone? [hard]. I know the name of that snake on his hi ll, Eater of Fire is his name.” The parallelogram here ascribed to the Hill of Bat has a perimeter of 1,020 cubits, or nearly the radius of Saturn’s orbit, measured by diameters of the sun. Again, this parallelogram is exactly inclosed by the rhombus, 613 by 354 , described"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"NAMES OF THE GODS. 137 under the names Zeus and Apollo. Further, the square containing the hill has a perimeter of 1,480 cubits (= 370 × 4 ), and 1,480 is the numerical value of the name Christos, and the side of a square contained within the Holy Oblation. Then 370 cubits = 6,660 inches; and 140 cubits = 2,520 inches, and this number is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 7,920 (= 2,520 × 3 1 / 7 ) or the number of miles in the diameter of the earth. The measure of the serpent is 30 × 10 cubits, giving an area of 300 , which is the width of a vesica 520 long, which is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,080 , the si de of the Holy Oblation, and the length of that rhombus is 888 . When converted into feet these measures become 45 × 15 and 45 with a fraction added is the square root of the diameter of Saturn’s orbit, and 15 cubed equals 3,375 the diameter of the moon’ s orbit, and if they are multiplied together they give 675 , or the side of a rhombus 1,170 long. Now, 1,169 1 / 2 is 1 / 1 2 the side of a square, whose area equals the surface of the earth. And 676 is the square of 26 , the number of the Tetrad. Again, 45 feet = 540 inches, and 540 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,160 , or the moon's diameter in miles. It appears, therefore, that this mystical hill, upon which “the heaven rests,” is a figure of the mound, mundus, or world composed of the earth, the seven planets, and the Zodiac. It is universally admitted that the Mohammedan religion was imitated from that of the Hebrews and Christians, and since the scriptures and gospel were acknowledged as sacred books by the prophet himself, the matt er is placed beyond dispute. But it is perhaps not generally known, at least amongst Christians, that the identity of the two systems is quite so close as it appears to be.

For whatever sufferings He under - went . . . . had a figurative meaning and great significance. . . . In his suffering He stretched forth His hands, and measured out the world.” — L ACTANTIUS , “Divine Institutes,” bk. iv., ch. xxvi. S T . C YRIL of Jerusalem, in his fourth lecture, addressed the following words to the Catechumens: “Let us not then be ashamed of the Cross of Christ; but though another hide it do thou openly seal it on thy brow.” The cross, long before the year 350 A.D., when St. Cyril delivered his lectures, had been a mystical emblem among the old pagan races of Egypt and Greece. St. Cyril, if not a Greek by birth, at least wrote in the Greek tongue, and living as he did at Jerusalem, was stationed between the Egyptia n influences of Alexandria on the one hand, and those of Greece on the other. His reference to the custom of concealing the cross probably refers to the Greeks, since the Egyptians had openly displayed the cross as a sacred symbol from the remotest times . Owing to the fact that the Greeks, as implied by St. Cyril, were accustomed to hide the cross, we have very few references to it by the early Greek writers; that of Plato in the “Timæus” is probably the best known, and by its obscurity bears out the su ggestion of concealment. The two figures of Vitruvius already described probably denote the peculiar mysteries attached to the cross by the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 140 Greeks and Romans, while the reverence paid to it by the Christians was apparently no more than the expansion of t he old pagan ideas more openly expressed. Plato’s cross was the saltire, or St. Andrew's cross, like the letter X, and was the shape attributed by him to the Logos. The corre - sponding figure, described by Vitruvius, shows a man with his legs and arms str etched out in this form, so that the tips of his fingers and toes touch the four corners of a circle, having its centre upon the navel or omphalos. The other figure of Vitruvius forms a cross, by stretching his arms out horizontally, so that he measures the same distance across the arms as from head to foot. In some of the earliest works of Christian art, the Christ is represented in this form, standing against a cross, but without any appearance of being nailed to it, and is probably represented acc ording to the old classical manner. 1 In the old Greek market - place, which was the centre or omphalos of the town, there generally stood an upright Hermes to mark the crossing of the two lines, which indicated the four quarters of the universe, and which meet at its centre. The earth, being in the centre of the cosmos, was symbolized by a cross of this kind , , and repre - sented, in the old astronomical system, the om - phalos or navel of the universe. Delphi, as is well known, marked the supposed cross ing of these imaginary lines in Greece, while Jerusalem occupied a similar position in Palestine; and the same practice existed in Egypt, Thebes being an om - phalos in that country. In Italy the Romans called the crossing place the cardo, from which we derive the name, cardinal points. In England we call the middle of our towns simply the cross, and 1 See Mrs. Jameson, “History of our Lord.”"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 141 until comparatively recently, a crucifix or other suitable erection always occupied this position. In the old temples, which were microcosms or little worl ds, there was always an omphalos, although it was not always marked by any archi - tectural feature. In the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the tripod stood over the omphalos, and near the centre of the church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem there is a st one which was called the “Compass of our Lord.” In a Christian cathedral, which is cruciform in plan, the cardo or compass is marked by the crossing of the transepts and nave. Procopius has left us an account of how the plan of a Christian church was la id out in the sixth century. He says: “In ancient times there was one church at Byzantium dedicated to all the Apostles, but through length of time it became ruinous, and seemed not likely to stand much longer. Justinian took this entirely down, and was most careful not only to rebuild it, but to render it more admirable in size and beauty; he carried out his intention in the following manner. Two lines were drawn in the form of a cross, joining one another in the middle, the upright one pointing to the rising and setting sun, and the other cross line towards the north and south wind. These were surrounded by a circuit of walls, and within by columns placed both above and below; at the crossing of the two straight lines, that is, about the middle point of them, there is a place set apart, which may not be entered except by the priests, and which is con - sequently termed the sanctuary. The transepts which lie on each side of this, about the cross line, are of equal length; but that part of the upr ight line towards the setting sun is built so much longer than the other part as to form the figure of the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 142 cross.” — Procopius, “Sacred Buildings of Jus - tinian,” Aubrey Stewart's transl., p. 20 . It is worthy of notice that the method, described here by Procopius, is exactly, similar to that employed by the Roman Augurs, in setting out a Templum. In the latter case, the cross - lines were called Cardo, and Decumanus. We are told by Plato in the “Timæus” that “the Creator compounded the world out of al l the fire, and all the water, and all the air, and all the earth, leaving no part of any of them, nor any power of them outside . . . in the centre, he put the soul. . . . This entire compound he divided lengthways into two parts, which he joined to one another at the centre, like the letter C , 1 and bent them into a circular form, connecting them with themselves and each other at the point opposite their original meeting point.” This cross was a symbol of the Logos, or invisible soul of the world, a nd his body being compounded of the four elements, the size of the cross may be taken to be 2,004 , the numerical value of the four Greek words, PUR , 580 , fire, 'AHR , 109 , air, `UDWR , 1,304 , water, and GH , 11 , earth. The limbs of the cross would therefore measure 1,002 ( 2 004 2 , = 1002 ) . After the Creator had divided the elements into two strips, in the form of a cross, he bent them into two circles one within the other. The circ - umferences of these two circles being 1,002 , their diamete rs would be 318.94 ( 318.94 × 3.1416 = 1,002 ). The two circles, crossing each other thus, are generally thought to refer to the circles of the equator and the ecliptic on the sphere of the world. 1 The letter Chi as a numeral = 600 , which is the numerical equivalent to the word cosmos. And 601 is the width of a vesia, 1,041 2 / 3 long, or the radius of the sphere of the zodia c contained in the Holy Oblation."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 143 And the number 2,004 is the internal length of an ark con taining the ecliptic, measured on a terrestrial globe. Consequently, by the measure of his cross, Plato was enabled indirectly to intro - duce the actual space of the sun’s path, as an attribute of the Logos. If these two circles again be made to form a vesica, the rhombus inscribed within it has a perimeter of 1,275 ( 318.94 × 4 = 1,275.76 ). And 1,276 is the numerical value of the name Achilleus, the hero of the “Iliad.” While the united width of the two circles forming the rhombus is 956.82 , which is 1 and a fraction less than the numerical value of `O 'IHSOUS , 958 , the d ivine Being whose life forms the subject of the gospel. In the oldest representations of the crucifixion, the four elements are constantly depicted at the foot of the cross, while the sun and moon are placed above the two arms. This invariable arrange - me nt exhibits the main features of the cosmos, surrounding the body of the elemental god, pre - figured in the “Timæus.” The elements were represented in the east by three geometrical figures — a square, a circle, and a triangle — surmounted by a crescent the symb ol of the moon, the emblem of the upper region, called Æther, occupied by the planets. The earth was assigned to the square or cube, water and air to the circle or sphere, while the triangle or pyramid was the symbol of fire. This figure is analogous to the cross of the Christians, and may be taken to symbolize the three parts of a man’s body, his head, his middle, and his legs; and the height of his body, being the amount of the moon’s distance from the earth, is a symbol of the measure called the t one. Sanford (De decen. Chri.) tells us that, “by the four children of Chronos, there is supposed to be a"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 144 reference to the first elements of things. By Zeus was understood fire; by Hera, air; by Poseidon, water; and Hades, earth.” The numerical value of these four names is 2,163 , which is exactly the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. The four elements being assigned to the space between the earth and the moon, this measure may be taken to express the whole sublunary world, and to explain the ass ertion of Sandford. The reason for connecting the Logos with the elements, or the interval between the earth and the moon, may be explained thus: the moon being the lowest heaven, a mediating power was required to convey the divine essence, diffused thro ughout the region of the stars, to the earth. The mediator, who personified the vital fluid, was invariably associated with a cross, the symbol of the generative power. And this cross, standing upon the earth, passing through the elements, and reachin g up to heaven, seems to have symbolized the agent of creation in the cosmic system. The early crucifixes always show the upright beam of the cross very much longer than the transverse piece; and seeing that the treatment of the subject, in the hands of the old artists, was reduced to a stereotyped or canonical form, it might be expected that a rule for the proportion of the cross had existed also. The only measure - ments attributed to the cross of Christ which we have been able to find are those given by Sir John Maundeville. In the second chapter of his “Travels,” he says, \"And zee schulle undirstonde, that the Cros of oure Lord was eyght cubytes long, and the overthwart piece was of lengthe thre cubytes and a half.” Now 8 × 3 1 / 2 cubits are equal to 12 × 5 1 / 4 feet, or 144 × 63 inches. In practice the proportions of crucifixes vary, but they keep approximately to this ratio. There is a working"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 145 drawing of a cross, which might establish the exist - ence of a rule among the old craftsmen in making thei r crucifixes, given by Juan de Arphe, a Spanish goldsmith of the sixteenth century, who published a book in 1589 called “Varia Commensuracion para le Escultura y Arquitectura;” this is a pro - cessional cross, with a reliquary forming the lower part of it. Arphe divides the height into eight, and the cross beam measures rather more than 3 3 / 4 of these parts, so it is very nearly of Sir John’s proportion. Dr. Oliver gives a cross, used by the Freemasons, of the proportion of 14 to 5 ; but the clue to the pr oportions of the cross, which has an analogy with the cosmos, is probably to be found in the name “Holy Rood.” It is well known that the crucifix set over the screen, which separated the sanctuary from the nave of a church, was called the Holy Rood, bu t there is no explanation to be found why it was so called. The natural supposi - tion is, that it had some reference to the rood measure and, in fact, we believe that it originated from the proportions of a cross composed of this measure. The rood is a q uarter of an acre, and is com - posed of forty square perches — a perch being 16 1 / 2 feet square — and 40 perches (long measure) make a furlong of 660 feet, containing 7,920 inches, the number of miles in the diameter of the earth. The Iconostasis is, in the Greek church, what we should call the Rood Screen. And `H 'EIKONOSTASIS yields the number 1,144 , which is the length of a vesica 660 wide. And 660 being 1 / 1 2 of 7,920 , it may be taken to represent the diameter of the earth. Now, if the 40 square perc hes com - posing the rood measure be arranged in the form of a cross, as nearly as possible according to Sir John's proportion for the cross of Christ, it will be found that such a cross has a ratio of 28"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 146 to 13 .

And if the greater man of Vitruvius be crucified upon it, so that his arms stretched out occupy the centre of the transverse beam, and the tips of his fingers touch its extremities, then the top of his head will reach to the summit of the sun’s orbit. This may account for the fact that, on the figure of Cesariano, there are a series of rays,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 147 drawn from a point corresponding to the position of the sun, in the said figure. When the lesser man is made to take the place of the greater man , according to the proper proportion, the top of the square inclosing his body is found to be on a line with the top of the cross beam, and his hands occupy a position similar to those of Christ in an ordinary crucifix. Justus Lipsius, in his treatise on the cross, gives an illustration of a man crucified in this manner — his legs being kept in position by two pieces of wood hung from the transverse beam (“De Cruce,” 1593 , p. 117 ). There are many reasons for believing that this method was the canonica l way of crucifying the Logos in the midst of the universe, and that the earlier repre - sentations of the crucifixion were based upon this secret rule, which was traditionally handed down in the early church, and communicated to the craftsmen and freemason s who were employed to manufacture the ecclesiastical ornaments. In the legend of the crucifixion of Christos in the Gospel, we are told that the tragedy took place on the spot called in Hebrew, Golgotha, which means a skull. By later writers it was ca lled a mount, and according to “the tradition” it was the centre of the world. The Hebrew word, BGVLGLT H A (Golgotha), has the value of 475 . And a rood cross 475 high will crucify a man whose body is inclosed by a circle equal to the sun’s orbit. For if the upright beam measure 475 , by the ratio of 28 to 13 the transverse beam will measure 220 , which is the diameter of the sun’s orbit. And the extreme length of the cross being 678 , we get the length of the orbit, com - puting the diameter at 216 ( 2 16 x 3 1 / 7 = 678 ). Golgotha was also spelt without the Β , and consequently yields the number 473 ; and 473 is the side of a pentalpha having a perimeter of 2,368 ,"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 148 the numerical value of the name 'IHSOUS CRISTOS . It is also spelt GLGL T H A, 467 - 1 = 466 : and a cross whose height is 466 has some very remark - able cosmic analogies. Its transverse beam is 216 , or the diameter of the sun’s orbit measured by its own diameter. Its extreme measure is 666 , the length of the sun’s ark. From the bottom to the cen tre of the cross beam is 358 , the number of the name Messiah, while the height to the top of the cross beam is 366 2 / 3 . And 466 is the side of a square having a diagonal of 660 , 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s diameter in miles. This may explain the tra - dition tha t Golgotha, 467 , was in the middle of the earth. A cross of the proportion of 28 to 13 , having an area equal to a rood, is ( 28 × 16 1 / 1 2 =) 462 feet high, while the transverse beam is ( 13 × 16 1 / 2 =) 214 1 / 2 , and its full extent being 660 feet, it measures the diameter of the earth. There is no reason to doubt that the early Christians regarded the cross, in its symbolical sense, otherwise than the rest of mankind, and it appears to be used by Sir John Maundeville according to the ordinary mystical acceptat ion. Accordingly, the length of a cross (and we have seen that Sir John describes the cross of Christ as being 144 inches high) affords a means of measuring a man's body; now by the proportion of the lesser figure of Cesariano, 144 × 9 1 / 2 = 1,368 , and 1,368 is the width of a rhombus 2,368 ( 'IHSOUS CRISTOS ) long. Therefore Sir John's measure is equivalent to the number 249 1 / 4 ( 248 + 1 ), recorded in the Cabala, “Greater Holy Assembly,” par. 968 . If the lesser man of Vitruvius be cruci fied on a rood cross, in a square whose diagonals are 1,002 ( 1,002 × 2 = 2,004 , the numerical value of the four elements), the height of the cross will be 2,156 , the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 149 mean number between 2,151 and 2,160 , the number of miles in the moon's diameter. A more accurate measure of the moon's diameter is 2,162.44 , and the transverse beam of a cross 2,162.44 is 1,004 , the numerical value of the name Dionysus, who was identified with the Logos by the Greeks and Christians, and whose rites constituted the mys - teri ous knowledge of the old Greek architects, called Dionysiacs. The numbers deduced from the Hebrew names of the elements, like those of the Greeks, set forth the distance between the earth and the moon, as well as the altitude of the ecliptic; for AS H , 301 , RVC H , 214 , MIM, 90 , and OPR, 350 , amount to 955 . And a vesica 956.769 broad is 1,658 long, and 1,658 is equal to the moon's distance in miles divided by 12 twice ( 12 828 238 , = 12 902 19 , = 1,658 ). Again, the length of a ve sica 955.38 broad is 1,656 , the number of miles from the equator to the tropics, measured on the earth's circumference ( 69 × 24 = 1,656 ). And a rood cross which measures 1,657 , the mean number between 1,656 and 1,658 , contains three measures, found in the names of the hypo - thetical being, deified by the ancients. A cross 1,657 high measures 2,367.12 in its full extent, wh ich may be taken at 2,368 , the value of the name 'IHSOUS CRISTOS . The cross beam measures 769.314 , which is nearly the circumference of a circle having a diameter of 245 ( 245 × 3.1416 = 769.682 ), the value of the Hebrew Adam Kadmon, while a vesica 769.31 4 long is 443.835 broad, and 443 is the numerical value of `O LOGOS , The Word. If we may accept the authority of Sir Thomas Browne, the cross seen by the Emperor Constantine in his vision was a quincunx, that is to say, the saltire of five points. The i nscription on the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 150 Labarum, or standard, was “ 'EN TOUTO NIKA ,” “In this thou shalt conquer.” Now, the numerical value of these three Greek words is 1,276 , a number which is a fraction less than the height of a rood cross capable of crucifying a man whose body is inclosed by a square having a perimeter of 2,368 , the numerical value of Iesous Christos . The Latin version of the inscription was “In hoc vince,” and it yields the number 212 , if the letters be computed according to the Hebrew valuation ( 60 + 78 + 74 = 212 ). Now 212 is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 666 , and that number, being the diameter of another circle whose circumference is 2,092.3 , represents the diameter of the sphere of the Zodiac, containing the square 1,480 (Chris tos). Therefore the translation has transferred to the Latin the meaning, as well as the words, of the original, for the circle of the Zodiac bears the mystical ratio of 9 1 / 2 to 1 to the sun's orbit ( 220 x 9 1 / 2 = 2,090 ), and thus expresses the hidden sig nificance of the cross. The name Labarum does not appear in classical Latin. It was presumably invented by the Chris - tians, and has a value of 840 , according to the Hebrew value of the letters, which makes it by Gematria equivalent to Microcosmos. The num ber 1,276 , 1 therefore, unites the cross of the “Timæus” with that of Jesus Christ, and was an appropriate number to be borne upon the standard of the pagan Emperor who became a convert to Chris - tianity, and was the first imperial supporter of the new cult . The diagonal of a square whose sides are 901 is 1,275 , and the number 901 is the numerical equiva - lent of Ð fallÒj . Since the Hebrew word T H BH , 407 (Ark), is equivalent by Gematria to T H V, 406 1 It is a peculiarity of the number 1,275 , that it is the dia - meter of a circle the length of whose circumference is twice 2,004 , the numerical value of the names of the elements."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 151 (Tau), and since 4 o 6 is the diameter of a circle whose cir cumference is 1,276 , or the height of a rood cross which will crucify a man within a square whose sides are 2,368 (Jesus Christ), there seems to be good reason for accepting the testimony of St. Clement, that the sun’s ark and the cross were used synony mously. In the dimensions attributed to the ark, 300 is equivalent to Tau, and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 50 is 1,276 , and from 1 to 30 , 465 , or 1 less than 466 . The word `HLIOS (Sun) has the value of 318 , and by transposing the numerals, it may be come 831 ( fallÒj ). A curious commentary on this mystical number occurs in the Epistle of Barnabas (ch. ix.): “For Scripture says, that Abraham cir - cumcised 318 men of his house. But what was the mystery that was made known unto him? Mark, first, the 1 8 , and next, the 300 . For the numerical letters of 10 and 8 are IH . And these denote 'IH ( SOUS ), Jesus. And because the cross was that by which we were to find grace, there - fore he adds 300 ; the note of which is T (the figure of his cross).

No one has learned a more genuine word from me than this, but I know that ye are worthy of it.” The genuine word of Barnabas may be explained thus: the word staurÒj (cross) has the value of 1,271 , and 1,272 is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 318 . And it has just been shown that the circles formed from the limbs of Plato’s cross were 318.94 in diameter.

Again, 318 is the diameter of the two circles which produce a vesica 666 in circumference. Lastly, the circumference of a circle 318 in diameter is 99.9028 , and 99.975 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 3,999 , the sum of the num - bers deduced from the twenty - four letters of the Greek alphabet — a fact which may account for the name Logos (speech) being applied to the Microcosm. The commentary of the Rabbis on the circum - cision of the 318 members of Abraham’s house - hold is quite as curio us as that of Barnabas. The name of Eliezer (ALIOZR), Abraham's steward, has the value of 318 . “Now, say the Jews, the numerical letters of Eliezer, making just 318 , the number of servants which Abraham armed, we learn hence that Abraham did the busine ss, and got the victory with Eliezer alone, who was equal to all of them, and that he left the rest at home” (Jeremiah Jones’ “Canon of New Testament,” vol. ii., p. 386 ). The cruciform Man being double - sexed and being composed of soul and body, his soul or mas - culine half was diffused through the Æther, that is, the Zodiac and seven planets, while it was his body, which was feminine or material, that properly belonged to the elements. Therefore, since the complete Being, male and female, represented the two lower divisions of the cosmos, the numbers with"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 153 which he was identified connected his body with the ascertained measures of the sun and the planet - ary system as well as the moon and the elements. And this double nature had its counterpart in the two limbs of the cross. There can be little doubt that the cosmic signi - ficance of the cross was acknowledged in Greece long before the time of Plato. 1 For instance, the name ΟΡΦΕΥΣ has the value of 1,275 , and the mysterious doctrines of the Orphic system pr esumably had reference to the cross. At any rate, in the earliest efforts of Christian Art, it is not uncommon to find Christos depicted playing upon a lyre in the character of Orpheus. No reason is known for this singular impersonation, but the number 1,2 75 , deduced from the name Orpheus, suggests the reason why the two gods had a similar identity. 'ACILLEUS , 1,276 , and 'ODUSSEUS , 1,479 , the heroes of the two Homeric poems which formed the Bible of the Greeks, were apparently regarded as personifications o f the Logos, for if 1 is subtracted from 1,276 and is added to 1,479 , we get the numbers 1,275 and 1,480 — the first being equi - valent to 2,368 (Jesus Christ), and the latter being the exact value of the name Christos. And 'O TRIPTOLEMOS , a kindred deit y, has the value of 1,275 ; without the article and with the addition of colel the name yields 1,206 1 / 2 , the side of a vesica 2,093 long. Plato declared that the moon received her light from the sun. He may have had a further geo - metrical reason for saying this than that already suggested, for a rood cross 666 high has a trans - verse beam 309 ( `H SELHNH ) long, consequently the sides of the square which encloses the lesser 1 See Schlieman, “Ilios,” p. 349 , etc."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 154 man, crucified on such a cross, measure nearly 220 , the diameter of the sun's orbit , and the fact that the ark, a symbol analogous to the cross, 1 was re - garded by the old mythologists as a type of the moon, may have had something to do with the above numbers. Hippolytus (“Refut.,” bk. iv., ch. xliv.), continu - ing an account of the Egy ptian theory of numbers as applied to the nature of God, says: “And moreover they make this assertion, that they have cal - culated the word QEION , deity, and found that it reverts into a pentad with an ennead subtracted. Now this name is an even number, a nd when it is written down they attach it to the body and ac - complish cures by it.” Servius, on the Eclogues of Virgil (viii. 75 ), and Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxxviii. 2 ), make similar statements. The numerical value of the word QEION is 144 , and 144 - 9 = 1 35 , and if 135 be converted into a pentad, we get ( 135 × 5 =) 675 , or 1 less than the square of 26 , the mystical vesica. What they appear to mean is, that the particular aspect of the deity for working cures may be symbolized by a combination of the cr oss and the vesica. It is unlikely that the conjunction of the names Rose and Cross, as the emblem of the Rosicrucian order, was an accidental circumstance arrived at without reason. In Greek the words yield, Rodon 294 and Stauros 1,271 ; and the sum of th e two numbers is 1,565 . Now, if 2 be deducted, there remains 1,563 , which is the length of a vesica 901 broad, and got is the side of a square whose diagonals are 1,275 , the height of a rood cross which will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . And 1,565 is the perimeter of a rhombus 678 long, or the extent of the sun’s 1 See p. 78 ."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROOD. 155 orbit. Again, 1,565 is the perimeter of a triangle whose sides are 521 , a quarter of the side of the Holy Oblation. Finally, 1,565 is the circumference of a circle 495 in diameter, a number which is 1 less than the numerical value of Malchuth, the Bride, and is 1 / 1 6 of the earth's diameter in miles. The numerical value of the name fallÒj is 831 , and a cross 831 high has a transverse beam 385.71 long, and its full exte nt is 1,186.8 . It has already been pointed out that the number 831 1 / 2 gives the height of a man, equal to the polar diameter of the earth in miles. But that is not the only cosmic measure to be observed in this cross. For the transverse beam is about th e sun's distance, com - puted by the tone, and the extreme measure is the length of a vesica whose width is 684.6 , the diameter of a circle 2,151 in circumference, or the number of years occupied by the sun in each of the signs during the period of the pre cession of the equinoxes, or Great Year. Again, 831 is the numerical equivalent of Macrocosmos, who was also called by the cabalists Macroprosopos, Long Face. The value of the latter name is 1 , 101 , and a cross 1,101.688 high will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,046 ( 511 1 / 2 × 4 ), the diameter of Saturn's orbit. The sum of the numbers of Macroprosopos and Microprosopos is 2,211 , or the length of a rhombus 1,275 broad. And 1,275 is the height of a cross which will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . Again, a cross which is 248 1 high has a trans - verse beam 115.05 long, and measures 354 over all. The diameter of a circle 360 in circumference being 114.59 , this cross roughly combines in its measures the length of the solar and lunar years, 1 See “Greater Holy Assembly,” par. 968 ."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 156 and thus acquires a masculine and feminine signi - ficance. Consequently it expresses the twofold character of the symbol, exemplified by the fact that Stauros and Omphalos are equal to one another by Gematria. The height of a cross whose transverse beam exactly measures t he diameter of a circle 360 in circumference, is 246.792 , or in a round number, 247 ; and this is equivalent to the name QHRION , the Beast of the Apocalypse. Since there is an allusion in the text to the Beast’s name, it may be supposed that some mystery lies in the word. It was certainly the received opinion, that the Beast’s mark was the cross, so the mystery may have had reference to the figure of the Microcosm crucified in a circle having a circumference of 360 , the number of degrees in the earth’ s circuit. Finally, if the Logos be crucified, saltirewise, so that his body measures 666 ( 333 × 2 ), the square which contains him is 236 on each of its sides — the measure of the New Jerusalem — then the extreme measure of the cross is 1,024.63 , the radius of Saturn's orbit; while the height of the cross is 717.248 , or a third of 2,151 , the number of years in the Great Month. And the square enclosing this cross ( 717 × 4 ) has a perimeter of 2,868 , the sum of the numbers deduced from the names of the ten c abalistic steps, the canonical synthesis of the Jewish theology.

I T is written that the sons of Noah journeyed from the east to the land of Shinar, and having setttled to dwell there, they said, “Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” But the Elohim were displeased with the children of men, saying also, “Go to, let us go dow n, and there confound their language” (Genesis, xi. 4 - 7 ). Henceforth on this account the place was called Babel ( BBL ), which has the numerical value of 34 , the square root of 1,156 . Now 1,156 is the length of a vesica 2,004 long, and 2,004 is the numeri cal value of the four Greek names of the elements. The fall of the Tower of Babel commemorates to the believer the dispersal of mankind through - out the world and the origin of many languages. The Freemasons also connected the building of this tower w ith the origin of architecture. And after the confusion of tongues, new alphabets must obviously have been invented, so it was also associated with the institution of letters. Kircher, who of all late writers has preserved the most detailed account of t he old mysticism, depicts the Tower (“Turris Babel,” p. 38 ) as reaching up"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 158 to the moon, the lowest heaven, a distance of 238,828 miles, or, as he measures it, 52 semi - diameters of the earth. It is not related that the builders succeeded in their prepost erous attempt, nor is it credible that any race of madmen could ever have projected or commenced such a work; but that does not prevent our assuming that the fable may have some point. It is clear that the myth - writers have made the attempt to span the distance from the earth to the moon, coin - cident with the commencement of all earthly languages, so that by joining this astronomical invention with the formation of new alphabets and words, the story may be a metaphorical intimation of the first bes towal of cosmic values upon names. If that were so, the Freemasons would obviously see in such a fable the conse - quent beginning of that practice in building which made a temple, like a name, an imitation of the universe, and, more particularly, that pa rt of the universe symbolized by the Logos composed of the elements. And since the Tower, if it had been completed, would have accurately measured the sublunary world, the languages of the dis - persed nations are probably contrasted with the divine lan guage of the Elohim, which was spoken in the heavens above. In Paradise Hebrew was the only language known; Noah also, whose ark has been supposed to represent the Zodiac and seven planets, knew no other, and it was not till the building and collapse of the Elemental Tower, that the speech of the gods was dispersed to the four corners of the earth. The other mysteries underlying the myth need not concern us. But it may be said, in a word, that the allegory describes the speech of Macrocosmos and M icrocosmos being conveyed to Basileia."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 159 The next important structure, erected by the Jews, was the Tabernacle, or Tent of Tetragram - maton. Though trifling in size, being neither comparable in its accommodation to the Ark, nor to the Towel of Babel in hei ght, it has great interest, as being the first Hebrew shrine or temple of which there is any description in the Canonical Scriptures. We learn from Philo Judaeus that Moses “Speedily learnt arithmetic, and geometry, and the whole science of rhythm, a nd harmony and metre, and the whole of music by means of the use of musical instruments, and by lectures on the different arts, and by explana - tions of each; and lessons on these subjects were given him by Egyptian philosophers, who also taught him the philosophy which is contained in symbols, which they exhibit in those sacred characters or hieroglyphics, as they are called, and also that philosophy which is conversant about that respect which they pay to animals which they invest with the honours d ue to God. “All other branches of the encyclical education he learned from the Greeks; 1 and the philosophers from the, adjacent countries taught him Assyrian literature, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, so much studied by the Chaldæans. And th is knowledge he derived also from the Egyptians, who study mathematics above all things, and he learnt with great accuracy the state of that art among both Chaldaeans and Egyptians, making 1 The Fathers, as we have seen, all declared that th e Greeks learnt their philosophy from Moses, but it is remarkable that his earliest biographer should exactly reverse the position. The importance of Philo’s statement is enormous, from its implica - tion of Hellenic influences having affected the Hebrew Scrip - tures, producing the alleged agreement between the writings of the two peoples.

All this knowledge was said to be contained in the five books of Moses, and the Ark, Camp, and Tabernacle are the embodiment of the mathe - matical and astronomical part of it. Besides the account in the Scriptures, the Tabernacle is fully described by Philo, Josephus, and Clement of Alexandria; in recent times Sir William Drum - mond (“Œdipus Judaicus,” 1811 , p. 119 ) has pointed out all that can be said in a general way, as to the cosmic symbolism of the Tabernacle and Temple. From all these sources it is made evident that this structure was a mystical image of the universe, intended as a shrine for the Pantheistic deity, whose nature is enigmatically shadowed forth in the Law. Moses, we are told , “having gone up into the loftiest and most sacred mountain in the district . . . which was very difficult of access and very hard to ascend,” was there “initiated into the sacred will of God,” and received the pattern from which the Tabernacle was to be built, and all the measures of its parts. The court, in which the tent was set up, was 100 cubits long, by 50 cubits broad. The vesica containing this parallel - ogram is 83 × 144 , and the circumference of the two circles from which it is produced is 521 , the side of a rhombus 2,081 in circuit. It has been already pointed out that 144 × 9 1 / 2 = 1,368 , the side of vesica 2,368 long. Then if the court be surrounded by a rhom bus, its sides are 107.55 , say 108 , the radius of the sun’s orbit. The Tabernacle itself was placed in the court towards the west, but with its front to the east, that,”when the sun arose it might send its first rays upon it” (Josephus). Its measures ar e"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 161 30 cubits = 45 feet = 540 inches by 10 cubits = 15 feet = 180 in. Now the moon’s distance is 30 diameters of the earth; and to may be taken to be the sun’s radius. Then 45 , with the addition of a fraction, is the square root of the diameter of Sat urn’s orbit measured by the diameter of the sun. The number 15 is, in round numbers, the square root of 3,960 , the number of miles in the earth’s radius, and is the width of the mystical vesica, 26 to 15 . The length of the Holy Place is 360 inches, a nd its perimeter is 1,080 inches, the radius of the moon's diameter in miles. While the perimeter of the whole tent is 1,440 , or 6 less than the diagonal of the square contained in the mean orbit of Saturn measured by the diameter of the sun. The bui lding is formed of three cubes; a double cube being assigned to the Holy Place, and a cube to the Holy of Holies. Now the Holy of Holies is 15 feet square, and 15 cubed = 3,375 feet, or the diameter of the moon's orbit twice divided by 12 ( 12 567 485 , = 12 464 40 , = 3,372 ) . And the Holy Place contains 6,750 cubic feet. Josephus says that “this proportion of the measures of the Tabernacle proved to be an imitation of the system of the world” (“Antiq.,” bk. vi., chap. vi. ). If it be open to question whether the preceding measures relate to the structure of the universe, there can, at least, be no doubt that the furniture of this mystical shrine is symbolical of the heavenly order. In the Holy Place there stood on the n orth side a table “like those at Delphi” (Jose - phus), upon which were laced twelve loaves, arranged in two heaps of six each, typical of the twelve months of the year. And opposite the table, on the south side, stood the golden candle - stick having seven branches, which “carried seven"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 162 lamps, one by one, in imitation of the number of the planets” (Josephus, “Antiq.,” bk. iii., chap. vi.). And the candlestick was set obliquely, like the ecliptic ( ibid .). “The altar of incense was placed in the middle, between earth and water, as a symbol of gratitude which it was fitting should be offered up on account of things that had been done for the Hebrews on both these elements, for these elements have had the central situation of the world allotted to them. The candlestick was placed on the southern side of the Tabernacle, since by it the maker intimates, in a figurative manner, the motions of the stars, which give light; for the sun and the moon, and the rest of the stars, being all at a great distance from the northern parts of the universe, make all their revolutions in the south. And from this candles - tick there proceeded six branches, three on each side, projecting from the candlestick in the centre, so as altogether to complete the number seven; and in all the seven there were seven candles, and seven lights, being symbols of those seven stars, which are called planets by those men who are versed in natural philosophy; for the sun, like the candlestick, being placed in the middle of the other six, i n the fourth rank, gives light to the three planets which are above him, and to those of equal number which are below him, adapting to circumstances the musical and truly divine instru - ments. . . . For the symbols of heaven and earth are placed side by side, as the Holy Scripture shows, the candlestick being the symbol of heaven, and that which is truly called the altar of incense, on which all the fumigator), offerings are made, being emblems of things of earth\" (Philo, “Life of Moses,” bk. iii.). C lement of Alexandria considered both the altar of incense and the table to be symbols of the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 163 earth. He says, “But the table, as I think, signi - fies the image of the earth; it is sustained by four feet, answering to the summer, autumn, spring, and winter , by which the year proceeds” (“Miscell.,” bk. vi., chap. ix.). He also says, “the golden lamp conveys another enigma, as a symbol of Christ” (bk. vi., chap. vi.), alluding apparently to the number 1,480 , which is the measure of the whole planetary sys tem. The most sacred and mysterious object of the Tabernacle was the Ark, containing the two stones of the Law. It measured 2 1 / 2 cubits long or 3 3 / 4 feet, or 45 inches; its breadth and height were 1 1 / 2 cubits, or 2 1 / 4 feet, or 27 inches. Its perimeter was therefore the mystic number of 144 inches. If the Ark were rather more than an inch thick, which would be sufficient for a box of this size, its contents would amount to 24,860 cubic inches, or the number of miles in the circumference of the earth . The Tables of the Law preserved in the Ark appear to have had a cosmic significance, for Clement of Alexandria, speaking of the Decalogue, says that “ten is a sacred number, it is superfluous now to say. And if the Tables which were written were the wor k of God, they will be found to exhibit physical creation. For by the ‘finger of God’ is understood the power of God, by which the creation of heaven and earth is accomplished; both of which the Tables will be understood to be symbols. For the writing and handiwork put on the Table is the creation of the world. And the Decalogue, viewed as an image of heaven, em - braces sun, moon, and stars, clouds, light, wind, water, air, darkness, fire. This is the physical decalogue of the heaven.

Nor are the Ark, with the two stones of the Law, and the Schekinah above it without a meaning, but it was thought fit to conceal the real import of all these symbols for reasons given by Origen: “I might have men - tioned what is said of those beings which are called seraphim by the Hebrews, and described in Is aiah, who cover the face and feet of God, and of those called cherubim, whom Ezekiel has described, and the postures of these, and of the manner in which God is said to be borne upon the cherubim. But since they are mentioned in a very mysterious manner, on account of the unworthy and the in - decent, who are unable to enter into the great thoughts and venerable nature of theology, I have not deemed it becoming to discourse of them in this treatise” (“Against Celsus,” bk. vi., ch. xviii.). Before the door of the Holy of Holies was the veil symbolizing the four elements. The holy place, 360 inches long, the number of degrees in the earth's circumference, symbolized the mystic ship, which measured the sun's course, and corres - ponds to the Naos ( naÒj ) of a Greek temple or nave (navis) of a Christian church. Thus the mystic triad, the ancient emblem of God, invisibly ordered the proportions of this sacred tent (see Arius Montanus, “Antiq. Jud.,” Plate G). The name of the Tabernacle in the Hebrew (Ex. xxv . 9 ) is MS H KN , and yields 1,060 , one less than the length of a vesica 612 broad, two numbers which are found in the names Apollo and"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 166 Zeus — 612 being the perimeter of a square en - closed in the sun's orbit. The number 1,060 is also the diagonal of a square whose sides are 749 1 / 2 , and this square is contained within a rhombus inscribed in Saturn's orbit. By counting the final N as 50 , we get 410 , one and a fraction more than the length of a vesica 236 broad, the side of the New Jerusalem. The word AHL, 3 6 , was also applied to the tent, and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 36 equals 666 . The Ark was called ARUN, 907 , or 257 if the final N be taken at 50 . Now 908 is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 227 , which, multiplied by 9 1 / 2 gives 2,156 , the mean number between 2,151 and 2,161 . And 257 + colel = 258 , which is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 811 , a number already discussed under the name I AO . The name Moses given to the leader of the Israelites, and the builder of the Tabernacle yields 345 ( MS H H ). Now 345 is at once the diameter of a circle whose circumference equals the moon's radius ( 345 × 3 1 / 7 = 1,084 ), and is half the length of the sun’s orbit, and consequently measures half the year, or the interval between the equinoxes ( 345 × 2 = 690 = 220 × 3 1 / 7 ). Then if colel be added 345 + 1 = 346 , which is the length of a vesica 200 broad, the side of the New Jerusalem; and 346 x 6 = 2,076 , or 1 / 1 2 of the earth's circumference. Further, by Gematria the name Moses is e quivalent to Shiloh ( S H ILH , 345 ), which was regarded as a prophetic name of the Messiah (Gen. xlix.). Moses, according to the Talmud, was 10 ells high. Taking the ell at 3 feet 9 inches, his height would be 37 1 / 2 feet, or 450 inches. A square whose sid es are 450 contains a figure of the Logos, measuring 635 1 / 2 × 2 = 1,271 , the numerical value of the word Stauros, the symbol of the Messiah. Again 37 is the square root of 1,369 , the width of a rhombus"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 167 2,368 long. And Moses was born, according to the Hebrew and Samaritan chronologies, in the year of the world 2 ,368 , the numerical value of the name Jesus Christ (Kircher, “Œdip.,” tom. ii., par. 2 , p. 270 ). The craftsmen who were engaged in the construc - tion of the Tabernacle were Bezaleel ( BT Z LAL ), 153 , and Aholiab (AHLIAB), 49 . The first number, 153 , is the s ide of the square contained within the sun’s orbit, and has a perimeter of 612 ; the second number, 49 , may be taken to represent 48 2 / 3 , the square root of 2,368 . Without attempt - ing to expound the allegory of Moses’ life, it is sufficient to infer from the preceding numbers that Moses was conceived as an incarnation of the Messiah, created by the myth - writer in the semblance of a historical personage, exactly parallel to the heroes of the Greek traditions, or the saints of the Christian church. Follo wing the description of the Tabernacle is the account of the vestments of Aaron, the High Priest. The symbolical meaning of these garments harmonizes with the cosmic significance of the shrine, in which it was the duty of the high priest to minister. W e are told by Philo, that the priestly dress “in its whole is a copy and representation of the world; and the parts are a representation of the world” (“Life of Moses,” bk. iii., c. xii.). “The High Priest, then, being equipped in this way, is properly prepared for the performance of all sacred ceremonies, that, whenever he enters the temple to offer up the prayers and sacrifices in use among his nation, all the world may likewise enter in with him, by means of the imitations of it which he bears abou t him, the garment reaching to his feet being the imitation of the air, the pomegranate of the water, the flowery hem of the earth, and the scarlet dye of his robe being the emblem of fire” ( Ibid ., c. xiii.)."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 168 And Josephus summarizes the import of the robe s and their ornaments thus: “Now the vest - ment of the High Priest being made of linen, signified the earth; the blue denoted the sky, being like lightning in its pomegranates, and in the noise of the bells resembling thunder. And for the ephod, it sho wed that God had made the universe of four [elements]; and as for the gold interwoven, I suppose it related to the splendour by which all things are enlightened. He also appointed the breastplate to be placed in the middle of the ephod, to resemble the earth, for that has the very middle place of the world. And the girdle which encompassed the High Priest round, signified the ocean, for that goes round about and includes the universe. Each of the sardonyxes declares to us the sun and moon, those, I mean, that were in the nature of buttons on the High Priest’s shoulders. And for the twelve stones, whether we understand by them the months, or whether we understand the like number of the signs of that circle which the Greeks call the Zodiac, we s hall not be mistaken in their meaning. And for the mitre, which was of a blue colour, it seems to me to mean heaven; for how otherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it?” (“Antiquities,” bk. iii., c. vii.). Philo’s account substantially agrees w ith this, but he adds that the long robe reaching down to the feet, with a fringe of pomegranates, flowers, and bells, exhibits the emblems of the three elements, air, water, and earth. There were 360 bells, which were a type of the year, according t o St. Clement. The twelve stones on the breast - plate, called the Logeion by Philo, were set in four rows, to distinguish the four seasons of the year.

It is noticeable that t his Jew’s ideas as to the Logos are exactly those, afterwards formulated by the Christians. The Logeion or breastplate is called by Josephus 'Esshnh , 471 . And 471 is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 1,480 , the numerical value of the name Christos. The name logeion , 238 , has numerically the same mean - ing, for 238 1 / 2 is the diameter of a circle 749 1 / 2 in circumference, and 749 1 / 2 is the side of a square enclosed by a rhombus inscribed within Saturn’s orbit. Therefore the Logeion exhibits the Christ or Logos in the midst of the twelve signs sym - bolized by the twelve precious stones. The mystic inscription on the Mitre, QDNS H LIHVH, “Holiness to the Lord,” has the value of 510 , and is one and a half less than the side of a rhombus whose p erimeter is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The altar of the Tabernacle was 5 cubits broad by 5 cubits long, by 3 cubits high, which is equal to 7 1 / 2 × 7 1 / 2 × 4 1 / 2 feet, or 90 × 90 × 54 inches.

In the “Ion” of Euripides mention is made of a tent or tabernacle at Delphi, whose area was 10,000 feet. If this tent were built of the pro - portions of the Hebrew Tabernacle, its width would be 57.74 , and its length 173.22 feet ( 57.74 × 3 = 173.2 ), giving an area of 10,001 sq. feet. Its perimeter would consequently be 462 (actually 461.92 ) the height of the cross of the holy rood, whose extreme measure is 660 . The length of the tent would be 2,078.64 , or the mean number between the side of the Holy Oblation and 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s circumference. The perimeter of the Holy of Holies would be almost 230.96 feet, which is the side of a square whose diagonals measure 651 , the diameter of a circle 2,046 in circumference; and 230 1 / 4 × 4 = 921 , the numerical equivalent of the word kanèn (Canon). The perimeter of the Holy Place would be 346.44 , which is the length of a vesica 200 broad, and 200 is the side of the cube of the New Jerusalem. Then a square contain - ing the whole building would have a perimeter of 692 ( 220 × 3 1 / 7 = 691 ), the length of the sun’s orbit. The description of the Temple built by Solomon, the King, is less minute than that of the Tabernacle, but the principal measurements are given without ambiguity. The oldest plan which has any serious pretensi ons to accuracy, is that of Villalpanda, the Jesuit (“In Ezekielem Explanationes,” 1596 ). It is, in fact, thoroughly workmanlike and practical, and has all the appearance of being a copy from some traditional drawing, probably preserved by the old Free masons. According to all information at present available, there is no reason to suppose that the Temple of Solomon ever existed as a"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 171 building. Like all the other fabrics of the Old Testament, it seems to be a purely theoretical structure, described as the canonical pattern for the guidance of architects, in the design of real temples or churches. If it were ever actually built, a glance at the plan will show that it must have been a very substantial work, its main walls being 9 feet thick; such a bu ilding would neces - sarily require considerable foundations, and, if they exist at Jerusalem, it would be easy to recognize them, since all the measurements of the building are known. However, until actual traces of its walls are brought to light, it ma y be reasonably supposed that its description has a place among the canonical books for the same mystical reason that the ark of Noah, the Tower of Babel, the Tabernacle, and the Holy Oblation are found there. The legends connected with the constructio n of the Temple are certainly not in favour of its having had an earthly origin, as the following story from the Talmud clearly shows. “And the house, when it was building, was built of stone, made ready before it was brought thither. Far before the operations commenced, Solomon asked the Rabbis, ‘How shall I accomplish this, without using tools of iron?’ And they, remembering of an insect, which had existed since the creation of the world, whose powers were such as the hardest substances could no t resist, replied, ‘There is the Shameer, with which Moses cut the precious stones of the ephod.’ Solomon asked, ‘And where, pray, is the Shameer to be found?’ To which they made answer, ‘Let a male demon, and a female come, and do thou coerce them both ; mayhap they know and will reveal it to thee.’ He then conjured into his presence a male and female demon, and proceeded to torture them, but in vain,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 172 for, said they, ‘We know not its whereabouts and cannot tell; perhaps Ashmedai, the king of the demon s, knows.’ On being further interrogated, as to where he in turn might be found, they made this answer: ‘In yonder mount is his residence, there he has dug a pit, and after filling it with water, covered it over with a stone and sealed it with his ow n seal. Daily he ascends to heaven and studies in the school of wisdom there, then he comes down and studies in the school of wisdom here; upon which, he goes and examines the seal, then opens the pit, and, after quenching his thirst, covers it up again, reseals it and takes his de - parture.’ “Solomon thereupon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, provided with a magic chain and ring, upon both of which the name of God was en - graved. He also provided him with a fleece of wool, and sundry skins with wine . Then Benaiah went and sank a pit below that of Ashmedai, by means of which the pit was filled with the wine he brought. After levelling the ground, so as not to rouse suspicion, he withdrew to a tree close by to watch the result. After a while Ashmeda i came and examined the seal, when, seeing it all right, he raised the stone, and to his surprise found wine in the pit. For a time he stood muttering, it is written, ‘Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not w ise;’ but, being thirsty, he could not long resist the temptation. He proceeded to drink, therefore, when becoming intoxicated, he lay down to sleep. Then Benaiah came forth from his ambush, and, stealthily approaching, fastened the chain round the sl eeper’s neck. Ashmedai, when he awoke, began to fret and fume, and would have torn off the chain that bound hint, had not Benaiah warned him, saying, ‘The name of the Lord is upon thee.’"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 173 Having thus secured him, Benaiah proceeded to lead him away to his sovereign master. “On arriving at the royal city, he was in due course introduced to the king; when, measuring off four cubits on the floor with the stick he held in his hand, he said to Solomon: ‘When thou diest thou wilt not possess in the world (he r eferred to the grave) more than four cubits of earth. Meanwhile thou hast conquered the world, yet thou art not satisfied until thou hadst overcome me also.’ To this the king quietly replied: ‘I want nothing of thee, but I wish to build the Temple, a nd have need of the Shameer.’ To which Ashmedai at once answered: ‘The Shameer is not committed in charge to me, but to the prince of the sea, and he entrusts it to no one except the great wild cock, and that upon oath that he return it to him again.’ Whereupon Solomon asked, ‘And what does the wild cock do with the Shameer?’ To which the demon replied: ‘He takes it to a barren rocky mountain, and by means of it he cleaves the mountain asunder, into the cleft of which, formed into a valley, he dr ops the seeds of various plants and trees, and thus the place becomes clothed with verdure and fit for habitation.’ This is the Shameer (Levit. ix. 19 ), Nagger Tura, which the Targum renders moun - tain splitter. 1 “They therefore searched for the nest of the wild cock, which they found contained a young brood. This they covered with a glass, that the bird might see its young but not be able to get at them. When, accordingly, the bird came and found his nest impenetrably glazed over, he went and fetch ed the Shameer.

The cock thereupon went and strangled himself, because he was unable to keep the oath by which he had bound himself to return the Shameer. “Having once acquired a power over Ashmedai, Solomon detained him till the building of the Temple was completed.” A tem ple constructed without iron tools, and by means of an insect whose powers were such as the hardest substances could not resist, must have obviously been a structure of no ordinary kind. And when we find that the Freemasons, whose ritual chiefly revolve s round the building of this mysterious fabric, regarded it as a peculiar symbol, rather than a real building, we cannot be altogether wrong in adopting their view. Solomon, too, was no less extraordinary, and according to all the legends about him, was exactly the kind of prince who would build such a remarkable temple; for his splendour and riches were so great, that he made gold and silver as common in Jerusalem as stones in the streets. The name Solomon ( S H LMH ) has the numerical value of 375 , a nu mber which is at once the side of the city of Ezekiel, and the width of a vesica 651 long, and 651 is the diameter of a circle having a circum - ference equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The rabbis declare that certain horses were kept in the court of the Temple, and that they were every morning harnessed to the chariots dedicated to the sun; and that the king got up and rode to meet the sun at its rising, as far as from the eastern gate of the Temple to the suburbs of Jerusalem (Calmet).

And this may account for the romantic stories of his glory, and suggest the motive for ascribing the erection of this golden temple to him. T he internal measures of the Temple are just double those of the Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies being 20 cubits, or 360 inches square, with a perimeter of 1,440 inches, while the Holy Place is 720 by 360 inches, having a perimeter of 2,160 , the number o f miles in the moon's diameter; its width being 20 cubits, it just contains the sun’s orbit, taking the sun’s distance at 10 ; and its diagonal is 63 1 / 3 cubits, which is nearly the circumference of the sun’s orbit ( 20 x 3 1 / 7 = 62 6 / 7 ). The rhombus, which contains the Holy of Holies and Holy Place, has a perimeter of 217.80 cubits, or the diameter of the sun’s orbit. The measures of the porch are. 180 × 360 inches, which gives a perimeter of 1,080 , the number of miles in the moon’s radius. The in - terna l length of the Temple, from east to west, in - cluding the porch, is 76 cubits, or 1,368 inches, and 144 × 9 1 / 2 = 1,368 , and a vesica 1,368 broad is 2,368 long. The perimeter of the Temple ex - ternally is 471 feet, or the diameter of a circle having a ci rcumference of 1,480 (Christos); and its length externally, from east to west, is 98 cubits, which is about the radius of Saturn’s orbit, if the sun's distance be taken at 10 . The width of two intersecting circles forming a vesica 98 broad is 294 , th e number of the name ecclesia, the Church. The width of the front is 59 cubits, or 88 feet, or 1,062 inches, and 88 is the amount of the sun’s declination in the ecliptic measured by its own diameter. The length, from the outside of the eastern wall to the outside of the western wall of the Holy of Holies, is 88 cubits. The ex -"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 176 ternal width of the cell is 576 inches, the width, including the side chambers, being 756 inches, the height of the cross, whose extreme length is 1,080 . The three divisions of the Temple were called DBIR, 216 , HKL, 55 , or HIKL, 65 , and AVLM, 637 . The name of the Holy of Holies, DBIR, has the value of the diameter of the sun’s orbit; the num - bers 55 and 65 , deduced from the names of the Holy Place, express the number of miles in the earth’s diameter divided by 12 twice, and the side of the Holy Oblation (the sum of the numbers from 1 to 64 = 2,080 ); whilst the name of the porch, AVLM, denotes the cross ( 637 1 / 2 × 2 = 1,275 ). The three numbers evidently symbolize the per - son s of the great cabalistic triad, the macrocosm being represented by the sun, the microcosm by the Holy Oblation, and the Bride by the elemental cross. 216 + 1 216 + 1 55 + 1 65 + 1 637 + 1 } 692 637 + 1 ——— ——— 908 + 3 = 911 918 + 3 = 921 A ccording to the first valuation, the sum of the three numbers, with the addition and subtraction of colel, is either 905 or 911 . The number 905 is the circumference of the two circles, producing a vesica having a perimeter of 603 1 / 2 , which is the side of another vesica 1,046 long, or the radius of the circle which contains the square 1,480 . The same vesica measures 249 3 / 1 3 by 144 , and 249.264 × 9.5 = 2,368 . Again, 55 + 637 = 692 , or one more than the length of the sun’s orbit; and 216 + 637 = 853 , the side of a vesica 1,480 long. Then 911 is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 227 1 / 2 , which gives the height of a"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 177 man 2,160 high ( 227 1 / 2 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,160 ). And 911 is the numerical equivalent of RAS H IT H , Beginning. In the second case, the sum of the numbers, with the addition of colel to each, is 921 , the numerical equivalent of the Greek word, KANWN (canon). The Temple is designed i n a peculiar form, being in fact in the shape of the ithyphallos, the appropriate symbol of the great triad, and 97 (the radius of the Holy Oblation, taking the sun's distance at 10 ), multiplied by 9 1 / 2 , produces 921 , the sum of the three names. It is not proposed to enter minutely into the measures of the last temple of the Jews, described by Josephus and the Rabbis. But the altar of that temple has been so fully commented upon by old writers, and its measures having been carefully recorded, it may be profitably examined here. The altar was situated in the court in front of the temple, its height was 10 cubits, and it was arranged in three stories. The foundation was 32 cubits square and 1 cubit high; it therefore contains 1,024 solid cubits ( 3 2 2 = 1,024 ) which is the radius of Saturn’s orbit. The next storey is 30 cubits square by 5 cubits high, and contains 4,500 solid cubits. The third storey is 28 cubits square by 4 cubits high, and contains 3,136 solid cubits. Now, 1,024 + 4,500 + 3,1 36 = 8,660 , and this number is the perimeter of a square whose sides are 2,165 ( 4 660 8 , = 2,165 ) , the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. This calculation bringing out the moon’s diameter, seems to account for the horns, which were fashioned upon its corners, and for which there is no satisfactory explanation extant. There is a further peculiarity about the founda - tion of this altar noticed by Oliver (“Landmarks;” vol. ii., p. 431 ). He says 5 and 7 are the nearest"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 178 roots of two sq uare numbers, one of which is double the other, or, in other words, 5 is very nearly the side of a square whose diagonal is seven. Therefore, if the area of the one square ( 5 × 5 = 25 ) be double the area of the other square ( 7 × 7 = 49 ), and if in bot h these squares we make all the stones we can double squares, we get all the stones but one in each square of the proportion of the Holy Place, that is, a double square; but the corner one being square, or of the proportion of the Holy of Holies, was ca lled the chief corner stone; and the one wanting to the 49 to make the double square was identified with the Logos or Messiah. The lesser square has twelve stones and the holy one, and symbolizes the Messiah and the twelve prophets or apostles; while th e greater one contains twenty - four stones corre - sponding to the twenty - four elders: “thereby making the future glory and perfection of the Mosaic or Christian dispensation analogous to the duplication of the square.” The holy corner stone is placed in the south - east angle (“Bab. Talmud”). Now the Rabbis, in their description of the altar, say, “the length of the foundation on every side of the square was 32 cubits . . . but in the south - east angle it wanted somewhat, to make the corner a perfect ang le” (Lightfoot, “Temple,” p. 195 ). And 32 cubits are equal to 48 feet. But if the foundation were 49 on every side, its area would be ( 2,368 + 33 =) 2,401 . Therefore this square must have a piece deducted from it to make it exactly 2,368 square. If this be the mystery referred to by Oliver, it is necessary to suppose that the altar was composed of 49 such cubes as he describes, each 7 feet square, then the area of the upper face of the odd stone being 33 and its thickness being 7 , its cubical co ntents would be 231 , and this odd piece is apparently to be"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 179 taken from the south - east angle. The reason for calling the rejected stone the chief corner stone may be due to the extraordinary number of cosmic measures found in the multiples of 231 . For i nstance, 231 × 2 = 462 , which is the height of a rood cross whose extreme length is 660 or 12 920 7 , . Then 231 × 3 = 693 , which is nearly the length of the sun's orbit ( 220 × 3 1 / 7 = 691 ). And 231 × 4 = 924 , which is the square root of the sun’s diameter in miles. Again, 231 × 5 = 1,155 , which is one more than the length of a vesica 666 broad. And 231 × 9 = 2,079 , which is nearly 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s circumference, divided by 12 . And a square whose sides are 230 1 / 5 has a diagonal of 325 1 / 2 ; therefor e the two limbs of a cross drawn within it measure 651 (= 325 1 / 2 × 2 ), and 651 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 2,046 , the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. A circle whose area is equal to that of a square whose sides are 231 has a diame ter of 260 and a circumference of 817 , and 817 is the length of a vesica 471 broad, and 471 is the diameter of a circle having a circum - ference of 1,480 . Thus it would appear that the stone which the builders rejected became the head stone of the corne r, because it contained the number 231 , the measures of the earth, the sun, and the universe. This number 231 seems to have been one of the great canonical numbers. In the cabalistic book “Yetsirah” we hear of 231 gates or combination of letters, whi ch, together with the 10 Sephiroth are called “the foundation of all things.” And 231 is the sum of the numbers from 1 to 21 ; and this may have occasioned the omission of the number 22 from the cards of the Tarot, their sum being 231 . The Greek word, Ôno ma , a name, has the numerical value of 231 , and the peri - meter of the lid of the pyramid coffer is 231 inches."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 180 It was said that the square whose area was 49 was double that which was 25 . Francis Potter, in his work on the number 666 , has pointed out th e importance attached to the number 25 in the Romish Church. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 25 is 325 , and 325 1 / 2 is the diagonal of a square whose sides are 2,305 . He gives a diagram of the altar of St. Peter, in St. Peter’s Church at Rome, which he says was a cube 25 feet on every side. The area of one of the sides of the altar would therefore be 25 2 = 625 , and its solid bulk would be 25 3 = 15,625 feet. According to Archimedes a circle which has a circumference of 15,625 (actually between 15,610 and 15,620 ) is 4,970 in diameter; now, if the number be increased to 15,635 , the square which incloses this circle has a perimeter of 4,975 × 4 = 19,902 , and 19,902 feet = 238,828 inches, or the number of miles in the moon’s dis - tance from the earth. Therefore, the altar of St. Peter has the same numerical significance as the altar described by the Rabbis. This cubical stone or altar is evi dently a symbol of the rock Petros. The number 5 , the square root of 25 , was further accentuated by the stamping of the 5 wounds of Christ in 5 places in every altar. Another mystical statement about Herod’s temple, which may be mentioned, is that of Jos ephus with respect to the stones used in its construction. He says, “Now the temple was built of stones that were white and strong, and each of their length was 25 cubits, their height was 8 , and their breadth about 12 ” (“Antiq.,” bk. xv., chap.xi.). And 25 × 8 × 11.84 = 2,368 , the nu - merical value of the name Jesus Christ. Again, 25 cubits = 37 1 / 2 feet, and 12 cubits = 18 feet, and 37 1 / 2 × 18 = 675 , therefore, the area of the top of these stones, if we add colel, was 676 , the square of 26 , the number of Tetragrammaton. Further,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"TOWER OF BABEL. 181 the area of the side of one of these stones is 18 × 12 = 216 feet, the diameter of the sun’s orbit. The temple described by Ezekiel is so much more magnificent in scale than that of Solomon, and so disproportionately large f or a city of the size of Jerusalem, that the commentators have been obliged to acknowledge it as a visionary structure. In fact, the precincts are stated to be so great that, when drawn upon the site, they nearly cover the whole area of the city. Each side of the temple is given at 500 cubits of 21 inches, that is, the cubit and handbreadth or palm, which is 1 / 6 of an ordinary cubit of a foot and a half. Now 500 of these great cubits are equal to 583 1 / 3 common cubits. The peribolus is given at 125 r eeds, or 750 great cubits, while the outer wall measures 500 reeds. The courts of Ezekiel’s temple, like the camp, are formed into a diagram illustrating the squaring of the circle (see p. 37 ). And the diagonal of a square whose side is 583 1 / 3 being 825 , the diameter of the circle whose area is equal to that of the temple is 660 ( 10 825 = 82.5 × 8 = 660 ) or 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s diameter in miles. Again, a vesica formed of two circles whose united width is 583 1 / 3 measures 194.4 broad, and therefore contains the circle of the Zodiac, the sun’s distance being taken at 10 . Moreover the peribolus bei ng 750 cubits square is enclosed by a rhombus inscribed within the orbit of Saturn. The outer square of 500 reeds may indicate the lunar year, for the diagonal of a square 354 is 500 1 / 2 . And two diagonals of a square, each measuring 501 , amount to 1,002 , or half the number 2,004 , the numerical equivalent of the Greek names of the elements."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 182 “Strange and uncouth,” says Samuel Lee, “is the fancy of Villalpanda stating the temple’s typical similitude in proportion to and with the body of our Blessed Lord upon the cross, with His arms stretched out and His legs conjoined together, in such a manner; as that His head should possess the sanctuary, and his breast the altar, His feet the eastern gate; in His hands the two gates on the north and south side o f the temple, so that as the passage or way to the altar and sanctuary lay open through those principal gates, in like manner should the path to the sanctuary be made plain and easy, through the wounds of His feet and hands. Whence it is, that the brazen sea, which was situ - ated on the south side of the temple, near the altar, should prefigure the water and blood issuing out of the right side of the Lord.” (“Solomon's Temple,” 1659 , p. 189 ). It has already been explained that a rood cross inscribed within the square contained by the cir - cumference of the earth divided by 12 has many analogies with the measures of the universe. A man crucified on such a cross would be enclosed by a circle equal to the sun’s orbit, and the extreme length of the cross is 6 66 . From the preceding analysis of the measures of the temple it appears that the fancy of Villalpanda is not so strange as Samuel Lee pretends, nor is it more strange than some of his own “fancies,” which any one may read in the work just quoted.

The beginning of the sixteenth century, when Cesariano was editing Vitruvius, was the beginning of that time of severance. It marks the decadence of the old ideas, preserved and continued under various conditions from an origin reaching back thousands of years, and inaugurates the birth of the new and necessarily crude doctrines, which have, ever since, been gradually replacing the ac - cumulated store of achievement which the art of countless generations of men had brought to a marvellous perfection. Amongst other changes, and coincident with the decay of so much else, we notice at this time the gradual disappearance of the old order of practical Freemasons, and a corresponding decline in all the architectural arts. The change of religious opinions affecting the whole basis of theology, necessarily extended to the design of the churches, entrusted during the Middle Ages to the Freemas ons who had worked according to the ancient rules received in continuity from their predecessors, who had worshipped the older gods of earlier systems, whose rites still survived and accorded with the primitive Christianity of the mediaeval Church. It wa s when this old conception of religion began to be superseded at the Reformation, that the need or desire for a body of architects instructed in theological mysteries no longer acknowledged, ceased to exist, and the secret methods of all pre - vious temple b uilders left in the hands of the Freemasons fell into disuse and were gradually forgotten."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 185 Out of the records of the modern lodges, and other collateral sources, it is possible to derive a clue to the mysterious rules which constituted the canonical method of building churches, according to ecclesiastical use and practice.

All these canonical forms appear to depend upon one fundamental mystery, which we shall now only attempt to explain in its architectural aspect. It is stated by J. S. Hawkins (“Origin of Gothic Architecture,” p. 183 ) that during the ere ction of the dome of Sienna, in 1321 , the five gentlemen appointed to inspect the building objected to the continuance of the work, “because if completed as it had been begun it would not have that measure in length, breadth, and height, which the rules of a church require. And they further added that the old structure, to which as it seems the new ad - joined, was so justly proportioned, and its members so well agreed with each other in breadth, length, and height, that if in any one part an addition were made to it under the pretence of reducing it to the right measure of a church, the whole would be destroyed.” (Quoted from a document dated 1321 , published by Della Valle, “Lettere Senese,” vol. ii., p. 60 ). One of the most direct evidences of th e old mystical rule of building is found in Cesariano’s edition of Vitruvius, published at Como, in 1521 . In this valuable and remarkable book there are a plan and sections of Milan Cathedral, drawn with the geometrical forms, which are said to have de - termined the proportions of the building. It would appear that this so - called German method of fixing the measures of a cathedral does partly reveal"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 186 the canonical methods of the masons, and that it, also applies to the classical temples described by Vi truvius, otherwise it would scarcely find a place as an illustration in this work. Nor would an architect of the Renascence, who built by the rules of Vitruvius, and who must have been instructed in the German manner of design, make the mis - take of cl aiming a common basis for classical and mediaeval architecture, if such an agreement had not existed. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy, the book of Vitruvius was held in the highest esteem, and societies were even insti - tuted for it s study and interpretation (Addington Symonds). This appreciation must have been due to some cause unknown to modern critics, for this work is no longer read, and does not form, as it used to do, the one text book on the art of building, revered as much by an architect as the canonical Scriptures are by a priest. And it is not surprising to find that modern architects, who do not know that the treatise of Vitruvius is a mystical book, and do not understand the rules which he teaches, have considered t he introduction of the plan of Milan Cathedral as an irrelevant digression on the part of Cesariano; whereas, it is really a most important illustration of the principles of archi - tecture common to all ancient peoples. It would be unreasonable to expect that we should have in this scheme, applied to the cathedral at Milan, a complete exposition of all the mysteries of the archi - tectural canon, but we have as much as Cesariano dared to reveal, and enough to establish the funda - mental principle of the old geometrical system of design. By the scheme before us, the geometrical figure, forming the basis of the plan of Milan cathedral, is the rhombus or vesica. It is here invisibly introduced into the plan as the mystical comple -"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 187 FIG . 15 . — SECTION OF MILAN CAT HEDRAL , FROM THE CUT IN CESARIANO ’ S EDITION OF “ VITRUVIUS ,” FOLIO XV , VERSO ."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 188 ment of the cross, which is openly and avowedly exhibited in the form of the church. Speaking of the secret rites at Eleusis, Hippo - lytus tells us that the mystery of the Greeks was called “Eleusin” and “Anactorion.” “Eleusin, because we who are spiritual come flowing down from A dam above; for the word ‘Eleusesthi’ is of the same import with the words ‘to come.’ But ‘Anactorion’ is of the same import with the ex - pression ‘To ascend upwards’ ” (Ref. v. 3 ). This also was the mystery of the Christian church, and every cathedral s ymbolized by its plan those two mysterious factors of existence. By the cross they symbolized “Eleusin,” and “Anactorion” by the rhombus. Anactorion was a word commonly used by the Greeks for a temple. It means the royal house or the king’s house, and it has the numerical value of 672 , which is 1 more than the value of the Hebrew word Thora, 671 , the Bride. 1 She was mystically laid as the foundation or pavement of every church, prepared to received from above Her Spouse or Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus. T his is the mystery which the cross and the rhombus united together signified during the Middle Ages, and in all previous times. They are the emblems of the double soul of the universe, personified by Eros and Psyche, Osiris and Isis, Dionysus and Perse - phone, and countless other names. Having indicated the symbolical meaning of the rhombus, it will be seen, when the measures are examined, that this figure drawn upon Cesariano’s plan is made to contain the cosmic measures 1 The name HIKL, 65 , applied to Solomon’s Temple, is equivalent by Gematria to Adonai, whose name also produces 671 . Therefore the two names Anactorion and HIKL afford another example of the numerical agreement of the Greek and Hebrew languages."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 189 FIG . 16. — PLAN OF MILAN CATHED RAL , FROM CHSARIANO ’ S EDITION OF “ VITRUVIUS ,” FOLIO XIIII"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 190 found in the Holy Oblation, the city of Ezekiel, and the New Jerusalem, and that it determines the proportions and dimensions of the church, in conformity with these mystical patterns. The in - side measure of the transepts, and the centre of the apse, are fixed by the rhombus, mark ed on the plan by the letters EFGH. This rhombus is 128 cubits wide, and has a perimeter of 512 (= 128 × 4 ). Now 512 is the side of a square having a perimeter of 2,048 , the diameter of Saturn's orbit; and 512 cubits are equal to 768 feet, a number whi ch is 1 less than the length of the transverse beam of a cross 1,656 high, or the number of miles from the equator to the tropics, measured on the earth’s circumference, and the full measure of this cross is 2,366 2 / 3 . Then the greater rhombus, ABCD, mar king the extreme width and length of the building, is 144 × 249 3 / 5 cubits, and has a perimeter of 576 (Pneuma, 576 ). If the cubits be reduced to feet, the numbers become 216 by 373 , and the number 373 is the numerical value of the name Logos. Then 216 is the diameter of the sun’s orbit. The width of the cathe dral is 144 cubits, and 144 × 9 1 / 2 = 1,368 , thus giving the height of a man standing in the vesica produced by two intersec - ting circles, whose united width is 2,368 . Again, the internal length of the building from east to west is given by Cesariano a s being 250 cubits, and 249 1 / 4 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 ; therefore, the length and the width of the building are decided according to the length of what Sir John Maundeville calls the “Cross of our Lord,” and the cross of 'Ihsoàs CristÒj . The height of the build ing, up to the middle of the figure standing upon the pinnacle of the tower, is 155.79 cubits, and this number multiplied by 9 1 / 2 = 1,480 , so that the three prin - cipal dimensions of this great Italian cathedral"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 191 are derived from the measures of three hu man bodies, 1,368 , 1,480 , and 2,368 cubits high re - spectively. The nave or ship of the church is 144 cubits, or 216 feet long, and is an appropriate measure for the ark of the sun. Then the length, from the centre of the apse to the western wall, is 235 cubits, the side of the New Jerusalem. There is the following allusion to the system of geometric proportions in the “Hypnerotomachia,” Aldus, 1499 , verso of sig. c: “At length being come to this ancient porch, a worke worthie the looking upon marvellousl y composed by exquisite rules, and by art nobly beautified, with divers and sundry sorts of cuttings, which did inflame a desire in me to understand and find out the lineaments and practise of the architect.

For take away order and rule , and what thing can any man make, either beautifull to the eye, or of commendable proportio n and durable?” (English translation, fol. 18 .) The meaning of the passage is certainly obscure, but the explanation may be suggested thus: The “tetragon figure ABCD” is a square, whose sides are 16 , and the “rhombus” of half that width measures 16 × 8 . The two combined produce a rectangle 24 × 16 , having an area of 384 . Now a vesica 384.225 broad is 666 long, and 384 is the radius of the sun's orbit measured by the tone. The two “diagons” or diagonals, drawn within the square ABCD, form a saltire, t he symbol of the microcosm, and their length is nearly 22 2 / 3 , there - fore by the rule of Vitruvius the corresponding square of the macrocosm would have an area of 512 ( 16 2 = 256 × 2 = 512 ). And since a square whose sides are 512 has a perimeter of 2,048 , the diameter of Saturn’s orbit, the whole figure sets forth the measures of the seven planetary orbits and sphere of the Zodiac, containing the body of Christos in the square 1,480 , first by the square and rhombus, the symbols of man and woman, and se condly by the duplication of the square. The four equal “quadrats” made by the cross lines have each an area of 64 , and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 64 is 2,080 . It will be noticed that the proportion of the rhombus given here is that of a doubl e square, and not 26 : 15 as indicated by Cesariano on the plan of Milan cathedral.

The word O• ι k oj (house), used commonly for the house of man, was also applied to the house of God. It has a numerical value of 370 , which, multiplied by 4 , produces 1,480 , the side of the square contained within the sphere of the Zodiac or the outermost sphere of the universe, inclosed by the Holy Oblation. The name `Ieron , again, means properly the Holy Thing or the Holy Place. Its numerical value is 235 , which is the length of the side of the New Jerusalem, inclosing the inner orbits of the planets. The word N aos is spelt in two ways, Newj , 1,055 , Naoj , 321 . This, like the Latin and English words Navis and Nave, is the ship of the temple ( Naoj = Nauj ). It was that part of the structure which contained the mystical Argo or Ark, having a meaning analogous to th e cross. The number 1,055 is the length of a vesica 609 broad, and 194 × 3 1 / 7 = 609 . By transposition the number 321 becomes 312 , which is 1 more than the internal width of an ark containing the sun’s course measured by the tone. Naos has the same n u - merical value as KalÒj , Beautiful, and 321 is the mean between 320.37 and 322.76 , the diameters of the circles which produce the two vesicas 671 and 676 in circumference. Sekos ( ShkÒj ), the name applied to the cell of a temple, has the value of 498 , a nd 499 is the measure of a cross whose limbs are 249 1 / 4 ( 249 1 / 4 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 ). TÕ p©n , the world, is numerically equal to 501 – 2 = 499 . The name Temenos was given to the precincts of a temple, and it has the value of 670 , the numerical equivalent of Ð kosmoj , the universe."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 195 Further, tÕ tšmenoj yields 1,040 , the ra dius of the sphere of the Zodiac. Before Christian times a Greek altar was called BwmÒj , which yields the number 1,112 , which is the circumference of a circle having a diameter of 354 , the number of days in the lunar year. As may be seen from ancient vase s, the altars of the Greeks were made with horns at their corners, that they might resemble the horned moon. And by Gema - tria Bomos is equivalent to Zodiakos, 1,112 . In the midst of every Christian church around the Omphalos or cross at its centre was the Choros, or choir, set apart for the singers. The name Choros had long been familiar in classical Greece, as applied to certain players who acted a peculiar and important part in the old tragedies. But originally the Choros was a dance by which th e earliest worshippers invoked the deity, moving with measured steps around the altar. Theseus is said to have first taught this mystic dance at Athens. And the name Choros yields 1,040 , the radius of the zodiacal circle contained within the Holy Oblat ion. Therefore when the Greek youths and virgins danced round the primitive altar or sacred fire, they sought to reproduce the chorus of the twelve stars, which mark the intervals of the sun’s course in his yearly revolution. This simple ritual was the prototype foreshadowing all the elaborate ceremonies in the costly temples of after times, and admirably illustrates the first impulse towards the imitation of the measured harmony of the heavenly bodies, whose circular motions were counterfeited by the ch oral dance. And the choir (Choros) of the Christian church, “who mystically represent the Cherubim” (Liturgy of St. Chrysos - tom), sang also in imitation of the celestial music. It has been shown that the Apostles are equiva - lent to the signs of the Zod iac; and Samuel Lee"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 196 says that the Church was “signified by the moon and the twelve stars of the Apostles” (“Sol. Temp.,” p. 181 ); and Peter was called by St. Chrysostom “the leader of the Apostolic choir\" ( Ð korufa‹oj toà coroà ). The name given to the C hurch by the early Christians was the ordinary Greek word for an assembly. Numerically the word Ecclesia has the value of 294 , and by Gematria it is equivalent to ¹ 'Akad»meia , which was adopted by Plato as the name of his school, for a vesica formed by two intersecting circles whose united width is 294 is 98 wide; and 98 is the value of the word M¾n , a month, which by Gematria is equivalent to `Elšnh , the name of the heroine of the “Iliad,” and the Empress of Rome, who is said to have found the true c ross at Jerusalem. The moon, or month, was often mentioned by early writers as a symbol of the Church, and St. Helena may be recognized as a personification of it. The vesica was one of the or - dinary symbols of the Church, mystically honoured as the spo use of Christ. And St. Helena’s discovery of the cross, the complement of the vesica, is a metaphorical way of expressing the nuptial union of the Christos and Ecclesia. If the number 294 be united to 1,480 (Christos) we get 1,774 . Now two interlacing t riangles whose sides are 1,774 are exactly contained within the orbit of Saturn. This figure, commonly called Solomon’s seal, has always been revered by Christians as the symbol of the Trinity — the Father or first person of the Triad being, presumably, implied by the circle of Saturn. And if 1,090 , the numerical value of Chronos, be added, the three numbers amount to 2,867 , or 1 less than the sum of the numbers obtained from the names of the ten steps of the Cabala: "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 197 C HRONOS . . 1,090 C HRISTOS . . 1,480 E CCLESIA . . 294 } 1774 —— – 2,864 + 3 = 2,867. Then, 294 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 924 , the square root of the sun’s diameter in miles. And 294 3 / 5 × 10 = 2,946 , the diagonal of the Holy Oblation. These measures seem to have been in the mind of St. Cyril when he says that the Church “is called Catholic be - cause it is throughout the world from one end of the earth to the other; and because it teaches universally and completely one and all the doc - trines which ought to come to men's knowledge concerning things both visible and invisible, heavenly and earthly” (“Cat. Lect.,” xviii., p. 250 ). At any rate, such a description could hardly apply to the paltry assembly of Christians who in his day met mostly in h oles and corners as advocates of a new and despised mythos. The basilicas of the Romans were frequently converted into churches by the early Christians. The name was retained, and was often used to designate a church. Basilikº is numerically equal to 281 , which is the amount of the diameter of the moon’s orbit, or the sublunary world, divided by 12 thrice, 12 576 485 , = 12 464 40 , = 12 372 3 , = 281 . Afterwards the name cathedral was generally applied to the great churches of the west. This word is derived from Kaqšdra , 140 , a chair or seat; and ¹ Kaqšdra , that is, the chair, or God’s seat, has the numerical value of 148 , and 148 is a common measure of the three numbers, 888 , 1,480 , and 2,368 . The word ›dra , 110 , or ›drh , 117 , was also applied to an altar or temple. And the number"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 198 110 is the measure of the sun’s distance, and 116 and a fraction is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 360 . The Christians called their altar T HUSIASTERION , 1,358 , whi ch is the circumference of a circle 432 in diameter. Now every altar was inscribed with five crosses, or quincunx, of five points, and if we multiply 432 by 5 we get 2,160 , the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. And the altar was connected with t he moon both by the Greeks and Hebrews. Again, 432 is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 137 2 / 3 , which is nearly the side of a square contained within the Holy Obla - tion, if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 . That is to say, 137 is equiva lent to 1,480 . The number 432 is also the width of the two intersecting circles which produce the vesica 144 by 249 1 / 4 . Lastly, 432 is the side of a square having a diagonal of 611 , the perimeter of a square inscribed within the sun’s orbit.

There is another reason why the Bema or sanctuary, which symbolized Heaven or the Empyreum, may have been so called.

The classical Greeks called the stone from which the Athenians spoke in the Pnyx, the Bema. Choros has the value of 1,040 , or 1 and a fraction less th an the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac, while 228 (Narthex) multiplied by 9 1 / 2 produces 2,156 , the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. With the addition of colel 1,040 and 228 amount to 1,270 , or 1 less than the numerical value of Stauros, a cros s. The Narthex, or hollow reed by which Prometheus brought down the mystic fire to earth, is peculiarly appropriate to the ideas connected with the third division of a temple or church. The belief that some mysterious purpose exists in the design of the Egyptian pyramids, although unsupported by the direct testimony of those ancient authors who have alluded to them, may reasonably be held upon various grounds. All we learn from Herodotus is an inaccurate measure - ment, and the statement that the great pyramid was the tomb of Cheops, erected by him during his lifetime out of despotic vanity, and a desire to perpetuate his memory, if possible, for ever. It has been thought also, that the great pyramid was built as the royal treasury. But assuming that"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 200 both these objects, as they might have been, were the ostensible motives for its erection, this stu - pendous fabric may have included less apparent purposes, and given the opportunity to its archi - tects of applying to it whatever ideas prevailed at tha t time, as to the functions of architecture. That most skilful artificers were employed in its construction is sufficiently attested by the admirable finish and perfection of the masonry. And the marvellous accuracy in fitting and joining the stones fa vours the idea, that such careful niceties of workmanship must have been applied for some definite reason, which is certainly not that of pro - ducing an ornamental effect. Then the peculiarity of the internal arrangements point to the existence of some principle of design, which shows that the builders were governed by some other ideas than those of utility and permanence alone. If their only object had been to erect a vast heap of well hewn stones to enclose the body and treasures of Cheops, without ar t or design, the chambers and arrangements of the building would give some evidence of such artlessness in their contrivance. Instead of which, it is well known that the chambers and galleries of the pyramid have been devised upon a system which cannot be accounted for by any simple or obvious reasons. For the intentions of the builders, whatever they may have been, have led them far beyond the ordinary necessities of mere use. No architect, again, whose object was to pro - duce a beautiful building, w ould choose a pyramid as a means of accomplishing his end; therefore beauty cannot be regarded as the motive of his choice. But the pyramidal form must have been advisedly chosen: so, to discover his motive, we must inquire what purpose could be fulfille d archi - tecturally by an unadorned pyramid. The most"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 201 natural answer seems to be, that apart from its structural fitness, it was selected simply as a geo - metrical figure. And the existence of the pyra - mids, the oldest monuments in the world, seems to be a striking confirmation of the statements of the earliest writers, that architecture originally de - pended upon geometry, and we see in Egypt the first application of that science to building, un - accompanied by the ornaments which were after - wards brought into use. In the hands of geo - metrical architects the pyramid by its bulk, surface, lines, and angles, would afford the means of record - ing measures and numbers. For practical purposes, also, the pyramid is a most suitable form for a permanent fabric. For it stands on a solid base, and its sloping sides, rising to a point, prevent water from lodging upon its surface and causing decay. It is much better fitted for such a purpose than a cube, which has a flat top; moreover, while the latter figure ha s the greater number of sides, lines, and angles, the pyramid has more points of measurement. We shall, therefore, conclude that it was the object of the builders, by this simple geometrical figure to set up an enduring monument, exempli - fying by its measu res and numbers those canonical laws of Egypt, alluded to by Plato, which, it is supposed, were the pattern and source of all our later philosophical and theological systems. It accordingly follows that this remarkable structure is an exact embodiment of the universe, geo - metrically reduced to a pyramidal form, and ex - hibiting the true aspect of the cosmic system as it appeared and was known to the Egyptians at the time of its foundation. This view is borne out by the opinion of John Greaves, the old O xford astronomer, from whose work on “English Weights and Measures” we quote the following: “Accord -"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 202 ing to Arabic traditions, one of the pyramids is the sepulchre of Seth . . . and it seems probable that the pyramids are the pillars of Seth. And these p illars of Seth, according to Josephus, were in the very same place where Manetho placed the pillars of Thoth, called Seiread.” The words of Josephus respecting these pillars are: “They (the children of Seth) were the inventors of that peculiar sort of w isdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies and their order. And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, upon Adam’s prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the force of fire, and at anothe r time by the violence and quantity of waters, they made two pillars, the one of brick the other of stone; they inscribed their dis - coveries upon them both, that, in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might r emain, and exhibit those discoveries to mankind; and also inform them that there was another pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains in the land of Siriad to this day.” Statements of this kind being generally mis - understood at the present time, the subjoined passage taken from another part of the work of Greaves, quoted above, may help to explain the meaning of the tradition. “In the first ages of the world, an obscure way of expressing things was practised by the wise and learned, to whom i t seemed good not to expose everything they knew to the eyes of the vulgar, who would not relish such matters that were too sublime for their other - wise disposed thoughts.” The latter part of this sentence is an admirable piece of philosophic cant, but as Greaves himself adopted the ancient practice indicated here, it is necessary to receive his state - ments in a proper spirit. Accordingly, when he quotes with approval the Arabic tradition, he does"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 203 so, knowing that it does not express the literal truth . He merely repeats it that he may convey the hint that the pyramids were set up for astro - nomical reasons. Their builders, he says, hoped “by this means to preserve, as long as the world endures, those sciences which their long experience had found ou t for the good of mankind.” And again, he adds, “what is in these pyramids yet undiscovered I know not; but this, I believe, that what learning is here to be found was also written upon tables, or in books, whose title was ‘Inscrip - tions on the Pillars o f Seth.’ ” The place where the Pillars of Seth are said to have stood, is called Siriad, which may be taken to mean the place of Anubis, who marked the sol - stitial or midsummer sun, and it is therefore the region of the abode of the sun. The name S...riad , or Se‹read , has the value of 325 , and by Gematria it is equivalent to œnoj , a year. And if 325 be taken as the perimeter of a triangle or pyramid, its sides are 108 1 / 3 or the sun’s distance measured by its own diameter. And 325 1 / 2 × 2 = 651 , which is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2,046 , the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. From these numbers it would appear that the astronomical Pillars of Seth were located in a very appropriate place. And the name of their founder SHQ ( 217 , the diameter of the sun’s orbit) adds further con - firmation to the name of the locality. It will also appear that Siriad is a name equally appropriate to the site of the Great Pyramid, and, strange to say, John Greaves seems to have consider ed it so. In Arbuthnot's “Tables,” published in 1727 , the following quotation from Bishop Cumberland appears on p. 68 : “The sides of the base of the Great Pyramid are delivered, on p. 68 of Mr. Greaves’ ‘Pyramidographia,’ to be 693 English feet. For red uction these must be divide by"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 204 1.824 , which is his length of the Cairo cubit in our foot measure — the quote is 379.934 which is so very little short of 380 Cairo cubits, that I think it is reasonable to believe that the old architects designed just this even number of Egyptian cubits.” To this Arbuthnot objects, saying that “the strength of the Bishop's argument depends chiefly upon 380 being a remarkable number, such as an architect would choose for the dimension of the principal part of his fabric .” The curious fact about this statement is, that both the Bishop and Arbuthnot should consider 380 a “remarkable number.” It is needless to say that such a pro - position is quite unintelligible to a modern architect, to whom one number is no more remarkable than another. Now Greaves, by bringing out 38 o cubits from 693 feet, manages to state two measures of the sun’s orbit very nearly. For the cir - cumference of a circle diameter 220 is 691 , and the sun’s distance, measured by the Tone, or interval betwee n the earth and the moon, is 383 . It has been shown that, according to the system of Cesariano applied to Milan Cathedral the rhombus formed the basis upon which the plan of that church was constructed. And assuming that Cesariano's method was the tradi tional secret of all ancient builders, it has now to be tried whether any trace of it exists in the design of the Great Pyramid. Externally the pyramid has but five main external measurements. The length of the side of its square base is 755 2 / 3 English feet and the diagonal of the base is 1,069 3 / 5 feet. Its vertical height is 481 1 / 3 feet. The slope of its sides are 611 4 / 5 feet and the measure along the angles is 733 9 / 1 0 feet.

Having found that each side of the base of the Great Pyramid measures 755 2 / 3 feet, there will be nothing ridiculous in considering what ideas the Greeks, who wrote the Gospel, connected with the word Petros, 755 , a stone. If the text of the Gospel were liter - ally translated, the name Peter would be rendered “the Stone,” for it almost invariab ly appears as Ð Pštroj , 825 . According to the traditions, St. Peter is said to have been the younger brother of St. Andrew, the oldest of the Apostles. He was born three years before the Virgin, and seventeen years FI G . 18 — THE CUBICAL STONE before the Incarnation of Christ. He was the first Pope of Rome, and held the See for twenty - five years.

And it is not impossible that the number 755 , preserved in the name Petros, may have been the measure of the canonical stone of the old Egyptian priests, handed down by a continuous tradition, and received by the Christians. It was apparently t his measure, with all it expressed and concealed, that the old builders sought to give an everlasting permanence in the Great Pyramid. Assuming that the Egyptians built their pyra - mid as a symbol of the universe, it may be sup - posed that they chose the n umber 755 as the side of the square base for the following reasons. For it is possible to deduce from this square, chiefly by means of the rhombus, an approximate representa - tion of the whole planetary system. No scheme, depending upon a simple geometr ical process, can quite accurately measure the universe, because it does not happen to have been constructed upon any such simple principle, therefore the number 755 is more or less a compromise. It must also be assumed that figures corresponding to th e temple of Ezekiel and the city of the New Jeru - salem, were known to, if not invented by, the pyramid - builders. To arrive at the numbers intended to be re - corded by the architect of any building, it is neces - sary to know the standard by which it has be en set out. What standard was used in the pyramid is unknown. There is, however, we believe, reason for assuming that the standard measure now in use in Great Britain is similar to that which was here employed by the Egyptians. Now, taking the English foot to be equal to a diameter of the sun, it will be found that the rhombus which contains the square base of the pyramid ( 755 2 / 3 feet) is 2,065 long, and the num - ber 2,065 is the mean between 2,083 , the side of the Holy Oblation, and 2,047 , the diame ter of"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 207 Saturn’s orbit. Therefore the extremities of the rhombus reach to the middle point, between the sphere of Saturn and the sphere of the Zodiac. This is simply a practical illustration of the same geometrical problem which is illustrated by the per ibolus of Ezekiel's temple. The number 755 , found in the name Petros, may give the clue to the next step. At any rate, a cubical stone, or hexagon, which measures 755 2 / 3 feet diagonally from point to point, drawn within FIG . 19. — THE GREAT PYRAMID EN CLOSED BY A RHOMBUS INSCRIBED WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THE ZODIA C the pyramid, gives by its width the side of a rhombus which nearly incloses a square of the same dimensions as the city of Ezekiel — each of its sides being 416 diameters of the sun; and, again, the length of another rhombus, which roughly incloses a square similar to the New Jerusalem, whose sides are 236 diameters of the sun. And a third rhombus, drawn within this last, is 217 on its sides, or the diamete r of the sun’s orbit, and also the numerical value of the name Seth, as it appears in the Septuagint, or Christian version of the Old Testament. Thus"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 208 the whole scheme leads us to the sun’s orbit, as its centre, and there is no impropriety, according to the ancient manner of speech, in the Arabians calling the innermost rhombus the tomb of Seth, 217 . A vesica, inclosed within the square 755 , con - tains a Solomon's seal which holds the New Jeru - salem within the bases of its two triangles, and these two triangles form a rhombus whose sides are 272 , the numerical value of the name Harmonia (wife of Cadmos); and the circle which incloses the seal is 1,480 in circumference. If this circle be inclosed in a square its sides are 471 , and its diagonal is 666 , and that square is inclosed by a decagon whose perimeter is 2,151 . The number 272 appears to be called harmony, because a vesica 272 wide is 471 long, or the diameter of a circle 1,480 in circumference, and 272 is also the diameter of a circle which is 853 in circumference, and 853 is the width of a vesica 1,480 long. That is to say, by a circle and a vesica, it brings out the number 1,480 . The length of a vesica whose breadth ( 755.76 ) is equal to the side of the great pyramid, is 1,310 , or 1 less than the numerical value of Tetragrammaton. A rood - cross 756 high can be almost inclosed within the square base of the pyramid; it would, in fact, be four inches too long. Now the extreme measure of this cross is 1,080 , the number of miles in the moon's rad ius; and the numerical equi - valent of tÒ Pneàma “Agion , the Holy Ghost; and it will crucify the lesser man of Vitruvius in a square whose perimeter is 993 (= 248 1 / 4 × 4 ), the numerical value of the name Aphrodite; and the circle in - closing his body is 1,1 03 in circumference, or 1 more than the height of a cross which will crucify a man in a square whose perimeter is 2,048 , the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The name Hiram, the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 209 architect of Solomon's Temple, is translated by the Seventy Ceir£m , 756 . The diag onals of the base measure 1,069 3 / 5 , and a rhombus of this length has a perimeter of 2,468 (= 617.07 × 4 ), or 2 less than the value of Macroprosopos, Microprosopos, and Basileia, the names of the great cabalistic triad. Moreover, if the two diagonals be bent into two intersecting circles, in the Platonic manner, their united width is 510 3 / 4 or very nea rly one - quarter of the mean distance of Saturn's orbit; and the perimeter of the rhombus thus produced is 681 , or the length of the sun’s orbit, and 680 is the numerical equivalent of UƒÒj , the Son, or second person of the Christian Trinity. The sockets cut in the rock to receive the foundation stones at the four corners of the base are 760 5 / 1 2 feet apart. Therefore, if the lesser man of Vitruvius be drawn upon the plan, so that his feet and hands touch their four sockets, his body will measure diagona lly ( 1,075 1 / 2 × 2 =) 2,151 feet, and 2,151 is the number of years in the great month. The cross required to crucify this figure is 2,314 high, and it is a strange coincidence that a Solo - mon’s seal measuring 2,314 from point to point is composed of two triangles whose sides are 2,002 1 / 2 , or 1 1 / 2 less than 2,004 , the number out of which Plato formed his logos and the equivalent of the names of the four elements in Greek. The Hebrew names of the upper triad, or Long - face of the Cabala, yield 760 . The s ides of the core - masonry are 750 feet long at the base. Accordingly this square is contained in a rhombus inscribed within the orbit of Saturn. The vertical height of the pyramid is 481 1 / 3 feet, and this is the width of a vesica 834.288 long.

Again, a circle whose diameter is equal to the vertical height of the pyramid is double the leng th of the base, namely, 1,512 feet. Therefore if the twofold body of the logos, the male having been separated from the female, were bent into such a circle, the man above and the woman below, each semicircular figure would measure 755 2 / 3 . It is certain that the hemispheres were personified in Egypt by celestial beings who may in some way be connected with this circle. At any rate the logos of the Christians was symbolized by the con - joined letters C‹ , 610 , and `Rî , 900 ; and 611 + 901 = 1,512 , the ci rcumference of the said circle. The measure of a cross whose limbs are 481 1 / 3 long is ( 481 1 / 3 × 2 =) 962 2 / 3 , the numerical equival - ent of the word Tšcnh , Art. And 481 is the cir - cumference of a circle whose diameter is 153 , the side of the square contained within the sun’s orbit, having a perimeter of 612 , or 1 less than the number of precepts in the Hebrew law. The sloping sides of the pyramid measure 611 4 / 5 . And 611 is nearly the circumference of the sphere of the Zodiac contained within the Holy Oblation, if the sun's distance be taken at 10 . The name Zeus has value of 612 , and 611 is equiv alent to T H VRH, Thora, the Bride, or Law. The length from the base to the apex, measured on the four angles, is 733 9 / 1 0 feet. If shown upon the plan the lines of these angles would indicate the diagonals of the square in the form of a cross.

Accordingly the site of the pyramid may have been chosen at Memphis be - cause they found on constructing the analemma at tha t latitude (to a scale of one inch to a mile), that a square 2,368 inches set up in the centre of the earth, perpendicular to the horizon, is just con - tained within the tropics. And when a plan and section of the pyramids are drawn upon the circle 660 feet, or 7,920 inches in diameter, the distance of the south pole below the horizon marks the height of the passage to the Queen’s chamber, while the axis of the earth passes through the apex of the great stones over the King’s chamber. The length o f the equinoctial shadow, from the gnomon, 330 feet high or 3,960 inches, appears to be 192 feet, the shadow at the winter solstice about 454 , and that at the summer solstice 33 . The Pyramid itself, regarded as a gnomon, casts no shadow on the ground either at the summer solstice or the equinoxes, but at midwinter the shadow measures about 660 feet from the centre. The measurements in this paragraph are only taken from a rough geometrical diagram and are not calculated. The pavement surrounding the pyramid seems to have measured about 840 feet square, but its full extent does not appear to be ascertainable. The number 840 is numerically equivalent to Microcosmos. The fact that the cosmic numbers, which may be deduced from the dimensions of the pyr amid coffer, measured by the British inch, agree with those of the system which has been applied to the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 212 exterior of the building, is a decided evidence in favour of the belief, that the standard used by the Egyptians in setting out the pyramid, is simila r to that now in use in Great Britain. This coincidence, coupled with the fact that the British quarter measure is almost exactly a quarter of the contents of the pyramid chest, 1 may be thought sufficient to warrant an examination of the chest upon the h ypothesis, that the two standards are practically identical. There is no positive evidence that anyone was ever buried in this sarcophagus, but it is described as being exactly like the ordinary stone coffins of the time at which the pyramid is supposed to have been erected. It may have been the tomb of a hypothetical king, whose body was supposed to measure the parts of the world; that is to say, the practical embodiment of a structure like that de - scribed by Moses in the form of Noah’s ark. And, if w e knew all the secrets concealed in the mys - terious arrangements of the pyramid, it might be found that the tomb of the king, earthly or heavenly, played its part in the order of a symbolical scheme, reduced possibly to some pictorial figure or mystic para ble capable of being enacted with canonical ceremonies and initiatory rites. Whatever its use may have been, the following measurements may be found worthy of consideration. The foot having been taken as the unit of measurement in the main building, the inch be - comes the unit for the chest.

Moreover, a circle 2,151 in circumference is in - closed by a hexagon whose perimeter is 2,368 . A rhombus describe d round the square is 244.944 , or say 245 long, and 245 is the numerical equival - ent of ADM QDMVN, the supernal Adam or micro - cosm of the cabala. Further, this rhombus is surrounded by a circle having a circumference of 769.824 , which is the length of th e transverse beam of a rood cross 1,658.076 high, and 2,368.68 in its total extent. The number of miles in the radius of the moon’s orbit divided by 12 twice is 1,658 . The distance between the tropics measured by the sun's diameter is 89.48 , if the o rbit of the sun be taken at 220 diameters, and the inclination of the ecliptic at 24 degrees. The number 89 is the square root of the earth's diameter in miles ( 89 × 89 = 7,921 ). The external width of the coffer is 38.5 , or nearly the square root of 1,48 0 ( 38.5 × 38.5 = 1,482.25 ). And it may be contained by a rhombus having a perimeter of 360.6 , and by another 193.824 long, the latter number being rather more than the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac, if the sun’s dis - tance be taken at to ( 216 : 2,09 3 :: 20 : 193.6 ).

Secondly, a man standing crosswise within a square whose sides are 78.06 , would represent the Macrocosm according to the rule of Vitruvius. The diagonal of this square is 110 inches, or the radius of the sun's orbit, and a circle 110 in diameter has a circumference of 345 6 / 7 , o r 1 / 1 2 of the width of the sun's ark, containing the ecliptic measured upon a terrestrial globe. Thirdly, if the microcosm be inclosed within a square whose area is half that of the first, the circle sur - rounding his body has a circumference of 245 1 / 3 , or the numerical equivalent of Adam Kadmon. The sides of the smaller square measure 55 inches, or the number of miles in the diameter of the earth divided by 12 twice. According to the inferences drawn from the measures of the greatest pyramid, it may be sup - posed that it and the other two were built to symbolize the three persons of the Cabala. In their order the second pyramid would fall to micro - cosmos, and the measure of its square base is 706 1 / 1 2 and its diagonal 998.67 feet, its vertical height b eing 472 feet. Now if the microcosm were inclosed within the square base, and crucified upon a rood cross, its height would be 2,151 feet, or the number of years in the great month or Messianic period. By taking the diagonals at 999 feet, and bending them into two circles, after the manner of Plato in the “Timæus,” a vesica is formed 666 in circumference. Then 472 feet is the united width of the two circles producing a vesica whose perimeter is equal to 1 / 12 of the earth’s diameter in miles. It is a lso one more than the diameter of a circle 1,480 ( 471 × 3 1 / 7 = 1,480 ).

At least, the measures of this pyramid support such a view. The base is 346 1 / 12 feet square, and it is 213 2 / 3 feet high. The sides of a rhombus inscribed within the base are equal to those of the New Jerusalem ( 199.68 ), th e Bride of the Apocalypse, while the height, 213 2 / 3 , is the diameter of a circle 671 in circumference; and 671 is the numerical equivalent of Thora and Adonai, the names of the third person of the cabalistic triad. The width of the base, 346 1 / 12 , is ve ry nearly 1 / 12 of the width of the sun’s ark measured in miles on a terrestrial globe. Taking the equa - torial circumference at 24,900 miles, the external width would be ( 6 075 2 , ) = 345 6 / 7 . The distinguishing measures of the three pyra - m ids seem clearly to agree with the old doctrine of the Trinity, and if their heights be arranged in a triad: 481 1 / 3 481 1 / 3 481 472 472 213 – —— 213 2 / 3 } 685 2 / 3 —— 953 1 / 3 —— – 694 1,167 the sum of the numbers is 1,167 , or 1 / 12 of the side of a square whose area is equal to the surface of the earth. The numbers of the second and third added together give 685 2 / 3 , the diamete r of a circle 2,151 in circumference, an appropriate number for the King and Queen of Heaven. Then 953 1 / 3 , the sum of the first and second numbers, with the addi - tion of 2 , is the width of a vesica 1,656 long, or the number of miles from the equator to t he tropics, measured on the earth's circumference. And 694 is the width of a vesica formed by two intersecting circles inscribed within the Holy Oblation. It is well known that Herschel the astronomer ascertained that the entrance passage of the great"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 217 pyra mid pointed to that part of the heavens occupied by the pole star in the year 2,160 or 2,170 B . C . In Herschel’s day, this year agreed with the reputed age of the pyramid, and he consequently inferred that the passage had been built at this particular ang le to record the date of its erection. Professor Piazzi Smyth, however, afterwards calculated that the Pole Star was in the same position in the year 3,440 B . C ., and presumably it passed the same point at intervals, ages before that. Whatever the true da te may be it is probable that the Pyramids of Memphis, though less than 10,000 years old, may have been built to preserve the canon of the Egyptian priests. And Plato’s re - ference to the laws being laid up in the temples, suggests the conclusion that t he pyramids did actually “fix and exhibit patterns of them,” which became the established traditions of after times, and never changed. The Parthenon, like the pyramids, seems to have illustrated all the astronomical science of the Greeks. In treating o f its geometrical disposition there is this advantage, that the value of the foot by which it has been set out has been ascertained with comparative certainty.

As the virgin, mystically born from the forehead of Zeus, the Father, she appears to personate the divine essence in its feminine and immaterial aspect. But it is evident from the various myths related about her, that she was also conceived as a male and androgynous being, thus combining in her person all the powers of creation embodied in the cabalistic triad, and she seems to have been accepted as the cosmic divinity afterwards rele - gated to the Christian myt hos. The name Athene has the value of 76 ; it is the square root of 5,776 , or half of the sun’s distance measured by the earth’s diameter. She may therefore be said to represent one part of the two - fold principle of life. Again, 76 1 / 3 is the side of a sq uare whose diagonals measure 216 , the diameter the sun’s orbit; and 76 , with a fraction added, is also the square root of 5,920 , the perimeter of a square whose sides are 1,480 (Christos).

And by adding col el to each name this designation is equivalent by Gematria to DELFUS , the womb. But the name which was most commonly applied to Athene was Pallas, and her statues in the Parthenon represented her under this image. Pausanias tells us that the figure was wr ought of gold and ivory, standing erect clad in a long robe with a Medousa upon her breast. Her helmet was surmounted by a sphinx, and in one hand she held a spear, while in the other stood a victory four cubits high. At her feet lay a shield, and clo se beside the spear was a snake, which was supposed by Pausanias to be Erychthonios. And the birth of Pandora, the first woman, was depicted on the pedestal. The height of the statue was 26 cubits, 1 the number of the mystic Tetragrammaton. The Victory ( ΝΙΚΕ , 88 ), being 4 cubits, is 96 digits high, or the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac if the sun's distance be taken at 10 , and 88 is the space between the tropics, measured by the sun's diameter. All the symbols enumerated by Pausanias are doubtless att ributes, appropriate to some of her many forms.

The statue of Pallas was called Palladium. The most ancient of these mysterious images having been thrown down from Olympus by Zeus at Troy ( Tro...h , 488 ), was set up and worshipped by the Troja ns till it was taken by the Greeks and brought to Athens. The figure is said to have been “ 3 cubits in height, its legs close together, and holding in its right hand a spear, and in the left a spindle and distaff” (Smith’s Dict.). Now three cubits are equal to 54 inches, and 54 is the side of a square whose perimeter is 216 , and 54 with a fraction added is the square root of 2,946 , the diagonal of the Holy Oblation. Next to the Palladium the statue of Athene Polias was most highly revered. According t o Pausanias (bk. i., ch. 26 ) the Greeks were accus - tomed to dedicate this image in that part of each town which was called “the city.” Accordingly we may suppose that her statue thus set up symbolized the heavenly city called the Bride, or the New Jerus alem by the Christians. And the extreme length of the Parthenon being about 235 Greek feet, it would appear that this great sanctuary of the goddess was built according to the measure of her city in the sky. The name Parthenon, the virgin’s house, yields 1,095 , which is the width of two intersecting circles producing a vesica 365 broad; Ð Parqenèn has the numerical value of 1,165 - 2 = 1,163 , which is the length of a vesica 671 broad, and 671 is numeric - ally equivalent to Thora, the Hebrew Bride, to who m, in the person of the Virgin Mary, this temple was afterwards dedicated. The word Parq ™noj , applied both to Athene and Mary, has the value of 515 , which is 1 less than 516 , the mean between 512 and 520 ( 512 × 4 = 2,048 and 520 3 / 4 × 4 = 2,083 ). Accordingly, by the name Parthenos"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 221 the Pagan and Christian virgin symbolized the universe. And we find that the Parthenon, measured on the first step, is inclosed by a rhom - bus 515.228 long, formed by two intersecting circles whose united width is 891.675 , a figure which admirably expresses the significance of the two names in the Greek language , for 891 is the numerical equivalent of OÙranÒj , Heaven. If the classical temples were designed according to the rule of Vitruvius, so that their measures depended upon the proportions of the human body, we ought to find an illustration of it in the Parth e - non. The length of the cell externally, including the antæ, is 165.613 feet, and it is probable that a square inclosing it was intended to contain the lesser of the two pattern - figures. For, if this square be doubled, the larger square, containing the greater man, measures about 234 feet, or nearly the length of the temple measured on the first step. Thus the two main dimensions of the build - ing exemplify the duplication of the square as nearly as the exigencies would admit. The head of the les ser man then lies in the centre of the four pillars of the Opisthodomos, and the phallus falls upon the place chosen for the statue of Pallas. Moreover, the perimeter of the square inclosing his body is 662.452 ( 165.613 × 4 ) which is the diameter of a cir cle 2,081 in circumference. There - fore, with a small addition to the side of the square we get the measure of the Holy Oblation. Then the square surrounding the greater man has a perimeter of 936 ( 234 × 4 ), which is the length of a rhombus having a per imeter of 2,160 , the number of miles in the moon's diameter. The measures of the temple, taken on the first step, exclusive of the ledge, are 234.28 by 109.17 feet. The proportions, therefore, are very nearly those of a rood cross. If we suppose 109.17 , the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 222 extreme breadth of the temple, to be the length of the transverse beam of a cross in the ratio of 28 : 13 , its height will be 235.116 . If, on the other hand, we suppose the extreme length 234.28 to be the height of a cross, its transverse beam w ill be 108.77 . The first of the two crosses would be contained within the New Jerusalem ( 235.116 ), while each would crucify the macrocosm in a square whose sides are equal to a computation of the radius of the sun’s orbit. The rhombus appears to have be en similarly applied to the design of the Parthenon, as in the case of the Great Pyramid. For the whole building ( 234.28 × 109.17 feet) is contained in a rhombus, formed by the intersection of two circles which produce a vesica having a perimeter of 1,023 feet, or the radius of Saturn’s orbit. The perimeter of the top step is 650 1 / 4 feet, and is therefore the diameter of a circle whose circumference is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The perimeter of the first step, exclusive of the ledge, is 686.9 feet; if the ledge be included we get the diameter of a circle 2,162 in circum - ference of the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. The number of days in the solar and lunar years has also determined certain of the proportions of the building, for the upper platform is inclosed by a rhombus formed by two intersecting circles 365 1 / 4 feet in diameter, or the number o f days in the solar year, and the full length of the cell externally is that of a rhombus having a peri - meter of 354.6 , the number of days in the lunar year. A rectangle surrounding the cell externally has a perimeter of 471 feet, the diameter of a cir cle 1 ,480 in circumference, while the rhombus in"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 223 closing it has a perimeter equal to 1 / 1 2 of the number of miles in the earth's diameter. The external length of the cell exclusive of the antæ is 155.701 , and 155.79 × 9.5 = 1,480 . Its length from wall to wall above the sill is 155.54 , and a vesica 155.468 has a perimeter of 651.228 , which is the diameter of a circle 2,046 in circum - ference, or the mean diameter of Saturn’s orbit ( 651.228 × 3.1416 = 2,046 ). And the length between the outer faces of the door jambs is 155.48 , or the distance of the tropics from the equator, measured by the tone. The internal measures of the cell being 142.2 by 62.17 feet, its proportions are practically, those of the “cross of our L ord” described by Sir John Maundeville as being 144 × 63 inches. But Athene being primarily a feminine deity, the builders have made the perimeter of the cell 408.74 feet, and that is the length of a rhombus whose sides are equal to those of the New Jeru - salem. In this way the cross and vesica have be en mystically combined. The interior of the cell may also be inclosed by a rhombus about 249 1 / 4 long ( 249 1 / 4 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 ). The opisthodomos, the treasury (sometimes called treasuries) was apparently dedicated to the goddess, as the germinating essence, for the dia - gonals of this chamber measure 75 1 / 2 feet (Athene, 76 ). And by giving the measure in the two diagonals, the builders have suggested her double character. For the opisthodomos and naos to - gether must be taken to represent the abode of the d eity in the form of the mystical triad. Its perimeter round the cell is 207.484 , which is the diameter of a circle 651.9 , or the diameter of a circle whose circumference is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit.

The united width of the circ les by which it is produced is 258 , or 1 less than the value of Basileia, the third person of the cabalistic triad. The rhombus thus formed has a perimeter of 360.38 . The circum - ferences of the two circles added together amount to 1,081.142 , the radiu s of the moon’s diameter, and the numerical equivalent of tÒ pneàma “Agion , the Holy Ghost, who corresponds to Basileia. A cross inscribed within the vesica measures ( 86 + 149.058 =) 235.058 , or nearly the side of the New Jerusalem, the city personified both by Basileia 1 and the Christian bride. A square enclosing the whole figure has a perimeter of ( 258 x 4 =) 1,032 , or the mean radius of a circle between Saturn and the Zodiac. It has been supposed that Hestia, 516 , personified this circle, and by Gemat ria, Parthenos, 515 , is equivalent to Hestia. To the old priests looking for numerical harmonies this figure would certainly appear remarkable, and perhaps for this reason the Romans called every diagram such as this vesica 85 , being 1 less than 86 .And to the architect, seeking a proportion fit for the sanctuary of that goddess, whom they sought to make an image of the universal consonance of nature, such a figure would also appeal. The length of the naos is 96.78 feet, which 1 Basileia is mentioned in the “Birds” of Aristophanes. She is said to have charge of the thunderbolts of Zeus, and in the play marries the founder of the city in the clouds, which seems to be a pre - Christian version of the City of St. John. It o ccupied an intermediate position between the earth and the firmament, and was built by 40,000 birds. Now 40,000 is the area of the New Jerusalem ( 200 2 = 40,000 ).

The diameter of the two circles forming the rhombus which con - tains the naos is 235 1 / 2 feet, or the length of the side of the New Jerusalem, and the p erimeter of the rhombus thus produced is 471.6 , while the perimeter of the vesica enclosing it is 495 , or 1 less than the value of the name Malchuth, the bride. The word Pallas is generally considered to be identical with phallus, and the division of th e c ell into two parts accords with the idea of the cross, for the front chamber of the temple called naos (the ship or nave), containing the great statue of Pallas, has a perimeter of 317.9 , and 317.9 × 4 = 1,271.6 , the numerical equivalent of stauros , a cross. The statue was said to be 26 cubits or 39 feet high; and 26 multiplied by 9 1 / 2 produces 247 , a number doubly suited to measure this icon of Pallas. Firstly, 247 is the length of the transverse beam of a rood - cross 532 high and 760 over all . Now 760 is the side of a square whose diagonals measure 2,151 , the number of years in the great month; and the height 532 is the length of a vesica formed by two circles having a united width of 920.7 and a common diameter of 613.8 . The number 532 is the value of the name Atlas, who was fabled to bear up the whole world on his shoulders; 921 is the numeric - ally equal to the Greek word canon , and there were said to be 613 precepts in the Hebrew law. Secondly, by reducing the 26 cubits by a small amount, we find that 25.98 × 9.5 = 246.792 ; and a cross of this height has a transverse beam 114.589 , and will consequently crucify the Logos in a circle having a circumference of 360 , the number of degrees in the earth’s circumference."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 226 Again, then, a circle described round th is cross has a circumference equal to the perimeter of the Holy Oblation, if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 ( 246.792 × 3.1416 = 4 321 775 . = 193.830 ). And 246.792 cubits are equal to 1,480.752 palms; in like manner the number 25.98 gives the height of the microcosm inclosed in a square, having a peri - meter of 1,480.752 . Also a vesica 246.792 broad is formed by two intersecting circles whose united width is 740.376 , the circumference of a circle inscribed within the New Jerusalem. Lastl y, the word Qhr...on , the beast in the Apocalypse whose number was 666 , and whose mark was the cross, has the value of 247 , and possibly the number 248 mentioned in the cabala (“Greater Holy Assembly,” 968 ) was chosen because it is the mean between 246.792 and 249.264 . The height of the temple from the pavement to the apex of the eastern pediment is 1,025.6 digits, or a large computation of the radius of Saturn’s orbit. From the floor of the peristyle to the apex of the pediment under the cymatium is 226.8 4 palms, and 226.84 × 9.5 = 2,155 the mean number between 2,151 and 2,160 . The height of the columns and entablature is 176.28 palms, and 176.28 × 9.5 = 1,674.6 , or very nearly the side of a square whose diagonals are 2,368 . The four angle - columns being 540.48 digits high, their united height amounts to 2,161.9 digits, or the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. It has been suggested that the area of 10,000 feet attributed to the tent at Delphi is contained within the walls of the cell. Now a parallelogram 150 × 66 2 / 3 feet incloses this area, and is contained within the walls. And if it be supposed that the plan"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 227 of the Parthenon was set out according to the proportions of Solomon's temple, as given by Laurencio de San Nicolas 1 ( 1663 ) on p. 50 , and that the length of the Holy Place, and Holy of Holies are too, and 50 feet respectively, then, their united lengths are 150 feet, agreeing with the length of the parallelogram containing 10,000 square feet. And besides this coincidence it will be found that upon drawin g the temple of Solomon according to the above proportions on the plan of the Parthenon, that the division between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is marked by the partition between the naos and opisthodomos, and the centre of the opisthodomos, in the middle of the four columns, coincides with the centre of the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s temple. The arrangement of the four columns so exactly agrees with the ciborium of the churches, after - wards raised by the Christian Greeks, that we probably se e in the Parthenon the prototype of the arrangements of the Christian Church. There is no doubt that Solomon’s temple formed the pattern of the Christian churches, and the ark occupied the centre of the Holy of Holies. Now it is well known that the alta r of the first Christian churches placed under the ciborium was in the form of an ark, containing relics of the saints, and was an obvious type of the ark of the Covenant. The four columns were also preserved in the Gothic churches, at the crossing of t he nave and transepts. Another circumstance connecting the plan with this theoretical temple of Solomon is, that the Holy Place, or naos, is 100 feet long, and may have been the true origin of the name Heca - tompedon.

Antiquaries have been a good deal divided in their opinions as to the antiquity of the remains at Stonehenge, for although, perhaps, no one ex - cept Inigo Jones ever thought that this ancient structure was a Roman temple, some persons have considered that it might have been set up after the Roman invasio n. There is certainly no authentic evidence in existence as to its age. From the nature of the work it might reasonably be judged to belong to the most ancient form of building in the world, for nothing ruder or more primitive can be conceived as the mea ns of inclosing a sacred place for divine worship. As we have no knowledge at all of the early inhabitants of Britain, except what we learn from a few references in late classical authors, it is useless to speculate as to who really were the builders of S tonehenge. We may, in fact, assume anything or nothing. The work has generally been connected with the Druids, who presumably built it, if it is not the work of an earlier race. Several classical writers have spoken of the British Islands, and appear to have heard some rumours of the customs and character of the people. Diodorus quotes Hecatæus as having said that “The Hyperboreans inhabited an island beyond Gaul, as large as Sicily, in which Apollo was worshipped in a circular temple, considerable for its size and riches.” Then Dionysius Periegetes (v. 565 , etc.) says that the rites of Dionysus were duly celebrated in the British Islands. And we are told by Strabo that “In an island close to Britain, Ceres and Proserpina are venerated with rite s similar to the orgies of Samothrace” (Geog. bk. iv.). The Testimony of Julius Cæsar, who"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 229 obtained his information at first hand, ought to be strictly veracious and reliable. He declares that the Druids “deemed it unlawful to commit their statutes to writing; though in other matters, whether public or private, they make use of Greek characters . They seem to me to follow this method for two reasons: to hide their mysteries from the knowledge of the vulgar: and to exercise the memory of their scholars . . . . They likewise teach many things relating to the stars and their motions, the magnitude of the world and our earth. . . . Mercury is the chief deity with them: of him they have many images, account him the inventor of all arts. . . . Next to him ar e Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva. . . . Apollo is their god of physic, Minerva, of works and manufactures: Jove holds empire of heaven, and Mars presides in war. . . . The Gauls fancy themselves to be descended from the god Pluto” (“Gallic Co m - mentaries,” bk. vi., ch. 13 ). We have also the statement of Pomponius Mela, the Roman Ge - ographer (lib. iii., cap. 2 ), 2That the Gauls have their masters of eloquence and wisdom from the Druids. These profess that they know the mag - nitude and form of the earth and world; they teach many noble persons of their nation privately .” Finally, Hippolytus (Ref., bk. i., ch. 22 ) tells us that, “The Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean Philosophy.” If all these writers are to b e believed, and there is no particular reason to doubt them, we should certainly expect to find that an ancient British or Druidical temple was constructed in a similar manner to those of Greece and Egypt. The state - ment of Cæsar and the other historian s, that the worship of Dionysus, Apollo, Ceres, etc., existed in Britain has been thought to expose the ignorance or credulity of those old writers, but, as a matter"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 230 of fact, there is nothing surprising in such state - ments, when it is recognized, that th e powers in - voked under these names were the gods of all ancient peoples, however they might be called in different places; and the statement of Hecatæus as to the circular temple of Apollo, or the sun, seems to agree very well with the facts which may be deduced from the measures of Stone - henge. Mr. Davies (“Mythology and Rites of the British Druids”) has given the translation of a poem called the Gododin, supposed to have been written about A.D. 510 , by a Briton of Northum - bria. The bard describe s the massacre of the 360 Britons which took place at Stonehenge in 472 . The poem contains several allusions which appear to relate to that structure. The mystical sanctuary which is referred to by the bard is called “The Stone Cell of the Sacred Fire ,” that is, the ark or coffer of the sun. It is also called \"The Great Stone Fence,” “The Ark of the World,” and “The Circle of the World.” And the name Caer Sidi , the seat of Sidi or Saturn, was applied to it, so that the beings who were worshipped i n this mysterious circle appear to be no other than the universal cosmic deities. Fortunately, Stonehenge, like the Great Pyramid, has been measured by Mr. Petrie, so we are in possession of absolutely trustworthy measurements to work upon. There will be n o great improbability in sup - posing that we have inherited our present standard measures from our remote ancestors, who built their sanctuary on Salisbury Plain. Consequently it will be assumed, that Stonehenge is set out according to the present standa rd of British measure. The inside diameter of the outer circle of the temple is given as being 1,167.9 inches. Now the"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 231 side of a square whose area equals the surface of the earth divided by 12 measures 1,167 1 / 2 miles, or almost exactly the diameter of t he circle. Again, 1,170 inches is 97 1 / 2 feet ( 12 170 1 , = 97 1 / 2 ) therefore the outer circle of stones at Stonehenge will nearly surround an ark of the same size as that in the Great Pyramid, measured by feet instead of inches. And this wou ld appear to be the “stone cell of the sacred fire,” or the ark of the sun, whose length measures the limits of the sun's course in the ecliptic. And it is said in the Gododin, “in the circle of the world it was his choice to have Eidiol, the harmoniou s,” Eidiol being the sun, according to Davies. Then 96.8 is the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac surrounding Saturn's orbit, if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 . And 1,168 inches = 97 1 / 3 feet ÷ 2 = 48 2 / 3 , the square root of the number 2,368 , which may be written in Greek letters as IESOUS CHRISTOS . The only one of the inner circles which is defined is 472.7 inches in diameter; but it is rather irregular, and may very well be taken at 471 , whi ch would give it a circumference of 1,480 inches. Mr. Petrie thinks, that this circle may be of later date than other parts of the building. The arrangement of the smaller stones is rather uncertain, but the inclination of the two upper trilithons, on ei ther side of the altar, appears to be that of the sides of a pentalpha. Accordingly, if a pentalpha touching the trilithons be drawn within a pentagon, having a perimeter of 416 2 / 3 feet, the sides of the pentalpha will be 132 × 5 = 660 1 feet or 7,920 inches, the number of miles in the earth’s diameter. 1 This may possibly be inaccurate."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 232 If the builders of Stonehenge founded their design upon the measures of the ark, which is found in the Great Pyramid, the question arises, whether the Egyptians received their knowledge from the people who built Stonehenge, or whether the latter, as the ingenious Godfrey Higgins supposed, were a colony of Egyptians. If this last opinion be true, it seems strange that a people capable of executing a work, constructed with the utmost science and showing an advanced knowledge of building, should have been content to erect a rude monument like the temple of Stonehenge. But a question of this kind might lead to endless theorizing, which probably could never lead to any satisfac tory conclusion. The Pantheon may be taken as the best remain - ing example of the classical temples of Rome. From the inscription over the portico we learn that “Having been impiously dedicated of old by Agrippa to Jupiter and all the Gods, it was pious ly reconsecrated by Pope Boniface the Fourth to the Blessed Virgin and all the Saints.” Serlio, the architect, describing it in 1540 , says, “Among all the ancient buildings to be seene in Rome, I am of opinion that the Pantheon (for one piece of work alo ne) is the fayrest, wholest, and best to be under - stood; and it is so much the more wonderfull than the rest, because it hath so many members, which are all so correspondent one to another, that whoso - ever beholdeth it, taketh great pleasure therein, wh ich proceedeth from this, that the excellent workeman, which invented it, chose the perfitest forme, that is, the round forme, whereby it is usually called, Our Lady of the Round; for within it is as high as it is broad.” Further on, he con - tinues: “Th e widenesse of the whole Temple (that is of the floore within, from one wall to another) is 194 Palmes: and just so much is the height from the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 233 floore to the undermost stone of the window above” (“Architettura,” bk. iii., ch. iv.). He gives on the margi n of the page the length of the old Roman palm by which he measured the Temple. It is divided into twelve fingers, and these again are divided into four minutes. Palladio, about thirty years later, made much more accurate plans, and says that it was mad e in the form of the world. Now since the diameter of the sphere of the Zodiac is 193.6 , taking the sun’s distance at 10 , the interior of the Temple would contain the whole world, and the dome being an exact hemi - sphere surrounding the firmament, it is a literal representation of the vault of heaven. This may account for the remark of Serlio, that of all the temples, it was “the best to be understood.” The reasons for believing that the geometrical principles of design, found in the Gothic cathedrals, for med the secret of the Freemasons, have already been laid before the reader. And it has been supposed that the diagrams of Cesariano applied to the cathedral at Milan, are an exposition of those principles. If those assumptions, therefore, are correct, it is to be expected that a similar system will be found in other mediæval cathedrals built by the Freemasons. Apparently, all the sacred buildings erected in the Middle Ages are alike in this respect, and, as it is easy for anyone to apply Cesariano’ s system to any cathedral - plan, we shall not tire the reader by giving long descriptions of its application to different churches. It will be enough to draw attention to some of the measures of Westminster Abbey, which is one of the most perfect example s of mediæval building in Europe, and is likely to exhibit the geometrical methods of its builders, as well as any other structure. The two great churches of London and West -"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 234 minster, dedicated to Sts. Paul and Peter, were founded upon the sites of temples of Diana and Apollo (Dugdale, “History of St. Paul’s,” p. 3 ). And although the good Dugdale was greatly scandalized at the idolatry of the ancient Lon - doners, nevertheless, it would appear that the worshippers of the true God carried on the tra - ditions of their predecessors with tolerable success. Theophilus Gale tells us that the “canonized saints are parallel to the pagan demons ( Da...monej ), as to their origin and formal canonization, so in like manner in point of office, as mediators between God a nd men” (“Court of the Gentiles,” vol. iii., p. 180 ). And according to Bochart, “the wor - shippers of Christ transferred to their saints all the equipage of the pagan gods; to St. Wolfang, the hatchet or hooke of Saturne; to Moses, the hornes of Jupiter Hammon; to St. Peter, the keys of Janus” (see also Joseph Mede, “Apostasie of the Latter Times,” 1644 ). According to Mede and Gale, the dedication of Christian churches to a particular saint was the perpetuation of the old pagan practice, which caused t he Athenians to devote the Parthenon to Pallas Athene. And, just as the measures of the Greek temple were derived from the numbers of the names attributed to the goddess, so also we find that the number 755 ( PETROS ) seems to have determined some of the proportions of the Abbey of Westminster. As Camden and other old writers have informed us, the idolatrous people of Westminster worshipped the sun or Apollo; and it has been already shown, in reference to the Pyramid, that a stone or hexagon, which me asures 755 from point to point, contains the sun’s ark ( 691 × 115 ), and a stone or hexagon having a perimeter of 755 encloses the sun’s orbit 217 in diameter."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLES. 235 Now the great church dedicated by the Christians of Westminster to the canonized and sanctified stone, Petros, 755 , measures externally across the transepts about 220 feet. That is to say, if the sun’s orbit be drawn with the middle of the cross under the great tower as a centre, the course of the sun would pass the outside limit of the north doo rway. Then the external measurement of the wall of the nave appears to be 89 1 / 2 feet, or the space between the tropics measured by the sun’s diameter. And the rhombus, touching the north - west corner of the building, incloses the main part of the chur ch, and has a perimeter of 1,656 , the altitude of the ecliptic above the equator measured in miles. Moreover, the rhombus, touching the same point, but drawn horizontally, has a peri - meter of 2,368 . A hexagon or cubical stone 755 in circuit marks the outside of the wall of the north transept, while a pentalpa, whose perimeter is 755 , seems to determine the inside line of the east wall of the transepts. If the temple of Solomon be drawn, so that the centre of the Holy of Holies falls upon the middle of the four piers of the great tower, it will be found to cover the space occupied by the choir. The present choir stalls and screen are, of course, modern, but they are in the same place as those shown upon Hollar’s plan, engraved in the middle of th e seventeenth century.

A square whose sides are 365 set diagonally with its centre on the middle of the great tower incloses Henry VII’s chapel and touches the western door. The height of the nave or ship (if it be the same as that of the south transept 1 ) is 104 1 / 5 feet, or the height of an ark 1,042 long, and 1,042 is the radius of the Holy Oblation. From the west wall of the north transept to the apse is 155.79 feet. From the entrance of the choir to the apsidal end of the arcade is 249 1 / 4 feet. It will be noticed that Islip’s Chapel forms the corner of a square described round the centre of the building, and this square has a perimeter of 512 feet.

But it may be that this chamber is built to hold the head of a woman whose body is proportionate to it; in that case her body would be 462 feet long, for the house is nearly 58 feet across, a nd the figure of Vitruvius is 8 heads high. The Chapter House was built in the thirteenth century, when the cult of the Virgin was at its highest popularity among the scholastic theologians, and it is probable that the builders would seek to include in t heir design the feminine image of the divine power. The Chapter House of West - minster was finished about the year 1260 , the date at which the new age of the Holy Ghost was pre - dicted to begin.

I N the traditions and ritual of modern Free - masonry, we have the remains of those philosophi - cal doctrines, which at one time guided the practice of architecture. Whatever uncerta inty there may be as to the precise secrets of the old operative masons, it is evident that the rites which are said to have been formulated for the first time in the eighteenth century, were not a brand new inven - tion. For it may be asserted — and this is con - firmed by many contemporary evidences — that the establishment of the present forms of initiation and instruction was the attempt of certain mys - tics of that time, to preserve the ancient secrets of architecture from sinking into the oblivion which was rapidly overtaking the lapsed craft of opera - tive Freemasonry. And the new dilettanti masons seem to have been sufficiently instructed in the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 239 mystical traditions, still existing at that time, to compose the degrees in accordance with the old system , so they may be taken as tolerably reliable expositions of the ideas which governed the practice of their predecessors. Building was not the only art or science which had its symbolical secrets, but the Freemasons depended entirely on the Church for thei r sup - port, consequently, when the Reformation began to discourage the secret discipline as a part of the teaching of theology, masons of the old instructed kind were no longer employed to build the churches. The disuse of symbolical architecture, howev er, does not seem to have come about till after the time of Sir Christopher Wren, for it is known that he was the master of an operative lodge, and that Freemasons were employed in building St. Paul’s, the last of the old cathedrals. We are told that “ The highest or last stone on the top of the Lantern was laid by the hands of the surveyor’s son, Christopher Wren, deputed by his father, in the presence of that excellent artificer, Mr. Strong, his son, and other Free and Accepted Masons chiefly emplo yed in the execution of the work.” (“Parentalia,” p. 293 .) The coming to light of sorts of mystical know - ledge that had been carefully concealed in previous times, is one of the noticeable features of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But it is a mistake to suppose that for this reason these cen - turies were peculiarly given to mysticism, on the contrary, the appearance in the seventeenth century of Rosicrucian, Hermetic, and Masonic Societies was a sign of decadence, and the pre - monition of the f inal extinction of the esoteric traditions of antiquity. As long as the secret doctrines of masonry were received as the vital inspiration of the craft, no one heard anything"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 240 about them, and the same thing applies to theology itself. In fact the mysteri es, which in the past were only spoken in secret and never written, became faintly heard when their power had prac - tically ceased. It is not to be expected that a society, whose secrets were communicated orally, should have records to prove the nature of its mysteries, there - fore it is to the monuments, which the mediæval masons have everywhere left behind them, that we must look for the evidence of their practical methods; while the ritual, however doubtful its antiquity may be, is the best and only sur viving instance of those mystical initiations which pre - vailed in the pagan world. All intelligent masons agree that, notwithstanding the alterations which may have been made to the ceremonies during the eighteenth century, certain forms of initiation in use from time immemorial were required “to make a mason.” In the Lansdowne manuscript ( 1560 ), it is said, “These be all the charges . . . read at the making of a mason” (Mackenzie’s “Cyclop.”). But the ancient ritual may well have been a com - parative ly simple affair, when it is understood that the chief business of an operative mason was to learn the principles of his craft. And it is obvious that this would have to be done in some more practical way than by a purely symbolical cere - mony, which was quite sufficient, however, for the theoretic masons of the last century. And it is probable that all the modern degrees were an attempt to reduce to a ceremonial order some of the practices actually forming a part of the ancient architectural methods of design. It would be manifestly inexpedient that the profounder secrets of theology should be intrusted to young and ignorant apprentices, so that there would naturally arise a practical necessity for progressive degrees"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 241 of instruction, leading up to th e full knowledge of the esoteric rules which constituted the archi - tectural canon. The early Freemasons, being the ecclesiastical workmen, were authorized by the Pope, who was regarded as their head. They were exempted from taxation, and had other privi leges; and “the papal briefs, which protected them, alleged that such immunities were given them after the example of Hiram, King of Tyre, when he sent artisans to King Solomon for the purpose of building the temple at Jerusalem.” At that time many of t he masters were bishops and abbots, while the monks worked as journeymen in the different crafts. Although there is no direct documentary evid - ence giving a straightforward explanation of the Masonic mysteries, there are various traditions which profess t o give an account of the origin and purpose of the craft. Modern masons, who do not understand the symbolical mode of communica - tion, regard these traditions as worthless fictions, deserving no serious consideration. We venture, however, to take another view of the case, and an analysis of the following quotation from a docu - ment, published in the “Gentleman’s Magazine” (June, 1815 ), will show that the statements of the old masons, like those of the priests, were pub - lished in the form of grotesque his torical allegory, for the sole purpose, apparently, of deceiving those who were considered to be unfit to appreciate the simple truth. “Good Breetheren and Fellowes: Our purpose is to tell you how and in what manner this worthy science of Masonrye was be gunne. . . .

Before Noyes Floode, there was a man called Lameche, as it is writte n in the Byble, in the fourth chapter of Genesis: and this Lameche had two wives, and the one height Ada and the other height Sella: by his first wife Ada he gott two sons, and that one Jabell and thother Tuball, and by that other wife Sella he got a son and a daughter. All these children founden the beginning of all the sciences in the world. And this elder son Jabell found the science of Geometrie, and he departed flocks of sheepe and lambs of the field, and first wrought house of stone and tree, as is noted in the chapter above said. And his brother Tubal found the science of Musicke, songe of tongue, harpe and orgaine. And the third son, Tuball Cain, found smithcraft of gold, silver, and copper, iron and steel: and the daughter found the cra fte of Weav - inge. And these children knew well that God would take vengeance for synn, either by fire or by water; wherefore they writt their science that they had found in two pillars of stone, that they might be found after Noyes Floode. And that"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 243 o ne stone was marble, for that would not bren with fire; and that other stone was clepped laterns, and would not drown in noe water. “Our intent is to tell you trulie, and in what manner these stones were found, that these sciences were written in. The G reet Hemarynes that was Cubys son, the which Cub was Sem’s son, that was Noys son. This Hemarynes after - wards was called Harmes, the father of wise men; he found one of the two pillars of stone, and found the science written here, and he taught it to other men. And at the making of the tower of Babylon, there was Masonry first made much of. And the Kinge of Babylon, that height Nemrothe, was a Mason himself. . . . And this was the first tyme that ever Mason had any charge of his science. “Moreover , when Abraham and Sara his wife went into Egypt, there he taught the seaven sciences to the Egiptians, and he had a worthy Scoller that height Ewclyde, and he learned right well, and was a master of all the VII sciences liberall. And in his days it bef ell, that the lond and the estates of the realme had so many sonnes . . . . and they had not competent livehode to find with their children . . . . And they did crye through all the realme, if there were any man that could informe them, that he should c ome to them. . . . “After that this crye was made, then came this worthy clarke Ewclyde, and said to the Kinge and to all his great lords, ‘If yee will take me your children to governe, and to teach them one of the seaven Scyences, wherewith they may li ve honestly as gentlemen should, under a condition that yee will grant me and them a commission, that I may have power to rule them after the manner that the science ought to be ruled!

And thus was the scyence grounded there: and that worthy M r Ewclide gave it the name of geome - trie. And now it is called through all this land Masonrye.” It is first to be noticed, that Masonry is said to be identical wit h geometry, the fifth of the sciences, which teaches the measure of the earth. This definition is to be found in all the old accounts of the craft, and whatever else may be mythical in these histories, this at least may be taken literally. As heretofo re, it will be found that the numbers of names play the same part in the Masonic parables as in the case of other mystical writings. It has been previously suggested that the cabalistic process of Gematria was practised by other peoples besides the Hebre ws and Greeks, and the English Freemasons seem to have applied that system of numbers to the names used in their science. In the preceding document we are told that Lameche was the father of Masonry. Now, in the Greek, L£mec has the numerical value of 676 , the square of 26 . And 26 , the number of Tetra - grammaton, was also in England the number of letters in the alphabet, which (according to the book of Yetsirah), together with the Sephiroth, are the foundation of all things. And the word Masonrye has th e value of 676 , supposing the English letters to have the same value as the Hebrew; while the more modern spelling of the word, without the final e, gives it the value of 671 — the number of the Bride — and confirms the Ionic tendency of English Masonry. In corroboration of this, Vitruvius (bk. i., ch. ii.) says that archi - tecture consists of order, arrangement, and eco - nomy. These names are given in Greek ( t£xij , di£qesij , o„konom...a ), and are numerically equal to"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 245 1,351 . If colel be added we get 1,352 , which is the measure of a cross whose limbs are each 676 long. Again, the name Lameche treated in the same way gives the number 89 , which is the square root of the earth's diameter in miles ( 89 2 = 7,921 ). And Lameche was, in the order of the patriarchal giants, the ninth from Adam, and corresponds to the step Yesod of the Cabala. In this capacity he may be said to be the symbol of the generative power of the sun, for the distance between the tropics, or the limit of the solar path, is 89 1 / 2 dia - meters of the sun. And Lameche, with his two wives (Ada, 6 , and Sella, 366 ), complete a triad ( 89 + 6 + 366 ) numerically equal to 461 , which is 1 less than the height of a cross whose area measures a rood of 40 perches or 660 feet or 7,920 inches in length. In Hebrew the name Lamech (LMK) has the value of 90 , which is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 360 , while Tubal Cain (TUBL QIN) yields 1,248 which is the width of a vesica 2,163 long, or the number of miles in the moon’s diameter, and may symbolize the Tone. The numbers of the five names, de - ducting colel from each, amount to 1,003 , or 1 more than 1,002 , the limb of the cross described by Plato 1 in the “Timæus.” Tubal, it is said, founded the science of Musicke, 384 , the number of Pluta rch's soul of the world, and the measure of the sun’s distance computed by the tone. And Tubal Cain yields 1,183 = ( 469 + 714 ); he is called the first worker in metals, and the value of his name is one less than the half of the number, 2,368 ( 1,184 × 2 ). It would take too long to discuss all the numbers which occur in the piece, but it may be noticed that the name Noye yields 135 , or the vertical 1 According to the tradition Plato had been instructed in Masonry, and was claimed as an ancient brother."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 246 height of the tropic above the equator on a globe 660 in diameter. Hemarynes has the numerical value of 616 , the number of the beast according to some of the manuscripts of the Apocalypse. Then Nernroth yields 735 , which is the width of a vesica 1,275 long, and 1,275 is the height of a cross, which will crucify a man in a square whose perimeter is 2, 368 . Ewclyde appears to be brought in to show that the Greeks were fully instructed in Masonry. His name yields 69 , and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 68 is 2,346 , so that 69 may stand for 2,368 . It is possible, also, that there is an arcanum hidde n beneath this account of the seven sciences, for the sum of the numbers deduced from the English names given here is 5,261 , which divided by 7 gives 751 , but 5,261 may also be taken as the perimeter of a square inclosing a rhombus whose width is 758 . Now if 2 be taken from 758 and added to 751 , the numbers become 753 and 756 , the one being the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2,368 , and the other being the height of rood cross whose extreme measure is 1,080 . These Scyences, 676 , there fore involved the knowledge of Jesus Christ, who personated the cosmos mystically embodied in the measures of His cross. The same sciences are dealt with at some length in the cosmographical treatise called “The Mirrour of the Worlde,” translated by Caxton, and published by him in the year 1480 . To Christians who were fond of numerical analogies, the year whose number corresponded with the name of Christos would be a notable one , and this cosmic work — the only book printed in England in that year — w as probably considered suitable to the occasion. And the word “Scyences” having the same numerical value as “Masonrye,” namely, 676 , they are by Gematria equivalent to"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 247 one another, and are appropriately introduced into the parable to illustrate the meani ng of the Masonic craft. In the treatise of Vitruvius there are certain rules laid down as to the proportions of columns for the practical guidance of architects. These rules are said to have been derived from the writings and monuments of the Greeks. No Greek treatise on architecture exists at the present day, nor is there any exact uniformity in the pro - portions of the columns of Greek temples. The rules must, therefore, be taken independently upon their own merits. There is reason to believe th at this method of measuring columns is connected with the mystical practice of architecture set forth here as obscurely as elsewhere. Although modern architects no longer proportion their buildings according to a scale of modules, as Vitruvius directs, that system has only been dropt within comparatively recent times. Alberti, whose book on building is the next in point of age to that of Vitruvius, lived nearly 1,500 years after his master, nevertheless he scrupulously advocated the same principles, a nd the other architects of the Re - nascence followed in his steps. It may be con - cluded, therefore, that the later architects had good reasons for accepting these rules, and for continuing to use them. We are told by Vitruvius (bk. iv., ch. i.), that ther e are three sorts of columns, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The names and proportions con - nected with these three columns have evidently been assigned with a mystical purpose, as an analysis of their numbers will show. The Doric was the oldest col umn, and was first made of the proportion of six to one, in imitation of the body of a man, as it is said, whose foot was found to be the sixth part of his height. Then they made the"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 248 Ionic column according to the proportion of a woman, and made its hei ght eight times its thick - ness. Lastly, Kallimachos invented a still more slender and graceful proportion for the Corinthian column in imitation of the slim figure of a young virgin. “Thus two orders were invented, one of a masculine character without o rnament, the other bearing a character which resembled the delicacy, ornament, and proportion of a female.” These three columns have the greatest archi - tectural importance, for they are the distinguishing features of the three great types of design applied to all classical temples. They apparently symbol - ize the Macrocosm, the Microcosm, and the Bride or Virgin of the Cabala, the three personifications of the architectural canon. The Doric column, if it signified the Macrocosm, would be designed as the emblem of the original cause of all things, and according to the mystical account of Vitruvius it is to be conceived as a type of the upper Triad of the Cabala, set forth by the father, Hellen, 123 , his wife, Orseis, 588 , and Doros, 1,174 , their son. Th e original proportion of the Doric column being six to one, the ratio of Noah’s ark, it was said to have been based upon the human form. In the Greek language, K...wn DwrikÒj (Doric column) is equivalent to the number 2,084 , the side of the Holy Oblation. It was also called K...wn Dèriaj , 2,003 , or 1 less than the number produced from the four elements described by Plato in the “Timæus,” and from Ð k...wn Dèriaj we get 2,073 , or 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s circumference in miles. The name Dîroj yields 1,174 , and this is the length of a rhombus whose width is 677 , which is 1 more than the square of 26 , and 1 less than the length of the sun’s orbit. The Doric column, therefore, may be said to be the symbol of the generative"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 249 power of the universe, expressed by the sun, which of all the celestial bodies most conspicuously appears to measure the whole extent of the cosmic system. The method of measuring the proportion of a column is described by Vitruvius in bk. iii., ch. iii., where we are told that the thicknes s of a column is to be 2 modules, and this has always been the received principle among architects. Each module was further divided into 30 parts, so that the thick - ness of every column, no matter what its size may be, is always a measure of 6 o parts, a nd those parts form the basis of a proportionate scale of measurement throughout the building. Now every Doric column whose height is 6 times its thick - ness, is 360 parts high, or the number of degrees in the circumference of any circle — the sun’s orbit for instance — or the earth's circumference. 1 And these 2 modules have also a symbolical import, as the foundation upon which every column was supposed to stand. The numerical value of the name Doros, and those of his father and mother, when added to - get her amount to 1,885 ( Dîroj , 1,174 , “Ellhn , 123 , 'Orshij , 588 ), which is the perimeter of a rhombus 1 The architects of the Renascence considered that the most perfect proportions had been realized in the Templeof “Jupiter Stator” in the Forum at Rome. The height of the Order is given at 762.91 parts. Now a square 763 is enclosed b y a rhombus inscribed within the Holy Oblation. The height of the shaft being 606 1 / 3 parts is very nearly the circumference of the zodiac, taking the sun’s distance at 10 . Then the height of the column and architrave is 649.83 , or nearly the diamete r of Saturn’s orbit. It the Pattern - temples described by Vitruvius, and the designs published by Alberti, Serlio, Vignola, Palladio, and other architects of the sixteenth century be computer in the same way, it will be found that they also are illustra tions of the harmonious order of the universe, accepted as the canon of beauty by all the artists of antiquity."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 250 whose sides are 471 , the diameter of a circle 1,480 in circumference. The number 1,885 is also the sum of the diagonals of a square whose sides are 666 . According to Vitruvius, Hellen and Orseis reigned over Achaia, 613 , and Peloponnesos, 913 , both names yielding mystical numbers already discussed. The name Hellen and that of his wife Orseis, are numerically equal to 711 , or 2 more than the side of a sq uare whose diagonals measure 2,004 ; while 588 + 1,174 = 1,762 , or the circum - ference of a circle 532 in diameter. Now the length of a vesica 532 broad is 921 , the value of the name Kanèn (Canon). The invention of the Ionic column is ascribed by Vitruviu s to the Asiatic colony of 13 cities, founded by Ion, 860 , the son of Xouthos, 709 , and Chreousa, 796 . When the Ionians were about to build a temple to Artemis and “seeking a new proportion, they used the female figure as the standard.” Modern philolog ists have frequently derived the word Ionic from the Oriental Yoni, whose symbol is the vesica. The Ionic was the most ancient form of Greek philosophy, and was introduced by Thales, celebrated for his observa - tions of the Lesser Bear, KunÒsoura , 1,311 . By Gematria, Cynosoura is equivalent to Tetragram - maton, and she is the feminine of the two. 1 A rhombus — the Ionic symbol — which is 1,311 long, is 756 broad, and this is the height of a cross whose extreme measure is 1,080 , the number of miles in the moo n's radius, and the numerical value of tÒ Pneàma “Agion , the Holy Ghost of the Christians. By adding colel to 248 , the value of the name of the first Ionic philosopher, we get 249 , and 294 1 / 4 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 . Again the sum of the numbers of the 1 Arctos, the Great or masculine Bear, has the value of 691 , the length of the sun’s orbit ( 220 × 3 1 / 7 = 691 )."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 251 name Ion, and those of his father and mother, when colel is added to each, amounts to 2,368 . 709 + 1 796 + 1 860 + 1 } 1,658 —— 2,365 + 3 = 2,368. The design of the Ionic column is primarily distinguished by its double character, marked by the tw o spiral volutes of its capital. It would seem that the Greeks connected this number, 2,368 , not only with the feminine symbolism of the number 2 , associated specially with the Ionic column, but that it was also regarded as an emblem of the masculo - fem inine potency of the Logos. For the number 2 may express cabalistically both the second step and the second person of the great Triad, composed of the six steps intermediate between the first Triad and the tenth step. There - fore the Ionic system incl udes the two first prin - ciples of life, joined together in the person of the Microcosm or Logos, who in a manner epitomized all the philosophy of the ancients. Moses appears to have been, like Thales, an Ionic philosopher, for the numerical value of his name signifies the period of the equinoxes, which divide the year into two parts ( 345 1 / 2 × 2 = 691 , the length of the sun’s orbit measuring the space of the year), and 345 is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is equal to the number of miles in the moon’s radius — the moon being the feminine of the two great lights of the heavens. An d he attributed the creation of the world to the twofold Deity called the Elohim. And just as the universe was built by a twofold agency, so the temple of Solomon, designed in"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 252 imitation of the greater world, was built by the two kings, Solomon and Hiram. The walls of Troy were also built by Apollo and Poseidon. Kadmos and Harmonia built the city of Thebes; the Aloadæ, Otos and Ephialtes, are said to have founded the city Aloeum; and the invention of brick building was attributed to the two brothers, Euryalos and Hyperbios. Thus the creative powers were commonly symbolized in a double form, and are identical with the two intersecting circles of the Ionic vesica, and are reproduced in the two volutes of the Ionic capital. It is said that 8 letters w ere added in later times to the primitive Greek alphabet of Kadmos, consisting of 16 letters. The 8 Ionic letters were z , h , q , x , f , c , y , w , and the numerical value amounts to 2,684 , which is the perimeter of a rhombus whose sides are 671 , the number of the Hebrew name, Thora or Adonai, the bride, who corre - sponds to the feminine part of the Logos, and appropriately embodies all the feminine attributes of the number 2 . The name Ion, the founder of the Ionic race, having the value of 860 , further emp hasizes this connection between the Ionic cultus and the Cabalistic Spouse, for a vesica 496 (Malchuth) is 860 long. The numerical value of K...wn 'IwnikÒj is 2,040 + 2 = 2,042 , which is nearly the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. The proportion of the Ionic col umn was at first made 8 times its thickness, making its height 480 modules ( 60 × 8 = 480 ) and 480 is the width of a vesica 831 long. It was also made of the propor - tion of 8 1 / 2 to 1 , which gives it a height of 510 modules, which is about the side of a rh ombus whose perimeter is equal to the diameter of Saturn's orbit ( 510 × 4 = 2,040 ).

The account of the accident which suggested to Kallimachos the hint for composing a new capital is well known to every one. John Shute, an English architect of the sixteenth century, was evidently pleased with the story, and, as it stands in his book, it has more freshness and simplicity than the barer narrative of the Roman writer, so we shall repeat the legend in his works. “After that, in the citie of Corinthe was buried a certaine maiden, after whose burial her nourishe (who lamented much her death) knowing her delightes to have bene in prettye cuppes, and such like con - ceytes in her lifetime with many other thinges, appertayninge only to the pleasure of the eye, toke them and brok e them, and put them in a littell preatie baskette, and did sette the basket on her grave, and covered the basket with a square pavinge stone.

It c hanced, that the basket was set upon a certain roote of an herbe called acanthus, in frenche Brankursine, or Beare fote with us, now in the spring time of the yeare, when every roote spreadeth fourth his leaves in the increasing, they did ronne up by th e sides of the basket, until they could rise no higher for the stone that covered the basket, which, being square, and castinge his foure corners over the sydes of the rounde basket, constrained the branches of the herbe to draw downwardes againe with a cer - taine compasse, and so drew to the fashion that Vitruvius calleth Voluta. . . .

This story is generally supposed to be no more than an idle fancy, invented or repeated by Vitruvius. Nevertheless the circumstances related here are probably an indication of the ideas which the classical ar chitects associated with the third order of columns. Although this pillar is called Corin - thian, it might appropriately be called Æolic, and represent the third division of the Greek race, since the names Doric and Ionic were given to the preceding ord ers. Supposing that these three columns symbolize the three cabalistic powers, then the Corinthian order must be identical with the tenth step, and third person of the Trinity. Aiolos, 381 , appears in the “Odyssey” as the god of the winds, which seems to correspond with the pneuma, breath, or spirit of the Christian Trinity. The word Anemos, wind, has the value of 366 , or the number of days in the year, and 381 (Aiolos) is the length of a vesica 220 broad, or the diameter of the sun’s orbit. Thu s, by the circle of the year, by the winds, which the old cosmogra - phers placed round the world, by the sun’s orbit enclosed by the city of the bride, they associated the third column with the centre of the universe, and its flowering capital is a beau tiful emblem of the fertile earth. There was also a mystery in the Tomb of the Virgin that will be touched upon further on. The name Korinthios yields the number 539 , which is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 2,156 , the mean between the numb ers 2,151 and 2,160 — the first being the number of years in the great month, and the second the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. Kallimachos, the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY. 255 artificer, who is said to have first made a column of this form, has the numerical value of 1,002 , o r 1 / 1 2 of the length of the equinox when the sun’s course is measured on the earth’s circumference, and contained in an ark. The number 1,002 is also the diagonal of a square 709 , and the length of one of the strips of Plato’s cross, composed of the four elements. The proportions of this column are omitted by Vitruvius, but its height is generally about 10 times its thickness, and is therefore 600 parts ( 60 × 10 = 600 ). Now 600 is the numerical equivalent of the word cosmos. The two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, in the porch of Solomon’s temple, were supposed to exemplify the Hebrew proportions of columns. The position of these pillars decides their primary s ignificance. From Villalpanda’s plan, it will be seen that they flank the two chambers on either side of the porch and are intended to symbolize the double portion of the Triad, represented by the whole Temple. Their names, Strength and Stability, are analogous to the names of the two beings, Kratos, 691 (Strength), and Bia, 13 (Force), who appear in the play of Æschylus as the male and female powers, who bind or crucify Prometheus. They represent the twofold element of creation. Jachin in Hebrew has the value of 735 (IHKN) or counting the final “n” at 50 the number is 85 . Boaz, again, yields 79 (BOZ). Now 735 is the width of a vesica 1,275 long, and 1,275 is the height of a cross which crucifies a man in a square whose perimeter is 2,368 . And 85 1 / 4 is 1 / 1 2 of the radius of Saturn’s orbit, measured by the sun’s diameter. Then 79 , the value of Boaz, is the square root of 6,241 , which is the perimeter of a triangle whose sides are 2,080 . And 79 1 / 2 is the side of a rhombus"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 256 having a perimeter of 318 . Again, 735 + 79 = 814 , which is the circumference of a circle having a diameter of 259 , which is the numerical equivalent of Basileia, the Bride, or third person of the cabalistic triad. And 814 + 2 = 816 , which is the length of a vesica whose width is 471 , the diameter of a circle 1,480 in circumference. It is obvious that these two mystical columns are analogous to the pillars of Hermes and Seth, set up to record the astronomical science of their time. The height of each shaft was 18 cubits, its g irth 12 cubits, and the chapiter 5 cubits. They were cast in brass by HIRM (Hiram), or 255 , an ad - mirable number, for a square whose sides are 255 has a diagonal of 360 and a perimeter of 1,020 , the radius of Saturn’s orbit; and the measures which he cunningly ascribed to these canonical pillars are no less significant than this. Since their circumference is exactly specified, we find their diameter, reduced to inches, to be 68 3 / 4 , a number probably chosen because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 68 = 2,346 , or nearly 2,368 . Accordingly, if the shafts be laid side by side, they occupy an area of 324 by 137 1 / 2 inches, having a perimeter of 923 , or nearly the square root of the sun’s diameter in miles. Then, if the chapiters be added, the rectangle enclosing them becomes ( 324 + 900 =) 414 by 137 1 / 2 , and its perimeter is 1,103 or the height of a rood cross which will crucify a man in a square with a circuit equal to the diameter of Saturn's orbit. The rhombus which encloses the two pillars is 652 long, or nearly the diameter of a circle whose circumference is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. Again, the circumference of each shaft being 216 inches, we get the measure of the diameter of the sun’s orbit.

The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have become deaf . . . . and cannot comprehend them, just as you cannot look directly upon the sun, because your sight and sense are overcome by his beams. ” — C ICERO ’s “Vision of Scipi o.” T HE theory of ancient music seems to have been constructed from a study of the harmonic relations existing between the parts of the universe; and the musical canon, like that of architecture, was probably based upon certain symmetrical conson - ances, d iscovered in the proportions of the planets, and the intervals between their orbits. Yet none of the ancient rules of harmony, which are now intelligile, can be directly or simply traced to the known rations of the planetary orbits. But all the ancient explanations of the science of music are very obscure, and give the reader the impression that, as in the case of other arts, there is something behind their obvious statements which the writers did not choose to disclose. For instance, Vitruvius (bk. v., ch. 4 ), after stating that music is an abstruse science, difficult to understand, and requiring many Greek words in its explanation, says, “There are three sorts of modulation, the enharmonic ( ¡rmon...an ), the chro -"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"MUSIC OF THE SPHERES. 259 matic ( crîma ), and the diatonic ( di£ tonon ), so called by the Greeks.” From the numbers deduced from these Greek words, it may be reasonably assumed that they have been introduced into the text for mystical reasons; for we find Harmonia yields 272 , Chroma , 1,541 , and Diatonos , 705 ; and 272 is the width of a vesica 471 long, and 471 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 1,480 (a square whose sides are 471 has a diagonal of 666 ), and 272 is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 854 , which is the width of a ves ica 1,480 long. It may be therefore supposed that the word harmonia implies the number 1,480 . Then 1,540 is the length of a vesica 888 long, so that the word chroma may be taken to indicate the number 888 . Diatonos, again, has the value of 705 , which is in round numbers the side of a square whose diagonals are 999 ; and a vesica formed of two circles 999 in circumference has a perimeter of 666 , which may be supposed to be the number intended to be expressed by this name. We therefore get from the names given to the three kinds of harmony the numbers 2,046 , 1,480 , and 2,093 , as the supposed basis of the harmonic system, and they are, apparently, used here by Vitruvius, as the received canonical measures summarizing the principal dimensions of the universe. The three numbers, 2,368 , 1,480 , and 888 are in the ratio of 6 : 10 : 16 , being divisible by 148 . Now, if the sun's distance be taken at 10 , the order of the planets is very nearly in the following proportion: # 4 , $ 7 , ! 10 , % 16 , & 52 , ' 97 . There - fore the numbers 10 and 16 agree with the ratios of the sun and Mars, while the number 6 falls between Mercury and Venus; that is to say, 2,368 may represent the planet Mars, 1,480 the sun, and 888 the two inner planets Mercury and Venus."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 260 Thus the whole three are analogous to the cabalistic triad, according to the Pythagorean theory. For the first person was said to be male, the second person female, and the third person comprised the union of both. Pythagoras sometimes regarded the sun as the central fire of the universe, in which case it may have a feminine sense. These pro - portions probably formed the harmonic canon of the architects, and it may be concluded that they were known to Vitruvius. A theory of music is said to have been inven ted by Pythagoras, who said that numbers were the principles and elements of all things, and composed the harmonic proportions of the whole world. To him the rhythmic treatment of numbers was music, and he declared that “without numbers all measures, wei ghts, and art itself, would fall to the ground.” And music was the art of composing, and reconciling contrary and discordant things, according to the harmony of the world, called by the Greeks Ð kosmoj , 670 . It is also said that the system of Pythagoras was reduced to certain “har - monical canons, or rules found out by reason.” The assertion that the planets in their revolutions round the earth uttered certain sounds differing according to their respective “magnitude, celerity and local distance,” was co mmonly made by the Greeks. Thus Saturn, the farthest planet, was said to give the gravest note, while the moon, which is the nearest, gave the sharpest. “These sounds of the seven planets, and the sphere of the fixed stars, together with that above us, are the nine Muses, and their joint symphony is called Mnemosyne.” Pliny (bk. iii., ch. 22 ) says, “Saturn moveth by the Doric tone: Mercury by Pthongus, Jupiter by Phrygian and the rest likewise.” The Pythragorean harmony consisted of three concords, c alled Diapente, Diatessaron, and Diapason.

"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 262 discovery of these concords is said to have been made by Pythagoras, on hearing the hammers striking the anvil in a blacksmith’s shop. By an experiment he found that the variation of sound was produce d according to the weight of the hammer, and he demonstrated his theory thus. The weights of the hammers were respectively, 6 , 8 , 9 , and 12 pounds. He hung these weights upon strings of equal substance and length. When the two strings stretched by the greatest ( 12 ), and least ( 6 ) weight were struck, they sounded a diapa - son; the greatest and least but one a diapente, and the greatest, and next greatest sounded a diatessaron. “The diapente proportion was found by Pythagoras to be sesquialtera, the di atessaron sesquiterta, and the diapason or universal concord to be duple.” He made up the octochord by call - ing the sound produced from the string stretched by the 6 pound weight Hyate, that from the 8 pound weight Mese, that from the 9 Paramese, and that from the 12 pound weight Neate. Pythagoras, using the terms of music, called the interval between the earth and the moon a Tone. He supposed that the distance from the earth to the Zodiac measured seven of these tones, according to the following pr oportions. But Pliny, who gives us the information, calls this computation of the planetary intervals “a subtiltie more pleasant ywis than needful” 1 (bk. ii., ch. 22 ). By taking the Tone to be 296 , the greatest common measure of the three numbers, 2,36 8 , 1,480 , and 888 , the dis - tance would be 2,072 , or 1 more than 1 / 12 of the earth’s circumference in miles, and the inner line of the Holy Oblation. 1 “Jucunda magis, quam necessa ria subtilitate.”"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"MUSIC OF THE SPHERES. 263 Zodiac.

We are told by Serlio, who wrote in 1537 , that there were seven quadrangular proportions gener - ally used in architecture. “The first figure is a perfect square of four equal sides, and four right angles. The second figure is a sesquiquarta, that is, a square and a quarter ( 5 : 4 ). The third figure is a sesquitertia, that is, a square and a third (being of the proportion of 4 : 3 , it is the diatessaron). The fourth figure is of the proportion called diagonea, because its length is equal to the dia gonal of the square; it is irrational, there being no simple way of finding out this proportion from the frac - tional part of a square. The fifth figure is called sesquialtera, that is, a square and a half (it is of the proportion of 3 : 2 , or diapente). The sixth figure is called superbipartiens tertias, that is a square and two thirds added. The seventh and last figure is called dupla, and is formed of two squares joined together” (this is the proportion of 2 : 1 , or diapason). Serlio, like Vitruvi us, suggests no way of apply -"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 264 ing these proportions, but it may be, that by taking some number as the measure of the square, a series of proportions are derived, which when distributed throughout a building would give an harmonic result. Thus, if the side s of the square measured 592 , and its perimeter 2,368 , the six numbers pro - duced according to the above ratios would be 640 , 789 1 / 3 , 833 , 888 , 996 2 / 3 , and 1084 . Another series of harmonic proportions may be derived from the divisions of a circle, divided ac - cording to the figure given by Cesariano (Vitru - vius, p. 11 ). Nearly all the old philosophers devised an har - monic theory with respect to the universe, and the practice continued till the old mode of philo - sophizing died out. Kepler ( 1596 ), in order to demonstrate the Platonic doctrine, that the uni - verse was formed of the five regular solids, pro - posed the following rule. “The earth is a circle, the measurer of all. Round it describe a dodeca - hedron; the circle enclosing this will be Mars. Roun d Mars describe a tetrahedron; the sphere enclosing this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere containing this will be Saturn. Now inscribe in the earth an icosohedron; the circle inscribed in it will be Venus. Inscribe an octohed ron in Venus; the circle inscribed in it will be Mercury” (\"Mysterium Cosmographicum,” 1596 ). This rule cannot be taken seriously as a real statement of the proportions of the cosmos, for it bears no real resemblance to the ratios published by Copernicus in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Yet Kepler was very proud of his formula, and said he valued it more than the Electorate of Saxony. It was also approved by those two eminent authorities, Tycho and Galileo, who evi - dently understood it. Kepl er himself never gives"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"MUSIC OF THE SPHERES. 265 the least hint of how his precious rule is to be interpreted. The subjoined explanation is sub - mitted as a possible solution of its meaning. The earth, he says, is the mensor, or measurer of all, therefore everything depends upon the first step. The diameter of the earth is taken to be 660 , that is, 12 920 7 , ; and instead of taking the five figures as 12 solids, they are assumed to be so many regular plane polygons of 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 20 sides respect - ively. The c onstruction of the figure is conse - quently extremely easy. The twelve - sided figure enclosing the earth is contained by a circle 684 2 / 5 in diameter, whose circumference is 2,151 . This is the circle of Mars. The square described round Mars is enclosed by a circle with a radius of 488 , and a circumference of 3,067 ; this is the circle of Jupiter. The hexagon described round Jupiter is enclosed by a circle whose diameter is 1,120 ; and this is the circle of Saturn. The twenty - sided polygon inscribed wit hin the earth contains a circle with a diameter of 651 , and a circumference of 2,046 ; this is the circle of Venus. The octagon inscribed within Venus contains a circle whose diameter is 596 ; this is the circle of Mercury. It will be seen at once that the relative proportions of these circles have no agreement with the orbits of the planets whose names they bear; but every circle, either in its diameter or circumference, represents a cosmic measure. The circle of Mars has a circumference of 2,151 ; and ac cording to Plato’s distribution of the five solids in the “Timæus,” the dodecahedron represents the Zodiac; and 2,151 being the number of years in the great month, this may properly symbolize the Zodiacal circle. A hexagon described round this circle has a perimeter of 2,368 . The radius of the circle called Jupiter is 488 , the square root of the moon’s"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 266 distance from the earth in miles; the circumference of the same circle is the perimeter of the square which incloses the sun’s orbit measured by the to ne, and is inclosed by a rhombus inscribed within the Holy Oblation. The circle assigned to Saturn has a diameter of 1,120 , which is the height of a rood cross which crucifies a man contained in a square having a perimeter equal to the side of the Holy Oblation. The circumference of the circle of Venus is equal to the diameter of Saturn’s orbit, measured by the sun's diameter. The circle called Mercury has a diameter of 596 , which is the circumference of Saturn’s orbit if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 , and it may be taken for 592 , the side of a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . In Kepler's figure in the “Harmonices Mundi,” he allows three lines to each circle, which seems to imply that a certain latitude is to be allowed in the geometry. Probab ly, therefore, this mystical diagram sym - bolically reveals the astronomical measures secretly applied to theology, and seems to be intended to illustrate the harmony which was supposed to exist between the sun, the fixed stars, and the inter - vening planet s, likened, by Kepler, to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It seems to ex - emplify Kepler’s attitude to all astronomical prob - lems, and to be a result of the old searching after symmetry and harmony in the order of the heavens. For the three law s formulated by him could only have been discovered by a mind intent upon finding harmonic relations of this kind. And he evidently devoted his life to this search. It was music and philosophy which really interested Kepler, rather than the patient and c areful observation of nature which occupied his friend Tycho. And although he used Tycho’s observations he never seriously pursued any of these natural inquiries as an end,"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"MUSIC OF THE SPHERES. 267 but rather, like the ancients, he tried to use them as a means to artistic expr ession. He stands as one of the last astronomers of the old type, and gives us a valuable insight into the practice of the earlier school, who combined astronomy with the doctrines of philosophy. Another ingenious contrivance of the old philo - sophers wa s the magic square. The curious re - sults produced from the combination of numbers in these squares would naturally appeal to the mind, when first discovered, as presenting an analogy to that harmony and symmetry which they dis - covered, or sought to disc over, in all creation. The admiration for these numerical wonders was probably genuine among the philosophers, but the magical properties attributed to them by the priests could only have been believed in by an ignorant and superstitious populace. Corne lius Agrippa describes seven of these squares. “It is affirmed,” he says, \"by magicians, that there are certain sacred tables of the planets endowed with many and very great virtues of the heavens, inasmuch as they represent that divine order of celestia l numbers which can no other way be expressed than by the marks of numbers and characters. The first of them is assigned to Saturn, and consists of a square of three, containing the particular numbers of nine, and in every line, three every way and throu gh each diameter (diagonal), making fifteen. Now the whole sum of the numbers is forty - five. Each number represents an intelligency for good, or a spirit for bad. Out of the same numbers is drawn the seal, or character, which should be engraved on a plate of lead. If this be done with a fortunate Saturn it is a safeguard to births and bringing forth, but if it be done with an unfortunate Saturn, it hinders buildings, plantings, and the like, and casts a man from honours and dignities.”"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 268 The number 45 , deduced from this square, is in round numbers the square root of Saturn’s orbit. And if the numbers of the square be read from right to left in the three rows, we get 294 , 753 , and 618 , all of which are mystical numbers, already discussed. 294 is t he numerical equivalent for Ecclesia, the Church, 753 is the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2,368 , and 618 is the numerical equivalent of IHS , etc. By reading it perpendicularly other numbers are obtained, which have also mystical meanings. T he number of circles in the universe, counting from the earth to the empyreum is 15 . 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 “The second is called the table of Jupiter, which consists of a quaternion drawn into itself, contain - ing 16 particular numbers, and in every line a nd diameter 4 , making 34 .

This being engraven on a golden plate, ren ders him who wears it re - nowned and amiable, and equals a man to kings and princes. . . . but with an unfortunate sun it makes a tyrant.” The numbers of this square are all curiously appropriate to the sun, whose ark has been shown to measure 666 of its diameters. Again, 666 is the diameter of a circle 2,093 in circumference, and 2,093 is 9 1 / 2 times the diameter of the sun’s orbit as well as the diameter of the circle containing the square whose sides are 1,480 — the measure of the body of Christos. “Th e fifth table is of Venus, consisting of a square of 7 drawn into itself, namely, of 49 numbers, whereof 7 on each side and diameter make 175 , and the sum of all is 1,225 . This being engraven on a silver plate, Venus being fortunate procureth concord an d love, and endeth strife, . . . and con - duceth to the cure of all melancholy distempers. . . . But if it be formed upon brass with an un - fortunate Venus, it produceth the contrary.” In round numbers 49 is the square root of 2,368 . And 1,225 is the measure of a cross whose limbs are 612 1 / 2 long. “The sixth table is of Mercury, resulting from"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 270 the square of 8 drawn into itself, containing 64 numbers, whereof 8 on every side and by both diameters make 260 , and the sum of all, 2,080 . . . .

The number 2,080 , thus associated with Hermes, connects this god with the Holy Oblation and confirms the opinion of the Gnostics, that he was identical with Christos. The number 64 is the numerical equivalent of the word Aletheia, Truth. And 260 is, besides being 10 times 26 , the diameter of a circle whose area is equal to that of a square whose sides are 231 . “The seventh table is of the moon, of a square of 9 multiplied into itself, having 81 numbers, in every side and diameter 9 , producing 369 , and the sum of all is 3,321 . . . This fortunate moon being engraven on silver renders the bearer amiable, pleasant, honoured, and without malice. But if it be an unfortunate moon, engraven on a plate of lead, wherever it shall be buried it makes that place unfortunate.” The moon was the accepted symbol of the sub - lunary world, containing the four elements, and the four elements were att ributed to the body of the Logos. Now, 81 × 9 1 / 2 = 769 , and 769 is the length of the transverse beam of a cross whose extreme measure is 2,368 . Again, 369 is 1 less than 370 , the side of a square whose perimeter is 1,480 (“Occult Philosophy,” bk. ii., ch. 22 ).

The inscriptions on these mysterious gems are very often unreadable, and bear upon them unknown names and words without meaning. It is pr obable, therefore, that they were intended to be read as numbers, and thus conveyed a mean - ing appropriate to the symbolical devices which they accompanied.

B EFORE entering upon the details of the ancient mystic rites, perhaps a word ought to be said on the virtue of modesty. Tertullian , justly admired for the enthusiastic eloquence of his writings, calls “modesty the flower of manners, the honour of our bodies, the grace of the sexes, the integrity of the blood, the guarantee of our race, the basis of sanctity, the pre - indication of ev ery good disposition.” We can hardly doubt the sincerity of the man who bestows such praise upon this virtue, or refuse to regard him as a modest man. Yet neither can we suppose that our British matron in these days would sanction Tertullian’s treatises “On Baptism,” “The Soul,” “The Ascetic’s Mantle,” or “The Strain of Jonah,” were the good lady capable of understanding them. It is not that he fails to cover religiously every naked thought with the symbolical cloak of shame, exactly as she would demand , but there is that in his argument which would inevitably revolt a nine - teenth century champion of modesty. For now we demand a theme which can be uttered simply,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 276 and without all the elaborate toilet of a shameful thing. And herein lies one of the di fferences be - tween the feeling of the ancients and our own. Brought up as we all are in the nineteenth cen - tury, it seems at first sight shocking that they should have argued by analogies which appear so impossible to our minds. Not that they had no sen se of decorum, but there is something in their attitude of mind towards certain matters which divides them from us. It is almost incredible that, underlying the beautiful legend of Cupid and Psyche as told by Apuleius, or the marvellous parable of the cr ucified Christ, there should be a hidden meaning of which it is impossible to speak. All this leads us to search into the root and origin of that shame, which all mankind possess, but in different degrees. It must have been a feeling akin to our own, which caused the primitive theologists to hide from view the spirit of their dogma, and to establish an inviolable secrecy around their mysteries. For they made it some - times shameful even to utter the name of God. From this, doubtless, a purely supe rstitious feeling of modesty arose, but it seems that shame is a spontaneous impulse peculiar to man, for the beasts have none of it; and it is more than an artificial sense fostered originally by priests and taught by women to their children. In fact, it is a higher faculty developed by the increased sensi - tiveness of men over the brute animals. And it arises plainly from natural reasons, which it would be immodest to mention. Of this shame the Greeks seem to have had the least of all civilized peo ples. And they were at once the most refined, cultivated, and accomplished race who have ever lived in this world. We learn from Plutarch, that Lycurgus ordered the Spartan"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 277 virgins “to go naked, as well as the young men,” dance and sing in their presence , at certain solemn feasts and sacrifices.” And though it may appear strange,” he says, \"that virgins should appear thus naked in public, yet, as the strictest modesty was preserved, there was nothing of indecency in it; but it accustomed them to an inn ocent simplicity.” At Sparta this practice formed a part of the noble cultivation of the body, which gave that people their great physical strength and beauty. We see that, although Plutarch here speaks of modesty, it is something rather different from ours. Again, the religious rite described by Aris - tophanes, in the “Acharnians” (v. 241 ), sounds strange in nineteenth century cars: “Use no ill - omened words. Let the basket - bearer advance a little forward. Let Xanthias set up the phallus erect.” But to the Greek, who walked naked in the sun, this was a most natural, and in no sense an immodest proceeding. The same absence of shame existed in Rome, where unabashed virgins and matrons were accustomed to hang garlands on the effigy of Priapus, 1 standing in the midst of his garden. For the good Priapus, with his homely bucolic grin, was regarded by the old Roman with a peculiar veneration, which was a mixture of affection and buffoonery, not always or necessarily the expression of indecency or unseemlin ess, but rather the remnant of the crude but chaste impulse, which moved the simple rural population to gather in worship round the undisguised Phallus, as the emblem of the generative powers of Nature. It was ever the function of ancient art to ingenious ly cover the naked truth, and to veil the primitive nudity with other and perhaps seemlier 1 See St. Augustine, “City of God,” bk. vii., ch. xxi. - xxiv."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 278 forms. And so it was that naked Hermes gra - dually disappeared from the market place, and crude old Priapus was decked with no more gar - lands in ladies’ gardens. Then the Cross, the old symbol of Egypt was brought forth from the secrecy of mysterious orgies, and was displayed more and more openly. It not only replaced the old Hermes at cross - roads, and in the middle of the town, but was conspicuously seen as t he central object in every new temple. The cross was chosen as a fitting emblem to express the same funda - mental principle of creation which had been de - noted by the earlier figures. Consequently, in the Middle Ages, when the glorification of the Cr oss reached its height, we find the pious monk kneeling in adoration of the Logos, or devoutly kissing his crucifix in simple faith and knowledge, but without shame. Thus it is plain that, while all the ancients knew and experienced a certain feeling of m odesty, the sense of it to which our forefathers, the Puri - tans, first gave expression, is a peculiarly modern feeling. The Puritans were very obviously absurd people, and the reformation with which they were connected, was an ignorant movement from the beginning, notwithstanding the fact that it may have been a tendency towards better things. Yet those Puritans, whom it is so easy to ridicule, have so far influenced the generations immediately preceding our own, that it has become difficult to decide whether ours is a worthier feeling of modesty than that of our ancestors. In their revolt against the old pagan doctrines of the church, as something indecent and repulsive, they rose up and destroyed the old images and ecclesiastical symbols, to such pu rpose, that we believe there does not exist in England a rood cross, dating from a time previous to the Reformation. This idol seems to have been"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 279 especially shameful in their eyes. The Scottish covenanters were horrified at the very sight of a cross — thei r feelings being like those of old Philip Stubbes towards the May - pole, when he called it a “Stinkying idoll.” The only thing we do not understand is, how, when they rejected the Cross they retained the Christ, for the two are so in - separably connected to a modern mind, that the aversion to the one would naturally apply to the other. The ritual of all the pagan cults has been so effectually destroyed by their successors, that there does not exist a single vestige of the ceremonial rites with which the Gre eks and Romans invoked their deities. All the offices and ritual appertain - ing to the worship of the virgin Athene in the Parthenon, or Apollo at Delphi, are now lost and forgotten. A few hymns addressed to the old gods have come down to us, but there is not a trace of the ceremonial order observed in the ordinary temple services of the pagan cults, and there remain only a few references to the sacred rites enacted in the celebration of the initiatory mysteries at Eleusis and elsewhere. 1 We possess, 1 Of the religious mysteries of Pagan Rome very little is now known. St. Augustine (“De Civitate Dei,” lib. vii. cap. 34 ) tells us, on the authority of Varro, that some books were dis - covered by a man who was ploughing the land near the grave of Numa. These books contained the secret knowledge under - lying the theology instituted by Numa, and that, according to St. Augus tine, was too infamous even to be retained as the mystery of the priesthood, from which it would appear that it was very bad indeed. Numa, it was said, feared to publish the books on account of their singular content; nor did he dare to burn them, for fear of devils; so as a compromise he buried them in the earth. The senate ultimately obtained possession of them; but although they thus discovered the shameful nature of their ancestral religion, they were afraid to overturn it.

The Liturgy of the Christians introduced so many of the rites previously establishe d as a part of the Greek mysteries, that the correspondence between the two must be acknowledged by every one acquainted with the ceremonies of both systems. The two great Sacraments of the Chris - tian church were mystical rites, having a hidden or es oteric meaning, secretly performed after an elaborate and exacting preparation. The mys - terious nature of the faith is distinctly set forth by Origen, as follows: “Since he [Celsus] frequently calls the Christian doctrine a secret system, we must confut e him on this point also, since almost the entire world is better acquainted with what Christians preach than with the favourite opinions of philosophers. For who is ignorant of the state - ment that Jesus was born of a virgin, and that He was crucified, and that His resurrection is an article of faith among many, and that a general judgment is announced to come, in which the wicked are to be punished according to their mysteries might be lost for ever, they ordered the books to be burnt. Lactantius gives another account of the finding of Numa’s books (“Divine Institutes,” bk. i. chap. 22 ). He says that Numa was the first to establish pontiffs , priests, salii, and augurs among the Romans. “But though he deceived others he did not deceive himself. For after many years, in the consulship of Cornelius and Bebius, in a field belonging to the Scribe Petilius, under the Janiculum, two stone ches ts were found by men who were digging, in one of which was the body of Numa, in the other seven books in Latin, respecting the law of the pontiffs, and the same number written in Greek respect - ing systems of philosophy, in which he not only annulled th e religious rites which he himself had instituted, but all others also.”"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 281 deserts, and the righteous to be duly rewarded? And yet the mystery of the resurre ction, not being understood , is made a subject of ridicule among unbelievers. In these circumstances, to speak of the Christian doctrine as a secret system, is alto - gether absurd. But that there should be certain doctrines not made known to the multitud e, which are [revealed] after the esoteric ones have been taught, is not a peculiarity of Christianity alone, but also of philosophic systems, in which certain truths are esoteric and others esoteric. Some of the hearers of Pythagoras were content with his ipse dixit ; while others were taught in secret those doctrines which were not deemed fit to be communicated to profane and insufficiently pre - pared ears. Moreover, all the mysteries that are celebrated everywhere throughout Greece and barbarian coun tries, although held in secret have no discredit thrown upon them, so that it is vain that he endeavours to calumniate the secret doc - trines of Christianity, seeing he does not correctly understand its nature.” (“Against Celsus,” bk. i., ch. 7 .) Orige n, in the above quotation, complains that the misconceptions concerning the Christian faith arose from the mystery of the resurrection not being properly understood. It is therefore neces - sary to make sure that the meaning of the great events of Christ’ s life are known to us before inquiring into those rites which merely com - memorated or typically represented them. The resurrection, the immediate consequence of the crucifixion, offered by analogy the joyful prospect of a future life according to the reve lation of the mysteries. For the crucifixion of Christ, like the “unspeakable mystery of the Eleusinian rites,” 1 was the great cosmic love - scene, hyper - 1 See Hippolytus, quoted below, on p. 60 ."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 282 bolically portrayed as a symbol of the conjunction or marriage of the heaven and the earth; it exhi bited the natural powers of the universe in the act of begetting, and afforded a sight of God and Nature to the very pangs and embracements of love. It presented to the eye an image of the actual germination, which recurs in regular order every spring. The vernal equinox had been the occasion when the impregnation of the world was annually cele - brated for centuries before the Christians began to commemorate the Crucifixion on Good Friday and the Resurrection on Easter Day. To the old Pagans this stupe ndous consummation had been the humanizing of the natural powers of omni - potence, infinity, and eternity, which could only be conceived by some concrete figure, and it brought home to them by analogy the love of God for the earth and the hope of life t hrough death. To the Christian a similar vision was set forth in the Passion of Christ described in the Gospel. For when the light of the sun was quenched, amidst thunder and lightning and other strange portents, we must imagine the earth quivering a nd shaking at the awful moment when the spirit of God descended upon her. All this was simply man, the microcosm, arguing from the lesser to the greater, and attributing to the unknown powers above and beyond him, a grander and more sublime version of h is own miniature powers of creation. The experienced knew something of this, and bowed down without superstition or delusion before the symbol of a mighty transaction, too great and deep for their comprehension.

In the case of the Greeks, Hebrews, and Chris tians, the great feast of the year was a commemoration of this fact, and in each case was celebrated at the vernal equinox. The pious Greeks were quite as careful to guard the secrets of paganism as the Christians were with respect to the doctrines of the Church; our knowledge of the Eleusinian and other mysteries is chiefly con - fined to the accounts of the Fathers, who, being the supporters of a rival system, give us a very perverted and inadequate description of them. 1 In his “Exhortation to the Hea then” St. Clement, who had been initiated, has made some instructive allusions to the old mystic feasts, which may be profitably studied. 2 But notwithstanding the lack of precise information as to the details of the ancient mysteries, we know that the rites of 1 All the rival religious sects, ancient and modern have accused each other of worshipping false gods. The Sibyl, whose gods were no bett er than those of other people, thus reproves the Greeks: “Why trustest thou, O Greece, to princely men? Why to the dead dost offer empty gifts? Thou offerest to idols; this error who suggested, That thou shouldst leave the presence of the mighty God, And m ake these offering?” L ACTANTIUS , “Divine Institutes,” bk. i., ch. xv. The Christian fathers administered similar rebukes to those who upheld the theology of the Sibylline books, and the Reformers hurled even more violent reproaches at their fellow - Chri stians, who continuted to maintain the practices of the early church. These sectarian squabbles are both unseemly and absurd in themselves, but their value to outsiders is enormous, for whenever people quarrel they become indiscreet, and the result is that we learn more of the hidden doctrines of the priests from these fooolish theological disputes than from any other source. 2 Among modern writers, the “Great Dionysiak Myth,” by Mr. Robert Brown, jun., will also be found instructive on this subject."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 284 baptism and the Eucharist were perpetuated by the Christians from similar ordinances forming a part of the pagan ritual, and the parallel between the dramatic shows representing the life of Orpheus or Dionysus enacted in Greece and the symbolical scene of the Mass is complete. In both cases the acts of the drama unfolded the meaning of the theological mystery by means of imitative cere - monies, and the initiations were so arranged that the ignorant neophytes were gradually instructed in the hi dden truths, which were concealed under the characters and events of the mythos. Although it is unknown how the pagan neophyte was prepared and instructed, so as to be able to understand the ceremonial acts which he was finally to witness, there are exta nt a set of lectures delivered by St. Cyril of Jerusalem, which furnish us with an outline of the teaching accorded to the Christian before he was allowed to participate in the Rites and Mysteries of his religion. Unless those lectures were accompanied , as doubtless they were, with further oral instructions, there does not seem to have been much necessity for keeping them secret. Nevertheless, the following address to the reader is found at the beginning of the book. “These catechetical lectures thou mayest put into the hands of Candidates for Baptism and Baptized believers, but by no means of Catechumens, nor of any others, who are not Christians; as thou shalt answer to the Lord. And if thou take a copy of them, write this in the beginning, as in the sight of the Lord.” The lectures were delivered with closed doors, in the evening during Lent. The candidates were baptized on Easter eve, and afterwards partook of the Eucharistic feast. The final instruction is contained in the last four lectures , delivered to the baptized in Easter week. St. Silvia (“Pilgrimage"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 285 to the Holy Places,” p. 76 , Palestine Pilgrim Text Soc.) has vividly portrayed the scene of a Christian initiation in her time. She says, “The doors are shut lest any catechumen should find his way in. And while the bishop is arguing about and ex - pounding the details, so loud are the voices of those applauding, that they are heard outside the church. For truly all the mysteries are made so plain that there is no one but is moved by t he things that he hears thus expounded.” The follow - ing passage from the Sixth Lecture of St. Cyril is an instance of how they were addressed: “To hear the Gospel is allowed to all: but the glory of the Gospel is set apart for them that are truly Christ ’s. Therefore our Lord spake in parables to them who were not able to hear; but to his disciples he expounded them privately: for the brightness of Glory is for the Illuminated, but blindness for the unbelievers. These mysteries which the Church now spe aks to thee who art removed from the catechumens, it is not the custom to speak to the Gentiles: for to a Gentile we speak not the mysteries concerning the Father, and Son, and the Holy Spirit, nor before catechumens do we dis - course plainly about mysteri es; but many things many times we speak in a covert manner, that the faithful who know may understand, and that those who know not may receive no hurt.” (Lect. vi., 29 .) In the early Church, infant baptism was unknown; the ceremony being consciously underg one by those who had come to years of discretion as a symbolical rite, which raised them from ignorance to a knowledge and participation in the deeper mysteries of the Church, and its elaborate ritual was only second in importance to that of the Mass, and was properly the prelude to the Euchar - istic feast. It seems, however, to have been performed as a complete ordinance, having much"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 286 the same significance as the higher mystery. In primitive times it consisted in the immersion of the body into the sea , a river, or fountain, but in St. Cyril’s time it was the custom among the Christians to anoint the baptized person with chrism or oil before entering the water. St. Cyril says, “when ye were stripped ye were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet. . . . After those things ye were led to the holy pool of Divine baptism, as Christ was carried from the cross to the Sepulchre. . . . And descended three times into the water, and ascended again” (Lect. xx.). He furth er says that the three immersions refer to the three days passed by Christ in the “womb of the Earth,” for “at the self - same moment ye died and were born; and that water of salvation was at once your grave and your mother.” Besides its other mysteries t he Baptismal ritual exhibits a cosmic significance in the names and words used in the performance of the rite. The word Baptismos (baptism) has the value of 903 , which is 1 more than the side of a square having a diagonal of 1,275 , the height of a cross which will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 ; and a rhombus 902.77 long has a peri - meter of 2,083 1 / 3 , the length of the side of the Holy Oblation. Sometimes the neophyte was anointed twice, first with oil ( 'ELAION , 166 ), and after wards with chrism ( MURON , 660 ). The esoteric meaning of this double unction is obvious, but it is remarkable that the two words may symbolize by their numbers the Sun and the Earth, for 166 1 / 2 is the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of 666 , and 660 is 1 / 1 2 of the Earth’s diameter in miles. And 660 + 166 = 826 , which is the diagonal of a square whose area is equal to a circle 660 in diameter. Again,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 287 826 is the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 3,307 , which is the height of a cross having a tran sverse beam 1,075 long; it will, therefore, crucify the figure of the Logos, whose body measures ( 1,075 × 2 =) 2,150 . The circle surrounding the figure has a circumference of 3,378 , or the number of miles in the diameter of the moon’s orbit divided by 12 twice. The Baptistry of the early Basilicas (as at Tor - cello) was built at the west end of the church, occupying a position corresponding to that of the Holy Sepulchre in the church at Jerusalem. It was generally a detached structure, and supposing the whole church to be an emblem of the ten steps comprised in the cabalistic diagram, the Baptistry appropr iately typifies the tenth step, which was a personification of the great mother Earth, or the heavenly spouse of the Logos, called the Holy Ghost. The Eucharist, as the supreme mystery of the church, was the last ceremony of initiation, and constituted th e final enlightenment of the Christian neophyte. In the early Church it was a secret orgy, celebrated at night, like the Greek mysteries. No unbelievers, Gentiles, or Catechumens, were admitted. As everybody knows, it was analogous to the Jewish feast of the Passover, and com - memorated the Paschal Supper, partaken of by Christ and his disciples on the eve of his betrayal. On the 14 th day of the month of Nisan (March), the Hebrews killed a lamb, which was roasted and eaten by each family with certain o bservances. among which were the eating of unleavened cakes and the drinking of four cups of wine. According to Lightfoot the Jews called the third of these cups the “cup of blessing,” and he says that it was this cup which Jesus blessed at his last Pas sover. The novelty, therefore, of the Christian rite chiefly"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 288 lay in their dispensing with the slaughter of the lamb, a ceremony which had doubtless become obsolete when the sun passed from the sign of the Ram. Both Jews and Christians were alike in symb olically commemorating the act of salvation by the death of a victim, the only difference being that the Christians, in the bloodless sacrifice, assumed that the death of Christos was mystically enacted at every celebration of the Mass, when the faithful , according to St. Cyril, tasted the body and drank the blood of their Saviour. “Judge not the matter by taste,” he says, “but from faith be fully assured without misgiving, that thou hast been vouchsafed the Body and Blood of Christ.” While the cerem onies of the Pagan mysteries and the Jewish Paschal feast account for the institu - tion of the Christian Eucharist, its more immediate prototype was the Last Supper of Christ and his disciples described in the Gospel. The language and words used on this occasion were considered of so great importance that they were incorporated, word for word, into the liturgy of the Mass, and were understood to convey the true meaning and purpose of this mystic feast. That these words should have been chosen with the utmost care by the compilers of the Gospel may be taken for granted, and if there is any truth in what has been said about the numerical value of names, it is to be expected that here, if anywhere, the application of that system would be clearly manifes t. In St. Mark's Gospel (xiv. 22 ) the description of the supper is given thus: “And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them; and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"RITUAL. 289 blood of the [new] testament, which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the king dom of God.” In the first place it is said that he took bread, the element which signified his body. In the original the word 'ARTOS (bread) has the value of 671 , 1 and is, therefore, by the Gematria equivalent to Thora and Adonai, the names of the thir d person of the Cabalistic Triad, here synonymous with the Holy Ghost, the spouse, or feminine aspect of the Logos. And the word SWMA (body) yields the number 1,041 , or the radius of the sphere of the Zodiac contained within the Holy Oblation ( 1,041 1 / 2 × 2 = 2,083 ). This measure may be taken as an emblem of the vital essence, or spirit of life, surrounding the whole material universe, and exhibits the bride by a figure, analogous to the Greek Aphrodite Ourania. Next, it is said, “He took the cup,” wh ich figuratively stands also for the wine which was in it. The Greek word used here for cup is POTHRION , and it is numerically equal to 688 , which is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 2,162 , the number of miles in the moon’s diameter. By this it may be supposed that the sublunary world is intended, from the four elements of which the body of the Logos was compounded, in the shape of a cross, the masculine emblem. Then `AIMA 1 The fact that ¥rtoj yields 671 may explain the sarcastic remark of the puritanical Gale, that “The great sacrifice which the sons of Antichrist so much adore is that of their Masse, or Hostie, as they call it, wherein they sacrifice and eat their Brea den God, in commemoration, as they fancie, of Christ’s sacrifice on the crosse . . . which is a piece of idolatrie so monstrous that Averroes himself abhorred it, crying out that he had rather his soul should be with the philosophers than with such as did eat their God” (“Court of the Gentiles,” vol. iii, p. 200 )."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 290 (blood) yields 52 , the square root of 2,704 , the perimeter o f a rhombus whose sides are 676 .

Now 192.9 × 9. 5 = 1,832.5 . By the Bread and the Cup, therefore, we see the symbols of the masculine and feminine powers of the universe commingled together. And thus the Christian philosophers, like their predecessors, typically celebrated the marriage of the cosmic powers, which every spring revivify the earth, causing her to bring forth her yearly fruits.

Another method of marking the oblation was with 2 Chis crossing one another, The letter, Chi , having the value of 600 , the two together yield 1,200 , and a vesica 1,200 broad, is 2,080 long, or the side of the Holy Oblation, therefore this device upon the offering may be said to signify the figure of Christos, extended crosswise throughout the whole universe. The offering or oblation was also called Anaphora , which is a combination of the two words, ¢n£ , 52 , and for£ , 671 . The conjunction of the two numbers is presumably intentional. In Hebrew the word Ben (son) yields 52 , which is moreover the square root of 2,704 , the perimeter of the rhombus whose sides are 676 . The Seventy appl y the word 'APARCH , 790 , to the Holy Oblation, and 789 1 / 3 , is the width of a vesica formed by two intersecting circles, whose united width is 2,368 , which appropriately identi - fied the offering, or victim, with the Messiah, Jesus Christ, whose body was m ystically encom - passed by the figure of Ezekiel. The word Anaphora, again, has the value of 723 , which is a fraction more than the length of a rhombus whose sides are 416 2 / 3 . Now the city in the centre of the Holy Oblation has been shown to measure 416 2 / 3 on each of its sides, so this rhombus may be taken as a secret emblem of the same figure.

The Chasuble signified the seamless garment, or purple robe.

By taking three steps back from the altar, and humbling himself before beginning the mass, the celebrant expressed the prostration of Christ in the Garden. “Ascending to the altar, the priest kisseth the middle of it, because the altar signifies the Church.” “The Gospel was read at the north end of the altar to signify that Satan’s Kingdom (seated in the north, Lev. I. 14 ) is destroyed.” The offerings were signed five times to signify Christ’s five wounds, and the Host and Chali ce were signed three times, to denote the three hours which Christ hung on the Cross. The uncovering of the chalice, and signing it three times with the Host, indicate the rending the veil of the Temple. The laying down of the Host upon the corporal, and then covering the chalice again, signified the descent from the Cross, and the silence which followed denoted Christ’s period in the grave. The Host, divided into three parts, signified the dividing of the Body into hands, side, and feet. The particle of the Host, put into the chalice, symbolized the “re - uniting of our Saviours Body and Soul” (W. Turner, “Hist. of all Religions,” 1625 , pp. 263 - 264 ). The ceremonial acts just enumerated follow Jupiter.

In the Church of Rome the mass was called missa , for no very obvious reason, but if the letters of the word are computed, according to the Hebrew valuations, its numerical value is 651 , or the diameter of the circle having a circumference equal to the diameter of Saturn's orbit; being equivalent by Gematria to Teletai , mystic rites, and to Episteme , science, it may fitly represent the nature of the knowledge communicated to the i nitiate who was allowed to partake of the feast with an instructed and enlightened mind. The baptismal rite, as already pointed out, was performed in a chamber at the west end of the church, but the Eucharist was offered at the altar to the east, within the bema or sanctuary. By referring to the plan of the Basilica of Torcello, it will be seen that the church, according to the practice of the time, has a threefold termination, and supposing the church to represent the cabal - istic diagram, this triple arrangement would cor - respond to the three upper steps. The east end of the Gothic churches was built in the form of a tau cross, the western half of the church being of a long rectangular shape, resem - bling Noah’s Ark, which is probably connected with the name, ship, or nave, given to this part of the building. Therefore the east end of the church exhibits the symbol of the Macrocosm or Father, who is the antithesis of the Bride, allocated to the west. While the choir or CHOROS , 1,040 , between the two, figuratively contained the seven circles of the planets, with the body of Christ in the midst of them.

In the working of a masonic degree the sym - bolical lodge is not the room in which the cere - mony is performed, but the emblematic design which is painted upon a movable board and laid upon the floor. As the initiate advances the lodge changes its character, and in every degree he finds a new board before him, the symbolic devices upon it being appropriate to each step in the ritual. The particular specimen before us is not more than a hundred years old, but it was probably designed according to a traditional plan handed down from remote times. On one side it shows a lodge of the first and second degrees, and on the other, that of the third degree. The proportion of the Board is very nearly in the ratio of 3 : 1 , that is to say, it is composed of three squares laid in a row, and is consequently of the same propor - tion as the floor of the tabernacle. The events enacted in the Masonic ritual are, of course, supposed to take place at t he building of Solomon’s Temple, and m the first degree the apprentice enters into the porch, which is symbol - ized on the lodge board by the two Pillars with a doorway between them. It has been said that the Temple of Solomon is figuratively set forth in every church, and if, as we have supposed, the Temple followed the pattern of the Cabalistic diagram, then the apprentice, being brought into the porch, which has been identified with the tenth step, must symbolically ascend from the earth to the highe st heaven. At first the candidate only sees half of the board, for he is admitted no farther than the porch or sublunary world.

It has already been shown that the six steps, intermediate between the tenth and the third, were referred by cabalists to the Logos, or the second person of the triad. Accordingly the fellow craft sees in these emblems on the floor a figure of the Microco sm whose body occupies the region between the moon and the zodiac. The choir in the middle of a church corresponds to the tracing board of a fellow craft’s lodge. For the third degree the tracing board is turned over, and the candidate is confronted wit h the half open coffin. He has passed through the elements as an embryo, traversed the planetary orbits as a man, and now having left the material world behind, he enters the empyreum or three hypo - thetical circles which surround the zodiac. The Holy of Holies of the Temple was supposed to symbolize this region, corresponding to the three upper steps of the Cabala under the name of the Macrocosm or Father. So the initiate now personates Father Hiram, the master builder of Solomon, whose spirit in de ath ascends to the spheres of Heaven, which the ancients supposed to be the dwelling place of souls. Thus the masonic ritual epitomizes, in its three stages, the whole compass of existence, both cosmic and human. The apprentice personates the man in h is embryonic or antenatal period, the fellow craft represents him in the flesh, while the master’s death allegorically signifies the transmission of the soul to the starry fluid of the empyreum, from which it re - issues into a new sphere of life, in anot her incarnation.

The emblematic order of the tracing board may be compared with the disposition o f a Christian church, described by that truly instructed mason, Dr. Oliver (“Discrepancies,” p. 103 ).

Then the triad, composed of the transepts and sanctuary, amounts to ( 93 + 800 + 911 =) 1,804 or 1 less than the side of a triangle inscribed within the Holy Oblation. Secondly, to the middle point, at the crossing of the transepts and n ave, is assigned the number 325 , and the cross, whose limbs are 325 1 / 2 , measures 651 . If we add to this 64 , we get 389 , or 1 less than the number of polis, a city, and the side of a rhombus 676 feet long. These two middle names, applied to the church “ Militant,” represent the stauros and omphalos in the centre of the world. Thirdly, the number of the porch is 166 , or 1 more than the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is 660 , the diameter of the earth. Lastly, the sum of the six numbers is 2,359 + 6 = 2,365 , which is apparently intended for 2,368 , Jesus Christ. A further connection between the three degrees, and the “Church Expectant, the Church Militant, and the Church Triumphant” is noticed by Oliver. A mason's lodge is theoretically supported b y three pillars, called in Hebrew, DBR (wisdom), OZ (strength), and GMR (beauty). The numerical value of the three names is 426 [ sic. , s.b. 526 — T.S.] the side of a square inclosed by a rhombus whose sides are 671 .

Geometrically, the measures of the tracing - board fully bear out the statements in the ritual, that the lodge is as long as the east is from the west, and as broad as the north is from the south, and as high as the heavens. It measures extern - ally about 64 × 21 1 / 4 inches, and seems to have been ingeniously contrived to include all the canonical numbers of the universe.

Again, the perimeter of the inner line of the denticulated border is 155.79 , and 155.79 × 9.5 = 1,480 . Thus indirectly the numbers 2,368 , 2,046 , and 1,480 are obtai ned in a very simple way. Further, the number 64 implies the measure of the Holy Oblation, for the sum of the numbers from 1 to 64 = 2,080 . Also 64 inches are equal to 192 barleycorns, and 192 is the numerical equivalent of the name Mariam . The area of the space inclosed by the border is ( 60 × 18 =) 1,080 inches, or the number of miles in the moon’s radius, and the numerical equivalent of To Pneuma Hagion , the Holy Ghost. The rhombus which contains the board has a perimeter of 231 inches, which is also the circuit of the lid of the pyramid - c offin. The hexagon which surrounds the board has a perimeter of 691 , or the length of the sun’s orbit. If the board be inclosed by a Solomon’s Seal, the measure of the interlacing triangles from point to point is 384 barleycorns, or the amount of the sun ’s distance measured by the tone.

It is impossible to discuss the Masonic legend here, since the masons, unlike the Christian priests, still perform their ceremonies in secret, but all who are initiated know that the import of Hiram’s death is exactly analogous to that of Christos, and that the third degree is symbolically similar to the Euchari stic rite, which in the early Church was enacted with the same secrecy and mystery as is still observed in the raising of a master mason.

Their Land was a Type of Heaven. ” — B UNYAN , “Solomon’s Temple,” p. 4 . I T would appear that the same system of cosmic imit ation which was applied to the temples was ex - tended on a larger scale to countries and cities, and even to the whole inhabitable world. Strabo, the oldest classical writer on geography whose work has survived to our time, says, “in its figure the habita ble earth resembles a chlamys or soldier’s cloak.” He computers its breadth to be under 30,000 stadiam and its length at 70,000 , thus the length of the habitable earth is above twice its breadth. Now the Greek word chlamys has the numerical value of 1,2 71 , and consequently by Gematria it is equivalent to stauros , a cross, and the proportions of a rood cross being in the ratio of 28 : 13 , its length is rather more than double its breadth. However, if the length of such a cross were 70,000 , its transvers e beam would measure 32,500 , so that the measurements only approximate those of a rood cross. Still the use of the word chlamys , and the entirely arbitary limit to the in - habitable space of the world suggests a mystical intention on Strabo’s part. 1 1 The symbol of the world has been for centuries a cross within a circle, and the name mundus has the value of 406 ,"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 302 Kosmas , an Egyptian monk of the sixth century, in his “Christian Topography” tried to prove that the earth was a rectangle, whose length was more than twice its breadth. Ephorus, again, appears to have divided the world saltire - wise, after the image of the M icrocosm, for he says, “if the whole celestial and terrestrial globe were divided into four parts, the Indians would possess that towards the east, the Ethiopians towards the south, the Kelts towards the west, and the Scythians towards the north” (Strab o, bk. i., ch. 28 ). Thus it seems evident that the ancient geographers mapped out the world, according to some of the canonical forms which have been described in the preceding pages. But not only was the whole earth conceived as an illustration of the Canon law, but every country was seemingly made to conform to the same hypothetical standard — Palestine, for instance, being regarded by the Jews and Christians as the Canonical land, while a similar idea guided the Greeks in assigning a mystical significa nce to the various regions and cities of their country. The word Canaan applied to the Holy Land seems to have some connection with the word canon. In Greek, kanèn 1 is derived from k£nna or k£nnh , a reed, and meant a measuring rod or carpenter’s rule. The Hebrew word for a reed is QNH (Kanah), and the equivalent of T H V , Tau, and the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 1,276 , the height of a rood cross which wil l crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . Ac - cordingly, when we see the cruciform figure drawn upon Eb - storf’s map (p. 316 ), we can perhaps understand the intention of Strabo when he said that the habitable earth was in shape like a soldi er’s cloak (Chlamys, 1,271 ). 1 The word ÑfqalmÒj , the eye, is equivalent by Gematria to Kanon , and it is said in the Talmud, that “the world is like the eyeball of a man: the white is the ocean which surrounds the world, the black is the world itself, th e pupil is Jerusalem, and the image of the pupil is the Temple.”"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 303 is presumably of kindred origin. Numerically QNH is equivalent to 155 , and this number denotes its purport as a symbol. For, by the proportions of Cesariano’s lesser figure, 155 4 / 5 measures the phallus of a man, who is 1,480 high, that is, of a man stretched crosswise within the Holy Oblation. And the land of Canaan, or Palestine, measures from Dan to Beersheba about 155 miles. The Hebrew name ΚΝΑΑΝ yields 840 , a number already discussed under the n ame Microcosmos. The Seventy translate Canaanites, Foinikej or Phœnicians, and in Greek Canaan was called CNA , which has the value of 651 , the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 2,046 , the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. All these numbers obviou sly agree in defining the Holy Land as a Microcosm, or lesser image of the world. The Greek word KANWN , 921 , favours a similar interpretation, for 96.8 × 9.5 = 919.6 , or 1 and a fraction less than 921 ; and 96.8 is the radius of the circle containing the square 1,480 , taking the sun’s distance at 10 . The word would therefore mean the rule, or scale, which measures the universe by the figure of a man. Menasseh Ben Israel (“Conciliator,” vol. ii., p. 115 ) says, that the body has 248 members, 365 nerves, and 307 bones; those three numbers amount to 920 , and sum up all the philosophy of the Hebrew law in a man’s body.

Here we have the number 613 in the ”Holy One — blessed by He!” (“Talmudic Miscell.,” p. 325 ).

So the Radius , or rod, was like the hollow reed ( n arthex ), which “has shown itself a teacher of every art” (Æschylus).

Analogous to the narthex of Prometheus was the Syrinx, or Pipe of Pan. The story of its origin is told by Longus as follows: “This Syrinx, the musicke whereof hath been from Pan recounted always so excellent, was not at the first an instr u - ment, but was a faire young maide, of favour and feature most singular & perfect, wel loved she to chaunt foorth hir laies, with grace most wonderful, and harmonic right pleasant. . . .

Numerically Syrinx has a similar signi - ficance, 773 ( Sàrig x ) being 1 and a fraction less than the perimeter of the Holy Oblation ( 193.6 × 4 = 774.4 ). Apollo’s Lyre was likewise conceived as a counterpart of this, Lyra having the value of 531 , the width of a vesica whose length is 921 ( kanwn ), and Callimachus relates that “swans, tuneful minstrels of the god, having left Mæonian Pactolus, circled seven times around Delos, and chaunted over Leto in childbirth, birds of the muses as they are, most tuneful of winged fowl. Hence afterward the boy fitted to the lyre just so many strings, as the times the swans had chaunted over her throes ” (Hymn to Delos, v. 250 ). And again he says, “Thee, fragrant Asterie, the islands circle round about, and, as it were, encom - pass thee with a choir.” The Greeks apparently rec ognized that the Egyptian Osiris personified the Canon, for his name, according to Plutarch, is equal to 920 ( `USIRIS ).

Accordingly, if the cabalistic diagram be drawn upon the map of Greece, so that the summit or “crown” falls upon Mount Olympus, and the “foundation” upon the extremity of Mount Tainaros, it will be seen that Delphi roughly marks the centre of the figure, while the eastern boundary passes through Athens, and just as Canaan is 155.79 miles long, so Greece, from Olympus to Tainaros, measures 249 1 / 4 miles ( 249 1 / 4 × 9 1 / 2 = 2,368 ). The Island of Crete, to the south - east, will supply the tenth step, which is detached from the main figure like an island.

Olympus was the most northern of the two other peaks, Ossa and Pelion, which were gener - ally associated with it.

Then the sum of the three numbers is 1,609 , which is the circumference of a circle 512 in diameter ( 512 × 4 = 2,048 ). The legend that the timber for the ship Argo was hewn on Mount Pelion further indicates its meaning and place in th e triad. Athens, by its position, ought to have the sig - nificance of the fifth step in the diagram, and would symbolize one of the two cabalistic laws. For this reason, apparently, Athene was selected as the goddess of the city, since one of her chief cha racteristics was her personification of the number 5 , her mysterious birth from the forehead of Zeus expressing this idea.

The site of Delphi, the metropolis or canonical city of Greece, was said to have been determined from its being the place where the two eagles of Zeus met. These had been sent, the one from the East and the other from the West, and alighted at the middle point, or navel of the world. According to the Cabala, they would represent the emanations from the fourth and fifth steps. The name Delphi has an obvious connection with Delphys , the womb, and its numerical value is 619 . When this number is read backwards it becomes 916 , the product of 96.45 × 9 1 / 2 ; again 169 × 4 = 676 ; otherwise trans - posed it becomes 691 , the length of the sun’s orbit. Finally 619 is the sum of the numbers of the two names, Helios , 318 , and Selene , 301 , the sun and the moon. This combination of the male and female power s of the universe was expressed in the Temple of Apollo by the Cleft in the rock, and the Tripod, which stood over it.

The Greeks evidently implied the same thing when they said that Deucalion’s Ark rested on Mount Parnassus, at Delphi, a nother omphalos, where the Temple of Apollo with its mystic cave, and the subterranean prison of the Minotaur 1 in Crete express the same idea. The reader may be reminded that the Ark was a symbol analogous to the cross. Ariadne, Deucalion’s sister, ap pears to personify the cosmos, and in the Iliad (bk. xviii., v. 590 ) Daedalus is said to have wrought her a dancing - place ( CorÒj ) in Gnossus, which must refer to the Labyrinth that symbolized the circling dance of the Planets.

In order to illustrate this, we shall now examine in detail the distribution of the city of Jerusalem, the metropolis of the Canonical land of the Hebrews and Christians. The original name of Jerusalem is thought t o have been Salem, mentioned in Gen. xiv. 18 : “And Melchizedeck King of Salem brought forth bread and wine.” S H LM (Salem) has the nu - merical value of 370 , or the width of a rhombus having a perimeter of 1,480 . And the words, MLKI - T Z DQ MLK S H LM (Melchi zedek, King of Salem), yield 754 , the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 2,368 . These numbers seem to accord with the opinions of the fathers concerning the king and the priest of this city, for Melchizedeck was not only regarded by the Jews as the Messiah, but the early Christians variously spoke of him as an Angel, the Holy Ghost, the Logos, or the Son of God appearing in human flesh. By Gematria MLKI - T Z DQ (Melchize - deck), 294 , is equivalent to Ecclesia, a fact which would account for hi s being called the Holy Ghost, who is identical with the spouse of Christ. The city was afterwards known by the name Jebus, and its inhabitants as Jebusites. From this name we derive the number 318 , which is the diameter of the two circles forming a vesica 666 in perimeter. The Greeks gave the number 318 to Helios , the sun, and by transposition 318 becomes 831 . IRVS H LIM (Jerusalem), again, yields 1,156 , which is the width of a vesica 2,004 long, and 2,004 is the measure of the cross composed of the four elements described by Plato in the “Timæeus.” Josephus (vii. 2 ) makes one of the Greek"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 315 names Soluma , 741 , and adds ƒero[n] producing `Ierosoluma , 926 , the Holy Soluma. The number 741 is the circumference of a circle described within the New Jerusalem, t hat is, with a diameter of 236 , while 926 is nearly the square root of the sun’s diameter in miles. In the New Testament we find the name of Jerusalem as `Ierousal¾m , 864 , which is the length of a rhombus 374 2 / 5 broad, or very nearly the length of the side of the city of Ezekiel, and a rhombus whose sides are 216 , the diameter of the sun’s orbit, has a perimeter of 864 . Bearing in mind that Jerusalem occupies an analogous position in the land of Canaan to that of Delphi in Greece, we see that the numb ers attributed to the names of the Jewish metropolis, or omphalos , are singularly appropriate to the city, which was said to be the central point of the world. We have the testimony of Vitruvius, that ancient cities like the Temples were laid out round t he cardo or cross, for he tells us that the area en - closed within the walls of a city should be planned so as to exclude the winds, which are reckoned as being four, eight, or sixteen in number. “To find and lay down their situation, we proceed as fol lows: Let a marble slab be fixed in the centre of the space enclosed by the walls . . . and erect a gnomon in its centre . . . and mark off the divisions or regions of the winds, etc.” (“Vit.,” bk. i. c. 6 ). This method explained by Vitruvius for disp osing the streets to dissipate the violence of the winds, is apparently a mystical artifice to obscure the meaning of the passage, for no city was ever built on such a plan, and if it were, it is extremely doubtful if such an arrangement would have the e ffect claimed for it. But when he pro - ceeds to give the measures of the earth according"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 316 to Eratosthenes, who ascertained from the sun’s shadow at the Equinox that the circuit of the earth was 252,000 stadia, a quarter, an eighth, or a sixteenth part o f which was occupied by each wind, the natural inference to be drawn from these remarks is, that in planning a city it was customary to begin by describing the earth’s cir - cumference round the centre, and marking upon it the points of the compass. This supposition is confirmed by the plan of the city of Nola already alluded to. The ancient city is there shown to be surrounded by a circular wall, 660 paces in diameter, and 2,074 paces in circumference. The circuit of the citadel is given at 924 paces, the square root of the sun's diameter in miles. The circular wall, which is exactly 1 / 1 2 of the earth’s magnitude measured by miles, is divided into twelve equal parts by so many turrets. There are also evidences which seem to justify the assumption, t hat the same practice was adopted by the Jews in setting out Jerusalem. Accord - ingly, on examining the plan of the city to discover upon what principle it is laid out, and whether the sacred places have any relation to the cosmic scheme, the first measur ement we find suggesting such a connection is the distance between the Serpent pool in the west (called also Upper Gibon), and the Church of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives in the east. From the north - west corner of the Pool of the Serpent to the e astern boundary of the Church of the Ascension is a distance of 7,920 feet, or the number of miles in the diameter of the earth. If a meridian line be drawn between these two points, passing through the Golden Gate and the Holy Sepulchre, its centre w ill fall upon the Acra, or Acropolis. And a circle 7,920 feet in diameter described from this centre, will represent the earth’s circumference to a scale of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 317 one foot to a mile. If this circle be divided accord - ing to the method described by Vitruvius in his account of the analemma (bk. ix., ch. 6 ), the latitude of Jerusalem being 31 °, the axis of the earth will be found to pass through the Damascus gate, while the whole city will lie within the space of the Tropics or the path of the sun. In fact t he south - east angle of the Haram wall nearly touches the line of the southern tropic. Next, if a rood cross of the proportions of 28 : 13 be drawn with its centre upon the Acra, or the centre of the world, so that it may bear upon it the crucified figure of Christos within the square 1,480 , the base of the cross will stand upon the Garden of Gethsemane, while the top will reach to the most western point of the city wall. There are also the foundations of an older wall a little to the south, which show that the old western boundary had been fixed at exactly the same distance from the middle of the city. The head of Christos crucified in this manner falls upon the site of the Holy Sepulchre Church, which is built upon Golgotha, the Place of the Skull; and as the Jews personified the Logos under the name of Adam, it is probable that the chapel called the “Skull of Adam” included within the church was introduced there in reference to this fact. The Sepulchre is itself apparently 1,046 1 / 2 feet from the middle of the city, that is, a distance equal to the radius of a circle containing a square whose sides measure 1,480 feet. Jerusalem being in the possession of three peoples professing a distinct religious system, and having holy places peculiar to their cult, it is necessary to treat the Jewish sites captured by the Mohammedans and the precincts of the Holy Sepulchre separately. Nevertheless, the sanctity which had first been extended to the various places"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 318 by the Jews was preserved afterwards both by t he Christians and Mohammedans, who avowedly founded their religion upon the law of Moses. The difficulty of dealing with the city when in the hands of the Jews, lies in the fact that there are no essentially Jewish remains now in existence to work upon. The accounts of the buildings and disposition of the city found in the scriptures and in the gospels are all we have to guide us as to the appearance of ancient Jerusalem. From these sources, however, it is evident that the rabbis regarded their metrop olis as an image of the cabalistic diagram, the castle of Goliath and the western extremity of the city being the place of the Macrocosm; the acra and the haram area, which is said to have contained Solomon’s temple, being apportioned to the Microcosm, whi le the valley of Jehoshophat and the Mount of Olives fall to the Bride. The Jewish way of looking at the city would therefore accord with the orientation of the Temple. But in the Middle Ages, when the Christians built their temples facing the west ins tead of the east, this was reversed, and, if this be remembered, much confusion will be avoided in reading the descriptions of the city written by later pilgrims from the west. Now from the Golden Gate to the extremity of the western wall is a distance of about 3,600 feet, therefore the diagram covering the city, being of the ratio of 26 : 15 , is 2,076 feet broad, or 1 / 1 2 of the circumference of the earth in miles. The citadel occupies the place of the third step, while the site of the Holy Sepulchre falls on the point called Daath, 474 , or knowledge, by the Cabalists. It is the place marked by the head of Microcosmos, which again affords a reason for calling the place Golgotha, the skull. “In three hollow places of the skull the brain is contained.” “I n the third cavity"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 319 Daath, knowledge, is contained and dwelleth.” 1 Further, by Gematria Golgotha is equivalent to Daath, for BGVLGLT H A = 475 or GVLGT H A = 473 , therefore by adding or deducting colel in either case we get 474 = DOT H . The stables of Solomon stand on the eighth Step, and the Golden Gate on the ninth. The sixth Step, Beauty, lies outside the Haram enclosure, to the east of the Acra. The valley of Kedron, called also Tophet or Hinnon, was identified with Hades, and seems to have been always associated with the ideas connected with the tenth Step. Here is found the garden of Gethsemane, called in Arabic “the place of incarnation,” the Church of the Tomb of the Virgin, and the Tombs of Jehoshophat, Absalom, Zachariah, and St. James. Towards the south is the pool of Siloam, and the Virgin’s well. The holy places of Jerusalem being thus included within the circumference of the earth, the city and its precincts are an exact microcosm. That it was regarded as such, and that Christ was accept ed as a personification of the old microcosmic deity of the Greeks, is made clearly manifest by a thirteenth - century geographer, who has left us a map of the world (exhibited in the King’s Library of the British Museum), in which the figure of Jesus is expanded, in the form of a cross like the macrocosm of Cesariano. His body, symbolically comprising the whole world, is depicted by its extremities only, his head in the east, his two hands in the north and south, and his feet in the west. In this map w e see a literal presentation of the crucified Logos, unobscured by the metaphorical disguise of the customary fables; for it was thus 1 See Kabbalah Unveiled , “Greater Holy Assembly,” ch. xxviii., “On the Brain of Microprosopus” (p. 180 )."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 320 “He stretched out His hands on the cross, that He might encompass the ends of the world;” and “wrought salvation in the m iddle of the earth.” 1 St. Augustine, who knew this well, explains the mystery not less surely but more cautiously; he says, “the first letters of the words North, South, East and West in Greek form the word Adam. Adam is, therefore, the type of all na tions. But these Greek letters, being taken according to the value of their numbers, make 46 .

Moreover, the breadth of a vesica 2,210 long is 1,275 , which is the height of a rood cross which will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . And 2,211 is the sum of the two numbers 1,101 (Macroprosopos) and 1,110 (Microprosop os). Again, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 46 is 1,081 , the radius of the moon and the symbol of the four elements of which the body of the Logos was made. So the verity of the symbolic crucifixion is as skilfully and unmistak - 1 St. Cyril, “Cat. Lect.,” xiii. 28 ."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 321 ably adumbrated by the words of St. Augustine as by the map of the geographer. Bearing in mind the primitive ideas of theology, it becomes at once apparent why the Greeks, Jews and Christians chose to consider their country and metropolis to be in the middle of the world. 1 For we see in this monkish map that Jerusalem is built over the centre of Christ's body, thereby acquiring its reputed sanctity; and the symbol, by which this Christian priest has notified the mystery of the holy city, would be quite as appropriate to Heliop olis, Babylon, and Delphi, as Jerusalem. Within the four square walls there is drawn the figure of Christos issuing from an oblong tomb, intended to represent the Holy Sepulchre or omphalos of the world. Nor does his piety allow him to omit the cross, for by the addition of the two soldiers 2 still asleep outside the sarcophagus, the mystic triad is ingeniously included in the com - position. In the Hereford map the walls of Jerusalem are made round, in the image of the navel, while the cross stands u p outside the walls. Thus we distinctly see why the writers of the Gospel selected the centre of the world wherein to lay the scene of the crucifixion, the central feature and climax of their parable. The actual navel - stone of Jerusalem is not shown in the Acra or centre of the city, but in the middle of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre — the reason of this probably being, that the Chris - 1 “The land of Israel is situated in the centre of the world, and Jeru salem in the centre of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the centre of Jerusalem, and the Holy of Holies in the centre of the Temple, and the foundation - stone on which the world was founded is situated in front of the ark.” — H ERSHON , “ Talmudic Misce llany,” p. 300 . 2 The two soldiers are representatives of the Armies (Tzabaoth) mentioned in the Cabala. “Lesser Holy Assembly,” ch. xxii., §§ 740 , 741 and 742 (Mathers, Kabbalah Unveiled , p. 337 )."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 322 tians preferred to especially consecrate a place of their own when they succeeded the Jews. Ac - cordingly we find that the navel - stone marks the centre of Christ’s body, if crucified on a rood cross inscribed within the circle of the earth, 7,920 feet in diameter. We further see from Ebstorf’s map that the Christian Paradise corresponds to the head of Macrocosmos ( 831 ), and the three first steps of the Cabalistic Diagram. According to Hippolytus (Ref., bk. v., ch. iv.) the Nasseni “suppose that man, as far as the head only, is Paradise.” The “man” being Adam ( 'Adamaj , 247 ), the Macro - cosm, or as shown on the map, Chri stos. 1 All the holy places of Jerusalem, as well as those of the greater world being associated with the parts of the human body, it was probably for this reason, that the footprints of Jesus were shown in the Church of the Ascension, where the feet of the Macrocosm appear on the map. Like the travels of Pausanias, the diaries of the pilgrims who journeyed to Jerusalem in the early days of the Church are most valuable records of antiquity, revealing the spirit of the old world, interpreting naturally a nd unfeignedly its own conceptions, without any of the effort and learned affectation required by a modern traveller to adjust a new mind to an old subject. For every quota - tion and observation they make is a valuable critic - ism, and to the instructed, it is overwhelmingly evident, that the saintly pilgrims of the Middle Ages saw a very different parable in the sites and episodes of the Gospel than that which is dis - cernible to one of Mr. Cook’s tourists. An old 1 In a mediæval map of Jerusalem Solomon’s Temple stands in Paradise, Golgotha in the middle of the world, and the Holy Sepulchre in the west occupies the place of the Bride.

The descriptions of these pious travellers are so ample, that we are left in no doubt as to the general significance of the holy places, and so systematic ally do the localities appear to have been fixed, that since the Land of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the churches or cathedrals were all microcosms, exactly delineated, it was possible to assign every event of Christ’s passion to its proper place in the world , in the city and in the Temple. Accordingly we find in the churches, as at Chartres, a labyrinth with Jerusalem in its centre, just as the corresponding place in the city itself was also called Jerusalem. At Durham there is the Galilee Chapel at the w est, corresponding to the Galilee on the Mount of Olives. 1 Elsewhere we find a calvarium, golden and beautiful gates, but whether the places were marked or not, they could be located by measurement, and any mediæval Chris - tian could make a pilgrimage ro und his cathedral, to all intents and purposes, as though he were in Jerusalem. 1 “On the other side of the Church (of the Ascension) is the chapel where our Lord Jesus Christ first appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection, andit is called Galilee, as he said to the Apostles, ‘After I am risen again, I will go before you unto Galiliee.’ ” (Saewulf’s Travels.) He also mentions ”the Galilee of Mount Sion.” Sir John Maundville says, ”After Mount Olivet is the Mount of Galilee, where the Apostles assembled when Mary Magdalene came and told them of Christ’s ascension. And there between Mount Olivet and the Mount of Galilee is a church where the angel fore told our Lady of her death.” He also mentions (ch. viii.) “a deep cave under the rock, which is called the Galilee of our Lord, where St. Peter hid himself when he had forsaken our Lord.” Again, in the “City of Jerusalem,” it is said, “in this Church (of the Ascension) is the place where Holy Mary died in Galilee.”"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 324 It was this mystical order that Eusebius seems to have had in his mind, when describing the Basilica of Constantine with its threefold division, agreeing with the cabalistic diagram. The Sepul - chre, or cave in the west, he says, marking the place of the Macrocosm was joined to an open court, “paved with shining stones,” in which was the navel of the world. Next to this was the Martyrium, its apse standing over Golgotha, where a hemisphere was “girt with 12 pillars, according to the number of the Apostles of the Saviour” — these are of course the 12 signs of the Zodiac, surrounding the body of Christos crucified in their midst. And the vestibule, or atrium in the east w as the appointed symbol of the Bride. It is recorded by an anonymous pilgrim who visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Middle Ages, that “in the midst of the choir is the middle of the world, where our Lord was laid, when Nicodemus took him dow n from the cross.” A similar statement occurs in the “Citez de Jherusalem”: “Near to the Holy Sepulchre, that is to say, in the choir where is the compass of our Lord , is also the place where Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea placed his blessed body” ( Capt. Conder’s trans., p. 34 ). Again we learn from Theoderich, the pilgrim, that “about the middle of the choir [of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre] there is a small open altar of great sanctity, on the flooring whereof is marked a cross inscribed in a circle, which signifies that on this spot Joseph and Nicodemus laid our Lord’s body, in order to wash it, after they had taken it down from the cross.” The “cross inscribed in a circle” probably refers to the figure of the Microcosm stretched within th e sphere of the Zodiac.

The top of the head also marks the attitude of the pole above the horizon, according to the latitude of Jerusalem. And a line drawn southwards at right angles to the axis of the church from the crown of the head touches th e eastern extremity of the Chapel of the Skull of Adam, thereby implying that Adam's Skull is no other than that of the hypothetical Man, or Microcosm whose body was made to measure the universe. Without having the exact dimensions to work upon it would be hazardous to say more about this pre - eminently important church, but it is to be hoped that the deficiency with respect to the measures will be supplied. According to Eusebius, when Constantine projected the building of his Basilica, he discovered a “mou nd of Venus” raised over the Saviour’s tomb (“Life of Constantine”). The earliest travellers describe the Sepulchre as being a separate struc - ture surrounded by pillars enclosed by a circular wall, having the entrance facing the east. Its position in t he present building corresponds to the narthex, or baptistry of a primitive church, or the porch of Solomon's Temple. The name Anastasis , Resurrection, has the value of 963 , and is equi - valent by Gematria to tšcnh , art. The account of Bernard the wise is that the four principal churches in Jerusalem were “con - nected with each other by walls; one to the east, 1 The only available plan of this church (that of the Ordnance Survey) gives no measurements.

Between the aforesaid four churches is a parvis without roof, the walls of which shine with gold, and the pavement is laid with very precious stone; and in the middle four chains, coming from each of the four churches, join in a point which is said to be the middle of the world.” 1 Bernard is the only pilgrim who mentioned these four “chains,” but they are doubtless the cross - l ines of the cardinal points or quarters. The same adherence to the canonical pattern seems to have made the priests declare that it was on this spot that Adam was formed, and that here Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac. Here also Jacob saw the mystic Ladder. Even the horn, wherewith David was anointed, was seen here, as was also in after times “the banquet hall ( missorium ), where the head of John the Baptist was brought before Herod the King.” Here again is displayed the “hole in which it is know n that the cross was fixed; into which hole pilgrims, out of the love and respect which they bear to Him that was crucified, are wont to plunge their head and face,” and close by, in a little shrine, was the “cup of our Lord which Arculf touched 1 “At the head of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the wall outside, not far from the place of Calvary, is the place called Compas, which our Lord Jesus Christ himself signified and measured with his own hand as the middle of t he world, according to the words of the Psalmist, ‘For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.’ (Psalm lxxiv. 12 ).

These are a few of the things that happened and w ere seen at this site, but many more are mentioned by the pious pilgrims, whose works may be consulted. 1 It was apparently for similar reasons that the Druids held their great festival “at a consecrated place in the territories of the Carnutes, whose coun try is supposed to be in the middle of Gaul ” (Caesar, Gallic Com., bk. vi., c. 13 ), and as the institution is said to have come originally from Britain, there was probably a correspondingly holy place in the centre of our island. In Christian times the o mphalos of England appears to have been reckoned in Lichfield, in the county of Staffordshire. We learn from Camden that “the people whereof as living in the heart of England, are called in Bede Angli mediterranei . . . it lies from south to north, al most in the form of a rhombus, being broad in the middle, but narrow and contracted towards the ends.” Bede calls it Licidfield, which Rouse of Warwick renders “a field of carcasses,\" and tells us that many Christians suffered martyrdom there. Accordin g to some authorities the number of the martyrs was 888 , the diameter of the circle enclosing the New Jeru - salem, which is in the middle of the universe. “This worde Lichefelde,” says Lydgate, who de - scribed the slaughter by the paynyms , “by inter - preta tion, is . . . a felde that lyeth full of bodyes dead,” while the manner in which Amphibalus was put to death, suggesting the ritualistic ceremonies 1 See the publications of the Palestine Pilgrim text society."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 328 of a pagan sacrifice, is no doubt related with a mystical intention. One of the “paynyms,” he con - tinues (“Life and Passion of St. Alban and St. Amphibalus”), “Like a bocher (butcher) persed his entrayles, This homycyde tranne afore the route Raffe his navylle , and toke out his bowelles, And at a stake whiche that stode without Tyed like ropes evyn rounde a bout, And with a scurge the martyr he gan make In circle wyse to go aboute the stake.” Then they threw swords, daggers, spears, and knives at him, but “ever the more again they did malign, the more they found him gracious and benign.” Kircher (“Œdipus,” to m. ii., pars ii., p. 358 ) has depicted the Microcosm standing in the midst of the planets with his body cut open, so that the intestines are seen in a spiral coil encircling the navel. It is an ugly simile; but it seems that the ancients derived the ide a of the Labyrinth from the tortuous winding of the entrails round the omphalos , and they were likened to the orbits of the planets surrounding the earth, or navel of the universe. Delos is said to have been visited by Theseus on his return from Crete, wh ere he had slain the Minotaur; “and having sacrificed to Apollo, and dedicated in the temple the image of Aphrodite, which Ariadne had given him, he danced with the young Athenians a dance that in memory of him is still preserved among the inhabitants of Delos, and which by its various turnings and involutions imitated the intricate windings of the Labyrinth. And this dance, as Dicaearchus writes, is called among the Delians the Crane. This he danced round the Ceratonian altar, so called from its bein g built entirely of horns; and these were"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 329 taken only from the left side of the head.” (Plutarch’s “Theseus.”) This dance has probably an anatomical as well as an astral significance, and the speech in the Hymn of Callimachus in refer - ence to the navel at Delphi appears to have a similar meaning; “nor yet hath died the huge serpent, but still that monster with dreadful jaws, creeping down from Plistus, enwreaths snowy Parnassus with nine coils .” (“Hymn to Delos,” v. 92 .) In Lydgate’s poem the coiling of the entrails of Amphibalus round the stake seems to be an obvious imitation of the circling of the planets round the pole, whose emblem was the serpent Draco, and it is probable that the entrails were used for some such reason as this, in the old sa cri - ficial rites. Amphibalus, the “cloak” of St. Alban, takes the second place in the legend, and it must be borne in mind that Christ’s death on Golgotha was the prototype of all the martyrdoms of the Saints. It is therefore natural that the “cloak” of the first English martyr to Christianity should be sacrificed at Lichfield, called by Bede mediter - ranean, or in the centre of the world. Now taking a point a little to the south of Lich - field as a centre, we find that the circumference of a circle 220 miles in diameter passes through London. And London has the numerical value of 924 , the square root of the sun’s diameter in miles. Stephanus in his “Book of Cities” calls it LindÒnion , which yields 344 , the diameter of a circle 1,081 in circumference (Camden). Again, if the sphere of the Zodiac be drawn within the Holy Oblation with the same centre, and taking a furlong to be equivalent to the sun’s diameter, the square enclosing the body of Christos passes through the city of York in the north, and t hrough Stonehenge in the south. The square of"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 330 the Holy Oblation passes through Canterbury and the Isle of Wight; whether the name of “Wight,” a man, has any reference to this fact, or that the right hand of a man inscribed within a circle 2,368 in dia meter touches the “Isle of Man,” has any connection with its name, we have no idea. Supposing Lichfield to have been the navel of England, it may be that the singular revels anciently celebrated at Coventry, lying about twenty - five miles to the south - e ast, had a phallic origin. Camden derives the name from Con - ventus , a convent, and, amongst other things, says that their Cross for beauty and workmanship is inferior to few in England. Its height appears to have been 57 feet ( 57 × 9 1 / 2 = 541 , the side of a rhombus having a perimeter equal to the moon’s diameter). The annual procession in memory of Godiva, represented by a naked figure riding on horseback, was still continued in Camden’s time, and several of the old mystery plays enacted by the trade guilds are yet extant. One of these, published by Sharp, is a dramatized life of Noah, a subject which entirely accords with the nature of the place. In pre - Christian times the great city in the middle of England was Caerleon, or the city of Legions. It was the seat of an Archflamen, along with London and York. But when the new cult was established the two archbishops were con - fined to the north and south. The finding of the true cross has a personal interest for Englishmen, for (if Jeffrey of Mon - mouth spoke the truth) St. Helena, who surpassed all the ladies of her time in beauty and skill in music, was the daughter of King Cole of Colchester. It is true that Colchester is not the only city named as her birth - place, but its claims are certainl y"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 331 as good as those of any other. Jeffrey calls it “Kaercolvin, id est Colecestriæ” (lib. v., cap. 6 ), and when that name is resolved into a number, its relation to the true cross may be explained thus: 401 is 1 less than the breadth of a vesica formed by two intersecting circles whose united width is 1,206 , which is the side of a rhombus inscribed within the Holy Oblation containing the cruciform body of Christos. Helena yields 96 , and 96.8 is the radius of Holy Oblation if the sun’s distance be tak en at 10 . Again, the name of her son Con - stantine ( Kwnstantinoj ), the first Christian emperor, has the value of 2,051 , or about the diameter of Saturn’s orbit, while 2,051 + 98 ( `Elenh ) = 2,149 + 2 = 2,151 . In Latin, Constantinus yields 378 , the side of a rhombus having a perimeter of ( 377 5 / 6 × 4 =) 1,510 , the numerical equivalent of Ci , Rw , ! the Labarum or standard fashioned as the emblem of Constantine’s vision. Finally, 378 (Constantinus) + 96 (Helena) = 474 , the number of the name Golgotha, where the cross was discovered in the year A.D . 326 ( 325 1 / 2 × 2 = 651 ). According to the traditions the cross was made of the wood of the Tree of Paradise; and we see on Ebstorf’s map that Paradise is situated beside the head of Christ or Macrocosmos, and the tree stands between Adam and Eve, the ce ntral feature of a triad evidently corresponding to the first three steps of the Cabala. We are told that Adam, who died at the age of 930 years, was buried with a branch of the Tree of Paradise in his mouth. This branch took root and grew to be a tree, and, having incorporated the body of Adam in its stem, they say that for this reason Adam's head is always shown on the up - right beam of the cross on old crucifixes. After - wards Noah carried it through the flood in the Ark. It was next brought to Jer usalem with the"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 332 other materials of which the temple was built. But no place could be found for it in the building, so it lay on the ground unregarded except by the careless people, who scraped their muddy feet upon it; till the Queen of Sheba, passing that way, saw it, wiped it with her own clothes, and adored it. After that, it seems to have taken root again, for “they show a place encircled by walls near Jerusalem, where it is said the tree grew from which the Holy Cross was made” (Abbot Daniel). Then on Golgotha, and in a garden (St. Cyril, Cat. Lect. XIII., 8 ) the salvation of mankind having been achieved, the cross, as in former times, lay neglected for 293 years, when the devotion of St. Helena drew attention to it again. A simple geometrica l demonstration is all that is required to disclose the verity of the tradition. For the distance from the navel - stone in the centre of the Holy Sepulchre Church to the place of the invention is about 200 feet. And, since it has been shown that the said stone coincides with the navel of the Microcosm crucified on a rood cross inscribed within the circumference of the earth, it will be at once apparent how St. Helena came to find the cross just at the spot where the chapel stands to commemorate it ( see the Ordnance Survey of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre). The old artists, who were piously instructed in the Ecclesiastical Tradition, always represented St. Helena and the cross according to the mystic sense. That the theoretical treatment was sti ll known in the sixteenth century is attested by one of the most beautiful pictures in the world — that of Paolo Caliari (National Gallery, No. 1041 ). The artist has depicted the invention as a visionary revelation merely, but he has taken care that the m ystery of the true cross is presented with signi - ficant accuracy."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"GEOGRAPHY. 333 Countries and cities appear to have been named upon the same microcosmic principle as the world itself.

H ISTORY , it has been said, has two eyes, Chrono - logy and Geography. Having already touched upon historical phenomena in relation to the latter science, we shall now briefly treat of the epochs and sequ ence of time, as viewed by old historians. Strauchis (“Chronology,” p. 2 ), says that “the chronologer disposeth times, and gives certain characters of them; the historian records things done and fills up thespaces, which the other leaves empty. . . . Ye a, Scaliger (“Proleg. in Euseb.”) makes chronology to be the soul of history, and to excel it as much as the soul doth the body.” He adds further, that “it assumes most of its principles out of astronomy.” According to these authorities history is made a mere accessory to chronology, and occupies a place exactly the reverse of that which we are accustomed to give it at the present day. For, according to them, the times must be first established, and then a sequence of events found to fit them. That c hronology did actually affect the composition of ancient history seems to be indis - 1 10 + 22 = 32 , which is the square root of 1,024, the radius of Saturn’s orbit."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 335 putable, and there is every reason to believe that the eminent Scaliger was not mistaken in exalting chronology as the guiding spirit of history. 1 It is well known that the epochs and cycles of the ancients were arranged according to a canonical system. Ptolemy's chronological canon of the Ptolemaic dynasty is still extant, and Plutarch (“Life of Solon,” p. 307 , Edin., 1763 ), speaking of Solon’s interview with Croesus, says that he can - not reject it as fictitious because it does not agree with “some chronological canons, which thousands have endeavoured to regulate, and yet to this day could never bring the different accounts to any agreement.” It is, moreover, clearly evi dent that the period reckoned from the creation of the world to the birth of Christ belongs to the category of canonical or artificial computations referred to by Plutarch. This imaginary cycle is so obviously fictitious that modern churchmen, committed as they are to a literal acceptance of the Scriptures, rather than support the reality of this epoch prefer the ignominious and absurd alternative of believing the history while rejecting the dates. If Strauchius be correct these semi - believers are le aning on the more shadowy support of the two, for he says, “in relating matters of fact History pretends to no demonstrations: but Chronology produces the firmest that are.” And this must necessarily be so, if the history of the world from the creation to the birth of Christ is an ingeniously compiled chronicle, relating in canonical order events appro - 1 A distinction ought to be made between sacred and profane history — as, for instance, between the works of Homer or Moses and, say, those of Thucydides or writers who aimed at veracity simply. When Pythagoras went down into Hell, he found Homer’s soul hung upon a tree, surrounded by serpents, as a punishment for having related fabulous stories about the gods ( D IOGENES L AERTES , “Life of Pythagoras”). He does not seem to have noticed the soul of Moses."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 336 priate to the numbers of the years determined by the length of the cycle. Upwards of fifty different computations of this important epoch have been made by Christian chronologers (Strauchius, p. 166 ), who reckon the interval at from 3,760 to 6,484 years. When the chief of these reckonings are severally examined, it would seem that the chronological canon was constructed in accordance with the fundamenta l doctrines of the Cabala, explained in the case of the other arts. For the three persons of the Triad representing the whole scheme of creation from the firmament to the earth symbolize, in the period of time occupied by the events of the Old Testament, the mediating powers by which the emanation of God or germ of life descended from heaven, and became incarnate on earth in the body of Jesus Christ. And since the exposition of the Cabala is easily effected by numbers, the com - putation of the years i n any cycle was a simple means of mystically supplying a measurement, which conveyed to the philosophers a representa - tion of the three symbolic persons. Consequently it is necessary to resolve the period into three terms, so that a proper number fall s to each person, the result of the varying length of the cycle being that the symbolical meaning of the events will be capable of a variable interpretation. According to Strauchius (p. 166 ), the Greeks constituted the period from the creation of the wor ld to the birth of Christ at 5,598 years. Now the three obvious numbers appropriate to the persons of the Cabala, which may be deduced from 5,598 are 2,368 , 2,151 , and 1,080 ( 2,368 + 2,151 + 1,080 = 5,599 ). These numbers, as already ex - plained, accura tely describe the three parts of the universe, the Empyrean, the Zodiac together with the planets, and the Sublunary, or elementary world."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 337 The Constantinopolitans and Alexandrians counted 5,508 years as the canonical period. And this number is made up o f 2,368 , 2,093 , and 1,047 — the first being, as before, the numerical equivalent of Jesus Christ, the second the diameter of the circle containing the square 1,480 (Christos), and the third number, being the radius of the same circle, applies to the femini ne half of the Logos. The cycle of the Æthiopic church is 9 less than the preceding, so that the numbers become 2,368 , 2,083 1 / 3 , and 1,046 1 / 2 . The only difference is that the Holy Oblation signifying Christ is indicated by the mean number 2,083 1 / 3 , instea d of 2,093 . In our English Bible the cycle is set down at 4,004 years. This is a late calculation made by Archbishop Ussher in the seventeenth century, but it was evidently adopted by the English Church for sound theological reasons. The three numbers into which the period may be resolved are 2,083 , 1480 , and 441 . Consequently we get the dimensions of the universe as measured by the bodies of the Macrocosm and the Microcosm in their due relation to each other (or nearly so), while the number of the third person is the measure of a cross drawn within the sun's orbit ( 220 × 2 = 440 ). This is a most instructive triad, well worthy of consideration as manifesting the hidden doctrine. The first and second persons exhibit the duplication of the square illustrated by the figures of Cesariano, and the sun’s orbit, being the e mblem of the new Jerusalem or city of the sun, marks the omphalos and stauros in the middle of the world. 1 1 A vesica 441 broad is 766 long, and a sqare whose sid es are 766 has a diagonal of 1,083 , the radius of the moon; and such a square is contained within a rhombus inscribed in the Holy Oblation, so that every attribute of the Bride or Holy Ghost are implied by the number 441 .

Haynlinus chose the number 3,963 , the number of miles in the earth’s radius.

Even the reckoning of the Jews brings out a mystical triad, for 3,760 may be divided into 2,083 , 1,480 , and 197 — the twelfth of 2,368 being 197 1 / 3 . Strauchius, on p. 382 , gives the following quota - tion from the Roman Martyrology published by the authority of Pope Gregory XIII, and publicly read every year on Christmas Day: “In the 5199 th year from the crea tion of the world, when God created Heaven and Earth; and the 2,957 th after the Deluge; the 2,015 th from the birth of Abraham; 1,510 th from Moses, and the time of the Israelites leaving Egypt; and 1,032 nd from the time of David's being anointed king; i n the 65 th annual week of Daniel; in the 194 th Olympiad; in the 752 nd year since the building of Rome; in the 42 nd year of the Emperor Octavius Augustus, when the whole world was blessed with peace; in the 6 th Age of the world; Jesus Christ, Eternal G od, and Son of the Eternal Father, conceived from the Holy Ghost, was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judaea.” The entire cycle of 5,199 years may be divided into 2,368 , 2,083 , and 748 – the last number being the AMT H , truth , and Ð lÒgoj (deducting colel), the word, yield 441 ."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 339 side of a square contained in a rhombus inscribed within the orbit of Saturn. But, leaving the other numbers, the remarkable fact in the preceding passage is the striking numerical coincidence in the years according to the reckonings of Greece and Rome. Counting by the Greek chronol ogy, Christ was born in the 194 th Olympiad. Now 193.6 is the side of the Holy Oblation, if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 : and 194 Olympiads are 776 (= 194 × 4 ) years; and the transverse beam of a rood cross 776 high is 360 , the number of degrees i n the earth’s circumference. Then, count - ing by the Roman chronology, the year 752 from the founding of the city is 1 less than the diameter of a circle 2,368 in circumference. This curious coincidence, occurring at a time when the sun had passed into a new sign of the Zodiac, and when consequently a new Messiah was required, strangely confirms, by the appearance of the Gospel, the suggested influence of chronology upon history. Christ (supposing him to have been a real per - sonage) was not the only cl aimant to the honour of personifying the Logos. The fathers give accounts of similar pretensions on the part of Marcus, Basilides, Marcion, and others, while the intro - duction of the cults of Abraxas, 365 , and Mithras, 360 , at Rome may be attributed to s ome such cause as this.

He declared himself to be a personification of the Father ( Simon , 1,100 = Macroprosopos , 1,101 ), and showed himself among the Jews as Christ, “not in the flesh, but in appearance; and after this, as the Holy Ghost, of whom Christ had promised that he should be sent as the Comforter” (St. Cyril, Lect. VI.). We are also told that Claudius set up a statue to him inscribed “To Simon, the Holy God” ( Ibid .). In the third century Manes, a Persian, also pro - claimed himself to be a personification of the Holy Ghost, or Logos, for Manes in Persian means speech. He appears to have healed the sick, and performed wonders like Simon Magus and the rest. He was worshipped by disciples, persecuted by other Christian sects, and like the gentle Christos, was taken prisoner, condemned as a malefactor, and havi ng been flayed alive, consum - mated his martyrdom with every accompaniment of infamy (St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Cat.

A fondness for the worship of the Virgin was characteristic of the theology of this century, and it resulted in the introduction of the doctrine of transubstantiation decreed 1,215 (by transposition 2,151 ), besides the addition of new offices especi ally addressed to the Mother of God.

The Age of the Father, or the old law, they considered to have lasted till the first century, when the Logos was incarnated in the body of Jesus, and there was not wanting a woman in the thirteenth century, Wilhelmina by name, who undertook to personate the Holy Ghost. Her doctrine was that “all that had happened to Christ during His appearance upon earth in the human nature, was to be exactly renewed in her person, or rather in that of the Holy Ghost, which was united to her.” She died at Milan, says Mosheim, “in the most fragrant odour of sanctity, and her memory was not only held in the highest ve neration by her numerous followers and the ignorant multitude, but was also honoured with religious worship both in public and private” (“Eccles. Hist.,” p. 349 ). These opinions, according to Guillaume de St. Amour, were first propagated in the year 1200 , although Joachim’s “Everlasting Gospel,” which named the year 1260 as the beginning of the New Age, was not published till 1254 . The reason of the appearance of these prophecies was probably due to the fact that, according to the theory of mystical numb ers, the year 1200 was remarkable because a vesica 1,201 broad is 2,083 long, and 2,083 being the size of the Holy Oblation enclos - ing the sphere of the Zodiac, that number was the symbol of the Holy Spirit.

The number 1,260 is not so easily accounted for, unless it be that it is composed of the figures 2,160 transposed. In the ecclesiastical computation of time there are two great cycles observed, one of the sun and one of the moon. The Lunar cycle is compose d of 235 lunations of nineteen solar years, and by it the golden number of the calendar is adjusted. The solar cycle consists of a period of twenty - eight years, and determines the changes of the Dominical letter. It is assumed that the precession of th e equinoxes or great year 1 constituted the third cycle during one month of which the Messiah was supposed to rule. The commemoration of the saints in the calendar afforded another means of chronicling the doctrine of theology with respect to numbers. Fo r the feasts, dedicated to the spirits or souls of the holy persons canonized by the church, appear to be distributed in a numerical order throughout the circle of the year, to symbolize the choir of saints who filled the sphere of heaven. The Puritans h ave shown (Gale, “Court of the Gentiles,” vol. iii., p. 184 , etc.) that the invocation of saints was instituted by the Christians in imita - tion of the rites with which the pagans honoured their demons (spirits). 2 It was thought that when 1 The precessional cycle, like other hidden matters, was brought to light by Copernicus.

Plato, in the “Cratylus,” calls these spirits mediators be - tween gods and men. And according to both, they are the souls or spirits of departed heroes, who dwell and move about the intermediate space between the gods and mortals. To go deeper into the matter we must consider what theories the old philosophers had about the soul. Cicero has preserved some of the ancient notions in the “Vision of Scipio,” who is brought in a dream to the abode of the shades. He is there instructed by the spirit of Africanus his father, as to the nature of the place and the condition of souls after death, and is informed that “ ‘a soul has been supplied to th em [men] from those eternal fires which you call constellations and stars . . . and the assembly of those who have lived before, and who, having been released from their bodies inhabit that place which thou beholdest.’ Now the place my father spoke of was a radiant circle of dazzling brightness amid the flaming bodies you, as you have learned from the Greeks, term the Milky Way. . . . ‘All things,’ he continues, ‘are connected by nine circles or rather spheres: the outermost of which is heaven, their Holy - dayes, an exact Øpokrisij , or Imitamen of these Pagan Hymnes? . . . .

But Plato speaks of demons or spirits, who are “intermediate between the divine and the mortal,” and who can be no other than the seven planets encircling the earth and filling the interval between it and heaven. The action of the soul in its passage through the planets is obscurely referred to by Macrobius in his commentary on Sci pio’s dream (ch. xii.). “The soul, therefore, falling with this first weight, from the Zodiac and Milky Way into each of the subject spheres is not only clothed with the accession of a luminous body but produces the particular motions which it is to exerci se in the respective orbs, etc.” It is also explained by Porphyry (“Cave of the Nymphs,” par. II), that souls descending in gener - ation enter through the “gate” of Cancer, the northern Tropic on their way to an earthly body, and, on their release at dea th, they ascend through"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 345 Capricorn the southern tropic, on their way back to heaven. Those hymns to which Gale draws attention were probably sung in allusion to the celestial music of the spheres, representing the demons, who convey the souls of men dow n to earth and from thence to heaven. Origen has a passage of like purport. “Celsus,” he says, “too agreeably to the opinion of Plato, asserts that souls can make their way to and from the earth through the planets; while Moses, our most ancient proph et, says that a divine vision was presented to the view of our prophet Jacob — a ladder stretching to heaven, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it, and the Lord supported upon its top — obscurely pointing, by this matter of the ladder, ei ther to the same truths which Plato had in view, or to something greater than these.” The number of saints commemorated in the calendar of the English Church has varied with the changes of opinion and jurisdiction which have occurred at different times. In the Prayer Book, as published in the reign of James II., in the year 1680 , the holy days and festivals, including 52 Sundays, amount to 81 ; then there are 16 vigils, the 40 days of Lent, the 12 Ember days, the 3 Rogation days, and lastly, all the Fridays in the year, to which are added “ 3 solemn days,” with appointed services. Consequently, all the days devoted to religious exercises are 207 , which is the diameter of a circle having a circumference of 651 , which in its turn is the diameter of Saturn’s orbit. Again, the total number of saints named in the calendar is 93 , which is the radius of Saturn’s orbit if the sun’s distance be taken at 10 ( 220 : 2,046 :: 10 : 93 ), and 93.8 × 9.5 = 891 ( ouranos ).

According to the usage of the English church the ecclesiastical year begins on the first Sunday of Advent, which falls in the cur rent year upon the 29 th of November, 1896 . Consequently, St Andrew’s Day, fixed for the 30 th of Novem - ber, is observed on the second day of the year. Now St. Andrew, who was said to have been crucified on a cross saltirewise, like the second figure o f Cesariano, is an obvious personification of the Microcosm, and may be appropriately sym - bolized by the number 2 . 1 The square of 30 is 900 , and if 1 and a fraction be added we get the side of a square whose diagonal is 1,275 . St. Thomas’s Day (Decembe r 21 st) falls upon the 23 rd day of the year. This apostle is called in the Gospel, Didymus, the Twin, being regarded as the twin - brother of Christ. In the apocryphal Gospel, “The Acts of the Holy Apostle Thomas,” when the disciples were sent out to al l the corners of the earth to preach, it fell to the lot of Thomas to go to India. At first he was unwilling to go owing to weakness of the flesh, but his brother Christ sold him to a merchant, who had been sent by the King of India to buy a carpente r. Sir John Maundeville, in the thirteenth century, speaks of India as the Antipodes: “The Londes of Prestre John, Emperour of Ynde ben undre us,” he says, “and thei han there the day, whan wee have the nyghte” (ch. xvii.). The southern hemisphere seems to have been fancifully con - ceived as a cup by the ancients. According to the legends, the Holy Grail was preserve in India by Prestre John, and the diagram of a chalice given by Greaves (“English Weights and 1 The days of the month upon which the feasts of the saints are fixed must be considered as well as the days of the y ear, especially as the day of the year yields a variable number."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 347 Measures”) seems to disclose its esoteric mean - ing. It is drawn as a hollow hemisphere or bowl set upon a stem with the twenty - four hour - circles of the earth marked upon it, and is consequently a symbol of the under world. In some of the earliest crucifixes a chalice is shown at the feet of the Saviour. On turning to Cesariano’s Macro - cosm it will be seen that the four points of the compass are clearly distinguished upon it. The head and hands are enclosed by three circles, and the feet by a vesica, the three upper points representing the upper hemisphere or the male, the lower hemisphere being the emblem of the female. In the order of the apostles Thomas stands seventh according to St. Matthew (ch. x.). There - fore supposing St. Peter to correspond to the sign of the fishes, Thomas w ould represent the Virgin, or seventh month of the year, when the sun enters the lower hemisphere at the autumnal equinox. Thomas was also called Judas, 685 , and 'IoÚdaj Qwmaj = 1,735 , or 1 more than Dionysos, who also made a famous expedition into Indi a. Thus, the two brothers. Christ and Thomas ( d...dumoi ), symbolize the male and female powers of the Logos. In the English calendar the feast of St. Thomas is the sixth in order, which again connects it with the double potency. The Epiphany occurs in the 6 th week, and 39 th day of the year. This festival signified the manifestation of Christ, and in Greek Epiphaneia yields 662 + 1 = 663 , which is the diameter of a circle having a circumference equal to the side of the Holy Oblation.

Although chronology has been said to be the soul of history, there is yet another source from which literary composition received an i nspira - tion corresponding to the divine afflatus breathed into the nostrils of Adam at his creation.

For Jesus ( 'Ihsoàj ) is a name arithmetically sym - bolical , consistingof six letters, and is known by all those that belong to the called .” (Irenæus, “Against Heresies,” bk. i., ch. xiv.)"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 350 corresponding to the body, and the Tradition or unwritten word to the soul. Now since the written Law, as we all know, can only be inter - preted by the oral tradition, it is highly important that this spirit, which is said to vivify and impart meaning to the letter, should be sought for and studie d. Perhaps to make the analogy between the soul and the body more complete, the old philosophers always kept the oral law a secret, so that its operation was conducted invisibly and inscrutably like its counterpart in nature. At any rate the mysteries, which it unfolded to those who knew it, have never been communicated to the outer world. The oral tradition of the Hebrews was also double, being called Masorah and Cabala, or that which was delivered and that which was received. Now these two are presu mably the Logos and Psyche of the Greeks, or the double soul, which was supposed to exist in the body of every man. In a passage quoted by Menasseh Ben Israel (“Conciliator,” vol. i., p. 207 ) it is said that angels, in descending to the elemental worl d, incorporate themselves with the law. The whole section is purposely obscure, but the words associating the soul of the law with the descent of angels to the sublunary world, are clear enough. According to R. Isaac Abarbanel, the name Elohim denotes “the relation between the creative power that bestows, and his creatures that receive; it is like - wise applied to those created beings who by means of their official situation, bestow on others who receive. Hence angels are called Elohim, as they are t he divine instruments to bestow his blessings on the world.” Cornelius Agrippa (“Occult Philosophy,” p. 215 ) mentions ten orders of the blessed, with ten archangels, corresponding to one of the cabalistic steps and one of the cele -"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 351 stial spheres, viz., Primum Mobile, Zodiac, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, and the elementary world. We also learn from the Talmud, that “the dis - tance from the earth to the firmament is 500 years journey, and so it is from each successive firmament to the next throughout the series of the seven heavens. 1 ‘Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures’ (Ezek. i. 15 ). Rabbi Eleazar says, it was an angel who stood upon the earth, and his head reached to the li ving creatures . It is recorded in a Mishna that his name is Sandalphon, who towers above his fellow - angels to a height of 500 years’ journey: he stands behind the chariot and binds crowns on the head of his creator.” In the liturgy of the Feast of Ta bernacles, it is said, that “Sandalphon gathers in his hands the prayers of Israel, and, forming a wreath of them, he adjures it to ascend as an orb for the head of the Supreme King of Kings.” (Hershon’s “Talmudic Miscellany,” p. 1 To account for Moses having omitted to mention the creation of the planets or the angels, Bishop Wilkins quotes Mr. Wright and other authorities, as follows: “’Tis not the endeavour of Moses, or theProphets, to discover any Mathematical or Philosophical subtleties, but rather to accommodate themselves to vulgar capacities, and ordinary speech, as nurses are wont to use to their Infants . . . . But ’tis certain (saith Calvin ) that this purpose is to treat only of the visible form of the world, and those parts of it, which might be most easily understood by the Ignorant and Ruder sort of people, and therefore we are not to expect the discovery of any Natural Secret. As for more hidden arts, they must be looked for elsewhere; the Holy Ghost did here intend to instruc t all without exception. . . . And there - fore too, Aquinas observes, that he writes nothing of the Air, because that being invisible, the People knew not whether there were any such Body or no. And for this reason St. Jerom also thinks, that there is no thing exprest concerning the creation of Angels because the rude and ignorant Vulgar were not so capable of apprehending their Natures” (“Discovery of a New World,” 1684 , p. 22 , by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester)."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 352 250 ). The height of San dalphon would be ( 500 × 8 =) 4,000 years’ journey, or 1 more than 3,999 . See p. 370 . Again, Plato’s description of Eros (Love), exactly agrees with this angel of the Hebrews. “These spirits ( da...monej ) or intermediate powers,” he says, “are many and di verse, and one of them is Eros (Love). He is a great spirit, and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and mortal. . . . He interprets between gods and men, conveying and taking across the prayers and sacri - fices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the Gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them, and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries, and charms and all prophecy and incan - tation find their way. For God mingles not with man; but through Eros all intercourse and con - verse of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on.” (Symposium.) One of the difficulties which the theology of the ancients attempted to explain was the problem of human generation. Having assumed that man was a twofold being with a soul and a body, and that his soul was a scintillation of the divine essence derived from the sphere of the fixed stars or Milky Way, it was necessary to su ggest the means by which the immortal soul reached its earthly dwell - ing. For this purpose the ten cabalistic steps, personified by Eros, Sandalphon, or Macropro - sopus, were devised, and afforded the hypothetical ladder by which souls descended to the e lemental world. The five books of the Law written accord - ing to this mystical hypothesis, imitated by its symbolical composition the order of creation. But the Mosaic method of philosophizing will perhaps be made clearer by the testimony of numbers."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 353 Th e Law was said to have been first written on a roll by Moses himself, from the B ( beth ) of Brashith , the first letter of the first word in Genesis to the L ( lamed ) of Isral , the last letter of the last word in Deuteronomy (“Talmud, Treatise, Bava bathra,” ch. i., fol. 15 ). Thus the whole fabric of the law is included between these two letters. Now the numerical value of Beth is 2 , and that of Lamed is 30 ; and 2 + 30 = 32 , which is the square root of 1,024 , the radius of Saturn’s orbit. Again, the tw o words Brashith , 913 , and Isral , 541 , express the twofold principle corresponding to Masorah and Cabala, whilst 913 + 541 = 1,454 . or one less than the value of Adam Kadmon, the celestial Adam or Macroprosopus, who in one sense comprehends the whole te n steps of the diagram in his body, and conveyed the spirit of life to the earth. Since it was supposed that the generation of the world was accomplished after the manner of men, we must conceive the Macrocosm or celestial Adam stretched within the sphere of the Zodiac, so that the centre of his body (the phallus) coincides with the centre of the universe occupied by the earth and the elements. And since the earth was philo - sophically considered to be the mother or receptive power in the planetary syst em, she was figuratively said to have conceived and brought forth the prim - æval man, the earth - born Adam, the son of the supernal Adam. Thus, according to the Hebrews, the race of mortals was produced; and the spirit of life having been implanted in the body of the First Man he transmitted it through Eve to all subse - quent generations.

How"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 354 so? Socrates . In both it is requisite that nature should be thoroughly investigated, the nature of the body in the one, and the nature of the soul in the other.” Let us literally follow the advice of Plato in investigating the progr ess of a human soul as far as our natural powers of observation will carry us. As far as human science can trace it the human soul in its passage through life exists in at least three distinct habitations, and in each case under very different circum stances. Beyond this, it may be said, that nothing else is positively known. The germ of life, which ultimately be - comes a human creature, first exists in the body of the man, whom we call its father. In the act of coition it is transmitted to the wo mb of the woman, whom we call its mother; and in the third stage of its known existence it is born into the world where, as a man or woman, it remains till death. Although some philosophers supposed that at the death of the body the soul evaporated and ceased to exist, it was generally held as a reason - able hypothesis grounded upon the analogy of its progressive existence, that the soul continued to live after death, and by returning to the stars from whence it came completed the cycle of its being. Th e first abode occupied by the soul in its mundane state is thus referred to in the New Testament: “And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him” (Heb. vi i. 9 , 10 ). The transition from the first abode to the second constitutes the soul’s first death and birth. The Greek initiate into the mysteries, having figura - tively passed through the region of Hades, was called difu»j , twice - born, and it was by the a nalogy borne by the first dissolution to the last, that the"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 355 ancients argued their doctrine of immortality. The evidence and hope of the resurrection was commonly demonstrated by the rising again of the Phœnix after complete decay. St. Cyril of Jerusale m says that God, knowing man’s unbelief, had provided the Phœnix to disclose his purpose. “This bird,” as Clement writes, and as many more relate, “the only one of its race, going to the land of the Egyptians at revolutions of 500 years, shows forth the r esurrection; and this, not in desert places, lest the mystery which comes to pass should remain unknown, but in a notable city, that men might even handle what they dis - believe. For it makes itself a nest of frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and entering into this when its years are fulfilled, it evidently dies and moulders away. Then from the mouldering flesh of the dead a worm springs, and this worm when grown large is transformed into a bird, etc.” (Cat. Lect. xviii.). The Phœnix is only another image of the Christ, whose crucifixion, burial and descent into Hell, and ultimate resurrection illustrate in another way the same order of nature. The next stage of the soul’s existence, when it reaches its second abode, is its period in the womb, the dark and gloomy place through which it was doomed to pass in its appointed course; when, in the symbolical language of the Greeks, it makes its descent into Hades. An ample description of the regions of Tartarus is given by Plato in the “Phaedo.” “One of the chasms of the earth,” he says, “is exceedingly large, and perforated through the entire earth, and is that which Homer speaks of, ‘very far off, where is the most profound abyss beneath the earth,’ which elsewhere both he and many other poets have called Tartaros. For into this chasm all rivers flow together, and from it flow out again.” Plato, who always “moralized” his"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 356 fables, pretended (for the benefit of the populace) that the wicked souls who were hurled into Tartaros perished and neve r came out again. “But those who are found to have lived an eminently holy life, these are they, who, being freed and set at large from these regions in the earth, as from a prison, arrive at the pure abode above, and dwell in the upper parts of the ear th.” 1 The Christian idea of Hades did not differ from that of Homer and Plato, as it is said of Christ in the Epistle to the Ephesians: “Now that He ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?” (ch. iv. 9 ): a nd the following extract from Tertullian is to the same purpose. “By ourselves the lower regions are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some subterranean sewer, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a concealed recess in its very bow els; inasmuch as we read that Christ in His death spent three days in the heart of the earth (Matt. xii. 40 ), that is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the earth . . . therefore keep at arm’s length those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful deserve a place in the lower regions. Those persons who are ‘servants above their Lord, and disciples above their Master,’ would no doubt spurn to receive the comfort of the resurrection, if they must expect it in Abraham's bosom (“De Anima,” cap. lv.). The allusion above to Abraham’s bosom is as important as it is peculiar, since this expression 1 In concluding the passage, that no on e may be deceived, he adds, “To affirm positively, indeed, that these things are as I have described them, does not become a man of sense; that, however, this or something of the kind takes place with respect to our souls and their habitations — since our soul is certainly immortal — this appears to be most fitting to be believed.”"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 357 denotes in the Gospel the place prepared for the reception of virtuous souls. Now everybody knows that “there was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day; and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels 1 into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died and was buried: and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame,” and so on (Luke, xvi. 19 - 24 ). The word kÒlpoj , euphemis tically translated “bosom” in the text, means the womb. In a previous chapter of the same treatise, Tertullian, affirming the corporeal nature of the soul in hell, draws attention to the fact that Lazarus is said to have a finger and the rich man a tongu e. Accord - ingly it may be supposed that Abraham’s bosom was also attached to a body. Now when Plato in the “Phædo” is describing the parts and structure of the earth it is evident that he is mystically referring to a woman’s body, the centre of which i s called by him Hades, and it may be concluded that the kÒlpoj 2 or “bosom” of Abraham, belongs to 1 In the “Selections from the Prophetic Scriptures,” the soul is said to enter the womb, “introduced by one of the angels who preside over generation” (“Ante - Nicene Library,” v ol. xxiv., p. 131 ). 2 Ð kÒlpoj 'Abra£m (Abraham’s bosom) has the numerical value of 685 ( 70 + 470 + 145 ), the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 2,151 , the number of years in the great month. “Adhj (Hell) yields 213 , the diameter of a circle hav ing a cir -"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 358 the same mystical body. We must consequently assume that the body of a woman was supposed by the philosophers to extend in an opposite direction to that of the Macrocosm in the manner depicted by Eliphas Levi, and the generative attributes thus meeting together in the middle of the universe explains the conjunction of the om - phalos and stauros at the earth’s centre. These two figures commonly symbolized b y a Solomon’s Seal will also represent the double soul of the law, Masorah and Cabala, the part of the man being to deliver, the part of the woman to receive. On issuing from the womb, provided with a substantial body, the soul begins the third term of i ts mundane life as a man. Of its waxing and waning upon earth it is hardly necessary to speak. But to the philosophers the sacredness of the body consisted in its being the receptacle or temple of a spark of the vital essence which they called God, for such they considered to be the soul of man. And the human creature having reached the full limit of his development was endowed with the supreme faculty of transmitting a portion of the soul within him, and thereby rendering himself immortal by adding a new link in the continuous chain of life whose beginning was in heaven. This much at least was knowledge: and those ascertained facts set forth in symbols and parables constituted the gnosis imparted to initiates at the celebration of the mysteries.

Tertullian tells us more than once that all souls flow from Adam. 1 For the chain of life was con - ceived like a series of threads which f ollowed backwards from son to father converge and meet in the first thread generated by the earth - born Adam. So when the body, worn out with age, succumbed at last to death, it was honoured with funeral rites, enacted in imitation of that former parting at the gates of Hades. Such was the meaning of the Egyptian ceremonies bestowed upon their dead, for by the analogy of the soul’s entrance into the world or body, with faith and hope they argued its exit into another, and looked forward to the complet ion of the full span of life when carried by the seven spirits, demons, angels, or wanderers ( plan»tai ) they should ascend to the firmament and join the everlasting choir of the stars. Or, as Origen puts it, “we hope, after the troubles and struggles whi ch we suffer here, to reach tie highest heavens, and receiving, agree - ably to the teaching of Jesus, the fountains of water that spring up unto eternal life, and being filled with the rivers of knowledge, shall be united with those waters that are said to be above the heavens, and which praise His name.

The custom of burying the dead in a contracted position (the knees being drawn up to the head) once practised by the ancient Peruvians and Egyptians still prevails in certain parts of Africa. “Some writers have expressed the opinion that the obje ct of burying a person in this position was to imitate that of a child in the womb of its mother, so that the man or woman's entrance into another world should to some extent resemble that of their entrance into this world” (H. N. Hutchinson, “Prehistor ic Man,” p. 209 ). The process of creation may be expressed by inscribing the cabalistic diagram in the upper hemisphere, so that the apex or crown reaches to the Milky Way, while the tenth step will coincide with the earth. By this means the ladder for t he descent of the soul may be reduced to specific measures, determining the sizes of the figures of which it is composed. Geometrically, the symbols of the three persons of the triad are, firstly, a pyramid or triangle; secondly, a cube or hexagon, a c ircle, or a saltire; thirdly, a vesica or rhombus, or a cross.

By adding a rhombus, whose sides are 222.9 , to repre - sent the Bride who occupies the tenth step, the diagram is complete and it only remains to depict upon it the figures of the persons. In the Zohar we are told that Macroprosopos is only represented by his head, which is fully described in the “Lesser Holy Assembly.” Now, if the greater man of Cesariano be drawn so as to occupy the entire extent of the diagram, his head will be found to be contained within the triangle formed by the first three steps which properly belong to him. The height of his body measures 892.9 , which is 1 and a fraction more than the value of Ouranos , Heaven, the Father o f the Gods, according to Hesiod. Another notable fact respecting the height of Macrocosmos in the diagram is that a rood - cross 892 high will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 1,656 , the distance of the tropics from the equator measured on t he earth’s circumference; and its extreme length is 1,274 3 / 4 , or the height of a cross which will crucify a man in a square having a perimeter of 2,368 . Then, if a circle be described round his body, and a square inscribed within it, we obtain a square whose sides are 630 .

That the pictures of the Christian Trinity were founded upon this diagram it is impossible to doubt. There is one in the National Gallery (No. 1478 ) by Giovanni Mansu eti, in which the cabalistic symbolism is very plainly discernible. The persons of the Great Triad are depicted in the ordinary canonical manner. The Father is seated with Christ on the Cross in front of Him, the Dove appearing to proceed from the Fathe r to the Son. Mary the Magdalene is represented upon the ground clasping the foot of the Cross and evidently personifying the tenth step. Mary the Virgin and St. John stand on either side, while the full number of the ten steps are completed in the persons of other saints.

Since the ten steps of the diagram astronomically represent the radius or interval between the firm - ament and the earth, the tenth step being assigned to the world in the middle of the universe, it is necess - ary to r epeat the figure twice in order to span the dia - meter of the sphere. In that case the two figures, the one occupying the upper hemisphere and the other the lower, provide a ladder by which souls descen - ding to the earth may return to heaven; and by thus completing the diagram there is presented a perfect image of the double soul of the world, shadowing forth the two laws, Masorah and Cabala, by the male power above and the female below, and likewise the two trees, the one of knowledge, the other of life, the two testaments, the old and new, comprehending the mystic cycle of birth, death, and resurrection. The man belonging to the upper hemisphere may be conceived standing upright in the midst of the spheres with his feet upon the earth, like the figure o f the Macrocosm in Caxton’s “Mirror of the World.” He is there shown in the circle four times repeated, thus producing the four arms of a cross. All four have their feet upon the earth, so that the figure in the lower hemisphere stands head downwards.

The Greeks also distributed the 24 letters of their alpha - bet to the members of the human body.

According to Brocardo (“On the Apocalypse,” p. 167 , translated by James Sanford, 1582 ), the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets symbolize the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. “Because ye olde Testament and worke of the Father was wryten in the Hebrew tongue: and so the Hebrew alphabet continued unto the coming of Christ: and there according to a certayne order ye worke doth end wrytten in ye Hebrew tongue. The worke of the Sonne ensueth wryt ten in the Greeke tongue: . . . ye worke of the Holy Ghost taketh place in ye Lord’s second cominge, while the Latine tonge doth declare the eventes that were told of things to come, and openeth the things written in ye Lawe, in ye Gosple, and in the Pr ophets, repeating all mysteries in ye two former tongues from the beginning.” The tradition that the Elohim taught the He - brew letters to Adam is of course a figure of speech, meaning, perhaps, that as all the parts of the universe were represented by the letters, and as the stars were considered to be the manifesta - tion of God, the alphabet might be said to have been revealed from heaven. The number of the Hebrew letters is 22 , consisting of 3 mother - letters, 12 simple, and 7 double. Each of the 12 simple letters corresponds to a sign of the Zodiac, and each of the 7 double letters to one of the planets. The 3 mother - letters are Aleph , the first, Mem , the thirteenth, and Shin , the twenty - first ( see Cabala, “Sepher Yetsirah,” translated by Dr. We stcott). The three divisions appear to denote the cabalistic triad, corresponding to Macrocosmos, the simple letters to Microcosmos, and the double letters to the Bride.

Then the width of a vesica 445 broad is 771 , the perimeter of the Holy Oblation taking the sun's distance at to ( 216 : 2,0833 :: 20 : 192.9 ). The third number, 709 , is the length of a vesica, which will contain a rhombus whose sides are equal to those of the New Jerusalem. It is also the side of a square whose diagonals measure 2,004 , the value of the names of the four elements in Greek, and 710 is the numerical equivalent of Pneuma Hagion , the Holy Ghost. Lastly if the two parts of the body of the Microcosm are united we get the number ( 445 + 709 =) 1.154 or the length of a vesica 666 broad. In their elaborate “refutations” of the Gnos tic heresies, the Fathers reveal, that the Greeks divided and distinguished their letters in much the same manner as the Hebrews, but no complete exposition of their system exists. In a treatise, “Against all Heresies,” attributed to Tertullian (ch. v.) , it is said: “After these there were not wanting a Marcus and Colarbasus, composing a novel heresy out of the Greek alphabet. For they affirm, that without those letters Truth cannot be found: nay more, that in those letters the whole plenitude and perfe ction of truth is comprised : for this was why Christ said, ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega.’ ” 1 1 This is the Colarbasus who, according to Hippolytus"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 368 At the beginning of the sixteenth century Cornelius Agrippa says that “the vowels in the Greek tongue, viz., a e h i o u w answer to the seven planets, b g d z k l m n p r s t are attributed to the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the other five, q x f c y , re - present the four elements, and the Spirit of the world.

Again we know from Manilius that the Roman astrologers located the signs of the Zodiac through - out the members of the body, and Marcus similarly ascribed two of the 24 letters to each of the 12 divisions, that the body, being a type of the alphabet as well as the universe, might serve as a rule for literary art.

Further, taking the proportions of a human figure to be 6 : 1 , a body 3,999 high is 666 1 / 2 b road. These numbers shadowing forth the figure of Christ and his Bride, suggest a reason for the name, Truth ( 'Al»qeia ), being bestowed upon the visionary figure of Marcus. Mention is made in the “Golden Legend” of an early rite practised at the dedicat ion of a church. The letters of the alphabet were inscribed on the floor in the form of a cross, which was no doubt an obscure way of indicating the body of the Microcosm. The symbolical association of the body with letters, the elements of words and t he basis of literature, discloses the last aspect of the canon to which we shall allude, namely, that application of it which was called Rhetoric. From its derivation the second of the seven sciences seems to have meant what the Hebrews called Cabala, or Tra - dition, the word `Rhtorik» , 616 , coming from `Rhtr» , 516 , an unwritten or oral law. Thus the traditional laws of Lycurgus were called `RÁtrai , 511 ; and Rhetoric may be taken to mean the unwritten law or canon of speech which supplied the means o f effecting an exact analogy between a set oration and the order of the universe — the conformity of any work to that order making it “canonical.” It is probably due to the objections of the Puritans that the art of Rhetoric is no longer taught, and that the methods of its former professors have passed into oblivion. Plato, however, has made the old manner of oratorical composition the subject 1 The number 426 is the side of a square enclosed by a rhombus whose sides are 671 , the numerical equivalent of Adonai the Bride, or third person of the Triad."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 371 of discussion in the “Phaedrus.” Socrates is there made to say, after inquiring whether the sentences in a s peech are written in any express order, “but this, at least, I think you will allow that every speech ought to be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own, so as neither to be without head nor without feet, but to have both middle and extremities;” and again, “All great arts require a subtle and speculative research into the law of nature. . . . But do you think it possible rightly to understand the nature of the soul, without understanding the nature of the universe?” In the “Recogni tions” of Clement, who lived in the Apostolic age and was a companion and disciple of St. Peter, the rhetorical manner of speech is alluded to more than once. In the twenty - first chapter (bk. i.), speaking of the postponement of his debate with Simon M agus, the apostle says, “I believe that it has been done by the providence of God for your advantage: that I may be able in this interval of seven days to expound to you the method of our faith without any distraction, and the order continuously accord ing to the tradition of the true Prophet, who alone knows the past as it was, the present as it is, and the future as it shall be: which things were indeed plainly spoken by Him, but not plainly written : 1 so much so that they 1 “Our prophets did know of greater things than any in the Scriptures, but which they did not commit to writing.

John also is recorded to have seen and done a similar thing. Nay, Paul even heard ‘un - speakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.’ And it is related of Jesus, who was greater than all those, that He conversed with His disciples in private, and especially in their secret retreats, concerning the Gospel of God; but the words which he utte red have not been preserved, because it"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 372 cannot be understood withou t an expounder.” And in the twenty - fourth chapter (bk. iii.), he de - clares that “the teaching of all doctrine has a certain order and there are some things which must be delivered first, others in the second place, and others in the third, and so all in their order: and if those things be delivered in their order, they become plain: but if they be brought forward out of order they will seem to be spoken against reason. And therefore order is to be observed above all things, if we seek for the purpose o f finding what we seek. For he who enters rightly upon the road will observe the second place in due order, and from the second will more easily find the third; and the further he proceeds so much the more will the way of knowledge become open to him e ven till he arrive at the City of Truth.” Lord Bacon has also left some dark hints on the mystic or traditional teaching of Rhetoric. In the “Advancement of Learning” (bk. ii., ch. 2 ), he says, “Let us now come to the doctrine concerning the Method of S peech. This hath been handled as a part of Logick, so it hath found a place in Rhetorick by the name of Disposition. But the placing of it as a part of the Train of other Arts, hath been the cause that many, things which refer unto it, and are useful t o be known, are preter - missed: wherefore we thought good to constitute a substantial and principal doctrine touching Method , which by a general name we call the wisdom of Tradition . . . . “Wherefore let the first difference of Method be set down to be e ither Magistral or Initiative; neither do we understand the word initiative , as if this should lay the groundwork, the other raise the appeared to the evangelists that they could not be adequately conveyed to the multitude in writing or in speech” (Origen, “Against Celsus,” Bk.vi., ch. 6 )."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 373 perfect building of sciences; but in a far different sense (borrowing the word from sacred ceremonies), we call that Ini tiative Method which discloses and unveils the mysteries of knowledges. . . .

The most ca reless reader who has merely turned over the leaves of a few old books cannot have failed to notice the striking difference between them and the works of the present day. The reason for this manifest diversity seems to be that nowadays the old canon of rhetoric, which pre - scribed the order of a discourse, has ceased to be used in literary composition. And since the pre - ceding quotations refer to the existence of a definite rule determining the symbolic form of a speech we shall now endeavour to show mo re specifically what that canon was and how it was applied. Each letter of the Hebrew or Phœnician alp habet has a symbol corresponding to it. Nothing appears to be known of these primitive symbols now but their names; however, in the twenty -two trump cards of the Tarot we possess a series of hiero - glyphs corresponding to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The origin of these twenty -two cards is dubious, but it has been surmized that they are of Egyptian extraction. In any case they were con - nected w ith the Hebrew letters in the fifteenth century, specimens of that date being still extant, and they certainly represent an authentic and fun - damental version of the ideas formerly associated with the primitive alphabet believed to be of Phœnician origin. 1 1 “The Phœnicians who came with Cadmus . . . . intro- duce d . . . . among other things letters, with which, as I conceive, the Greeks were unacquainted.

A glance at the figure (p. 365 ) will explain the disposition of the letters.

The similarity between the Phœnician, Greek, and Hebrew alphabets will be evident upon a reference to Rawlin - son’s “History of Phœnicia” (p. 379 ). Mr. Rawlinson observes that the people who invented letters have left us no literature — the Sanchoniathon being only kn own in a Greek translation, and the inscriptions being few and of limited range. But he does not notice what is even more curious, that the Hebrews, whose alphabet (according to the traditions) was far older than that of the Phœnicians, have left neither inscriptions nor docu- ments of any antiquity.

In fact the rhetorical canon enabled the poet or philosopher to inspire his work with an invisible spirit in the s emblance of that which also animated the universal scheme of nature, and gave his writing an allegorical sense hidden from the vulgar or uninstructed reader. The upper half of the diagram symbolized the germ of life in its descent or fall, the lower half the ascent or resurrection — the two together embodying the entire compass of human existence. The great canonical works of the Greeks and Christians appear to be arranged in accordance with this division. The Old Testament in describ - ing the events from the generation of the world to the incarnation of Christ metaphorically illustrates the “fall” of the soul from heaven to earth, the deity of the Hebrew writers being conceived as residing in heaven. But in the second of the two Testaments God becomes incarnate upon earth and, as Athanasius says (“Incarnation of Jesus Christ”), “What Adam brought down from heaven to earth 1 Christ carried up from earth to heaven.” In this aspect the Iliad and the Odyssey accord with the Christian Testaments, for the epic of the Trojan War affords an exact parallel to the mystical history, of the scriptures. The Greek heroes who set sail against Troy (the sublunary world) are, like the patriarchs, incarnations of the sephiroth. 2 Their encounter with the Trojans, 1 According to Origen, “t he soul of our Saviour was the same that was in Adam” (Preface to Henry More’s Works, p. xxiii).

In itineraries like that of Pausanias or Sir John Mandeville, or in the description of cities like the Mirabilia Romæ the same mystical rule seems to be observed. Whenever there is a sequence in the painted or sculptured ornaments of a temple they are disposed in like order. The verses and stanzas of the old poets, the paragraphs and chapters of the prose writers may be devised with similar purpose, so that the allegory may be expressed with all the manifold resources of pictorial, plastic, or literary art. To fully substantiate so sweeping a generaliza - tion would of course require nothing less than ”that neither Hera, nor Athene, or Zeus are what those persons suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and groves, but are parts of Nature and certain arrangements of the El ements.” And he said that Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon, with Helen and Paris were merely allegorical creations, and never had any real existence (Tatian, “Address to the Greeks,” ch. xxi.).

However, having something further to say on the subject, we hope that a final judgment may be postponed, till the question receives a more adequate and systematic treatment. Francis Roberts (“Key of the Bible,” 1649 ) gives certain rules for the gaining of scripture knowledge. On page 34 , he advises “the prudent use of Logick , for orderly and methodical resolu - tion of the text, and the subservient helps of other Arts as Rhetorick , Natural Philosophy , etc., with - out which it is impossible satisfactorily to interpret the scriptures. For, as Ambrose well observes, ‘though Penmen of Scripture wrote not according to Art . . . yet they that have written of Art, have found an Art in their writings.’ ” The Jews divided the Old Testament like the Iliad into twenty - four books, and these again had a threefold division corresponding to the three persons of the great triad of the cabala. The Law, consisting of five book s and fifty - four 1 sections ( siderim ) or “orders,” constitutes the first division. The Pro - phets, or second division, included the following eight works: — Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, together with Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve minor Proph ets. The third division, called the Writings ( Hagiographa ) was composed of the eleven remaining books, namely, Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra (with Nehe - miah), and Chronicles.

But although this might be done, we find that amongst Christians the sequence of the books w as one of the secrets imparted to initiates at their preparation for baptism. In his fourth lecture St. Cyril enumerates them in what was evidently their esoteric order, by which their true symbolic significance could be ascertained, and it may be accep ted as the traditional order having the authority of the Church. In treating the cabalistic steps we have hereto - fore considered that they represented the elements, the Zodiac with the seven planets, and the Primum Mobile; but the celestial circles may be extended by the addition of nine angelic spheres, while each of the four elements may be counted separately, thus making twenty - two circles or steps.

So it is not always easy to follow the metaphorical allusions. No one, of course, can readily perceive the af finity between the divisions of a canonical work and the twenty - two hieroglyphs without first committing the latter to memory. Then comes the most serious diffi - culty — that of discerning the various meanings of each. An explicit interpretation of them does not exist, but the “Tarot,” by Papus, and the remarks on the subject by Eliphaz Levi may be referred to. God has ever been the supreme symbol of human nescience; for by that name there is sug - gested all that we do not know concerning the remote cause o f things. Accordingly, “one thinks He is made of fire. . . . The Epicureans that He is idle and inactive and so to speak a nobody in human affairs. Then the Stoics represent Him as placed outside the world whirling round this huge mass from without like a potter; while the Platonists place Him within the world, as a pilot is in the ship he steers.” Other conceptions even more curious and barbarous than these will at once occur to each of us. In fact we begin to doubt whether the fool who said in his h eart “there is no God,” was after all so much worse than the many who have made assertions to the contrary. But though no one does, or ever did, know any - thing about the gods, the more one studies the ancient scriptures the more one sees that this very la ck of knowledge made theology the one theme which allowed unlimited scope for the imagination or humour of the artist. No absurdities were too grotesque to apply to a god and no humour too broad. Hyperbole was the sanctioned vehicle of expression; poets and artists vying with each other in the gross monstrosity as well as the sublimity of their productions. But all this is"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 382 wasted upon the serious people who nowadays monopolize religion, for they neither admire the delicacy and art in the handling of a difficult subject, nor laugh at the cruder caricature of a coarser wit. And since the gods are but the reflex of their creators, what more natural than that the fortune - tellers and mountebanks for whom the Tarot was designed should have regarded the make r of heaven and earth as a juggler, and the feat of creation as an inexplicable trick? With this apt conceit the series of the twenty -two symbols begins; and from it we derive some of the ideas connected with the number one . By some type or emblem the first division of a canonical work ought to express a suggestion of the primary principle. This is obviously done in the book of Genesis, wherein the manifestation of the deity, the creation of the world and its history for 2,368 1 years, are obscurely set forth. Briefly, the first hieroglyph represents the be - ginning and first cause of things —in Nature the universal life, in persons the god, king, chief, father or generator, in astronomy the empyreum, in geometry a point, and so on, with a similar fig ure appropriate to each of the arts and sciences. In his preface to the “Kabbalah Unveiled”, Mr. Mathers complains of the shameful suppression in mod - ern times of all references to the feminine princi ple in theology. At an earlier period they were less re ticent. So the histories include a female Pope, 2 who per - 1 See F. Roberts, “Key of the Bible,” 1649 , p. 9 . 2 The inclusion of Pope Joan in the order of the Popes seems to be accounted for by chronological reasons. In the list of Ciaconius (tom. i., fol. 626 ), under the name of John VIII., she follows Leo IV., who died in 855, and was the 105 th Pope in order. Pope Joan, therefore, was the 106 th. Now 106 is the diameter of a circle 333 in circumference, and"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 383 sonifies the number two in the Tarot. She is the Vicar of Christ in his feminine capacity. In the Pythagorean system the number one was generally considered to be male, the number two female, and the number three the union of both, thus making the second person of the Triad a woman; and from an old English homily for Trinity Sunday we learn that “the fourme of the Trinity was founden in man, that was Adam our forefadir, of earth oon personne, a nd Eve of Adam the seconde personne; and of them both was the thirde per - son” (Strutt’s “Manners and Customs,” vol. iii., p. 176 ; see Oliver’s “Pythag. Triangle,” p. 98 ). But the number two was sometimes regarded as a masculine power as in the case of the second step in the Cabala, where it refers to the Logos or the emanation of the male. The Mohammedan idea of the Christian Trinity is thus expressed in the fourth chapter of the Koran, “Jesus (the son of Mary) is the apostle of God and his Word, w hich he conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him.” As representing the double potency in creation, the second hieroglyph signifies the feminine essence of life. The departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, the crossing of the Red S ea and the wandering in the desert may be interpreted as an image of the transition of the soul, the Israelites being likened to the stars or germs of life in the firmament (see Sir W. Drummond, “Œdipus 333 is the di agonal of the New Jerusalem, emblem of the Bride. And the circumference of a circle 855 in diameter is equal to the perimeter of a rhombus, whose sides are 671 ¾ , or the numerical equivalent of Thorah and Adonai. Like St. Helena this famous lady was s aid to have been an English girl. And in the guise of a priest she lived many years with a reputation for great learning, and for a time also for piety ( see Boccaccio, “De mulieribus Claris,” 1539 , p. 73 )."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 384 Judaicus,” and Gerald Massey, “Book of Be - ginnings”) . The upper Triad is completed by the third hieroglyph, which is represented in the Tarot by the Empress, for the Christians usually assigned a feminine personification to the third person of the Trinity. She corresponds to Mary the Virgin as contrasted w ith Mary the Magdalen, 1 who belongs to the tenth step. These three steps typify God ( Macrocosmos , 831 ) as the Father and Husband of the universe, as Philo says. The exposition of the Law (Thorah) in Leviticus makes that book appropriate to the number thr ee. The fourth card of the Tarot bears upon it the figure of an Emperor seated on a throne. And Daleth , the letter whose numerical equivalent is 4 , signifies a door or the womb. This hieroglyph added to the Triad represent the material terms of creatio n. From these two is generated the fifth power personified in the Tarot by the Pope, who is the earthly substitute or vicar of the Logos. The Spirit of the world, says Cornelius Agrippa, was called the quintessence, that is, the fifth essence, which exis ted above the four elements and per - vaded the Æther or planetary system (bk. i., ch. xiv). In his “Address to the Greeks” (ch. xii.), Tatian says “we recognize two varieties of spirit, one of which is called the soul ( yuc» ), but the other is greater t han the soul [viz., Logos , see ch. vii., ibid .], an image and likeness of God: both existed in the first man.” The number six repre - sented the mingling together of these two. It is an emblem of Psyche, whose marriage is so beauti - fully portrayed by Apu leius in the sixth chapter of 1 Bacon says that the ancients conceived matter as a courtezan (“Advancement of Learning,” bk. ii., ch. 13 )."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"RHETORIC. 385 “The Golden Ass.” In the order of progression the number six marks the time of conception, and if we count nine for the months of gestation, the period of birth would be fulfilled at the four - teenth step. It was perhaps f or this reason that the sonnet was composed of 14 lines, embracing the complete cycle of human life. The steps from 1 to 5 are also a complete cycle, whence probably Moses chose this number for the books of the Law. Again, the 6 steps of the Cabala fr om the third to the tenth make up the body of Microcosmos, and he is evidently personified by Joshua, whose name is written 'Ihsoàj , Jesus by Josephus and the Seventy ( IHS H O , Joshua, yields 385 and a vesica 384.2 broad is 666 long). The next two symbols are too obscure to be explained briefly. A reference to the ninth step is quoted on page 363 . In the ninth book of the “Book of the Dead” (Turin MS.), the soul of the deceased comes to the Ark of Osiris and the Hill of Bat. 1 Now, if the reader will t urn to the diagram on page 365 he will see that the ninth step forms one of the extremities of a cross whose centre is in the tenth. Hippolytus tells us that Noah’s Ark was turned round upon Mount Kardu ( cardo ) towards the four cardinal points of the world, and “finally stood towards the East. We say, moreover, that that was a sign of the Cross. And the ark was a symbol of the Christ who was expected” (“Ante - Nicene Library,” vol. vi., p. 495 ). An examination of the tenth hieroglyph of the Tarot makes this clearer; for the Wheel of Fortune is an obvious representation of the planets revolving round the navel or centre of the world.

He r twofold body, the hinder parts being those of a lion, seem to refer to the fact that she sits on the horizon between the upper and lower hemisphere; the figures on either side are apparently personifications of the eleventh and twelfth steps or the eq uinoxes. The name Sf...gx (Sphinx) has the value of 773 , or the perimeter of the Holy Oblation taking the sun's distance at 10 . St. Clement (“Miscell.,” bk. v., ch. 8 ), says, “The sphinx is not the comprehension of the universe, and the revolution of the world, accord - ing to the poet Aratus . . . But it is better to regard it as the Ether, which holds together and presses all things.” By gematria Sphinx is equi - valent to Syrinx, the pipe of seven reeds shown in the hand of Pan (fig. 25 ). And doubtless her well -known riddle, whose answer was a Man, mystically adumbrated the Microcosm whose body is measured by the number 773 . Or can it be a purely accidental coincidence that the name of Œdipus ( Ð o„d...pouj , the swollen-footed) should have the value o f 514 + 2 = 516 , the side of a rhombus whose perimeter is equal to the mean diameter of the spheres of Saturn and the Zodiac? The Hebrew word ODN (Eden) has the same numerical value, and must be regarded as an analogous place in biblical mythology. The Mount of Purgatory, described by Dante, had 7 terraces, the Terrestrial Paradise being at its summit. It is, of course, an image of the 7 planetary orbits surrounding the earth which stands in the diagram intermediate between Heaven, the upper hemi - sph ere, and Hell, the lower; and Botticelli’s design seems to show that he conceived it in this cosmic sense.

The cross in the centre of the world also repre - sents the Elements, or the universal matter, out of which the body of the Logos was compounded; an d the incarnation of the soul upon earth was symbolized among Christians by Jesus and his earthly parents, Joseph and Mary. Their names have the value of 2,598 + 3 = 2,601 , which is the side of a square enclosing the Microcosm crucified on a rood - cross i nscribed within the earth’s circum - ference.

It is further remarkable that a 1 The names of the five earliest races of men mentioned by Hesiod are derived from the minerals of which the earth is largely composed, viz., gold, silver, brass, earth, a nd iron.

In St. Cyril’s Canon the Book of Chronicles, called in Hebrew the “words of days,” 1 has the 10 th place. It begins with the generation of the sons of Adam and gives a recapitulation of the events narrated in the previous books. By the philosophi c method of addition 10 is reduced to 1 ( 1 + 0 = 1 ). Therefore the history in the tenth book is the going - back to the beginning and original starting point. And the incarnation of the soul being accomplished in Adam and his suc - cessors, the genealogy of Chronicles fitly expresses man’s birth and heritage of the earth down to the time of its composition. The symbols of the tenth step, referring as they do to the universe, the elements, and the earth, are very numerous. For instance, as the genetrix or mother of men, the earth was conceived as a loom. For she as the woman was said to weave the purple web of flesh with which the soul is invested as with a garment. So Persephone “is repre - sented by Orpheus as weaving a web, and the heavens are called by the ancients a veil, in conse - quence of being, as it were, the vestment of the celestial gods.” (Porphyry, “Cave of the Nymphs”). By poets, priests, and craftsmen she was idealized in countless forms as the emblem of productive Art. And for this re ason apparently Plato in the tenth book of the “Republic” pictured Necessity as a spinster bearing a mighty distaff having 7 whorls, corresponding to the planetary orbits. With her three daughters, the Fates, who correspond to the 11 th, 12 th, and 13 th steps, she seems to be an image similar to the Wheel of Fortune in the Tarot.

This herb was said to have a black root and a white (milky) blossom; by gematria it is equivalent to Stauros . The 11 th and 12 th steps, marking the two points on the horizon, may be taken to be the two poles, the two equinoxes or solstices. And the 12 th book of the Odyssey relates how Odysseus passes the monsters Scylla , 688 , and Charybdis , 1,317 , 1 which appear to be hyperbol ical personifications of these; for 688 + 1,317 = 2,005 , or the internal width of an ark whose outer measure is 2,083 . In the “Book of the Dead” it is at the 11 th chapter that the soul of the deceased reaches the Hall of the Two Laws , so it is possible that they also refer to these positive and negative symbols. The 12 th card of the Tarot plainly sets forth one aspect of the hieroglyph. A man is represented hanging head downwards from a beam resting upon two trees, each having 6 lopped branches. Now since the earth turns once upon its axis every 24 hours, the 12 th hour divides the day from the night; accord - ingly, when the soul has passed the 12 th step it metaphorically enters the lower hemisphere. This is indicated by the man hanging head downwar ds. The writer of the book of Esther (the 12 th on St. Cyril’s list) makes use of this very metaphor. For the hanging of the malefactor, Haman, and the release of the just Mordecai through the inter - cession of Queen Esther 2 is the Old Testament type of the crucifixion — the gallows of the Hanged Man of the Tarot being a foreshadowing of the cross and the 12 disciples. 1 688 × 3 1 / 7 = 2,162 , and 1,317 is the width of an ark 7,902 long, the polar diameter of the eart h. 2 AST H R = 661 ."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 390 The five hieroglyphs, the 9 th, l 0 th, 11 th, 12 th, and 13 th, occupying the middle and extremities of the cross, may be all connected with t he world, or Malchuth; thus Odysseus makes his descent into Hades in the 11 th book of the Odyssey. But the 13 th is essentially the symbol of the lower hemi - sphere, corresponding in the underworld to the first step above. It is called “Death” in the Taro t, and has the signification of a woman. Its hieroglyphic meaning is adumbrated in the Book of Job — a treatise so greatly admired by the old theologians that it was considered the masterpiece of the Old Testament. The name Job means “the assailed” in He brew, and has the value of 19 ; so it is equi - valent by gematria to Eve. At this point the soul has crossed the line, so to speak, and enters the threshold of death, or Hell; and when depicting the exaggerated trials and dangers of the passage the ancien ts placed no limits upon their imagina - tion, as when the old artists delighted to paint the agonies of Christ on the cross and all the cruelties of the Passion. So we find upon the 13 th card of the Tarot a grisly skeleton remorselessly cutting off huma n heads and hands with a scythe. From a statement in the “Court of the Gentiles” we gather that the Book of Job was the oldest dialogue ever written, and that its form had a sym - bolic meaning.

B ut for comforts in captivity, the Scriptures have store: the three children were in bondage: so was Daniel, so were others of the Prophets: but they never wanted God their comforter. No more did He here abandon His faithful; being under the command of ba rbarous men, who forsook not His Prophet being even in the belly of a beast. This now they with whom we are to deal, had rather scorn than believe, yet of that fable in their own books they are fully persuaded, namely, that that same excellent harper Ar ion of Methymna, being cast overboard, was taken up on a dolphin’s back, and so borne safe to land. Is our history of Jonas more incredible than this? Yes, because it is more admirable; and it is more admirable, because more powerful” ( compare with the 1 3 th book of the same work ). Sir John Maundeville describes the country of Job in the fourteenth chapter of his “Travels,” and so carries us a step further than St. Cyril. He says that Job was a paynim, but served God well “after his Law,” and that in hi s land “there been Hills where men getten great plenty of Manna . . . this Mana is clept Bread of Angels.” In the Tarot a winged figure is shown to pour liquid from one vessel into another. The moral inculcated is Temperance.

The 15 th step completes the upper Triad in the underworld, and is represented by the Devil, who is simply Macrocosmos in the lower hemisphere. The received manner of dep icting the evil one was after the fashion of Pan (fig. 25 ); and it is extremely curious that the numerical values of the names applied to him are identical with those of the good deity. Thus Satanas yields 753 , the diameter of a circle whose circumferen ce is 2,368 ; Antichristos , 1,841 , when read backwards makes 1,481 , but 193.6 , the diameter of the Holy Oblation multiplied by 9.5 , produces 1,839.2 ; again Ophis , the Serpent, is equivalent by Gematria to Sophia , wisdom; and T H LI , dragon, and AMT H , truth, have each the same numerical value, and are equal by Gematria to To agathon , the good.

In the Apocalypse, whose chapters correspond with the canonical symbols, the City of the Bride is described in the 21 st 2 and 22 nd chapters. The last design of the Tarot, called “The World,” depicts that image of Thorah, 3 the Law, under which she appeared in heaven as a \"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of 12 stars,\" or as the Christian counterpart of her classic prototype Helen, the daughter of Zeus, ever adored as the feminine ideal of beauty, love, and nature by all old artists, and glorified by the priest as the virgin, bride, and mother, who sets forth the three phases of womanhood exhibited in the threefold sequence of the Cabala. Pythagoras defined the soul as being composed 1 “Hinc etiam elicimus, quod vera, genuina atque visiblis hominis externi figura veram crucuis Christi effigiem repraesentet.” See fig. 8 , p . 54 , of the present volume. 2 The 22 nd card is numbered 21 , the 21 st card being un - numbered. 3 Thorah means “gate,” and is similar to the Greek qÚra , which yields 510 , or the side of a rhombus having a perimeter equal to the diamter of Saturn’s orbit."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"THE CANON. 394 of noàj , fr»n , and qumÒj , understanding, reason, and anger, whose numbers amount to 2,097 – 3 = 2,094 , the diameter of the zodiac.

The application of the order of ideas which we have attempted to describe may be seen in a short piece like the Apostles’ Creed, forming a part of the avowedly canonical ritual of the English Common Prayer. The tradition, according to Amb rose, is that the twelve Apostles assembled together and made the creed, each of them insert - ing an article. It thus acquired a cosmic significance from being an image of the zodiacal circle. Although it was unknown to the Greeks, it was greatly esteem ed in the Western Church. It was called the symbolum, and was secretly preserved unwritten , being one of the mysteries communi - cated to the baptized at their initiation. In the English Church it is printed with only three sec - tions, and these manifestly correspond to the Cabalistic Triad, or the Persons of the Trinity, whom the initiated in the early Church secretly confessed as the all - embracing summary of their faith. The subdivisions of the Prayer - book are marked thus, ¶, and the Creed occupies the 13 th division in the Morning Prayer, and the 9 th in the Evening Prayer, or, counting from the be - ginning, the 34 th. Now it has been shown that the steps from the 9 th to the 13 th typify the Zodiac, since they comprise the centre and ex - tremities of the mundane cross, or “cosmic wheel.” And if the diagram (p. 365 ) be continued and another link added to the chain, the 34 th step corresponds to the 10 th and 22 nd, each of which is an emblem of the world. In this way much light will be thrown upon old book s if they be studied in connexion with this order.

The divisions of the New Testament, according to St. Cyril, amount to 26 , the number of the Tetragrammaton. He omits the Apocalypse j ust as other early canons are without the Epistle to the Hebrews. The authorship of the four versions of the life of Christ being attributed to persons typi - fying the four corner signs of the Zodiac, the Man, the Lion, the Bull, and the Eagle, the astron omical sense of the parable is disclosed. And the name eÙaggšlion , 577 , the “good news,” appears to have been chosen with the same mystical intention, for a Solomon’s seal whose sides are 577.2 is enclosed by a circle 666 in diameter and 2,093 in circum - ference. It has already been shown (pp. 56 - 57 ) that these numbers supply the key to the cosmic aspect of the Christian theology, and suggest the true nature of the Microcosmic Man personified in the Gospels by the Saviour. Biblos , 314 , the first word of the New Testament, has a similar meaning, since a vesica 314 wide is formed by two intersecting circles whose united width is 942 , the diagonal of a square whose sides are 666 . And both these names are indirectly equivalent to Paradosis , T RADITION , whose numerical value is 666 . The numbers 137 deduced from QBLH, Cabala, has the same import as 1480 , for the square con - tained within the zodiac, if the sun's distance be taken at 10 , is 136.9 ; and ZHR, Zohar, the name of the principal cabalistic treatise, yie lds 212 , the diameter of a circle 666 in circumference.

Besides, a treatise on the sub ject is a superfluity nowadays, the moral features of religion have become so exceedingly popular that everyone knows how to be good, if no one wishes to be so. Morals, of course, are merely customs ( mores ). Each code is a local and tem - poral affair, c onstructed to suit the exigencies of the time and place, and no more states the law finally and absolutely than any one of the extant theologies states the true nature of the deity. Still the attempt to demonstrate (however unsuc - cessfully) that a mora l, or rather a beneficent pur - pose is involved in the operations of nature, will always touch a chord deep - rooted in our hearts. And if there is any analogy between the soul of man and the soul of the universe, the moral sense, which is undoubtedly thou gh strangely manifested in each of us, must have its counterpart in the Logos or soul of all. We have not tried to defend the priests for having deceived the multitude, or to uphold their doctrines now or in the past. Nor have we sought to make an idol of antiquity. But in looking back we see the same mad, foolish, credulous, and in - credible world, which is here to - day, with its infinite capacity for being tricked and imposed upon, for establishing and supporting the absurdest institutions; while, i n extenuation of their guilt, it must be conceded that the saner could hardly be - queath their wisdom to a populace, which in all ages has persistently declined to inherit it.

When the Egyptian Theuth invented the alphabet he showed it to King Thamus, declaring that the knowledge of letters would be an incentive to wisd om and a medicine for memory. But the king replied, “Most ingenious Theuth, one per - son is able to give birth to art, another to judge of what amount of detriment or advantage it will be to those who use it, and now you, as being the father of letter s, out of fondness have attributed to them just the contrary effect to that which they will have.
